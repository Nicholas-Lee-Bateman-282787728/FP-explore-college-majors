6991211,5,B00SKFJH1K,"This is a debut from director and writer Vanessa Lapa; and she has taken for her subject one of the architects of the horrors of WWII - Heinrich Himmler. Using diary entries that were found when the Allies reached his house in 1945 as well as letters from those concerned she builds up a disturbing picture of the man who is often put down as a `chicken farmer' .
*The Following has a couple of plot reveals if that is the right phrase.*
He helped Hitler achieve his nightmare and facilitated `the Final Solution'. We also get to see how his children loved him and the devotion he inspired in his personal life - to prove his German efficiency he actually numbered his love letters. His views are far right from the very start and he relished what he managed to do with the Schutzstaffel (the SS) and the killing machine it became.

There is use of archive footage throughout and some of this is quite disturbing - including scenes of execution. The film often juxtaposes the `we love you daddy' letters with on screen displays of atrocities that he ordered to be carried out and has much more of an impact because of it. This is smiles- heils and lies and is a compelling and disturbing watch; for those that are interested in our history - even a dark episode like this - then there is a lot here to recommend viewing.",1439078400,20,1320,4.432098765432099

8698744,4,B00SKFJH1K,"This is a well produced documentary which is an in depth look at one of the Third Reich and Nazi Party's most known leaders.  Heinrich Himmler has been called a vile human being, a disgusting monster and the evil genius. Yet in this documentary, he is somehow humanized so we can understand the man behind the machine of death and destruction. Clips from archive footage are mixed with the dialogue from his diaries and we gain access to his private life with his wife, daughter and mistress. We hear his dreams and yearnings and have a front row seat at his madness while he justifies the atrocities of the Holocaust and portrays himself as the hero.",1485561600,,651,4.612068965517241
8698745,5,B00SKFJH1K,"(I will reiterate here, and add to, some of the content of a comment I posted after a review that was critical of the footage juxtaposed behind excerpts of Himmler's letters:)  The juxtaposition is beyond ingenial. It is inspired. The irony and dissonance achieved by display of the actual horrors Himmler was engineering as backdrop to his endlessly self-congratulatory and self-pitying banter achieve something unique, in this genre. It is especially rare to see footage of the Volhynian Aktionen, in which Jews and other reviled populations were thrown live into pits, shot, and buried, but such footage (and it's unusually high-quality) appears in this film just when Himmler is reporting his upcoming visits to Rovno, Lodz, etc., where the Aktionen took place. Brilliant in the extreme. Other priceless details include visuals of the gas-emitting death trucks used before gas chambers were installed on a widespread basis. The only other historian I know to have addressed this early killing device very pointedly is Timothy Snyder, possibly history's most insightful chronicler of the Holocaust. A propos Synder (whose scholarship on the lebensraum concept is staggering), the most striking reveal of this amazing film is the extent to which conquest of the East, and the plan to settle Aryans there, guided planning and policy as early as the 1920s.  This aspiration is expressed clearly and in detail even in the words of Himmler's pubescent daughter, throughout the film. I'm now thinking that for those who quest for deep understandings of the Holocaust's origins, there can be no better combination than Snyder's Black Earth and this fantastic video documentary.",1463443200,2,1673,5.309433962264151
8698746,4,B00SKFJH1K,"Himmler's personal letters offer fresh insights into the mind this coldly evil figure, who was the first man in history who took the killing of millions of people to an industrialized level. If you are looking for any ""action film"", this documentary will be too ponderous for you. On the other hand, if you are fascinated with the motivations of those who were among Nazi's inner circle, this will serve an interesting view.",1462406400,4,424,4.821917808219178
8698747,4,B00SKFJH1K,"In 1945, shortly after Heinrich Himmler committed suicide, the US Army found a huge cache of his letters, papers and diaries at his house. Instead of handing them in to the appropriate authorities, they kept them; many of the papers subsequently found their way on to the international auction market.

Vanessa Lapa's documentary tells the story of Himmler's life through these letters and other documents exchanged between Himmler, his parents, his wife Marga and daughter Gudrun. Contrary to what other reviewers have observed about the title's so-called banality, the term THE DECENT ONE refers to a moment late on in the film, when Himmler discovers that the Nazi cause is about to collapse. He insists that he and many of his fellow-officers were decent in their behavior, as they were committed to the patriotic ideal of a greater Germany. We might interpret the term ironically, especially in light of our knowledge about Nazi atrocities, but in Himmler's view the Party always acted according to the noblest motives - for the greater good of the German (i.e. Aryan) people.

The documentary derives much of its power from the contrast between the sentiments exchanged in the letters - where Himmler expresses his love for his daughter and his concern for his family's welfare - and the images projected on screen, such as the burning of so-called ""seditious"" literature in Berlin in 1933, the regular parades of the SS in front of Hitler and Himmler, and the callous shooting of Nazi enemies in cold blood. We understand just how ruthless Himmler and his acolytes actually were, while at the same time realizing just how much their patriotism had corrupted them.

Despite the sentiments expressed in family letters, Himmler was in truth not really concerned about anyone except himself. He embarked on a well-publicized affair with one of his former staffers, by whim he had another child. But this did not stop him proclaiming his commitment to noble ideals such as the propagation of the Aryan race. He forced his family to take on an adopted child, Gerhard, who seldom got on with Gudrun and eventually joined the Nazi army at the earliest possible opportunity. Himmler did not really care; so long as he and his family could be seen to support the noble cause of Nazism, that was all that mattered.

In the end we are left with the sense that Nazism was actually an ideology that so blinded its supporters that they had no real sense of morality; they no longer understood the difference between right and wrong. They could claim quite innocently that they were kind and understanding towards their people, while at the same time embarking on a campaign to systematically exterminate Germany's Jewish population. Himmler's letters, as well as those written by his family, embody this (lack of) morality; to proclaim (as Marga did) that she ""did not know"" about the so-called ""Final Solution"" is no excuse.

This is the true horror of Lapa's documentary; it provides a lesson in the ways in which dictatorships erode human values, not only corrupting those at the apex of power, but the people willingly allowing themselves to be ruled in favor of a cause.",1458864000,6,3167,4.945488721804511
8698748,4,B00SKFJH1K,"Regarding ""The Decent One"" (the DVD), I'm sort of on the fence as whether or not to recommend it. There is certainly new information - in Himmler's own words - but so much is what we've heard before.  What is annoying but not surprising is the juxtaposition of his words in his letters with totally unrelated background videos. An example is how he writes his wife to say he won't be able to make it home for the weekend while in the background the video is stock footage from the Eastern Front used many times before.

Not a bad DVD but it could have been so much better",1453852800,7,571,4.277777777777778
