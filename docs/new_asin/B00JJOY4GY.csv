6361863,5,B00JJOY4GY,"as a long time fan Clue in all forms, I've been chomping at the bit for this release (and had been asking the company for years).

it's a well casted, well acted and a delightful mystery. we are robbed of a true ending and of having any more of the series but it's well worth the watch",1432252800,,285,4.0
6361864,5,B00JJOY4GY,It was a different twist to the original,1431648000,,40,4.125
6361865,5,B00JJOY4GY,"Don't let the cover fool you.  This is a fully updated movie (complete with smart phones and blogs etc).  The only real connection to the game or the older movies is the names.  A group of diverse high school students watches a man being attacked in a hotel window.  Unfortunately for them, the police and school staff do not believe them and they are all suspended (one is fired from his job).  To clear their names and get their lives back on track they find themselves sinking into a deeper and deeper mystery.  The mystery centers around Nikola Tesla and a revolutionary discovery.  The story is very well written and the acting is good.  This was originally a TV series broadcast on the Hub in 2011 but watches like a complete movie.  I had never heard of this before seeing it here, I am glad we purchased it, very high quality mysteries are hard to find.",1412899200,4,861,4.467948717948718
6361866,4,B00JJOY4GY,"Very entertaining movie. Definitely a very enjoyable young persons movie....but I'm not a young person anymore and I was very entertained too! I can't single any of the young performers out because they were all terrific (a couple faces looked familiar to me). In a nutshell, these 6 young people witness what appears to be a murder and when told that there is no evidence of any foul play and they will be suspended from school, they set out to investigate. I will be honest some was very obvious and some were a surprise...just when you think the movie is done another mystery comes from it. Fun, sweet and thoughtful it is a fun time for the family. Clean as a whistle. Love the twin bad guys, haha.",1409011200,6,702,4.4921875

8651325,3,B00JJOY4GY,"While not true to the world and characters of the game, it's nice to see a film even slightly related to the game I love so much. A better title would be Clue Jr though. No offense to juniors, but give me 1985 versionany day",1510099200,,224,4.0
