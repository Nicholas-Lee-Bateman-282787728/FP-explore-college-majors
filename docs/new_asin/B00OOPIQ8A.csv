6758279,4,B00OOPIQ8A,"Im a little confused by the cool critical reception this received on release.  Yes, its uneven at times, and it's slightly distanced emotionally for an epic historical melodrama about one of the terrible genocides of the 20th century. Yes, it occasionally traffics in clichs, and there are some clunky lines and awkward moments of dubbing.

But that is more than offset by spectacular photography, tremendously affecting scenes of horror, loss, sadness, hope, anachronistic but extremely effective music, and an intelligent attempt to deal with not only the Armenian genocide, but what it means to be a refugee, the nature of silence, the complexity of morality in a morally confusing world, and many other themes that raise it above most of the Hollywood historical melodramas we see, including many that win Oscars and are great successes (many of which also traffic in cliches and have some awkward dialogue).  If its not quite as great as the far more personal and quirky films that are the very best of Akins work; Head-On, The Edge of Heaven, Crossing the Bridge , its still a thoughtful and intelligent film by one of the most interesting film-makers in the world today.

It tells the story of an Armenian who is forced to leave his family and perform slave labor after the Ottoman Empire enters the first world war, and follows him into ever worse layers of personal hell.  Rather than trying to capture the scope of the genocide all around him, for a long while we get only hints and glimpses of the horrible larger truth, seeing only what our character does.  Its an intimate experience of genocide.  The second act of the film, once the war is over, is our heros long and winding journey to try and find what might be left of his family.  Not the first time such a subject has been dealt with on film, but this does it with an off-beat and almost dreamlike tone, and a meditative pace.  I found myself thinking of filmmakers like Lisandro Alonso as much as Steven Spielberg.  Its a strong and worthwhile cross between art-house and old school epic melodrama.  If you are willing to forgive the occasional lapse, its very worth seeing.

A note of caution: The German blu-ray, while great looking, does not have English subtitles.  The film is largely, but not completely in English (English stands in for Armenian), but some crucial scenes are in Turkish or Arabic, with no translations offered - a real problem.  On the other hand, the US DVD has the film mostly dubbed into Armenian (which Akin approves of), and completely subtitled in English, which, strangely was more effective in some ways than the English track (and I usually HATE dubbing).  But in this case many of the supporting actors clearly are not native english speakers, and the performances get very stiff and off-putting for it at times.  When I saw the film a second time, in the Armenian dub with all English subtitles, it actually helped a lot of those performances flow better, and I found the film a more affecting experience overall.  However, I wish there was a release that offered both the original English track with subtitles for all other languages (which doesn't seem to exist), AND the Armenian dubbed track with English titles, as on the US DVD. And while I'm at it, I'd like all that on a blu-ray, since this is a beautifully shot film.  Sigh...",1454976000,4,3341,4.760831889081456
6758280,5,B00OOPIQ8A,"This movie was amazing, and a must see. This was an emotional journey and I could think of no one better to play the lead role- Tahar Rahim is an incredible actor.",1454371200,,163,4.125
6758281,5,B00OOPIQ8A,"Fatih Akin does it again. Tahar Rahim is great, the script is engrossing, visually stunning. A true epic in the vain of a modernized Ben-Hur.",1453507200,,141,4.68
6758282,4,B00OOPIQ8A,"Tahar Rahim (A Prophet) stars as Nazarat an Armenian artisan in the town of Mardin. World War I is raging and the Ottoman Turks have thrown in their lot with the forces of Germany and her allies. In Turkey a decision is made to do something about the Christian Armenians. Nazarat is rounded up and forced to work as slave labour  leaving his wife and twin daughters alone to their fate.

What befalls him is horrific and what befell the Armenians was a war crime and a crime against humanity. In the aftermath of his travails Nazarat hears that his daughters have survived the blood bath, he then sets out to find them and the majority of the film is taken up with his search.

Now this is a fairly good effort, it is a bit shameless at tugging on the heart strings though. It was a wide European co-production and that is reflected in the languages being used. The main language though is English, which is used by most of the players here. That may be why it has faced criticism of some of the acting. That criticism is that some of it was a bit hammy or wooden. It is harder to act in a non native tongue so a lot of the nuances are lost.

Rahim is as ever excellent and believable and as a central character to the film he manages to hold it all together very well. There are some plot holes and I could not find if this was based on an actual real story. However, it is fairly engaging and with a run time of around two hours managed to keep me gripped for the most part hence my rating.",1446681600,4,1492,4.188153310104529
8684379,5,B00OOPIQ8A,"This is a real traumatic movie from start to finish........The tragedy that befell on the Ottoman Armenians as the victims of the first Genocide of the 20th century can not be far from the truth in this movie. A brilliant production and a great cast of actors in particular Tahar Rahim's portrayal of a father looking for his lost two daughters ......was sensational!!! You could not immerse yourself in this movie without shedding a few drops of tears.
A must for every movie lover interested in a war drama. Well done.",1524700800,,520,4.725274725274725

8684381,5,B00OOPIQ8A,"This is one of the best movies on the Armenian Genocide. You really understand what the roadlabor work crews were really like, labor death camps.
I just found it odd that the missing daughter was later found in an American western state. I didn't think that the Armenians were settled there.",1495843200,,291,4.7254901960784315
8684382,5,B00OOPIQ8A,"In my opinion, this is one of the best movies on the tragic topic of the Armenian genocide. The director is of Turkish origin and he clearly scored big with his talent and undeniable courage. The eerie soundtrack with its familiar repetitious theme does its job well - maintaining a sense of uneasiness while constantly reminding the audience of the authenticity of the main characters - Armenians from Turkey. The story line is very real and tends to stay relatively neutral as opposed to the few melodramatic and chauvinistic predecessors of this genre. The acting is really superb, but directing and especially the cinematography are genuinely outstanding. This is a haunting movie that you will always remember, no matter who you are or where you stand on the Armenian Genocide.",1494460800,,782,5.023076923076923
8684383,1,B00OOPIQ8A,"I'm a big Akin fan, however this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever watched! Boring and poorly acted. The soundtrack was just horrible! Drone electric guitar, what was he thinking? Skip this movie, and watch Head On!",1489190400,,225,4.512195121951219
8684384,5,B00OOPIQ8A,Very good and well done.,1485820800,,24,4.0
8684385,4,B00OOPIQ8A,"The Armenian genocide has been shrouded in silence for a century. Undertaken in 1915 by the Ottoman Empire, the systematic extermination of the predominantly Christian ethnic group led to 1.5 million deaths.

While the genocide was depicted by Hollywood as early as 1919 in Ravished Armenia, it has largely been ignored by major filmmakers, with the notable exception of Atom Egoyans Ararat (2002).

It was welcome news when one of Europes leading cinematic lights, Turkish German director Fatih Akin (Head On, The Edge of Heaven), decided to tackle the subject with The Cut, a breathtaking 138-minute saga about a man who survives the slaughter only to trek across three continents in search of his daughters.

Filled with a bewildering series of adventures, colorful characters, hair-raising violence, and sublime references to Charlie Chaplins films, The Cut is as uneven as it is exhausting to watch.

Acclaimed Algerian French actor Tahar Rahim (A Prophet, The Past) leads an international cast as Nazaret Manoogian, an Armenian blacksmith who lives in southeast Turkey with his wife, Rakel (Hindi Zahra), and their twins, Arsinee (Zein Fakhoury) and Lucinee (Dina Fakhoury).

Its 1915. Turkey, one of Germanys allies, is hurling itself into the chaos of war. Nazaret, who maintains that the Turks have always treated him well, is conscripted to serve in the military as an unpaid laborer. Beaten, abused and starved, the workers are executed the moment they finish their project.

Miraculously, Nazaret survives. The soldier tasked with cutting his throat  they won't waste bullets on Armenians  only manages to sever his vocal cords.

Reduced to a homeless, penniless refugee who also has been robbed of the power of speech, Nazaret takes to the road to find his family. Like the Stations of the Cross, each stop on his journey takes him deeper into pain and humiliation.

He visits a refugee camp littered with bodies  Armenians were dumped there to starve. There he sees his sister-in-law, who begs him to finish her off.

Later, when he hears his daughters may be alive, Nazaret travels through the Middle East to Cuba and finally America.

The Cut is a film one must experience. Yet it is riddled with problems. It was shot in English and later redubbed by Armenian speakers, which gives the dialogue a stilted feeling. Despite its visual beauty and Rahims extraordinary, and silent, performance, the film never quite manages to connect on an emotional level. The Cut portrays remarkable, gut-wrenching events and touches on issues that remain raw to this day, yet its subject matter seems ill-served by the visual tone, which is strangely distant, dispassionate.",1474588800,,2674,5.162037037037037
8684386,5,B00OOPIQ8A,Beautifully acted and directed film. Some critics have been too harsh in part because they came to this film with preconceptions based upon Akin's previous output.,1470009600,,163,5.3076923076923075
8684387,1,B00OOPIQ8A,"I feel so bad for Fatih Akin. I hated this movie, and I've loved everything else he's done. So the reason I feel bad for him is that the movie's subject is obviously one he feels deeply about and wants to communicate about in an epic way...and he isn't able to. It must be very frustrating. But it makes me feel that he's a more human character, so even if I didn't like the movie I think I learned something interesting about how I react to movies...part of it has to do with the story that's in the movie, and part of it is the story and the vision of the director.",1468800000,,567,4.071428571428571
8684388,5,B00OOPIQ8A,"By now Fatih Akin is well-established as a transnational auteur who has produced award-winning serious dramas that highlight the complexities of life for a new generation of Turkish Germans born in Germany, as well as light-hearted comedies of glocalization. But his 2014 The Cut, the final installment in his Love, Death, and the Devil trilogy, takes his art to a new level in a number of ways. It is his first historical drama, set initially in 1914 Turkey; it introduces a further historicizing element by making the main character mute, so that the resulting work is a hybrid silent film; and it is his most geographically wide-ranging film to date, breaking out of the Euro-Mediterranean region for the first time.
The Cut is based on meticulous research of the Armenian genocide; it had the enthusiastic participation of many Armenians and Armenian Americans (notably Scorseses scriptwriter, Mardik Martin). But this is not a film ""about"" the Armenian genocide, the direct portrayal of which occupies less than half the film (the remainder is devoted to Nazaret Manoogian's search for his twin daughters). It is this ""second half"" of the film that has left some viewers complaining about a lack of plot. But for the attentive viewer, there are many treasures here.
More than a mere historical drama, The Cut is both a morality play of sorts and an homage to Akins cinematic inspirations from Chaplin to John Ford. The obvious moral content concerns the genocide itself, and the film offers multiple please for understanding and forgiveness rather than revenge; in one scene, Nazaret stops with his hand raised to literally throw stones at the now-defeated Ottomans, a clear reference to his own namesake's injunction not to ""cast the first stone."" But film's portrayal of evil (and the devil and theodicy and proper human action) is not confined to the obvious or the horrendous; in this film, small choices end up making all the difference. Watch it carefully and you'll see! The cinematography is beautiful and comes through even on the small screen.
I have not watched the original English version, but instead the Armenian-dubbed version with English subtitles; for me the range of languages in the film is part of its attraction (languages I could identify included Turkish, Arabic, Spanish, and finally, indeed, some very American English).",1465603200,2,2352,5.111688311688312
