5396150,1,B00A7ZHDOO,"Safe Haven, originally a novel written by Nicolas Sparks and released in 2010 under the same name, focuses on Katie (Julianne Hough), the shy, beautiful out-of-towner seeking a small, secluded town where she can hide from her dark, mysterious past.  Immediately, she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), the townie convenient store owner (with two kids and a recently deceased wife), and Jo (Cobie Smulders), her new neighbor from down the street.  After making several trips to the convenient store, Katie bonds with Alexs six year old daughter, Lexie (Mimi Kirkland)  ultimately leading to Alex and Katie spending more time together.  The sparks fly, but it turns out Katie isn't being totally honest with Alex  keeping her abusive husband (David Lyons) thats searching for her from him.  Cue the drama...

Apparently, Hitchcock-style twists and turns are all the rage these days, with Safe Haven being no exception.  While you may initially think this could potentially be the next Notebook, or at least an average love story  its going to disappoint you as it turns out to be so much more, and so much worse.  The acting, the scenery, the cast, the plot  its all overshadowed by the bizarre ending of the film.  The ending depreciates the film so much so that it basically forces you to shake your head, even though you might already be tearing up at the same time.  Yes, its really that mind-boggling and bewildering.

Without a doubt, it would be incredibly easy to just trash this film due largely in part to the ending, except for the fact that this film was mildly tolerable until the climactic twist.  Lets face facts here  Julianne Hough is known for her outstanding voice and dancing ability, while Josh Duhamel looks pretty out of place unless he has a gun in his hand, firing at space aliens made out of automobiles.  Obviously, these aren't your typical star-powered actors and actresses  rather models that act.  Theres very little doubt that these two individuals are stunningly gorgeous as eye candy, but the overall quality of the film is sacrificed because of their limited acting ability.  Midway through the film, its a head-scratcher as to why Cobie Smulders is even in the film, since she has little to do with the plot until the very end of the film.  If this cast was anymore unmemorable and expendable, this film will be a perfect fit as a Lifetime original.  Never the less, this is still a Nicolas Sparks story, so its instantly going to garner a certain amount of attention, not to mention a healthy box office gross.

Overall, this film is terribly generic and to call it anything less is irresponsible.  However, its not so bad that it shouldnt be recommended to the film-goers it was created for  that being women.  Will the film bore guys to death with its lack of substance and slow-moving plot?  Yes, very much so  yet its ironic that the films only saving grace is also the same element that dooms the film:  Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel.

5396151,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"The movie begins in Boston with a young, scared woman running with a bag in her hand.  The police are looking for her.  She gets on a bus headed for Atlanta.  When it makes a stretch stop at the quiet water-front town of Southport, North Carolina, Katie gets out to stretch her legs and just doesn't get back on.  She soon gets a job at Ivan's Fish Shack (local restaurant) but she is obviously hiding from something and/or someone and her fears make her afraid to get close to people, at least at first. While Katie is trying to go on with her new life in the small town, the Boston police, at least one police captain, seems obsessed with finding her.  He obtains tapes of the busses and begins searching.  It's only a matter of time before. . .

Meanwhile, she meets local widower Alex, a really nice guy (and handsome) with two young children.  Alex seems immediately attracted to Katie, and the dance begins.  Of course, as any good movie-viewer knows, whatever Katie is hiding has got to surface, cause that's just the way it is in movieland.

This movie is part drama and part feel-good.  It has thrills, chills, danger, and love.  It is the story about a young woman who overcomes obstacles to become whole again.  Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel had great screen chemistry.  The very very end was soooo cool, too.

I absolutely loved this movie and plan to buy it when it becomes available for my collection.  As a side note, if you liked ""Sleeping With The Enemy"" with Julia Roberts, I believe you will like this movie as well for it's similarities.

BTW--It actually does take place in Southport North Carolina.  I have to put that place on my Bucket List to visit.",1361145600,,1676,4.511627906976744
5396152,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"A romance, yes, but with unusual twists and a complex story line. That is what makes the new film Safe Haven so interesting to watch. February 14 is known as a day for romance, and this year at the theater is no exception. Rated PG-13 for sexual and adult content, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Victoria B recommends this film, even to those who are not fans of the romance genre, because it is ""unique and not cliche.""

Safe Haven
Reviewed by Victoria B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic

Safe Haven is surprisingly eerie for a romantic movie. I have never seen Julianne Hough play such an intense role before, and she is honest in her acting. She plays a distrusting woman in a new town looking to have no neighbors, friends or any emotional ties, but she forgets that southerners are strangely friendly. Her goal becomes more difficult.

I love the style in which the movie is shot, flashing between the present to the past.  This movie follows a woman named Katie who runs away from home and from her husband who is stalking her. She takes a bus, in a disguise, to any town. When the bus stops for a pit stop, she decides that the sleepy and quaint little town she has stopped in is the one for her.

Katie (Julianne Hough) has to start over with a new name, house and people.  First she gets a job at a local seafood shack and buys a new house. She stops at the local store for groceries and meets a charming little girl named Lexi (Mimi Kirkland), followed by her dad, Alex (Josh Duhamel), who coincidentally is the same guy that sold her coffee the first day in town. Neither of them at first admit it, but it is clear that there is an instant attraction. From then on, whenever Katie goes to the store she sees Lexie and meets her brother Josh (Noah Lomax) and flirts with Alex.  Katie tells all of her encounters with Alex to her one neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders), and Jo encourages the idea of Katie dating Alex. The closer Alex and Katie get, the more dangerous their relationship becomes.

There is a twist when Alex, who is friends with the sheriff, sees a wanted for murder post with Katie's face on it. He confronts her and tells her to leave. To find out what happens next, you'll have to see it for yourself.

I give this movie five out of five stars because this romantic movie is unique and not clich. I recommend it for ages 13 and up or mature audiences, due to the sexual scenes and scenes of domestic and substance abuse. I am not a fan of romantic movies, but this one was the best I have seen. It even has an exciting twist that I never saw coming. I love this movie and will see it again.

5396153,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"""Katie"", a girl escaping from her violent past, hides away in a small seaside village where she meets Alex and his two children who are trying to get over his wife's death from cancer.  Katie immediately connects with them, and also a girl who is her neighbour in the community.  She gets a waitress job and buys a rustic cabin away from the village.  There she is able to re-evaluate what is important and discover a safe haven away from her troubled life.

As usual Nicholas Sparks does not disappoint and I quite enjoyed this latest offering about second chances.  First of all it is a beautiful love story and the romantic chemistry between Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel is very intense.  It is also a suspenseful thriller and I will try not to spoil it for anyone by telling too much as the whole point of a thriller is that you don't know what happens, lol. I do find the film a bit slow in places which balance out the suspenseful and violent parts of the story which at times are hard to watch. Setting the mood with beautiful scenery and touching moments really adds to the development of the love story, which you feel like you are living yourself.  The acting is very good and also David Lyons does an excellent job of playing the cop turned bad who is stalking her.

There is very little swearing in this movie but there is a bit of vulgar language as well as two uses of ""For C's Sake"". Also, the fact that the main characters engage in sex outside the marriage relationship will be offensive to some.  As a Catholic Christian, Nicholas Sparks often puts a Christian symbol in his stories, but I did not notice that this time.  I haven't read the book, but I gather the antagonist in the book quotes scripture a lot, based on the discussion questions at the back of movie edition version of the novel.  However, this is not something I noticed while watching the movie.

I would recommend this film, despite its imperfections.  I feel the symbolism of the desk is that true love stands the test of time and will last forever.  That's really what this movie is about...finding true love and getting a second chance at life.",1360972800,5,2137,4.488372093023256
5396154,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"Folks, don't think for a second that Romeo and Juliet or even that medieval times rip-off called Tristan and Isolde is a great romance tale!! Nothing except for poppycock made by none other than the great genius of romance (or GGOR) himself, Nicky Sparks, can be considered anything close to what TRUE romance really is!

It follows then that Safe Haven is the greatest work of art depicting true romance since Lady and the Tramp (now available on VHS and laser disc)! When I saw this early in the morning today, on Valentine's Day, I clutched the hand of my lover with more passion, desperation and tenderness than I ever have before. The reason for this effusive outburst of affection on my part obviously had to do with the high caliber of acting from the two leads, Joshie Duhamel and Julianne Huff, both of whom should be awarded the extremely prestigious Blockbuster Entertainment Awards for 2013!

The story is highly original and not sappy at all because this is a Nicky Sparks story, and we all know that Nicky Sparks is the most thought-provoking and ultra-serious author on Earth...ever. Huff plays a prostitute who has become fed up with love because all the men she dates just want her for sex, even though she just doesn't know why!! Joshie, though, is the handsome john who sees through all her hooking and sees her for what she really is: A kind-hearted sex worker with a heart of gold and a penchant for voting Democrat. A match made in Heaven shortly follows.
Since this is a highly original and brainy movie, the climax comes when it's discovered that Huff's in a pinch that only Joshie can save her from. It turns out that her p/i/m/p wants to get back from her the Carl Jr.'s coupon that she stole from him, and he'll stop at nothing to get that deal that will get him a free Coke, free burger and free fries (with the purchase of a 10-piece chicken bucket, of course)!!

I won't give away any spoilers, but let's just say that Joshie ends up saving Huff from her mean old p/i/m/p by explaining to him that Burger King offers better meal deals anyway, and that, therefore, he didn't need or want the Carl Jr.'s coupon anywho! The day is saved, as the p/i/m/p (turns out to be an Obama voter) leaves, thereby proving that Joshie saved the day! As his reward, Joshie gets sweet, sweet intercourse from Huff, which lasts for exactly 15, maybe 16 seconds. While watching that tender, tender love scene of passion, I'm not ashamed to admit that I experienced a lust emission myself.

In short, please celebrate Valentine's Day the right way by enriching all the chocolate companies, greeting card companies and flower shops (all three entities invented the contrived holiday, by the way) with your hard-earned money. Then, snuggle close to your lover and watch Safe Haven until you become hungry and need to go to Carl Jr.'s for some TLC.",1360800000,4,2854,4.645544554455445
5396155,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"If you can endure the schmaltz (or if you're like me and honestly _like_ schmaltz), this is a lovely romance (released on Valentine's Day 2013) about a young woman with a ""deep dark secret"" who finds herself seeking to rebuild her life in a sleepy little town who meets a young widower with two small kids who's trying to rebuild his life as well.  It's Hollywood, so it all has to end well.  But it's actually a pretty good ride evoking films ranging from Cape Fear, Sucker Punch to the tear-jerker Ghost ;-)",1360800000,,509,4.462365591397849
5396156,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"I guess I'd call this a PG-13 romance with an edge. We have attractive leads, mysterious pasts and dark secrets..... The book on which this is based is by Nicholas Sparks (""The Notebook"") so it MUST be romantic, right? And there has to be an idyllic boat ride on a bayou...and two lovers caught in the rain. The movie is directed by Lasse Halstrm (""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"") so it will feel like real people in a real situation, with humorous bits tossed in just for fun. As you can tell, this is actually pretty good because we have plenty of people to root for.

We watch:
  * Josh Duhamel (""Transformers,"" ""New Year's Eve"" and lots of TV) as Alex, a widower of two years, helping his two youngsters cope with their loss and helping his uncle run a little grocery store/gas station/tackle shop in a North Carolina fishing village. BTW, this actor is really good with children!
  * Noah Lomax (Lots of TV) is Josh, his older child who remembers, and still misses, his mom.
  * Mimi Kirkland in her first movie role, is Lexie, the younger child who only remembers the idea of her mother. She's a precocious, loyal little busybody.
  * Julianne Hough (""Rock of Ages"" and ""Footloose"") is Katie, fleeing for her life from Boston and trying to find a safe haven beyond the reach of her pursuer.
  * Cobie Smulders (""The Avengers"") is Jo, the lovely neighbor who befriends our heroine.
  * David Lyons (Lots of TV) is either a cop, an abandoned husband, or both.

There are plenty of other characters, but time does not permit... I could have done without some of the bucolic photography, but it was only 115 minutes. Suffice it to say, this had no profanity and some chaste love making, but had a real nail-biter of a climax and a totally unexpected twist...plus Duhamel is VERY easy on the eye! When I get the DVD from Amazon, I can back it up a time or two...smile...",1360713600,,1869,4.491124260355029
5396157,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"I'm not so sure you should classify this as a chick flick, even though there seemed to be a lot more females than males at the screening I attended. For me there were enough non-romance scenes to make it a more of a mystery. I can't say a lot about the plot without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it.

The movie runs the course of your basic romance with an unlikely couple who meet and fall for each other in spite of their problems until their relationship takes a major hit due to revelations about a secret past. In fact, threaded throughout the story are short scenes involving a Boston cop obsessed with finding a suspect in an attempted murder. There are a few tense moments of violence and absolute terror, but it's not gratuitous or over done, only enough to reveal the mystery and lead to a satisfying conclusion, (or not). What I liked the most was that, just when I thought the plot had taken its final twist, a letter is opened and read which surprised me all over again.

I enjoyed this movie much more than The Notebook, another movie based on a novel by the same author, Nicholas Sparks. I felt this was more action packed, exciting and optimistic that The Notebook. I also felt the cast was strong, from the leading characters to the supporting actors. All in all, an entertaining movie that I would recommend.",1359936000,135,1335,4.489711934156379

A story of healing and redemption set in the small water-swept neighborly coastline of South Port, North Carolina. Stunning visuals move the story along with the grace and glow of Southern Hospitality at its best. Story author Nicholas Sparks knows and shares his characters with affection.

Director Lasse Hallstrom , holds a steady rein on this romantic drama, digging us deeper into each character with a deft gentle touch. Wonderful casting with Julianne Hough playing a running-from-her-past waitress and Josh Duhamel as the small-town lonely widower. The romantic chemistry here is beyond hot. It's incendiary.

The DP sure know how to light these actors. Great visuals of consoling rustic evening sunsets, followed by ever-hopeful morning ocean sunrises. Scenes dance along with clever editing, moving this compelling adventure forward like a seasoned Olympic ice skater, gliding on her home-town ice.

Will encourage all my SAG acting friends to watch this work of art. This work of the heart. Missing some movie magic in your life? Here it is.

Hey, I know this actress can dance, from Dancing with the Stars show, but I was totally surprised the young woman can act too! She did great! As did the woman who played her friend. The guys were alright, but the women outshined them. Sorry! Okay, I think that's because it is pretty much a girl movie. Something I was surprised about was, that it has a spiritual aspect to it. I didn't get it, until the end. Didn't see it coming! It's a hidden thing. So, I loved the spirituality of it too. You'll know what I mean if you rent it or buy it. But, even so, it does a spiritual thing, without being at all a movie of religion or faith! It is a movie about ""hope"", and it is well done. You'll enjoy it! But, be prepared, it is a little long.

Not a super deep plot as you can kind of guess what will happen from scene to scene, although I have to say the ending was not expected so that made it even more of a chick flick as the tears start to flow.  I mostly watched it because of Julianne Hough as I really like her.",1470787200,,374,3.675

5396705,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"Safe Haven is one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks movies, if not THE favorite one. Katie is running from a recent event that could change her life and ends up in a small North Carolina town. She tries to keep to herself, but, finds an undeniable attraction to a small store owner named Alex who is a widow with two young children. Through all of this shes befriended by a warm-natured woman and they have several conversations where everything seems to click.

As the romantic relationship builds with Alex, Katies past begins to catch up with her. Safe Haven is a perfect date night movie. Its romantic yet edgy complete with the heartfelt surprises that Nicholas Sparks is so famous for.",1470182400,,688,4.68595041322314

5397013,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"After reading the book recently I wanted to watch the movie again.  There are so many differences between the book and the movie, I mean besides the name and the very basic premise, you wouldn't realize that they're even supposed to be the same thing.  The movie moves at a much faster pace than the book, following more of the rom-com insta-love route, the characters are very different, Katie is portrayed as much more out going and not afraid of anything, she didn't feel like a woman trying to get away from her abusive husband, she just feels like she could be anybody just starting over.  The thriller elements were weak at best, Kevin the crazy ex-husband is just a watered down version of himself, and not really that scary.  With so many changes this movie is not that good and I don't think it does the book justice, it's just not for me.",1457827200,,848,4.487012987012987

5397403,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"On a dark, rain-swept night, a young woman named Katie flees from her suburban home and into the arms of a generous neighbor. A few hours later, Katie is boarding a bus headed out of town while a police detective scurries to find her before she can make good her escape. He fails, and soon Katie is headed south, on her way to what she hopes will be a new life. But the past is never far behind and secrets have a way of coming out. Is there a safe haven anywhere in the world for Katie?

Adapted from a novel by bestselling writer Nicholas Sparks, SAFE HAVEN is a story of trust, redemption, and of course, love. The script, which is for the most part well-crafted and deserved credit for avoiding a number of the clichs that often taint romantic dramas, does a good job of establishing a credible cast of characters, especially Katie. Julianne Hough plays the role of the runaway woman with sincerity and passion, and her performance keeps the story grounded. Josh Duhamel is also excellent as Josh, a single father with two small children who is struggling to keep his life together in the wake of his beloved wife's death. Josh is clearly attracted to Katie from their first meeting, but Katie is reluctant to return his attentions. There is a good reason for her initial reticence, though like Josh the viewer remains in the dark early on.

The truth is only slowly revealed, much of it in flashbacks from Katie's nightmares, but meanwhile the cop from the opening scene tirelessly works to pick up her trail. David Lyons is great as the crusading detective, consumed by an almost unnatural passion to find Katie and bring her in. He, too, has secrets. Going into more of the plot would be a disservice.

Despite the straightforward nature of the storyline, there are a number of clever twists and it takes a while for all the characters' backstories to play out. Seeing the numerous plot threads unravel at their own pace and savoring the unexpected turns is a big part of what makes SAFE HAVEN more than your usual romance.

SAFE HAVEN is a terrific date movie. It is first and foremost a love story, but the film treats the subject with more respect than your typical teenage drama. The characters are mostly adults and the themes they must wrestle with are serious ones with no easy answers. In the end, the story affirms the value of trust, home, and family, and that those things are worth fighting for even if it means facing up to your worst fear.",1438128000,,2460,4.5588235294117645

5397529,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"Safe Haven is a romantic film that features Julianne Hough, Josh Duhamel and Cobie Smulders. It was directed by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m and based on Nicholas Sparks's novel of the same title.

A young woman flees her house after being shown in possession of a bloody knife. She is shown moments later buying a bus ticket, her hair now cropped and bleached, and stops at a small North Carolina town called Southport. At the general store, she introduces herself as Katie. After acquiring a job as a waitress and buying a small house on the edge of town, Katie becomes friends with her neighbor, Jo and meets handsome Alex Wheatley,the manager of a local convenience store, and his two children, Lexie and Josh. Incidentally,Alex's wife tragically died of cancer a few years prior.

Boasting some picturesque locations and a ludicrously attractive leading couple, Safe Haven should make for a serviceable teen date movie and people who love romantic films. Also,it is both bland and predictable. What is original about it is that it provides spiritual endorsement from an unlikely spiritual being plays cupid to broken individuals.",1433721600,,1126,5.081081081081081

The two main characters are attractive (naturally!), and make a nice blend--despite the age difference (which didn't bother me at all). They have good chemistry. The two kids were the only annoyances, but I suppose they had to be there for tension and the storyline. All in all, I liked it--a good ""chick flick"".",1433548800,,424,4.821917808219178

It lacked character development throughout. I really disliked the ending. I won't give it away but the ending was really what did it in for me.

There were a few differences that I wish would have just been left alone (i.e. some events to the storyline, and the little boys behavior). They did change the little girls name, which honestly isn't a bad idea. When I read the book the main character and the little girl both started with the letter ""K."" I'm sure they did this to help the viewers keep the names straight. I also thought the husband wasn't crazy enough, but it wasn't my favorite aspect in the movie anyway, so I'm not that concerned. I do think as well that some people might have been confused in the first 30 minutes if they hadn't read the book. But then again, when is Nicholas Sparks story lines ever clean cut from the beginning? They aren't! :) I loved it! 5 stars, only a few typical complaints, but I don't care.

5397630,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"I didn't expect much more than a Lifetime movie, but after reading some reviews decided it was worth the risk. I am very glad I made the purchase.  I don't think it can completely be categorized as a chick flick. There is a little bit of an unusual plot that involves both suspense and romance. There was actually enough to the plot that made it stay with me for a while. I believe it also took the critics and general public by surprise. It's much better than a television movie of the week, and I could easily recommend it for a date night at home.",1430524800,,550,4.238095238095238

5397689,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"I love everything about this movie. I love the soundtrack. I love the casting and acting. Julianne Hough's portrayal of the smart woman trapped in an abusive relationship was spot on, from the stoic mask she assumes during the scene with her drunk husband to the subtle portrayal of the slow-melting distrust of everyone else. Josh Duhamel delivers an, as usual, understated, natural performance. I love the sleepy little town, the real life beach town clothes, and especially the direction by genius Lasse Hallstrom. Not a Nicholas Sparks fan, but Lasse Hallstrom turned this into a movie that I truly connected with.",1429056000,,618,5.068627450980392

I realize it is difficult to condense an author's work of months into a 2-hour production, but following the story line is essential. Nicholas Spark produced the movie and wrote the book, so I expected more adherence to the theme of ""Katie""'s escape from a brutal marriage, Kevin's mental deterioration, and the eventual blooming of new love. The movie made Katie's character a rather ditzy, provocatively dressed, kid instead of the emotionally scarred young woman who found it difficult to open up herself to the possibility of trusting again. Another Hollywood ""travesty"" from a truly meaningful book.",1426291200,,681,5.256880733944954

A woman on the run from a detective, lands in Southport, North Carolina, where she meets a handsome widower and his kids, and must ultimately confront her past.

What did I think?

The marketing of this film trumpets its connection to much-loved films The Notebook (same writer) and Cider House Rules (same director). Sadly, this makes Safe Haven seem even worse than it already is, simply by comparison. Sound performances by Josh Duhamel and Julianne Hough  are marred by dull dialogue, a painful pace and a score that flips jarringly from overly dramatic pieces to cheesy country, making the film feel disjointed. A twist in the middle helps ramp up the momentum, but the second twist at the end is odd and unnecessary. All this, combined with laughable over-acting by David Lyons as the detective, leaves Safe Haven in midday-movie territory.",1423958400,3,863,4.972222222222222

5397803,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"No surprises, the storyline is far-fetched and the situation is romanticized to the point that theres no way youll enjoy this if you try to take any of it seriously.  But if you squint pass the embarrassingly bad plot line and just concentrate on the love story, its an easy and pleasant couple hours of escapism.  Josh Duhamel and Julianne Hough are both charming and attractive, and if you are looking for a bit of magnetic connection, they do not disappoint.  The ending is disappointingly (and unnecessarily) over the top; as forgiving as I was willing to be about the rest of the story, Im still in disbelief at the ridiculousness with they wrapped the story up.  But a decently-written romance is hard to come by, so this one fits the bill when the bar is low.",1423353600,,766,4.569343065693431

I love how instead of the usual Sparks chick flick you are given an intense thriller with twists and turns. Julianne Hough does an amazing job in one of her first film starring roles and come on, it co-stars Josh Duhamel. You can't go wrong with eye candy like that! This movie is the perfect date movie as you can satisfy the romance lover and the thrill lover!

If you've ever been fortunate enough to spend some time in Southport, NC, you'll likely enjoy the movie even more.  Much of it was filmed on Southport's waterfront area.  The scenery in this film is gorgeous.  You'll definitely want to watch the blu-ray of this one.

The plot is interesting throughout and the acting is top notch as well.  Elvis fans will appreciate the small role played by Red West.

LOVED this movie.  The actress that plays the little daughter is really adorable, too.  Watch this movie!",1413331200,,281,4.52
5397933,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"Written by Nicolas Sparks (The Notebook), Safe Haven is a story about a woman running from her past, heading into an unknown future.

That Katie (Julianne Hough) is in trouble is clear. The story opens with her doing everything she can to escape into the night with a cop (David Lyons) hot on her trail. Through brief flashbacks, we see that Katie has cut her hair short and lightened it from brown to blonde to disguise herself. We also see that whatever she is running from, it involved a bloody knife in her hand. She is clearly terrified, afraid of getting caught, and relieved when the bus she boards drives safely away, heading to Atlanta, Georgia.

Katie lands in the beautiful and sleepy little fishing village of Southport, North Carolina and it seems like the perfect place to hide. She gets a cabin on the outskirts of town, isolated in the woods. Whenever she is around the people in the town, she is cautious and watchful, even after landing a job in a local restaurant. When the police come in one day, Katie quickly hides - until she realizes they aren't looking for her, only for their carry-out lunch order.

The first person that Katie truly begins to let her guard down with is Lexie (played by the adorable Mimi Kirkland), the young daughter of the man who owns the local store. Lexie might be small, but she is smart and capable and completely steals the show in every scene she is in. Katie soon learns that Lexie's father, Alex (Josh Duhamel) is a widower, whose wife died of cancer. He also has a son, Josh (Noah Lomax), a sad and angry young man who was old enough to remember his mother and misses her very much.

Despite her desire to keep to herself as much as possible, Katie makes a friend, a lovely and charming woman named Jo who chooses to live on the outskirts of town too, for her own personal reasons. They seem to sense that they are kindred spirits and form a bond, and Jo is the first person Katie allows into her home - the first person she truly begins to open up to. Jo encourages Katie to relax into her new life and is supportive when it becomes apparent that there is a relationship slowly blossoming between she and Alex.

But the cop that she was running from persists in his search for her. He manages to narrow down the area she might be in and sends out notices to all the police stations, letting them know that she is wanted in connection with first degree murder. The notice is hung on the bulletin board in the local precinct but the cops don't pay much attention. Unfortunately, Alex does see it, and angrily confronts Katie. He tells her that he can't believe anything she says and suggests that she get out of town right away. It appears that Katie's past has caught up with her after all, but where will she go from here?

I will admit that I was surprised by this movie. I had certain expectations based on the previews I had seen. I knew Josh was a widower and I knew Katie had a mysterious past. Going into it, I really didn't know if she had killed someone in self-defense or if the man she was running from was actually the cop that was chasing her. I was pretty certain that it was a ""battered wife trying for a new life"" kind of story, though.

But there was so much more to this lovely movie. The performances were wonderful and the characters were endearing and easy to care about. I really felt for the people involved, and I particularly wanted to just steal that little girl away and adopt her for my own. There were some lovely twists and turns, genuine edge-of-your-seat thrills, and moments that touched me and made me cry. I expected to like the movie. I did not necessarily expect to love it - but I did.

Keep a box of tissues handy for this one. You'll thank me later.",1413158400,,3745,4.401734104046243

Blending families is very difficult and if two people can blend families together and set that spike and lay the foundation that the love between the mom and dad is the most important aspect of the family then a blended family can succeed.

5398116,5,B00A7ZHDOO,I love the lead actor. He is fantastic. I like the depth of the story. It is not just a simple romance. There is depth and soul to the characters. I love all movies that are made from Nicholas Sparks books. This is no exception. There is some mild violence in the form of a domestic sort but it is essential to the story. Deep and heart felt.,1402444800,,342,4.044117647058823
5398117,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"This is your classic chick flick. It was an ok movie, nothing really to make it stand out. If you enjoy love stories with a little bit of cheese, this is your movie.",1402272000,,165,4.03030303030303
5398118,1,B00A7ZHDOO,This movie is a VERY similar to Sleeping With The Enemy except that movie is so much better than this waste of money.  This is nothing more than a LifeTime channel movie with the worst lead actress ever.  Julianna Hough ruining this movie with her bad acting and should stick to dancing and leave the acting to the stars.  She may be beautiful to look at but her acting is unconvincing........horrible frankly.  The only thing that got me through this 1.5 hour waste of my life is the beautiful scenery which includes the very handsome Josh Duhamel.  Do yourself a favor and rent Sleeping with the Enemy.  It's the same storyline except in this movie the new boyfriend (safe haven) has 2 children and s a widower who's dead wife appears in the movie as a ghost.,1402185600,2,761,4.518248175182482
5398119,4,B00A7ZHDOO,Somewhat predictable plot that took a twist and surprised me at the end. I like it when a movie does that. Enjoyable ensemble of actors that keep you collude to the screen always.,1401926400,,179,4.454545454545454

5398145,2,B00A7ZHDOO,"While I am a huge fan of Julianne Hough, and thought she did a good acting job, this movie was not the best. While I haven't read the book and didn't know what to expect as far as the plot was concerned, I found it to be anti-climatic. Every scene was silly, and I couldn't understand the character development, or what was drawing the love interests together besides sex appeal. The only thing that kept it interesting was the visual attractiveness of the actors. Though, I suppose that's what the directors were going for? Also, Nicholas Sparks stories are stupidly dramatic and highly predictable. There are no men who behave the way his characters do in real life. And if there were, they'd be stupid, and annoying.",1398902400,,719,4.669291338582677

5398147,2,B00A7ZHDOO,SPOILERS (maybe)  this movie was super cute and then like all of a sudden it turned about 3/4 into it to being really weird.  there's a twist ending that was not addressed and now I think Julianna Hough's character might be crazy.,1398384000,,230,4.4523809523809526

5398165,5,B00A7ZHDOO,This is a terrific story and so well acted by all the participants.  I really enjoyed it; it was a mystery with tension as well as a love story.  The scenery was also beautiful - who would not want to live there!  Highly recommended.,1396137600,,233,4.25

Kind of a Hallmark type of story, but if you know that going in, you'll like it. Story had intrigue, secrets, mystery, and of course romance.

Reminds me of a young Meg Ryan with the sweet smile and choppy haircut.  Josh is always great.  The big downfall is the storyline being so slow and confusing at times, I actually went to sleep the first time I tried to watch it and was going to give it 1 star.  Watched it again the next day and it was better, up to 3 stars.  I loved the book and was disappointed there wasn't more substance in the film, it lost the opportunity to be a GREAT movie.

The actors are capable of depth, but the writers didn't offer the opportunity.  I'm not sure why Sparks would even want his name associated with a movie that so poorly depicts his writing.  The Notebook had depth, different screen writers and plenty of depth.  I forced myself to watch the entire movie if for no other reason than pure hope that someone or something would give way to portraying something similar to what the book offered.  Safe Haven is not Sparks best book, but this movie is simply cheesy, rushed, and the storyline was forced into an almost unnatural path.",1390003200,,737,4.7637795275590555

5398256,4,B00A7ZHDOO,This film is not a complete epic and there are several goofs that make it hard to follow in places but that is for a reason.

This is a really sweet story with a heck of alot of twists and turns that take the viewer by surprise. Just when you think you have it figured out... nope! Something kicks ya in the pants in a very cool way lol. I will not spoil it but it has everything I like in an ending though maybe a bit bittersweet - and it ties up nicely. Shawshank Redemption has always been my favorite movie ending but idk... this might just outrank it for me. There is something here for most, mystery, suspense, scary moments and of course, a good dose of romance. Love it!",1388361600,,710,4.227941176470588

I enjoyed the book much better. In the movie, they changed Alex's daughter's name to ""Lexie"" instead of Kristen. Many details were left out, which is expected in a movie that is based on a book.

It is not going to win an award but the acting makes the well worn story line kinda sparkle.  I liked it and think most of you will, at the least the women.  I guess I liked it because it makes it look like there are still good guys out there.",1386633600,,400,3.975

5398273,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"With a minor SPOILER ALERT here, the movie could have been so much better if not for the final few minutes where we get a huge reveal that simply doesn't make sense.  If you disagree, I'd love to hear more in the comments section.  Before the final few minutes I'd have given this one a 5-star rating.

Beyond that I thought Safe Haven was a nice mix of a sweet romantic story and thriller.  The story follows the relationship between Katie, played by Julianne Hough as a young woman who is on the run from an abusive husband and the law, and Alex, played by Josh Duhamel as the widowed father of two young kids that runs the little general store in the sleepy little town.  They face obstacles with his children, with her not wanting to jump into a relationship and then with the fact that her picture shows up on the ""wanted"" board at the police station.

The acting overall is pretty solid and the look of the film is amazing with great scenery and cinematography.  If you like romance stories where you have to suspend reality to get through them then you'll love this movie.  Let me know what you thought about the ending!",1386547200,,1127,4.4106280193236715

5398286,5,B00A7ZHDOO,A Nicholas Sparks story. There really is nothing else to say. It was a beautiful love story. I loved the movie.,1386028800,,111,4.333333333333333
5398287,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"Julianne Hough is Katie, a young woman on the run from her past. Katie boards an Atlanta-bound bus, and gets off impulsively at Southport, a beautiful coastal town in North Caroline. There she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), kind-hearted manager of a grocery store, and starts a new life. Little does she know, however, that her past is slowly catching up with her in the form of a Boston police detective (David Lyons), who seems to know something about her.

Safe Haven is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, which may tell you a few things about the film. Directed by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m (who also helmed a Nicholas Sparks romance Dear John a few years ago), Safe Haven is not surprisingly very romantic, but his new film does not stop there.

For Safe Haven attempts to be a mystery  in more than one sense in this case. There are a few surprises in the story, but they are just a little less impactful than they could have been, as the story is told with little to no build up or nuance. Several supporting characters, Katies neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders) for example, could have been more intriguing with a few clues as to why she gets interested in Katie.

The film is overlong and its mid-section drags, but the film is not boring for the most part of it. After all this is a Nicholas Sparks tale and he sure knows how to spin a romantic tale.",1385856000,,1340,4.502057613168724

It was kind've irritating that they changed the name of one of the characters from the book to the movie but thats pretty much my only complaint! This is one of my favorite books and movies and usually people aren't a fan of both. Its awesome. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!  PLUS.. Josh duhamel (spelling?) is GORGEOUS!!!!  aaahhh..

Really depicted the insanity of jealousy and the obsession that these sick, toxic relationships are like and the damage it inflicts on the victims that are innocent and yet trapped until they reach a breaking point.
""Battered wives syndrome"" shown perfectly and the message of escape and moving on, no matter what the future has in store for the
people that are in these situations.
Nicholas Sparks involved himself in this movie and it came out perfectly, as he did write the book.

My taste kind of veers toward ""Spiderman"" and hers doesn't so sometimes a compromise on my part is in order.  This week we watched this product of chickmeister Nicholas Sparks.  Naturally I went into it with a slight sense of dread.  I've never read a Sparks book or seen a movie adaptation so ""Safe Haven"" was an initiation of sorts for me.  My impressions are the people are pretty.  The kids are cute.  Easy on the eyes Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel have good romantic chemistry.  The North Carolina coastal scenery was nice to look at.  Plot wise this film struck me as a reimagining of ""Sleeping With The Enemy"" as informed by M. Night Shyamalan.  This isn't entirely a bad thing because Shyamalan hasn't been Shyamalan for at least ten years.  This is a film that defies criticism.  Released to coincide with Valentine's Day this is an old fashioned date movie nothing more or less.  Next week my wife and I will watch ""X-Men"".",1383955200,2,1072,4.463917525773196

Josh Duhamel is handsome and sweet in all the right places, definitely a big part of the ""great scenery"" that makes this worth watching, if you are lying on the couch recovering from outpatient surgery, as I am.

Don't listen to those complaining saying it was nothing like the book. I read the book and it was about 80% same as the book and that's a lot. Most movies based on books are so altered. This one was only slightly altered and I liked that because after you read a book, you don't want the movie to be exactly like it because then it won't be as enjoyable because it would be way too predictable! And those saying it was Sleeping with the Enemy...no it wasn't! This one was a beautiful love story, Sleeping with the Enemy was just okay.

Katie is on the run and looking for a safe place. Alex is just trying to do the best for his family. Neither one is looking for anything more but somehow stumble upon each other. This is not a typical love story. You have suspense and intrigue along with a twist in the end that leaves you feeling that everyone does deserve a second chance. I have highly recommended this movie as well as the book to my friends--even the ones who thought it was going to be just another love story and found out it wasn't. Pull up a chair, pop in the movie and, when it's over, be prepared to look at things with a different perspective. People are brought into our lives for a reason.",1379721600,,828,4.246835443037975
5398429,2,B00A7ZHDOO,"If you've seen the Julia Roberts movie ""Sleeping with the Enemy,"" feel free to pass on ""Safe Haven."" It's the same story, with a few slight modifications to make it a bit more romantic. Ultimately, however, Julia Roberts is a much better actress than Julianne Hough, and that's where this movie fails.

Hough is Katie, a severely abused Boston housewife who flees from her violent alcoholic husband and tries to start a new life in Southport, North Carolina. There she meets a widower shopkeeper, Alex (Josh Duhamel) and gradually learns to love again. But Katie knows her husband will never stop searching for her, and his actions during his manhunt let us know that he'll stop at nothing to get her back.

I can't say I hated this movie. Josh Duhamel puts in a decent performance and Cobie Smulders, as Katie's next door neighbor Jo, is immensely likable, the kind of girl you'd want to have for a BFF. The child actors who play Duhamel's kids are terrific. But Julianne Hough did not deliver in her role, and I'm beginning to question if she has the skills necessary to establish a long-term acting career. She's been riding on the coattails of her Dancing with the Stars fame for far too long. There were scenes in this movie that required genuine emotion. Katie was supposed to be crumbling, coming apart at the seams, and Hough couldn't even summon up any tears for her delivery. I hate to say it because I've been rooting for her, but Julianne Hough is just not that talented an actress.

Some of the creative decisions in this film were eyeroll-inducing, as well. Katie supposedly fled from her home in the middle of the night, spur of the moment after a fight with her husband. She hurriedly cuts her hair and apparently also bleaches it to avoid being recognized. How does that work, exactly? She was running for her life but she took the time to bleach her hair (not dye it darker, which would have been faster and easier) and she ended up with perfect blonde locks with strategically-placed highlights. Really? Are we supposed to buy that?

The big problem that stood out for me- and be warned, this is a minor spoiler- was that I could not figure out how her husband went from lying unconscious and stabbed on their dining room floor to suddenly chasing Katie down as she attempts to flee their town on a bus. I did read the book after watching this movie and discovered that Katie actually fled twice- once to another town to work for just a couple of weeks and get some cash, and once to Southport after her husband found her in the first town. So I'm assuming the fleeing-by-bus scene we saw in the movie happened a few weeks after she first left, but I never would have known that if I hadn't read the book. The movie's story seems poorly cobbled together from the general idea. And switching the hair color to match Hough's natural hair was a terrible idea.

Like I said, this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not one I'd recommend. If you have the choice, watch ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" instead. It's a much better version of the tale.",1379548800,2,3069,4.562613430127041
5398430,5,B00A7ZHDOO,Highly recommended.  The acting is good andt he suspense enough to keep you interested.  A little slow moving but endurable.  It's the story of a woman running from an abusive husband (who happens to be a cop).,1379548800,,210,4.621621621621622

Because this was a poor replica of a Julia Roberts classic and an M. Knight Shamylan classic.

Spoiler Alert: this movie = Sleeping with the Enemy (mostly) + The Sixth Sense. Period. I know it's hard to be original, but this is 10% original at best. For example, instead of the Carnival Scene at the school in SWE, Safe Haven has the 4th of July Parade.

Sleeping with the Enemy is much better and hard to replicate or top.  Josh Duhamel is very good looking so that made up for it; lots of shirt-off scenes, yep. Made it worth it.",1379376000,,627,4.122950819672131

Good lead actors, good cinematography, excellent location, decent story.  The best way to describe it was that it simply lacked substance.  It was like an old, lazy Lifetime TV movie.  Nothing exciting.  And because of that, it was extremely slow.  Particularly the first 30 minutes and then again in the middle of the film.  The plot was just too weak for me.  Also there were no good support roles (because the plot was so weak), so it was just lacking any sort of flow.  I think that hurt the film dramatically, just not enough happening to engage the viewer.  And some of the scenes just didn't flow well, and weren't done at the appropriate times, particularly when they kept cutting back to the drunken husband.  Personally if it's a rainy, cold day and you have nothing to do, you MIGHT want to watch this.  Otherwise, there are much better films to watch.  Disappointment.",1379030400,6,1040,4.60655737704918

5398516,5,B00A7ZHDOO,Great romance movie. I loved how the director put romance and drama all in one with the murder mystery plot. It was a perfect combination. I love the movies this director has also made like The Notebook. I recommend them all.,1377388800,,225,4.512195121951219

5398520,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"Though rather predictable, this movie was done well. The actors did a good job and though I haven't read the book, the end plot twist did not come as a surprise to me. I won't say anything about it in case there are some who haven't read the book or seen the movie. Both main actors are talented and I hope Julianne Hough continues in her career and gets some great roles.",1377216000,,372,4.180555555555555

5398522,3,B00A7ZHDOO,Ok! not so great I expected  much more after reading the book. Many of the changes on the story from the book made the movie to lost the depth it had to it.  Violence against women exists and I feel in this movie it was  treated as less important than in the book.,1377216000,,264,3.943396226415094

5398538,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"Sparks crosses over from strictly chick flick to a bit of suspense in this one.  Josh Duhamel does his usual outstanding job in what is a better picture than those in which he has appeared in the past.  Hough did a serviceable job in a role that could have used a little more horsepower than she brought to bear.  One can't complain that she wasn't cute enough, of course.  The child actors were awesome.  But the real star was Southport where much of the movie takes place.  It has never looked better (and it has been in a lot of movies as well as in the current TV series Under the Dome).  I expect to watch this movie at least once a year - probably at the beach.",1377043200,,667,4.1640625

5398544,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"I might have enjoyed the movie more if I hadn't read the book.  Like most cases the book is so much better.  Why did they change Kristen's name to Lexie?  I wish they would've spent more time showing conversations between Katie and Jo. The movie doesn't reflect the close friendship they actually had.  I also wish they would have spent more time on Katie's history with her husband, or at least shown him at work and how he functioned more.  Would have shown the viewer the sociopath he really is.  I also didn't like that they were intimate (slept together) in the movie.  They didn't in the book, which really explains the delicacy in Katie and Alex as people, he still getting over his wife and she being able to let a man touch her like that again.",1376870400,4,753,4.413043478260869

5398563,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"A little confusing at first as to the relationship of the actors to each other.  Beautiful scenery and acting of the children was so real.  Julianne Hough was down to earth and a great actress.  Of course, Josh Duhamel is easy on the eyes!

As ""Safe Haven"" opens, young Erin Tierney (Julianne Hough)  is seen racing hysterically out of her suburban home, either the victim or the perpetrator of some terrible crime. She thereupon flees to a town in North Carolina so bucolic that one half expects the Waltons to come traipsing down the street at any moment bearing freshly-baked blueberry pies. Even though she's colored her hair and changed her name to Katie and is constantly looking over her shoulder for fear of exposure, Erin begins to make friends and establish connections in this idyllic locale - this despite the fact that she's being hunted by a tenacious and determined Boston detective (David Lyons) who refuses to give up the pursuit even when the trail appears to have gone cold.

For all its good intentions and lip service to reality, ""Safe Haven' is never able to shake its dime-novel aura and taint - not a surprise given that it is based on a work by Nicholas Sparks, that modern-day purveyor of romantic triteness best known, to movie audiences at least, for ""The Notebook."" The distraught woman just happens to land in a town that just happens to have a dreamy general store owner (Josh Duhamel) who just happens to be a widower with two young children, one an adorable little girl (and Mimi Kirkland really IS adorable) and the other a son who's having trouble coping with the loss of his mother who just happened to be in the flower of her womanhood when she died. And it all comes to a head in an absurdly melodramatic flourish at a Fourth of July fireworks celebration no less. If my tone sounds a mite cynical, it's probably because there is some real acting talent here and one hates to see it thrown away on such tripe. And it's a particular disappointment given that its director is the talented Lasse Halstrom who`s usually more discriminating in the material he selects.

As it is, though, ""Safe Haven"" will probably feel right at home someday as a Lifetime Movie of the Week. Check your local listings for time and date.",1376092800,,2018,4.692090395480226

5398599,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"I think this movie must have been a flop at the box office because I didn't remember seeing any previews for it when it was playing at the movies. In my opinion, it was a great movie. Yes, I know it is a chick flick and I am a guy, but still, this movie is one of my guilty pleasures. I especially like the part in the movie when Josh and Julianne are dancing to the song, ""Heart's Content"". It reminded me of the part in the movie ""Witness"" when Harrison Ford as John Book, and Kelly McGiliss as Rachel Lapp were dancing to the song, ""Wonderful World"". I am so glad I bought this movie on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith",1376006400,,625,4.216666666666667

Credits rolled, and I was just, ""What?!""

In any case, Josh Duhamel is a smokin' hottie and that's basically enough reason to watch, regardless of the supremely dumb ending.",1376006400,,459,4.7375

5398626,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"I really enjoyed Safe Haven-I read the book a couple years ago when it came out and fell in love with the story. I think many women can relate to or know someone like the female lead, Katie, and single dads could probably see themselves in Alex. The story is encompassing and thrilling all at the same time with Katie seemingly running from the law juxtaposed by her reluctant growing relationship with small town shop owner Alex. It is a story of love and forgiveness set in a quaint seaside town with a touch of the mysterious thrown in. A must see for Nicholas Sparks fans and romantics alike!",1375660800,,596,4.477064220183486
5398627,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"My partner and I decided to watch this simply because it seemed like it would be a good movie. This movie was exactly just that, a good movie and maybe even more. The movie does a good job of leading up to the reason's why the main character is trying to run away from her previous life. It makes you attached to all of the characters in the movie.

The scenery was setup perfectly for such a romantic movie. From the simple life of living outdoors to the seclusion of a house out in the country. This movie captivated our eyes while we watched it. The ending of the movie took us by surprise, since we both thought there wasn't anything more to the movie.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a really good romantic movie. It will surely bring at least one kind of element you can relate to.",1375574400,,815,4.251612903225807

5398664,4,B00A7ZHDOO,A feel good chick flick-ish film that was entertaining but somewhat predictable. I enjoyed it and the acting was well done. The story was well told and kept my interest throughout the entire film.,1375142400,,196,4.794117647058823

5398666,1,B00A7ZHDOO,"Instead of watching this film, rent the movie Sleeping with the Enemy starring Julie Roberts.  This story is basically the same story but the acting, dialogue, and suspense in that film were wonderful.  This movie was so boring and predictable I started surfing the net.  Josh Duhamel is hot but that was the highlight of this film.",1375142400,,332,4.7894736842105265

5398671,1,B00A7ZHDOO,"This movie is lame, I didn't watch it but I didn't need to. I can tell this movie is a chick flick because my wife was the one that rented it.

I soon realized it would be his loss. It was sweet like sugar and I liked it a lot. It has this bit of intrigue also because of the mystery going on. I liked that it wasn't just a lovey-dovey romance.
Being a woman who was once in an abusive relationship, at times the movie took me to places I wasn't sure I wanted to go to, but it didn't kill it for me or make me want to shut it off. On the contrary. I found myself immersed even more.
Now, honestly, it wasn't as good as The Notebook, but it was still decent.
Bring tissues for the end.... all I am saying on that.",1374883200,8,657,3.8740740740740742

5398705,4,B00A7ZHDOO,Safe Haven is sweet story of transforming love and learning to trust.  It does speak to the heart of domestic abuse and the ravages of addiction.  It's a great story of second chances and happily ever afters.,1374710400,,208,4.594594594594595
5398706,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"While any book/movie by Sparks is a treat, Safe Haven just missed the 5 star mark for me because of its slow plot in the middle. But, it held pretty true to the book and was just as romantic as I anticipated. Not as good as The Notebook, but then I think that will be very hard to top.",1374710400,,285,3.847457627118644
5398707,2,B00A7ZHDOO,It was a very predictable movie.  You knew what was going to happened before it happened.  The romance seamed very rushed and not authentic. Disappointing.,1374710400,,155,5.16

5398736,1,B00A7ZHDOO,I like Nicholas Sparks but I have to say this wasn't one of his best books to begin with. The movie is even worst. The actors are note very likable and the story falls into pieces too fast. Not worth the money.,1374624000,,210,4.023809523809524

5398739,5,B00A7ZHDOO,Another one of Nicholas Sparks movies brought to the big screen and as usual it is so good. I love his books and when they decided to make a movie from his books I knew they were going to be good to watch. I read his books over and over and now I will be watching his movies over and over. He is an excellent writer. Beautiful movie.,1374537600,,333,3.911764705882353

5398852,2,B00A7ZHDOO,"People who are giving this movie 4 and 5 stars, I beg of you, raise your standards!  First, let me say that Julianne Hough does a respectable job, especially for her lack of acting experience, and Duhamel is acceptable as well.  But, the move is incredibly slow until the last 30 minutes, the plot and details so unbelievable that I couldn't lose myself in the story, like a good movie should allow you to do.  The ""twist"" at the end just leaves you shaking your head, the perfect ""last straw"" for a movie that had too many implausible scenarios.  The implausibilities could have been so easily remedied but laziness appears to have been the order of the day when making this film.  This is NOT ""The Notebook"", by any stretch. The best thing about the movie is the little girl who plays Duhamel's daughter.  She's great!",1373068800,3,820,4.582191780821918

Because I read the book, I thought the book was better - the love scene in the movie was not in the book - I know that the movie likely needed the love scene for better ratings, but it was not necessary and a little bit far-fetched in the movie - the love story was more believable in the book.",1372982400,,374,3.9210526315789473

5398870,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"I was a domestic violence counselor for 24 years, so I know a little bit about the world of abusers and victims. I also know it is almost impossible to run away and permanently hide from a person determined to hurt you. I've seen lots of movies about family violence and read a dozen or more non-fiction treatments of the problem. Therefore, movies such as ""The Burning Bed"" and ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" and ""Safe Haven"" sometimes are problematic for me. In real life, the women in danger are not  usually movie-star attractive, and don't have professional writers giving them good job skills or irresistable personalities. The male abusers are less often respected professionals and more often substance-abusing low self-esteem marginal achievers. Are there exceptions to both of my depictions? Of course. But in domestic violence films, reality is simplified for the sake of a two-hour tale. And as a two-hour tale of a frightened woman's bid to escape an obsessed bully, ""Safe Haven"" is enjoyable and tense. No masterpiece, not the finest script ever penned, not the most superb acting you'll see this year, but not a waste of time. The twist ending will seem hokey five minutes after the credits roll, but for me, when it was revealed, it not only worked, it was the best thing about the whole production. I ""retired"" from the world of domestic violence prevention more than four years ago, and am glad to be distanced from the ugliness and tragedies of that problem. It's damned hard to reform the abusers, and surprisingly difficult to help victims make permanent, safer, healthier changes and choices. If a movie like this helps one victim decide to get away sensibly, or one abuser elect to get professional help before he ends up in jail or dead, it was worth making and watching.",1372896000,,1790,4.849673202614379

Being in the field of domestic violence I really wish it would have shown a lot more accurately what domestic violence really is.  IT would have had to be x rated for violence had they done so.

5398976,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"Safe Haven is a movie about a young woman who is running from her past and lands in Southport, North Carolina where her bond with a widower forces her to confront the dark secret that haunts her.

I know this is based on a novel but I am not familiar with that so I cant say how well it was translated from the book to the movie.  I do know that the author played a role as a producer so that should help with following the book.

Thinking this was your typical chick type flick, I wasn't too excited about watching this movie but I decided to give it a chance after hearing good things and see what it was about.  The movie at times was a little slow moving but had some beautiful scenic shots of North Carolina.  The little girl that played the daughter also was a bright spot as she seemed to bring some cuteness to the movie as well.  I felt the ""bad guy"" (Played by David Lyons) in the movie could have been acted a bit better though and to me was the weak point.  I just felt that he didn't play very well the drunken jealous abusing husband and that it could have been done better and more believable.  I just didn't think he played it angry enough to make me believe that he was going to do what he did in the movie.

Even though the movie was slow at times, the ending to me made the movie a decent one to watch.  Even though this movie goes into your typical happily ever after type ending, this one has a bit of a surprise at the end that gives it something different than your run of them mill romance movie.  I won't spoil the ending for you here but the ending makes this movie a decent one to watch, especially with your significant other that will surely make her cry.",1371945600,21,1684,4.1192660550458715
5398977,5,B00A7ZHDOO,Safe Haven was a pretty good movie. I waited for it come out in digits because I didn't think it was theater worthy. After watching it I realized it was much better than the critics said it was. Both leads in the movie did an outstanding job. It was nicely written. Only draw back is it was a little predictable. But  over all a great chick flick.,1371945600,,347,4.17910447761194

5399039,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"It has a simple plot that gets right into the heart of the movie.

Wouldn't want to watch it if I already knew ahead of time what the movie was all about.",1371513600,,154,3.8125

5399041,3,B00A7ZHDOO,Not as good as I expected it to be.  Kind of corny if you ask me.  I was not too impressed.  Nothing special.,1371513600,,109,3.652173913043478

The lighting was so dark throughout the entire film, at first i thought it was for dramatic affect but then got frustrated trying to watch the whole movie.",1371427200,,193,4.388888888888889
5399053,1,B00A7ZHDOO,Please don't watch this movie! No matter what anyone tells you. Most Nicholas sparks movies are good. This one was ridiculous,1371427200,2,125,5.0

5399058,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"I rented this movie to see Noah Lomax since he is the nephew of a friend of mine.  The movie is tolerable.  I love the setting since Southport, NC, is such a charming town, but I was disappointed that Noah's role was so small;  however, that's really no reflection on the movie.  Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel were very good.",1371340800,,327,4.4
5399059,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"Sometimes I need a ""chick flick"" fix, and this one fit the bill perfectly. It was a sweetly crafted love story with a bit of suspense. I cared about the characters - Josh Duhamel is definitely eye-candy but he is also a good actor - never over-acting, or wooden in his delivery. He is entirely believable as the good guy - easy-going and credible. Julianne Hough surprised me with her own acting skills. It wasn't an oscar caliber movie, but usually, those that are, bore me to tears. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the surprise at the end, which I won't ruin for anyone who hasn't seen it.",1371340800,,599,4.454545454545454

5399061,2,B00A7ZHDOO,Suggest Julianne Hough go back to singing and dancing -- the acting just wasn't credible. Josh Dushanel did a better job and would like to see him in another movie,1371340800,,163,4.466666666666667
5399062,2,B00A7ZHDOO,The movie was OK. The book was so much better. The movie was a bit corny if you ask me.,1371340800,,87,3.4

5399079,5,B00A7ZHDOO,Best love story/thriller of the year! Several twists and a payoff you'll never see coming. Loved this movie. Saw it in the theatre when it first came out and knew I had to own it. We've been to the city of South Port NC where this was filmed and love the town. This film reinforces the beauty of this quaint seaboard town. I think I'll watch it again tonight.,1371168000,,359,4.217391304347826
5399080,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"I really enjoyed this movie. Fear, the trimuph over it. Learning to trust enough to let your gaurd down and fall in love again.",1371168000,,127,4.333333333333333
5399081,3,B00A7ZHDOO,It was ok pretty much what you would think. Girl married bad guy. Girl leaves bad guy. Bag guy goes crazy losing Girl. Girl moves to a new town falls in love with a beautiful man. Beautiful man saves Girl from Bad Guy.,1371168000,,218,4.093023255813954

5399094,5,B00A7ZHDOO,It had the love story plus the crazy guy following in jealousy. Everything a love story should be!! Would definitely recommend it,1371168000,,129,4.909090909090909
5399095,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"Anything by Nicholas Sparks is great!  The storyline was great, made me cry, that's what ""girlie movies"" are for. My husband even enjoyed it.",1371168000,,141,4.875
5399096,5,B00A7ZHDOO,We were looking for something to watch one night and chose this movie because it stars Julianne Hough.  I think it helps if your expectations are low to begin with (it seems whenever I'm expecting a movie to be great I'm disappointed).  Both my husband and I enjoyed this movie very much.  The ending caught me by surprise.  I like movies with twists and turns--that I can understand :),1371168000,,386,4.550724637681159
5399097,5,B00A7ZHDOO,All that I expected.  I had already read the book and seeing the movie just make it perfect for me.  I try to read or watch anything having to do with Nicholas Sparks.  Never disappointed.,1371168000,,188,4.314285714285714

5399099,1,B00A7ZHDOO,I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater so I was excited when I was able to pre order it through Amazon. But when I received it the case was bent and looked like it had been through the ringer. Amazon if it looks like something you wouldn't want to own don't send it to your customers.,1371168000,,293,3.9
5399100,5,B00A7ZHDOO,The actor is so gorgeous and his acting isn't bad either.  I really really like Gillian Hough's character and how she make you empathizes really well with her as you receive more of the storyline.  The last few seconds of the movie are a little confusing but over all it was a wonderful movie.  Nicholas Sparks does it again and I like how you don't know how he is going to end his movies anymore like the previous ones.,1371168000,,420,4.291139240506329

5399125,5,B00A7ZHDOO,I loved this movie from the first moment I saw a preview for it at the cinema.  Saw it and fell in love with it.  I have since bought and read the book and just had to add this title to my collection.,1370995200,,200,3.627906976744186
5399126,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"Enjoyable. Probably would've given 3 1/2 stars if 1/2 star was available. Nothing earth shattering, but an easy watch in typical Nicholas Sparks style.",1370995200,,151,5.333333333333333

5399130,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"Romance drama about a girl named Katie running from her past, while looking for the strength to embrace a new future. This movie got several harsh reviews however in my opinion its worth watching.",1370995200,,196,4.794117647058823
5399131,1,B00A7ZHDOO,"Oh, it's got all the ingredients for your typical Sparks film:  Waterside set, B list actors, young children they nearly kill off to give your heart a little flutter.  I usually like cliched romantic movies.  They make me incredibly happy that I have a normal, healthy relationship with men instead of what the entertainment industry wants me to desire.  However, this movie was just TOO predictable, TOO dry and didn't have any chemistry between the two main characters.  Where is the witty dialogue and on screen sparks?",1370995200,3,522,4.954022988505747

5399133,5,B00A7ZHDOO,This book was really good. I wanted it watch it before the movie and im SO glad I did! The book (Like all books) goes into greater detail and gets you into the mind of the characters. I actually didn't really care for the move and would def recommend to skip the movie and read the book!,1370995200,,287,4.052631578947368

5399136,2,B00A7ZHDOO,"Ok so this is my first time reading a book then watching the film. I know understand what people mean! This movie was garbage compared to the book! Maybe if i never read the book i would have appreciated the movie more but hey we will never know! I definitely would not watch it again though.

I suggest you read the book! if you even liked the movie (wow) i would definitely suggest you read the book cuz you will probably go ape ish over it! lol.",1370908800,,448,4.149425287356322

5399140,2,B00A7ZHDOO,The ending absolutely ruined this movie for me. The entire movie was great up until the last 30 seconds. I hate when movies take a complete 180 in the last few seconds.,1370822400,,168,4.28125

5399150,5,B00A7ZHDOO,Pay close attention to the story line. Its a love story that  grabs you and keeps you watching. The ending will take you by surprise. I'd have the tissue handy.  Well worth the rent and would definitely watch again.,1370736000,,215,4.487179487179487

5399152,1,B00A7ZHDOO,Pathetic writing with dull warmed-over acting. Don't bother watching now if you feel you must see it.  Wait for it free on Netflix so you won't be so pissed having spent good money AND your valuable time on this crap.,1370736000,2,217,4.425

5399156,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"My teen (13) daughter and her friend ordered it because they heard it was good, but it was all about a women who runs away from her wife beating police husband, so I would not recommend it to teen girls.",1370649600,,203,4.1
5399157,3,B00A7ZHDOO,Thought that because it was written by N Sparks it would automatically be an excellent movie.  It was good but not as good as I had expected it would be,1370649600,,152,4.066666666666666

5399161,2,B00A7ZHDOO,A waste of time and money.  Julianne Hough is a much better dancer than actress. I did not like it at all.,1370649600,,106,3.8181818181818183
5399162,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"I was kinda worried how this movie would be because I wasn't impressed with Nicholas Sparks' last book/movie The Lucky One. This movie was even better than I could've imagined though! I loved it! The actors did great with the characters and the story kept moving and was just overall a great movie! The movie was also very clean, no sex scenes and don't remember any swearing which was nice... hard to find movies anymore that don't drop the f*.

5399163,5,B00A7ZHDOO,This story was a top-knotch example of a man loving a woman enough to make sacrifices for her best interest. The woman did the same. Wow! Not enough of these movies out there! It was another example of the writer's terrific style!,1370649600,,230,4.5
5399164,2,B00A7ZHDOO,"Because ""The Notebook"" was such a great movie, I keep trying every new Nicholas Sparks adaptation...but I continue to be disappointed. This movie had subplots with no development and the main story line was fairly unbelievable. The acting wasn't too bad but the chemistry between Josh Duhamel and Julianne Hough was more of a brother/sister one...which made the love scenes unbelievable and creepy. The best parts of the movie were any scenes with little Mimi Kirkland- what a great little actress. Overall- the okay acting and beautiful scenery could not make up for the weak plot.",1370649600,,582,5.072916666666667
5399165,3,B00A7ZHDOO,I've read all of Nicholas Sparks books and seen all his movies. Message in a Bottle has been my favorite for years. This was okay..it was a better book than movie. Julianne Hough was good.,1370649600,,188,4.4
5399166,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"An okay diversion. Not bad, not great. Since I live near here, I wanted to see how Southport looked in the film. Not much suspense was built-- Hitchcock would have done it better, but that's just me grousing. For what it is, the movie is a couple of hours of escape.",1370649600,,266,4.235294117647059
5399167,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"I've liked very much this movie from Lasse Hallstrm. He always told such beautiful stories in his movies (Chocolat, What's eating Gilbert Grape). This one is not the best but there is a good suspense. We understand little by little the story of this young woman, she lived the drama and now begins a love story in this charming seaside town.",1370563200,,341,4.60655737704918
5399168,4,B00A7ZHDOO,It wasn't the best movie I have seen but it was a pretty good chick flick and I enjoyed it.,1370563200,,91,3.6

5399170,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"Of course it is, it's based on a Spark's book. But the scenery in the movie is beautiful, Duhamel and the kids are great and the story has a twist at the end. Doubt Julianne Hough is going to win an Academy Award for her performance though.",1370476800,,240,4.127659574468085
5399171,2,B00A7ZHDOO,"Let me start by saying this movie usually wouldn't be my first choice anyway...so I am probably a tough critic. BUT I loved The Notebook and can sometimes be drawn in by a good love story. This is not one of those times. Safe Haven's critical points were so unbelievable that I couldn't ever really get beyond the fact that these essential elements would NEVER happen.  Not even in my fantasy love story dreams. Is this an action adventure? Is this a romantic drama? Make up your mind, because it doesn't work on either level. (I'd give examples but don't want to ruin it for you if you decide to watch this movie.) Next, the characters just never realize. They remain somewhat two dimensional and I never really care about them. The combination of those two things keep this movie solidly in the bad movie category.",1370476800,2,816,4.589041095890411

5399175,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"Nicolas Sparks is the master of pulling at your heartstrings and giving you ooey gooey reach for the tissue moments and he delivers again here. This an okay movie, interesting ride but pretty much what you expect from Sparks. Pacing hurt this movie some too. There were moments- like when they were building the connections between the characters that felt rushed and other moments that seemed to drag. No real surprises, the mystery was pretty predictable- even my husband unraveled and called the ending right down to ""the twist"" but if you like Sparks and having your emotions toyed with- you'll like this movie. I have to be in the mood for a Sparks book or film. Tonight I was and got what I expected.",1370390400,,706,4.656
5399176,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"I loved ""Safe Haven""!! Great plot and actors/actresses. Nicholas Sparks outdone himself with this movie!

5399178,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"Rented for spousal unit. Predictable variation of ""Living with the Enemy"" but all that said, well paced and enjoyable. No great life lesson here but that ok.

5399184,4,B00A7ZHDOO,I loved this movie. I would have given it 5 stars except for the language and sex scenes.  The story was great though.,1370390400,,118,4.130434782608695

5399186,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and this is by far my favorite Nicholas Sparks movie.  It stayed pretty true to the book, and the actors worked wonderfully together.

5399189,5,B00A7ZHDOO,Safe Haven was an excellent movie and book and kept you spell bound to the end with a surprise ending.  I liked both the main actors very much.  I highly recommend both movie and book.,1370390400,,184,4.228571428571429

5399250,3,B00A7ZHDOO,"I read the book and was excited to see the movie.  I loved the book.  I thought the actors did a good job of matching my impressions of the main characters in the book.  But, maybe the movie directors, producers, and even actors care only about the bottom line (revenue) and could care less about integrity, substance, or following the writer's book. (What happened to Alex's grey hair??) Maybe the writer should be questioned about why he sold out.  He gave the movie moguls free reign.  I know little can be done in under 2hrs (normal movie length).  But, I came away from the movie feeling cheated.  Not by Julianne Hough, Josh Duhamel, Mimi Kirkland, Noah Lomax, or Cobie Smulders.  The entire cast was great. They did what they were directed to do and are all good at what they do.  I just dislike the idea of being fed BS for what I though was a very good novel. Maybe I should stick to reading books and leave the movies on the shelves.",1369699200,,943,4.404624277456647

But all I could think of beforehand was that this was sure to be just another chick flick, which is not my cup of tea.

5399291,5,B00A7ZHDOO,So true in real life.  Can't escape a crazy person no matter how hard you try.  The crazy thing is you don't see it coming till to late.  They portray life as it really happens.  Even as a police officer you can be crazy.,1369440000,,221,3.9545454545454546

5399296,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"Okay so I watched this 6 times in a row last Saturday.  I loved it!!! Having Josh Duhamel and Julianne Hough doesn't hurt either.  These two look like they should be a real life couple they have such amazing chemistry. So I am not usually a mushy romantic movie person I find the unrealistic and predictable. This. Movie had me glued from the moment it started. Julianne Hough's character is abused woman on the run and she winds up in this little sea tourist town. She decides to stay and starts her life over as Katie.  Josh's character is a widower with two adorable kids.  The two character's met and of course fall in love.  Of course ""Katie's"" character's past shows up and threatens to ruin her new life and we have the predictable show down at the end.  But there is a twisted at the very end I never saw coming and it gave me chills.  I just  have to say I truly love this movie and would recommend it to all to watch it.

5399298,2,B00A7ZHDOO,The characters were emotionless and bland. Loved the plot twist but not enough to recommend the film. Why would anyone make a film where the audience is so disrespected?

This one had a different quirk to it (the enraged, sociopath of a husband, determined to find his runaway wife), giving it more substance for me, and though you can tell how ANY Nicholas Spark book or film is going to end, this one held my interest. Worth it purely for chick-flick lovers, but nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be; the suspense elements were a nice change for a Sparks' story.",1369353600,,602,4.198275862068965

Don't get me wrong it was a great movie but if youve read the book you become very critical. Most Nicholas Sparks movies are well done and stick more to the book than this. I do not like when back stories that make the character who they are and names of characters are changed. It really looses the book. Her past is different and it really takes away from who she is. I reccomend NOT reading the book before the movie or you will ruin it for yourself.",1369267200,3,563,4.174311926605505

5399356,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"Movies such as this are a breath of fresh air. Particularly when they are based on novels by those with the literary magic of Nicholas Sparks. There's a dash of everything in this. Romance, drama, suspense, and there's even a surprise twist of the supernatural, but there's no over the top blood and guts & gratuitous violence that audiences have been programmed to cheer for. So of course you're going to have your eye rolls & sneers from a certain contingent, who will say that this is a candy coated chick flick. FAR from it. The addressal of the issue of domestic violence and the fear it creates is something that hit very close to home for me with this film. The entire cast owned their roles. Duhamel was perfect as the down to earth, vulnerable widower struggling to raise his children solo, following their Mother's tragic death. His guy next door charm & sex appeal is far from being unnatural or forced. He is not the stereotypical Handsome Hollywood Puppet. He is beautiful in a natural, everyman way. The complete package imo. And his chemistry with Hough sizzles. This is a woman who is a threat on every level. Singing, dancing, and now acting? She, too, is completely believable and so damn likeable throughout the entire movie. More than just a flawlessly gorgeous face, her every expression and interaction, whether solo, or in conjuction with the other characters is spot on. The children of Duhamel's character are two of the most realistic, natural talents I've seen in ages. I typically find myself annoyed by many over dramatic child actors. Not in this case! And even the villian of the film brings his own thunderbolts of talent. Never campy or cartoonish, he  chills me, because I KNOW that kind of man. And this is not a made for film only kind of performance he puts out. This was such a simple film that is saturated in reality, but I guarantee the surprise twist at the end takes an already stellar story and makes it magical. Realistic? Perhaps not, but a wonderful addition all the same to what is now one of my favorite movies. I wouldn't doubt if you immediatly go for another run through, just to ""catch"" what you might have missed the first time. I know I did. And I will again...and again...with the copy I just ordered.",1368921600,,2257,4.6425

5399398,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"The 411 by Maria:

I just finished wiping my tears and the tightness in my throat has finally subsided. While I have never read Safe Haven, I find myself longing to dive into the book now that I have seen this beautiful movie.

Julianne is great as Katie/Erin a woman who is running from something. She finds herself in sun filled, North Caroline and she decides this is the place for a fresh new start.

Alex played by Josh is a widower of two, a boy and girl who runs a convenience store down on the docks.

As fate would have it these two beautiful people gravitate toward each other and make nice before Katie/Erin's past threatens to end what they have before it has even begun.

This sweet story has so many loveable characters Julianne definitely holds her own as a female lead and who doesn't love Josh? But there were other great characters too, especially the two young actors playing Josh's family. Mimi Kirkland as Lexie Wheatley in her acting debut is simply adorable and Noah Lomax as Josh Wheatley are very sweet. I also love Roger, Red West who has an acting bio a mile long and absolutely loved Katie's only friend Jo played by Cobie Smulders.

Ohhhhh yeah and I absolutely was in loving with the coloring of the movie. Very poetic, thought provoking and muted. A perfect palate.

The surprise ending was definitely an eye opening moment for me and I don't know how I didn't see it coming.

Truly a lovely movie with a little mystery, a little drama, a tiny bit of comedy, romance, and a whole lot of heart.

5399407,4,B00A7ZHDOO,If you want a good chick flick that isn't too intense this is one to watch.  Josh is just yummy!  ... and Julianne isn't bad either according to my husband.  It does have several interesting twists in it to keep your attention.  The harbor town in the movie is really picturesque and definitely a place I want to visit.,1368576000,,319,4.3559322033898304

5399411,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"By Jim Clark, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi
Safe Haven is classified as an American romance film. It is certainly that. It was based on a novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks. Nicholas also penned The Notebook, Dear John and The Lucky One. It is also a drama, mixed with laughs, some thrills and intense character study.
Katie  (Julianne Hough) leaves Boston abruptly for the small coastal community of Southport, North Carolina. She is fleeing from her abusive husband, who she thinks she may have killed in a massive fight before she took off.
Her husband, Kevin Tierney (David Lyons) is a Boston cop, very much alive and intent in finding his spouse.
Katie attempts to live quietly but sparks a friendship with Alex Wheatley (Josh Duhamel) the manager of a local convenience store. He is a single dad, trying to raise a daughter and son. He lost his wife to cancer a few years ago.
The girl Lexie (Mimi Kirkland) loves the idea of having Katie around, the son Josh (Noah Lomax) not so much. This was Kirkland's big screen debut. The eight-year-old is a wonderful little actress, and one we'll certainly see more of.
Safe Haven is reminiscent of Sleeping with the Enemy, so if you liked that, you'll love this.
It was filmed primarily in Wilmington and Southport, North Carolina, with bits done in Louisiana.
It's a film you can feel good about renting or buying. Sparks and his wife had donated ""close to $10 million"" to start a Christian, international, college-prep private school, The Epiphany School, which emphasizes travel and lifelong learning.",1368576000,,1569,4.854477611940299

5399413,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"Another great movie from Nicholas Sparks! This movie had it all. It was the perfect balance of mystery and suspense, romance and humor. Julianne Hough is proving to be a very convincing actress in whatever roll she plays. She can hold her own against seasoned peers of the craft. She has a genuine warmth and depth of character that makes her a joy to watch. Josh Duhamel, what needs to be said? He's ruggedly adorable! He plays his character with such comfortable ease that you would almost think the part was written based on him.. The love scenes were tastefully subtle, yet steamy. The unexpected twist at the end was intriguing. I liked the idea of letters being written by the dying mother to her children to be given at their graduation, weddings, etc. The only thing I didn't like is the occult symbol in the necklace given to Katie, the main character. Occult symbolism permeates everything from Disney animations to the music industry, and everything coming out of Hollywood. Tired of seeing it everywhere and in everything! Occultism has come out of the closet, so to speak, and Hollywood  shoves it in our faces constantly.",1368576000,,1135,4.790816326530612

The story line may be a little less appealing than most movies; however, Josh Duhamel's terrible haircut does at times make for interesting viewing. Hough offers a visual delight but an otherwise uninspiring performance.

I recommend this movie if you are looking for a way to kill a couple of hours or if you just need a cute movie to watch with your love. Otherwise, keep browsing.",1368576000,,496,4.7011494252873565

I haven't seen these actors before (and if I have I don't remember them) and I thought they did a pretty good job. That little girl was adorable. The heroine was put in an impossible position and I thought it resembled ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" with Julia Roberts, but it was a different theme and setting. The movie was more chick flick than thriller, but it had it's moments that made me a bit jumpy. The chemistry between them seemed real enough.

And of course, one sees these same plastic, one-note faces on Amy Adams and Katherine Heigel who even as they parade around in, virtually, nothing, proclaim their ""innocent"" natures and allegiance to Mormonism.

Hough is not the worst actress to ever be cast in a movie; she is The Very Worst because she is not an actress. One would think that Tom Cruise, who generally does great movies, would have known better. Really, does pelvic thrusting qualify as a resume? Next up for Hough is (apparently) Paradise where she will once again put on the plastic face (aka you-will-sit-in-this-Mormon-pew-for-five-hours-and-pretend-that-Mormonism-is-not-a-crock-rather-than-the-pyramid-gestapo-scheme-it-really-is) and pretend that she actually got these roles by way of ""talent"", albeit masquerading as someones ""girlfriend.

Katie (Julianne Hough) did a good job playing the runaway and Alex (Josh Dunamel) was also very good as the local man in the safe haven who is attracted to Katie. We thought the acting was good in the film but perhaps the Psycho Cop was overdone a bit.

The story line is good and it is a suspense film with a love story built in. It has a surprise ending and we liked the movie. It was not rated well by the professional critics but like many other movies we liked it and they didn't. So what else is new? People like to criticize Julianne's acting but we thought she did a good job. The movie is worth watching.",1368316800,,1077,4.02803738317757

Although pretty predictable up until the end, I really liked the film... until the ""surprise"" ending, which I would label more ""ridiculous"" than surprising. Without the ending, this could have been a film that I would have purchased and watched over and over on those rainy days where I just wanted to veg out to a ""feel good"" movie.

5399488,3,B00A7ZHDOO,After reading the book I had an image of what the characters should look like & the main characters in the movie were too good looking & too aggressive to bring the story to life the way the book did. Aside from that the quality of the movie was a little made-for-tv but still entertaining. I'm a little disappointed that I bought rather than renting though...because I will probably never watch it again.,1368230400,,405,4.561643835616438

5399490,4,B00A7ZHDOO,"I've never been a fan of Nicholas Sparks; I read A Walk to Remember when I was in high school at the recommendation of my friends who all cried and went bananas over the book, but I was unimpressed. Since then, I've been turning my nose up at anything having to do with Sparks. And then, for some reason, maybe because it was so cheap, I bought the book Safe Haven on my Kindle, blew through it in no time, and found that I actually enjoyed the story, especially because the book allows readers into the mind of the man after the heroine.

It follows then that I had to see this movie.

Katie (Julianne Hough) is a girl on the run -- from what the viewers don't know, but it's not that hard to figure out. If you're one of those viewers who falls for every, single thing shown on screen, then what she's running from may come as a surprise, but then I just feel sorry for you. She makes her way from Boston to a small town in (North?) Carolina. Location doesn't matter. What matters is that she's found her ""safe haven,"" far from whatever troubles she had been running from. She makes friends with a little girl, Lexie, who's father, Alex (Josh Duhamel), owns the general store right on the water. Katie also makes another friend named Jo, a woman who claims to be a neighbor to Katie's teeny shanty in the woods. Katie frequents the store to buy rice and paint and what not and continues to be friendly with Lexie, which of course interests Alex, as does the mystery of her appearance in the town at all. Cue the mellow tunes, show the waves lapping, show small town people walking down the street, have a parade, catch fish, go canoeing... These things, however, do not mean that this movie is your typical rom-com. I'd call it more of a wannabe thriller/romantic movie. It's not really funny. Forget the com.

While I'm glad I didn't pay theater prices, it's worth a rental, especially if you like good looking people frolicking in idyllic settings, making goo goo guys at each other, with a happy ending that'll make you go, ""Aww..."" and ""Holy crap!"" at the same time (if you haven't read the book that is... if you have, then obviously nothing will come as a surprise.)

I was annoyed that Julianne Hough's character, Katie, wasn't as terrified or vulnerable as her novel counterpart. Her genuine fear of men is part of what made the book interesting, and I didn't get the sense at all that she was afraid of Alex in the same way she is in the book. The movie would've been more interesting if they filmmakers had characterized Alex and Katie in the same way. (And don't even bother saying to me, ""But they have to make changes in order to adapt from page to screen."" Bull honky.)

Despite the missed opportunities in terms of characterization, I still found myself rooting for Katie, so if you like these two actors, like this book (and won't freak the **** out by some changes), then you'll most likely enjoy this movie.",1368230400,9,2927,4.463551401869159

5399508,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"Definitely worth the money. For those who are judging, this movie wasn't supposed to be some big romantic hit. Neither were any of the other movies (Dear John, The Notebook, etc...) - although, they did make quite an impact. But the purpose of Nicholas Sparks' books and the movies based on them is truth. Love at it's purest. It's about the story, not ""Emmy-worthy"" acting or (like someone pointed out and of which is ridiculous to base a movie on) the scratchiness of one's voice. Julianne Hough plays her character with a great honesty. You may not think it's the best acting compared to other actresses (who have a ton more experience, keep in mind), but she will make you believe her character. And to me, that's all I can ask of an actor/actress - to make me believe their performance. I want to feel that it's real, not that they're just doing a job - which, unfortunately, you can tell in a lot of movies lately. But this movie does just that, I really felt everything in this movie.",1367193600,,991,4.511111111111111

Pretty good at making me snooze - first the story (a typical Nicholas Sparks) was all a doozer.  No real storyline other than she looks crazy running around hiding and acting all mysterious.  Then you have the do-gooder - Josh D. falling in love with her and trying to protect her from something she never even explains until mid way thru the movie.  I didn't like it but maybe you will :)",1364947200,6,525,4.22
5399511,5,B00A7ZHDOO,"Let me first start off saying that I was one of those movie-goers who had the advantage of seeing Safe Haven on opening night with my husband. Since it's release I have went back two other times to the Cinema because the first go around kept me wanting more. To sum it up, that is exactly what Safe Haven does...it keeps the audience wanting more.

  Nicholas Sparks has a way of pulling the heart strings of young adult readers world wide and when one of his books hits the Cinema you better watch out for a stampede of avid book worms alike. The chemistry between Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel is intoxicating! You are immediately swept off your feet with Southport, North Carolina and the charm of it's close knit community. The musical score of the movie is superb. Blending seamlessly throughout the picture and leaving you humming the quaint tunes out of the theater.

  I won't go into the story line as other reviews had. But,I would say to give this movie an honest chance. It has real heart and is definitely a suspenseful chick flick that makes even the male audience intrigued.",1364860800,,1091,4.597938144329897

You figure out real quickly that she did not murder anyone and her husband is so obviously alive.  They create moments of suspense when the building burns down but other than that very predicable.  And Robin Scherbatsky keeps showing up as her imaginary friend which just seems a little out of place until the end.,1364860800,,447,4.349397590361446
5399513,2,B00A7ZHDOO,"""There is more than one way to skin a cat"" has got to be humorously posted on a some wall somewhere within the offices of Nicholas Sparks Productions.  The latest proof of this has arrived in the form of Safe Haven.

In Safe Haven, Katie (Julianne Hough) is introduced frantically attempting to escape being chased down by a Boston Police Officer (David Lyons).  The mystery of the film revolves around why this chase is taking place, but of course the point of this film revolves around her somehow ending up in North Carolina with a handsome man.  ""Write about where you know"" has got to be humorously posted on some wall in Nicholas Sparks's North Carolina home.

Katie does end up in the aforementioned state in the tiny town of Sea Port.  Sea Port offers all of the necessities for Sparks to work his magic: quiet streams for canoeing, beaches with virtually no one around, general stores, rusticity, no technology, one big event (that apparently draws over 100,000 people in for a day), and a laissez faire attitude.  Predictability ensues, but not to an offensive degree.

This is the eighth Sparks novel to get the cinematic treatment, but it may as well be the eightieth.  It rarely rises above standard TV movie production quality and offers nothing unexpected to the viewers.  What it can cash in on is the likability and chemistry between its main co-stars Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel.  I suspect that this is the main reason the film got green-lit at all.  An attempt, albeit a failed one, at adding some edge accomplishes little more than The Lucky One was able to accomplish last year.  What is surprising is that the novel does have some edgy back-story, but director Lasse Hallstrm and screenwriter Dana Stevens chose to downplay, simplify, and blatantly avoid these opportunities preventing this film from elevating itself above the standard warmed over genre-film that it became.  Formulas exist because they provide the framework for pleasing an audience, but unfortunately they grow tremendously stale and unsatisfying if they are not tweaked and modified from time to time.  This is a lazy movie from start to finish, and it is an apparent Valentine's Day cash-grab at a movie hungry audience looking for a romantic film during a barren movie season.  Like most films that receive reviews like this, it will be very comforting to those who go in knowing what to expect and unappealing to everyone else.  How do you grade a film like this?  Skin the C off the cat.",1364774400,11,2489,4.816470588235294

The book is so much better because you get to know Katie and you realize what she went through before coming to Southport. The movie spends almost no time on Katie's (Julianne Hough) backstory. There is scuffle at the beginning of the movie and she takes off on a bus and somehow winds up in NC. The actors that portray the characters do a really great job. There is a sex scene, but nothing is shown much, in the movie. But in the book , the two main characters are not in sexual relationship. So do not blame Nicholas Sparks for that, blame the movie scripwriter. The two characters in the book get to know each other over time, while the abusive husband tries to figure out where she went to . The book makes more sense, but the movie is decent because of Southport and Julianne and Josh Duhmel. Its a good flick and i will be buying when it comes out.",1364601600,,1057,4.211822660098522

I liked the whole environment and characters. The music that is used in it is good and makes it wholesome. It was a love story, but yet so different. It seemed many times that the end has to be sad and the movie kept the suspense until the end. I don't want to spoil it, but I recommend it.

The book on which this is based is by Nicholas Sparks (""The Notebook"") so it MUST be romantic, right? And there has to be an idyllic boat ride on a bayou...and two lovers caught in the rain. The movie is directed by Lasse Hallstrm (""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"") so it will feel like real people in a real situation, with humorous bits tossed in just for fun. As you can tell, this was actually pretty good because we had plenty of people to root for.

We watched:
  * Josh Duhamel (""Transformers,"" ""New Year's Eve"" and lots of TV) as Alex, a widower of two years, helping his two youngsters cope with their loss and helping his uncle run a little grocery store/gas station/tackle shop in a North Carolina fishing village. BTW, this actor is really good with children!
  * Noah Lomax (Lots of TV) is Josh, his older child who remembers, and still misses, his mom.
  * Mimi Kirkland in her first movie role, is Lexie, the younger child who only remembers the idea of her mother. She's a precocious, loyal little busybody.
  * Julianne Hough (""Rock of Ages"" and ""Footloose"") is Katie, fleeing for her life from Boston and trying to find a safe haven beyond the reach of her pursuer.
  * Cobie Smulders (""The Avengers"") is Jo, the lovely neighbor who befriends our heroine.
  * David Lyons (Lots of TV) is either a cop, an abandoned husband, or both.

There are plenty of other characters, but time does not permit... I could have done without some of the bucolic photography, but it was only 115 minutes. Suffice it to say, this had no profanity and some chaste love making, but had a real nail-biter of a climax and a totally unexpected twist...plus Duhamel is VERY easy on the eye!

Then, she finds a place to feel safe and starts to enjoy her new dwellings.  Throughout the movie you will learn about what she is afraid of and what happened to finally free her and make her run.  Then, there may just be something in the movie that will happen that makes you have this weird feeling in your gut.  I will not say anything though.

The chemistry between the actor that plays the father and the actress that plays the girl is amazing.  They are so good at playing nervous, anxious people who are falling for one another.  You will come to like both of them and hope for good things to happen.  There is someone else in the movie as well.  A detective/cop.  His role in the movie is important.

The kids that play the mans kids are great.  They are such good actors.  I am proud of them.  They never get in the way of anything that is going on.  You see them for the perfect amount of time.  In the time you see them you will understand their pain and their reasons for doing what they do.

Another thing that I liked about this movie is the location.  It seems to have a small town feeling.  Some movies go all over the place.  But this movies was really in one place.  It let you feel safe.  Like you were at home and nothing could happen.  Very well done.

This is a great movie for a man, women, or both to watch.  It really makes you thankful for those you have that you can love and who love you.  As soon as this comes out, I am buying it.  One of those movies that is great to watch on a rainy night.  A great movie!!!!
