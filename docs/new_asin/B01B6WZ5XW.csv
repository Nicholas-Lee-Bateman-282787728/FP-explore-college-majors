7622383,4,B01B6WZ5XW,"This was an enjoyable western television show for its time, although it could have been better if it had been an hour long show.  While I was glad to see this show finally released on DVD, I was highly disappointed when I discovered these are incomplete seasons, although they're advertised as such.  For instance, the first 2 episodes of season 4 are not included.  This is just one example.  So buyers beware.",1456444800,5,411,4.666666666666667
7622384,5,B01B6WZ5XW,"loved all 4 seasons of this warner bros. t.v classic John Russell and Peter Brown made an excellent team and all the supporting actors, especially lovely Peggie Castle as Lily,  were superb. Now, Warner archives whats next?  COLT 45.  THE ALASKANS  OR The detective shows 77 SUNSET STRIP, HAWAIIAN EYE, SURFSIDE 6 and BOURBON STREET BEAT.  Personally, I would love to see the 2 seasons of THE ROARING 20's  whatever,  if its a Warner Bros. classic it's a great one------just like LAWMAN  BRING THEM ALL ON",1455667200,4,505,4.790697674418604

Now it's only too sad ABC chose to cancel this series in favor of a Sunday movie of the week -- a formula which stayed in place through high school, college and beyond until the network movie of the week and TV movie died an unnatural death and cannot be found but on the odd cable network such as Hallmark.
