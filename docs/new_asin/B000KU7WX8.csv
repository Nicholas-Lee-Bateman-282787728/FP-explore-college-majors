8159077,3,B000KU7WX8,"Part of the 100 sci fi greats pack. Written and directed by a UFO nut. Special effects similar to Lost in Space.  As part of a 100 pack it cost 13 cents, Perhaps I overpaid.",1419897600,,173,3.942857142857143
8159078,3,B000KU7WX8,"Photograph Peter Collins (Franco Garafalo, who starred in other truly great movies like ""Cop in Drag"" and ""The Scorpion with Two Tails"") and model Karin Hale (Sherry Buchanan, who appeared in a number of mostly forgettable movies and television shows) are romping in the woods, occasionally taking pictures.  Apparently, some of Peter's photographs show aliens in the woods.  The movie never explains why the aliens were in the woods, but maybe they were smitten with Karin Hale, who was quite pretty in this movie.  I would suggest that they might be smitten with Peter, but Peter was one ugly dude with a bad haircut to match, so perhaps not.  Then again, Peter is the one who was probed by the aliens (I am jumping ahead a little here), so maybe he was their target.

Moving onward, once Peter snapped the pictures of the aliens in woods, the aliens went on a rampage, apparently to eliminate the photographic evidence and some of the people associated with UFO research.  The aliens snatch Peter and take him to their model spaceship, which includes the ""probe"" room, which looked an awful lot like an attic room in someone's house, complete with angled ceiling.  It seems to me that the room had a baseboard, which is somewhat unusual on most spaceships.  Of course, since we are inside a spaceship, there are accoutrements that tell you we are dealing with aliens, including an internally lit ""probe"" table, and a rather simplistic control panel with flashing lights and, of all things, joysticks, each with a rubber boot, one of which controls the probe.  Periodically we see Peter being probed, though there is nothing graphic.

The aliens are all dressed in some kind outfits that are a combination of knit material, rubber or leather, and a shiny faceplate.  The aliens also come with their own, truly obnoxious, sound effects.  Every time the aliens show up, the sound effects kick off, and you quickly wish that the aliens would stop showing up.  We see the aliens from their perspective most of the time rather than wandering about the landscape, except when they are probing Peter in their spaceship.

From this point forward, the movie gets a bit muddled, and there are a number of things that are totally senseless, with occasional ridiculousness.  I almost feel like bullet points are needed here rather than explanations, because the director apparently felt the urge to throw in element after element, without any real purpose.

There are the ""good"" guys, which generally consist of Peter, Karin, a handful of cops, including Martin Balsam, a psychic (who apparently is able to commune with the aliens in some weird, unexplainable way), a UFO expert, and a number of other people.  In general, most of the people are good, or at least are not bad.

Next are the aliens, who seem to be focused on eliminating evidence of their visits.  What is strange is that while they are ""eliminating"" evidence of their visits, they generate more evidence.  You would think that the aliens would realize that they are playing a losing game with all the people and ""evidence"" that they eliminated throughout this movie, all the while leaving behind more witnesses and more evidence, like a big circle where their spaceship landed, which you would think would be more damaging than a few pictures.

Lastly, several hit men types (I think they were called silencers or some similar name) are running around trying to cover up visits by the aliens.  These people appear to think that an optimal solution to covering up visits is to eliminate witnesses, in addition to taking evidence and beating people up.  In typical paranoid fashion, these people are doing all this for the public's protection.  What the movie never explained is who was protecting the public from the silencers.

In general, this movie makes little sense.  I can see the director saying, ""Okay, we want these people to interact with the aliens.  How can we do that?  Oh, yeah, we will have them take pictures of aliens in the woods, which they will not see until the pictures are developed.  Then everyone will be chasing the pictures and Peter can be probed!  What fun!""  The only problem is that with all the bumbling of the military, the police, and even the silencers with the same apparent motivation of the aliens, I had to wonder why the aliens bothered to try to cover up anything.  Even the police had their silly moments, like destroying fingerprints and other evidence.  The people at CSI would be mortified the way crime scenes were treated.  The psychic was ridiculous.  How can we learn something about aliens that will not speak to us?  I know, we can call in a psychic.  They could have saved money by using the psychic hotline.

In spite of the general silliness of the plot, and lack of explanation throughout the movie, this movie does have its moments.  Perhaps the most interesting feature of the movie is that it really tries hard to be a ""serious"" UFO movie.  The movie presents ""facts"" about UFO's and tries hard to take on a mantle of intelligent investigation.  The movie generally does not succeed in the intelligent part, but it does have its interesting moments.

I am going to recommend this movie to a very small audience, but cautiously.  If you enjoy movies about sentient aliens running about the landscape trying to cover up their existence, with some sort of absurd government agency helping them in the cover up (and eliminating people with little motivation), albeit independently of each other, then this movie could be for you.  Yes, this movie is low budget.  Yes, many things in the movie either make no sense, or are completely illogical.  In spite of the flaws, something about this movie makes it worth one watch, particularly if you like inscrutable aliens.

Enjoy!",1357862400,,5783,4.836215666327568
8159079,3,B000KU7WX8,"A puzzling little piece, so chopped up, so cliche-ridden, with such bad into-English dubbing and such poor picture quality that at times it's hard to follow, but for some reason I can't really pin down, it held my interest to the end.  I expect it was the nostalgia of every bad European sf film of the 60s-70s that I ever saw, rolled into one.  I wouldn't say it was a quality film - quite the reverse - but it was entertaining in its way.",1256256000,,440,4.226190476190476
8159080,3,B000KU7WX8,"Okay, objectively speaking, this may be a bad film, but ... it's got ""something.""  It's certainly unique.

The story concerns a photographer who's abducted by a UFO.  So is his model, but not before she gives some photo negatives of the aliens to a reporter.  The reporter investigates the abduction.  So do the cops.  Meanwhile, ""the Silencers"" -- an international secret police force of Men In Black -- try to steal the negatives from the reporter.  Curiously, the aliens are also attempting to cover their tracks by stealing the negatives and killing witnesses

Although EYES BEHIND THE STARS was released around the time of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, it seems more inspired by those 1970s Sunn Classics feature documentaries.  The ones about UFOs, and ancient astronauts, and the Bermuda triangle.  Much of EYES BEHIND THE STARS is just characters reciting facts about Project Blue Book and various abductions and investigations.

An end credit scroll tells us that all the quotes concerning military and investigative officials are factual.  The writer/director even touts his membership in UFO investigation societies in the opening credits.  Rather than a conventional story arc, the plot is more an attempt to string together some UFO lectures, as our reporter hero interviews a UFO expert, then teams up with him to solve the UFO dilemma.  An Air Force officer debates government policy with a Man In Black, going over theories of censorship and the potential of public panic if the truth of UFOs was revealed.

It's almost like watching a cheaply made, dramatized, UFO documentary.  Its seriousness mirrors THE X-FILES, although its reporter hero may be likened to a more polished KOLCHAK.

The film was shot in Italy, yet is set in England.  All the dialog seems dubbed into English.  American actor Martin Balsam is the biggest star, yet his dialog is also dubbed, by an actor with a vaguely Scottish accent.  Which is curious, because none of the other ""English"" characters have British accents of any kind.

The aliens are a poor man's Gray.  Their look evokes Grays, but not explicitly.  The aliens are just full-sized actors in full body suits (thermal underwear?) with blue faceplates.  So we don't see the aliens' faces.  Well, that's one way to save on the budget.

In traditional Italian film fashion, when our hero reporter learns he's been betrayed by a woman, he slaps her around.  But it's so poorly photographed, we can tell his hands never come close to striking her face.

Toward the end, the reporter and UFO expert bring in a psychic to make contact with an abductee lying in a coma.  Sure, why not?

The ending itself is dark and unexpected.  Very nasty and conspiratorial.

Yeah, it's a shoddy film, but it's unique, and it has a funky 1970s attitude.  I enjoyed it.  The abduction scenes are not as scary as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fire-in-the-Sky/dp/B0002V7O3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fire in the Sky</a>, yet EYES BEHIND THE STARS is spooky at times, if one has the lights turned low, and is in the right frame of mind.

I first saw EYES BEHIND THE STARS on VHS.  I later bought this DVD copy.  It's full screen, with no special features.  And lots of grain and washed-out colors.  It looks like this DVD was struck from the VHS, which in turn was struck from an old TV film print.  But hey, with new DVD copies selling at a penny a piece on Amazon, you can't very well expect it to be digitally remastered.

The Italians made some wonderfully trashy-fun sci-fi films in the 1970s.  Apart from THE HUMANOID (my favorite STAR WARS ripoff -- better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/StarCrash/dp/B000B5H2J6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">StarCrash</a>), I especially recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Visitor-1979/dp/6304140061/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Visitor (1979)</a>, which combined elements of demonic possession, UFOs, antichrist films, evil children, and Hari Krishna type alien warriors for good.",1175126400,5,4106,5.4116719242902205
