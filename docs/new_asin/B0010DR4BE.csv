8237726,3,B0010DR4BE,"Comparable to Lock Stock & Barrel, or Snatch.  Lock, Stock.. would have been 4 star in my book whereas Snatch with or without B Pitt was still about 3 for me but that movie had its fans and if you were one of them you may like this as well.  The acting is kind of low budget and over-exaggerated.  Lots of violence, with a slightly humorous edge.  The story, which initially attracted me to the movie, is better in synapsis than actual viewing experience I thought, but again, depends what you like.  I've got friends that really liked ""Snatch"".  Irish accents are thick (no subtitles on this U.S. edition) but it's understandable enough.",1302134400,,638,4.601769911504425
