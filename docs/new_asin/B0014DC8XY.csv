3129811,5,B0014DC8XY,"Steve Rodby's presentation of The Pat Metheny Group concert in California's Mountain winery,captures the group in one of the most intense concerts I've seen on disc. The sound is really amazing ,in it's DTS setting and captures the surrounding atmosphere in great detail.***** Buy this Dvd ,you will not be disappointed! Oh,it's a movie of a concert,enjoy.

3129812,5,B0014DC8XY,"Even if your familiar with Pat Metheny, it's still unbelievable. This an outstanding performance by a group of artists. His opening solo just blew away! I've never seen or heard any thing like it, a 4 neck guitar?? This would be so awesome on Blu-ray in DTS Master Audio, I hope they do it soon! This is Sooooo recomended to any Pat Metheny, Jazz or music fan of many tastes that I can't express enough how much you should own this. It makes all my other 5's look like 3's and 4's.

I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker,  more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.*****
2.*****
3.*****

Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard Audio or Video quality recordings and rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.",1268870400,8,1161,4.5625
3129813,5,B0014DC8XY,"I knew of Pat Metheny through the 1980s but never listened to him until I bought the 'Imaginary Day' CD in 1998. As a result I luckily saw that tour in 1998 in Richmond, Va. The show was simply...beautiful and vivid. I always wished that a DVD existed of that night...and just stumbled across this one with Dolby Digital and DTS.

This 1998 show at what looks like the Paul Masson winery in California captures that time perfectly. As I sit in front of my home theater I have my 4-week old daughter in my arms and she is mesmermized by the sound...her first musical experience. I'm biased and not going to write a long review except to say this is a 5-star DVD to me...because it appears my little girl is as astonished by Pat and his band as I was 12 years ago. Thanks guys...

*This appears to be re-release of the 2001 out-of-print DVD. Yes the video can be grainy in some darkly lit tunes but given the venue in 1998 it's par for the course. Some reviews on the original DVD didn't like the occasional split-screen matting. I never noticed it until I read the reviews.",1263513600,8,1072,4.355

(tip: get the vastly superior ""the way up"" video.)",1509580800,,380,4.890625

8255294,2,B0014DC8XY,"Let me start by saying I am a total Pat Metheny Group devotee - I have all of their available live DVD's. The music in this DVD is, as always, awesome but it seems like Steve Rodby was having fun with the video effects and it really gets in the way of the experience. Lots of places where there are four small views running at once, lots of visual effects for no apparent reason. It was very frustrating.",1379980800,6,404,4.1923076923076925
8255295,5,B0014DC8XY,"This filmed 1998 concert is only available on DVD as near as I can determine.  The concert features 11 numbers, all but two written by Metheny and his regular collaborator and keyboard artist Lyle Mays.  The other two are Metheny compositions.  As a longtime fan of Metheny that dates back to the 1970's, this grouping has always been a favorite.  Joining M & M are Jeff Hayes on percussion, Philip Hamilton and Mark Ledford with backup vocals and various instruments and Paul Wertico on drums.  Steve Rodby completes the group on acoustic and electric bass.  Rodby also is credited as director, editor and writer!  The group is in great form on this outdoor setting at The Mountain Winery in Saratoga, CA.  Metheny is impressive as usual, especially when he takes on that synth guitar with two necks and a harp-like cord setup.

Unfortunately the video of this concert film is a bit off-putting.  First of all the aspect ratio is mostly the squarish 1.33:1.  I say mostly because there are a number of scenes where the screen is stretched wider and has double and sometimes 4 images.  There is one sequence where Metheny is highlighted in a tight vertical frame.  All that trickery is forgivable but the poor lighting causing scenes of white floaters against the black backdrop and is a bit fuzzy even on closeups.  Even my Oppo had a hard time presenting this DVD.  The sound fortunately is excellent given the limited lossy options.  The DTS 5.1 surround option is the best bet although Dolby Digital 5.1 and Pro Logic stereo is available.",1370649600,,1542,4.7622641509433965
8255296,5,B0014DC8XY,"This is a must own for Matheny Group fans, I saw this concert in 1997 right after the release of Imaginary Day & this DVD is a solid memory down that path. The visuals & sound quality are superb.",1368316800,,195,4.0256410256410255
