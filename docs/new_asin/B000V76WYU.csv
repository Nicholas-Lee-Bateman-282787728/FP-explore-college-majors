8325808,1,B000V76WYU,"Leaving aside the difficulties of enjoying an acoustic set by a bar band know for anthemic rock, this DVD is worthless.
To begin, the camerawork was insufferable. I was unaware of the earthquake occurring in New York City on the day in question. There were only two camera angles: a wide shot from a fixed camera and a handheld for pickup shots. Either give the camerman a tripod for the pickup shots or package the DVD with Dramamine.
Second, the local high school AV club appeared to be otherwise occupied that day, because the camera operator on the pickup shots had trouble framing the action, and often seemed to have trouble finding the action.
Third, the director's choice of using wide shots -- and even one cutaway -- of people leaving during the set was an interesting choice. I'm glad I was able to see a man in pressed, pleated khakis walk away during the middle of the song. Perhaps the existential drama of this shot escaped me.
Fourth, the video transfer appears to have used two VHS machines -- perhaps even MII. There are obvious digital hits and I even thought I saw tape wrinkle. That's right, tape wrinkle on a DVD. Next time perhaps they could use a 1980s Camcorder and shoot the video off a TV screen.
In sum, don't buy it. It was amateur hour at a professional price.",1241136000,3,1290,4.540772532188841
8325809,3,B000V76WYU,"This is a terrific little low key performance. Good sound quality and featuring many of the bands rockinest numbers stripped back to a semi acoustic sit down showcase standard.

The video direction however is less than inspirational. A two or three static camera set up and plenty of long shots of a daylight performance. Shine A Light this aint, but as a document of a hot band at an one off event playing killer tunes... It's good.",1215648000,3,433,4.623376623376624
8325810,1,B000V76WYU,"I should have known something was fishy when the product description was so uninformative.  I am a big fan of this band and they always satisfy live in my experience, but this UNPLUGGED show was ill-advised at best. Craig's shtick just does not work under these conditions; it's like a poetry slam or something.  Very disappointing.",1205280000,3,332,4.910714285714286
