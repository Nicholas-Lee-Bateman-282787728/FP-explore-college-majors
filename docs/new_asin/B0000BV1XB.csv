7998035,4,B0000BV1XB,"UPDATE: Dec. 4,2016

I upgraded this DVD from 2 to 4 stars;here's why:

I was previously unimpressed by the fireplace and still am; the picture is not HD and the overall look isn't as professional as more modern DVDs. BUT, I did notice (in the 90 min.) that the logs move a bit as the fire consumes them; it would have been better to let the fire die out to it's ambers.

Funny thing though, I was first put off by the music, (btw, contrary to what another reviewer wrote, there ARE 34 songs: 20 vocals and
14 instrumentals; I know, I actually counted them yesterday)...the singing is amateurish (Choirs of adults, often children doing a decent job); I'm convinced this was recorded in a church or concert hall; there is a slight echo throughout; but I started to like the music Because it's fairly good, it reminds me of midnight mass when I was a kid; there are many religious undertones (which isn't bad), and it varies from Choir to Instrumentals, from church style to more modern during the 90 min.; there's even a part where the adult choir sings  the horribly long ""12 days of Christmas"" going faster and faster as if to get it out of he way and the audience first laughs and then applauds; that's the only time you hear an audience; but after being used to more modern high tech soundtracks, this is actually a refreshing change, huge variety in styles, from serious to more lively, it grows on you when you just let it run and do other things; I thought I was going to put this DVD in the trash but now I'm more and more 'seduced' by the less polished but very heartfelt singing and intermittent instrumental pieces; yesterday I decided to play it all and I didn't get bored; you may know the name of the song coming up from the list on the back cover (see my scan) but you don't know if it will be standard, religious-isch or happy and upbeat.

If you want the more modern HD perfect ( I have a whole collection) pictures and snazzy instrumentation, then this is not for you; but if you feel like an 'old time' type of concert, varied and rather prolific (34 SONGS), then you'll have fun with this DVD; and seeing that I only paid a dollar, I can't complain... plus I'm happy to keep it in my collection. It's fun overall.",1479859200,,2232,4.381642512077295

7998039,1,B0000BV1XB,"Well, it IS 90 minutes long, that's the good news.  We might have enjoyed this CD, but our opinion was colored by frustration at the notes which indicated that, of the 34 tracks, 14 are instrumentals, but that is untrue.  Only 8 are actually instrumentals.  We were anticipating a healthy mix of vocals & instrumentals, so we were disappointed. Hard to tell if we would have liked this CD better if the notes had not set us up for a letdown.  We played 'The Happy Holiday Hearth' and Kenny G's 'The Greatest Holiday Classics/The Yule Log' instead, and greatly enjoyed both of those.",1390176000,,582,4.621359223300971
7998040,5,B0000BV1XB,"My husband's original copy of his sacred Christmas Yule Log DVD somehow ended up damaged, making him very unhappy just before the Christmas Holidays began...He was thinking there was no way he could ever find a replacement, as he's had this one for many years...He loved the Grapics in it, (the falling snow, the Moon-Lit night, the smoke from the fireplace, the Beautifully Lit Christmas Tree, among other things)...I was very fortunate that Amazon still had this DVD around, and it was exactly the one that he wanted...needless to say, I ordered it for him, we received it promptly, and had another fantastic Family Christmas this year!  Thank you!",1266624000,,650,4.963302752293578
7998041,5,B0000BV1XB,"For those of you that recall watching the ""original"" yule log on TV, you're going to love the way this is done.  It contains 90 minutes of excellent quality Christmas music (mix of both Instrumental and Vocal). It has a total of 34 popular songs.  You can pick between the yuletide log video (which has numerous fireplaces that change periodically) or a really nice ""snowfall"" winter scene.  Both play the same music in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound.  This video was designed for standard NTSC resolution so those with High Definition TVs may want to look for something else.

Get it while you can because this DVD is already discontinued at various other locations (I suspect because newer high definition videos have taken its place).",1197763200,7,739,4.88
7998042,5,B0000BV1XB,"This is an fun hostess gift for your friends and loved ones with a healthy sense of humor and kitsch! At just $5.00 each, it's an affordable little stocking stuffer, plus you won't have to clean the fireplace! It has the close-up, fireplace view, as well as the ""looking at your neighbor's house as the snow falls"" view. The music is traditional and really lovely, or you can just hit ""mute"" and enjoy the scenes. Perfect when wrapping or opening presents!",1197590400,3,456,4.6419753086419755
