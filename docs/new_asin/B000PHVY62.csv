8191420,3,B000PHVY62,"I had watched this cartoon when I was a kid. The donkey is main character in this movie which makes this version of nativity story very different and difficult to follow. The movie is maliciously violent for children. A scene where two soldiers graphically talking about killing baby Jesus. The King Herod of the movie is shown as a sadistic and do anything to kill the child including using the wisemen to disclose the child's location and the parents and flash arms showing mothers and children being harmed. The movie is rated G but, I do not recommend this cartoon to young or sensitive children.",1450915200,,600,4.723809523809524
8191421,5,B000PHVY62,"My family and I watched this movie every year in December when I was growing up. Somehow, the VHS got lost and for several years, we have missed our annual Christmas tradition. I was so happy when I found this on DVD! The animation is obviously simple as it is an old movie, but it still looks great. The story is wonderful. I am happy to have this back in my yearly holiday lineup.",1417478400,2,382,4.175675675675675
8191422,1,B000PHVY62,I don't like the non-Biblical additional storyline.,1405036800,,51,6.428571428571429
8191423,5,B000PHVY62,We have loved this version of the Christmas Story for years we have the tape version and wanted the DVD since we only have a DVD player now.  We showed this to REP classes and family everyone enjoys it.,1388016000,,202,4.17948717948718
8191424,1,B000PHVY62,"My review is based on the first half of the movie only, as I didn't make it past that point. We wanted a visual representation of the Christmas story to show our preschool daughter. While this one has accurate characters and some details, it also add many really bizarre details that I feel detract from the actual biblical story. We ended up turning off the movie because we didn't want our daughter catching on to the inaccurate and meaningless details. I would not recommend this version at all.",1387929600,,498,4.670454545454546
8191425,3,B000PHVY62,"I bought this simply because I watched it as a child in the 90's. The movie was just as I remember it, quirky and whimsical, but overall okay. However, I went to take the DVD out of the case and it snapped. I ordered a replacement and the problem does not seem to be present anymore. Hopefully this one lasts.",1385942400,,309,4.166666666666667
8191426,4,B000PHVY62,"An interesting take on the story of the birth of Jesus. Not state of the art animation and no big stars or flashy script but somehow, it keeps your interest. I enjoyed it and so did my 8 year old. As noted in another review, much of the story is from the perspective of an old donkey, which actually adds to the story. A new treat we discovered to enjoy during the holidays.",1324080000,2,374,4.136986301369863
8191427,2,B000PHVY62,"I can't decide if I liked this DVD or not. The animation from 1994 leaves a lot to be desired compared to the fantastic CGI of today. And the dialogue was a little... how shall I say... canned. But I really didn't mind that it was basic. That's what I was looking for: something basic for my preschool age children.

What I didn't like was that it was a little too intense. The story, told from a donkey's perspective, seems to be more focused on King Herod and his jealousy than on Jesus himself. The film starts with the villainous Herod and keeps going back to his murderous intent on Jesus life. Of course they don't ""show"" anything, but the terrified mothers and the vicious looking soldiers raising their weapons were enough to give you a good picture of what happened in Bethlehem and why Jeremiah prophesied that there would be great weeping there.  The story then follows Joseph and Mary as they take their child to Egypt to protect him from assassination. I can't remember ever seeing a film portray the time Jesus spent in Egypt and, as an adult, I enjoyed this segment of the film quite a bit. I feel like it gave me a better perspective on who Jesus was. (One of Rich Mullin's final uncut songs comes to mind: ""My Deliverer"" on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jesus-Record/dp/B000028CGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jesus Record</a>. Terrific stuff.) Even so, it was too much for my kids. A good chunk of the film's 45 minutes was ""scary"" for them. Not how I want them to remember their first nativity movie.

Now that I think about it, this DVD follows Matthew 2 very closely. Nothing wrong with that. It's just not the gentle Luke 2 version to which we are more accustomed. Maybe I need to change my perspective. The Bible deals with reality and reality is that Jesus did threaten Herod's world, and ultimately He rocks the world of every person. Like CS Lewis noted in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe-The-Chronicles-of-Narnia/dp/0060764899/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (The Chronicles of Narnia)</a>, ""Safe?...Who said anything about safe? Course he isn't safe. But he's good. He's the King, I tell you.""

Still, I think I'll wait until my kids are a little older before we use this DVD again.",1197504000,12,2372,5.217847769028872
