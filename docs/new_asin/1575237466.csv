195852,1,1575237466,"This  is  by  far  the  sloppiest  mystery  I  have  ever  seen.  The  biggest  mistake  was  having  a  LITTLE  GIRL  be  the  main  character.  HOW  ANNOYING!  The  acting  is  bad  almost  all  around  and  the  script  dies  in  ignorance  before  the  movie  ends.  It  also  has  plenty  of  plot  holes(needless  to  say).  For  one  thing  I  have  a  very  hard  time  believing  that  some  dumb  little  girl  could  figure  out  a  whole  complex  mystery.  Another  one  was  if  Westing  was  posing  as  3  different  people,  when  the  dumb  little  girl  reported  him  dead,  the  medical  examiners  would  know  that  he  was  still  alive,  and  the  film  dodges  scenes  like  that  for  you  not  to  notice.  But  I  did  and  was  very  confused.  I  mean  WTF?.  And  that  ""queen  sacrifice""  sublot  was  way  bitz.
  The  only  way  I  could  reccomend  this  movie  is  if  you  are  home  alone  and  feel  like  ""Hey,  I  want  to  watch  a  complex  mystery  that  bedazzles  me  with  stupidity"".  Watch  it  if  you  are  in  that  mood.

195853,3,1575237466,"I watched this movie at school after reading the book. The Westing Game is being protrayed pretty poorly in this movie. It seems that much of the complex story line of the book had to be cut out for the movie format. Also, the Turtle in the movie could have done a better acting job. Many of the characters have changed and many have been omitted. However, I must give some credit to some aspects of the movie, because it is always difficult to create a book into a movie and keep the flavor of it. However, this movie is just short of par and could have been done better. However, if you're a fan of the Westing game, it's good to see the movie at least once.",1010534400,3,660,4.1640625

195886,4,1575237466,"Lindsay Lohan is a very good actress. Not many think of her in that light. We tend to see her as another teen trouble maker in/out of rehab. She truly knows her craft & I respect her for that.

I live in the middle of many movie studios (Cali) so my cable has a ridiculous number of channels. We have 3 PBS channels. The nice part is that I get to see movies quicker than others.

This movie was light and cute but definitely geared towards a young crowd. I would buy this movie if I had kids from 10 - 13. Maybe even a bit younger. Since it's a detective movie preteens would be able to keep up with the clues.

I've seen all her movies. My favorite hands down is ""Georgia Rule"".&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Georgia-Rule-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000T988I8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Georgia Rule (Widescreen Edition)</a>

Directed by Garry Marshall you can never go wrong. He knows his stuff. Georgia Rule was a stretch for him in that it spans 3 generations of women with ALL the emotional triggers and real life situations.

195888,4,1575237466,"I know this is a Disney movie for a certain audience but I have to say I rented it one night and really liked it. My reading choices are all very serious so I like a break when I put on a dvd. I appreciated the charm of this movie but what I noticed that I like a lot is how it has the feeling of a play in the writing. I felt like I was watching a decent high school production of a story. The acting is quite good in the context of this movie, I think Brenda Song has a long future as a comedic talent.

7798817,3,1575237466,"Basically Lindsay's character is the alpha female of a group of rich kid school kids at an exclusive New York high school who has had an article her editor (a male student) rejected for the school paper published in a major newspaper after she sent it there along with a photo.  She's loving the fame and rubbing it in the editor kid who she despises face.  However the subject of her story was two of her teachers secret romance, she overhears them having a fight about it the next day, the female teacher tells the guy ""well she's not going to be the one leaving the school.""  The next day the kids learn he has disappeared.  Is the female teacher a murderer?  Was the male teacher who he claimed to be?  She along with other newspaper class kids including the editor boy she so despises will have to solve this case.

It's a G rated movie so that hampers the possibilities of the plot somewhat. It does follow the predictable life lesson formula of self centered girl will learn not to look down her nose at poorer people (in this case people who live in Brooklyn including a homeless man).  That someone you don't like might not be the bad person you assume them to be.  It also has the obvious diverse casting Disney do of a white male and a female lead and all the sidekick minor characters being one from each race.",1489881600,,1322,4.385245901639344
