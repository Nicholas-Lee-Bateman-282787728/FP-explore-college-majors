7846332,4,6303427189,"First of all, this is not the Jack Holt version of the Zane Grey's Man of the Forest so don't believe what you read here.  It is the Randolph Scott version.  The print is decent, but it had tracking problems in certain areas.  Otherwise it would have been excellent.  This is, however, a very well done, produced, and enjoyable Western enhanced by the fine direction of Henry Hathaway.  It is full of surprises and makes interesting use of a number of mountain lions in a unusal telling of a familar story.",1154995200,2,506,4.516483516483516
7846333,4,6303427189,"Wonderful movie for anyone how enjoys the old west!  Very good plot line except people apparently hadden't figured out how to edit very well yet!  Exciting climax!  Lots of gunfighting and a good old fashion kidnapping.
Enjoy Your Movie!",984009600,,237,5.0256410256410255
