1684654,4,B000062XDL,"Having just watched Set 1, I didn't expect a whole lot of evident changes in PETER GUNN SET 2.  Set one contained the first sixteen episodes of the private eyes series from 1958, Set 2 episodes seventeen through thirty-two.  Peter Gunn (Craig Stevens) still hangs out and headquarters at Mothers, the smoky jazz club run by the imposing Mother (Hope Emerson.)  Gunn's girlfriend Edie (Lola Albright) is still huskily breathing out torch songs and melting butter at ten feet.  And Herschel Bernardi as Police Lt. Jacoby is still tucked underneath fedora and trenchcoat, every ready to collaborate with Gunn in solving crimes.

 Still, I enjoyed the second set more than the first.  The first set seemed to be aiming at some kind of gritty realism, and most of the stories took place on the docks, the pier, or the abandoned warehouse.  They missed, and in place of realism they seemed over-populated with dingy locales and Poverty Row-worthy plots and characters.  The episodes in the second set seem to breathe a little more.  It helps that the locations are comparatively exotic - a Texas cattle ranch, an overstuffed antique shop, and the ever reliable carnival midway are just a few of the places where crimes are committed and solved.

 Of course, the music is still great.  After the ultra-cool Cary Grant-lookalike Craig Stevens, the hero of these programs in the Henry Mancini scores.  Well, that and a little more.  `Peter Gunn' has a few repeating characters, the most welcome of which is the 3'9"" Billy Barty and the pool shark (he drags the box he stands on around the table as he surveys his next shot) and sometime informant.  Another treat are the jazz musicians who appear as themselves now and then - included among that crew in this set is drummer Shelly Manne and flamenco guitarist Laurindo Almeida.  There are a few clunkers in the set, of course, but I suppose that's to be expected.  It's hard writing a twenty-five minute crime story.  You have to create the crime, present a handful of likely suspects with plausible motives, and leave enough time for Pete & Edie to sneak away for some sincere snuggling now and then.  In this set of episodes that happens more often than not, and merits a strong recommendation.",1154736000,24,2237,4.806282722513089
1684655,3,B000062XDL,"Novel plots, zany characters and Blake Edwards' superb jazz sound track distinguish this series.  But all told they do not compensate for its lack of other outstanding features nor make it the best of its genre.  Those who love classic TV and/or private investigator/police drama have many other better choices available.",1086393600,4,321,5.2745098039215685
1684656,4,B000062XDL,"Nothing is overdone here.  The acting, the sets, the  music (oh, yes, enjoy the MUSIC) and most of the stories are cool.  Craig Stevens is sublimely in control in the title role, Lola Albright's unspectacular singing voice but unmitigated charm fit into the unspectacular but charming setting of Mother's, the nightclub where Gunn hangs out with her, and Herschel Bernardi is the harried and weary police detective sometimes at odds with Gunn, the private detective.  But how often have you seen that cop/dick relationship overplayed on TV series and in movies.  Here it is understated.  That is not to say the show is so low-keyed as to be boring.  There are mysteries, there's humor (including an episode in which the immaculately tailored Gunn is scurrying about town with a trained seal in tow), and a good rock 'em sock 'em fight every episode.  And all this is surrounded and united by the brilliant Mancini music.  You will have fun and won't get tired even if you watch a bunch of episodes at one sitting.",1074384000,9,1013,4.775862068965517
1684657,5,B000062XDL,"A great experience in life: all that mystery involved in a ""film noir"" crime scene. The splendor of the ""Peter Gunn"" series, one of the most wonderful and famous TV series. And the music of Mancini setting the scene! It's a treasure! It's a perfect demo of how to prepare our hearts and minds with music for a movie scene. Mancini is a master forever. This package is very worth of the impact of watching to the complete series at a time or at least half of it. There are volumes 1 and 2. Buy both for the complete series.",1053129600,10,522,4.23
1684658,5,B000062XDL,"Forty years old and still high quality entertainment. The quality
of the images and sound are better than we ever saw or heard on those primitive TV sets of the 60's. The acting is clearly for fun and the dialog is laced with good comedy moments. The talent of Blake Edwards, Henry Mancini, the actors and musicians, is clearly on display. You will watch it again and again. Whenever there is nothing worth watching on the networks or dish we enjoy Peter Gunn all over again.",1050883200,11,475,4.534883720930233
1684659,5,B000062XDL,"This the coolest TV series ever and the episodes are great on this DVD package.  I know that the tape to DVD transfers could have been done a little better, at least in the soundtrack dept. however, the sound is really not bad, just a little hissy now and then.  But who's complaining?? The picture quality is very good and the acting and the action are second to none.  This is great stuff.  I have an older Peter Gunn VHS box set with 10 episodes which were transferred quite poorly and in the SLP mode.  The DVD release trashes that set but I treasure the VHS set anyhow.  I don't know why this series was never on TV when I was growing up (b. 1965) but it should have been.  I found a cd of the Peter Gunn music by Henry Mancini 11 years ago and REALLY dug the cool jazz on it but never saw and episode untill the VHS set came out a couple of years ago.  And it still has not been re-released into syndication for broadcast.  I recall about 5 or 6 years ago it was on Direct TV but was soon taken off and I never saw it there either.  What gives?  Detective shows hardly get any cooler than this and Craig Stevens, and all the regular and guest actors were some of the best of their time.  I fail to understand how this series could have gone out of popularity yet, the  Lucille Ball show has played straight through since its inception fer cryin out loud!  Get this set and you'll be amazed.  I can't wait to get the 1st set now!!",1018051200,22,1435,4.111510791366906

1684705,5,B000062XDL,"I was so impressed with the two sets of Peter Gunn (which still doesn't cover the entire 38-episode first season), that I wrote to A&E five years ago asking, ""Where is the rest?""  That includes seasons two and three. I have yet to receive a reply.  Sad, us Peter Gunn fans are treated like this.

This set, most of the second half of that opening season, is very good. I think the stories got better and better, which is why I'd give anything to see the rest of this series.

It's not easy to a condense a film noir story into just 25 minutes of a TV show, but the writers did an admirable job. Having the ultra-cool Craig Stevens in the title role and the drop dead-gorgeous Lola Albright as his girlfriend was inspired casting.  So, too, was having the opposite end of the glamor spectrum as the other two main characters: Hope Emerson as ""Mother"" and Herschel Bernardi as ""Lt. Jacoby.""  The four of them were always fun to watch.

The music of Henry Mancini is spectacular and the ""beatnik"" language of the day also is a hoot to hear (""Like, crazy, daddy!"")

Like.....please give us the rest of the series, A&E!",1262131200,,1114,4.426470588235294

1684707,5,B000062XDL,"This is a great example of this genre. An hour long would have been better,allowing for longer plot development. If you are a Mopar fan,you'll love all the Chrysler products of the time. The jazz soundtrack is superb and the fine peformances of all the guest stars is a treat indeed. Lola Albright's recurring role as a singer/girl friend is excellent. In comparison,set 1 has better written stories,considering the half hour format prevalent in the fifties.",1247011200,2,458,5.0394736842105265
1684708,5,B000062XDL,"I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST ""DISCOVERED"" ""PETER GUNN"". I WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN THEN. AT THAT TIME I WAS TUNING IN EVERY WEEK TO WATCH RERUNS OF ""PETER GUNN"". I WAS VERY EXCITED WHEN I LEARNED IT WAS AVAILABLE TO OWN ON ""DVD"". WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW NOW IS WILL THE REMAINING EPISODES EVER BECOME AVAILABLE?  MY THING ABOUT SOME OF THESE ""OLD TELEVISION SHOWS"" IS ONLY SOME OF THE EPISODES ARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE, LEAVING US FANS DANGLING AND HOPING FOR THE REST. I PURCHASED BOTH OF THE ""PETER GUNN"" SETS IN 2005. AND I'M STILL WAITING TO SEE WILL THERE BE A VOLUME 3 AND OR 4. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW MANY EPISODES THERE WERE? ""PETER GUNN"" IS SO COOL.

1684709,5,B000062XDL,"Enough said. It looks like the writers of Mad Men have seen many Peter Gunn shows. I like both and like to pick put some errors in MM regarding  furniture etc. Peter Gunn is the standard for many other shows that followed. I love the way each show starts. A hock, then the plot. Simple and very cool. The deep voice comes from smoking too much. I love Peter Gunn.",1225670400,2,363,4.185714285714286
1684710,5,B000062XDL,"Like most baby boomers who watched this show, we remember the theme song.
What a treat to find these two editions on sale & purchase them. It's the Maltese Falcon/James Bond character, played by Craig Stevens, rolled into one. The plots vary in quality, as do the tranfers of this product. But, that's not what matters--it's the style, era, sets, music & the hot(for it's time)chemistry between Mr Stevens & his gal, played by Lola Albright. It's like stepping back into the hip coolness of light jazz, big cars, the whole era of the late 50's. I wasn't aware of the major influences of the beatniks until seeing this show. Stereotyped, but now informed of the contributions they don't get credit for. I wish they would release Surfside 6, 77 Sunset strip, Mr. Lucky & others in this field. Anybody who wants to remember the golden age of real detective shows would enjoy these two volumns--1 & 2. BUY!!!",1206662400,7,904,4.6918238993710695
1684711,4,B000062XDL,"I bought both season one and two of Peter Gunn, both because it sounded like something I would enjoy, myself, but also because we are caring for my aged mother.  She is bed bound and there is not much on TV these days that she finds entertaining.

These episodes have been a great find for us.  Each one finds a new situation, interesting characters, some wonderful jazz, and a great deal more humor than I had expected.  (Not ""fall in the floor laughter"" but very amusing and lovable characters, and some very challenging and entertaining situations for both Gunn and his police lieutenant pal, Jacobi.)

If you love really good jazz (by some wonderful guest entertainers), and good character development, you should find the Peter Gunn series (both seasons) a real forgotten treasure.",1179187200,4,786,4.879699248120301
1684712,5,B000062XDL,This is a great series from the late fifties.  Done well.  I think anyone would enjoy this.,1178409600,3,91,4.294117647058823
1684713,5,B000062XDL,"Long before Crockett and Tubbs, before Magnum and Dan Tanna, and before Tony Franciosa as Matt Helm or Mike Conners as Mannix, there was Peter Gunn. He was cool. He was the guy every girl wanted and every guy wanted to be like. He lived in a cool world of jazz and bad guys, and girls who needed his help. He had a cool and sexy girlfriend, a little on the sweet side. Some of his friends, like Lt. Jacoby, were squares. It somehow made Gunn even cooler, that you didn't have to be cool yourself to be his pal.

Craig Stevens was Peter Gunn and Lola Albright was his girl, Edie Hart. Hershel Bernardi was his cop pal Lt. Jocoby. Hope Emerson was ""Mother."" She ran the jazz joint Gunn frequented. Blake Edwards was the guy who dreamed up Peter Gunn in the first place. By accident, he ran into a guy by the name of Mancini while getting his hair cut, and the music Mancini would write for Gunn would change television forever. It would also begin a long and fruitful friendship that would give moviegoers and music lovers such classics as ""Days of Wine and Roses"" and ""The Pink Panther.""

While there is an occasional washed out look to these black and white episodes, the convenience of having so many great episodes on the two discs sort of makes up for the occasional lack of quality. While the first boxed set offered some great episodes, including ""Lynn's Blues,"" which I feel is the best of the series, the second boxed set is actually more colorful.

While Mancini's West Coast jazz score and the noirish tone continued, the locations  offered Gunn a chance to roam a bit, as the show got even better. Craig Stevens will always have a special place in TV history as the very cool, Peter Gunn. This show broke new ground in television for its blend of music and action, and set a tone for what cool really was. This is a must have for ""Peter Gunn"" fans and anyone else who loves classic television. There may indeed not be much that's new here, but that is only because Craig Stevens as Peter Gunn started it all.",1158278400,23,2018,4.402144772117962
1684714,5,B000062XDL,"As my review of volume one went, this is classic tv from the golden age.  Short concise plots with good characters make this fun and entertaining.  From the beginning, this show was great.  Throw in one of the most famous themes of all times and a cool, very cool, jazz score and that is the icing on the cake.  It is amazing to watch a detective show without a lot of shoot-em-ups, no foul langauge and no overt sexuality.  Not that those elements are gone entirely, they are done with style.",1155427200,,493,4.373626373626373

7957834,3,B000062XDL,"It's hard to believe how much times have changed.  When I was a boy and this show was a hit it seemed so exciting and mysterious to me.
I just watched about 8 of these and I can't believe I used to get excited when it was time for Peter Gunn on TV.
It is so definitely the 1950s; the cars, the tie, the music, but more than anything the terrible video quality and the horrible audio with Peter Gunn speaking
softly, then a blast of music so loud I had to turn down the volume.  Still there are hints of a ""Mike Hammer-type"" experience.  I would not compare it
with the Stacy Keach 1984s series of Mike Hammer; that would not be fair as time, talent, and technology has improved so much.  However, I can still
say, even though this is the 1950s, and the technology wasn't what it is today, the audio and video quality are poor.  I have other programs from this
time period that have much better audio and video.  Some of the shows in the series are fairly entertaining, though.  I'll give it 3 stars because it kind
of led the way for the future shows of its genre to come: shows like Mike Hammer, etc.",1361577600,3,1101,4.18957345971564
7957835,4,B000062XDL,"What is here is good. But I was disappointed that there are episodes missing that are not on Set 1 of Set 2. They just happen to be some of my favorite episodes. Like the one where right after the scene where Peter has received a close shave in a barber shop, the next scene is a lady singing ""Too Close For Comfort"". Also the one featuring a female singer who fakes her own death to escape a man trying to kill her. She is a great singer. I bought the Set 1 and Set 2 mostly for the music.",1299715200,,490,3.91

The plots are a little simple by todays standards but that may be due to the episodes being only 30 minutes as opposed to the 60 minute ones that most have today.  Still, I would recommend this series to all murder mystery fans out there and who also are somewhat driven by nostalgia for this time period.",1281916800,,459,4.573170731707317
7957837,4,B000062XDL,"To begin these are excellent quality episodes that are clean and easy to see. The jazz music in these episode was very cutting edge for it's time and stands up well even today. My only complaint is the way they cut corners trimming out the Peter Gunn logo and music that played as they went to station breaks, and other similar omissions. I have seen some episodes that have gone into public domain that are completely intact,and enjoy them much better in their original format. All that aside these are great shows and will be enjoyed by everyone who loves classic television shows.",1274572800,,583,4.669902912621359
