2442190,3,B000BUE5E6,"THE NUTTY PROFESSOR

Released in 1996 and directed by Tom Shadyac, ""The Nutty Professor"" is a dramedy starring Eddie Murphy as grossly overweight yet good-hearted professor Sherman Klump. In his experiments he develops a potion that turns him into the slim, charismatic Buddy Love who's also, unfortunately obnoxious. While Buddy helps Sherman take down his nemeses (Dave Chappelle), he also messes up his budding relationship with Carla (Jada Pinkett Smith). Larry Miller and James Coburn are also on hand.

Murphy actually has multiple roles, playing the Richard Simmons-like Lance Perkins, as well as Sherman's mother, father, grandmother and brother in the dinner sequences. While I found the Lance Perkins scenes amusing, the dinner scenes largely fall flat, but they do showcase Murphy's talents.

I also didn't care for the flatulence jokes, but I was able to overlook them  and crude jokes in general  and laughed at the many genuinely amusing parts. The movie works because Murphy expertly makes Sherman a sympathetic character. The scene where he shyly asks Carla out is genius; and the scene where their date is destroyed by the standup comic (Chappelle) is honestly saddening. It may not be as good as ""Coming to America"" (1988), but it's better than ""Trading Places"" (1983).

The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

GRADE: B+

=========================

NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS

Released in 2000 and directed by Peter Segal, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps brings back Eddie Murphy as Sherman Klump, grossly overweight professor with a good heart, whos dating a new girl  (Janet Jackson) and still battling with his thin, charismatic alter ego, Buddy Love (also Murphy), although the way Buddy manifests is different. Larry Miller is on hand as the dean of the university while Melinda McGraw plays a representative of a company interested in purchasing a youth-giving potion. Like the first movie, Murphy plays all the adult Klump members (Granny, Mama, Papa and Ernie).

Janet is a superb replacement for Jada Pinkett Smith as Shermans girlfriend and, like the first film, Sherman is a sympathetic character while Buddy Love is charismatic. I might be in the minority, but I wasn't a fan of the two Klump dinner table scenes in the 1996 movie, which explains why I feel this sequel is a drop in quality: There are too many tasteless scenes with the Klumps  not to mention unnecessarily crude scenes in general  and not enough with the best characters, Sherman and Buddy Love. Buddy in particular is mysteriously absent much of the time, which is inexplicable in that he was one of the comedic highlights of the earlier movie.

The way Eddie plays all the different characters is genius and well-executed, but the films simply not as funny as the first one, unless you favor flatulence jokes and vulgar humor in general. The first movie had both, but theres more of it here and less of what was good.

The movie runs 106 minutes and was shot mostly in the Los Angeles area, but also Moore's Crossroads, South Carolina (presumably the opening church scene).

That's not to say that the first ""Nutty Professor"" isn't great because it is.  Eddie Murphy brings every Klump character alive in these two movies and you'll laugh your head off at the situations he gets into yet there are tender, moving moments in both films as well.

My review is intended to warn would-be buyers to stay away from the Franchise Collection DVD containing both movies, one on each side. This DVD may seem like a bargain price-wise, but it's an inferior pressing. Both movies froze up horribly. Right from the start of the Nutty Professor, during the Universal introduction,  it began breaking up. It eventually played, but froze up again later. In the case of the Nutty Professor II, the last scene froze up so badly that it jumped right to the End Credits. I never saw the conclusion of the film. Just to make sure that it wasn't my new Samsung DVD player at fault, I inserted the DVD in my PC and the same thing happened, even worse. Never have I had a DVD so defective. I'm beginning to wonder if the DVD was a pirated pressing. In any case, I ended up ordering the two movies separately through Amazon. Perhaps dual-sided DVDs are just prone to defects.
