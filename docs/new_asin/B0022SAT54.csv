8349653,3,B0022SAT54,"This is an excellent movie and hard to find. Unfortunately it suffers from non-removable imprinted Spanish subtitles over the English track and is missing around ten minutes or more of the actual movie. The entire torture scene where Robert is hung before the great fireplace in the hall is missing, for example. Since the movie is so hard to obtain, I'd suggest the purchase but I hope for an unmodified English version in the future.",1307491200,,435,4.8133333333333335
