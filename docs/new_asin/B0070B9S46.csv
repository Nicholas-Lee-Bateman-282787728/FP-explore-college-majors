5046072,5,B0070B9S46,"I was a hard core Dark Shadows fan as a kid and rushed home from school everyday to watch it, but missed much of the series, so between having to buy collections and getting the ones that netflix has, I am getting to see the entire thing, and loving it. All disks worked well.",1389398400,,276,4.12962962962963
5046073,5,B0070B9S46,"As a teenager, I was hooked on the Dark Shadows series. I would run up the driveway and drop in front of the TV every day to watch Barnabus Collins and the rest of the Dark Shadows characters live through the trials and tribulations of life in Collinwood. Then I would call my friend Debbie and we would rehash every scene! I bought one season so that I could show my kids and my oldest daughter is now hooked! For every occasion (birthday, Christmas, great report card, 5-Mondays in a month, etc.) she begs for a new collection. I protest (a little) and then get them for her because I am enjoying the sheer pleasure she is getting from them. It's like taking a step back in time...",1388620800,2,683,4.34375
5046074,5,B0070B9S46,"I have been buying each of the DVD collections , watching them and selling them . Then, I buy the next one. Just working my way through them. This one was good with the werewolf and additional vampire (Dirk) stories. I do not like Rev. Trask and Laura in this one. Very wicked individuals.",1388275200,,289,4.37037037037037
5046075,5,B0070B9S46,"For the time period and venue, DS has great special effects and make-up!  The story lines borrow from some great classics!  l think the show is the type that one can watch again and again, and pick up something new each time.  The sign of a good show in my opinion.",1386028800,,265,4.1568627450980395

5046077,5,B0070B9S46,Have been watchin all the dark shadows from the beginning after hearing family talk about it during a holiday gathering. It's fun to see the old shows and to hear the actors interviews at the end of each DVD.,1364601600,,208,4.358974358974359
5046078,5,B0070B9S46,"If you are following the Dark Shadows episodes, you need to see this one!  More on Quentin Collins as Barnabas goes back to 1897 to try to free David from possession by Quentin's ghost.  The Cast we've come to know and love are here as different characters.  I especially love Grayson Hall as Magda, the gypsy woman.  It's so different from her role as Dr. Hoffman!  This is a must see!",1359936000,,386,4.380281690140845
5046079,5,B0070B9S46,"I canremember my older sister running home from the bus stop to be sure to see Dark Shadows. I was to young at the time to be interested,but was always intrigued. Its a lot of fun to watch!!",1359504000,,190,4.026315789473684
5046080,5,B0070B9S46,"This disk set is part of the 1897 plotline.  It wraps up one plotline and starts at least 2 others.  I would have loved to watch it straight through, but life interferes.  A really good set of disks.",1355011200,,199,4.184210526315789

5046096,5,B0070B9S46,"Barnabas's journey in 1897 continues as he tries to save David in the future and stop Quentin in the past. I've been re-watching these episodes and they're much better the 2nd time around. This review may contain spoilers! There is plenty going on such as trying to stop Laura the Phoenix from taking Nora and Jamison, Evan Hanley hypnotizing Tim Shaw to kill someone, and most importantly, Quentin has been cursed and becomes a werewolf during the full moon. These are some great and intriguing episodes. There are some dark occult overtones, and I'm surprised they could get away with stuff like that back in 1969. If you love gothic soap operas about witches, vampires, and werewolves, you'll love DARK SHADOWS COLLECTION 14!!!",1402099200,,730,4.943089430894309

8507625,4,B0070B9S46,Love watching these collections..they bring back so many memories of watching them as a kid!  Also enjoy watching the included interviews with those who made the show. Don't want to miss a single episode!  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the pricing which seems to increase with the purchase of each successive collection of episodes.,1443830400,,350,4.915254237288136
