8038183,4,B000644OFW,Nice collection of videos. One drawback is the length of the dvd. It is rather short.,1520985600,,85,4.375
8038184,3,B000644OFW,"BEWARE BEFORE YOU BUY THIS ITEM!!!! Bought this video thinking the music videos would be complete and un-edited. The first song ""MY HAPPY ENDING"" has 2 words cut out of it. I think that's terrible. We should be able to buy an artists music video collection WITHOUT words being cut from their songs. It's very disruptive to the song and it's continuity. The rest of the songs were UNCUT. Still love you though AVRIL!",1342483200,3,415,4.621621621621622
8038185,5,B000644OFW,"As always Avril Lavigne satisfies with a nice collection of a few of her early videos. This was her ""favorites"" at the time which was early in her career. Since then she has put out more CD's and every one of them is great! This is a nice DVD with some music videos that are all great to watch and reminiscent of her early years.",1297814400,2,329,4.076923076923077
8038186,3,B000644OFW,"I just bought this DVD at Wal-Mart today since it was only 5.88$, but I don't understand the purpose of it. Just the title ""My Favorite Videos (So Far)"" is pretty unorganized. It has five videos. My Happy Ending, Don't Tell Me, Sk8er Boi (Live), Losing Grip, Sk8er Boi. I don't understand why they didn't just make two different dvd's, one with videos from her first cd, one with videos from her second, one with live videos. Why a ""favorite video"" DVD? I still enjoyed the few videos that was on it however.",1096761600,15,508,4.473118279569892
