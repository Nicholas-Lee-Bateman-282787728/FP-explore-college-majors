8472809,5,B005HBJBK2,"I give 5 stars for the series. I don't know about this particular presentation.  I used to watch this series when I lived in Honolulu in the 80's (until I moved).  It was subtitled.  The story was touching and fantastic and very well done.  If they'd put the show that I saw on DVDs, for a reasonable price, it would be a runaway best seller.  I'd love to see it again.",1465776000,,369,4.140845070422535
8472810,1,B005HBJBK2,The DVD lacks the subtitles in English and tht it is disheartening!!! It should have been mentioned in the review of the DVD. Plz buyers note that before buying this DVD u have to take a crash course in Japanese.,1428710400,,212,4.325
8472811,3,B005HBJBK2,Can I please inquire whether there is a mandarin version with english subtitle for this series???,1413936000,,97,5.125
8472812,2,B005HBJBK2,The product should claim it is not the full original story!!! There is no explanation of how much is cut and why. I am very disappointed that a Japanese company would sell a heavily cut version of the film.,1376524800,16,206,4.3076923076923075
8472813,1,B005HBJBK2,"This is a wonderful saga of life in late Meiji, Taisho and Showa eras seen through the eyes of a sharecropper farmer's daughter.
It was the most watched program on Japanese TV ever. Only one of the companies advertising this DVD on Amazon.com advises that the DVD they are selling is formatted for Japanese video. Of course, Japanese formatted discs will not play on U.S. formatted DVD players. When I advised the company that I purchased the DVDs from, they said that Amazon did not list the countries where they were advertising the DVDs. Well, that may be, but when they got the order from me, it showed a shipping address of USA, what did they think, I was buying them in the US to play in Japan? I still haven't gotten my refund from them, another two weeks and I am going to be raising cain with Amazon.

I still want to get the DVDs so my wife can see the whole program. If you live in the US and you are interested in late Meiji, Taisho and Showa era life in poor Japan, AND if you get a chance to acquire DVDs formatted for the US AND if you don't understand spoke Niigata dialect and you can get subtitles, get them. It is a very interesting story. The subtitles leave some subtleties out, but generally will make the story easy to follow, but all the dialog is not translated. If you speak some Japanese, it will help you get more of the story, even though much of it is Hokuriku-ben.",1376265600,11,1395,4.324427480916031
8472814,5,B005HBJBK2,"Speedy Japan was excellent. Prompt service. Brand new 2 DVD set. Good value.  Elapsed time was about two weeks from placing order with Japan until receipt. Arigato, Chieko-san!",1362441600,,176,5.285714285714286
8472815,5,B005HBJBK2,"This might be the best tv series ever made in Japan. It is very long but outstanding. Maybe you have to see it for yourself to understand. This series was broadcast in many, many countries. It was even wildly popular in the Middle East. If you could only own one Japanese tv drama, I think this would be it.

It was made during the Showa era, which is really the last generation that wasn't heavily western influenced. Especially in rural areas, foreigners were still a rarity then. It is probably the closest glimpse that many people today can ever get into the Japan of then. For this alone, this series is worth watching. It also recreates the previous era, which due to the memories of older people, it probably captures better than anyone could do today. Just the same as I could paint a picture of the WWII generation in America better than today's youth ever could because of my intimate acquaintance with that generation regardless of the fact that I wasn't alive then.

If you don't speak Japanese, make sure it is subtitled or it won't be very interesting. I think this is more interesting for women and girls than men because it follows the life of a female.",1334275200,19,1169,4.561904761904762
