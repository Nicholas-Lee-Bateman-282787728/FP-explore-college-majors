320127,1,6301169786,"... or so we're told. A pity this is the exception to the rule.

All the elements that made the original Arthur great, especially the one-liners, the cinematic flow and feel of the movie, Arthur's irrepressible personality, and the naturalness of the absurdity, are all disposed.

The replacement is a series of hackneyed scenes, strung together in a formulaic and unbelievable setting. It suggests a film held hostage to its executive producer - the same Moore that was genius in the first movie - attempting to shoehorn a reality play and forced character development into an environment that was so charming due to its lack of either.

Three thumbs down if that is possible.",1125100800,3,677,4.921052631578948
320128,5,6301169786,"Liza Minnelli is actually really funny in this film! It's a great comedy film on it's own - regardless of having ""2"" after it's name. Liza Minnelli looks awesome and is a perfect match for the genius that is Dudley Moore. Has anyone seen Liza Minnelli's brilliant performances in Arrest Development? She's great!",1116460800,2,312,4.90566037735849
320129,5,6301169786,"In 1982,the late Dudley Moore won a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Arthur Bach in the first film. Much of his fellow cast members returned for the sequel. One who didn't was Jill Eikenberry who played Susan Johnson in the first film. Eikenberry,at the time this film was made,was a cast member of the NBC legal drama L.A. LAW. She was unable to reprise the role so Cynthia Sikes filled Eikenberry's shoes. Arthur and Linda(Liza Minnelli) are now married and Arthur lost his mega-fortunes to Susan Johnson's father(Stephen Elliott). Elliott did appear in the first film. One day,Arthur ran into Susan's father while he(the father) was hunting. Arthur is promised his money back on the condition that he divorces Linda and marries Susan. Arthur and Susan almost got married in the first film but Arthur confessed his love for Linda to Susan at the very last minute. At this point,Arthur no longer cared for the money. All he cared about was Linda. Arthur was relentlessly seeking employment and in one scene when he was on his way out,in came Mrs. Canby(Kathy Bates) who runs an employment agency. Arthur was also concentrating on giving up booze. Arthur did find employment as a sales associate at a hardware store but was fired after his first shift. The new owner of the business elected to terminate Arthur,not his/her predecessor. Again,Susan's father is angry because Arthur remained with his loyal wife. Susan,an art gallery owner,forgave Arthur for dumping her in the first film. Susan didn't seem to be upset about Arthur remaining with Linda. In the last scene,Arthur is back in the money. How I love those happy endings! The out-of-print movie soundtrack includes Kylie Minogue's cover of the 1962 Little Eva hit LOCOMOTION. In the scene where Arthur's grandmother(Geraldine Fitzgerald) meets with her personal fitness trainer,she watches him moving around while she sips her tea. Fitzgerald did appear in the first film also. LOCOMOTION also appeared on Minogue's 1988 Geffen Records album,KYLIE. The song was on hit parade in the summer of 1988,during the heatwave of the 20th century. This film was not as successful as the first,so that's why there were no further sequels.",1106697600,14,2193,5.027472527472527
320130,5,6301169786,"""Arthur 2: On the rocks"" was panned when it came out because people were still awash in the heady rush created by the superb ""Arthur"", and anything with a ""2"" in the title that was released in the 80's just had to be bad.

Truth is, this is a fine sequel, one that actually ( a rare trait in 80's sequels) continues the story of Arthur and his bride as they attempt to create a family, and are forced to deal with sudden poverty in the process.

Dudley Moore is in top form, and even Liza Minelli- who generally grates on my nerves- is entertaining here.

Don't let that late 80's cynicism fool you - check out this wonderful little comedy. You'll be pleasantly surprised.

Favorite Line: ""Honey, I'm home. We're poor.""

Oh yeah, this one's a keeper.",1104969600,,750,4.405797101449275
320131,5,6301169786,"This should have been the box office smash that the original was. This is not inferior to the original, by any means. Put bluntly, Arthur 2: On the Rocks has never deserved a pan by any critic. The chemistry between Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli is undeniable. And it is the source of this movie's charm. Their sense of humor is equally matched. You almost get the feeling that Dudley and Liza are just being themselves, instead of acting. Everything between them seems genuine. I suppose their off-screen friendship didn't hurt when making this sequel. John Gielgud reprises his role in the form of a ghost, and those scenes with Arthur are touching. In this movie we learn that money isn't everything. Some things, like being with the one you love, are more important. And this movie has a happy ending. And what is wrong with that? Dudley, you are sorely missed. You left us much too soon.",1104278400,2,893,4.658227848101266

320197,3,6301169786,"This movie was OK.  I was disappointed to discover that Arthur seemed to drink just as heavily 5 years later in the storyline.  You'd think he'd have cirrohosis by now.  Good grief.  He has the girl he loves and all the money in the world.  What is he escaping?  Turns out Burt Johnson, father of the jilted bride from the first movie has a personal vendetta (financial), against him, and thwarts him at every turn, trying to force him into marrying Susan.  Again, despite this, and as in the first movie,  Arthur is committed to his wife and finally approaches Burt and says ""Enough is enough.""  The thing that was hokey to me is the whole adoption scenario.  Arthur needs to quit drinking, which he does late in the film, but I still wonder if he fully appreciates the situation of having to be responsible for another person.  The film ends with the two of them committed to each other and their family, but I have to wonder how Arthur will cope with the day in and day out situation in which he now finds himself.",1419552000,,1017,4.413978494623656

320229,5,6301169786,"The biggest criticism I've seen about this movie is that it's not as funny as the first.  In that regard, the criticism is accurate.  However, as an extension of the story begun in the first movie, this film is superb !!

This movie successfully extends the plot/story from the first film; and it does it in a way that's enjoyable and believable!  This movie has all the elements of a quality film - script, screenplay, camera work, acting . . .  it's all top notch.  And I found it distinctly enjoyable to watch how Arthur transforms into a wholly different person.

If you're looking for the jokes/wisecracks of the first movie, then this may not be for you.  But if you're looking for a continuation of Arthur, and a possible conclusion to the first film, then this is for you.

I highly recommend it!",1371254400,,804,4.527777777777778
320230,5,6301169786,I loved Arthur 2 with that adorable Dudley Moore. The love and warmth in this one is there.

320255,4,6301169786,"I've seen this movie at least three times by now.  I can see why some may say they didn't like this movie.  But I'll have to disagree with them.  I thought Arthur: On The Rocks was actually very good, especially that scene on the stairs with the incredibly old apartment super and the slow-moving, electric chair. Very funny!  The comedy in Arthur 2 reminds me a lot of the classic movies from the 30s and 40s that I like so much.  If it had been made back in the 30s or 40s, I would think David Niven and Ginger Rogers would've been perfect for the lead roles and probably would've won Oscars for them.  So to the sequel-phobic people out there, I say give Arthur 2 one more chance.

320256,1,6301169786,"This 1988 film directed by Bud Yorkin is a sad effort to try to recapture the innoncent charm of the 1981 original. Most of the orginal cast is back except for Jill Eikenberry (who probably knew better!!) and tries to continue the life of Arthur Bock and Linda Merolla (Bock). Vengful Bert Johnson (Stephen Elloit) plots to force Arthur to divorce Linda and marry his prized daughter Susan by taking control of the Bock family fortune. I've never understood what is so funny about a man's life being ruined and his marriage being ripped apart. Dudley Moore tries his best, but after so many bad movies, his audience had grown quite tired of him. Liza Minelli also gives it her best to bring some life and humor to this dreary story. But even her trademark wisecracks and even the ghostly appearence of Hobson (Sir John Geilgud) offer this sinking ship any hope. Actors like Paul Benedict, Jack Gliford and a very young (and at the time unknown) Kathy Bates also try, but ultimately, this film should never have been made. Like so many sequels it's only success is to remind us how good the original was.",1289692800,3,1103,4.63265306122449

This movie has all the same characters including Burt Johnson, Arthurs fiance from the original's father. Burt Johnson is still continually trying to get Arthur to marry Susan. He makes it so Arthur looses his all of his money. Arthur and Linda continually try to find an place to live..Burt gets them thrown out. Arthur tries to get a job...he gets fired because of Burt Johnson. Susan confronts Linda and Linda realizes that they are not going to give up, so Linda gives up fighting for her and Arthur.

I love this movie. Sometime I think that I like it more then the original because it's a more believable story then the original. Its more ""down to earth""

This is a tiresome ""pastiche"" in which Dudley Moore has lost the charms from 1981 and is just plain annoying. This happens with drunks in real life as well....  the charms and fun just escapes them when they reach the middleage and still refuses any kind of commitment...

This is a needless sequel. The only reason it was made must have been because the stars filmcareers had come to a halt... It`s like a tiresome homemovie...

Liza Minelli for one aggravatingly giggles after each line, Dudley Moore guffaws constantly as if each joke is the funniest in the history of the world.
