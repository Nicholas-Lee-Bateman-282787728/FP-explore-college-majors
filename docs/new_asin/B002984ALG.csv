I'm still shaking from watching all 393 mins. of it. Special forces untold stories (top left) by far the best one. Buy multiple copies you won't regret. Plus free shipping!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1319068800,,332,5.283018867924528
8748849,4,B002984ALG,"I recently purchased this DVD at Target for $2.00.  When I picked it up (with several other Echo Bridge 3 - 4 Movie titles) I was not expecting much.  But then again when you are paying less than you would on Amazon.com it is still a great deal.  While most of the DVDs I purchased were only worth 1 watching, this DVD was different.  It includes several stories related to Vietnam and other recent wars (nothing on Afghanistan or Iraq though).  The storytelling, interviews, and dramatizations is excellent.  Definitely worth the purchase if you can get it cheap enough.",1289865600,2,571,4.717171717171717
8748850,1,B002984ALG,"I bought this DVD thinking it was (as the title indicates) about modern warfare. The closest to modern that these documentaries got was the marines training which I'm guessing was filmed in the '90s. It targets missions in Granada, Somalia, Panama, Desert Strom, and Vietnam. Those take place in the '60s, '70s, and '80s. I guess I'm too young for this to be 'modern.' They are descent documentaries that aired on TLC and Discovery Channels. All-in-all I was highly disappointed.",1268956800,3,479,5.0
