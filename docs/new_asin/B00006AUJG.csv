1740484,3,B00006AUJG,"I am not a comic book fan. I have read a few comic books, but not enough to be called a reader, let alone a collector. I was drawn into the premise of this movie, and also believe that Michael Rappaport has the ability to turn dog[doo] into diamonds, no matter what the role. I am also a fan of Donal Logue, and I have an appreciation for culty films like this. As it turns out, the comic book aspect was not too extreme. ""Comic Book Villains"" requires a familiarity for the themes of comic books, rather than the comics themselves. There are three types of comic book 'geeks' in the movie: the hardcore collector, represented by Logue's character; the famous book reader, who knows everything about popular comics, but nothing about less-known ones; and the casual reader, represented by DJ Quall's character of Archie. His role is where the problems begin. Every moment that Logue, Rappaport, or Cary Elwes is on screen, the movie shines of brilliant observation and attention to dialogue (even though the funniest conversation is blatently ripped off from Kevin Smith's ""Mallrats""). However, Archie was written as the ideal reader, a guy who understands that comics are entertainment, not reality. He epitomizes everything i dislike about this movie. Every scene he is in is either hinting at a message, or explaining a message. The theme Archie brings to the story is furthered by ridiculously pathetic acts of violence and obsession, which ruin the film's last 4th. If one were to watch the ending of the movie and then the beginning, he would not have any idea they belonged to the same picture. Take Natasha Lyonne's character for instance. At the opening of the movie, she is a bright woman who runs a comic book store very casually. A slow change and character ark would have been brilliant for her character. However, after one stupid plot-hole-filled scene, she becomes a vengeful warrior obsessed with getting the mcguffin of the piece, the dead man's comics. And by the end, the film has made such lifeless criminals out of the characters, I couldn't even enjoy watching Logue, Rappaport, or Elwes anymore. The theme of the movie jumps so violently from comedy to black ""comedy"", that it no longer becomes entertaining. A potentially brilliant film cut down by the director's hatred for comic book readers.",1042934400,11,2319,4.8734177215189876
1740485,4,B00006AUJG,"As mentioned in another person's review, this is a film that speaks to a specific niche(i.e. us comic book fans)so some of the jokes and characters(especially the Qualls and Logue characters)may go over people's heads. Still, it's a great black comedy and will definately entertain all those Kevin Smith fans out there. Logue is hilarious as he vacillates between the classic smug comic geek and the crazed obsessed fanatic.  The only small downside is the lack of DVD extras.",1032825600,3,476,5.025316455696203
1740486,4,B00006AUJG,"I heard about this DVD from an Entertainment Weekly article. They recommended it.  I knew some of the actors and was familiar with Robinson's work in the comics (some of those books I like and some I didn't). Given I'm a comic reader for 30 years, I figured I'd give it a shot.
It is a very dark comedy. The humor comes from the extremes these two collectors will go through to try to latch onto an ultimate collection. The shop owners are very sterotypical extremes of the industry, but any person who has been buying comics for many years will recognize the traits.
Robinson also makes a statement on the comic industry as it has gotten into through the 90's and into the new millenium. It also takes shots at some traits of fans.  We all know folks like them as well.

1740487,4,B00006AUJG,"In a small town, a comic book collector passes away, leaving a phenomenal collection in the hands of his elderly mother.  The owners of the town's two rival comic book stores hear about it, and become obsessed with acquiring the collection.  For Raymond (Donal Logue), whose entire life revolves around comics, the collection represents a dream, a chance to be taken seriously and remembered by his peers.  For Norman (Michael Rappaport) and Judy (Natasha Lyonne), it's all about the money.  Teenage fanboy Archie (DJ Qualls) just wants to see his friend Raymond happy.  And the shady, mysterious Carter (Cary Elwes)?  Who knows his true motivation?
What starts out as a whimsical tale of oddball obsession takes a very dark turn about 2/3 of the way through, when everything goes horribly wrong.  It is to writer/director James Robinson's credit that he keeps the viewer onboard, despite this tremendous shift in tone.  We can see him bring the characters to the brink of madness, so the transition feels more natural, and not completely forced.
I should point out that I am a huge comics fan, and have known people just like the ones in the movie.  (Though I'd like to think I'm more Archie than Raymond.)  I have been a fan of James Robinson's work for years, and eagerly awaited this, his first feature film as writer and director.  This film provides an interesting counterpoint to the tales of collecting and nostalgia presented in his Starman series.  Overall, his message is a little heavy-handed (Interest Good, Obsession Bad), but he manages to create mostly fleshed-out characters through his customary clever dialogue.  There are lots of insider references to comics, but viewers unfamiliar with comics shouldn't be put off any more than non-doctor viewers are put off by the medical terminology in a typical episode of ER.  The detail just helps illustrate how much the comics mean to the characters, which in turn helps explain why this particular collection is so important.
The actors bring the characters to life in a believable fashion.  The real surprise for me was Cary Elwes, who I generally think of in stick-up-his-wazoo, pretty-boy roles like in Twister or his recent turn on X-Files.  Here, he manages to play a nasty two-bit, low-life punk with some edge, and I almost didn't recognize him.  It's a low-budget, independent film, but a cast of names we recognize from other films give it some prestige.
This won't be the last movie we'll see written by James Robinson; his screenplay based on Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is already being filmed.  Hopefully, this won't be the last we'll see of his direction, either.  It's too dark and nasty a film to be called charming, and the message is a little too obvious and not particularly clever, but it's very watchable, and I enjoyed it.",1031356800,24,2827,4.938689217758985
1740488,3,B00006AUJG,"Comic Book Villians is movie that seemed destined for the Gen-X set, ruthlessly cynical of our own human nature, form the very begenning the movie's central characters Ray(Donal Logue) and Norman(Micheal Rappaport) have already been pushed over the edge by their own greed and emptyness.
The movie is told through the eyes of Archie(D.J. Qualls) a levelheaded type who lives on is own and collects comics although not as obsessively as Ray. Venturing almost every afternoon to the Ray's comic book outlet he exchanges factoids and insights with his brood. The town they live in is your typical small, white-bread everybody knows knows everyone kinda mid-western area. The only thing that keeps Arch going is his friendship with Ray. Across town Norman Link and his wife (Natasha Lyonne) have a similar store, although theirs is more profit based and not on the heritage of the famed books.
Word spreads one day of a old man who croaked, this would mean little if he hadn't had collected comics his whole life, leading Ray to tears and Norman to expansion options. Everything from Superman's first appearence to every back issue is accounted for. The old man's mom though, refuses to sell. leading to a battle of wits between the two battling entrepeneurs.
The heart of the movie is in it's characters, vulgar, witty and darkly obsessive are these men who spend there days in a lustful search for the ultimate collection. the best aspect of the film is Logue's stunningly convincing performance as he tries every sneaky trick to land his hands of the greatest collection ever known. Also effective is Qualls as Ray's hapless friend who remains utterly bemused by his friends obsessive behaviour.
Aesthetically the movie is pleasing to the eyes and ears, the music has a quasi-Batman style speed and haste, suggesting the pure insanity that these characters personify.
This movie is not for everyone,it deals with subject matter only interesting for Kevin Smith fans and comic enthusiasts, Logue commands the film but Rappaport remains a bit to inane and whiny, he seems funnier when acting black. Interseted partys will not be dissapointedif nothing more for then the atmosphere of pure dementia which the movie carries.",1031270400,,2219,5.049046321525886

1740548,5,B00006AUJG,"For anyone that ever enjoyed reading or collecting comics, this is a really funny movie. Poor critic review, but still worth the price for an evening's entertainment and reminiscing as you hear various titles being described or comic covers displayed. Lots of twists and turns.

1740551,2,B00006AUJG,"The minimum is one start.  This one gets two only because I don't feel it's fair to give it the dreaded one start without actually watching the film.  And after multiple attempts, I was never able to get past the first 30 minutes.  There are some very respectable names in this movie, particularly for geekdom, but I'm sure they all shudder any time someone reminds them they were involved with this disaster.
The plot is far too niche and convoluted to buy into, the dialogue is only slightly less painful than the realization that no one in this thing is investing a shard of their potential.",1408233600,,594,4.584905660377358

if the end was different I would want to see it again, make them get the comics and start a big store or something but everyone dying at the end like no",1395878400,,616,4.099173553719008
1740554,4,B00006AUJG,"This film deserves more attention than it gets; it's more enjoyable than alot of the comedies out there even if one has no interest in the comic book aspect shown in the film. That can be looked at as a frame for the characters and an incidental device to move the plot along.  Of particular interest in the piece, even for people who are not comic fans, are the distinct characters and their quirky mannerisms, even the actors without as much screen time in this cast stand out.  It's an interesting yet sometimes funny study of what greed can make people do, and how any type of obessession can bring out the worst emotions in people. It is held together quite well by the narration of one of the main characters, and in spite of its title manages to hit more than one emotional note throughout.  It deserves a much wider audience because of the fine character acting of the entire cast.",1349222400,,889,4.4753086419753085
1740555,3,B00006AUJG,"It seems some of the other reviewers are offended that comic book collectors are depicted as greedy murderers in this film. As a comic book fan myself I would like to point out that it is the comic book dealers who are depicted this way not the collectors themselves. And any collector I know has sort of a love/hate relationship with comic book dealers. From my experience a lot of comic book dealers are in fact greedy people who offer collectors a penny for every dollar worth of comic books you try to sell to them so this film was enjoyable for me. I also enjoyed the idea of a big mint condition collection of silver and golden age comic books being discovered. This is every comic book fans dream come true. I enjoyed the actors in this film. This is a fun black comedy not to be taken too seriously. Once again I find it odd that some fans object to the violence in this film since most comic books deal with a lot of violence all the time. And in real life let's face it there are a lot of loser, bitter comic book collectors (not all or even most of course) who take their hobby way too seriously. The message of this film is that comic books are fun but there is more to life than comic books and you should get out of the comic book store and go explore what the rest of the world and life has to offer. I agree with that and think it is a good message.",1299801600,3,1365,4.135338345864661
1740556,3,B00006AUJG,"First off Im a huge comic fan. I buy comics whenever I can to read and hope it would be one day be the next ""Amazing fantasy #15"". Now this movie shows the dark side of comic fandom. 2 rival comic shops fighting it out to be ones who recieve the mother of all comic collections.

Now this movie was a little funny at times, but most of the characters are so vial that you don't really care about them. The plot was too predictable from begining to end, to the point that you knew what was going to happen many minutes ahead of time. Dont get me wrong, the storyline was good but everything else was ok at best. I would recomend this movie only if it won't cost you much.",1290556800,,670,4.075757575757576
1740586,3,B00006AUJG,"A nice little black comedy without grand pretensions. My teen fanboy and I watched it together and had a ripping time. The big plot developments were easy to anticipate, but there were little twists along the way that added some amusement. A definite for people who know the sub-culture, may seem contrived to an outsider, but not as much as one might think.",1283558400,,358,4.698412698412699
1740587,2,B00006AUJG,"James Robinson started out with a pretty good idea although I was hoping for a character based more on the comic book guy from ""The Simpsons"". He had enough money to make a technically solid feature out of his material, and he did a fairly good job of casting (except for Cary Elwes). I won't bother to summarize the plot but will just address what went wrong. And enough is wrong to render this thing genuinely terrible.

It appears that Robinson was inspired to totally change his original ending late in the game, but was not inspired enough to rewrite the first half of his screenplay (very lazy). Which means there is a HUGE disconnection between the first and the second halves of the movie. This is not a good thing because in the first half Robinson provides film language elements (signs and syntax) that point in an entirely different direction from the way the film ends up going. The whole idea of film is to effectively tell a story; bottom line is that writers and directors who do this well are considered talented.

As I was watching it I gave it more credit than it deserved. I was waiting for them to reveal that the mother and the robber had just set up the store-owners to teach them a lesson. After a point I had to abandon this idea and began to wonder if it was a parody without any humor. If that's the idea then someone should explain to Robinson that to be successful a parody should be funny.

There were some very good shots in this movie. Natasha Lyonne gave a particularly good performance even if it was a grown-up version of her ""American Pie"" character. So a lot of good work was totally wasted on something that doesn't work on any level which is very sad.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1114041600,4,1738,4.41875
1740588,2,B00006AUJG,"There is an underlining message to COMIC BOOK VILLIANS.  All involved in this film must either hate comic books and its industry or know a lot about it... or care about comic books to put out this ""message"" film.  It can go either way. In the mid-to-late 90's, the comic book industry and its subculture went on a collecting and memorabilia craze. People thought they were going to buy comic books as investments and be millionaires. That plan bottomed out and the industry nose-dived. COMIC BOOK VILLIANS indirectly is an outgrowth of what happened to the industry in the late 90's. The film is a cross between PULP FICTION, A SIMPLE PLAN, and VERY BAD THINGS with a touch of 'Kevin Smith' thrown into the mix. Two rival comic book storeowners Ray and Norman (Donal Logue / Michael Rapaport respectively) in a small town find out a local avid collector has died. Then they figure that they can get his comic book collection and sell it for a windfall. Unfortunately, the guy lived at his Mom's house (Eileen Brennan) where he kept his collection and she refuses to sell.  So, the two rivals devise plans to woo her to get the collection.  However, she stands her ground not to sell. They end up resorting to drastic measures to get the collection and it gets real ugly, and very, very, violent. The plot starts out innocently enough with the script and dialogue having ""comic book-knowledge"" banter and even mentions the SDComic Con Int. (The San Diego Comic Con International)etc. However, it suddenly takes a sharp left turn and it is jarring and unwatchable.  None of the characters are likeable. The only positive aspect of the film is that one of the characters; a comic book aficionado  (D.J. Qualls as Archie) realizes the futility of comic book collecting and comes out on top.  Therefore, as stated, there is an underlining message of the film; and that it is telling comic book 'fan-boys' to ""GET-A-LIFE!"" and that there is a whole world out there to explore besides the world of comic books and its obsession with memorabilia and collections. The film is blatant in this message  and if that is its main intent, it is a scathing dig on the whole culture of the comic book industry.",1102032000,3,2193,4.692708333333333
1740589,5,B00006AUJG,"This is a movie for the fans of comic books, eccentric actors, and/or just for people who are generally odd-ball types.  If you fit into any of the above categories, you must buy this movie!  Or watch it on STARZ!",1086739200,4,213,4.3
1740590,3,B00006AUJG,"Eileen Brennan, way long ago from LAUGH IN and PRIVATE BENJAMIN, has the best lines in this film when she asks DJ Qualls if he likes funny books.  In a movie about obsessive comic book fans and collectors, it sums up the banality of the obsession.  COMIC BOOK VILLAINS starts out in a fairly light vein, with some funny scenes and then turns bleakly dark, and by the end of the movie, you feel like you need Prozac.  Another lesser known film, STRANGER THAN FICTION, did this funny to horrifying segue, and it worked.  Somehow COMIC BOOK VILLAINS doesn't make this transition as easily.  Donal Logue as the totally obsessed Raymond starts out rather cool, then almost zany in his obsession, but by the end, his murderous rage totally disengages him from real life.  DJ Qualls (The Core) once again plays the nerdy friend to the tee.  Qualls will probably always look seventeen, but he's a disciplined performer, and shines in his role.  Natasha Lyonne and Michael Rapaport are such caricatures that when Lyonne decides to end their marriage, it seems way out of character.  Cary Elwes plays way against type as the hoodlum Carter, but even his metamorphosis from a guy trying to make life work to a crazed kidnapper seems improbable.
Eileen Brennan is glorious as the intended victim, and though she looked very old and frail, her reserve energy boosted the film when she was on screen.
A different kind of film, but not as fulfilling as it should have been.",1083196800,3,1458,4.708661417322834
1740591,2,B00006AUJG,"Anyway when I first heard of this movies I had such high hopes for it... but it reallty took a trip down the toliet. For the first 45 minutes or so it was hilarious, the ""accidental"" running over Logue, even when he incinuated that Archie was ""doin'"" the old lady. I was excited about the cast it seemed really cool. But right after the old lady got stabbed it just took a turn for the worse. I'm a comic book fan myself and I don't even buy this.  Okay I can buy that Logue would hire a man to steal the comics, I can buy that the old woman got stabbed by accident, I can even buy that no one wanted to call the police for her, but anything beyond that was on the wrong track. I was very disappointed to where it came to in the end. It felt like I was watching two different movies at the same time. I don't know... was this supposed to be dark humor or serious? PICK ONE! The dark humor quickly turned from something funny to something serious, then to something funny and light hearted again. There were a few things I liked about it that DJ was figuring out that there was a life outside of comic books and to get a life, and even how the rivals were going about getting the priceless comic books. I went from liking the movie to surprised then pissed off then indifferent. Not a good reaction.

1740592,3,B00006AUJG,"Well I just rented Comic Book Villians.  When I was looking at the cover it looked promising.  I like Donal Logue in Grounded For Life, n he was funny in Blade.  But I was hoping this would be kind of like Mallrats.  Mallrats is probably my favorite comedy, well most all of Kevin Smiths comedies(Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) are my favorites, except Dogma, im not really into the religious thing.  But anyway back to CBV.  The movie is actually pretty good, with a few funny parts.  And i do mean a few, prolly the only part i really laughed at was when Donal Logue(Raymond Mcgillicuddy) is talking about his money problems and sum1 says but you have loyal customers, n Raymond replies, well ya so does Mcdonalds, but they just brought in a few billion more than i did ok.  Anyways Raymond and Normal are rival comic book store owners, and are trying to get there hands on the collection of a recently dead old man.  Who had been collecting for 45 years.  The mans mother refuses to sell them, and that leads the to men to try and steal the comics.  It turns from slightly funny to a very weird everyone goes nuts n gets guns tone, witch has a man killed because he didn't know what comic Wonder Woman was first introduced in.  Over all its a good comic book-fan movie, but I am a comic book collector, and i was hopeing for more inside comic book humour, that only really happens at the beginning of this film...",1081728000,2,1459,4.402985074626866

While I was prepared to find a few laughs and inside jokes in ""Comic Book Villains"" (I AM a nerd  after all), instead, the movie didn't even produce a chuckle.  I'd save this film for only hard core geeks, who want to see their fellows in all their laughable humiliation-filled glory on DVD.

Anyway back to this DVD AAAARRRGGGGGG!!!!  That's how I feel about it.
The movie was ok with that skinny guy my daughters like for some reason, yeah he's been in some funny movies I have seen but this was not one of them.  There were few good parts and even fewer laughs, but that was not the worst!
THE WORST was watching comics burning and water dripping on them and floating around in a lake or pond of something!!
OH THE HORROR!!!
My wife did get a big kick out of me gasping every time a comic was damaged though.
I was waiting at the end of the movie for the disclaimer that stated that no comics were harmed during the filming of this movie.
I had nightmares about my collection being destroyed all night long.  Bad movie!  Bad bad movie!

1740595,2,B00006AUJG,"Written and Directed by James Dale Robinson, COMIC BOOK VILLAINS wastes a potentially good cast  which includes DJ Qualls, Michael Rappaport, Natasha Lyonne, Donal Logue and Cary Elwes in this WAR OF THE ROSES style battle of rival comic book geeks/ store owners (Rappaport and Logue) and the war they wage to buy the valuable collection of a fan who committed suicide. The only problem is the man's elderly mother refuses to sell them. So in the tried and true tradition of almost all ""black comedies"" this inevitably leads to murder; but it takes its sweet time getting there.
To demonstrate how pathetic these guys are, someone is klled over not knowing which issue of which comic Wonder Woman made her debut in. ... if it's not Lynda Carter then I don't care. And how could a drip like Rappaport's character end up married to a babe like Lyonne? Ahh Hollywood: factory of the impossible dream!
Given that this review is briefer than my usual ramblings, I obviously coudn't find much to like about this; and there aren't really any standout scenes or snippets of awful/amusing dialogue et al to help expand on my opinions.

7966686,5,B00006AUJG,"Great movie that holds up pretty well considering the fact it was made in 2002. The ending goes a little over the top because it's hard to accept that some of the characters take the actions they do, but it's fiction and it is allowed to go any direction it wants to.

The plot involves rival comic shops on either side of town discovering a huge stash of vintage comics somewhere in the middle. Things start off innocently enough, but as the value of the collection is slowly revealed, basic human greed drives the story into very dangerous territory.

The characterizations of the comic nerd community are overly generalized, Within the context of the story and because of the need for few actors due to budget, this is no big deal. The acting is good and the film is evenly paced and full of twists and turns.
