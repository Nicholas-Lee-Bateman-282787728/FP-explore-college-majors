5932018,1,B00EP1BMT8,The story was all over the place and the acting was terrible. It seemed like they were making up scenes as they went along. This movie is below low-budget.,1388275200,4,155,4.379310344827586
5932019,3,B00EP1BMT8,"The plot was there, but the storyline was all over the place. In the end, you see why, but the writer could have tied it in more.  Moral of the story- When you get married, it's best to start anew: home, mind, spirit.  The husband did many things wrong and so did the wife.  But were too immature to see what they had.  But the ultimate is having a pre-nup.  They were doomed from the start.",1388102400,,391,4.092105263157895

5932021,1,B00EP1BMT8,"I would give this no stars if that was an option.  Very unrealistic.  Plot was slow to develop, if you can even call it a plot.

5932027,5,B00EP1BMT8,This movie was great.  Had a lot of unexpected actions on the part of the characters.  I would definitely watch this again.

5932047,1,B00EP1BMT8,"...JUST TERRIBLE. The whole story line is confusing. The characters have no arc. Shauna's bipolar manic crazy scenes are, quite frankly, annoying after the 2nd time she appears and take the story absolutely nowhere. To the writers of this project, please do better.

The plot in this movie was as lame as the lead characters ability to pick a woman.
A lot of the characters made no sense. Other characters overacted their roles till it was laughable just watching them. The only nice thing about this movie was the cinematography.",1417478400,,373,4.420289855072464

In the end, literally none of the supporting characters even matter but one, and none of the story or the dialogue is the least bit likely to happen in real life.  Nothing is established, so don't waste your time watching it and trying to figure out whats going on.  Like a tootsie pop, the world may never know.",1413676800,3,451,4.69620253164557

5932064,1,B00EP1BMT8,This movie was long and terrible. I had to watch it over 2 nights because after an hour I was done with the bad acting and weird plot.  Nothing made sense.  The chick had the same outfit the whole time... Really?  But she was the best actor in the film,1404864000,2,252,4.0
5932065,1,B00EP1BMT8,"I consider myself a self proclaimed movie critic. I have watched many movies good, alright & bad but this was one of the WORST movies I have seen, it just did not make any sense, lack of transition, lack of storyline, the comedic actors were just silly...not funny at all. I am usually easy on the movies I watch but I could not have any mercy on this film. #wasteofmytime #simplyunnecessary",1403654400,,391,4.52112676056338

5932068,1,B00EP1BMT8,this movie was a hot mess. the best part was the end. i had to skip through most of it to keep from falling asleep. geesh. most of the characters were not needed. its like they just threw the movie together and said lets see if it sells and honey the movie did not even measure up to the title. this movie seuckedddddd,1402185600,,318,4.063492063492063
5932069,2,B00EP1BMT8,Would not recommend; Too many unnecessary (long) scenes with characters that made the movie tank. Good title but poor direction.,1401235200,,128,5.45
5932070,1,B00EP1BMT8,Bad acting and a jumbled plot headline this movie.  Watching paint dry would have been more entertaining...sad that this ever made it to Amazon.,1400025600,,144,5.0

5932072,1,B00EP1BMT8,"The movie was so bad that I stopped watching mid-movie. The acting was terrible, there was no plot, and some of the scenes lasted way too long. Some of the characters' personalities were unbelievably extreme. Other characters' personalities were not developed or were inconsistent. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest, I rate the movie 2. One point for effort and one point for having okay camera shots for a low-budget movie.",1398729600,2,438,4.701298701298701
5932073,5,B00EP1BMT8,Excellent movie suspense love deception twisted minds actress very convincing playing scorned lover very realistic scenarios. Very good dvd movie,1398643200,,145,6.3
5932074,1,B00EP1BMT8,"oh, there was so much wrong with this movie.  certain things become clear by the time the credits roll, but some other stuff just never makes sense.

among other problems, there were too many twisted, unnecessary characters.  the little girl scout-types, slim-p, the idiotic nursing home lady, slim-p's baby mama.  there are more, i just don't want to bother listing them.

i understand that the writer's imagination plays a huge part in what goes into a movie, but shouldn't there be an occasional nod to reality?  example:  the police are alerted to the fact that a car has been parked in the neighborhood for a very long time.  they apparently don't get much more information, but with very little provocation, they stake out the couple's home for an entire year.  where do these people live that they get that kind of service from the cops?  perhaps they're in an area where they don't get much criminal action.  that might explain why shanna was shot full of holes when she wouldn't put her gun down.  yeah, she'd shot a couple of people, but she wasn't shooting at the cops.  well.  they showed her who's boss.

one more thing.  the house is huge.  why was morris sleeping on his living room couch when his annoying wife got mad at him?  he shares a room with his wife; the boarder has a room.  this gigantic, two-story house only has two bedrooms?

conclusion:  this is a very bad movie!  Bad, BAD movie!!!",1398384000,2,1413,4.612903225806452
5932075,2,B00EP1BMT8,"The story line was good but, was hard to follow.  The ending was a typical ""crazy black woman"" scene. Thumbs down.",1397692800,,114,4.428571428571429
5932076,5,B00EP1BMT8,The movie was great. It made you think about relationship . How to trust somebody ? Don't let no body make you go crazy if they don't want you just walk away and start new live.,1396915200,,177,3.9444444444444446
5932077,1,B00EP1BMT8,"I chose this rating because the story line seem like it was just thrown together without any thought on how to present the deceptions, which I'm still trying to figure out. My dislikes of the movie certainly covers the relationship of the married couple, it had no love from the beginning. I would not recommend this movie it left wondering why was money wasted on this production.",1394841600,,381,4.701492537313433
5932078,2,B00EP1BMT8,"I can somewhat appreciate the storyline, but there were silly things added that disapointed. The downward spiral of the crazy chick got WAY TOO MUCH screen time. We get it! She was bitter and crazy. The sidekick constantly using incorrect words and begging for money became old and repetitive after the first time. A lot of wasted screen time on side stories. The wife was a horrible actress. I actually think the storyline has hope...",1394150400,,435,4.8133333333333335

5932080,1,B00EP1BMT8,These actors and actresses got long way to be a professional actor. It seems like couldn't hire enough people to play the act. The Plot's not making any sense.

5932086,1,B00EP1BMT8,"Can we say BeLoW low budget?  Horrible is too good to describe this movie.  It was as if three different writers wrote three unrelated, yet equally pitiful stories, then did an amateur job of weaving them together to form the worst looking pattern you can imagine.  Add poor quality recording and the rookie actor performances to the pitiful stories and you have a very distasteful dish.  I love watching movies about love, relationships, family, friendships, etc...any potentially realistic stories that I could possibly relate to (especially those with black people), but this was extremely disappointing.",1391126400,10,607,5.3578947368421055
