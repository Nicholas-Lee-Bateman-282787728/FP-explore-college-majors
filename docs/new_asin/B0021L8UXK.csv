3832226,5,B0021L8UXK,"I knew nothing about The Crazies going into the theater.  I didn't know it was originally produced by the father of the zombie genre, George Romero.  And I didn't expect to see a movie about a sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) and his pregnant wife (Radha Mitchell) with my own wife six months pregnant. Please note: this review contains spoilers.

The movie starts out slowly.  In these stressful times, we're all too familiar with scenes of sudden gun violence in an idyllic setting.  After sheriff Dutton is forced to gun down a former town drunk on a little league field, the town of Ogden Marsh begins to unravel.  Everybody knows everybody else in this small town and a murder leaves emotional aftershocks that traumatize its citizens. This includes Dutton's wife, who happens to be the town doctor.

The tension slowly notches up from there. These early moments are critical in establishing The Crazies as a superior horror film. The petty rivalries, the secret and not-so-secret grudges, the sadistic bullies - all of the townsfolk's deepest impulses are let loose through the TRIXIE virus, a military bioweapon that has accidentally (?) contaminated the town.

Unlike so many other horror movies, Dutton and his deputy Clank (Joe Anderson) are precisely the people who should be dealing with an outbreak.  The problem is that they are little fish in a very big pond.  The movie quickly morphs from a slasher flick to survival horror when the military gets called in, loses control, and pulls out.

What makes The Crazies so refreshing is that it plays on horror tropes, using it to narrative advantage.  We find out that the soldiers who are executing townsfolk aren't faceless, that the TRIXIE virus may or may not be transmitted through the water supply, and that taking one's temperature isn't a guaranteed means of identifying who's infected. The Crazies makes no promises but always delivers.

This ambiguity may frustrate some people who expect everything to be wrapped in a neat bow, but director Breck Eisner knows that there is horror in uncertainty.  It's precisely this lack of clarity that makes the movie so good - the villains aren't unilaterally evil, the victims aren't always helpless, and the solutions aren't always moral.  The Crazies wallows in the gray area of harsh decisions, treating an outbreak with all the ethical gravity of a war.

Let there be no doubt, this is as much a war movie as it is a horror movie. The real crazies, Eisner seems to say, is anyone who would trust authority. These days, that may not be such bad advice.

P.S. Stay through the credits!",1267401600,41,2591,4.892448512585812
3832227,3,B0021L8UXK,"I suppose I can't fault ""The Crazies"" for delivering exactly what it promised: Screaming victims, bloody deaths, scary things hiding in the dark, and, of course, crazy people. But there really isn't anything new here. It's a remake of the 1973 film directed by George A. Romero, which itself has similarities to his own ""Night of the Living Dead"" and would go on to inspire its apocalyptic sequels, also directed by Romero (some of which have already been remade, and you'll forgive me if I'm belaboring the point). It's a typical zombie story set in a typical Middle American farming community inhabited by typical white-bred people, some of whom are given that distinctive Southern drawl for maximum effect. This definitely includes the trigger-happy rednecks that shoot at zombies for no reason other than the sheer joy of it.

The town is Ogden Marsh, Iowa. Population: 1,260. It's one of those places where the people earn a living and life is simple. In due time, things start to go wrong. Some of the residents act ... funny. At first, it doesn't seem so bad; they space out pretty easily, and maybe they'll repeat something they just said a second earlier. But then, for no apparent reason, they begin to bleed all over, and what's worse, they become homicidal maniacs. What's causing this epidemic of insanity? The local sheriff, David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) and his deputy, Russell Clank (Joe Anderson), have reason to believe that the local water supply is to blame. Maybe it has been contaminated with an unknown toxin.

Before long, the military gets involved. Well armed and merciless, the soldiers are not too far off from the zombies they're trying to quarantine - they're violent, single-minded, and anonymous, their faces obscured by dark gas masks while they relentlessly follow someone else's orders via walkie-talkies. The remaining residents of Ogden Marsh are rounded up and taken to a makeshift medical ward, where people are forcefully separated on the basis of whether or not someone has an elevated temperature. Sheriff Dutton's wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell), falls into the second category, and she's taken away despite Dutton's assertion that she's pregnant and prone to slight fevers. She soon finds herself strapped to a stretcher in an area designated for the already infected. Unfortunately, an attempted jailbreak results in some of the crazies escaping, and one of them is headed straight for Judy, a bloody pitchfork dragging behind him.

It soon becomes a matter of survival, David, Judy, Russell, and a teenager named Becca (Danielle Panabaker) pitted against an illness and a brutal military presence. Can they escape Ogden Marsh? Will they become infected? Will they be shot dead before they have the chance to become infected? And what is the secret of this plague? Where did it come from? How did it come to be there? The answers to all of the above are given, but I seriously doubt you'll find any of them surprising.

Still, if you haven't yet grown tired of the zombie genre, then chances are ""The Crazies"" will not disappoint you. Indeed, it's a striking visual achievement, some of the most frightening scenes taking place in cramped, shadowy spaces. I also give the filmmakers credit for creating gore effects that aren't relentlessly campy. There's a sequence, for example, in which a crazed mortician starts wielding a working bone saw; I expected a retread of the morgue sequence from ""Re-Animator,"" but instead, I got a dark and fairly unnerving moment of bloody violence. Another sequence, this one involving a crazy and a can of gasoline, is surprisingly chilling and not at all a cheap gimmick that plays for laughs.

It's simply a matter of having seen so many movies like this before. Everything from Romero's films to ""28 Days Later"" to ""Doomsday"" to ""Quarantine"" to the ""Resident Evil"" trilogy have told more or less the exact same story to varying degrees of success. Quite frankly, it's starting to get old.

The final thirty minutes of ""The Crazies"" are problematic in that every scene feels like the finale; a resolution is overshadowed by another crisis, which is then resolved before leading to another crisis, etc., etc. More than once I was ready to get out of my seat and leave the theater, and more than once I was hit with a new turn of events. How many twists does one movie need? And why should they be allowed to spill over into the end credits, at which point it becomes overkill? I guess horror audiences have come to expect nothing less. I can't say that I hated or even disliked ""The Crazies,"" for it succeeds at being exactly what it wanted to be. Maybe, somewhere deep down, I was hoping it would surpass my expectations. There are few things more satisfying than a film that delivers more than it promises.",1267142400,3,4787,4.9037037037037035
3832228,4,B0021L8UXK,"I never saw George A. Romero's original film, but from the reviews I've read, this remake is even better in the eyes of many.

Basically, half the inhabitants of a small town, with a population of 1,260, start killing off family members and neighbors. It's hard to describe what happens next without giving anything away, so I'll just comment on the other aspects. It reminded me a little of 28 Days Later, mainly in the fact that the people are not zombies. They are infected by a kind of virus and have turned murderous because of it. There are quite a few scenes that are genuinely creepy and more than a few of those cheesy jump scares, but thankfully The Crazies stays grounded in reality, making the impact of what's going on that much more intense. There are a couple of instances where I was thinking that some of the people were idiots for doing things I wouldn't dream of in such a situation, but hey, it's a horror movie. The pacing drags slightly at times, but they were sure to put just enough surprises around the corner to keep your interest. The acting is what you would expect. Not grand, but not weak by any means. Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell carry most of the burden and do enough to make you care what happens to them by the end. The gore level is strong, just not the splatterfest level that you might expect.

The Crazies is not one you have to rush out and see, but it's well worth your time when it hits DVD. I happen to agree with most critics in this case, because it's definitely one of the smarter horror remakes I've seen.

There is plenty of blood and grisly gruesomeness, but they actually have a plausible reason, rather than simply because it's a horror film.

Everyone is fine and does a credible job with their character, not to mention that the lovely Radha Mitchell is an extra treat to watch.

3832369,5,B0021L8UXK,"The zombie/infected genre is like an iceberg: a few really good, well-known ones at the top, but underneath the surface an enormous amount of junk. This is about my 80th such film, so I have seen a few. I make allowances for small budgets, indie attempts, etc. You have to. There are some decent small-budget films out there, though even these are sometimes trashed by people who expect basic Hollywood production standards every time. But the great number of these films are pretty bad to awful. Something about the genre draws the worst of filmmakers and of course a few just out to make a quick buck with a popular subject. it may be the simplicity of the concept. You have zombies: pick slow or fast (usually infected) - add a few survivors, you've got a movie. Except usually you don't. To find one this good is against all odds.

For one thing the film was given a decent budget. It looks like a professional film. It has professional actors, camera work, editing, soundtrack, special effects and direction. As popular as the genre is, you'd think something as basic as giving it a decent budget would be a no-brainer, but this is where most of them fall down. The Crazies was budgeted with a healthy 20 million and made 40 million. See Hollywood? if you make something good people will come to see it; make junk and it's direct to DVD, streaming or YouTube.

  This was a remake of the early 70's George Romero film that practically no one saw. He was too ahead of his time and couldn't get proper financing. The resulting film was undone by its low budget, amateur acting and cheap production. Nevertheless, romero invented the fast, infected ""zombie"" thirty years before 28 Days Later (1972 vs 2002), though it was 28 Days that really put it before the public and popularized it because lots of people actually saw it. This film is pretty true to many of the concepts of the first film and is not just a title rip off. (In fact, George A. Romero is listed as an Executive Producer, which means he didn't really do anything, but gets  a cut of the money).

I'm going to mention a few plot points here, but these are shown very near the beginning of the film, so I don't consider them Spoilers> However if you don't want to know anything, do not read on. Like the original film, the infection is local and not a worldwide epidemic. It is likewise spread  in the same way. The ""Crazies"" themselves are not the howling monsters of the 28 Days type. The infection comes on gradually, so at first there are no physical symptoms, but instead an increasing anger which makes anyone who seems on edge suspect, and in this situation that's about everybody. These infected retain a certain amount of their human characteristics. They have basic logic, they can work together in groups, use tools and weapons and even talk somewhat. As the disease increases they show physical symptoms and are more like rabid animals. All of that follows the original.

A pastoral vision of small town America, cornfields and Baseball in rural Iowa nicely begins the film. The action commences pretty quickly. Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell and Joe Anderson are the principal actors and all are convincing in their roles. This is an action film so there's no time for deep character development, but you do  feel they know and care for each other. The minor characters are well acted, too. The plot is what you would expect - there's only so much you can do with the scenario - but things happen fast and there's one scare or tense scene after another and two truly memorable ones. There nicely is no big villain, just human incompetence behind it all. There are no lame attempts at humor or irony; it's all done for real. Once it gets going it sustains its pace.

i don't know how i missed this one for so long, but I'm glad I found it. If there were only more like this.",1467158400,7,3855,4.573913043478261

The title originally put me off but I said let me try this anyway. is it a zombie-ish movie, sure it is but let me make this distinction, the performances of Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell and Joe Anderson make this movie a cut above the rest. What is it about? Well, once again, the government gets it wrong and puts the small town of Ogden Marsh, (Iowa?) in jeopardy and wants them to stay that way and not let anyone out. A small group led by the Sheriff (Timothy) try to find a way to safety and help. there are tons of chills and thrills going on here and of course, a couple (you moron) moments too. this movie is well worth the viewing time and should be given its due.",1463961600,3,725,4.185714285714286

3832468,5,B0021L8UXK,"UPDATE: Ok, it's fixed! I loved this movie, it was fabulous. I will be buying the DVD for my collection as soon as I get around to it! I thought it was good acting by all, a fun engaging plot, and some quality gore. Not for the sensitive, but hey- it's a horror movie! I actually liked this better than the original, but that's probably only because of the differing production values. Much like Dawn of the Dead and it's remake, the new version seems a bit less like it is trying to make some sort of statement, and just takes you through the fun parts. I'm ok with that, and I love all the versions for their own reasons.

Original review: This Amazon Instant Video is mis-labeled. It is the original film, NOT the 2010 remake.

Still good enough for three stars, although I've been really desperate to catch the re-make, so it's a bit disappointing! I reported trouble with the title in addition to this review (which I can hopefully soon replace with a review of the 2010 movie The Crazies).",1457308800,2,995,4.4316939890710385

This one is a love it or hate it. There's so many zombie movies out there it's easy for this one to get lost in the mix. There's scenes that really stand out in this movie. It's more than a zombie movie. These aren't zombies, these are people who have gone crazy and are running ramped in a small Iowa farming town while the survivors lurk past former friends and family in hopes of reaching some place safe. I feel this film expands on the carnage of the original film. Can't say too much for the acting but they way which the plot pans out and is revealed is well done.",1455667200,,732,4.198581560283688

3832528,3,B0021L8UXK,"It appears not to have occured to any of the reviewers the main difference between the two films. Romero's like most of his films, is a political satire, a withering commentary on Vietnam-era America. This glossy slick remake could have said something about Bush-era America and the war on terror, instead it opts for a crude and fairly formulaic apocapyptic zombie horror story without any of the subversive political subtext of Romero's original. Of course Romero's film was an independent and this is modern Hollywood, and as we know Hollywood doesn't 'do' politics, unless of course it's the crudest warmongering, flag-waving, stars-and-stripes and racist variety seen in The Patriot, Independence Day or Rules of Engagement.

What no one realises and the filmmakers have completely lost sight of, is in Romero's original the 'crazies' are clearly not the infected townspeople whom we actually see very little of beyond the small group struggling to escape. Apart from the opening scene, there is almost no violence committed by the infected townspeople; they are mostly seen being gunned down by the panicky and largely inexperienced soldier and national guardsmen, sound familiar? In fact in the hospital scene when the mad scientist is accidentally killed we see they are simply spaced out, but entirely hamrless and not dangerous or violent in any way.

The real crazies of course are the military and the incompetent federal authorities who are busy planning the annihilation of the whole town a clear analogy of the US' disastrous adventure in Vietnam that was at that time nearing its end. The twonspeople in the original Crazies are an analogy of all the hopeless, harmless and entirely clueless natives and civilians in any war who get obliterated for no other reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

As we commence a new round of air strikes in the Middle East Romero's sadly forgotten original is a timely reminder of the recurring disasters we inflict on ourselves and others, a message that has seemingly been lost or deliberately ignored by the producers of the remake, more concerned with serving up another formulaic zombie thriller to an already braindead audience. Crazies indeed.",1449360000,,2219,5.124309392265193

3832992,3,B0021L8UXK,"I love good horror movies, but I despise cliches, and after 17 minutes in, I knew what this movie was.

1. The local sheriff is in charge of everything, and he was especially in charge of his California beach blond wife. The live in mid-west farmer America.
2. The blond screams at a burning house as if that in itself is the ultimate horror. The whole time she's doing this, she's climbing all over her husband. He puts a manly restraining arm around her in every scene so far, physically leading her around, as if she can't even walk upright without him.
3. Oh yeah. She's a doctor. So she's the boss of the town, after her boss, the sheriff. They are so in charge.
4. The first victim is a woman who is 20/30 something, but is supposed to be a 40 year-old's wife, so she has no makeup on.
5. There aren't any of the cliche sex scenes, so it does get points for that. I gave it an extra star because I didn't hate it. The end wasn't bad.
6. By the way, I know what really irritated me about the ""in-charge"" role. The people who like this kind of movie like it that the sheriff tried to ""talk down"" the zombie in the first scene with the gun, and that everyone in town was angry with the ""sheriff boss"" because he shot the zombie. The appeal is in the supposedly blameless violence. It's ok to bring a gun to a softball game and pretend to threaten people with it if you're drunk, see? Shooting him was supposedly ""controversial"", instead of... well... what happens when you point a gun at somebody in a threatening way. I can expect the other characters in the movie from here on out to rebel against everything the sheriff-boss says from here on out (and if it's female, to be screamy with terror, and in terror, do the exact opposite of whatever he says, and therefore get chopped). Blah. Make with the bloodletting. Fake sentiment in horror movies is what gives them a bad name, not the gore or violence.",1414195200,,1909,4.332402234636872

Romero was one of the  three Exclusive Producers proving it was going to be good.  The first time you watch it, the ending will give you chills.  Without giving it away I will say ""It's disturbing to think the extent of what the government/military will go to  to stop and cover up an incident.""

3833119,5,B0021L8UXK,"I have never seen the original ""Crazies"" film so I can not comment on which version is better. The Crazies(remake)takes an overplayed zombie genre idea and tries to make it more realistic. The story is told simply with a plausible background story. Instead of hordes of zombies running around like supercharged baboons or sloth-like undead roaming aimlessly, these ""zombies"" are alive and act fairly human(at least from a distance), but have a pretty mean disposition. Depending on how far gone they are, they can almost seem normal...I said almost. What makes it seem much more real is that they still seem to have a little memory of the former selves and react to people they know. The special effects and gore are played down a notch, but it doesn't make the film any less frightening. This is largely because the ""zombies"" are the least of your worries! I'm a fan of some of the classic zombie films and there have been a number of good ones in recent years, but The Crazies is one of the few that made me think could this happen? ...and that's pretty scary in itself!",1399507200,2,1072,4.647368421052631

3833466,4,B0021L8UXK,"The original Romero film was a great satire about bureaucratic inefficiency and stupidity.  And if you appreciate it on that level it's very clever.  But I've always found the acting scripting and camera-work awkward at best.  The remake has none of the satire of the original -- which is a shame.  But as a rollercoaster ride, it is first rate and vastly superior.

The original premise hasn't changed: local townsfolk start behaving erratically, the military cordons off the area, and three friends try to escape before things get even worse.  And all the clichs are still there: one of the escapees turns out to be infected, the usual stragglers appear and disappear, the romantic farmgirl-farmboy subplot, faceless troops sealing of the town, etc.  But all of them are deftly delivered with enough of a twist to keep the movie moving -- and always interesting.

The script was sparse -- there are rarely more that four or five lines to a scene -- and yet the movie delivers fully realized characters from beginning to end. In one prolonged nail-biting sequence early in the film almost five minutes go by and the only words spoken are: ""He's got a knife.""

Be warned there is plenty of violence and spraying of blood.  But I couldn't call any of it gratuitous.

Is it high Art? No.  And if any era needs a satire about government and bureaucratic inefficiency (how about a deadlocked congress and a corrupt senate?) it's this one -- although I imagine someone says that every era.

But it is high Entertainment.",1371859200,,1515,4.780769230769231

Great writing, strong performances and beautiful cinematography combine to elevate the film out of its genre into something more -- an intelligent and eminently watchable what-if that seems chillingly plausible. Olyphant and the beautiful Mitchell center the film with level-headed and humane performances and Joe Anderson shines as the deputy who may or may not be infected.

""The Crazies"" is in the front rank of films depicting mankind on the lip of an apocalypse but, unlike many others, this apocalypse could well happen.  This may be the best remake I've ever seen, and it's a clear improvement on the original in my opinion.",1369353600,3,658,5.074074074074074

3833497,3,B0021L8UXK,"Its something of a mystery as to why anyone would want to remake the original George Romero film The Crazies. It was a very forgettable film, but the premise was a good idea. In the case of this remake Breck Eisner managed to improve upon the story and make it worth seeing. I found the film to echo numerous similar stories, and there really isn't anything new that comes to play here. Added to that are the usual familiar formulas with less than plausable sequences that expect the audience to be a little gullible and to suspend a great deal of reality in the process. Some of the subject matter is too far fetched to ever expect it to be anywhere near believable if something like this were to ever happen in real life. None the less there are some genuinly freightening moments through out that work well even if they may seem to feel rather familiar. I also noticed there was a good job with the sound on this film. The work the sound crew did on this is worth taking notice of. I rarely take note of sound achievements in film unless its one of the obvious classics that won an oscar and is remembered for its over all sound quality. This one had me examining the sound a little closer and I couldn't help noticing the work done here where the sound is concerned was above average and worth recognizing. The film is not really awesome, but far from terrible. Its sort of a blend of The hills have eyes and a decent zombie movie, never getting as good as either, but still fairly entertaining. I saw Quarantine last night and felt it was superior on all levels though. it is a film with a similar story to tell, but its much more terrifying and ceetainly between the two the hands-down better choice if you happen to be wanting to decide between one or the other.",1367712000,,1769,4.379939209726444

This movie may be a little gory at times, but it has the ability to frighten you and that will keep you glued to your seat.  The storyline is good and believable.  And as others have said not all the cast is well known, but they do an exceptional job with their parts.  This movie is well worth owning not only to pull out at Halloween for a fright, but any time during the year when you're in the mood for a thrill ride.

P.S.  Amazon Prime?  This seller takes over a week or longer for delivery not the two days promised by Amazon Prime.  Amazon needs to get a seller that can deliver on time.  I'm still waiting for delivery and it has been almost two weeks.

And the question is ""what the hell is going on?"" A lot of suspense. The citizens of the town are trapped in a hell on earth, not of their making. It is ordinary people trying to deal with a horrible situation.  And the government response, that rings true, not because they are evil, but because you know that is what they'd do if something like this happened. The decency of the deputy who makes the ultimate sacrifice, even though he knows he is already ""not right"". A last act of humanity because he knows he is going to lose that. And the ending --- a total loss of control because things are even going to get worse, and our heroes, are they doomed even after a valiant battle to survive, because of a technological accident? And the nagging question: are we all ultimately doomed? But the real question is: who are the crazies?

3833717,4,B0021L8UXK,"The Crazies was a pleasant surprise. After how good Dawn of the Dead was, I was looking forward to another remake of a George Romero zombie, or zombie-esque film. It did not disappoint, but it kind of aggrivates me to say that I do not see a movie of this nature ever being more than what we have seen already in this one, Dawn of the Dead, I Am Legend, or 28 Days Later. I would love to watch a zombie movie that elevates the genre, but it seems to be stuck in a stagnant cycle. But getting past that, I can see the production value in this one. The colors are vivid and help set the shifting tones perfectly. Throughout the course of the film we witnessed a few great scenes in the night time (which most zombie movies tend to fixate on), but also just as many duriing the day. And none were more exciting than the last. I actually bought the explanation of the virus, and began to genuinely hate the government for what it did. That rarely happens to me when I watch these kinds of movies. The actors were great too. All were believable, and I fealt sorry for them. I even fealt sorry for the townsfolk that had been infected.

Timothy Olyphant was a great choice to lead the cast as the town sheriff, David. Radha Mitchell played his wife Judy, and she was just as great. I enjoyed seeing the depth in their relationship, and how much they went through for each other. My favorite performance was Joe Anderson as the deputy, Russell. He provided, not only comic relief at times, but also a depth equal to the main characters, and a final resolution that is quite commendable and may bring a tear to someone's eye depending on how invested in this story they are. The transfer is superb, and the extras are surprisingly thorough. So overall, I would recommend The Crazies to everyone who enjoys these kinds of films. It's not too gorey like most movies in its subgenre, there isn't an abundance of profanity, and there's no sexual content at all. So in my opinion, it's pretty family friendly for what it is (to an extent of course).",1344816000,2,2036,4.400530503978779

I like zombie themed movies and also enjoy escape movies, so this was a good fit for me, despite the occasional ""slasher"" elements.

No plote spoilers from me: The story unfolds in an idealistic farming community where life is predictable and everyone knows everyone, in short a place I would like live. When a seemingly random divergence from the norm occurs, quickly followed by odd (and deranged) behavior by normally upstanding citizens, the small town sheriff (well acted by Olyphant) and his deputy (Anderson) begin to investigate the connections between the events. Add to this a very wholesome and loving relationship between the sheriff and his doctor wife (Mitchell), and you start to care about the three main characters. The pace of the movie changes quickly when the military arrives to contain the situation and it did keep me in an uneasy state (which is good for a horror movie).

I have watched this three or four times now and still find it enjoyable.

3833763,4,B0021L8UXK,"I don't think of this as a viral outbreak movie, but more of a zombie movie without the zombies (no surprise, as the original movie was directed by Romero), & it's also like a serious parody of WW2 where the US military are nazi soldiers wisking away innocents into a concentration camp & killing them regardless of whether or not they're contaminated. It also reminds me of a few episodes of The Walking Dead, which is based on a comic book older than this movie.

I would say I prefer this over the original for no other reason than I cannot tolerate music, sound effects, or the cinematography style of the 70s. Though this one is not without it's cons, like the ridiculously convenient timing in which Russel, who should have been back in town, suddenly appears at the camp & saves his wife at the last possible second when it would have made more sense for her to be saved by another prisoner in the area who'd gotten free.

3833765,4,B0021L8UXK,"Call me an ass who puts too much merit in his predictions, but I told myself years ago that Breck Eisner - relative newcomer director whose track record starts and ends with ""Sahara"" - just needed a little shake-up in his style and genre tackling, and he would find his calling.

So, here we are, with yet another relaunch of an old 70's film that barely classifies as ""cult classic"".  I'd certainly never heard of it and, in all honesty, this re-imagining likely won't convince anyone to go out of their way to do so.

What it will do, however, is transcend typical trends and gain the respect of so many who have vowed to never give the zombie subgenre a chance.  Better yet, it's smart - smart enough to justify all this sauntering about with a gait that's wholly unlike the vast majority of its predecessors.

Very much an exercise in high-brow horror, ""Crazies"", nonetheless, is treated with care and dignity that you can't help but appreciate.  The cinematography, coupled with the uniquely somberness that only America's midwest scenery can evoke, is often striking.  Character and story development each take the road less traveled, complementing one another amidst a pacing that's almost too zippy for its own good.  It's a basic, risk-free chiller of a premise that tries to pull off serious themes and situations beyond its own genre's comfort zones.  And you know what?  It does a good job at convincing us.

Never letting the gore take front and center, Eisner's sound execution makes this a tense and, strictly speaking, frightening experience that genuinely chills.  The enemies seen here are chilling in their unpredictability and ""lurking"" methods; you won't see masses of undead hordes chasing down the desperate heroes a la ""28 Days"".  Rather, the murderers brood and bide in the shadows, infinitely patient but notably exempt of any real desire that one can definitely pinpoint.  They're just sort of ""there"", and it's this uncertainty that makes their inevitable actions all the more shocking.

The wise decisions carry over to the casting, with Eisner and company hiring a strong tag team between Olyphant and Mitchell.  Mitchell, as her career history denotes, excels in the position of the durable woman in exhaustive desperation, and Olyphant is quickly becoming the go-to guy for hardened, albeit seemingly vulnerable, figures of authority in film.  One other noteworthy performance comes from Anderson, whose struggles eventually come to overshadow those of his companions, solely manifesting the degradation of humanity that the film revolves around.

There's little doubt that ""The Crazies"" was working with very little, potential-wise.  After all, how many could stand to sit through another story about zombies?  What was once considered a shoe-in for crowd pleasing and lucrative profit is needing new, creative talent to squeeze what's presently left.  Fortunately, Eisner and his team understood this, and worked twice as hard to win the hearts of not only the enthusiasts, but also those who can respect a film that's genuinely scary and intelligent.",1324166400,,3085,5.1177644710578845
3833766,3,B0021L8UXK,"A well made but rather routine paranoid horror movie. Nothing new to see here, but a very good paint-by-numbers product.",1322092800,,120,5.05
3833767,4,B0021L8UXK,"Today's horror filmmakers (or, rather, film re-makers) keep on lifting from past horror flicks. This time, the source is George Romero's dubious 1973 cult classic. Director Breck Eisner modernizes the story and tries to switch things up a bit by focusing more on the tiny pack of survivors, and less from the military's perspective. THE CRAZIES is a mean and vicious B-horror survival flick, and I do think it superior to the original.

There's always a more gothic feel when the venue veers away from the city and into the countryside, right? THE CRAZIES tells of an apocalypse in the Heartland, in the small midwestern town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa (population: 1,200 or thereabouts, but soon dropping at an alarming rate). The story opens with Johnny Cash somberly serenading you and me to ""We'll Meet Again,"" and I couldn't help but note how ideal to horror cinema is Johnny Cash's ominous gravel voice. He establishes a disquieting mood, gets you all fretting.

This movie is a germophobe's pick of the week. A government plane, conveying an experimental bio-toxin, goes down in the woods and infects the water supply. The inhabitants of Ogden Marsh are soon succumbing to weird stupors and then behaving irrationally, and then murderously. Our point-of-view characters are Sheriff Dave Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) and his pregnant physician wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) and we track them in the course of 24 hours as they're caught in the middle of a harrowing outbreak.

This remake tones down the political allegory so rife in Romero's original version. But there's enough going on in the world currently that Breck Eisner does inject certain themes. The film taps into your deepest sense of paranoia, not of ghosts or zombies, but of more topical concerns - one's fear of disease and infection, one's suspicion of our neighbors, and disillisionment with the government. The military - its grunts gigged out in uniform gas masks - is so concerned with covering its tracks and containing the leaked toxin that it promptly quarantines the town and begins to herd and corral the locals. Except that these viruses are always crazy virulent, aren't they? Things quickly get out of hand. Wash, rinse, repeat.

Communications are cut off in Ogden Marsh, signals to all cell phones and to the Internet abruptly killed. And with the town isolated and mass psychosis at hand, society rapidly breaks down. Darwinism kicks in, anarchy descending like a swift mother. In an apocalypse, ain't that the way the cookie crumbles? Can the Sheriff guide his tiny band of gibbering townspeople out of the quarantined zone?

Oh, to be unhinged and creepy. THE CRAZIES accomplishes what it sets out to do. It serves up chills to ripple up and down your spine. That dish of bleakness comes as dessert. Director Breck Eisner demonstrates restraint. He underplays things and takes time to establish plot and character. He stages long moments in which he lets the nervous tension build up. And when the terrifying set-pieces finally come around, he unleashes his inner gorehound.

These demented infecteds aren't shambling zombies; they aren't zombies at all. To paraphrase someone from the DVD's extra features, these infected are actually bursting with too much life, the virus in them raring to manifest thru their skin. This results in the crazies sporting wicked blood blisters, taut veins, and popping tendons. Somewhere, a dermatologist is tossing and turning. But these make-up visuals prove really effective. The film gratifies the hard-core horror fan, gives the people what they want, to the tune of a series of bloody (and blood-curdling) sequences: a madman puncturing victims with a pitchfork in a medical triage, the Sheriff's encounter with a berserk doctor's bone saw, a pair of locos operating a truck stop service... But the most memorable scene features the Sheriff's nasty, grimace-inducing method of dispensing with one insane woman. This movie is enough to make me swear off water for life. Or at least give up tap water.

Kudos to Joe Anderson, by the way, for making the most out of his Deputy role. For my money, Joe Anderson ends up with the most interesting character arc in this film.

3833770,5,B0021L8UXK,"Even the critics liked this one better. The original film (of the same name, written and directed by the grandfather of survival horror, George A. Romero) and the remake share some similarities in plot, but the characterizations are completely different. But Romero did co-write this one; I guess some hindsight helped this version. Here we have local law enforcement struggling to figure things out instead of former military folk trying to do the same. With Olyphant and company, the film seems a bit more grounded as (at least for me) we actually care about these characters more than their 1973 counterparts.

Either way, we are given a good turn of survival horror as a small town becomes infected by a military bioweapon. The story rides upon the edge of a knife with one slip putting the characters against the infected and the other means getting caught by the military. It is a good look at 'creepy' instead of standard and expected scares, though there is more than enough of the later. There is a great climatic final bout before the credits roll and in the end, I might even watch a sequel if it still had the same characters.

The BD features a bit more than standard fair in the way of special features: a good commentary track with the director, a handful of behind-the-scenes and even a pair of motion comics. All of the features are put together well, no tedium or monotony in the lot. As for presentation, the picture is crisp and clear and the 5.1 track does add to the tension. I'd rather heard a 7.1 track, but I guess I'm still waiting for soundtracks to catch up.

It is rare nowadays to see a real and honest horror movie. Most times we are spoon-fed psycho teen popcorn flicks or gorefests with no plot. While both can be mildly entertaining it is nice to find one that is worthwhile.",1313366400,4,1809,4.594427244582043
3833771,4,B0021L8UXK,"Perhaps it's because I wasn't even a twinkle in my parents' eyes when many of the original films debuted, but the remaking of classic - and not-so-classic - horror films does not offend me in the slightest. Sure, the need for remakes could be read as a sign that Hollywood is losing its imagination, but let's be honest, is there really any film made these days that doesn't borrow material? I believe that just because something comes first, does not make it untouchable. However, I also believe the goal of the remake should be to create a film that stands on its own merits, and can be appreciated apart from its relation to the original, eliminating the need to compare. Reality is, a majority of remakes, such as 2009's Friday the 13th remake, have been utter embarrassments. Still, a few, such as 2004's Dawn of the Dead remake, have been notable films that took the original material, and made it something fresh for the modern audience. The Crazies, a remake of the 1973 film, though not flawless, leans heavily toward the latter classification, breathing style and mounds of tension into a story about societal deconstruction and survival.

A military plane, carrying a biological weapon, crashes in the marshes outside a small Iowa farming town, leaking the virus into the town's water supply. The virus, designed to destroy whole communities, brings out the brutal nature in anyone it infects, turning them into sadistic murderers (Crazies) before it claims their lives. The government swiftly sends in the military to initiate a containment protocol and without remorse, declares martial law upon the clueless town. At the center of the commotion is Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant), his pregnant wife Dr. Judy Dutton (Radha Mitchell),  Deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson), and friend Becca Darling (Danielle Panabaker) who band together and attempt to survive the government extermination of the town.

Although it contains traces of take it or leave it social commentary, The Crazies is first and foremost a horror film, and Director Breck Eisner squeezes every ounce of tension he can from the film's circumstances. From the get-go, Eisner takes a subtle approach to the Crazies' nature, hiding them in the shadows and backgrounds. These are sneaky little buggers and Eisner quickly convinces us that we are never safe. The creatures may appear at any given moment, and once they do, they are relentless. Although there is a tad bit of inconsistency on this point, Eisner mostly allows the Crazies, whose minds have otherwise been taken hostage, to retain thought process. They calculate their actions and trap their victims.

Eisner also makes superb use of locations in conjunction with his style, effectively cornering the characters into situations that leave very little room for escape. At times, the camera lingers on darkness, follows shadows or shifts to reveal an enemy. At others, the audience is thrown directly into the thick of the action. Too often, many horror films end up using far too many shaky camera motions or quick edits to boost the ""scare factor."" Eisner, generally, has avoided this and instead used camera work to create a gritty and edgy style that plays right into the severity of the film's circumstances. He strings together clever, memorable scenes that keep the film energetic and unnerving.

On the downside, the film relies too heavily on two horror genre staples: the jump scene and the last-second save. Jump scenes certainly have their place in scary movies, but the overkill here tip-toes into becoming monotonous. The film contains a few well-placed surprises that do add to the mounting terror, but many of these moments become boring and predictable. The film's heavy use of the last-second save, where another character intervenes just in time to save their fellow man, becomes a tad gimmicky and pretentious. Every horror film contains a moment such as this, but Eisner repeatedly uses this element to free his characters from sticky situations that would otherwise end in their demise.

Still, the film stands firmly on the shoulders of its leads. Olyphant, Mitchell, Anderson and Panabaker bring familiarity to the characters. They resemble people you know and you want to see them make it to the other side of this nightmare. The film could have spent a bit more time developing its characters, but what we are given is enough to care about them. The film also creates such formidable villains in the Crazies and in the militia sent to quarantine the town that we generally feel for the people who are falling at their hands. This was an innocent and productive community that havoc found.

For its flaws, The Crazies is still a fun piece of horror and will hold you in suspense during its run. It contains thrills, excitement and energy. It may be a derivation of an older film, but it stands firm on its own and doesn't need the existence of the original to define it. This is how any remake should be. While it will always be important to respect film history, film culture has changed and with that change comes different audience expectations and moods. Much of what was deemed quality 20 to 30 years ago is now considered archaic, which is likely what audiences 20 to 30 years from now will think of our modern entertainment. A remake is a worthy cause so long as it is done with the intention to create an entertaining new experience using familiar material. It is safe to say The Crazies has done that.",1313020800,,5480,4.93709327548807

3833798,3,B0021L8UXK,"The Crazies Directed by Breck Eisner and written by Scott Kosnar and Ray Wright is a remake of the 1973 classic by the King of the Undead - George A. Romero. While The Crazies may start to look like the undead as time progresses they are not actually of the zombie variety. The Crazies IS an outbreak movie, however there is no plague destroying the country it is just a disease that is causing people to act 'crazy' though there is no rhyme or reason to how it plays out at parts.

It's set in a small town that has a picture perfect setting until a baseball game is interrupted by a man walking onto the field with a shotgun in hand and Sheriff Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) has to shoot him in self defense. Soon after more of the town's populace starts to act 'strangely' and while the sheriff has a hunch that the drinking water may be to blame he is unable to offer up enough proof to have it turned off so turns it off manually. Interestingly enough this is the last time we hear anything about the water. The town quickly starts to become infected and out of nowhere the United States military puts the entire county on lock down.

I'm going to stop right here and interject with my main problem with the movie. In any 'outbreak' movie you pretty much have those are become infected, those who are immune, and those who are able to avoid the infection. Now what I ENJOY seeing outbreak films, they are my favorite kind of movie, I enjoy when the outbreak follows this quite easy standard. The ""crazies"" that are infected though do not follow this formula that well. They have some crazies that don't talk with some that do. Some that work in groups while the majority appear to be loners. I know the very idea that people going crazy shouldn't follow a set pattern however if the government quickly locks down the area you know they are involved. If the government is going to create a disease I see them having first off something easier to control, second off not having it accidentally be let on the loose how it is, and thirdly just no.

Now I'm not saying this is a movie you will never want to watch, but what I am saying is that you can either wait for it to come out on rental or if you haven't seen it yet do yourself a favor and watch the original. Romero's classic, while updated, really just wasn't done justice with the remake. I am an adamant Romero fanboy though this doesn't skew my opinions on his re-makes. Dawn of the Dead remake? I loved it. Day of the Dead ""remake?"" (if you can call it that) Hated it. The Crazies re-make? Meh. It felt as if they wanted to build up the military as well as one group of the crazies up (which I won't give a spoiler on though it is quickly obvious as to who I'm talking about) as the antagonists and failed to have either truly deliver. The military ended up just being speed bumps and the final fight between Sheriff Dutton and said crazies went by far too quickly and easily.",1301875200,,2935,4.332727272727273

How surprised was I?! The writing and acting were very good, and the story moved right along without any real ""bog-downs"" - only a few scenes where the breathtaking pace eased a bit.

I should mention that I'm a 50 year-old veteran viewer of the horror film, and these days it takes quite a bit to set me squirming, but this movie did it -- the pacing was brisk, and there were plenty of anticipatory ""there's something behind that door""-type scenes that made me want to butt-walk up the back of the couch.

Sure, your disbelief will have to be suspended, but this struck me a fresh take on the fairly well-trodden zombie film genre. Turn down the lights, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the jolts - just be prepared to vacuum up the snacks afterwards...",1301875200,,908,4.496969696969697

This is actually a pretty decent horror film.  Flawed, to be sure, but I still liked it and could overlook its shortcomings....
The beginning was rough; it felt like a movie of the week melodrama.  The town drunk shows up at a ballgame loaded for bear: to shoot or not to shoot?  His widow giving the sheriff a halfhearted slap didn't help the pervasive sense of hesitancy on the part of the director.  Pick a genre, it's not that difficult: horror or something limp and whiny.  Eventually, they found the right tone and things began to percolate.  It also helped that there were three solid leads playing the most important characters: Radha Mitchell, Timothy Olyphant, and especially Joe Anderson as the loyal deputy.  It was caring about these people that made this movie work (an element sorely missing in the original movie).  The stand out scenes were: sewing in the morgue, the bedroom battle where the sheriff gets a good grip on a knife, the carwash, and the truck stop.
Not as appreciated were the endless walking scenes, the throwaway piece with the major, the BOO type scares, and some of the connecting scenes that made little sense time-wise.  Also, if you're on the run from someone, don't go walking down the middle of the highway in broad daylight!
I do think they could have done more with the herding of the townspeople into trucks and hauling them away, but that's a minor point.  I'm just glad they finally picked a direction and went for it.
It's a keeper (the original was not).",1300233600,,1680,4.680272108843537
3833801,4,B0021L8UXK,"Breck Eisner's ""The Crazies"" provides a lesson for our times - the mess may be bad, but the cure sure looks a lot worse.

Based on a George Romero flick, ""Crazies"" does not break much new ground in horror movies, but it does have something to say about the nature of evil.  An idyllic Mid-west small town seems just like any other idyllic Mid-west small town until the town drunk stalks into the middle of a youth league baseball game with his shotgun.  David (Tim Olyphant, ""Deadwood,"" ""Justified""), the town lawman, tries his best but when you're confronted with a shotgun toting drunk, odds are you're going to need to use your gun.

This tragedy might go unnoticed as a once-in-a-generation tall tale that you so often hear of small towns (""Remember the time when the cops gunned down that guy at the ballgame?"") if it weren't for the fact that across town a farmer burns his family home to the ground after locking his wife and son inside.

Something is wrong in Pleasantville.

Eventually David and his wife Judy (Radha Mitchell, ""Man on Fire""), who just happens to be the town doctor, begin the fight to save their town, only to have that fight circumvented by the arrival of The Government.  Unfortunately for David, Judy, and their neighbors, The Government appears much more interested in making this problem go away - by any means necessary - than with saving the town.  As far as The Government is concerned, the only thing worse than destroying a small American town with a Government-engineered biological weapon is to have the story break on the national news.

David, Judy, and their friends must not only survive the Crazies - who are only too happy to kill you in the most violent manner possible - they must avoid falling into the helpful, welcoming arms of Big Brother.  This poses an interesting question - where do you turn for help when the people who are in charge of helping you want you to disappear?

Olyphant has become one of our most reliable actors.  With a glare or a quick one-liner, Olyphant conveys a depth of character - and often menace - that draws you in.  When David makes an unimaginable offer to Judy, you believe him, just because Olyphant is that good.

""The Crazies"" is a violent movie, although not nearly as bloody as the plethora of other zombie films we've seen in recent years.  Tension rather than terror rules the day here, and that's a good thing.",1299801600,2,2400,4.640661938534279
3833862,3,B0021L8UXK,"I've had this movie on my hard drive for awhile to watch but thought it would be some cheap gory thriller with zombies. Surprisingly enough, when it came time for movie nights, my teenage boys weren't interested in watching it. So last night, while they were having a Back to the Future marathon (huh?) and my husband, who hates horror flicks, was out playing hockey, I put this on.

I was quite surprised because I found it to be a fairly good suspense flick, well worth watching, not a lot of gore (which I really don't like), actually not really any gore. And no zombies, well at least, no dead people who come back to life. For some reason, I don't like zombie films with the exception of Night of the Living Dead which I saw as a kid and which scared the crap out of me. Interesting that when I just googled Night of the Living Dead, I discovered that it was a George Romero film and this film is a remake of his 1970s film of the same name. I found this film to be a bit similar to 28 Days Later but I much preferred this one. In my opinion, less gore, less violence, better plot. But I do admit that I saw 28 Days Later quite awhile ago.

The Crazies is about a sheriff and his doctor wife who begin to notice odd things happening in their small farming town. People are doing crazy things. They discover that a military biological weapon is the cause of this contagious virus. Then the army moves in, rounds up all people suspected of having the virus, quarantines the town and non-infected people have to fight for their lives.

Timothy Olyphant plays Dave, the sheriff, and Radha Mitchell plays his wife Judy. The other central character is Joe Anderson who plays Dave's deputy. I found the acting fine, especially that of Dave. The pace is good, and it does keep you on the edge of your seat. But it was all the more interesting to me since I found it had equal suspense and action as it did 'horror'. Judy is taken by the military and Dave goes to find her. Then they and his deputy try to make their way to the nearest town where they believe they will be safe, confronted by 'crazies' on the way. There are good scenes along the way and the cinematography is really good.

All in all, a good suspense film, non-gory but fast paced and worth watching.",1298073600,2,2264,4.32
3833863,4,B0021L8UXK,"The Crazies is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same name directed and written by George A. Romero ( Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead fame). George Romero is the Executive Producer for this new film.  The movies starts off with scenes of a town in chaos, with burning buildings, houses, and cars.  We then switch to 2 days earlier, of peaceful shots of Ogden Marsh, a town with a population of 1260.  But, not for long...  During a local high school baseball game the local drunk, Rory,comes across the field with a shotgun in hand and a crazed look on his face.  Sheriff Dave Dutten (Timothy Olyphant) attempts to calm him down, but is forced to shoot and kill him, when he raises his shotgun.  The movie unfolds with various scenes of the town slowly descending into anarchy.  Husbands are burning their families, a doctor sews up his patients mouth, as people are losing their minds.  During this time, 3 locals find a dead parachuter in the swamp.  Dave and his deputy Russell (Joe Anderson) take a trip out to the swamp, and find a military plane under the water of the swamp.  Could this plane be the cause of the locals going crazy?

  The next 2/3rds of the movie, deals with the United States military quaranteeing the town; no one gets out, and no one gets in.  The military cuts the phone and internet service, and rounds up all the townspeople to the local High School.  Dave is separated from his pregnant wife, Dr. Judy Dutten (Radha Mitchell), when the military runs a scanner over her, and it goes off.  The rest of the movie deals with Dave, Judy, and Deputy Russell attempting to evade the military, and escape Ogden Marsh.

  I enjoyed the intensity of the film, as the small group escapes one intense scene after another.  The car wash scene was a favorite of mine, along with a brawl between Sheriff Dave and a doctor.  The director (Breck Eisner) definitely kept up the pacing of the film to keep you interested throughout.  As other reviews have mentioned, I also liked the actors interactions with each other.  Especially between Dave and his wife, and Dave and his Deputy.  As the desperation of them escaping escalates, there are great scenes making you wonder which of the 3 have the Trixie virus, if not all of them.  Timothy Olyphant is one of my favorite actors, and I thought he did an excellent job in this film.

  I just wanted to mention why I did not give this film 5 stars.  There were some glaring plot holes and ""leaps of faith"" required from the viewers.  For example, the military is supposedly watching all the streets and highways for townspeople, yet several times during broad daylight our group just marches down the highway with no one bothering them.  I know this is a fictional movie, but you would think they would be a bit more careful.  And definitely make sure you keep watching through the End Credits.

3833865,4,B0021L8UXK,"Some may say ""The Crazies"" (remake of a 1973 George A. Romero film) is a zombie film without zombies. The genre's basic rules are there, with slight differences as to the details of the story.

After a disturbing incident at the baseball ground that shocks the townspeople, David realizes that something strange and sinister is going on in this sleepy town, slowly turning the residents into ""The Crazies.""

As in his previous film ""Sahara,"" Breck Eisner has created effective set-pieces without relying on graphic violence, even though his techniques employed here are mostly familiar, even clichd ones with hackneyed jump scares you have seen countless times elsewhere (like peeping through a keyhole). Characters are rather stock types, but acting from the leads including Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell and Joe Anderson make up for that.

3833870,5,B0021L8UXK,"The Crazies is just a really wonderfully created suspenseful flick dealing with a cop and his pregnant wife running around town avoiding a mysterious disease that turns people into mindless lunatics.

Now I was never quite sure whether these diseased people were supposed to be zombies or just a horrible illness that turned regular people into psychotic killers.  I'm leaning towards zombies simply because I remember a few scenes that showed a certain strange look (a vicious green glow) deep inside their infected eyeballs.

Anyway the Crazies really does a *tremendous* job building into a solid, storyline-focused film.  I'd even go so far as to put it on the same level of quality as 28 Days Later.  Watching a select few lucky people barely escaping with their lives time and time again manages to keep your attention VERY well.

One thing I found a bit odd is that, when we reach the part when the military comes into the picture, they seemed completely heartless and didn't even care if they eliminated innocent diseased-free people.  Many times there wasn't even a DESIRE to see if the people were diseased or not- they just shot and fired and killed them.  To me that was just... really unnecessary and downright harsh.

I assume the reason for this was because the miltary (and perhaps, the government) *could*.  After all, we're talking about a disease outbreak in a small, mid-western town apparently in the middle of nowhere.  ""If you kill ALL the people, nobody will realize it -or rather, nobody will *care*- anyway).  Still, a LITTLE bit of compassion would have been nice.

This movie works so well on so many different levels. It is beautifully shot and could be enjoyed for that reason alone, but - and this is so rare in remakes - the narrative grips you from the start and doesn't let up. The basic premise is the same as the 1973 original - a government screw-up sees a small back-water town infected with a biological agent meant for ""the enemy"". What is so engaging about the remake is that the protagonists; the hard-case but sensitive town sheriff, his compassionate, pregnant wife and the edgy, loyal deputy -  don't seem like stereotypes, but characters we can empathise with. The sense of paranoia  is maintained  throughout as our heroes have to try to escape through a backdrop peopled with a) the crazies, b) gung-ho rednecks, c) understandably scared small-town people, and d) (most chilling of all) the millitary, charged with ""containing or eradicating"" the problem. This is the best film of its genre I have seen in a hell of a long time.

But as it moves further and further along, it becomes rather clear that the whole reasoning behind why the events in the plot happened, as well as the responses of people involved, are directly the result of stupidity.

Unlike the sort of ""on the fly"" stupidity in movies like ""House of Wax"" (2005) where you could possibly justify their stupidity in that they were in the heat of the moment, the biggest bouts of stupidity come from situations that had more than enough time for forethought longer than six minutes planning.

For example: the plane.  For the sake of avoiding spoiler (though it's not even that important a spoiler), I'll just say that a very important military airplane crashes in a location... and they don't even reach the area until some two or three days later.  It's a tenuous stretch, but it causes even more stupid decisions...

Like, the military suddenly swarming into town, busting into houses Iraq-style, and arresting EVERYONE and taking them to detention camps where parents are separated from children, and people are scanned.  People asking questions are told to shut up, and are occasionally beaten up with assault rifle butts.

Considering that they RELEASE the people they scan that are clean, it was completely not surprising that a bunch of rednecks in a truck SMASH into the compound, SMASH APART the ULTRA military defensive chainlink fence, and get slaughtered in the firefight... while also letting out ALL the people taken in the camp, infected and not infected.

So because the military didn't bother setting up patrols, or defensive borders, or even TELLING people WHY they are being rounded up like criminals or terrorists, even with a token lie in order to prevent panic, their entire endeavor collapses and tons of people have to die.

And EVEN WORSE than that, the thing they were scanning people for to tell if they were infected... elevated temperature.

And given that a pregnant woman in average health was detected for elevated temperature, I think it'd be safe to say this would be like testing people by spraying them in the face with dust and considering anyone who sneezes to be infected.  They don't even bother to realize that MAYBE she has high temperature because she's pregnant or sick or both or has a mild fever or maybe THEY'RE JUST A LITTLE HOT FROM BEING AMBUSHED LIKE CRIMINALS, RIPPED OUT OF THEIR HOMES, AND PUT IN A CAMP WITH A THOUSAND OTHER PEOPLE IN CLOSE QUARTERS.

So because of that level of sheer stupidity, along with their handling of people like terrorists, it's supposed to be a SHOCK when the people react violently, and then the infected escape and spread and they have to nuke the town.  Yes really.  They nuke the whole town.  Because they were too damn stupid to put more than six minutes of thought into a containment plan that would NOT cause wild panic and terror.",1291593600,6,2967,4.811023622047244

The seemingly docile and irregular townsfolk suddently have a thirst for blood and nothing can convince them otherwise, save for a blow from a shotgun. Things go from bad to worse when the military steps in, while a band of survivors and their troubled sheriff (Timothy Olyphany) try their very hardest to get out of dodge.

""The Crazies"" smells of much of the post-apocalyptic fare we've been treated to over the past decade or so and unfortunately does very little to steer itself away from the genre's cliches. To say you'll see every jump scare and grisly death coming is an understatement; unless you're new to the genre, nothing in this film will take you by surprise. Having said that, though, the film does a good job of keeping a feverish pace from the get-go. Director Breck Eisner doesn't waste any time and the result is a film that is lean, mean and efficient in its purpose. The cast also helps amp up the energy as well, with the ever-reliable Timothy Olyphant stepping up to the plate with a performance that overcomes many of the script's flaws (flaws which concern crucial character development). Not only is the experience of following the sheriff and his crew on their mission a thrill, it's also driven home with a realistic human element which, in the end, saves the film from itself

All in all, while ""The Crazies"" doesn't bring anything new to the genre, it at least serves as an efficient roller-coaster ride of a horror-flick.

3833898,4,B0021L8UXK,"A little like ""The Mist""...a little like ""30 Days of Night""...a lot like George Romero's 1973 original.  This highly entertaining remake of George Romero's classic is best suited for today's horror/sci-fi fans.  I gave it 4 stars because it hits on all but one cylinder...Romero's unique style that really doesn't need the Hollywood touch.  The acting was okay.  Timothy Olyphant as the sheriff and Radha Mitchell as his wife were credible, but the true acting performance was turned in by Joe Anderson as the deputy...very convincing.  There are creepy moments, lots of chills and tamed down gore.  The ""crazies"" are made even more scary via excellent makeup and effects.  Kudos there.  The story tries to branch off where no film has ever gone, but how many flicks are out there about the government covering up a catastrophic mistake they made?  Worth a watch...but not a second time.  The extras are great, especially two episodes of The Crazies motion comics.",1290902400,,964,5.0062893081761
3833899,3,B0021L8UXK,"Two reasons I wanted to see this film.  I like the films of George A Romero who made the original version of this film.  And I like Timothy Olyphant's new show.

The Crazies is about a town that goes homicidal after a medical plane crashes nearby and infects their water supply with a designer virus.  There are two real problems with the film, first is they spend no time establishing the characters.  They give you just introduce the supporting characters before their crazy scene.  Second, plot twist are derived only to create the next crazy attack.

Now with that said, it is an average fun horror film.  But I would say rent it or wait for it to hit cable.

Bonus Features:
Audio Commentary with the director

Behind the Scenes with Director Breck Eisner - an iteresting making of with the director, cast and others.

George Romeo tribute - an interesting featurette about Romero.  (The frightening part is the horror genre people talking.  It really reinforces the geek horror image.)

Make-up mastermind-Rob Hall: A featurette showing how one Crazie is made.

The Crazies Motion Comic Episodes 1&2 - These actually give some background on two of the incidents in the film but are really hard to follow.

3833900,4,B0021L8UXK,"A reinvention loosely based upon the George Romero classic of the same name, THE CRAZIES is about the inhabitants of a small Kansas town suddenly plagued by insanity and then death after a mysterious toxin contaminates their water supply.

I know you've seen it before: A small town is infected and eventually taken over by zombies, crazy people, the government, or any combination of these forces. A few survivors stick with each other in order to survive through the chaos, or, in this case, madness, around them. However, you'd be crazy to judge a film by whether or not the plot is original because look at AVATAR.

I like zombie/infection/virus movies, because they are usually entertaining and thrilling to watch, but I have not seen the original film by Romero yet, so I cannot compare this remake with it. However, the film does stand up well in the wave of the many, many horror remakes that have been released. It's a good horror movie because it has one key ingredient that many horror movies fail to ever grasp: The suspense.

This film manages to not overuse the cheap scare tactics, even though some are scattered here and there every now and then. There's also some genuine horror and tension here. There's one memorable sequence taking place in a car wash where I was on the edge of my seats. Almost everything in this film is done so well where an average horror movie wouldn't ever succeed in accomplishing half of it.

Timothy Olyphant is another key ingredient to the film's success. Although he has been in many films before, this is his first starring role and he does a great job at it. Radha Mitchell is his on screen wife who also gives us a sympathetic role with some actual acting in her performance. Joe Anderson and Danielle Panabaker are the remaining two ""main"" actors here, the former giving a crazy but good performance while the latter gives us a generic whimpering teen.

It's also good to know the craftsmanship also went to the look of the film as it did the script. I love the cinematography with its gracefulness, giving the film a stylish look and the soundtrack by Mark Isham is really heartfelt. And it's great to see director Breck Eisner get back to his feet after the box office bomb SAHARA. If you're wondering if the film has the social commentary contained in almost every George A. Romero film, you need not worry here. It's done in such a way the filmmakers did not push it down our throats.

Overall, this is how every horror movies should be, let alone remakes, although they aren't, which still remains to us a great mystery. There are some great and ingenious sequences in here along with tension and suspense. The gore is actually used sparingly, although when it does get used, it's really nasty. It's just a really bloody horror flick with intelligence and good film-making. Films like THE CRAZIES give us hope to the slowly dying horror genre. Let's hope Hollywood makes more movies like this.",1288656000,,2951,4.69825918762089
3833901,4,B0021L8UXK,"This is a movie that was released in the crest of a remake tidal wave.  And honestly, I cringe every time I hear about double dipping cinema classics.  This movie, on the other hand, was surprisingly well made.  George A Romero has suffered more unsatisfying remakes & un-official sequels of his work than almost any other filmmaker.  But where one of the better remakes like the 2004 Dawn of the Dead succeeded, horror fans felt that The Crazies would be another dull over-Hollywooded flop.  I can say that as far as remakes go, this is among the best.  The acting is top notch, the make-up design is refreshingly different, and the tension is well paced.

I think making a zombie movie - without rotting flesh make-up, without foggy cemetaries, and without the word ""zombie"" is almost impossible to do well - but this movie succeeds on all fronts.  Although Romero is the granddaddy of zombie filmmakers, he was making The Crazies something different from his Dead series.  This remake follows the same path - thankfully.  The Crazies could have cashed in on the current zombie craze, but only gently scratched the surface.  The Crazies remains neutral to the zombie phenomenon - neither milking the craze nor diverting the script to something completely different.  At times this movie feels more like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outbreak-Keepcase/dp/B002GIBVVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outbreak (Keepcase)</a>&nbsp;than it does&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B0002IQNAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition)</a>.

But as the zombie debate goes, the citizens of Ogden Marsh are infected, but you can decide what they have become.

Having the movie in small town post-9/11 America, seems somehow more effective in 2010 than it would have been 1973.  The scare of disease outbreaks and military quarantine situations seems more realistic which adds an element of fear that I didn't appreciate in the original.  For Romero, I will always affectionately hold the original The Crazies near and dear to my heart... but, the 2010 remake feels more horrifying and satisfying.  I would say if you are on the fence to buy this movie, then rent it first.  But as a whole, I think most horror fans will find that it's better than expected.",1288569600,,2589,5.892761394101877
3833922,4,B0021L8UXK,"I have never seen the original ""Crazies"" film so I can not comment on which version is better. The Crazies(remake)takes an overplayed zombie genre idea and tries to make it more realistic. The story is told simply with a plausible background story. Instead of hordes of zombies running around like supercharged baboons or sloth-like undead roaming aimlessly, these ""zombies"" are alive and act fairly human(at least from a distance), but have a pretty mean disposition. Depending on how far gone they are, they can almost seem normal...I said almost. What makes it seem much more real is that they still seem to have a little memory of the former selves and react to people they know. The special effects and gore are played down a notch, but it doesn't make the film any less frightening. This is largely because the ""zombies"" are the least of your worries! I'm a fan of some of the classic zombie films and there have been a number of good ones in recent years, but The Crazies is one of the few that made me think could this happen? ...and that's pretty scary in itself!",1288569600,4,1072,4.647368421052631

3833926,5,B0021L8UXK,"Ever wonder what a ""real"" Resident Evil movie would be like if it was truly based upon the video games in which it steals the name from?  The major premise of the Resident Evil games lies within the sudden outbreak of a virus spreading throughout a local town.  In an attempt to cover up the virus outbreak, the government decides to nuke the city in attempts to not only keep the virus from spreading, but also to cover up the fact that they were responsible for the outbreak in the first place.  While all of this is happening, a group of survivors who have yet to be infected fight for their lives against the hundreds of infected humans within the town.  That is the basic plot of Resident Evil the video game, and that is the basic synopsis of the film ""The Crazies"".

The film begins by showing a small, simple town by the name of Ogden Marsh, Iowa.  It's a simple town, where everyone seems to know each other and everyone is enjoying a nice day out watching a local baseball game.  That is until the ""town drunk"", Rory, wonders out onto the field in the midst of the game carrying a shotgun.  Local Sheriff David Dutton (played by Timothy Olyphant) is forced to draw his weapon and shoot the man or risk getting shot himself.  The man's family does not take David's action too well, and blames the Sheriff for the man's death stating it had been years since he had any alcohol and was very proud of being sober now.  After the blood work comes in, David finds out that the man had zero alcohol in his body at the time of his death, meaning something else drove him to the breaking point of sanity.

The next day, David's wife Judy, the local doctor, is examining a local farmer by the name of Bill.  Bill seems to be in a trance like state, ignoring when others speak to him and simply repeating the same phrase over and over again when he is asked to answer questions given to him by Judy.  She finds nothing wrong with the man, and sends him home with his wife.  That night, however, Bill loses control of himself and brutally murders his family.

The next morning, David and his Deputy Sheriff Russell Clank go out to the local swamp to respond to a report of a dead body being discovered.  The cadaver appears to belong to a pilot, wearing traditional pilot's gear, so the two officers decide to search for a plane within the water.  After discovering the plane, and seeing how large it is, the two cops are confused as to why nothing was reported on either the papers, the internet, or the news, in regards to such a large plane crashing.  Immediately after discovering the plane, it appears as if the town's connection with the outside world has been cut.  No longer receiving a dial tone on their land-line phones, or cell phones, and no longer capable of connecting to the internet, it appears as if the town has been isolated from the outside world.

As time progresses, David and Russell discover more locals have become overwhelmed by anger and violence.  More murders begin to occur, and no one seems to have control over their actions anymore.  David tracks the outbreak back to the plane, stating it must have been carrying something that contaminated the water, and decides to shut off the water for the entire town in order to prevent the outbreak from spreading.  Shortly after doing so, the government shows up and the town learns the truth behind the outbreak, all the while trying to fight off not only ""The Crazies"" but the armed forces as well.  Chaos ensues, and no one is safe from anyone, even those who once appeared healthy begin to show signs of contamination and give into their feelings of anger.

""The Crazies"" depicts the outbreak brilliantly, starting off slowly and building tension as the film progresses.  The homicidal acts depicted by ""The Crazies"" within the film are truly shocking and horrific.  The scenes leading up to these acts are well drawn out, slowly building tension as the audience simply grimaces and waits for the murders to occur at a very well done, slow pace to build up anticipation of the next move.  With everyone slowly changing, it is hard to know to trust, once again contributing to the overall tension that the film delivers.  The large variety of environment is well done as well, varying from small town homes, to larger empty building, dark streets, and even a car wash.  There is never a huge break in the action and chills, but the film still allows for plenty of plot and character development while at the same time keeping a good pacing and spacing between the next horrific and violent scene to show up.

Overall, ""The Crazies"" is a great film and is very much like other films before it such as ""28 Days Later"".  The difference is that ""The Crazies"" does a good job of keeping the audience on their toes, provides a well developed plot-line, and still has a nice balance between violence and action, in order to keep the viewer intrigued throughout the entire film.  Never going too far in any direction, ""The Crazies"" does a great job of providing an equilibrium and stays balanced from start to finish.  The actors do a great job, especially Timothy Olyphant (David) and Joe Anderson (Russell).  The audience can feel the desperation that these survivors are feeling, and truly feel the intensity of the circumstances that the survivors are facing at every turn.  The atmospheres are well done, adding a dark ambiance to every scene, building suspense to greater heights.  ""The Crazies"" is an excellent addition to any horror collection.",1285545600,,5521,4.614124872057318

While the old car is being pulled through the wash, some infected townsfolk attack in a scene that would've made me pee my pants if I were younger.

They soon find that the town and its surrounding acres will be destroyed and they along with it.  This made me keep thinking , ""What would I do in this situation""?

The biggest name in this film is Timothy Olyphant in the lead role as sheriff of small town Ogden Marsh, Iowa (population 1260).  The rest of the cast and the director, Breck Eisner, are not quite as well-known, but they all do a very competent job.  The acting and the directing are so well-coordinated that you never have the feeling the film is trying to ""showcase"" a particular actor, nor that the actors are ever competing with each other for attention.  That, along with the pace of this film, which to me seemed just perfect (transitioning very gradually from casual to almost frenetic as things fall more & more apart) really allows the viewer to suspend disbelief and immerse yourself in the story.  And there is plenty of story.  There's plenty of scares too, but this film never loses sight of telling a story, focusing on a small group of people trying desperately to escape this town alive.  They have not only the ""crazies"" to contend with but also the military (in classic Romero style, the government is no more trustworthy than the disease).  The violence is just sufficient to maintain a real sense of suspense, without over-the-top or gratuitous gore.
The film is almost entirely first-person viewpoint, and along with the characters we learn that something is terribly wrong, people are going berserk and senselessly attacking others; that it apparently came from the cargo on a military plane that crashed in the marsh which supplies the town water; that it might have become airborn; that the military is rounding up and quarantining everyone; and finally, that nobody is going to be allowed to get out...
There are also plenty of head-fakes in which you don't know whether something awful is about to happen or not, but these too are done in a reasonably sophisticated way, not overly calling attention to themselves but just keeping you constantly on-edge and not knowing just what's coming next.
The blu-ray looks great and the musical score is good, particularly at the ending credits.  There are a moderate number of ""bonus features""; three short (10 minute) featurettes being the most interesting to me.  This was really filmed in Iowa, as well as in rural Georgia (enabling filming to avoid the cold Iowa winters and the hot Georgia summers).  The whole story takes place over just a couple of days.  I'm doubting there will be a sequel although the final sequence left open the possibility.  This is a very nicely-done horror film with good characterization and a somewhat understated style.

When the DVD arrived, I was skeptical about what I had received, because there was no mention of any UFC fights on the cover.

Guess what?  It had nothing to do with ufC.  It was a horror film.  My wife and I aren't into horror films so much, but we watched it anyway.  Might as well, since we own it now, right?

3833989,4,B0021L8UXK,"If you don't like zombie films, you'll find yourself sitting through this one, albeit sometimes reluctantly.  It has all the modern setups of a classic zombie film, but includes enough plot and character development that you start to flip out any time someone is threatening the heroes - ANYONE.  Those heroes would be the Sheriff and his doctor wife.

A flashback starts the film with the town being a burned out mess.  It looks like Armageddon, so you know what to expect.  The story then begins when things were normal.  I won't spoil the rich plot, but it includes a scary beginning where the sheriff has to shoot someone at a public town game when he approaches everyone with a rifle.  He is the first `crazie'.  People start showing up at the doctor's office one after another, `not being themselves'.  The weirdness escalates with other bizarre behavior; a man trying to burn down a house with his wife and child inside, hunters finding a government plane in the local pond, a theory of water contamination and hoards of more scary, grisly killings.

The military shows up and starts rounding up the crazies with the non-crazies, which is a real treat for these who are still sane.  Some of the healthy are strapped down in gurneys as crazies approach, and well.  It's pretty gory.  Finally the crazies get out of control and the military screws up and everyone gets loose.  It's a wild ride.  There are some great scenes including some non-crazies being trapped in a car going through car wash (very clever) and a nifty car and helicopter chase scene to mix in with all the bloodshed.  It does get to you after a while with the relentless carnage.

Of course, in all these disaster movies, the big question is who will survive?  It must be the good sheriff and his doctor wife. Right?  Well, some survive and others don't, like any good zombie movie - you just never know.  The ending is classic as well.

""Crazies"" doesn't even give lip service to an explanation for why the virus behaves how it does or how it gets out of control.

3834033,5,B0021L8UXK,"When kickin' it in a small town, you expect small town things to happen. you see the same things in the background, notice the same people and the same schedules, and you grow to know how to relate to the same people. What you don't expect is for the world to turn an emotive 180 and for people to start going a little mad, taking to household and street alike with something horrible infecting them.

When The Crazies came out, I was thrilled to see it. I wanted my sheriff to go and lay down the law on a lot of nuts, and he did get that chance. The key is to remember that they are infected with something, too, and that they aren't going around and getting out coffins or anything like that. He and a few other people do their best to hold on and remain ""sane"" as things get progressively bad too, and they battle a lot of rage-filled people. These fights take place as our leads try to tend to wounds, try to save families, try to save other people, and try to save themselves. And, well, they dwindle like any bipedal river would when you start picking off piece of it.

Expectations were high for this movie in some circles - you to see the hype that went on as the movie got closer to the relse - and i think that hurt it a little. From the onset you knew what the movie was about, so plot is down to twists and then you have gore and those lovely little moments when you move from your chair to the skyline. I personally thought the movie was really good in a lot of ways, too, and moreso since I didn't really expect a remake horror film to do well at all.
I know it is a remake of obscurity and the 70s when I write this as well, but remakes haven't been the greatest when it comes to track records. Still, this seemed nice and fun to me.

One thing it relies on is the fact that you do not know who is infected and you don't know behavior from stress relations or from viral relations. That basically means you could be sitting next to the person that might well want you dead, or it could mean you are over-reacting. In the movie it even seems to imply that the infected don't really notice how gone they are except for some brief moments of clarity, so that comes into play as well.

Regardless of what has been said, I thought the movie was good and I enjoyed it. As i noted before, you know what to expect and you have a lot of moments you can almost ocunt on. If, for instanc,e people go into some place with doors, something is bound to be there. You simply get stuck with the brain power of your people here - and whether or not they can think themselve sout of a town that is killing everything, troopers included. Add that to an ending that isn't very nice and you have a movie i liked enough to rate around a 4.5 or so, rounding it to a 5.",1282003200,,2761,4.107407407407408

The movie starts out showing a town in flames, then quickly jumps to ""two days"" earlier. The action starts rather fast. Character is built during the action scenes. A man with a shotgun walks out into center field during a baseball game. After a brief confrontation, the sheriff has to shoot him. Soon another man goes crazy and burns his family to death. The sheriff quickly figures what has happened as they find a downed plane in the marsh which supplies the drinking water to the town. At this point the movie had the feel of ""Impulse"" (1984).

 When they go back to town the cell phone doesn't work, nor can they get on-line. The sheriff recognizes something is wrong and ventures out into the street of the deserted town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa. The military comes in and rounds up people into camps/ separating out infected and non-infected with an ear thermometer. The sheriff and his wife lead a small group of people out of the area, believing that if they could just make it to Cedar Rapids, they would be fine.(Death or Cedar Rapids is coin toss for most folks.)

 Meanwhile they have to battle crazies, hide from the military, and watch each other for signs of being crazy. Radha Mitchell is this generation's Lynda Day George. The acting was above par for B horror. There are some different killing scenes then the normal slasher films. My favorite was the guy dragging the pitch fork (cover) into a hospital room where the patients are strapped into beds. The pitch fork grates along the floor like chalk on a blackboard.

Okay, so they marketed this as a horror movie (some dude with a pitchfork appears on the movie poster, which foreshadows the only trully awesome scene in the movie, if you ask me).  When I thought ""The Crazies,"" I was thinking zombies and brain-eating, not some government-engineered virus that renders people catatonic and extremely violent and homicidal in an effort to ""destroy society.""  The government virus thing has been done already, and just the fact that the government and the military have gotten involved at all clearly spells out the fact that these doomed townspeople have not a hope in the world.  But well, who better to challenge government officials than a cop and his wife?! It's too predictable: you just know that the married couple will be the only survivors of the virus... And of course the wife is pregnant so we can all root for their ""family"" a little more.

I can't actually remember how they escape catching the virus, which I blame on the fact that I was so bored I was just drifting in and out of the plot -- maybe they just take a lot of vitamin C...who knows, and I don't particularly care since it's painfully obvious that somebody has to escape. In between there is a pretty spectacular impalement-via-pitchfork scene, something involving a table saw, the ""kill yourself and save your friends sacrifice"" that always seems to accompany apocalypse films, and a few scenes in which we glimpse the crazies before the actors do, ala Mike Myers in Halloween, which would be fear-inspiring except that it's done more than once, so the ""gasp"" factor deflates quite a lot. So to make a long story short, everyone dies except our power couple, who attempts to hike into the nearest unaffected area, carrying all their lovely viral phages (or whatever the heck this thing is) with them.  But the government is watching them, and they presumably have guns, so maybe they can help us all avoid ""The Crazies"" Part II"" by shooting them down.

Whilst attending the first day of the spring baseball season, Sheriff Dutton is confronted by an apparently disoriented local man who wanders out onto the Diamond wielding a shotgun.  The Sheriff is unfortunately obligated to use what police forces all over the world choose to refer to as ""lethal force"" in order to stop the man. But this is just the first in a series of incidents in which apparently otherwise sane members of the town's citizenry succumb to bizarre fits of mania and, before long, the Duttons find themselves caught in the middle of an escalating epidemic of insanity...

Horror film remakes are always a dubious quantity. In my experience, the better ones generally tend to mine the concept and the strengths of the original and rework them in a way that puts a new spin on an old standard (Zack Snyder's excellent remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead-Widescreen-Unrated-Director-s-Cut/dp/B0002ABURA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)</a>&nbsp;is an excellent example of this). Rather mystifyingly, the remake of ""The Crazies"" does rework the concept of George A. Romero's original film but chooses not to play to the original's strength (which was to devote just as much screen-time to the architects of the mania that have consumed the small town as to it's victims). The net effect of this reworking is that the eerie, verit style, amateurish plausibility of the original is eschewed in favour of a series of rather boring sub-standard horror film clichs and histrionics which will be familiar to anyone who has seen a horror film of this variety in the last forty years.

Then there's ""The Crazies"" themselves: in my opinion, frankly, they're just not crazy enough.

Maybe I've been spoiled by the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Weeks-Later-28-Days-Later-2-pack/dp/B000TJBN8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Weeks Later / 28 Days Later (2 pack)</a>&nbsp;and Garth Ennis'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crossed-Volume-1/dp/1592910904/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crossed Volume 1</a>, but I am firmly of the opinion that, if you're going to make a film about people becoming psychotic, homicidal maniacs, then the psychopathology and homicide with which you're concerned should actually be up there onscreen and in spades. The first ten minutes of ""28 Weeks Later"" had me on the edge of my seat (and I remained perched there for more or less the entire running time of that film) but I found myself suppressing yawns of boredom at the tedious antics of the so-called slavering maniacs in this film.

Performances are negligible. Timothy Olyphant recycles his stiff-legged Seth Bullock walk from ""Deadwood""; Radha Mitchell does her usual sweaty, screaming blonde bit; a chap called Jeff Anderson outshines them both in his role as a goateed Sheriff's Deputy, but no one else really stands out in any way shape or form.

""The Crazies"" is a missed opportunity. The kind of film you're likely to fall asleep during if you decide to watch it on TV late at night. About the only thing that raises it above a one-star review are some decent production values and a superbly eerie score by ""Hitcher"" composer Mark Isham.

So with The Crazies you have a remake of an apparent George A. Romero original that surprisingly I'd never seen or even heard of. Not surprisingly The Crazies has a government conspiracy gone awry that turns ordinary people into crazed loonies (like zombies). Surprisingly they got a great talent like Timothy Olyphant to sign on for the lead in the film and he is a stand out. Not surprisingly one man does not a great movie make, and The Crazies falls apart by its finish with the notion that the government will not only commit mass atrocities of epic proportions on its own soil but would be able to keep it all on the down-low from us silly citizens.

The Crazies does have its creepy moments though. I admit that I was entertained. And Olyphant and even costar Radha Mitchell turned in excellent performances; they saved the movie from being utterly unbelievable and silly. And hey, I can do silly. But you don't want the silly label unless you're trying to be silly, right?

What made Romero's 1973 version of the film so successful is the context in which it was made, in a frightful era following Vietnam where the threat of global terror and biological warfare loomed overhead. Romero was one of the first to tackle these fears through the safety net of the genre, whereas Eisner's update comes decades later when the threats have all but been eliminated and the theme has been retold countless times. Although each of the cast members provide serviceable performances, the poor attempts at humor, inane dialog, and empty plotting make this a chore to watch. What's worse, the lapses in logic and unlikely timing of events also make the film feel rushed and disorganized. Throwing in some mild gore simply isn't enough to cover these repeated flaws. THE CRAZIES remake is far too generic, too tame, and too shallow to leave any lasting effect on the genre.

I actually really enjoyed ""The Crazies"" (2010).  Briefly (very mild spoilers ahead), it is the story of a small town that gets infected with a virus and people start going crazy.  A military/mercenary (blackwater-esque) presence puts the town in quarantine.  The people not infected have escape both the crazies trying to kill them and the military trying to ""contain"" them.

The film was a little slow going at first, and I found some of the acting a little choppy/hokey; but by half-way through the film I was totally drawn in and compelled to keep watching.  The scares were tense and fun.  The gore was decent and enjoyable, but not over-the-top.  The CG wasn't obnoxious or distracting.  Overall, I'm glad I watched the movie.  I would maybe even watch this film a second time.  I think, as is typical with a film like this, my only problem with ""The Crazies"" was the lack of crazies.  They drop out of the story for what seems like long sections of the film.  I would have added in one or two more scenes with them, especially with the main characters walking out exposed on an open road.  I actually think there's a plausible reason for this, but to go in to it I would have to enter ""spoiler"" territory.

Good action scenes and some excellent ""boo"" moments.

George Romero is by far a legend in the film industry and has crafted some of the best movies of all time, there is no doubting that. While he is still a very active filmmaker his past films have been being remade with more to come I am sure. One of those films is ""The Crazies"" a remake that he actually supported and came on board as an executive producer. I always have hope for a remake when the original creator is involved or signs off on it, from the films of his that have been remade this ranks as one of the best. Still the film is not perfect and falls short of classic status, not to say it is not a good movie, it is.

We find ourselves in a small American town in Iowa I believe following the life of the town sheriff David Dutten and our day is starting off wrong. During a baseball game that the whole town seems to be at a man looking he is drunk, but something is off, not to mention he I wielding a shotgun. When Sheriff Dutten confronts him the man raises the gun and forces the Sheriff to shoot  him, killing him in the process. This is just the first of many strange things happening in the town, things like the town drunk. People start to act really weird with homicidal tendencies and such, like a farmer wanting to bun his family alive. Just when things seem like the can't be any worse then your neighbors wanting to kill you the government steps in to quarantine the town. Just like them to make your day worse or at least in the film, if it was me I am not sure, I guess they were doing the right thing for the rest of the world.

Director Breck Eisner does a good job of moving things along and really does not make more out of what the film is, a good survival flick. The film follows the Sheriff, his wife, his deputy, and a few others, basically your core group of bodies to kill off one by one. But even your simple group of people need to make it here by this time to survive film can be fun with good acting. This is were the film is strongest for the most part, our lead in Sheriff Dutten is played by Timothy Olyphant. He does a good job in this film making it very believable as does Radha Mitchell playing his wife. Now to make it short I will say every one in this film did a good job and was very believable, but it was Joe Anderson that was the show stealer. Joe played the deputy in this film and in my opinion gave the best performance, and the most fun.

Speaking of fun you know I love the gore and such in this film, always fun to see blood pouring out every where in a good flick. Also I must say that if you are expecting a zombie movie you will be disappointed. Although these people are similar to the undead they are still very much alive, they are just infected. It seems something leaked into the water and is causing people to resort to animal like behavior, wanting to eat and kill. So just know from the jump these people are infected and undead, zombie like but not a zombie night.

That being said, this movie grabbed my attention quickly because the acting turned out to be decent and the story was entertaining.

""The Crazies"" centers around a wrecked plane that spreads a contaminant into a small town's water supply and turns the population into homicidal maniacs. While the residents are busy trying to kill each other, the government moves in to cover up the situation and round up all the townsfolk who have been infected.  Now, let's be clear - the script is nothing super original, and this horror film will not win any Oscars; however you surprisingly find yourself being drawn into the chaos of the movie and pulling for the main characters to make it out of their insane situation alive.  Along the way there are plenty of scares, weirdness, and slice'em up, dice'em up blood-splattering violence to keep you from looking at your watch.

If all you want from a movie is a a few frights, some entertainment and suspense and nothing too deep, watch ""The Crazies."" The ending is also decent and in its own odd way, somehow almost believable.",1280016000,2,1312,4.618025751072961

Reminiscent of 28 Days later, and nearly all the Romero flicks with some Steven King thrown in (though as one reviewer put it, ""this is no zombie fest""). I consider it more comparable to the remake of Dawn of the Dead in how it intentionally seeks to connect to the viewer through ""Middle American"" imagery and settings to the mayhem that can unfold.

Of course, the film is very violent though not really in a gratuitous manner.  In a way, it seems as if the classic horror flicks of the 50's heavily influenced the film making.  I found the acting good to really good.  While the film was predictable (almost unavoidably), it was interesting nevertheless.  Of course it involves a government conspiracy, military experiment gone wrong, bad decisions, a side-kick, etc..

The plot, what there is of it, is a bit difficult to extract from all the mayhem.  It appears that, in a small Iowa town, some disastrous chemical/nuclear event has taken place.  Instead of letting the good citizens know what has happened and gently herding them away from the dangerous disaster, serious chemical suits are worn by an army of thugs looking for a good time herding up the good citizens, not telling them what has happened -- and generally beating them up.  I guess no one thought to just go on tne radio and TV and telling the truth.

The acting, minimal, is done by two modestly talented newcomers as the leads (I call them newcomers because I've never heard of Timothy Olyphant or Radha Mitchell).  But they certainly don't embarass themselves and Mr. Olyphant has a fine Greek profile which the director often presents to us.

3834192,2,B0021L8UXK,"(Warning: i'm french. I do my best with the language)

Okay. So it's not a Fellini film. It's not high art. It's a ""zombie"" movie (no matter what the creators say). Military experiment gone wrong. Virus infects village folks. They turn into killing monsters. A small group of people are trying to survive. You can easily get infected. It is a ""zombie"" film. Not that there is anything wrong with that. But don't try to call it something it's not (listen to the creators on the special features of the DVD deluding themselves). With that being said, I went in expecting nothing more than a normal horror flick. Good special effects. Looks great. And you have your normal scares. I kind of expected to see something a little unique (the kind of uniqueness that every other good horror film comes up with - you know, they have to do something different from all their predecessors - in that case, the look of the ""zombies"" and the crazy guy walking in the baseball field). I got pretty much everything I expected... and something more.

The acting.

Thanks mainly to Timothy Olyphant who plays the sheriff. He's so charismatic and credible that he makes everything believable.  He also makes everybody else around him look so much better. His casting was a wise choice.

You won't give any Oscar to ""The Crazies"" but you will enjoy it... if you put your brain to neutral. The minute you start to analyze it, you will find a couple of things that are wrong. Again, it's a commercial film so we should leave our note pads at the door. But then again, why wouldn't you want to do the best movie possible as a screenplay writer and a director?

For example:

The main characters. The couple that is. The Sheriff and his wife. They are no tension between them. They love each other from beginning to end. Normally, you would have them fight or maybe have them separated when it all starts. The fact that they have to survive and protect each other would make them fall in love all over again. You want to be original? Fine. At the end, they'd still be separated. There. But to not have anything go wrong between the two of them makes it dull for that kind of film. The tension then comes only from the outside rather than also from the inside. Yes, I know. We've seen the troubled couple in other films (""30 Days Of Night"" for example). In fact, we've seen it so many times that it is now a clich. But clichs became clichs because they were true and because they worked. You can always put a twist on the clich to make it original but going against it, well, you're calling for narrative trouble. In all disaster movies or horror films, the couple (if you choose a couple for your main characters) have to not only fight the monsters or the natural disaster but they also have to fight each other, thus making the monster or the natural disaster a metaphore for what they're going through as a couple. That is what Spielberg understood in the first ""Jaws"". The shark was only a motor of the action. It justified having three completely different people on a boat working their differences and inner fears or demons. But to have the Sheriff and his wife in love from start to finish is (in my humble opinion) the wrong way to go. I almost feel like it's screenplay writing 101. The ""crazies"" have to force them to work something out between them. It has to create am emergency. Don't you agree? Of course you don't.

On an other level (Now THAT is a problem), the ""zombies"". Okay, okay, the ""Crazies"". First of all, what kind of disease makes you become automatically a killer? The same thing happens in ""The Happening"" and countless other films. They're gonna have to start explaining that concept. Yes, crazy people kill others. But not all crazy people. Some just stare at walls. Some talk to themselves. Some dance alone or whatever. In these films, they all kill. Why? How so? Because the movie wants it? Not enough. And also, if they are automatically killers, why aren't they killing each other? What? They're crazy enough to kill everything around them but they're intelligent enough to select? The minute you become a ""crazy"" person, you kill and you kill only the healthy? Might as well do like the ""Body Snatchers"" and start yelling and pointing the minute you see a normal person...

No? Of course, you're going to disagree with me. But please, if you do, have some solid arguments. I swear, I will agree with you if you convince me otherwise. Did I miss something? An explanation in the movie?

Anyhow. Like I said, the movie is still better than average and you certainly won't be jaded about it (thanks mostly to Timothy Olyphant). It's just frustrating when you have intelligent and talented people working on a film and not doing their best to come up with something truly original WHILE remaining a little clich and mainstream. Cause at the end, it's not Fellini (and I wouldn't want it to be) but that doesn't mean it couldn't be the ""Fellini of horror film"". Or something like it. Why wouldn't you want that as a creator?

Then again, maybe I'm just crazy.",1279497600,2,5067,4.569383259911894
3834193,3,B0021L8UXK,"When George Romero made The Crazies in 1973 it was a response to the government's actions in Vietnam. There was a distrust of the military and a fear that uncontrolled power would ultimately lead to destruction. Some of this feeling comes through in Breck Eisner's 2010 remake but not enough to really cause any deep discussion of the subject.

There is something amiss in the small town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa that is causing its citizens to become more and more violent. Sheriff David Dutton (Tim Olyphant) discovers that the problem relates to a biological weapon that has found its way into the town's water supply. From that point on we have a pretty standard horror film with some nice twists that does more correctly than incorrectly. Good support is provided by Rhada Mitchell as the town doctor and Dutton's wife and Joe Anderson as an infected deputy.

The Blu Ray disc offers the film along with a lethora of extras including a making of featurette, a segment on the the George Romero template for horror films, two of the motion comics that provide character backstory and more.

A great feeling came over me as the credits rolled when I realized this was actually a modern horror movie I could proudly champion and add to my beloved collection. The original 'The Crazies' from George Romero was a valiant yet ultimately misguided attempt to capture the horrors of a pandemic outbreak on film and had too many boring scenes of scientists sitting around arguing with each other for most of the running time. This new version of 'The Crazies' wastes no time getting the horror in order. Director Breck Eisner masterfully delivers a rousing tale of realistic pandemic horror filled with old-fashioned genre techniques and a strong sense of urgency. He introduces us to characters we instantly care about and can easily sympathize with, while not compromising the movie's confident pace. There are MANY shocking and horrific scenes on display as well as plenty of scenes of utter nail-biting suspense! The script is punctual, succinct and doesn't talk down to the audience (a perfect example for aspiring screenwriters to study). It wisely avoids predictable cliches, isn't bogged down with the usual overbearing political correctness, and embraces the scenes of raw horror with sheer exhilaration! The cast is excellent and there are no weak links in their performances. The 'crazies' themselves are truly horrifying and the copious bloody FX are all very well done yet not gratuitous.

(I don't care much for the original 1973 movie.) The zombie humor is pretty subtle. Some of the characters' costumes are amusing, but you're going to have to appreciate that without much prodding from the filmmakers.

Is The Crazies worth your while? Most definitely. I really enjoyed it. Of these recent spate of zombie movies, I'd rank it very high. The Dawn of the Dead remake being my favorite, I would rank The Crazies as #2. 28 Days Later would probably come in at #3.",1279152000,,806,4.52054794520548

3834200,4,B0021L8UXK,"With all of the remakes, reboots, and re-imaginings of classic (and some not-so-classic) horror films, I was a bit hesitant to watch Scott Kosar, Ray Wright, and Breck Eisner's version of George A. Romero's semi-classic ""The Crazies.""  Kosar and Wright updated the screenplay, moved it to a new location (Ogden Marsh, Iowa) and generally maintained the essence of the original film.  Director Eisner keeps the film interesting by mixing equal parts of suspense and action with brief quiet moments between the primary characters.

The film starts at a baseball game in the heartland of America.  During the game, Sheriff Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) has a tense encounter with a local named Rory Hamill, who pulls a gun on Dutton and the sheriff is forced to shoot him.

While at home with his pregnant wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell), Dutton considers the shooting death of Hamill.  Judy consoles him and he eventually goes to bed.  He's awakened early the next day by the fire department when they tell him another resident has set his own home on fire with his family in it.  More bizarre events begin to occur as the day wears on.  Some citizens begin to ""zone out"" while others begin to act out violently.

After a bit of investigating, the sheriff demands that the towns water supply be shut off.  Then the military shows up and begins to lock down the entire area.  Citizens are divided into two classes:  those who show signs of the virus driving people insane and those who appear to be fine.  The townspeople turn on the military and each other, and soon it's every man for himself.  Dutton, his loyal deputy, Russell Clank (Joe Anderson), Judy, and her medical assistant, Becca (Danielle Panabaker), try to evade the military and the violent townsfolk in order to escape the chaos, but they soon find the odds stacked against them and their chances of survival quickly dwindle.

While many people want to classify this film as a zombie flick, I have to say that the ""villains"" in this film are a much more lively, much more terrifying bunch.  The virus that affects the residents of Ogden Marsh makes them bloodthirsty and violent, but they manage to keep enough of their wits about them to become real threats to those who aren't affected.  The infected don't lumber around in mass groups.  Instead, they gang up and hunt those who haven't succumbed to the virus, often with revenge in mind.  Others continue to do their normal daily routines and hobbies, but with deadly consequences for those who get in their way.

What I enjoyed most about this film is that Dutton and Clank aren't portrayed as stereotypically dumb lawmen.  Instead, they almost immediately realize what the cause is for their neighbors and friends' bizarre behavior and attempt to save as many people as they can before the military quarantines the area.

Olyphant and Anderson shine as the lawmen in this film.  Mitchell is sufficient, as is Panabaker in a somewhat small role.  Supporting players such as Larry Cedar as the Principal Sandborn and Christie Lynn Smith as Deardra Farnum give solid, albeit brief, performances.

When you boil down to it, ""The Crazies"" is just one more ""infection"" flick along the lines of ""28 Days Later.""  However, it stands above most of the other films in this genre due to smart characters, above average acting, solid direction, and a decent script.

One thing is very clear Only Romero can do Romero. Somewhere along the line this film lost entertainment value ( In my opinion) and lost a connection with the audience ( I would suspect). I have seen few films that are as utterly bleak as this one, with little or no redeeming qualities, and I am now including it on my list of films that I will not recommend under any circumstances. If you want a film that has a 80s feel ( or at least claims that) and has the brutality of what the CRAZIES aims for ( but fails) , but also has a entertaining and supernatural subplot, then definitely go for MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN ( unrated), since THE CRAZIES has no class, no fun, and no entertainment value.

The opening scene was chillingly unexpected, and the action didn't stop from that point on.  I was breathing hard just watching it, and by the end, I felt as if I had run a 20k!  The whole film is a 5-star tour de force, and the setting -- no-place-to-hide Iowa farmland -- added to its tense drama.  Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell were superb, backed up by a great cast of zombies, who set a new standard for grotesquery, without too much skull-sucking or brain-spattering.

The really scary group in this film is made up of our military first-responders to a homegrown disaster. Not sure which is worse:  the military or the disaster!  See the film and you decide.  I gave it 5 stars, bought the DVD, and put it in my dual collection of future cult classics and Tim Olyphant's filmography.",1278374400,,898,4.610062893081761
3834261,4,B0021L8UXK,"Something George Romero has always been good at is working comedy into his allegories which generally include zombies.  The Crazies is a remake of a 1973 film by Romero of the same name.  While the Crazies is a better shot and acted film, like almost all remakes of Romero films, they lost a bit of the heart and smiles during the remake.

Timothy Olyphant and Rahda Mitchell make for a perfectly fine leading couple, trying to escape both the infected zombie-like crazies, as well as the government hell bent on exterminating them (and everyone who knows about them).  What follows is a movie with a number of creepy scenes (a scene in a carwash and the oft advertised pitchfork scene ranking high among them).

There are zero laughs however.  It is a constant onslaught of gore and horror.

The crazies could be a horror classic with just a bit more heart.  As it stands, it is still superior to most horror movies put out in the last decade, but it falls just short of greatness.",1278374400,,982,4.571428571428571
3834262,4,B0021L8UXK,"As a life long fan of horror films I have long been a defender of director George Romero. Even the movies he's made that I'm not particularly fond of I've enjoyed for the originality if nothing else. Add to that the fact that this man has made movies outside of the mainstream of mass manufactured Hollywood and how can you not like him? So I was kind of worried when I heard they were going to remake his 1973 film THE CRAZIES. The fear was unwarranted.

The movie takes place in a small Midwestern town in Iowa where life is like a Norman Rockwell painting. People know one another, festivals are planned and everyone in town is gathered at the baseball diamond for the local high school match, including Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant). So what's the town to think when a local man wanders out onto the field carrying a shotgun and refusing to step down when the Sheriff orders him to drop his weapon? After leveling the gun at the crowd, he has no option left but to shoot the man.

This leaves Dutton wondering what ever possessed this man to act the way he did. But it doesn't stop there. That night another regular town's person terrorizes his family. Locking them inside a closet, he pours gasoline all over and lights the place ablaze. Taken in to custody, the questions keep coming...what's wrong with these people?

A little investigating on the part of Dutton and his deputy leads them to a swamp where a few poachers came across a body in a parachute hanging from a tree. Looking further into the swamp, Dutton and his group come across a large airplane sunk beneath the surface of the water and no clue as to where it came from or how it got here.

Things go from bad to worse as more outbreaks of strange, violent behavior happen. Cars are wrecked up and down the street and folks are killing one another for no apparent reason. Dutton, his wife and the town doctor Judy (Radha Mitchell), Deputy Russell (Joe Anderson) and nurse Becca (Danielle Panabaker) attempt to leave town only to be apprehended by the military.

It turns out that on board the plane was a toxic agent, code name Trixie (a reference to the original film), that would create mass madness if released. The contagion seeped into the town's water supply and everyone who had something to drink was infected. Now the military is sorting out who is and who isn't infected with nothing else to do but kill those who are.

An escape ensues and the foursome head out to escape not just the military but the by now infected zombie like people they once knew as friends. But the military doesn't want to risk the chance of the outbreak spreading and a hunt for the fugitives follows.

This movie offers a few scares that few seem to do these days. It doesn't really on gross out gore, though it features some, but more on the whole ""what if..."" scenario posed by the main idea. What would you do if your neighbors, people you had been friends with for years or even family members suddenly decided you'd be better off dead? How would you react to these attacks? And what would you do if the government was involved in not solving the problem without resorting to incredible violence?

The horror in this story involves people and humanity.  Knowing that people you care for are now something they weren't and yet still having deep rooted emotions for them makes for some powerful thoughts when it comes to deciding what to do.

The film offers some well done special effects that don't always go over the top but that should be enough to keep gore hounds happy and average viewers revolted but not too turned off to the story. The acting is top of the line and Olyphant is fast becoming an actor that we're bound to see more of.

One of the good things about a remake that works is that it makes viewers who might not been aware of the original source material seek it out. In this case both movies would offer an evenings entertainment for whatever price paid. This movie is one of those rare films, a remake that not only pays homage to its source material, but an enjoyable movie in its own right.",1278288000,,4084,4.505405405405406

The sets and setting were nice and it really felt like it took place in a small town. The special effects were really good and never looked cheap or too CGI. I feel like the makeup effects artists did a very nice job on this and the crazies looked like victims of disease; nice.

In the end, I liked the movie, but didn't love it. It was an average movie with pretty good execution, making it a 3.5 out of five.

(2.) Louisiana bayou swamps don't belong in Iowa. Fire pots in the streets, broken glass and a few turned-over cars with trunk/hood lids up to represent looting and chaos is cheap and really really old. Tall chain link fences used by the military to control a hundred people in a confined area just doesn't work anymore and wouldn't work anyway (my rabbit could push it over). Another cutesy ambiguous ending following the usual atomic bomb dropped on city visual.

3834265,2,B0021L8UXK,"This relatively small-scale remake of George Romero's low-budget thriller manages to deliver a few thrills, here and there, but never manages to do much that is truly inventive or original, and certainly never manages to convince me that a remake of the ultra low-budget original was necessary.  When the local drunk goes crazy with a gun at the local ballpark, and an ordinary man goes bonkers and burns his house down with the family locked inside, the local sheriff begins to suspect a pattern.  When a downed airplane is discovered in the local water supply, he figures out, connecting the dots perhaps too quickly to leave us in suspense, there must have been some kind of contaminant aboard.  Of course we know already the military's involved because from the first scene we have been shown that every significant ""crazy"" event has been monitored by satellite and other military surveillance.  The first thing that bugged me about the remake is that what's happening is so easily explained, early on, as the result of a military experiment gone awry.  Of course we don't yet know the details, but the thrill of discovery is denied us.  (I don't consider that a spoiler, since the premise of the film is familiar, and I'm only saying that the film gives away too much too soon - in a way, I'm saying the film itself spoiled a lot of what could have been interesting about it, too early on.)

For example, one intriguing element the film touches upon but never develops, is that the ""craziness"" alluded to in the title might in some instances just be an extreme version of the (perhaps) ordinarily bizarre and slightly psychopathic behavior of small-town disorderliness, the kind of minor illegality and extremism that a sane sheriff would know well enough to overlook for the most part.  (For a more original film that explores the possibility that small town extremism and psychopathia might border upon each other, see the very cool Canadian zombie flick&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pontypool/dp/B002TZS5G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pontypool</a>).  Drunken disorderliness turned vicious, for example, or the local poachers, who take advantage of the chaos to hunt some unconventional ""game.""  The cool thing about the premise is that these aren't zombies - they're not dead and they're not mindless - but the virus turns them into psychopathic versions of themselves, themselves without a conscience and with an impulse to hurt.  This version didn't explore or exploit that dimension as much as it could have.  I think it would have been much more effective to keep things unexplained and play up this element a bit longer, so that for a day or two you let Tim Olyphant as sheriff actually try to figure this out and let Radha Mitchell as his wife and local doctor come up with theories until they're over their heads and the escalation of ordinary people's everyday quirks into violence can no longer be explained away.  Only then would reinforcements come and only then would it become clear what they're dealing with and only then would it become clear that the military was aware.  I liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mist/dp/B0010X745K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mist</a>&nbsp;better, where the local craziness was the focus at first and only late in the game did the larger stakes become clear.

The performances were satisfactory, but the lines they spoke tended to be the product of mostly uninspired writing.  They said the obvious things, or voiced the emotional content of scenes that should have (and usually were) already been carried by the acting and the editing.  The one character who really stood out for me was that of Joe Anderson, the Deputy who easily upstaged Tim Olyphant in every scene they shared, especially as the situation went from bad to much worse.  I'd never seen him in anything before, but after this I'm convinced he could easily carry a film and will look for his future work.  The editing and look was fine, and the filmmakers had obviously seen a lot of horror films and borrowed liberally from the most intense moments (e.g. a guy drags a pitchfork that you know he's going to use to inflict violence, and the sound itself is both grating and horrifying - and which is, depending on how you look at it, a pretty direct steal from or homage to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Simple/dp/B001B1UO7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Simple</a>). On the other hand, there are a few fresh images here that had my heart pumping and my eyes intrigued - a scene in a car wash comes to mind, that was richly executed.  The ending was utterly predictable.  My wife predicted it about ten minutes into the film.  Still, it's not bad and could have been much worse.  Not bad, but not likely to attain classic status.",1278201600,,4903,5.194162436548224

Timothy Olyphant has been one of my favorite actors since ""The Girl Next Door"". Though this movie is on a smaller scale than say, Dawn of the Dead, it was still very enjoyable. Plenty of sudden, jump out of your pants, thrills to please horror fans. I myself enjoy monster movies more than slasher flicks, and zombies are right up there close to the top, though these people aren't technically zombies. I would say they're sort of like a 28 Days Later infected type of pseudo-zombie. This movie definitely had the disaster movie feel to it.

It is also scary and nail-bitingly intense........and..be still my heart...it has a pitchfork. Since this is a horror movie it's not used to bale hay down on Old MacDonalds farm, but then again the person to wield the pitchfork has a point(s) to make and you just know that those in front of the pitchfork will soon be getting the point(s).

The story takes place in a sleepy little hamlet in Iowa where the drinking water has been infected by an experimwntal biological toxin named Trixie. Soon some of the bland, ordinary townfolk become bland, ordinary crazyfolk. As often happens, army commandos descend on the town complete with hazmat suits and masks to cover their behinds and shoot and burn both sane and insane.  Some are swooped up and tied down on cots in a sort of a tented concentration camp.  But as often happens, army commandos are not good at guard duty and security is breached when a stray crazy armed with a PITCHFORK (be still my heart) scraping behind him, enters the tent and begins sharing his ""point"" of view with the tied down locals. Not really gory but a big ouch! none-the-less.

The yokel sherrif, his doctor wife and his Barney Fife of a deputy, who is slowly turning aggressive, spend the rest of the movie discovering what is going on-trying to avoid been sushied by commando assault rifles, and fighting off a band of redneck crazies.

The movie does meander a bit and there really is more a situation than plot but the movie is so well made and provocative--would our Government actually cover-up a snafu and nuke an entire town out of existence?

Considering the politics of the current administration, the crazies would probably be issued a stimulis check. (LOL)

3834318,4,B0021L8UXK,"""The Crazies"" (Overture, 2010)
-------------------------------
NOTE: Spoilers below
-------------------------------
While it might seem like ""just another"" zombie/pandemic horror film, this 2010 thriller is actually a remake of George Romero's 1973 film, ""Crazies,"" which was -- like his classic ""Night Of The Living Dead"" -- a trailblazer in the genre.  Here's what happens: a small town in rural Pennsylvania is beset by a mysterious illness that transforms good, normal cornfed Americans into mindless psychotic killers. Turns out it's a side effect of a secret government project gone wrong, and the Army is of course called in to clean up the mess. So this is in effect a three-sided horror film: the uninfected survivors have to contend with both their crazy-killer former neighbors and with a ruthless military operation which has issued kill-on-sight orders for all humans inside the quarantine area. Of course, this doesn't sit too well with the local sheriff (played by the charismatic Timothy Olyphant) or his loyal, capable deputy, who try to escape the worst of all possible situations.

In some ways this stylish, methodical modern film can be seen as an adjunct to the original, and not simply a remake: the action is less concerned with the government's point of view -- less of the crazies attacking the soldiers, and more about the soldiers exterminating the locals. Olyphant is good, but mostly its the narrative that keeps this movie moving along at a fast clip. If you go for this sort of film, this is definitely worth checking out.

I'm now in love with Joe Anderson thanks to this movie and have bought a few of his other ones! Tim Olyphant and Radha Mitchell also did a great job! If you're looking for a zombie movie, this isn't it. If you watch the extras on the DVD, you'll learn that they weren't trying to make this a zombie movie. They actually studied real-life diseases that people get every day and then took off with it from there, which makes it even more creepy. Give this movie a chance!

The difference between this and a zombie flick is that they don't eat you and they are a whole lot faster and smarter which makes for far more complex ""action"" scenes. If you just want to shut your brain off and soak it all up this movie is for you. The only thing that bothered me a little was that the ""good guys"" didn't spend the time scavenging better (military) weaponry that no doubt would have been left behind very early in the movie despite the characters being very capable, resourceful and smart. I couldn't help but think that seemed very unrealistic. And if they had acquired military weaponry it would not have altered their effectiveness or the story line so there was no reason not to write it in. I'm a real stickler for gun stuff in movies though and for most it would probably go unnoticed.

3834324,4,B0021L8UXK,"I am not about to pretend that a film like the Crazies is going to go down in cinematic history, it's simply not unique enough for that. But the film stands out because it is dark, violent and reasonably and understandably twisted. The production values behind the film alone are enough to make it stand out firm the pack if low budget schlock pushed on the unsuspecting public masquerading as a frightening film. The Crazies has the chops to scare, and that's ultimately it's greatest strength.

  Timothy Olyphant, in my opinion an actor who deserves only the best, plays the sheriff of the small town of Ogden Marsh. A plane has recently crashed into the swamp, poisoning the town's water supply with a pathogen that inspires homicidal behavior in the town's citizens. That's all the setup needed to justify the ensuing carnage and Olyphant's desperate escape alongside his pregnant wife, her young assistant and her boyfriend as well as his deputy. The small band is up against their former friends, now maniacs, and the military, desperate to keep the situation quiet.

  There are sequences of true terror in The Crazies, especially for those who have not seen trailers for the film (the scene in the abandoned farmhouse is genius). There are also enough gentle turns of the plot to keep you interested, but not stunned. The ending is very predictable, and is probably the lowest point in the film.

This remake offers us more of a horror element with z certain zombie like trait among them.
Gone from this version were the antidote scene, more of the military trying to catch the uninfected - with all the dead people I was wondering who was killing who and why.
All throughout the film there were piles of dead bodies - was this caused by the zombie like people who drank the water or were these zombies that were killed by the military
I never found the Romero version to be a true horror film with jolts & scares that this one offers.

The Crazies doesn't feature anything that any horror fan hasn't seen plenty of times before, but it features some genuine thrills and chills, solid performances from Olyphant and Mitchell, and a decent amount of political commentary to get its point across.

The sound is all over the place, keep your remote handy to turn the volume down when music is playing, and up when people are speaking.
The whole think looks very retro to me, which I think is probably the intent.
The storyline is cliched...disaster strikes a town, and most of its residents become violently crazy. They look like zombies, which is handy in figuring out the good guys from the bad guys. The government steps in to seal the town so that the illness doesn't spread. The hero and heroine of this tale are the handsome town sheriff, and his pretty wife, the pregnant town doctor. They are are (stereotypically) the best looking people in the whole town, and, of course, they are unaffected by the illness, unlike virtually everyone else. It is easy to predict what will happen next, and the music intensity lets you know when to expect something ""scary"".
Having said all that, the movie was fun and watchable, albeit funny rather than scary, for me, at least. The movie doesn't miss many ways to portray violent ways to kill people; particularly enlightening was the guy with the pitchfork killing tied up women. What struck my funnybone here was that the women were tied on stretchers with what looked like seat belts, and they were squirming to get free. The seat belts were not tied very tightly, and their arms were quite loose. When they were freed, the rescuer flipped the buckle with a little finger to loosen the belts, which the ladies could easily have done themselves with very little effort, but I guess the pitchfork guy was much more dramatic. It's fun to pick out the lapses in logic!

3834350,4,B0021L8UXK,"There is an audio commentary by director Breck Eisner who, rather appropriately, starts off talking about how he got involved in the project. He wanted the film's focus to be on the townsfolk, specifically David and Judy Dutton. He admits that initially he did not want to remake a Romero film but after watching the original again felt that he could increase the scale of it and update the premise to reflect contemporary issues. Eisner touches upon various aspects, including casting and locations, while also eloquently analyzing the film's themes.

""Behind the Scenes with Breck Eisner"" is a pretty standard if not well-made making of featurette that mixes interview soundbites with clips from the film. Eisner points out that an early version of the script he read had more of a balance between depicting the townsfolk and the military but he wanted to focus more on the town with an emphasis on horror rather than action.

""Paranormal Pandemics"" takes a look at how the filmmaker designed the infected. The original design looked too much like zombies and so they went for a more vein-y look. We see actors getting fantastic-looking makeup applied. Eisner explains the three stages of infection and expanded on Romero's original concept. They based the makeup on actual infections to give an added realism to the film.

3834351,4,B0021L8UXK,"Not having seen the 1973 original, I can only comment on this remake in relation to other recent works in the survival horror genre. To give credit where credit is due, George A. Romero is widely regarded as the father of the zombie genre and the original (and little-known) Crazies was probably fresh for its time. This version of The Crazies comes nearly 40 years later and definitely doesn't bring anything new to the now-crowded zombie buffet table. It is sticks to an old formula and delivers some solid thrills, without any surprises or deviations from the well-worn path set by other zombie movies. If you've seen the Resident Evil films, 28 Days Later,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mist-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B001AR0D4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mist (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] or played any of the games in the Resident Evil series or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Rising/dp/B000F3AADE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Rising</a>&nbsp;(inspired by Romero), you'll already be familiar with this film's premise: unnatural disaster strikes small-town America. A plane carrying a deadly cargo crashes in the woods, releasing toxins into the water supply of a small Iowa town. Instead of Raccoon City with the T-virus, it's Ogden Marsh with another virus. Different names, same results. People get infected and the military comes in to contain the infection.

What follows is a relatively straight-forward zombie survival flick as the three main characters try to flee the town while evading the military. The survivors are Sheriff David Dutton, his deputy Russell, and David's wife Judy. Structurally, the film is very similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invasion/dp/B00005JPUN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invasion</a>, another remake, and a bit like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Happening/dp/B001DZOC3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Happening</a>. People start off exhibiting emotionless vacant stares then become crazy and go about killing others. There is a lot of graphic violence, blood, and gore in this film, including trucks, morgues, and meat lockers full of corpses, but viewers used to zombie video games or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B0006SSOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>&nbsp;series will be in familiar territory.

All the townsfolk are pretty much disposable, without much character development. We don't get any depth to them, so it's easy to see them zombified and dispatched. The military, likewise, is also a nameless, faceless group that's just another enemy in the film to run away from. The origin and purpose of the government virus remains a mystery, and the ending quite obviously points to a sequel.

At 90 minutes, it is short, inconsequential, throw-away entertainment that doesn't ask too much of audiences. While Timothy Olyphant turns in a good performance as the sheriff, I didn't feel like I gained or lost anything from watching this film. There are a few cheap tricks like sudden loud music and pop-outs, but for the most part, the scares are honest. Overall, a solid zombie movie that will entertain if this is how you're looking to spend movie night.",1277596800,,3406,6.4

Director Breck Eisner and screenwriters Scott Kosar and Ray Wright have created an atmospheric, fast-paced, rather intelligent thriller with three-dimensional characters that evokes more memories of Holocaust movies rather than the films of George A. Romero.

The most frightening aspect of this movie is the military, and the way that they treat the people of the affected town.  Had it not been for the uniforms, at times I would have thought that I was watching scenes from SCHINDLER'S LIST.

Yes, there are zombies, but they are not the mindless kind that you find in Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  Nor, are they part of a flesh eating ""army"".

These creatures are your friends and neighbors, your husbands and wives, whose exposure to this strange toxin has turned them into killers.  That makes them all the more terrifying.

One man, for example, locks his wife and young son in an upstairs closet, and then sets the house afire.

The action sequences are very well executed and, I must admit that during the movie, I did jump in my seat more than once.

 Back in 2009 I had the pleasure of being on the set with the DP covering behind the scenes footage just for the DVD and promoting the film. It was anything you would expect from a set, they destroyed a small town, made it look like it was infected, and hired about half the town as extras.

 The biggest thing I remember was the director not wanting the infected to be called ""Zombies"" as they were in fact ""Sick People"" and needed to address the role as such.

The problem is that the previews are totally misleading. The ""Crazies"" are not the main threat in the movie. This is a smart, survival film... more in the field of Resident Evil than Dawn of the Dead.

The ""Crazies"" lost their ability to scare quickly. There are a couple decent shock moments, most notably the pitchfork incident, that are creepy.. otherwise, they become an after-thought as the film goes on. The final scene involving any of the ""Crazies"" is just plain dumb and does not add any fright factor into the film at all. I think they put the scene there to remind you that, oh yeah.. the title of the film is ""The Crazies"". The ending dragged out.. leading into an obvious sequel.

I seen this in the theater and left feeling less than satisfied by what I had just seen. The previews reminded me of ""The Village"" because you expect horror and this is nothing like it, IMO.

So we get an updated version, a more glossier, edgier, scarier update of the Crazies, i for one am not up for classics being remade. I just know somewhere down the line John Boorman's classic Deliverance will be remade unfortunately and Sleep Away Camp.

Anyways, this remake was actually enjoyable, as I do like the actors, Timothy Olyphant plays small town Iowa Sheriff, where people start acting in strange manners and soon whole town is in a pandemic except for a few who aren't affected like the sheriff, his wife and his loyal deputy ( Joe Anderson) who turns in a good performance as the deputy who soon starts turning into a ""crazy"" and so desperately trying to keep his grip on what is happening but knows he has the ""crazies"".

Then all hell breaks loose, Government guys come in, the town is under martial law, people getting executed by own government, people who are affected are contained.

This is A good thriller, but lacked what all Romero movies had, the social commentary, where back in the 70s when this was made, Romero touched upon, Government, Military, weapons, cannot trust your military. Stuff like that.
This is just an updated straight thriller/ horror, where it's selling point: quick scares, nice action sequences, cat and mouse chases between Sheriff and Military. A good pop corn movie over all, do no expect anything too deep, in fact I feel this could have been an X Files episode, whole Government Conspiracy crap and all.

Review Date: 22 March 2010

I never thought I would say this about a horror film, but here I think I have to; they may have made the characters too interesting! I'm serious. I really enjoyed all of the characters a great deal. They were all well acted, well cast and had a ton of depth and believability to them. So my only question is - why didn't the zombies?

Typically in these types of films (which I usually love), the characters are two dimensional and the film relies on the blood and gore to keep its heart pumping. Sadly, I would have preferred that in this case, because these zombies were crap!

The only reason that I even understand that they were supposed to be zombies, is because that's what everyone else has been referring to them as, and their make-up looks like what we'd find in any zombie flick. They were not at all the traditional living dead that I'm familiar with. They were not scary; they were just lame and annoying. I can appreciate that the filmmakers where obviously trying something different here with these zombies, and I have yet to see the original film, so maybe this is what people will expect and or appreciate. It just wasn't for me.

Our two main characters are played to a strong capital T, by two of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. Timothy Olyphant plays Sherriff David Dutton, and Radha Mitchell plays his wife Judy. They live in a small town in Iowa, where everyone seems to know everyone, and understandably so.

While in the middle of a baseball game, David has a standoff with a local who has a history of being drunk, as he stumbles onto the filed with a shotgun. After David has to kill the man to defend himself, we realize something is wrong and so does David. This guy was a little crazy, you see. Soon others around town start acting a little crazy too, and before we know it, the Military shows up to put everyone under quarantine.

Even after having watched the film, I still am unclear as to how exactly it is that you become infected with this virus that turns you into one of these so-called zombies. The film mentions that it stems from drinking contaminated water, which I got, as this is obviously explained to us. But how come one of the main characters goes `beep' when the military scans her with their `zombie detector' and she never turns? How come one of the other main characters starts to show some symptoms of being `crazy', but we never knew (at least to my recollection) that he drank from the water? And why has it taken him so much longer to develop symptoms than the others? I may be overanalyzing a film that's not worthy of it, but I'm only doing so because this film had the potential to be a lot more.

It certainly has its moments. The scene that took place in David and Judy's upstairs room was classic horror; I loved the bit with the knife. The scene in the carwash was gore-tastic and thrilling and the sequence with the run-away electric meat slicer put a smile on my face as well. But the zombies man! Come on, does no-one else agree with me that they were just plain boring? They didn't even make sense!

They were all different levels of crazy and sometimes killed people, started fires and even went so far as to tie people up while taking them hostage. Seriously? Zombies tying people up? WOW. Why stop there? Why not show the zombies having a picnic by a lake, or why not have them waiting in line at the town's movie theater to go see Dawn of the Dead? Either of these ridiculous ideas would have fit right in.

It's also one of those horror movies where even though you love the characters, you want to slap them for doing stupid things. How many more times could David have possibly left his wife alone somewhere with zombies running around? And why did they agree to let their friend walk behind them, at his request I might add, when he began to turn into one of the undead? At the very least they could have allowed him to walk ahead of them couldn't they?

Its movies like this that make you feel for actors who hopefully were directed to do these idiotic things. Even if they weren't, it's not their fault it's in the final version of the film.",1271030400,,4513,4.487804878048781

With a budget of 20 million (compared to the meager $275,000 in the original), this remake gnaws on some more fleshed-out ideas than the early 70's gem could offer.  It injects a very believable threat while exposing a provocative element of fear.  Although far from perfect, this doomsday thriller is nicely shot and unleashes some horrific moments upon the audience.

Although the virus outbreak dilemma has spread through countless movies over the years, few have the same sort of tense, spine-shattering images and predicaments.  Like American soldiers blindly obeying orders to kill.  Crowds being quarantined and transported like cattle.  Suspicions arising and distrust rampant amongst the entire town.  Just mass chaos as all lingering hope is brutally crushed.  This has some great kill scenes, like impalement by pitchfork, flesh-burning by blowtorch, and the threat of a circular saw.  Probably not for the squeamish.

Unfortunately this movie eventually suffers from the typical Hollywood infection.  Hard to ward that off in a big budget release.  Nothing too preposterous I guess, just the normal last-second bravado that seems highly unlikely.  There are some other minor plot holes littered here and there.  Slightly irritating, but not too bad.

Highly recommended to the casual horror fan.  Plus you Crazies will probably enjoy it.",1269388800,4,1426,5.380090497737557
3834404,3,B0021L8UXK,"The Crazies (Breck Eisner, 2010)

I am starting to wonder whether it is possible to effectively remake a seventies horror movie today. The problem I'm having with the idea turns on the cultural mindset of America. While I would hesitate to call what we have now ""conservative""--let's call it ""neocon"" instead--there's no denying that the cultural mindset of the seventies was (well, let's not go with ""liberal"", but say instead ""progressive"") vastly different than what we have now. That cultural mindset deeply informed such films as The Last House on the Left, The Hills Have Eyes, and The Crazies. We have had remakes of all three recently, and they have varied in their effectiveness, but when you compare the remakes to the originals, there is always a fundamental shift in tone. It is most prominent in The Hills Have Eyes, where the main character has been turned from a geeky wimp with a Sonny Bono mustache whom no one had ever heard of  (Martin Speer, a very good TV actor in one of his few big screen roles; he dropped out of sight entirely in the early nineties) to Aaron Stanford, a guy who's geeky wimpiness at the beginning of the movie is only conveyed to us by his father-in-law calling him (with undisguised contempt) a democrat. When the fur hits the pavement, though, he turns into your typical ""rah rah NRA"" kinda guy without much trouble. What I'm getting at is that the horror films of the seventies, and these three in particular, may not have taken incisive looks at questions of greater significance, but at least they knew to pose those questions and chew 'em around a little. (One could, of course, tack almost any seventies horror movie with a recent remake onto this, from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre to Dawn of the Dead.) The recent remakes, on the other hand, are content not to question, but simply to reflect. And so we come to the case of The Crazies, the movie whose sole purpose is to resuscitate Breck Eisner's reputation after the horrorshow that was Sahara, one of Hollywood's all-time greatest flops.

The movie concerns a small Iowa town where something gets into the water supply and turns the inhabitants into a bunch of, well, crazies. (While they're not zombies, you know Eisner has seen every recent fast-zombie movie, and plays them all to effect here; be warned.) Standing against the not-zombie invasion are the town sheriff (Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant); his wife, the town doctor (Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell); his deputy (Love Happens' Joe Anderson); and her secretary/assistant/something we never really understand (Danielle Panabaker of the recent Friday the 13th remake). They're not exactly handling it well. Enter the military, and if you thought everything was going wrong before...

While the military angle existed in the original Romero film, it is an entirely different beast here than it was there. The military are depicted as nothing more than goons, monolithic, indestructible, and for the most part faceless. (We see only two military folks' faces in the film. One is a drone, and the other some sort of high-level functionary, or possibly consultant.) While I'm not entirely sure that sort of thing plays in a time when The Hurt Locker takes Best Picture (which happened about nine hours after I saw this movie), Scott Kosar and Ray Wright, who loosely adapted Romero's 1973 script, are at least willing to give you enough ambiguity in one major scene to leave themselves an out. In any case, it's all very black-and-white; you've got the evil military and you've got the good guys, the local forces. Okay, I take back what I said before; that really is conservative, as opposed to neocon (where the military would have been flag-waving victors who were there to actually help). It's all also very cookie-cutter; you should see the ending coming a mile off if you've seen two or three flicks like this, or read a handful of zombie novels. Or, for that matter, Romero's zombie movies, though he's never been nearly that explicit about it.

As for the acting, well. Timothy Olyphant is a very, very good actor who makes very, very bad casting choices; in the past ten years, he's been involved in such ridiculous movies as Stop-Loss, Hitman, Live Free or Die Hard, The Girl Next Door (the Playboy Bunny flick, not the Sylvia Likens movie), Dreamcatcher, A Man Apart, and the Gone in Sixty Seconds remake. This is a better movie than any of those, but he still seems to do better on the small screen than the big (Deadwood and Damages have both been multiple Emmy winners over their runs). Mitchell, on the other hand, is a very, very good actress who makes excellent casting choices and then has the public ignore her movies. Even her foray into the world of Woody Allen, Melinda and Melinda, is probably Allen's least-known venture of the past decade. While she's gotten small roles in movies that got some notice (Finding Neverland, Phone Booth), when she's the marquee name, no one notices (both Pitch Black and Silent Hill were far better films than their gross would suggest, and has anyone in America but me actually seen Visitors, a phenomenal little thriller?). This could be the movie that changes that, since its critical reception has been generally positive. Anderson and Panabaker are not as experienced as the top-billed actors, and it shows. But their characters are both well-acted and likeable, if somewhat overwrought now and again.

The hinge for my rating, though, is that The Crazies, which was the tail end of Romero's trilogy of ""worst films ever"" (the other two, Jack's Wife and There's Always Vanilla, have faded into blessed obscurity in the forty years since their release; they're not at all worth hunting down, no matter how big a Romero fan you are), is kind of like an unmolded lump of modeling clay. It's got a few memorable scenes, but overall, if you were to put together a list of the five worst movies George Romero had ever directed, The Crazies would be on it. (Granted, it would be #5.) It's not classic Romero by any means. Had Eisner tried to remake a Romero movie that was actually good, he probably would have faced the same ire Tom Savini did in 1990, Zack Snyder did in 2004, and Steve Miner did in 2008 (the three directors who remade the original Dead trilogy). Instead, he adapted a minor work, he sharpened it up a bit, and he got a solid stable of actors. This is still a minor film, but it's a pretty good one. Eisner's reputation should lose some of the post-Sahara tarnish. ***",1268697600,,6499,4.787878787878788
3834405,5,B0021L8UXK,"Director Breck Eisner has taken the concept of George A. Romero's original movie, and produced a contemporary version of The Crazies that feels like the worst parts of Outbreak and 28 Days Later combined.  Better in every single way, terrifying at every turn, this is a nail-biter, an updated horror film that does not disappoint.

When a quiet, elder gentleman interrupts a high school baseball game by walking into centerfield toting a shotgun, the town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa is irrevocably changed.  With residents suddenly plagued by a mysterious sickness that turns them into psychopaths, the military springs into action, quarantining the entire town and attempting to stifle the outbreak by removing and immobilizing the sick.

Despite the fact that nothing is terribly original, the movie avoids being too predictable.  Scares jump off the screen from beginning to end, and the tone of the movie is believable enough to be ominous throughout.  Some of the scenarios in which the sick bound out after our heroes are completely unexpected.  The special effects are creative enough to add well to the thrust of the film without being Michael Bay level ostentatious.  The makeup and gore are top-notch as well, with blood, brain, and viscera splattering multiple times, accompanied by my approving applause.

Horror fans will love this movie, and I view it as redemption for an underwhelming predecessor.  I loved it from setup to explosive ending.  Be on the lookout for the pitchfork scene!  YIKES!

I left feeling satisfactorily terrorized, though I am still convinced that a single IRS agent has the power to inflict more pain then an entire crew of a horror flick...

Anyway, the premise of the movie is simple: a small town sheriff married to a small town doctor is puzzled when his small town folk start acting odd. Soon, his small town town is overrun with small town zombies being chased by big town soldiers. Can the sheriff save himself and his pregnant wife from the ensuing mayhem?

While not as brilliant and fresh as 28 Days Later, The Crazies is generously sprinkled with truly frightening moments. Yes, it relies on a story that has been told many times before, but does so in an unexpectedly proficient manner: there is no dialogue uttered unless it directly furthers the plot; the gore is aplenty, but never crosses into the realm of disturbing; the experienced actors Olyphant and Mitchell display the confidence of professionals who know we know they are there only for the paycheck, but still they want us to feel they have earned it.

3834407,4,B0021L8UXK,"THE CRAZIES is not a great film, nor will it likely even enter the ""Hall Of Fame"" of zombie-type movies.  However, it is a tight, well-constructed and reasonably well-acted thriller that is more than worthy of a look.

In the small mid-western town of Ogden's Marsh, high school baseball season is just getting started.  Everyone in town is there to size up the quality of this year's team...and frankly, life just couldn't get any finer.  In less than 2 minutes, we get learn all we need to know about this little town...we see that it's a town where everyone knows everyone.  Everyone has a place and is contented.  Life is simple but satisfying.  But when a glassy-eyed farmer with a shotgun wanders onto the field of play (actually, he has what might be described as a zombie-like stare), the sheriff (played at a perfect pitch by Timothy Olyphant) tried to talk him out of his weapon.  Their brief, tense confrontation ends in the death of the farmer...and the town is rattled.  Things quickly escalate as more and more citizens begin acting weird, violent and yes, CRAZY.

It isn't quite a zombie movie...no dead person is coming back to life.  In fact, it's more a cousin to 28 DAYS LATER, where the zombies were really just people infected with rage.  But whatever the case, we essentially see the very quick collapse of this little society...especially when the government quarantines them and begins to separate the sick from the well.

The movie takes a fairly predictable path from here...there's not really much we haven't seen before (although the film does feature the scariest journey through an automatic carwash that we've ever seen).  But there is seldom much in the way of the truly new in this genre...it's all in the execution.  If the film is constructed well enough, we don't pay quite so much attention to some of the plot holes (or if not holes, at least areas the stretch credibility, even if we accept the initial premise).  THE CRAZIES is well-constructed, and uses its modest budget well.  It doesn't attempt anything it can't pull off well, so there aren't lots of cheesy effects.  It assembles a small core of characters, and makes us care about them just enough to draw our sympathy at their plight.

The central relationship is between sheriff Olyphant and his wife, the town doctor, played by Radha Mitchell.  They are a couple that has clearly been together for awhile, and there are no big histrionics between them.  They feel like a couple that has a natural ease between each other, and even when pushed to extremes, there's never any doubt that they're comfortable.  This reflects the overall ease of the movie...it doesn't push too hard.  Olyphant and Mitchell feel more like a married couple that is comfortably at ease with each other...not the typical movie couple who always have to find a way to tear each other's clothes off and fool around, even as the world collapses around them.  I liked that...and it made me really root for them.

In many ways, the most interesting relationship is between Olyphant and his deputy, played by Joe Anderson (ACROSS THE UNIVERSE).  Their interplay, the casual deference of the deputy for his boss, their unshakeable sense of duty all feel natural.  These are good guys...but in quiet, unassuming ways.  They just do what they feel is right, even if they're really scared.  The movie is not showy about them...it's not like their Mel Gibson & Danny Glover in LETHAL WEAPON...they're just a couple of small town law enforcement officers who wear their badges not only with pride but with an instinctive understanding that they have RESPONSIBILITY as well.

The movie has scares aplenty, and lots of tense scenes.  There's a great scene in the latter half when the couple is confronted by a couple of crazies in their own bedroom...we've got four people basically clawing and scratching at each other in a tiny room, and it's maddening to watch.

It's nice to see a good, honest little film that knows its business, but takes the time to get enough little details right to make it just a bit more than ordinary.  If you're in the mood for a few jump-in-your-seat moments, you could do far, far worse than THE CRAZIES.",1267660800,105,4197,4.784722222222222

8349079,3,B0021L8UXK,"Overall, an enjoyable take on small town insanity, paranoia, and apocalyptic survival. Some flaws abound in the dramatic ending, but I like the film's ultimate pessimism. Generally well-crafted and entertaining while also a cautionary tale about the importance of a clean environment and the dangers of the military-industrial complex. Loses some of its focus when it becomes an epidemic-scope story, but recovers.",1522368000,,414,5.693548387096774
