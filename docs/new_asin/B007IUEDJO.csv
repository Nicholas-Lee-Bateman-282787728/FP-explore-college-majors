5089921,5,B007IUEDJO,As parent I would recommend to get this DVD specially for foreign parents kids will enjoy it. Mine loved it,1354665600,,107,4.4
5089922,5,B007IUEDJO,"I recommend this product if your son or daughter like music, my daughter is 2 year old and she is busy but when I need a little free time I put this video and other and she is fine, wash and help her learn more. This helps increase her knowledge.",1353456000,,246,3.94
5089923,5,B007IUEDJO,WE LOVE SUPER WHY IN OUR HOUSE. THE DVD IS PERFECT FOR WHEN IT IS NOT ON TV. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND EDUCATIONAL FOR TV.,1352937600,,119,4.0
5089924,3,B007IUEDJO,My daughter loves Super Why on TV so I decided to get the DVD for the car.  Just beware of all the ads/commercial additions.  My impatient daughter wants her show immediately and it's dangerous when I have to use the remote while driving to pass through all the ads.,1349136000,2,266,4.408163265306122
5089925,5,B007IUEDJO,"My daughter just loves super why she's 15 months its educational and I even enjoy watching it, we have all the DVDs keep them comin!",1347148800,,132,4.32
5089926,5,B007IUEDJO,"There are so many wonderful things to say about this DVD. First, you have the element of imagination as Whyatt and his friends transform from mere mortals into their super hero personas. They fly into books to look for the answers to the questions that will solve their problems. In addition, the show is interactive, with the characters addressing the audience and taking your child on the adventure with them. Your child will enjoy singing along and solving problems alongside the Super Readers, while learning important skills like identifying letters, spelling, and reading comprehension. As a writer, I love how Super Why! can change the story with his power to read. That helps kids realize the power of words.

Each episode opens with a summary of what the viewer will learn, so parents can see what will be focused on and supplement their child's learning. Extra features include fun song videos, four PC games, and coloring pages.

Super Why!: Around the World Adventure DVD is a great way to get your kids ready to read!",1344470400,14,1030,4.88
5089927,5,B007IUEDJO,"Just like the TV show, this Superwhy DVD is a quality movie and just what my son wanted.  Thank you very much!",1343520000,,110,4.0
5089928,5,B007IUEDJO,"My kids love Super Why, but this is the first time they've been introduced to the dictionary dog. The dog works into the cast of characters well and the stories incorporate his super power smoothly. Sometimes it's a bit annoying to hear the dog give a definition that isn't really a definition, just a description of what they're seeing, but of course my kids don't care. They really like hearing what new words mean and for some reason having it come from a dog makes it all the more appealing.",1342742400,,495,4.511111111111111

5089934,5,B007IUEDJO,"My 2.5 year old has a slight speech delay (previous ear problems) and this show has actually helped her with some of her missing sounds/words. I love that it breaks down sentence structure, letters and sounds. We don't have cable or even local channels where we live (100% static even with antennas) . So I kinda took a gamble. I am sooo glad we bought this DVD. We'll be buying more episodes.",1484956800,,393,4.472222222222222

5089948,5,B007IUEDJO,"My daughter loves Super Why. I love this DVD because it has the 'play all' feature unlike our 'Jack and the Beanstalk' one. I thought she just enjoyed watching it but she's truly been learning her letters from it. She's 4, nonverbal autistic, we were amazed when we asked her to pick a specific letter and she went through the entire alphabet after only watching episodes of Super Why for a week. This is why we only watch learning cartoons. I love how they highlight each letter as they say it. The puzzle is also a cute addition. She can now put it together as well. I'd definitely recommend this video.",1466294400,4,605,4.45945945945946
