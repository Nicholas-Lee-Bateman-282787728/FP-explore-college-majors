If you missed any of the episode or would like to watch the episodes over and over again (like I do) so you can catch the witty dialogue, you would get this DVD collection covering the first two seasons.  And it is well-worth getting the DVD just to be able to feel transported into that small town cozy banter anytime you feel like it rather than wait for a rerun.",1103500800,21,488,4.351648351648351

It's been a few years since I bought this, and the price has gone up, as I believe it was quite a bit cheaper to buy this set than the first two seasons separately.  This rating is for the dvds.  As others have noted, the permanent packaging should be sturdier and better quality to protect the discs.  Like nearly every dvd, the plastic wrap is a pain to remove with either no, or ineffective, ""open here"" tabs or assists.",1404518400,,567,4.413461538461538

2162947,2,B00062J12A,"I bought this as a gift for a friend to start off her GG dvd collection (and so she would stop borrowing mine all the time!)

PROS
I liked that they updated the cases. I have issues with my older cardboard cases with the adhesive coming loose and the plastic disk pages falling out.  However, these cases are slim plastic that snap shut and the dvds stay put.

CONS
Season 1 was perfect, but Season 2 was all jumbled.  All the episodes were there, but they were all out of order and on the wrong disks.
 $22+shipping was a great deal for both seasons but a little steep for just one usable season.",1383955200,,597,4.247787610619469

I was glad to find this set for a very reasonable price but you get what you pay for sometimes. The discs from season 1 featured a different design than the other 6 seasons (the box set design, rather than the characters' faces) and discs 3 and 6 from season 2 were mislabeled. Not a huge deal, but if I'm going to have the whole series then I want them to all match. I returned them and will be ordering these seasons separately.",1368662400,,609,4.350877192982456

2162963,5,B00062J12A,"I've been a long-time Gilmore Girls fan, but never thought to buy the show, until I discovered my girlfriend had never seen, or heard of, the show.  This collection is an excellent intro to the Gilmore Girls, and I recommend it highly.

Here's the set-up:  Lorelai Gilmore had her daughter Rory at the age of sixteen, out of wedlock, embarrassing her wealthy and status-conscious parents.  It's now sixteen years later, and she runs the Independence Inn, while Rory (short for Lorelai, BTW), has qualified to go to Chilton, a ritzy college preparatory private school.  Desperate to pay the tuition, Lorelai grudgingly asks her parents for the money so Rory can attend and eventually go to Harvard.  The mother asks for one thing in return: both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the parents' house every Friday.  Lorelai and Rory have had minimal contact with them over the years, so this is an unwelcome change, but one they agree to.

The clashes between Lorelai and her parents is fascinating, especially because the parents are just as complex as Lorelai and Rory, with character-driven surprises coming to view.  All of the characters change and grow in logical, organic ways, and the stories flow very well.

Another treat is the rapid-fire banter the series is rightly celebrated for.  Laden with humor and obscure references, this is the best part of this wonderful show.  There is also, in the Season Two set, a booklet of ""Gilmore-isms"" that explain some of the more arcane references from that season.  You have to listen quickly to catch them all, or watch episodes again to get some of the references.  It's reminiscent of the best of Hepburn and Tracy, and then some.

Most of the action takes place in the fictional town of Stars Hollow.  Replete with engaging characters, truly deserving of the greatly overused word ""quirky"", they add charm and comedy, as well as some drama, to the show.  Each of the characters has a story, sometimes more than one, but many of them will remind you of people you know or have known.  The saying, ""All of us are stars in our own lives, and bit players in the lives of everyone else,"" has special meaning here.  All of the residents of Stars Hollow have their own stories, their own concerns and worries, some of which may seem trivial, but aren't played that way.  Stars Hollow doesn't exist in the real world, but I'd move there in an instant if it did.

For all that it touches on serious matters, Gilmore Girls does so with an underlying sense of humor, but without making light of anything the characters experience.  Okay, not *too* light, but the humor and poignancy, as well as the real relationships with their ups and downs, are very enjoyable to watch.

Since my girlfriend's introduction to Gilmore Girls, she can't wait to see more, and agrees it's very well written, and a joy to watch.  She's told her mother, sister and others about it, and now they can't wait to borrow this set to see what all the hullabaloo is about.

I highly recommend Gilmore Girls to anyone with a heart, sense of humor, or love of good entertainment.",1366502400,,3096,4.720670391061453

The packaging needs improvement.  It's thin, and one of my cases has already broken.  I was hoping for a quality case so my new disc's don't get messed up but I guess I'll have to go buy those myself.
The outside cover is beautiful.  It comes in a box, which is a decent sized thickness, and the insert booklet is beautifully done.  Then you get to the rather thin plastic, which flips on hinges to reveal the 6 discs.  The hinge is the biggest problem, because your sleeves come out of it.  The dvd's themselves are wonderful, not a problem with any of them -- and yes, I checked every single disc before I would review.
So, excellent show, great dvd's, needs new packaging.",1307404800,13,872,4.2682926829268295

The packaging is comprised of an outer paper sleeve, inner transparent plastic case, booklet and discs. The booklet details a summary of each episode  with pictures to reference.

2162986,5,B00062J12A,"This is my all-time favorite TV show! Every episode makes for riveting viewing, and the great casting makes all the difference...the drama centers around the life and exploits of single mother Lorelai Gilmore [the amazing Lauren Graham] who raises her only child Rory [stunning Alexis Bledel]in the idyllic town of Stars Hollow, somewhere in Connecticut. It's an amazing drama...every episode here in Season One makes you really come to know and love the characters, both main and secondary. We come to care about what happens to Lorelai & Rory...in Season One, 16 year old Rory gets accepted into the prestigious private school Chilton, and Lorelai has to grapple with the problem of how to finance it, and out of desperation approaches her estranged parents for help. The chemistry between the two leads as mother and daughter is electrifying and altogether credible. Lorelai's parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore are portrayed as stuffy, upper-class people who use money as the means to keep tabs on their daughter and granddaughter. Of course, the stories go deeper than that, and the characters themselves develop in greater depth as the series goes on...but herein lies the charm in Gilmore Girls...the dialogue, witty repartee and stellar acting from all characters make this a show that grows from strength to strength and makes an addict of the viewer.

The residents of Stars Hollow are an eccentric bunch indeed - be it Luke of Luke's Diner, Ms Patty the dance teacher, Taylor the town councilman, Michel the crabby concierge, Sookie St James the irreverent cook and BFF of Lorelai, Lane Kim as Rory's sidekick - we come to love each of these characters for their role in the series.

Season Two sees us revisiting Stars Hollow, the idyllic little Connecticut town that is home to Lorelai Gilmore and her teenage daughter Rory. There are some interesting plot developments in this season - Lorelai gets engaged to Max and faces some dilemmas and inner conflict, Rory's stable relationship with Dean, her long-term boyfriend is threatened by the arrival of Jess, a rebellious teenager from NY who also happens to be Luke's nephew, and of course, the turbulent relationship that Lorelai has with her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore goes through more upheaval. Meanwhile, Luke gets into some romantic entanglements of his own.

There are other interesting developments in this season that make GG an addictive must-watch - Rory's rivalry with Paris Geller, Richard's forced retirement and its aftermath, Christopher's re-entry into the Gilmore girls' lives and many more. The eccentric townspeople of Stars Hollow add to the appeal of the show, Taylor Doose's 'dictatorship' of the town goes to new heights, Kirk's manic antics and many more. Coupled with rapid fire witty dialogue that has become the trademark of the show, Gilmore Girls is a rare gem indeed- great casting, engaging storylines and well-developed characters. A must-watch indeed!",1302739200,,2957,5.16910229645094
2162987,5,B00062J12A,"I was fortunate enough to catch the rare re-run on television, and the Gilmore Girls looked like a show that would be good for me and my daughter to enjoy together. I was completely surprised when my 13 year old son seemed to enjoy the show even more than my daughter. I think this show has a little bit of everything for everyone. I'm not ashamed to admit that mostly it was the tight relationship between mother and daughter and the continuous stream of sarcastic remarks that won me over completely in the end. And of course lets not forget the blast from the past music. Hope you enjoy them as much as I did.",1298505600,,612,4.3304347826086955

2162989,3,B00062J12A,"The first season of Gilmore Girls promised to be one of the best sitcoms since The Mary Tyler Moore Show. The dialog was witty and consistently good. The characters were quirky, but real. Each of the characters is a flawed, but decent human being (except for Rory who is the perfect young teenager, a serious flaw in reality). The story unfolds showing the strengths and weaknesses of each character in a series of warm, amusing episodes.

The quality of the series, however, descended dramatically in Season Two and essentially became a soap opera with dark overtones. Lorelai's mother changes from a manipulative but caring mother who is concerned for the welfare of her grandchild (from her cloistered perspective) to an extremely, self-centered woman whose primary concern is her control over her granddaughter and in the process sabotages her granddaughter's inheritance. Our hero, Lorelai, also develops an unusually cruel streak. She is so thrilled with her mother's discomfort with her mother-in-law (her mother's mother-in-law) that she brings a camera to photograph the event. A key episode is the one in which Lorelai breaks off her engagement at the last minute without the decency to explain why to her fiance, but rather lets the town gossip break the news to all and sundry. Are men simply objects without feelings in women's soap operas, whose sole purpose is to adore the heroine and disappear when not needed? Escapism is one thing, but escapism that breeds gross insensitivity to others is not something to expect of the heroes with whom we identify.

In the first season, when Lorelei was a decent person despite her flaws, her father lectured her on the pain she had caused others by having a child out of wedlock. Lorelai, however, values her independence so much that she opts out of marriage with the father of her child although she loves him (in her self-centered sort of way) and sleeps with him in a later episode. It is interesting to note that of the many characters in the story there is no happily married couple with children. Is this because it might expose the fans of the Gilmore Girls to the happiness that Lorelai and Rory might have experienced growing up with a decent father figure (believe it or not, a key component of the majority of families). It is also interesting to note that in the first season, Rory's boyfriend breaks up with her because of her lack of spontaneous warmth to his declaration of love and she is then bereft and much saddened until they make up several episodes later. Episodes such as these have the element of truth in them. In contrast, in the second season, she puts off a date with her boyfriend because she is busy and promises to meet with him that evening. She later fluffs him off for a very self-centered reason. This time, however, reality gives way to escapism and the boyfriend crawls back with an apology. It doesn't happen that way in reality, at least with young men having some backbone. I gave the soap opera a rating of three stars, this being the average of five stars for the first season and one star for the second season.

The sad part of all of this is that Rory and Lorelai have a huge fan base. There are hundreds of thousands of young women who identify with our two self-centered heroes regardless of their insensitivity (if not downright cruelty) to others and their lack of responsibility regarding their actions. Witty banter does make up for irresponsible behavior. If Lorelai and Rory are role models for today's young American women, I suggest that young American men of substance look offshore for more deserving women.",1243036800,,3621,4.818327974276527

It is nice to get lost in a world that that isn't filled with violence and crime and there is still an emphasis on friends and community.  Very positive and uplifting.  I wish this was still a series.  I AM HOOKED!,1224892800,,374,4.3478260869565215

2162994,5,B00062J12A,This series is a sweet oasis of edgy wit and politically incorrect characters who surround Loreli and Rory Gilmore in Stars Hollow. The fact that Miss Patti smokes as she issues vague directions to small ballerinas and Kirk's short film is a dark homage to Eraserhead only serves to remind fans of the GGs that it's ok for adults to watch these begining years of a seven year run. Lots of thumbs up!,1202860800,,399,4.47945205479452

2162996,5,B00062J12A,"Best DVD investment I have ever made!

Watching these shows from the beginning of the series took me back to when I first discovered this witty fast-moving show. Now I can get the rest of my family hooked too!",1153872000,2,209,4.358974358974359
2162997,5,B00062J12A,"The quick, witty dialogue of Gilmore Girls is an homage to screwball comedy films like His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby.  It works surprising well, largely because there are different levels of speed talking: Some characters can keep up, others get lost, and some try on certain days and prefer to be normal people on other days.  References and allusions abound as well.  Some of the cultural references are highly obscure - that is, even with your ability to pause and rewind the world of Gilmore Girls, there are times when even the viewer can't keep up.  This is all part of the fun of a dialogue-driven comedy that serves its main characters far too much coffee and a hilarious amount of food.

When the plot turns serious and the dialogue slows down, the sparkling planned community shimmers away as the stuff of real life creates drama.  I appreciate that the writers understand the need to feel drama slowly.  You can't banter through it, because only happy people relish in clever games.

It's hard to explain how a show about mostly white, middle class people living in a crime-free fantasy has become so popular, especially on the WB, which has been one of the few channels to embrace all of America's cultures, races, classes, and so on.  I think the answer is that the relationship between a single mother and her daughter and an absentee father is highly translatable to many Americans.  There are many conversations detailing Lorelai's struggles to provide for her daughter.  Viewers also empathize with the weird and uncomfortable encounters with rich, elitist people, namely, Lorelai's parents.

The DVDs are somewhat lacking in extras - a making-of video and some extended or extra scenes are all you get.  I think fans of the show would enjoy a dialogue dictionary of all of the references the characters make, a list of the books Rory and Jess are always reading, a map of Stars Hollow, a coffee cup, and Sookie's recipes.",1141430400,,1946,4.807807807807808
2162998,5,B00062J12A,"Great show for teens and adults, especially for moms and daughters to watch together.  Good way to catch up on the first two seasons, if you missed them.  The show's writers have to get credit for the wit and humor and one-liners.  Nice to have something decent when there is nothing to watch on TV.",1126396800,,299,4.4

The mom slept with the daughter's Dad, then her fiance, Digger, and now Luke in all the years that it has been on television.  The mom does not have a different guy each week!!!

I have never laughed so much at a TV show except for maybe The Golden Girls.

8037474,2,B00062J12A,"I bought this set for my wife who likes this show. I remember seeing little bits of it on the TV years ago just channel-flipping but never grabbed me. So I sat down and watched the first seasons of Gilmore Girls. Overall I just didn't care for the show...

*Music wise it's something else altogether. For some reason it seems like a modification on the Golden Girls theme. The music throughout the show of a girl strumming an acoustic guitar and going la-la-la was very dry and lifeless. Coffee house crap music you hear that has no talent or effort applied. Someone was paid to go la-la-la in a whiney fashion and strum a guitar...seriously?

*The show isn't so dry that there aren't moments that can't make you laugh...it's their personalities. Alexis Bledell's character(Rory) is a spoiled child with a whiney draw to her voice and complaining constantly about her materialistic needs. Obviously someone who never got a solid dose of reality and the taste of life as working class. Lauren Graham's character(Lorelai) is a mom who behaves more like a sister. She can be funny at times but also someone you've encountered in public before as an annoying individual. The kind of person who sees what book you're reading,they sit down beside you and tell you the story of the book. They'll probably make some random outbursts about your taste in clothing positive or negative. Or probably go on and on about something stupid like how much one of your shoelaces touching the ground bothers them and develop a mindless story out of it. Everyone in this show just seems so frantic and jumpy on top of their high and mighty behavior. Hate to say it but it taps into the behavior patterns of Northerners who are used to talking to people like crap.

If you want a good sitcom watch Mama's Family or Golden Girls...plenty of better shows that were on TV over this!",1424131200,,1857,4.690184049079755

It's easy to figure out the order of the discs as soon as you watch all of them.  If you have never seen the whole show before then the mislabelled discs will be a bit confusing because you won't be watching the show in sequence.  However, even though two discs were mislabelled, the discs play fine and this show is definitely worth purchasing.",1411776000,,516,4.4
