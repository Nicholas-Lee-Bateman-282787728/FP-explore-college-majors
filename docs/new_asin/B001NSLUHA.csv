8327889,2,B001NSLUHA,"When studying sexuality became a goal of 19th-century scientists, they focused on what didn't work, or what they considered deviant, rather than what was deemed normal.  Luckily, Masters & Johnsons research changed things in the 20th century.  Well, this doc on teenage brains focused on two issues: schizophrenia and addiction.  These are important things to discuss.  However, why do ""normal"" teen brains act the way they do?  How do normal brains in teens differ from little children and adults?  I loved that the doc had diverse interviewees: boys and girls, whites and people of color, even a transracial adoptee and her parents.  I also think that many viewers will enjoy that the program ends on a upbeat note.  Still, I would have liked to hear more about what works, rather than what fails.",1406678400,2,799,4.954887218045113
