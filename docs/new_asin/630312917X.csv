Crates or cages are being unloaded from a ship. Tigers, lions, zebras, and leopards are unloaded. One cage breaks to free a tiger, but a man recaptures it! A young woman was placed in a sanatorium. Dr. Walters meets the sisters. Dorothy has been losing weight and was sent there. Elsewhere circus animals are kept in their winter quarters (warm Florida). The lions and tigers are caged, then fed. There is a problem with Chela the gorilla, she is very smart. Dr. Walters checks his test laboratory animals. Does he want to experiment on people? Dr. Walters conspires to steal that gorilla, the handler is disposed of.

Dr. Walters operates on a patient. Will she be alright? The trainer tames a tiger. Nothing to it. Dr. Walters sees a change. Nurse Strand objects, Dr. Walters overrules her; the experiment continues. Dr. Walters unwraps his test subject, Paula Dupree. She will be under his control. [The dream of most men?] At the circus Fred wants to do the animal act (lions and tigers). Dr. Walters visits the circus with Paula Dupree. The lion and tiger fight, Fred is knocked down. Paula intervenes to save him. The manager doesnt want to hire Paula for the show, but Fred convinces him. The show goes on. Lions and tigers are made to perform. Amazing?

A tiger rolls over on command. The show is a hit. But Paula is jealous of Freds girlfriend. Alone in a dressing room there is a transformation, then a threat. A weird creature attacks a woman and kills her! Dr. Walters must renew his operation on Paula. Fred must continue the act without Paula. Dorothy wants to leave the sanitarium, she is afraid of the treatments. The storm breaks, Chela leaves her cage to attack Dr. Walters. The wind causes the tent to partially collapse, people run in a panic. Fred loses control and is attacked by a lion. Chela arrives to save Fred. But a policeman shoots Chela. The show ends. The moral is to not meddle with nature.

Meddling with nature has produced longer and better lives for most people (vaccinations, etc.). This story is a variation on the Wolfman series, where someone changes into an animal. You could compare it to Pygmalion where a drab woman is changed into a beautiful lady. The man who does wrong finds his punishment. Some of the scenes were taken from an earlier Clyde Beatty movie, Fred Mason resembled him.[ Scenes were reused whenever possible as an economy measure during wartime, so too darker lighting.] It is about average and worth watching once. The idea of a human changing into a powerful animal has symbolism. You could compare it to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Are tigers really found in Africa? Or is it Asia?",1469923200,,2673,4.6929637526652455

Beth is hoping that Walters can cure her sister's issues. Alas, Dr. Walters has plans for Dorothy that are inhuman... literally!  After seeing a caged, female go-rilla (aka: a huge guy in a go-rilla suit) at the local circus, Walters decides to use Dorothy's glands to create a human / ape hybrid! So, he hires a thug, grabs the go-rilla, and we're off to the lab! Much ""scientific"" ballyhoo ensues. Enter the ever-lovely Acquanetta (JUNGLE WOMAN) as Paula Dupree, the CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN. Big trouble begins, when Paula falls for Beth's boyfriend! Horror and death commence! CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN is the perrrfect piece of fuzzy cheeeze! For her part, Acquanetta is beguiling and beee-u-t-ful! Animal cruelty alert- Let's just say that back in the '40's, they -apparently- didn't give a damn about animals.

7839213,3,630312917X,"Dr. Walters {John Carradine} has made great strides in his field of glandular transplants. But as his work progresses, the more unhinged his approach to his science becomes. Stealing a tame gorilla from the local circus, Walters transforms the gorilla into a beautiful woman whom he names Paula Dupree {Acquanetta}. Upon taking Paula to the circus it's found that she has hypnotic powers over the lions and tigers and is promptly made part of the taming of the beasts act. But can Paula contain her true animal instincts? Sounds bonkers doesn't it? Well it is, but it's not the plot that makes the film so distinctly average. This is after all a low level Universal Pictures movie, we want, in fact demand, bizarre plots and berserker horror episodes. The problems exist with the complete lack of tension in the script, for a film that has a running time of just over an hour, you would think the big ""transplant"" and creation of ""wild woman"" would come sooner rather than later. But it doesn't, what we get is 45 minutes of musing about science and continual takes of circus animal training. With the latter containing some truly awful editing. Paula puts in an appearance late in the piece, then bang! it's pretty much the end and one can't help be disappointed after having stayed with it thus far. Carradine hams it up and enjoys himself one feels, while Evelyn Ankers gives the other performance of note as Beth Colman. The film also serves as an interesting point of reference in the career of director Edward Dmytryk, who in the following few years would deliver some classics in a number of genres. He deserved better material here, hell they all did. But as ever with most of Universal's horror pictures, you end up taking the rough with the smooth and still enjoy yourself. A watchable yet frustrating experience it be. 5/10",1299801600,3,1834,4.752351097178684

The beautiful Acquanetta plays Paula Dupree the ape woman in the first two films of the series. The lovely Acquanetta wasn't in the last movie of the trilogy, but we did get Rondo Hatton in that one so that was a treat! I love all these ape woman movies!",1092787200,7,345,4.40625
7839216,3,630312917X,"A curious attempt to combine a horror movie and a circus adventure flick.  A sinister doctor (John Carradine) surgically transforms a female gorilla into a mysterious woman named Paula Dupree (Acquanetta).  She is attracted to animal trainer Fred Mason (Milburn Stone).  Due to plot developments beyond our control, the surgery wears off and Paula undergoes an ""ape-woman"" transformation that is typical of the trademark horror movies of Universal Studio.
This film is both too much and too little.  The running time is only 61 minutes.  The scriptwriters made a noble effort to combine diverse plot elements within the time constraints, but the results are mixed.  The convoluted plot goes off in different directions that don't always make sense.  There seems to be an inordinate amount of time showing Clyde Beatty doubling for Fred as he whips the ferocious big cats into shape.  Paula's emotions eventually trigger a response that tips her delicate glandular balance over the edge.  Her devolution back to a gorilla is gradual and she initially changes into a murderous ape-woman creature, enhanced by Jack Pierce's makeup.  This quasi-werewolf is the best part of this little movie, but the screen time given to this aspect of the story is too little.  Perhaps one metamorphosis scene was all the budget could sustain.  This reviewer was left wishing for more horror movie elements and less of the ""let's train the big cats"" segments.  The climax of the movie is rushed and abrupt, as if the director was conscious of the clock ticking.  The final fade-out pontificating on the danger of not reckoning on God is disjointed from the rest of the action.
This movie is described elsewhere as ""camp"" entertainment.  Well, perhaps.  As a modest budgeted suspense flick, it's okay, but it could be better.  In the hierarchy of Universal's classic horror films, this one is in the minor leagues.  To insure compliance with our ""oath of office,"" dedicated collectors of classic horror films need this movie to complete one's video library.  Other viewers should adjust their expectations accordingly.  ;-)",969580800,9,2103,5.129411764705883
