8082180,2,B000B66GTM,"Sub-par black-and-white Spanish-language, Mexican-Cuban-made El Santo film.  I've seen a lot of El Santo movies and this one is BORRRIIING.  El Santo is in the movie only slightly, at most three scenes.  It is more about some spy fumbling about in a languid fashion, like a man on vacation.  The only two good things about this film is the locales and the music.  It was filmed on location in pre-Castro Cuba, and it has some nice musical numbers.  Only for El Santo completists.",1397088000,,479,4.710843373493976
8082181,5,B000B66GTM,"Again, Santo strikes. Also filmed in Cuba. A rare and very interesting campy movie. You can see the Havana of fifties. An arqueological piece. Must see!",1363910400,,152,4.884615384615385
8082182,3,B000B66GTM,"I was really looking forward to viewing this item when it arrived. And it looks like a fun movie, and the video quality is great! But, once AGAIN (just like another item I recently purchased through Amazon)! despite Amazon's assertion that this item DOES feature English subtitles... it DOESN'T. It would be nice if Amazon exerted some measure of quality control regarding the product details. If buyers can't trust the product descriptions, then why buy?
UPDATE 1/27/14:
Nearly TWO YEARS LATER and the product details STILL list that this item includes ENGLISH SUBTITLES when it DOESN'T! This film has NEVER been released (on VHS, Laserdisc, VCD, DVD, Streaming, or in any other form) with English Subtitles!
Three words, Amazon: TRUTH IN ADVERTISING!",1335571200,7,752,5.172131147540983
8082183,5,B000B66GTM,"A great jewel,it's Santo and also one of his first films ever. Done in Cuba before the Castro regimen when it was not as complicated for a foreign film company to work there, it shows action and why not ? Nostalgia.",1305244800,,215,4.2682926829268295
