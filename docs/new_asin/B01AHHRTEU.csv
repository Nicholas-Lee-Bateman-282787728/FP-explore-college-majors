7600949,4,B01AHHRTEU,"I remember this Western from my childhood. I don't recall any morally quesionable content at all, yet it was quite captivating.
The show tells the story of a man wrongfully accused of a crime. He escapes into the untamed wilderness and is befriended by a  mountain man (Uncle Jessey from ""The Dukes.."") called FlapJack, an American Indian, and a grizzly bear.
I don't think that it ran for more than a season or two at the most. I do remember a two part episode or tv movie at the end of it's run that tied up the story in a ""happy ever after"" bow.

We are picky about what types of entertainment we show our young family, and this fits the bill for everyone. I'm looking forward to it's arrival on DVD.
Hope this review helped if you've never heard of the show.",1217376000,23,762,4.321678321678322
7600950,5,B01AHHRTEU,"The previous two reviews do a great job of summarizing the plot but what I want to emphasize is that this is one film that should be re-released on DVD NOW! It is a fantastic family film - along the lines of ""Charlie the Lonesome Cougar"" (Disney) in it's appeal and genre. Words just can't do this film justice - it's done in a style that Hollywierd has long left behind AND you can leave the room not worrying that someone's head is going to explode from the language or other content.

A good, wholesome, family oriented film that's very safe for your entire family.",1184284800,,568,4.40952380952381
7600951,4,B01AHHRTEU,"This movie is based upon the true story of James ""Grizzly"" Adams (Dan Haggerty), an unfairly accused man who chooses to live exiled in the wilderness above standing trial for a crime he did not commit. Along the way, he befriends a big, big bear named Ben, and a trapper and his mule. In the TV series (1977-78), Ben was played by a female Grizzly named Bozo.

Three sequels followed, with only one starring Haggerty in the title role: The Capture of Grizzly Adams (1982); The Legend of Grizzly Adams (1990); and Grizzly Adams and the Legend of Dark Mountain (1999).

As is usually the case, the first is the best. Haggerty and the bear create magic onscreen, and the locations are lovely.

7600952,5,B01AHHRTEU,"A Sun Classics Picture. (Sun International Productions Release)
  This story is based upon an actual man who we know today as ""Grizzly Adams"".  He lived from 1812-1860 and is now considered a legend.
  James Adams (Dan Haggerty) is wrongfully accused of a crime that happened near his home. He is innocent.  He has lost all hope and decides there is nothing else to do but leave his wife and eight-year old daughter (Lisa Jones) forever for a life in the wilderness.  All that he had of his daughter's was a red ribbon from her hair to take with him.
  In the wilderness he becomes fast friends to the animals around him.  He shared his lunch with a deer.  He finds a young bear stranded on a ledge.  James saves him and decides to raise him.  He calls him ""Ben"". ( You are remembering ""Gentle Ben"" with Clint Howard now)  He helps a fallen Indian man (Don Shanks) who has a broken leg.  James makes splints and helps the Indian to heel with water and fresh meat. The Indian taught James some survival skills.  After the Indian was healed, the Indian makes James a blood brother.
  The Indian checks on James from time to time, but the wilderness has it's challenges for James.
  Rated ""G"".  Some scenes may need parental guidence for children.  The movie is suitable for children and the whole family and may help children respect nature.
  Marjorie Harper is also in the cast.
  Followed by a tv series, ""The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams"" (1977-78).  Dan Haggerty and Don Shanks continue their original roles.
  The story continues again with ""The Capture of Grizzly Adams (1982-TVM), when Adams sees his daughter again.
  Then followed by: The Mark of the Bear (1991)
  Grizzly Mountain (1997)

7600962,4,B01AHHRTEU,"A great show from 1976-1977. I watched this as a child when it was new and it brings back lots of good memories. The scenery is beautiful and the stories are simple, yet heart-warming, with moral lessons that aren't shoved down viewers' throats. Much better than the sexually perverted and politically-correct garbage TV shows and movies these days. Hollywood has truly lost its way since then.

Picture and sound quality are below average, but it's still watchable. Would have been nice if they had included subtitles, but for the price, it's hard to complain.

The only main drawback of the show is the environmentalist slant that became more and more prevelanr in late episodes. Adams never cut down live trees. He stopped eating fish and only ate roots, berries, and pancakes (give me a break). All wild animals were friendly and got along with humans and each other. All of this is highly unrealistic and gives a false impression of mountain wilderness living. Even Dan Haggerty admitted in a later interview that he wished his character could have eaten regular food (meat). Minus one star.

Anyway, it's great show from a simpler time for both children and adults.",1526515200,,1171,4.904040404040404

7600988,5,B01AHHRTEU,"I love this series. I am grateful to this company for doing these. They tell you right off that these are so old that the visual ability will be at times not the best or sound. However, I feel these are pretty dang good for the money and for how old they are and what they had to work with.  This series is a family show.  Little kids can safely watch these. Few things in them are scary or so much so a child could not watch this. There isn't swearing or inappropriateness in them. These are very Christian in values without preaching really.  Mainly, they are about loving nature, being kind to animals, respecting mother earth, knowing what we do to our water and earth comes back to us in our toxic food or land or the death of fish etc. and being kind and forgiving with others around us and remaining non-judgmental of others until we know the facts and unconditional love for those of other cultures, smell, IQ or differentness. The Christmas one is beautiful at the end of the series about the birth of Jesus Christ. The pace of these is low key and slow and relaxing. We love these in our family and the stories are sweet and decent.  Enjoy these and keep these for a family treasure.  But remind your kids, these are trained animals and never be so trusting of wild things as grizzly Adams was.",1510012800,5,1304,4.349794238683128

7601008,3,B01AHHRTEU,"Grew up on this show and loved it. Apparently I still do because despite the sub-par transfer, I still watch it though with a bit of irritation.  In a day when TV is full of agendas, material not appreciated in our private living room, and supposed reality shows, collecting and watching these old TV shows is a blast from the past.  This, however, is not a review of the TV series. That deserves no less than 5 Stars.

The transfer quality is pretty dismal. Apparently, very little restoration was actually done on the master. Color is washed out, production anomalies are ever-present.  It seems CBS feels the disclaimer at the beginning of the Season 1 Disks was enough to get them off the hook. It just seems to me that a little care should be taken when producing and distributing these old TV shows. If you are going to do something, DO IT RIGHT! It is very disappointing that so many old shows, like Emergency!, Battlestar Galactica, & The Six Million Dollar Man are redistributed on DVD with little to no restoration work done on the master.  Im not asking for Blu-Ray quality, just clean up the anomalies, true the color and audio. In many spots, the audio is warbly and flat.  Sometimes its downright hollow and muffled.

The Season 2 discs seem to look better than Season 1. However, part of me suspects the master was in better condition to begin with.  There were still a large number of production anomalies and flat audio.

Disc 8 has an odd ring at the beginning of each segment, during scene access or skipping.

I do appreciate the fact that they didn't spindle the discs. Page flippers are much better on the discs and makes easier access to a specific set of episodes. This was the saving grace from 1 star. I will rate this 3 stars based on the a/v quality as follows:
5 Stars  The show itself.
-3 Stars  A/V quality
+1 Star  Packaging

I believe the 5  star overall rating for this set is misleading. While Grizzly Adams is no doubt a favorite classic, technically, the picture and audio quality fall short of expectations.

NOTE:  ""The Renewal""  & ""Once Upon a Starry Night"" ARE included in this set, so don't make the mistake I almost did and buy them.",1498089600,23,2176,4.535897435897436

7601025,4,B01AHHRTEU,"If you like a bargain and grizzly Adams then this is the set to buy. This set has both seasons for about .50 currently less than season one. Not sure why but a bargain.

Grizzly Adams is a great show that came out back in my childhood. Back then nature and pioneer type movies were in like wilderness family and Seven Alone. If you like those you would like this.

He has a few friends but keeps to himself. One main supporting characters is a big grizzly bear. Another is the actor that played uncle Jessie on the dukes of Hazard.

Outfits appear about the time period of the late 1800's or when wagon trains were in effect as one early story involved them. This series came out about the same time as little house. A big difference between the two is little house was family centered.

The actor who played grizzly Adams was very good. I believe he was a environmentalist who passed not to long ago. Much tension in the show is created as he is wanted for a crime he didn't commit but he is willing to stick his neck out for a friend or s stranger.

Well made case and good clean family fun.",1490486400,7,1093,4.235576923076923

7601042,5,B01AHHRTEU,"The delightful story of a soft spoken man who was accused of a murder he did not commit (although nobody actually bothered to come to his house to arrest him) who ran away to the wilderness abandoning his 12 year old daughter to fend for herself with no viable source of income during a period of the great western frontiersmen when women were not permitted to work for money unless they were willing to sully themselves in a house of ill repute. This film is not that story however and focuses instead on the fleeing father who rescues a bear cub off a cliff and realises he has a ... thing for animals, a gentle loving touch.
Despite not knowing how to survive in the wilderness and refusing to eat all of natures kindly little critters that come up to him he manages to build a log cabin along a river and is promptly found in the very first episode by a lone, muscular, half naked Native American who in spite of being unable to speak English immediately befriends the accused murderer and starts to constantly hang around and sleeping over at night in spite of there being only one bed in the cabin.
Within a few days, a dirty old man shows up and befriends the two men along with his mule, number 7.
The three men have many wild and crazy adventures out there in that cabin in the woods all alone and everyone is happy.",1483056000,5,1325,4.346774193548387

7601071,4,B01AHHRTEU,"I am a huge Grizzly Adams fan, but I had never seen the original movie until now. I must say that I was a little disappointed to find out that Dan Haggerty's voice is never hear throughout the entire move. The whole movie is narrated by someone else...even when Haggerty speaks it's dubbed over with this other voice. It's not a huge deal, but it was very distracting to hear another voice when watching him.  Anyway, the movie touches on why he ran off into the mountains, but never goes into any detail.... and of course how he found Ben. It also shows he had a daughter, something never touched on in the series until the made-for-TV-movie The Capture Of Grizzly Adams. In the original movie, Nacoma is the one who ended up bringing Adams' daughter to him. It looks to me that the episode in the original series where Adams first meets Nacoma was shot scene for scene and almost shot for shot as it was in the original movie. I will have to watch them again in succession to really compare. All in all I'm glad to have this movie in my Grizzly Adams collection.",1399161600,2,1064,4.401015228426396

I watched it with my family till I moved away from home, and I continued watching it till the second season ran out. It helped keep my life at an even keel while I went through so many life changes. I love this show so much, and its messages have had a profound influence on my life since then. The 39 stories are for anyone of any age. Please, Amazon, bring it to us on DVD!

It made my heart sing every week -- I always had supper cooking with a cracking wood fire in the first house I ever lived in back in Michigan.  It made me feel like I was already living out West in the mountains, giving up the busy world, having peace and quiet, greeting the animals, the woods, and the sky.

Like many people, I got desperate and tried ordering from one of those bootleg DVD companies.  What they sent is basically unwatchable.

No Mad Jack in this either.  Sorta like a documentary.
