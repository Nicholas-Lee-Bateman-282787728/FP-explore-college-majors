8101176,3,B000CRR2RA,"I had my expectations set very high for the third series. I thought it would be action packed like the first and second series, but the action that took place in gunlock was very very corny and a whack ass ending along with easy defeat of the bad guys. Hardly anyone was seriously hurt of the sanzo party. Unrealistic and pathetic! I wish the series was only worth 10 bucks because it was a big dissapointed and 100 minutes of my life was wasted that i will never get back.",1385164800,,473,4.266666666666667
8101177,5,B000CRR2RA,"I brought this series a while ago, in a different type of packaging....but I loved it just this same. I think people didn't like Reload and Reload Gunlock as much because of the original English voice actors didn't continue their roles. It's like one comment said before about this series....you got to give them a chance.

I say think about this way...New character designs, New continue plots, New English voice actors...BUT THE SAME GOOD OLD SAIYUKI!!!!!!. If you are a true fan of Saiyuki ...you will want it in your collection!!!",1364342400,,534,4.868131868131868
8101178,5,B000CRR2RA,Saiyuki has the very best story plot and very funny lines. I think it is one of the best animes made. I rate this anime 5 stars.,1269734400,,128,3.7777777777777777
8101179,4,B000CRR2RA,"That must've been the pitch the writers made to the producers: It's a comedy. Dirty Harry and the Three Stooges as the modern day revision of the classic Journey to the West. It'll be funny!

And it is!",1212796800,,202,4.315789473684211
8101180,4,B000CRR2RA,"Saiyuki Reload Gunlock is the third series installment in the adventures of Sanzo, Goku, Gojyo, and Hakkai: four travelers on their way to India to prevent a demon resurrection. The first Saiyuki series was by far the best so far, with awesome character development and intriguing storylines. The sequel, Saiyuki Reload, paled in comparism for the most part, although it did a fairly good adaptation of the end of the manga toward the end. So far Gunlock appears to be a step up from Reload, but still not as good as the first series.

The English voices are the same as Reload, and the art is very similar if not the same as Reload, as well. (Which is a shame, since the original character designs were more appealing to me.) The first episode is a filler, though, it's not a complete recap/reintroduction episode. The remaining episodes follow the story arc from the Saiyuki Reload manga volume 2. It's a faithful adaptation, although, I still feel like some of the characterizations are slightly off. It's an exciting storyline, so it's enjoyable to watch.

Overall, this series is already starting out better than Reload. Hopefully the rest of the series will continue in this vein. For anyone but the most hardcore fan, don't bother with Reload. (Though, DVDs 5-7 were pretty good.) Although Kougaiji's situation from Reload trails into Gunlock, if you keep up with the manga, you should know what's going on. Instead, just start up with Gunlock.",1150848000,7,1451,4.870445344129554
8101181,5,B000CRR2RA,"The series starts off as Sanzo and party are still traveling to India. However, new obstacles are standing in their way... like a new enemy... and an old one. Still, the past haunt our 4 travelers as they journey west.

There are FUNNY and very dramatic moments in the first volume of Gunlock. I have to say it is the best disc of the start of a season I have ever experienced. I can't wait to see where the rest of the series leads Sanzo and the others... and if they will EVER get to India.",1147824000,3,492,4.125
