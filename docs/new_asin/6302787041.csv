511200,5,6302787041,"I have waited a long, long time for this movie to be released on DVD as I remember seeing it a many, many years ago - only once - and I have always wanted to see it again.  I thought Amazon would let me know when it was released as I had asked to be advised but unfortunately they did not.  I found it on another site and then checked Amazon to see if they had it at last.  Even though it was a sad movie I did enjoy it very much.  It was disappointing that they did not have any reference to the older son and what had happened to him.  They rarely make movies of this calibre today - brilliant acting and an engrossing story.  Greer Garson & Walter Pidgeon acted in many truly memorable movies together but the Miniver ones have always been my favourite.",1340150400,9,756,4.074324324324325
511201,3,6302787041,"I watched this movie directly after seeing ""Mrs. Miniver"" on Turner Classics, and expected something along the same lines, however I was a bit disappointed in the defeatest tone of the movie, and the fact that there was no accounting (unless I missed it somehow) of the absence of the oldest son Vin...also, Judy aged quite fast in this sequel! I was unhappy about the ending, and couldn't understand why we couldn't just have Greer and Walter dance off into the sunset...still, if/when it is available on DVD I will buy it.",1218672000,14,524,4.706521739130435
511202,2,6302787041,"I have to admit that I was not prepared for what this film was to be about: Post-WWII Britain and the harsh realities of piecing life back together after years of andrenalin-pumped chaos and drama. I think I was  expecting this film to be lighter and more of an MGM ""production""  than what it turned out to be. In retrospect, I realize now that the best  aspect of ""The Miniver Story"" is that MGM did not overglamourize  Postwar England the way it glamourized WWII England in ""Mrs.  Miniver."" Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon are still wonderful here as  the genteel middle-class couple whose love can conquer all, including her  can't-win battle with cancer. One could easily imagine the timeless  ""coming to terms with terminal cancer"" scenes between husband and  wife transposed into any modern-day story of partners dealing with  incurable and/or degenerating diseases/conditions (AIDS, Alzheimer's,  Parkinson's, leukemia, etc.). The strength of character and bravery (along  with great acting and solid MGM production values) are the only  similarities to ""Mrs. Miniver"" you'll read in ""The Miniver  Story.""",943660800,57,1112,5.244318181818182

511409,2,6302787041,"OK, but nothing special.  Not a movie I'd likely watch repeatedly.  It ain't no ""Mrs. Miniver"".  The worst of its attributes is the terrible image quality.  Surely the high-priced talent at Warner could've done a better job of transferring from analog to digital.  Hell, I've got movies on DVD made in the '30s that look better than this.  It should be priced at six bucks.  I'll be somewhat circumspect about buying any more Warner Archive Collection DVD-Rs.

As a corollary to my comments herein, I gotta say that I have yet to download a single movie from any of the ""grey area"" BitTorrent-like websites, unlike some of my friends.  Shoddy products like this make me wonder if I should jump on that bandwagon.  I mean, I don't mind spending good money on good products, but this crap?  C'mon, Warner, get yer faeces together & deliver high quality product if you expect to retain paying customers.  Either that or start discounting these old chestnuts.  As it stands now you're not giving your customers much incentive to continue buying these movies.  I despair.",1440201600,3,1066,4.81767955801105

511491,3,6302787041,"I was disappointed in this film right from the beginning when Vin wasn't even mentioned.  I know that Garson divorced the actor by then, but it seemed as if the family just sort of misplaced a child.  The plot was corny, and the lack of a war took the drama right out of the film.  The original was compelling because it was filled with the fear and tension of the Blitz, the family's devotion, and the many plot twists that moved the film from crisis to crisis.  One truly cared about the characters---plus, Judy and Toby were adorable. (only British kids can do adorable--classy adorable)  In The ""Miniver Story"", all there is to follow is a tepid, non-affair, and exactly when the newly-uninteresting Mrs. M will exit, stage left.",1402963200,,733,4.651162790697675

511583,5,6302787041,"Well here it is .....the Miniver story the follow up to the much loved, highly successful - four Oscars - Mrs Miniver. Greer and Walter - the proper pecking order (That's despite me being a Walter Pigeon fan too !) are recruited again, to satisfy the overwhelming clamour from 1940's cinema going audience for a return of this enchanting married couple and the rest of their family and neighbours.
Well what happened Hollywood, run out of ideas did we? This film is set in one of the most dramatic and eventful eras in history - WW2 and this is all the Hollywood moguls could come up with? Well despite my obvious disappointment at the eventual story line, this is a welcome sequel the Miniver home front effort. But did they have to make it so sad .....and so final? I won't give away the ending - but despite that, this again is a wonderful watch as the 'Dynamic Duo' does it again and again just to show; even if budgets are short and hearts are not willing - it is neigh impossible to spoil a GOOD STORY.
Well worth the viewing for all you sentimental romantics out there.....enjoy. I did.",1395446400,2,1093,4.47

511587,2,6302787041,"Having viewed ""Mrs. Miniver"" many times throughout the years, I hadn't even heard of its sequel, ""The Miniver Story"".  Now I know why.  While ""Mrs. Miniver"" won six Academy Awards including Best Picture,  features outstanding performances by Greer Garson, Walter Pidgeon, and Henry Travers, boasts  a rich, warm, vibrant and inspiring script, and superb direction by William Wyler, ""The Miniver Story"" shares none of these attributes. The script is slow and predictable, the performances are lifeless and mediocre and the direction by H.C. Potter is unimaginative and, at best, adequate. The overall film is dull, dismal and  disappointing.  It leads one to wonder just why it was made after the glorious ""Mrs. Miniver"".",1386460800,2,720,5.327433628318584
511588,5,6302787041,"They just don't make movies like this any more. Sigh.

I grew up in the UK during the Blitz and still remember, all too well, being pulled out of bed and hurried to the bomb shelter at the end of the garden, as well the sounds of planes overhead and distant bombs falling. While it's true that there are no battle scenes, the story of what Britain's ordinary people personally endured during WWII is beautifully told. Almost the best part of the movie is about the rescue of the entire British and French armies, 400,000 men in all, by the English small boat owners from the beach at Dunkirk where they were hopelessly trapped between a German total bombardment and the sea. Because the water was so shallow, the Navy ships couldn't get into the beach. Instead, were they were forced drop anchor and wait several miles out. Not knowing what else to do, the British government put out a desperate call for help to any individual who owned a small fishing or pleasure boat to go to Dunkirk and ferry the trapped soldiers, a few at a time, to the waiting fleet. The courage and heroism of the ordinary volunteers who went back and forth, unarmed, in their small boats for five days through the German barrage, is almost indescribable. Incredibly, they rescued almost all of the waiting men, sometimes only four and five at a time. Only one other movie that I know of that tells this incredible story, (of which few, if any, of the younger generation are even aware) is Paul Gallico's ""The Snow Goose"". I watched it on TV years ago but, unfortunately, the Gallico estate has made it unavailable.",1385683200,,1591,4.582456140350877
511589,5,6302787041,"Having seen this film first in April on TMCs salute to Garson as their Star of the Month, I didn't know what to expect. First reaction was So-so. However, on numerous other viewings after I bought my own copy, I have grown VERY fond of the film and Garson's sensitive, 'wistful' very understated performance. Most moving scene is in the doctors office ""You're going to tell me something. Something I want to know."" Highly recommend the film..and it deserves several viewings to fully appreciate her performance.
As to what happened to their older son, Vin, the story line - unstated- would be that he had died in the war. In real life..some of you may know that Greer Garson married Richard Ney in 1943. He was eleven years younger than she was. Ney did go off to serve in the Navy in the Pacific theatre. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. So,  when the script was being written for the sequel, he was totally omitted from any mention. Too painful.
Enjoy this wonderful film! I have a computer program which 'ripped' my 2 DVDs - so I now have both Miniver films on my both my iPad and my iPhone.",1376438400,4,1100,4.472636815920398
