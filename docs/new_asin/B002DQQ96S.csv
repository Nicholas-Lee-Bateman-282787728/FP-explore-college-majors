3912418,4,B002DQQ96S,"This film is about an FBI agent, Matt Cvetic, who is under deep cover in order to infiltrate the Communist Party of the USA. He spends nine years working his way into the inner circle of the CPUSA in Pittsburg at a time when American communists were being used to subvert several agencies of the Federal government as well as formenting labor and race conflicts among the working class. Based on a true story, this movie offers insight into how the Party operated in the United States: injuring, killing or otherwise silencing those who oppose them, citing Freedom of Speech and other American rights to cloak themselves in false patriotism and filibustering to get their way in legitimate unions. Although very Hollywood, this film is still an excellent movie that does justice to those men and women who watched for subversion during the Cold War.",1407715200,4,849,4.862068965517241

To make matters worse the letter is stolen by Eve when the priest breaks up the fight.
Good chase scene in a tunnel with Matt and Eve being chased by two red gunmen.

3912422,3,B002DQQ96S,"Fast pacing noir film, when the communist activity was forbidden in America. Now? they are every where because we chose the president who love socialism, and communism. ""Communist youth at every college, Communist women's group, every unions support communism... It's sad that so many people nowadays try to change this nation into communist or socialism ( same role, just different name) not really knowing the truth, just based on some political ideology that human history had repeatedly proved to be failed. In fact communism is the worst political system that ever presented on earth. Because of its brutality, I escaped from that regime. And I am happy to be in this country where human freedom is mostly respected, and protected. Communist lies saying every one shares equally: In fact only, those few comrades who caused the shift of power enjoy the wealth and power, but the rest of the general citizens have no equality nor basic human right. Any one speak against government---disappear next day to ""concentration camp"" w/o fair trials nor justice. Communist shut down all religious freedom, or freedom of speech ( all medias are government controlled) Communists deny any form of gods but instead, they set the status of Stalin or Ma chiding, or Kimjung ill, and have to sing songs and salute for them, worship them. From elementary children to elders... Anyone dares to go against the government, ---labor camp! Several millions who stand for their freedom were killed brutally in early 20th century, during the communism overturn. 1989, Tinamen square, a million chines college students marched to protest against their communist government of oppression: it was broadcasted all over the world, they were asking communist government to give them ;freedom for speech, media, business, religion, true-democracy( not like few communist party people controlling) by election. Sooner the communist government sent them tanks and guns and indiscriminately shoot them and ran over with tank. Whole world watched through television broadcast. There is no ""equal Justice"" like the communist ideologist deceives people. Only ""Elite Party Comrades"" have the privileges of special health care, food market for themselves only, supply stores for them only, but the rest of the citizens live in dirt poor situation deprived from basic human rights. It's just a power shift from have to have not. Maybe somebody to arrange some ""exchange living tourism"" between these communist countries and America, Send those ""Deceived communism lovers"" to live in those communist countries for a year or two years by themselves without any privileges as American, but just as like their citizen, then maybe all these communism, socialism, totalitarian  movement in American will learn the true lessons of the reality, and waken up. Also, reading the books by real defects form those communist countries will give real ideas, not just full of bologna, lying ideology (theory) books
Now some ignorant Americans already forgot about this just 20 years ago's brutality that we watched with our own eyes, want to change this great nation into communist?
Please study the real history. I mean the ""real history"" not just that stupid ""ideology of communist"". In a word, if you study the true history, communist repeatedly failed last 150 years.
and it's the most evil regime in the history. Why?: Stalin communist government killed 90 millions including the vicinity nations that were turn into communism, Macho-tong communist killed 100 millions, 2 millions by North Korea, by Cambodia each, 2 millions in Africa, 200,000 latin America..so on . But most of all they all became terribly poor after communist regime,oppressing the free capitalism, except China, because they started to adapt the partial capitalism from 10 years ago after they realized the harsh economic state. Now history tells also other evil regime; Hitler killed 6 million jew with other 4 million of Europeans; Japan' imperialism killed 20 million Asians during WWII, ..so on.
Men can't govern themselves. They always proved to be failed again and again throughout the history. Collect the real facts, separate from the author's propaganda. Lineup the real facts, then you see the history more accurately. Always develop the ""reasoning power"" of your own this way , not swayed by many false propagandas in most books out there. If you don't have your own reasoning power, you will be always vulnerable and get deceived.

Research the communism nations' history. All the nations turned into communism fall into worst human rights and economic state from their establishment. Any communist countries in the history ever get better as decades go by?China is the only seemingly doing well now. Why? because from 10 years ago, they realized communism was failed with extreme poverty, started to adapting the partial capitalism into their system-free competitive capitalism. They are actually hybrid with communism with partial democratic system, but still, anyone speak against party: labor camp w/o fair trail, all medias have to only report what government want:can't. They lie that they have religious freedom, even has a yellow page church lists,but if you go those address, they are all locked. If you openly have church meeting: Another concentration camp trip! That's the reality people. If USA turned into communism, the power will shift to only those who hate the existing American system. They secretly controlling communicast-medias ( I already see it happened ) and brainwashing the youth with distorted facts in textbooks last 20 years. They keep change their names, their activity, and theory. Why? if they openly speak up, they know they will fail because any normal mind people will see the deception and its perversion. Look at these behind scene head members:They are mostly angry people with extreme hatred. Before you get associate with these kinds, study the actual communism history and the result of those countries over last 100 years. then you might understand why people escape from those communist countries despite the danger of their lives, come to USA. Americans seem so ignorant , don't even know what kind of freedom or dreams that anyone can pursue if they want. I can't believe how americans are lazy and stupid (sorry for my expression) not protecting their precious freedom and the wealth that whole world envy. Pretty sad to see this great nation is stumbling by the smooth, deceitful talking, present government and together with mostly blinded, deceivedmajority. My last word: America wake up and protect what your forefathers gave to you. Don't get robbed by those haters of your wealth and power. If America had been the most wealthy and liberal nation in the whole world so far, doesn't it already proved what you have is the best national system already?Do you have to be a rocket scientist to see this simple truth? Don't be deceived. Though there are some defectiveness of the free-market -capitalism, still when it comes to human dignity and god given , basic human freedom, communism and socialism are the evil, and total failures!",1296432000,13,7124,5.204703832752613
3912423,4,B002DQQ96S,"This is a review for I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE F.B.I. (1951) directed by Gordon Douglas.  I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE F.B.I. is the story of Pittsburgh steel worker and union official Matt Cvetic, played by Frank Lovejoy,  who joined the Communist Party U.S.A. as an undercover agent  at the government's request.  When his communist membership became well known Cvetic lost his friends and was shunned by his family, including his teen- aged son.
Eventually he meets his son's high school teacher and becomes involved with her even though she, too, is a party member.  Despite his actual political convictions Cvetic continues recruiting and otherwise working for the communist party until the day comes when he is slated to testify against the Pittsburgh party officials
and after nine years underground he is allowed to reveal himself to everyone he knows.

The only place I have seen I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE F.B.I.called a film noir  is a book titled ""Death On The Cheap: The Lost B Movies Of Film Noir""by Arthur Lyons and even there it is just listed, not really discussed.
However, I believe that a noir case can be made for this film  by pointing out that the protagonist, Matt Cvetic, after nine years undercover is scorned by just about everyone he knows but still stays in Pittsburgh and takes all the hatred and sheer dislike and distrust apparently turning the other cheek most every time.  Just because he has a greater purpose, to expose the party when, and only when,  our government gives him the order. If that isn't a hellish existence, almost losing himself in the abyss of hatred and paranoia,and fighting himself to suppress his true feelings just about every day,  I don't know what is.
So I would rate I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE F.B.I. as a film noir, although certainly not the  kind of film we usually think of when noir is mentioned.

Over all I think I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE F.B.I. is a well made, fast paced movie with believable performances by everyone on screen.  Just as it was released the undeclared Korean War heated up and it was an actual(sort of) wartime film, depicting our enemies as spies and sabatours, which happened to be  true.
In any event, I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE F.B.I. is a window into the past of sixty years ago and unfortunately, we're facing some of the same situations these days as well.

3912424,4,B002DQQ96S,"This is a Warner Archive product. It is a DVD-R with no extras. There are also no chapter stops. You may only go forwards and backwards in 10 minute increments.

According  to the Wikipedia, ""I Was a Communist for the FBI"" was the name of a series of articles written by Matt Cvetic that appeared in the Saturday Evening Post. The stories were later turned into a best-selling book, an American espionage thriller radio series,  and also this motion picture. Mr. Cvetic's articles were the true story of his undercover life, but the radio show and this film were largely fictionalized for dramatic effect. Matt Cvetic was actually an undercover agent for the FBI posing as a Communist for nine years. It is true that he alienated his family and friends as a result of them believing that he was actually a Communist, and even wound up divorced as a result of his assignment, although the divorce is not mentioned in the film. It is not true that the Communists posed as big a threat to the U.S. from within as is shown in the motion picture. The film itself is quite interesting and a pretty good thriller in its own right. It will keep you guessing as to whether or not Cvetic's true identity will be revealed before he is finished collecting information.

You just have to forget about the stretching of the truth that goes on here and enjoy this film for what it is  - a window into a particularly paranoid time in America with a good pace to it. A film that is equivalent to it and made about the same time is the better known ""Big Jim McLain"" starring John Wayne. It too has many wild stereotypes, but the action is good and you just have to remember when and why it was made. If you do that, you should thoroughly enjoy both films.

The audio and video were both excellent. There were hardly any scratches in the video, and the sound was very clear and undistorted. Considering its interesting subject matter and good condition it's too bad Warner didn't release this as a pressed DVD with some kind of commentary.",1254441600,8,2020,4.505464480874317

saw was not what they wanted.  Not understanding the freedom we had in America with it's flaws they became dupes
of handlers who used whatever necessary to make sure that their marks performed as directed.  A movie back in a time before
America started on a journey of change.  And as we became more Globalist we shoved aside the way we were infiltrated and

I know, incredible, right? The Federal Bureau of Investigation are the good guys, for a nice change. This is the story of an F.B.I. agent who is inserted into a communist cell in Pittsburg and who witnesses the under-the-belt tactics of these operators, vis a vis the unions and their efforts at demonstrations and strikes, in the steel industry. The Party or cell wants to disrupt the economy of the U.S. We get a sobering and subtle refresher course in the art of rebellion and subversion, that is like a therapeutic tonic, compared with the irrelevant noise and distraction which is relentlessly being pumped out by Hollywood, these days.
