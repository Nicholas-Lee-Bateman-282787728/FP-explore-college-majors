7801647,5,1932976507,"As the final Doolittle Raiders reunion (71 st) took place in April 2013, this is an excellent time to view this film.  Actual WWII film footage is used. Filmed in 2005, several of the remaining Raiders are interviewed as well as Coloned Glines, author of The Doolittle Raid.  As a Baby Boomer, this film helped me to appreciate how important this mission was as a turning point of the outcome of WWII.  I highly recommend this film.",1379203200,,432,4.584415584415584
