8281543,3,B001B2LLK4,"Too much of the video is scenes of students doing the same move over and over again. Teacher shows move then students do it ad nauseam. Three to five reps would have been enough.  Content was good but there could have been so much more in the same length video without the worthless student repetition.  The video covered how to handle the initial confrontation but could have provided more follow through.

Production quality was very low but content was enough for 3 stars.

I bought.video directly from CFA website as a download for $10 less than DVD price ($20).",1402099200,,566,4.686868686868687
8281544,1,B001B2LLK4,"I love Sammy but this book was not very good. I do not recommend. Get his video First Strike or and the book First Strike and you will be happy.
I will keep looking into his catalog and let you know. He's worthwhile reading and viewing besides this one clunker I stumbled on.",1389657600,,275,4.2075471698113205
8281545,5,B001B2LLK4,"Anger, emotions and verbal abuse are all part of street confrontation and are all used in this DVD to teach the real world reactions we need to know in dealing with tough and let's face it - scary situations.
This specific DVD left me feeling empowered and confident in just my first viewing.
Nothing training intensive, and completely understandable and usable in real life situations.
I am a fan of Sammy's training DVD's and this one in particular is useful to anyone and everyone.

Recommended!",1365379200,,498,4.858823529411764

8281547,4,B001B2LLK4,"In close quarters, you don't have time to react. You have to act. Your action will determine whether or not you go home with minimal injury or whether or not you go home at all. Forewarned is forearmed and this DVD should already be part of your library. This guide provides simple instruction for dealing with the guy who's encroaching you aggressively or even seemingly just getting too close for your comfort. When you know what to do (and this top-rate instruction will teach you) you will be able to deal with those close-quarter situations.",1241481600,2,546,4.757894736842105
8281548,5,B001B2LLK4,"The encroachment scenarios theis DVD discusses are by far the most common way fights begin. You should be aware of your surroundings at all times, but rarely does an attack come out of nowhere without some sort of provocation, threat, or build-up. The majority of fights start with words before they become violent. This DVD teaches you how to attempt to diffuse the situation, how to be ready for any eventuality, and how to defend against the most common attacks used by an encroacher. With these skills, your encroacher won't know it, but you will be the one in complete control of the situation. I don't just highly recommend this DVD, I consider it to be among the essential materials everyone who studies Reality Based Self Defense should own.",1214092800,3,749,4.813953488372093
