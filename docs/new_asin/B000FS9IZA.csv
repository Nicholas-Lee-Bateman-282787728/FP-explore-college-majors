8126076,5,B000FS9IZA,"Basu Chaterjee is the master of Independent Indian cinema!  Although this is a less known film from him, it's very enjoyable and well made.  Delightful to see the frosty Chemistry professor slowly warm up to the cheerful (and nerdy) Dharmendra.  The direction is also brilliant and Chaterjee's use of a character's thoughts onscreen is unique.  The film stock has suffered due to lack of preservation, but if you're willing to forgive some discoloration, you will be rewarded with a quality movie.",1455494400,,497,5.098765432098766

8126078,2,B000FS9IZA,"This is a 1978 comedy about two college teachers falling in love and getting married. There is absolutely nothing spectacular about the story line or the acting crew. The photography is very good. The movie did not do well in the box office.

There are many double messages that are contradictory. If they are meant as comedy, they are not funny enough. The most obvious of them is that Renu, the strict, unsmiling, disciplinarian teacher wears too many extremely transparent saris, which she does not even bother to tuck around her waist. She always wears it in one layer, showing of too much of her skin and her blouses. Clad in such revealing wardrobe, she is criticizing and disciplining college girls, who are dressed modest and decent.

There are some 'funny' scenes. The college lessons in Chemistry do not go beyond the 'properties of carbon dioxide'. The Sanskrit lessons do not go beyond some romantic excerpts. The attention of the teachers is on the next room where their secret lover is teaching. The students are having a curiously funny time.

Not very entertaining.",1266624000,,1081,4.896174863387978
