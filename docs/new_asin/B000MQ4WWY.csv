2738416,5,B000MQ4WWY,"Each episode in the pack is its own DVD.  Also each DVD you can set to run for a specific time or episode selection.  My son loves to watch the street in the morning while I get his breakfast ready;  this gives him something to watch on the weekends when sesame street is not on when he gets up.  Also these are great to leave one at Grandma's or to put in different rooms- ensuring that your toddler always has access to ""the street.""",1244246400,2,435,4.142857142857143

2738419,5,B000MQ4WWY,This set is not so bad.  I purchased this because it was less expensive per DVD than the other sets.  My 18 month old daughter loves it!  She was singing her ABC's in Target and it took me awhile to understand but she must have learned them on this DVD!,1184284800,4,253,4.02
2738420,2,B000MQ4WWY,"These are nowhere near as good as the ""Old School"" editions.  These *might* be better than nothing, but I'm disappointed in the difference between them.

What they really need to do is expand on the Old School vols 1-3.",1178668800,14,219,4.589743589743589

8170582,5,B000MQ4WWY,"Another Sesame Street Favorite for my 20 mth old!  Anytime I can pickup a pack of multiple episodes I cannot complain!  Daughter adores these as well as Elmo's World Dvds!  She learns from these, gets to sing and dance, and I can put them in and do not have a care in the world about the content.  No one is dressed inappropriately.  Kids are taught the values I wish more parents would make a priority, and she absolutely enjoys them, laughing and smiling the entire time.",1384300800,,473,4.453488372093023

8170584,1,B000MQ4WWY,"Why does the title of the listing say (1969)? Didn't know it was going to be a modern (2007) version. Also, the above editorial review is a review of another completely different disc. Actually the first disc has Seth Green and is the Letter of the month Club brought to you by R and 18. Second disc is Furry Red Monster Parade brought to you by F and 6. Someone should sort this out so that buyers can receive what they anticipate. I bought this specifically because it said it had Spanish language audio option...NOT so at all.",1260316800,9,529,4.408163265306122
