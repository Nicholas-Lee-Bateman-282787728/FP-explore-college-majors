780552,1,6304101147,"This was not a good movie. For one simple reason: ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" was never meant to have a sequel. How could it?  (Spoilers for the first movie ahead.)  Charlie B. Barkin died in the first movie. He went  to Heaven. Itchy stayed with Anne-Marie. That's how the movie ended, how it  was meant to end. Charlie was not meant to suddenly decide he felt bored in  Heaven (how could anyone be _bored_ in Heaven?) and come back to Earth. He  already _had_ a second chance to come back to Earth and redeem himself. In  the first movie. That's that. And Charlie in the sequel was not the Charlie  we all know and love from the first movie. First of all, Charlie Sheen did  a find job and all, but I'm sorry; Burt Reynolds _is_ Charlie B. Barkin.  That's all there is to it. But it's more than that. Charlie did not really  act like he did in the first movie. Completely different character. But I  think the biggest problem I have with this sequel is that it is _such_ a  cheap movie in comparison to the original. The original was about love and  redemption and honor and loyalty and friendship. About letting some  cynicism of the world go and letting hope come back into your life. That  effect was lost in the sequel. The sequel was a cartoon; the original was  an animated classic _movie_. This was one of my Dad's favorite movies, and  when he passed away nearly a year ago, the original was heart-warming to  watch. It helped me to believe in hope (""You know, good-byes aren't  forever.""). In my heart, at least, I know that Charlie is still in  Heaven, and Anne-Marie (and Itchy) will see him again one day!  Don't waste  your time with this sequel . . .see the original classic. _That_ movie will  warm your heart.",948326400,18,1723,4.396825396825397

It does make sense though because of course it really can't be darker themed since they are all in Heaven now and Heaven is supposed to be light and happy. But I also agree that the musical numbers are really cheesy and mostly unnecessary. I just enjoyed watching Charlie and Itch's story continue because I loved those guys.

780762,2,6304101147,"To be specific, I'm gonna be talking about the blu-ray edition. I know the comment will show that by the title, but I know sometimes it's easy to miss that.

So All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 was a cash grab, nearly 10 years after the first film came out. It has a different director (Or directors I should say), only one returning actor, Dom DeLuise as Itchy, a generic love plot, a basic heaven and hell fight, and enough songs to fill a soundtrack album, and kill about 20 minutes of screentime. Vic Tayback was replaced by Ernest Borgnine as Vic had passed away, and honestly I think Ernest adds a bit more life to the character. Then Burt Reynolds is replaced with Charlie Sheen, which is a massive downgrade, even back then.

So the story is basically Itchy is reunited with Charlie in heaven, and Charlie is bored stiff with the afterlife. Carface, however, makes a deal with the devil (Which, is he the devil? At one point they say his ""boss yanked his leash"" in reference to the devil character, so he might just be a powerful demon) and steals Gabriel's horn, which the devil wants to use to... blow open the gates of heaven and trap all the heavenly dog souls in the cells of Alcatraz... Why? I have no idea. Just to be a jerk? There's no real motivation aside from the devil character being a cat and really hating dogs. There's no intentions displayed of taking over heaven once all the dogs are cleared out or anything.

So when Carface drops the horn over San Francisco, Charlie volunteers himself and Itchy to go find it, and while there, he falls in love with another dog singing at another junkpile casino, and also gets tangled up with a runaway kid who wants nothing more than to become a street magician. Meanwhile, he also has to make his own deal with the devil because one trick of him going back to Earth to retrieve it as that nobody can see him aside from angels or demons. ""Red"" as this devil character likes to be called gives him a special collar that makes him flesh and blood when he's wearing it but says it'll only work for a day, and when it stops working he basically tricks Charlie into giving him the horn. Good and evil fight, good conquers evil, blah-blah-blah, this movie is terrible.

What's even worse is this blu-ray transfer of the film. I recently picked up this and the first movie on blu-ray because I've had them on DVD for years but never in widescreen. Now, this appears to be a case where the fullscreen was made off an unmatted version of the film so for both movies, your fullscreen copies are going to show off more frame than the widescreen. But I'm a believer in ""this is how it was intended to be seen."" Aside from that, the color in this release is terrible. Now the old DVD was a little pale - the colors seemed kind of washed out, nothing really popped. Now a few scenes on this blu-ray look very nice - the glow in Red's eyes when Charlie first meets him definitely pops and looks way better than the old DVD. But for the most part, this disc looks dark and dingy. That works for the first movie as the first All Dogs is VERY dark in its colors and themes. This one though is a bright, vibrant romp. A chase on a motorscooter from a police car during the daytime looks like it's happening in a crime noir at dusk. It feels like all the scenes have a black tint on them for some reason.

And on top of that, the blu-ray even has a few errors. There's line right at the beginning of the movie that, for some reason, is out of synch. My first thought was ""This is a mid-90s non-Disney sequel, of course they sort of skimped around the corners here and there."" Then I put in my fullscreen DVD and the line was synched PERFECTLY on that disc. And it's just that one line! Right when Itchy gets sent to heaven, he asks ""Am I... dead?"" and Charlie responds ""As a dog that eats chicken bones."" Both of those lines are way off their mark, and the lines before and after it are synched. Why it's like this on just the blu-ray is beyond me. On top of that, there's another error that doesn't affect me but might someone else - if you speak a language other than English, do not expect to know what's going on in any of the songs. The closed captions in Spanish and French seem to stop anytime a song starts, and on the dub tracks it's the same deal. The dubs stop and revert to English at any point when someone is singing. Once again, pulled out my old DVD - such was not the case there (Well, at least for the subtitles, I didn't really check the dubs on there).

In short, MGM or 20th Century Fox - somebody - slapped together a crummy release for a crummy movie, and since it's nothing majorly beloved or adored, chances are it's never going to get a rerelease that fixes these problems. (Something that was on both the DVD and the blu-ray - for some reason during the end climax, some of the shots look double exposed. I have no idea why.) I guess I'm glad the movie got a blu-ray release at all, but little to no effort was put into releasing it. And chances are nobody cares.

But I love All Dogs, even at its worst, so I care. If you've never seen it and love the first movie, don't pursue this one. I'm just a fan of animation and Don Bluth (Even though he basically had nothing to do with this one). Even if you have young kids, this film is SAFER than the first (If you haven't watched the first All Dogs Go To Heaven in a while or ever, check it out - that film is thematically DARK. And I love it for being that way.), but I don't know if they'll be all that interested in it. As far as quality for releases go though, if you still have a DVD copy (The two pack usually sells for $5 or so), just keep that. You don't need to upgrade.",1430611200,,5690,4.2387096774193544

780984,5,6304101147,"I'm giving this a five stars because I like this sequel to the classic ADGTH very much. Also I think this movie gets a lot of undeserved hate as being a ""poor film and sequel"" and I don't think that's entirely true at all. However just because I'm giving it five stars doesn't mean I won't point out a few of the mistakes.
1. Anne Marie was not even mentioned and that bothered me a little considering her role in the first movie and how close her and Charlie came to be. However maybe they didn't because of what happened to the actress and if that's the reason then I understand.
2. Animation isn't as great nor the songs but they are both still good.
3. Lot of different voice actors. Charlie Sheen as Charlie(coincidence, ha!) is pretty good but Burt Reynolds is missed very much. The voice actor for carface was different, but did decent and so did the voice actor for Annabelle albeit a bit whiny. Plus Charlie's personality seems different but sort of makes sense seeing as what happened with him in the first and there is the big time plot hole.

I know that seems like a lot but honestly if you can over look those small details then this a good film. Is it as good or as heartfelt as the first, no but when are sequels ever better than the original. Any fan of the first one should give this one a chance, you may like it or you may not.",1408147200,2,1347,4.2412451361867705

781162,3,6304101147,"It's not the worst sequel I've ever seen, but this is an instance where MGM made a follow-up that doesn't even compare to the original.  Although Sasha, Itchy, and Red represent characters who are pretty well done in their own right, characters like Charlie and Carface can seem unlikable because of some odd decisions made during production.  There's really no excuse why they chose to replace Burt Reynolds with Charlie Sheen when it's clear the former was a much better choice in the first place and Carface looks like some sort of buffoon compared to his delightfully villianous version in the original movie.  The most off-putting thing about the second movie is that the tone and feel was a drastic departure from the previous film.  The first movie was designed to be a family film through and through, but it dealt with some dark and heavyhanded tones that made it feel special to me.  The sequel has none of those things though the movie itself is pretty to look at.  Finally, the sequel's quality suffers from some shoddy production values.  Charlie's normal voice and his singing voice are distractingly dissimilar from one another and there are glaring animation errors such as characters' mouths not moving when they're talking or singing.

781372,5,6304101147,"I love All Dogs Go To Heaven 2. This is a fun adventure movie and it is bright and colorful. The characters are memorable and the film has nice voice acting. This movie is much more upbeat than the first one. It also has a beautiful song in it called ''I Will Always Be With You''.

The film is about Charlie Barkin who is in heaven with Carface, and Annabelle (the Whippet Angel from the first) is giving a speech about how all dogs deserve a second chance. She mentions if any dog wins a medal, they can go come back to life and live on Earth again. At the beginning, Itchy goes to heaven and meets Charlie, we find out Itchy died because he choked on a chicken bone. Charlie then shows Itchy around heaven and Charlie explains that he is bored and he would love to go back to Earth. Later, Carface steals Gabriel's horn, which is the horn that opens heaven's gate, and he goes back down to Earth. Upon arrival, he loses the horn. Annabelle is then shocked, and asks Charlie and Itchy to go back to Earth to retrieve the horn, or else a disaster will happen. Before they leave, she gives them a ''Miracle'', a magic spell from heaven that can be used for anything.

When Charlie and Itchy get back to Earth, they go to a bar, but then they realize nobody can see them because they are angels. Then a beautiful female dog named Sasha starts performing on stage, and Charlie starts swooning. Charlie and Itchy then meet Carface and a dog he's working for, who gives them a magic collar that can make them visible.

We find out the dog is really an evil cat from the other side. The cat is trying to steal Gabriel's horn in order to open the gate to heaven and kidnap all the angels.

Charlie then follows Sasha home and then finds out she is taking care of a boy named David who ran away from home. The rest of the film is about Charlie, Itchy, Sasha, and David finding the horn and saving the angels from the evil cat.

This is a fun adventure movie that I totally recommend.",1369094400,,1976,4.258666666666667

I felt compelled to help some people by deciding if the blu ray version of this movie is right for them. Let start by saying that I collect all of Don Bluth animated classics, but whatever opinion you have about the movie itself, I respect. Not everyone can be pleased by the story-line selected by a director on any of old times classic tales. But as a collector that buys the blu blu ray versions of such tales, I expect that at least some special restoration is done in the video transfer to be worth the upgrade. Well that restoration is non existent in any of the Don Bluth movies. The only movie that is an exception is Anastasia. Other than that, they all deserve ONE STAR for video restoration.

This one had less profantity than the original but still not clean enough in my opion to be g rated. This should be fine if you 8 or older. Charlie returns  but played by a different actor. Carface is in heaven.  Where he should not have gone after the way he treated Charlie in the original film. Other than Charlie, Itch Anabella and Careface none of the charters from the previous movie are in it.  Charlie must  go to earth to recover Gabriels horn after its droped by Carface while he attemps to steal it. This was the second to last entry in the series.  I am plaining on writing a grown up version of the original movie with more violence, language and more action.  The ending the first movie should have had.  Charlie ends will be the same but carface's will change. He will return to Ann Morry in the sequels when he goes to retrive Gabriel's horn.  The King gator will return Asmodous, Scragg  from Redwall and Golloum from the Hobbit Lord of the Rings and return of king (Original animated versions)  Will help charlie as they plan there escape from hell and the down fall of Sauron and Melificent and the plan the  destruction of hell.",1130803200,2,1237,4.400881057268722
781482,3,6304101147,"The first movie was a good film that I felt was underrated. What happens when you an animated film with a good dark story and make a softened up sequel? The result is All Dogs Go To Heaven 2. Charlie Sheen brings a different likeliness to the Charlie Barkin character than Burt Reynolds. With Burt Reynolds, Charlie had a slight tough guy attitude. With Sheen, Charlie (the dog) has a more sympathetic personality. Itch's selfish steak returns but not as bad as the first film. I don't like musicals much but the first song ""It's Too Heavenly Here"" doesn't directly show Charlie's feelings towards heaven. He seems bored but of course that's the message that they're trying to give the viewer. Still, I would done that song in the form of hard rock. One thing that gets me is that this movie takes place in modern day San Francisco and the first movie took place in 1939 New Orleans. You'd most likely think that Charlie spent all those years in heaven but the fact that Itchy enters heaven towards the beginning of the movie kills that theory. Carface seems more like a bumbling idiot in this film than the ruthless killer that he was in the first film. It has a bit of a heartwarming story but if you've seen the first film, there's a big chance you'll be dissappointed with this one.",1110931200,,1286,4.523605150214593

781524,2,6304101147,"I dunno.  This movie made me think of something George Carlin said: ""Wherever ideas are concerned, Americans can be counted on to do one of two things: Take a really good idea and run it completely into the ground, or take a really bad idea and run it completely into the ground.""
Part of the appeal of the first movie was the dark theme, the lovable characters, and the bittersweet story.  In other words, it was the kind of movie that, when you were done watching it, you didn't know how to feel about the ending.  Mixed emotions.
Remember reading ""Where the Red Fern Grows,"" and feeling that same way at the end?  Part of the reason that book was so good is because it makes you feel that way.
I believe the people who wrote this sequel wanted to do two things: They wanted to make a quick buck, sure... but not only that, they wanted to continue the story with a script designed to negate those mixed emotions the first movie produced.  They were soft and weak, and couldn't stomach a movie that didn't have a clear-cut happy ending.  So they produced something inferior that completely destroyed the magic of the original story, all in an effort to set things straight.
I gave it two stars for it's good-hearted (yet lame) attempt to reach out to the children of divorced parents, but as far as I'm concerned, this sequel never happened.",1059696000,11,1342,4.502057613168724

The film itself gives the viewer nice looking animation, songs and introduces new characters. Okay so that's fine. The animation however is not as catchy (or dark) as it was in All Dogs Go To Heaven 1 and therefore the characters look a bit different. The first film had songs integrated in it and so does this one. Although in the original film had doggies singing the songs too I find the singing dogs in All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 to be a little corny. The songs are nice however. New characters are fine too and Charlie Sheen's voice fits Charlie okay.

Some parents (particularly religiously inclined ones) may have qualms with the depiction of heaven (i.e. it's for Ned Flanders types, and is so boring it makes an earthly life look very appealing), with Irish setter Sasha's nightclub scene (seemingly modelled on Jessica Rabbit's number from 'Who Framed RR' (it's also a highlight of the film), and with a few moments of dialogue which are definately not aimed at kids, but blink and you've missed them (which would be a shame, because they're rather funny)

They did a pretty bad job matching Charlie's and  Annabelle's.  I mean, Annie's voice actually ANNOYED me!  And Sasha.. don't  get me started.  I always thought Charlie and Flo (the Collie from the  first movie) were a cute couple.  If anyone is considering buying this  movie, I WOULD NOT recomend it.",969062400,4,681,4.442622950819672
