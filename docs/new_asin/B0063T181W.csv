8492193,4,B0063T181W,The DVDs in this collection do not seem to have the sharpness of the original older version.,1515283200,,92,4.470588235294118
8492194,3,B0063T181W,"BAYWATCH was centered around the work of a team of lifeguards and their interpersonal relationships, with plots usually centering on dangers related to beach and other activities pertinent to the Southern California (later Hawaii) beach lifestyle. Everything from earthquakes to shark attacks to serial killers, and even nuclear bombs, served as plot conflicts on the show.

Saving people from drowning tended to be one of the most typical situations used in the shows. Thus a trademark of the show was slow motion shots of the lifeguards running, most notably done by Erika Eleniak (Shauni), Pamela Anderson (CJ), Yasmine Bleeth (Caroline), Alexandra Paul(Stephanie), and David Charvet (Matt) along with David Hasselhoff (Mitch) during the height of the show, especially when this show took place at the L.A. County beaches, such as Malibu, Santa Monica, and Venice.

In the meantime, you can catch BAYWATCH on Cozi-TV every weeknight.",1504828800,,936,5.404109589041096

8492198,3,B0063T181W,"This disc contains the best episode of Baywatch but does not feature the best part which was taken off air for being to ""adult"", and the scene is not to adult by todays standards. So I would not recommend this unless your a hard core Baywatch fan, otherwise watch clips of this show on youtube.",1494201600,,294,4.363636363636363
8492199,5,B0063T181W,"I am happy that I was finally able to find Baywatch on DVD.  It has the original theme song on it.  This Region 0 DVD plays fine in my DVD player.  The only thing that I do not like is that it did not have an insert telling you which episodes are on which DVD.  The case was damaged in shipping, so the plastic piece that holds the DVD was broken and falls out of the case when it is opened.",1490745600,,391,3.7901234567901234
