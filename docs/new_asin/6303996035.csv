7859324,5,6303996035,"Just a hint for True Crime buffs.  This program came in a three part boxed set from Nova called ""Murder and Mayhem"" and included The Sam Shepard case on one DVD, and the Serial Murderer Arthur Shawcross on the other.

  All three programs, including this one, ""The Hunt for the Serial Arsonist"" were excellent documentaries of the tracking down and ultimate prosecution of some of the more notorious criminals in the 20th Century.

Stacy Keach's narration of the ""Serial Arsonist"" DVD is superb, and the program documents the investigation, surveillance, and ultimate arrest of a Glendale California Fire Arson Inspector who himself committed numerous arson fires.

  During the 80's and 90's Fire Investigator John Orr set fires in Department Stores, Fabric Emporiums, and in the foothills of his own hometown of Glendale until he was caught from fingerprints found on one of his homemade matchbook igniters that failed to work in a linen shop.

  With the help of Federal ATF agents they hunted down Orr and put him in jail and continued to discover new fires he had set that caused the deaths of victims of his arson fires.

  This bizarre twist of fate, makes this program all the more interesting as Orr is initially presented as an ""Expert Witness"", only to realize he is being filmed while in prison serving his sentence as ""The Serial Arsonist.""  When purchased in the three pack set, this is an excellent value and well worth the time to view.",1243209600,2,1452,4.845528455284553
7859325,5,6303996035,This was a great video for Forensic Science. The students in my High School got an inside look at arson. Good demo of arson. Well done.,1217635200,2,135,4.230769230769231
