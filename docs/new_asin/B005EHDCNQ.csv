4665263,1,B005EHDCNQ,"No, this low-budget action is not an Alexandre Dumas adaptation. This is about Alexandra D'Artagnan (Heather Hemmens), a young and ambitious NSA agent who stumbles upon a sort of conspiracy. The ""three musketeers"" are secret agents whose latest mission goes terribly awry. They are martial artist Athos (Xin), computer wizard Porthos (Keith Allen) and Aramis (Michele Boyd) with guns. You will be watching veteran actor Alan Rachins playing ""the Cardinal"" so dead seriously.

No one would take such a story seriously. The incoherent story of this straight to DVD action doesn't make sense, a concoction of set-pieces that seem borrowed from other recent action movies. That would be fine as long as action set-pieces are fun. They are not, though watching cheesy effects and terrible acting may appeal to some in the same way as Ed Wood movies.

Those who know the studio The Asylum and their works should know what they will get in ""3 Musketeers."" This is a terrible film that reminds us that Paul W.S. Anderson's critically panned adaptation was not that bad, but somehow I couldn't hate ""3 Musketeers."" Heather Hemmens is not bad and she deserves a better role than this.",1331596800,,1174,4.98469387755102
4665264,2,B005EHDCNQ,"This film by low-budget direct-to-dvd house The Asylum is a mixed bag of silly, comic book action, uneven visual effects and even more uneven acting. The end result is ultimately a fun, if not altogether satisfying, time waster.

It's not a straight mockbuster of any ""Three Musketeers"" movie in Asylum's usual ""Transmorphers"" kind of way. Except for the title and some character names from the Dumas novel, the movie better resembles a ""Charlie's Angels"" film, as its plot centers around a team of action heroes attempting to stop a conspiracy to incite World War III.

The team code-named ""Musketeers"" consists of, predictably, spies whose own code names are Athos, Porthos and Aramis. They're joined later by an exotic-looking female spy named D'Artagnan who claims to be a direct descendant of the real one. Their enemy: A guy code-named ""The Cardinal"" (natch) who for reasons unclear wants to start a global war by killing the president.

The actors in the Musketeer roles are not too bad and actually appear to be having some fun, which is rare for The Asylum. Arguably the two sorest points in most Asylum productions is that their preposterous, low-budget movies are presented dead seriously, and that their has-been actors like Greg Evigan seem mortified to be appearing in them. Here it's Danny Glover, looking old and embarrassed for the 5 minutes or so he's in it.

Martial artist XIN is so charismatic as Athos you'll hope to see him in a better kung fu movie, lovely Michele Boyd as Aramis is reminiscent of Meg Ryan circa ""Innerspace,"" Keith Allan channels Jeff Goldblum as brainy Porthos who spouts '80s pop culture references like ""The light is green, the trap is clean,"" and Heather Hemmens (of the CW's ""Hellcats"") actually makes you believe a Costa Rican hottie could be the direct descendant of a 17th Century French guard.

But again, as with most Asylum movies, other cast members are so bad you'll wonder who on the production team they must be related to/have paid off/had sexual relations with to land their roles. ""L.A. Law"" alum Alan Rachins is so flat-out awful as the Cardinal he comes off as someone's old college acting teacher given the part as a favor. He pulls down every scene he's in so badly the movie actually appears to freeze-frame every time he comes on screen. Where's Barry Bostwick when you need him?

Digital effects by Tiny Juggernaut are typically bargain basement, but not so much that they ruin the show. This is, after all, comic book melodrama, so it's OK by me if the jet planes and rockets look a little cartoony.

It's mindless fun that's worth a look on Netflix or maybe picked up used for a couple of bucks. Paying any more for it would be a bigger crime than World War III.",1329696000,2,2731,4.773305084745763
4665265,1,B005EHDCNQ,Not what I expected--very disappointed.  It is nothing but a mockbuster.  Save your time and money unless you like low-budget knockoffs.,1325376000,,136,5.428571428571429
4665266,2,B005EHDCNQ,"The film starts out with some fairly good Asylum graphics, sound track, and Michele Boyd running around in her red bra and panties. I was wondering how Asylum could mess up a grindhouse movie. The suspense didn't last long. Porthos was horrifically, if not MST comically portrayed by Keith Allen attempting to imitate Jeff Goldblum. Unlike Ronald Reagan, Porthos is able to recall missiles after they are launched and has a magical Asylum notebook that can see anything in the sky. Of course the whole idea that a North Korean missile can launch straight and hit its target enters into the realm of fantasy that even Disney dare not go.

Heather Hemmens plays Agent D'Artangan who is a low level Pentagon employee who speaks Arabic and Chinese while being an Olympic fencer (I wonder how that will play in) and descends from the ""real"" Musketeers. She obtains her first field assignment and gets Steven Williams, the only decent actor in this film, killed just after he explains the plot. I find myself howling at what are supposed to be tense dramatic moments. For instance, if you say ""The Cardinal"" around Agent D'Artangan, she goes off like saying ""Niagara Falls"" in a Three Stooges episode. She also believes you can locate anyone on the planet from their junk mail because those people know how to find you.

Bad acting, bad plot, bad special effects.

Directed by: Cole McKay

Pretty amazing effort to entertain with a familiar name in action-adventure films.

The action stuff is truly breathtaking and moves really fast to plot points that make sense and add to excitement of effort.

The chracter names you are used to are here and the evil Cardinal is represented by LA LAW `s Alan Rachins.

The evilness continues with David Chokachi from BAYWATCH fame and he shows many skills that can still be added to his acting efforts.

The cameos reach a pinnacle with F13 JASON,Kane Hodder gives a fleeting character some horrible glee in his tasks.

This should be a big hit in rentals and sales, It has everything for the fan and even occasional viewer of Redbox or Netflix fodder.",1319587200,3,784,4.8059701492537314

8468209,4,B005EHDCNQ,"Ok, I'm a little late on this one but hey, it's still cool to catch up. This version of the 3 Musketeers was really good and during this time, you can also tell that The Asylum Studios have improved in the special effects department and honestly it wasn't that bad. Now, don't get me wrong, there were a lot of goofs on this film, some mistakes out in the open but hey, they only had 12 days to shoot this film!! Anyway, I still had a very good time with this flick!! Yes, I like junk food movies and yeah I know that this is complete cheese but the action is good, the stunts that Xin Sarith Wuku did himself was great! Although the fight scene between him and Treville the Cardinal (played by Alan Rachins) was really hokey. Obviously, if Xin's character didn't have the bullet wound then the fight would have been mismatched but at least the old man gave him a fight.

Overall the movie was good and not that bad. They were pretty much subpar on this one but the action is pretty decent. I do like the concept, the look and the up to date story telling that the movie has. Sure, it's a low budget movie but I think they pulled it off for and ""Ok"" verson of the 3 Musketeers. I'm sure many people have already written off this movie and bashed it for what it is but the cool thing is, it didn't bore me. Where it lacked in some areas, it was still able to get my attention and keep it throughout the film. Now that is a big plus in my book!!

This movie showed The Asylum's improvement for 2011 and it was one of the better movies that they released for that year. Hey, you can go wrong with guns, knives and bombs so at least this movie has lots of it!! So if you like junk food movies like I do, then this is for you!!!

8468212,1,B005EHDCNQ,"I bought this when I was collecting ""3 Musketeer"" movies. I knew it wouldn't be the original story. Or really even close. But I had hoped that they wouldn't have violated the name a classic story like this.

I'm all about artistic license. I'm all about suspension of disbelief with entertainment. I can support doing something entertainingly humorous and different with an idea we all know. None of that helped me get past the horrific dialog, story line and... well... just EVERYTHING about this movie. They $5 didn't even cast a shadow on how ripped off I felt wasting 1.5 hours of my life watching this travesty of ""entertainment"".",1352937600,,635,4.825688073394495

8468214,4,B005EHDCNQ,"First things first. This is not a  bad little movie. It doesn't have a ton of production values, but unless you're prepared to spend a ton of money on production, you get what you pay for. It's apparently by a little direct-to-video outfit I've never heard of, but what I saw doesn't reflect too badly on it.
  It's a fairly standard plot with the common and impossible action movie fantasy about a few heroes being able to exchange fire with millions of bad guys and never get a scratch except at the end. But every action movie is stupid this way. You quibble about that and you'd never be able to enjoy any action movie - including the splendid ""Avengers.""
  What it does have as others have noted are some pretty good actors who are probably headed for better things in the future, a serviceable plot, and a great sword fight at the end in a Presidential bunker. Come on, it doesn't get any cooler than that!
  What I particularly enjoyed was the way the template that is ""The Three Musketeers"" was transformed to a 21st century adventure, and it worked. I'm a fan of the book and movies. This time the Musketeers are not French soldiers serving the King of France but members of an American elite special forces team who take on the names of the original Musketeers.
  And the ""Cardinal"", who was the real life Cardinal Richelieu of the 17th century, is transformed to a spymaster with desires to start a new war. The Cardinal, in fact, is the only weak point in the movie. The thing that made the Cardinal fearsome in the original was that he never got his hands dirty. He was a spider at the center of his web maneuvering others to do his dirty work. He'd never descend to fistfighting with the heroes.
  But, by and large, this latest reincarnation moving the story away from France and the 17th century works.
  I'm sure Alexandre  Dumas could never in his wildest fantasies have imagined what his story would become, but like Sherlock Holmes, the vehicle is sturdy enough to be reinvented again and again.
  That's probably because the story is about bravery and loyalty and devotion to your friends and how the young must prove themselves to the older generation before they themselves become the older generation.
  It's also fascinating to see how Dumas' story of drinking, wenching hard living warriors who enjoy women's favors (and bodies) become female warriors - and hot ones at that. It's probably not a coincidence that the 21st century Musketeers are half female and the toughest half of the team.
  So while I wouldn't spend a king's ransom - sorry, couldn't help it - to see ""3 Musketeers"" if you can get it reasonably priced, it's worth watching.",1345939200,,2669,4.626326963906582
