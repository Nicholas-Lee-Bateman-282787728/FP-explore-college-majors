4581081,5,B0055T3RSS,i just loved this movie from start to end. similar movies like' the departed' where the character plays a deep undercover assignment always interrested me. this story is about a guy who just been release from prison to help the police infiltrate a group of thieves. theres even a bit of fast and furious type scenes in this. loved the chracters and the edge of your seat action and chase scenes. and for the gamers reading this i also recommend playing 'sleeping dogs' game for a similar experience.,1345420800,3,499,4.681818181818182
4581082,5,B0055T3RSS,I recommend this movie it is awesome and action packed. You will be thrilled from beginning to the end!  This is truly a movie that is worth the money.  You will definately enjoy the movie.,1341705600,2,189,4.371428571428571
4581083,4,B0055T3RSS,"The Stool Pigeon is a well directed taut cop drama , with heavy emphasis on the characters that drive this thriller ,the flashbacks pieces together this story and make for some compelling action sequences thru out this film,there no redeeming characters in this film ,which was quite alright with me, this story was about an informant and the hell he goes thru ,because of his past. That's about all of the movie I will talk about! A suggestion is to seek out all of DANTE LAM'S action/crime drama's he's is the best out there right now in my opinion,this Director's movies get better with each one,also looking forward to viewing the Viral Factor in the near future his latest crime epic, Stool Pigeon is a solid entertaining crime film......peace",1330560000,,748,4.8062015503875966
4581084,4,B0055T3RSS,"Quite good acting and cinematography. Script and directing were well done but not on a par with the acting and filming. Some of the editing made following the storyline a bit more confusing than it needed to be and to that add a storyline that's a little too shallow at times particularly the different character subplots.

Informants and their interaction with police is the primary storyline whereas that story is customarily a secondary thought in crime genre movies. Heavily tragedy oriented, so be prepared.",1328054400,,512,5.095238095238095
4581085,4,B0055T3RSS,"A 2010 Hong Kong crime drama ""Stool Pigeon"" follows the story of a police detective Don Lee (Nick Cheung) and his newly recruited informant, an ex-convict Ghost (Nicholas Tse). Don wants to bring down the criminal gang led by notorious Barbarian (Lu Yi) who has returned from Taiwan, and to do so the detective uses Ghost, who infiltrates the criminal gang as a getaway driver.

Things get complicated when Ghost gets involved with Ah Di (Kwai Lun-mei), Barbarian's lover. And the detective, who strictly orders younger officers not to be emotionally attached to the informants, has some past he has to deal with.

If you are looking for big shoot-outs and car chases, perhaps you will be disappointed with ""Stool Pigeon,"" which is, like critically acclaimed ""Infernal Affairs,"" about the characters torn between the conflicting values. Yes, there are action scenes and they are competently done, but they rather serve to show how these characters, trying to run away from the past, get driven into corners. Sorry for my vague descriptions, but in short, this is a Hong Kong noir, where there is no easy way out.

Despite the several lulls, director Dante Lam keeps the tension throughout, with the excellent acting from Nick Cheung and Nicholas Tse. My complaint is that the film has too many subplots and flashbacks. Kwai Lun-mei's character needs more depth. The sentimental dancing class episodes are pretty incredible, even by the standards of crime suspense. With a simpler plotline ""Stool Pigeon"" could have been more thrilling and involving.",1325203200,6,1549,5.090551181102362
4581086,4,B0055T3RSS,"David Johnson, DVD Verdict --This is not a jam-packed actionfest import. The Stool Pigeon is more along the lines of something like The Departed, or more appropriately Infernal Affairs. This isn't quite up to the level of those two movies, but I have no qualms about offering a hearty recommendation to fans of hardboiled cop cinema.

Though the runtime is heavily concentrated on the characters, there is some action tossed in to spice things up. It's not glossy, high-octane stuff and mainly consists of a couple car chases and a botched heist job. However, the finale is engaging, a bloody, clumsy stab-a-thon in an abandoned school.

The Blu-ray delivers, providing a high-end 2.35:1/1080p treatment that pushes sharp clarity and clean picture fidelity throughout. There's a DVD version included as well, but opt for the sharp contrast of the HD. Sound: a clean DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track (Cantonese) and a dubbed 2.0 stereo English mix. Extras include deleted scenes, some making-of footage, and a hefty behind-the-scene featurette.

8458767,3,B0055T3RSS,"First, I should say the movie is awesome, well worth 5 stars - what I could watch of it!
It's the second point that's the problem. This was an All Regions (All Code) DVD when I ordered it from West Coast Film Buffs (fulfilled by Amazon), which should play on my computer because other All Regions DVDs play just fine for me. With The Stool Pigeon, however, I got about 2/3 of the way through the movie and the DVD locked up my DVD-viewing program which, in turn, locked up the rest of my computer. I couldn't even remove the DVD until I hard-booted!
This page says that the version for sale is Region 1. I would be VERY CAREFUL when ordering from the sellers listed for a new copy at this time (02 October 2016) because most of these DVDs originated in Hong Kong or that region. It would be wise to contact the seller from whom you are contemplating a purchase and confirm that their DVD is, in fact, Region 1. I suspect it is not.
Another thing I just noticed: This page does not say that the movie is subtitled or dubbed in English. If it is, it should say so. Something else I would ask of the seller you intend to use.",1475366400,,1122,4.199074074074074
