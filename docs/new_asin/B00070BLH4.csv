3704565,4,B00070BLH4,"This is an excellent example of the unusual unique talent of Victor Borge, a performer par excellence. it is a treat to watch him perform.",1392854400,,138,4.56
3704566,5,B00070BLH4,"Much of the material from Victor Borge are from past performances and mostly in black and white and not always the best picture. This production is high-quality and was produced with Borge celebrated his 80th birthday and clearly demonstrated at even at 80 years old, he still has the talent and abilities.

Not everything is comedy as Victor picks up the baton and conducts the orchestra and is accompanied by some great artists in their own right.

While this is the product of a record company, and limited to a CD length (80 minutes), it is a very good sampling of the entire broadcast.",1388448000,,590,4.663461538461538
3704567,5,B00070BLH4,Nothing better than the wonderful humor of the funniest man to have in your collection.  You will not regret the purchase,1386892800,,121,4.761904761904762
3704568,5,B00070BLH4,This is Victor Borge at his best.  If you are a Borge fan you will love it.  My girlfriend and I laughed all the way through it.,1367020800,,128,3.7037037037037037
3704569,4,B00070BLH4,You can't miss with Victor Borge. If you like his humor this is worth getting along with some of his other CDs.,1352851200,,111,4.090909090909091
3704570,5,B00070BLH4,"This was a unique party for Victor Borge's 80th birthday. It was a live event, recorded in a concert hall (so the quality isn't the best), but nothing really to complain about. This event took place in 1990.

My only complaint is that it had lots of special guests, and took the emphasis away from Borge. It's not like most of his other performances - but I suppose that's why many others really like this program.

I still give this a 5-star - Borge was a genius at both music and comedy. Borge loved performing live, and connecting with his audience - it didn't matter to him that he was making royalties from his CDs and videos. In fact, Borge gave away much of his money - in his lifetime, he set up trusts for families of Holocaust victims, and was involved in many other civic groups.

Borge performed up to 60 times a year, even at age 91 ... and he had even performed the night before he passed away. He had just returned home from a concert in Denmark, and passed away peacefully and quietly in his sleep.",1255824000,,1014,4.326315789473684
3704571,3,B00070BLH4,"He's hillarious.  5 stars.
He's extremely talented.  5 stars.
And he's kept most of his hair throughout the years.  4 stars.

The only issue I have is with the DVD itself.  I remember watching this on tv, ohhh, roughly 15 years ago.  We recorded it on VHS (that's a rectangular plastic device invented back in the stone ages for you younger kids).  There were routines he did as well as other performances that are not included with this dvd, which is really too bad.  For the first time ever I have bought a dvd that has less than what was shown on tv.",1251504000,,553,4.300970873786408
3704572,4,B00070BLH4,"You need to watch Victor Borge A few times in your life. The act remains pretty unchanged throughout his career, but was so brilliant the first time, that you need to watch it if you haven't before.

 I bought this because my son had not seen him before and watching it with him made me remember how fun it was. We laughed and laughed through the video.

  So in a nutshell, see it if you haven't before. You will love it, or better yet get it for someone you know hasn't seen it. It's a classic.",1234310400,,496,4.125
3704573,5,B00070BLH4,"aren't we lucky to be able to buy DVD's to keep memories fresh that we did have such wonderful artists and this is TERRIFIC with so many guest stars, and I have to be honest, I have shown this to many a friend at home
who is a bit depressed - Victor Borge cerrtainly manages to help one forget for a while our daily problems, and feel MUCH better for having had the privilege that such people existed!  Very highly recommendable!",1232150400,,429,4.296296296296297
3704574,5,B00070BLH4,"This is a well deserved tribute to

Victor Borge who is no longer with us.

Many of his jokes and stories presented are

known from previous recordings, what is new

is his great pianistics, which was quite often

overlooked and underestimated. There is more of it

on this disc. He remains very unique in his

attempts to combine great music pieces with

unparalelled humor and grace. Joy of life and

unusual sense of humor emanates from him

in every stage if his long life. This album is

a must for everyone who ejoyed his performances

3704575,1,B00070BLH4,"This delightful event is terribly marred by Borge Productions having produced this VHS tape at ""super long play"" speed --which runs wretchedly on our fine, 4 head, Panasonic tape deck. It takes a while for my machine to get a lock on tracking, the color is hyped, the image is grainy, and the sound sputters (on my VHS machine). I suggest you try to find a DVD version --or pay very little if there's no other version. (I can't believe they were trying to save a few pennies on the cost of a VHS cartridge. Maybe they thought it would be too crummy to be worth making illegal copies??)",1146700800,,585,4.376146788990826
3704576,5,B00070BLH4,"Can't get enough of him.  He's very entertaining and the good thing is his humor isn't vulgar whatsoever.  If you haven't seen his routine, then you need to.  Watch it over a couple times you might miss some of those subtle jokes.",1051574400,,230,4.428571428571429
8322800,5,B00070BLH4,This is great and very funny. Lot of good music as well.,1504051200,,56,3.75
8322801,3,B00070BLH4,"We loved Victor Borge!  I first saw this special on PBS back when it was first-run, and recorded it on VHS (which was not of the best quality).  But when we bought the DVD, we found out that it was incomplete; the beautiful patriotic medley by the Alexandria Harmonizers near the end of the program was cut out!  It's an affront not just to the country, but to Victor Borge himself, who remarked in his closing that they were ""wonderful songs"".  But on the DVD, you won't know what he was talking about.

If anyone ever releases a full version of this DVD, please let me know.  Until then, I'll have to put up with my VHS recording.",1489276800,,632,4.313559322033898

8322805,5,B00070BLH4,"I had taped this Birthday Gala from television in about 1991, and my tape just died.  So I replaced it with the DVD.  It shows the many sides of Victor Borge at his very best.  He's one of a kind, and this Birthday Gala is one of a kind.",1445558400,,237,3.795918367346939
8322806,5,B00070BLH4,"It is a wonderful program - I absolutely LOVE Victor Borge, and the Alexandria Harmonizers open this by singing Happy Birthday to Mr. Borge.  How can you go wrong??  I purchased this DVD as a birthday present for my husband, who also LOVES Victor Borge.  My husband and I watched this DVD on Weds evening after I gave it to him, and it is just as funny as we remember it to be when he used to watch it with his parents, and I watched it on PBS when it first aired.  As would be expected, this is a DVD made from an old program and Mr. Borge does have a rather green appearance at times.",1441929600,,586,4.025862068965517
