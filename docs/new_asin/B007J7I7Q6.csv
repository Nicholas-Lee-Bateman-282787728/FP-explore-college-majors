5090854,2,B007J7I7Q6,"Natasha (Natasha Rinis) travels to Mexico from Russia. She is taken into slavery and sold as a prostitute to NYC. The film consists of her van ride from Houston to NYC and her fight to break out of an Econoline. The purpose of the film is to bring attention to the problem of forced prostitution by making us watch a road trip.

Works as a drama if you like a bad Lifetime film.

5090856,5,B007J7I7Q6,This was a gift for my husband. I had checked around all over the place for it and found it!!! Awesome movie. Didn't realize that it was based on a true story as well. Very good in detail too. The ending wasn't as I expected though.,1376524800,,232,4.065217391304348
5090857,2,B007J7I7Q6,"I didn't really get into this movie. This movie is basically a movie about human trafficking and how it works for this one girl from Russia and the driver that takes her from Mexico to New York. There's a lot of violence and bad language. If you're expecting to see rape or sex, there's none of that here. There's little sexual references and that's as far as it goes. The ending is a good endding because, well, it's a movie. So, it's not very realistic, and I do NOT recommend this movie.",1361750400,3,490,4.336956521739131
5090858,4,B007J7I7Q6,"Natasha (Natasha Rinis) is a pretty young Russian woman who has had her way paid to come to America to become a model and an actress.  Unfortunately, when she arrives in Mexico, she discovers that she is just one of many girls from overseas who has been tricked into thinking a better life waits for her, and realizes that she is in the hands of ruthless pimps who plan to send her to New York where she is to become a stripper and prostitute.

On a two-day drive, she forms an unlikely bond with her Egyptian driver Sayed (Sayed Badreya), and their tumultuous relationship gives way to candid confessions and a respect for each other that turns the tables.

Thought provoking, emotional, and with a well written script, this movie never takes its main topic off the front burner.  You come to care for both Natasha and Sayed, and you end up rooting for them both.  I don't want to give the ending away, but it's not what you might expect.  The subject of international differences and what is likely to happen to most of these young women (let's also not forget children) is always at the foreground.  The unlikely compassion is welcome, and the awareness of this topic never gets old.  Check this movie out for yourself.  It's not to be missed.",1353110400,3,1246,4.551569506726457

5090877,4,B007J7I7Q6,"My copy of CARGO (2011) is on a PHASE 4 FILMS collection anonymously titled 8 HORROR FILMS.
Although there are horrible events in this psychological drama, it nowhere near qualifies as a
horror movie.

There's a few peripheral characters here, yet this is primarily a set piece for two.

With dreams of modeling in the U.S., a young Russian emigre named Natasha (Natasha Rinis)
tries to slip across the Mexican border by hiring a transporter who can get her a false passport.
It was all a ruse; Natasha is taken prisoner by these faux smugglers and sold to someone in NYC
as a sex slave. After being held is a dank basement for a while her journey under duress begins.

A powerful, quick-tempered Egyptian (Sayed Badreya) has to get Natasha to  New York
in two days, a trip the girl does everything she can to disrupt or escape from.
It is in this struggle of wills where ""Cargo"" has its most skin-crawling moments.

Once she calms down, Natasha finds ommunication is possible with her captor, who is a devout
Muslim, and although she's nowhere near freedom, there is some growing respect between them.

Perhaps a middling 5.2 IMDb rating (as of 11/15) is due to a predictable plot.
The story never drags, so as entertainment it's successful.",1446768000,2,1242,4.700460829493087
8518268,5,B007J7I7Q6,"Difficult to watch, not for entertainment. Based on real life of victims of human trafficking. The two main actors are pretty good, the 5 stars belong to them. The movie itself is worth 3 stars.",1528416000,,194,4.571428571428571
