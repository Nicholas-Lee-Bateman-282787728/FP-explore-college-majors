3953137,4,B002MXZYGI,"While I was a fan of the 1st set, it unfortunately was rather hit or miss, so I only rented it. This volume however is very much worth a purchase. There are still a few ""meh"" episodes but the humor is much more spot on in this DVD set and only gets funnier each episode. The English dub is again flawless for this set as in the 1st one, great acting and writing.",1262390400,,362,3.9726027397260273
3953138,4,B002MXZYGI,"Unique, fun and gut-bursting humor!  ""Sgt. Frog"" is probably one of the most odd and crazy anime series you'll ever see.  Hilarious in Japanese but the writing for the English dub definitely takes things up a notch!

Since 1999, the manga series ""Keroro Gunso"" (aka ""Sgt. Frog"")  by Mine Yoshizaki (""Arcade Gamer Fubuki"", ""Chibi Kero"" and ""Seven of Seven"") has been entertaining readers.  Since 2004, the anime series has been entertaining viewers and both continue to be popular long-running series in Japan.  Now the award winning series continues with its second part of the first season courtesy of FUNimation entertainment.

The anime series is directed by Yusuke Yamamoto (""Welcome to the NHK, ""Sakura Taisen"", ""Mobile Suit Victor Gundam"" and Arjuna"") and features character designs by Fumitoshi Oisaki (""Romeo x Juliet"", ""Ontama"" and ""Kaleido Star"").  The series is known for its use of parodies of pop culture and in the Japanese case, you will see a plenty of pop culture references to anime and video games.  While, the English dub features a slightly different script than the Japanese and utilizes American pop culture (which I will describe more in the video and audio segment of this review).

The series revolves around an alien race of frogs who have come to conquer the planet Earth.  But somehow along the way, things didn't go as expected and the leader of the platoon, Sergeant Frog finds himself living with the Hinata family.  In the first part of the series, we learn of how the frogs get to reunite with each other and now with the second part of the season, the frogs try to think up ways to take over the world.  Which the frogs find out for themselves of how difficult it will be.

""Sgt. Frog - Season One, Part 2' features a total of 12 episodes on two DVD's.  Each episode consists of two mini-episodes, most often at times are related to each other. but sometimes you get two different stories per episode.  Here is a spoiler-less summary:

DISC 3:

  * EPISODE 14-  The Silence of the Plans - Sgt. Kero orders his frogs to plant flowers for world domination.
  * EPISODE 15- The Dark Momoko Saga! - Momoko has joined the dark side and wants to help the platoon destroy the Earth.
  * EPISODE 16 - Twin at all Costs! - Why are there twin Angol Momoa's?
  * EPISODE 17 - Froggy Paddle! - Natsumi vs. Kero in a swimming challenge.  In the second story, the frogs and the gang tells scary stories.
  * EPISODE 18 - Wet Hot Beaches! - The Hinata family and the frogs go on a trip to a polluted beach and Natsumi takes part in a bikini competition.
  * EPISODE 19 - Keroro Killed the Radio Star! - The Hinata's attend a festival away from the platoon but find out that the frogs are disguising as human selling Kero merchandise.  In the second part, when Mutsumi talks about enjoying Gundam on radio, Natsumi starts building them.  This gives Kero an idea for world domination.
  * EPISODE 20 - 20,000 Leaps Under the Sea - The Hinata's and the gang go out to sea for a swim.  In the second part of the series, the gang go diving under the sea.

DISC 4:

  * EPISODE 21 - Some Like It Scorching and Miserable - A heatwave hits town and the group finds a way to keep cool.  In the second part of the series, the Hinata family take a trip to visit grandma (not knowing the frogs have joined them).
  * EPISODE 22 - Lose the Boss! - Kero is discharged from the platoon and Tamama becomes the new leader.
  * EPISODE 23 - The Clone wars (The Unsucky Version)! - Keroro tries to steal the Kero ball.
  * EPISODE 24 - Los Action Hero! -  Space Deputy Kogoro  comes to Earth to visit the platoon and find a job on Earth.
  * EPISODE 25 - A Justified War! - Momoka's father sends his forces to take Momoka but the platoon prepare to protect her by fighting the forces.
  * EPISODE 26 - Let the Games Impend! - Fuyuki must take part in a school competition and since Fuyuki is not athletic, the platoon tries to give him some help.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Sgt. Frog"" is presented in 4:3.  For the most part, the entertaining part of ""Sgt. Frog"" are its characters but also the little Japanese pop culture references, especially Keroro's love for ""Gundam"" (which the model kits are featured in the anime series).  The colors are vibrant and for a television show, the animation works great for this series.  Keroro and his members of the Armpit Platoon are frogs with a cool and cute character design, that it's no surprise that this series has an extensive merchandise collection in Japan.

As for audio, the English dub is featured in Dolby Surround Sound and the Japanese is featured in stereo.  For the most part, I have watched both in English and Japanese and the voice acting on both are great.  As for audio quality, I preferred to watch the series with my receiver setting at stereo on all channels but for the most part, the English dialogue is front and center channel driven if watched via 5.1 Dolby Surround.

Now when it comes to audio and watching it on both languages, there is a difference between the English and Japanese version.  For the most part, the English version has a rewritten script that utilizes the same storyline as the Japanese version but features American pop culture references and more dialogue.  So, for example, when the Japanese dialogue is quiet, in the English dialogue, you may hear the narrator speaking.

Although I tend to prefer watching anime in Japanese, I have to admit that I found the English dub quite wild and crazy.  The English dub tends to use quite a bit of references to American pop culture.  Granted, some people may not be familiar with the American pop culture references especially if you watch this anime several years later but overall, FUNimation has done a fun job of making this series more appealing to the American crowd.

Subtitles are featured in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Sgt. Frog - Season One, Part 2' continues the craziness and fun where the last volume left off!  I really don't think anyone can be disappointed with this DVD set as its absolutely fresh, wild and crazy.  As people are wanting to find a series that is fun and unique, I think that anime fans that are into comedy-based series can find something to like about ""Sgt. Frog"".

Having watched the episodes in Japanese and English, the Japanese version was hilarious but being an American and familiar with the pop culture references in the dialogue and the Japanese pop culture references on the show, I had a great time watching it with the English dub.  You can tell there was great care on the American side into utilizing the time of the series to create additional dialogue and of course, coming up with something new to make the characters much crazier for an American audience.

It's important to note that FUNimation Entertainment went with the original names for the dub, so for those who saw the test episode on YouTube and were not satisfied with the name changes, FUNimation Entertainment did fix that up with only Giroro's cat keeping the name ""Mr. Furbottom"" and the voice talent changed for the final cut.

As for the parents who are wondering if the show is safe for children, although the series is rated TV PG, there is no naughty talk or any profanity.

Overall, this is an anime series that is worth purchasing!  For those who enjoyed ""Crayon Shin Chan"" (US dialogue version) or where writers tend to experiment with American pop culture references, ""Sgt. Frog"" uses a similar style but is much tamer compared to Shin-chan but still hilarious.  One can definitely expect ""Sgt. Frog"" to be a series that has cool and fun characters and outrageously written episodes, definitely make this anime series worth the purchase!",1259452800,2,8243,4.6525658807212205
3953139,4,B002MXZYGI,"I'll fess up- the first volume of Sgt. Frog took me my surprise and that's saying a lot considering I pride myself on being quite jaded.  Here was a show that took some adorable Japanese animated material and basically retooled it in the English dub to become a barrage of pop culture inspired humor.  Kind of like what was done with Shin Chan, only less random and far more subdued.

Funimation has wasted very little time in getting this, the second part of the first season (Episodes 14-26) out to the North American public after a successful first-part release a little over a month prior. Coming in at a total runtime of 300 minutes, Sgt. Frog Season One Part 2 spans 2 discs and comes packaged as a pair of thin packs within a cardboard slipcase.

The show wears an appropriate if slightly conservative TV PG rating, which is presumably based more on adult-themed references and cartoony violence over nudity, foul language or gore.

Language options are typical sub & dub meaning the option of original Japanese dialog track (stereo) or an English dub (5.1 Dolby Surround) and English subtitles available under either language choice.

Extras include Pekopon Invasion Recon Data, textless songs and a host of Funimation trailers.

The story continues where the first part left off with misguided militant alien frog Keroro in a bit of a bind with orders to conquer the planet earth even though he's growing ever-more attached to its inhabitants.  This time he's got a five-man, er I mean five-frog platoon to keep him on track.  Even still the sarge manages to go and blow his allowance on Gundam models which means that the mission's financial backing is in big trouble.  Rather than buy into the invasion, the frogs find themselves seeking out a weakness within the human populous to exploit: Ghost stories, rigged bikini contests, a sabotaged field day, hey desperate times call for desperate measures.

The show, as was the case in the first release, works due to its wit far more effectively than it does a straightforward plot.  The grand mission is nearly constantly interrupted by moments of sheer zaniness but it's tough to fault the show for that.  In fact, it's the wackiness (coupled to some really slick dialog) that makes the show succeed.  Like before the real laughs here are nestled within the dialog.  The viewer needs to listen carefully as the jokes, puns, and zips come quick and constant.

I can't help but feel the first release was a bit tighter in terms of its sociological references but in keeping in mind that the writers are forced to work against visuals that are beyond their control, props are definitely due to the FUNimation team for maintaining the tone.

Again expect a virtual overload of cultural zingers (and even several mentions of one of my all time unsurpassed American animated series, Exosquad).
In all, the outrageous English script warrants the continued devotion to this series.  Even on those gray days when the rain's falling and all the bills are due, it's tough to come away from this one without cracking up at something.  And on the brighter days, prepare to be cracking up at everything!",1258848000,2,3149,4.8414179104477615

8374259,5,B002MXZYGI,"When I first heard about this show I was skeptical, Alien Frogs?? But I gave the first episode a go and was instantly hooked and the best part I could share it with my children. My son adores this show and has watched seasons 1 & 2 about 5 times now. Funimation did an outstanding job with this anime and the voice actors were amazing. You have Todd Haberkorn, Brina Palencia, Chris Sabat, Chuck Huber and J.Michael Tatum as the invading frogs bent on world domination, the problem they not only underestimate the Pekoponians (humans) they just constantly get into trouble. It is one hilarious act after another, with a wide variety of pop culture references thrown in. I've recommended this series to my friends that watch anime and they've all loved it.",1300665600,,755,4.684210526315789
