8086035,5,B000BF0CQG,"I teach hospitality classes at a local community college and during our time on accommodations, show this video to the students as extra ""knowledge."" Much better visually than verbally. The video has a good pace. It is not boring and combines some of our past history such as Great Depression and Cuba. My students really enjoy watching this and the video creates a lot of feedback from them. You can tell when a class likes the video, they talk about it over and over again.",1391644800,,475,4.6
8086036,1,B000BF0CQG,I teach locally at the community college and wanted this autobiography of Conrad Hilton to complete my founding fathers in hospitality selections. It took longer than usual to be delivered from a third party. The DVD did not work. It was a blank tape. Amazon.com rectified this sale immediately and sent me another bio of Hilton from another seller. Be careful when buying DVD's from third parties.,1377302400,,398,4.955223880597015
8086037,4,B000BF0CQG,"The name ""Hilton"" may have been somewhat devalued in the past ten years, which was caused by the antics of great--granddaughter Paris and the sale of the entire brand and company to a venture capital group.  Regardless of these actions which occurred well after the founder's death, this Biography is rather well done.

Conrad Hilton was born in the 19th century to parents who greatly influenced his life.  His mother instilled a sense of commitment to values and organized religion (Catholicism) and his father provided his son with an inner drive to success.

This biography may whitewash some of Hilton's personal shortcomings, but it does clearly outline Hilton's initial failures in the public realm as a legislator, banker, retail operator and oilman.  It shows his commitments to his guests and suppliers in the early days of the Depression, when he maintained his strong feeling not to declare bankruptcy as a means to solve his liquidity problems, which was the action taken by almost all of his competitors. The video demonstrates that it was this position that eventually gave Hilton the lead in the years following the Depression and WWII when the country was rebuilding.

I found his values and continuing drive to try new venues to be a fresh perspective in the current economic environment.

8086038,2,B000BF0CQG,"A&E Biography has several episodes that deal with ""B-list"" famous people.  It's a bit harder to watch them than say works about Abe Lincoln, Gandhi, or Marie Antoinette.  Still, if you want to learn about the life of an incredibly rich and successful person, then here you go.  This man seemed like a pre-Donald Trump.  He looked far younger than he was, as did his sons, and he seemed to have worked long after most Americans have retired.

This work does not just talk about the positives.  One learns that he failed at many ventures before putting up his hotels.  He was divorced twice during an era when that was taboo.  I loved learning that, like Robert Redford and Billy Bean, he grew up around Latinos and was thus bilingual.  This documentary has a political edge as his hotel was taken over by Castro after he seized power in Cuba.

I am constantly lambasting ""Biography"" for watering down the progressive leanings of famous people.  However, here they show Mr. Hilton with Nixon and Ike but never once label him a Republican.  Maybe they avoid the right as well as the left.

FOR MODERN VIEWERS, PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS PARIS HILTON'S GREAT-GRANDFATHER.  This work was made in 1996, before she stuck her face, and other body parts, all over the media and specializing in being a hot mess.  On the one hand, her great-grandfather advocated prayer and was a dedicated Catholic, but on the other, he liked to be seen with beautiful ladies.  So it is unclear what he would have thought about Paris and her shenanigans.  Further, he had a son who lived the fast life before he prematurely died.  Paris' grandfather is interviewed, but he just praises his father, rather than speaking of himself or his progeny.",1157155200,6,1717,4.68561872909699
