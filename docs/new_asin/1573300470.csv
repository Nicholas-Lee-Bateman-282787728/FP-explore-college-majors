191809,3,1573300470,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching The Making of Pump.  It is a fascinating look into the inner workings of a band in the process of putting together what would become a landmark album.  On the other hand, I couldn't help but see some striking resemblances to This Is Spinal Tap...from arguments over the title of the album, to debates over which lyrics might to too risque for Top 40 radio.  But then what else can you expect from a band that specializes in rock-n-roll lunacy like Aerosmith?",988588800,,488,4.651162790697675
191810,5,1573300470,"I'm a little confused as to what some of the reviewers of this title are complaining about.  This is not supposed to be a music video compilation, it's about the making of an album.  This disc offers a rare opportunity to glimpse behind the scenes at just ""What It Takes"" to put together a great album.  I, for one, have seen this one at least a dozen times and I find something new in it everytime I watch.  I would most definitely recommend this title to any true fan of the band, get it now!",983836800,3,494,4.168421052631579
191811,1,1573300470,"This ranks up there with some of the other major disappointments and ""cashing-in"" copouts.(Chilli peppers - Funky Monks, Alanis -Jagged little pill, Motley Crue ETC). Seems like labels think they can  just put out any old junk and the public will buy. At least with Aerosmith  they have been good enough to tell you in the title that what you are  really gonna get here is a whole bunch of poor quality out-takes about the  band. I am a HUGE Aerosmith fan, however not even I can say I will watch  this more than once.",960163200,4,518,4.410526315789474
191812,1,1573300470,A disappointing purchase - very little music of low quality. For committed fans only,944438400,,84,5.071428571428571
191813,4,1573300470,"Well to start off I thought it was pretty good. They showed a lot of what it takes to make an ulbum. I saw things in there that you would have never have thought of about making an ulbum. They also have some cuts of when  they were making the music videos too.
  All around this DVD is a very  good buy for anyone who likes Aerosmith. They are the best Rock band ever.  Besides The Beatles and The Stones!",943747200,2,405,4.0125
191814,5,1573300470,I thought that this was a great video. I have always been a real Aerosmith fan. My son will be 20 years old in August and his name is Steven Tyler Cozad. So it was great to see them back on top were they have always been  to me. The song What it takes is one of my favorites of all time.,921628800,2,287,3.629032258064516
191825,5,1573300470,I pick a lot of my DVD to get a look at what goes on behind the scenes and in what it takes to get the music from inside their heads and then on  a CD or a DVD.,1356480000,,160,3.1025641025641026
191826,3,1573300470,"The video was just OK. It is fair rock doc and although it was sold as a DVD, none of the 3 DVD players on our home could play it. It had to be played on my computer. It's nice to see the band during a peak period so for that reason I would still recommend it.",1350864000,,260,3.5789473684210527
191827,5,1573300470,If you're a huge Aerosmith fan or like learning about great rock bands then I highly recommend this DVD!  Aerosmith is my favorite band of all time.  This DVD has 2 sides.  I loved learning about how much time goes into making an album and how they come up with songs.  I'll definitely be buying other Aerosmith DVD's and learning more about them since they haven't been on Vh1's Behind The Music in forever.  I highly recommend buying this.  It's definitely worth your time and money.,1350432000,,485,4.5813953488372094
191828,5,1573300470,"I've owned this DVD since my college days and even today, 10+ years later, it's still an enjoyable film to watch.

Regarding content, the director's approach to the film leaves both the seasoned Aerosmith fan and the newcomer equally satisfied.  Personally, I am also a huge fan of Steven Tyler (outside of Aerosmith), so I was especially pleased to see how much he contributed to this film, by way of interviews and ""in-scene"" documentary-style action.

Thankfully, however, the film does not focus on Steven Tyler as if he was the only guy in the band!  The director does an excellent job of recognizing that Joe Perry and the rest of the gang contribute a significant amount to each and every song--songs that make the great records that Aerosmith has been responsible for in the last few decades. Joe Perry really comes off as a gifted artist in his own right- and I'm glad he was portrayed as such.  I can say the same for the other band members, too.

One thing that was particularly fascinating about this documentary is that the ""in-action"" scenes (non interview, non scripted) actually do seem to be authentic and off-the-cuff!!  I've seen way too many so called ""making of"" documentaries that seem like they were filmed entirely after the fact- and quite frankly, that's a bummer.  'The Making Of Pump' contains so much raw footage of the band jamming, putting songs together (songs that would later be hits!), and laughing/arguing/discussing and working....that I really did feel like I was there as it was happening rather than watching a bunch of guys sharing vague recollections about something they had done years earlier.

If I remember correctly, there are a few moments when S.T. mentions songs from this album that are ""now big hits""- of which I must conclude that at least a percentage of the interviews were done after the completion of the album...But truly,the only 'retrospective' analysis comes during those interviews- other than that, it really is an 'as it's happening' kind of doc.

Wish they made on of these for every album made by all of my favorite artists!  I'd be in heaven!",1346544000,,2109,4.846796657381615
191829,5,1573300470,"Pump is one of my favorite Aerosmith albums, and this video did not dissapoint. You get to see some raw footage inside the studio and watch the songs on the album come to life. Being able to see the songs in their infancy and see all the discussion, arguing, trial and error, and hard work that goes into the finsihed product was amazing. It gives you a new respect for the talent and creativity of all the band members. If you do not consider yourself a serious Aerosmith fan, this is not a video for you. It is not a concert, compilation of music videos, or history of the band. It is simply the making of pump, and something a true Aerosmith fan will enjoy.",1309737600,2,660,4.288
191830,5,1573300470,"There are very few videos of Aerosmith, but this one is awesome! The video shows the band making their pump album. It includes interviews of the band members, as well as video of the band rehearsing. The video and sound quality are really good. This is definitely one of the best Aerosmith videos available. I love it and would recommend it to anyone! A must-have for any Aerosmith fan!!",1305849600,,387,4.6231884057971016
191831,5,1573300470,"I bought this because I am a HUGE Aerosmith fan and I love watching footage of the band like this. For only $10, it's a great buy. You really learn a lot about how much time and effort went into making Pump. I'm an aspiring musician and I found this even better because it opened my eyes on what it takes to make a great album. For everyday people, this is a great insight into the world of production and recording. Even if you're not an Aerosmith fan, you should still enjoy it. There's some really funny scenes of the band and some good quotes and philosophy lessons, too. I love it!",1302825600,,586,4.241071428571429
191832,5,1573300470,Just received this dvd and after viewing I have to say I thought it was terrific . Reminded me of Rhino records classic album dvd series . Great in depth look at the creative process and band interaction of a wicked group with very little insight released in quality(and quantity)on dvd. Obviousely I highly recommend this dvd for any Aerosmith fan esp. if you were 18 like I was when PUMP came out lol ! Cheers,1297641600,,411,4.421052631578948
191833,5,1573300470,"Very entertaining, very insightful, i loved every minute of it!  Every true aerosmith fan should have a copy, you'll love it too!",1266710400,,129,4.863636363636363
191834,5,1573300470,"Dude, this is so cool, and really awesome for any Aerosmith fan. It takes you to the recording studio with the guys and you see them fight and you see them get it right. It also includes ""The Other Side"" Music video and What It Takes, it is a must have for any Aerosmith rocker!!!",1244592000,,280,4.109090909090909
191845,5,1573300470,"This movie is great but it doesn't begin with Joe Perry going to the restroom. It starts with ""Love in an Elevator."" It contains tons of great interviews with the band. The reason for the name ""Pump."" Shows the band aruging and the real great rawness of the band Aerosmith. It is not just one of those movies you watch and then put away in a corner. Every true member of the 'blue jean army' (See ""Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith"") should own this. I love it.",1207008000,,473,4.325842696629214
191846,1,1573300470,"This dvd is a complete waste of time. It says ""110 minutes of footage..."" and it turns out it's only 50 minutes of footage with the rest on the cutting room floor. I wasted 50 minutes of my life watching this, whereupon I ejected it from my dvd player muttering and cursing and promptly returned it for a refund. What's worse is I bought it as a gift for someone else. Gone is a significant portion of the film, including most of the songwriting process, interview fragments, and (the best) some of the arguments and studio drama. Anybody who watched this way back when would sympathize, and I can't believe I'm the first reviewer to recognize this dvd's complete inferiority and to tell it like it is: a total piece of JUNK!",1197676800,,725,4.5
191847,3,1573300470,For die hard Aerosmith fans. Interesting seeing the dynamic of the band recording Pump. The interview are okay though unabashedly stagged. Video quality in the studio is not great. The weirdest thing is how abruptly the DVD ends almost like a mistake. Nowhere near as much fun as You Gotta Move.,1189209600,,295,4.803921568627451
191848,5,1573300470,The Making of Pump talks about all the things that could have broken up Aerosmith.  Thankfully the band was able to rise above the problems that could have ended their career so badly and managed to release an excellent album called Pump.  Aerosmith truly is one of the greatest comeback stories in the history of rock and roll.  Pick this up to see why.,1161993600,,354,4.5
191849,5,1573300470,"I loved this DVD.  I enjoyed the behind the scenes look at the music business.  I also enjoyed the look at the personalites of the band members that you don't get from stage performances or videos.  This is a ""getting to know you"" kind of video.  Unless you are interested in the band members themselves, or in the business of music, you probably won't get much out of it, however.",1122854400,,381,4.4
191850,5,1573300470,"This DVD was exactly what I had hoped for. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't want a DVD of their video catalog.  Although videos are great, they are ""performance pieces"" and you can catch those any time you want on MTV.  This DVD brings you inside the studio .. and, in truth, inside the very creative minds of the members of the band.  You get to see exactly what process they go thru to create their masterpieces.  The DVD includes moments of brilliance, frustration, friendship, anger and sheer joy at realizing that their project is complete.  All five members of the band are showcased and it becomes clear how each one is vital to the survival of the group as a whole.  They candidly discuss their years of ""drinking and drugging"" .. and the lessons that they learned from it along the way.  Being a musician myself, I was fascinated with the recording process and the methods the band-mates utilize to achieve a finished product.  You get to hear the (now famous) hits in their infancy stages -- different lyrics, different music, etc. -- and the steps that were taken along the way to create the songs as we now know them.  You see the anguish the guys go through when one of their songs is cut from an album.  As Joe Perry puts it .. ""these songs are their babies and somebody else gets to decide which of them will grow up .. and which ones won't"".
Unlike the theatrical quality that you see in a produced music video, this DVD shows you the guys as they REALLY are.  It even opens by hearing Joe Perry urinating in the toilet while he is talking to Steven about a song they are working on.  It is clear that this is just an ""ordinary"" recording day for the guys.  No stage make-up, no theatrics for the camera .. just the intricate thought process that goes into creating a work of art.
As a bonus, you do get to see two ""finished"" numbers .. ""Love in an Elevator"" and ""The Other Side"" and you appreciate them so much more having seen how every note was laid down -- all the way down to the background speaking noises for their videos or ""opening clips"" before songs.
Before I saw this DVD, I was a huge Aerosmith fan ... but I really only knew background info on the two ""stars"" .. Steven and Joe Perry.  I was very pleased to get to learn more about the other three members of the band and how they all contribute to the workings of the ""machine"".
I highly recommend this DVD to anybody who is interested in HOW the songs are created.  From humming and knee-slapping (pre-lyrics) to the glorious finished products that we have come to recognize as true masterpieces of music.",1080604800,23,2587,4.416842105263158
191851,2,1573300470,"not bad in terms of seeing the bad boys of boston behind the scenes in the studio but bad in terms of dvd entertainment - no special features, no menu, there isn't even any artwork on the disc.
I think I speak on behalf of most Aerosmith fans when I say that the record company needs to release an Aerosmith concert on DVD for us. They must be the only band in the world that don't have a live concert to buy whenever you walk into a virgin megastore or a wallmart! It's frustrating! They should have even released an ""OH YEAH! GREATEST VIDEO HITS"" to coincide with the CD & the dvd could have had special features to make up for the songs without videos - for example big ten inch live, dream on live, etc. Surely this would have been more exciting to us fans than this!!
No wonder Aerosmith don't get the recognition they deserve if you cant even buy a concert or video compilation on DVD.",1080518400,13,891,4.247058823529412
191852,5,1573300470,"In this dvd you can see the 6 month working of one of the most geratest albums of Aerosmith-""Pump"". you can see how they make the songs,and come up the lyrics (steven's job...) And the cover.and bitween there are interviews with the 5 members. There are also the videos for ""The other side"" and a nice one of ""What it takes"".so if you're aerosmith fan or even just a music fan,Buy this dvd to see how albums make life...Rock on and AEROSMITH FOREVER!!.",1034812800,5,452,4.457831325301205
191853,5,1573300470,"I really didn't know exactly what to expect from this DVD, but I went for it as I am a long time (yep, I'm old!)fan of the band. I guess my interest for the band resurfaced after my visit to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame last spring. Started thinking about college and Boston and what a damn good time I had and Aerosmith was part of all that...ANYWAY,
I can't say that I really spend a lot of time watching movies or tv, but now, whenever I have downtime (usually between 10:30 p.m. and 1 a.m. weeknites...), I watch this DVD! It never fails to put me to bed in a good mood...pleasant dreams... ahem ! ANYWAY, this DVD is so great...I love the behind the scenes stuff and actually could have done w/less of the interviews, and just more candid stuff. (Camera person wasted a lot of time on blank space during the interviews... personally, don't want to see the walls, but the guys...)
I like the fact that there are only a couple of videos included...I didn't buy it expecting to see them, but rather, just as the title implies, the making of an album.
I was disappointed that there isn't much info or a booklet included and I admit that it took me a little while to figure out that you actually have to turn the DVD over to get to side 2...
I love this DVD. I love Aerosmith - even more so now.",1016064000,7,1295,4.184
191854,5,1573300470,"MAKING OF PUMP...A prime example of perfection and why most musicians today don't belong in the same room with these guys, period.
It is, by far, the best Aerosmith DVD/VHS I've seen to date.  I am an Aerosmith/Steven Tyler fanatic, to say the least, and I absolutely love this little masterpiece.
Each member is interviewed extensively, in and out of the studio.  Showing their personal interractions with each other during the making of this album was priceless.
Steven is, by far, the hardest working, most talented -- leading man in music; and Joe Perry, who is equally talented and second to NO ONE, is the epitome of cool.  That man should own the patent on leather pants and ripped denim, good god !!  As far as I am concerned, they both should STILL be referred to as the ""Toxic Twins"", since these two guys are intoxicating not to themselves, thank goodness for that, but to US!!!!
This is my favorite in my Aero-library and a true gem to behold.
Don't even hesitate.....buy it and watch it over and over and over again.
These guys are not referred as America's Greatest Rock Band for nothing.",1011225600,3,1102,4.664948453608248

7798164,5,1573300470,"The longest continual stay in a recording studio for the band was at Rik Tinory Productions in Cohasset, Massachusetts beginning in 1988. The entire band worked on the Grammy winning album ""Pump"" 11 hours a day for 18 months, each and  every  song was truly amazing in composition and feeling , Steven Tyler said to studio owner, ""Rik we are going to get 4 singles out of this album"" Steven was so right, ""Pump"" generated Rock History .

Aerosmith again returned to the Cohasset studio for another 9 months to create a followup album also enormous ""Get A Grip"" at that time the ""Simpsons"" came to Cohasset to record Aerosmiths first apearance  on the ""Simpsons "" show.  MTV erected a huge tent on the studio grounds for a Harley Davidson  giveaway and gave away Harleys to contestent winners.

Long live Aerosmith, the love, the joy, the music they have given to so many millions throughout the world and continue to give."" The Making Of Pump"" DVD is a natural true documentary and highly recomended.
