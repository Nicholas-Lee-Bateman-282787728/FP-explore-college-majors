8259358,2,B0015OMAOE,"I ordered this DVD mainly because Kristy looks so good on the cover.  I'm sure she didn't get to look the way she does by doing these workouts.  There is no creativity here and the exercises are extremely monotonous.  The lunge workout is 4 minutes of lunges on one leg, in a stationary position (meaning your feet don't move).  You hold the lunge, you do triple dips, slow and fast, but still 8 total minutes of just moving up and down.  The inner thight and upper body are pretty much the same - very ordinary moves.  Kristy is also not motivating.  She doesn't chat much, pretty much just says ""up and down"" over and over again.  My muscles were tired at the end, but I didn't work up a sweat and I'd rather do some really strenuous workouts for a shorter period than the highly repetitive ones on this DVD.

Some specific things I missed:  no countdown timer, I went through the DVD to figure out how long each set was; no cool down - just a warm up; the background is plain white, no visual interest.

Pretty boring all in all.

I just finished the Chalean Extreme and this was very disappointing compared to that one.",1280102400,,1123,4.371980676328502
