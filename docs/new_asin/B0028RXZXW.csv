He's made something beautiful out of these miserable little pieces of film, and I think its nothing short of heroic. ""Bus Nut"" can't play in my house with out someone laughing until they hurt themselves. We will be collecting the rest of the series, for sure.",1313971200,,392,4.458333333333333
8356739,5,B0028RXZXW,"Josh Way is funnier than you and I will ever be. Taking the seemingly endless streams of boring old educational films and turning them into comedy gold is no mean feat - with deadpan delivery and an eye for the absurd, he manages the seemingly impossible - actually improving upon the near perfect framework of the guys from MST3K and Rifftrax. Any of the volumes are exceptional value for money, there's nary a dud amongst them and you can tell this guy does it for the love of it.",1294704000,,482,4.426966292134831
