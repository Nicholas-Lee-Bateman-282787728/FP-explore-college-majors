8742676,4,B018PPLBPY,"I love the movie The Daughters of Joshua Cabe with Buddy Ebsen, Karen Valentine & Lesley Anne Warren. Bought the set only for this movie, so haven't seen the other films. The original film stock used could have benefitted from a bit of digital magic, but still very watchable. Good sound quality, too. Look for a young William Katt in a supporting role.",1506816000,,353,4.619047619047619
