8171668,5,B000MT3LO6,"Two movies in one? Always a great deal and I love both movies. The original Joy Ride is twice as better than it's sequel and Swimfan, well it is pretty much a teen version of Fatal Attraction and could of cast better for the leads girlfriend, could have even cast better for the stalker girl but she was alright.",1439510400,,312,4.305084745762712
8171669,5,B000MT3LO6,Joy Ride has always been one of my favorite movies and so has Swimfan. So I think it was a great idea for Fox to put these two movies together. I also appreciate that they have both of the separate DVDs instead of putting both of the movies on the same DVD leaving out the special features. All in all two great movies in one package great for anyone who loves both these movies.,1388620800,,379,4.135135135135135
8171670,1,B000MT3LO6,I love amazon but this was the worst purchase ever.  Only one movie arrived in the case.  I was supposed to get Joyride and Swimfan but I only received Joyride.  Swimfan was the movie I really wanted.  The case was dirty.  The best thing I can say was that it arrived on time. I have seen both movies before and they are awesome but next time I will buy movies from Walmart or best buy,1354665600,2,385,4.08
