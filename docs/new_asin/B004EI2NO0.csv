4337451,3,B004EI2NO0,Many of the same impressions. I can understand why the series didn't last. Charlotte Rae [pre-Diff'rent Strokes & Facts of Life] was great.,1361664000,,139,5.086956521739131
4337452,5,B004EI2NO0,"One of my favorite entertainers and finding this DVD was
a rare and unexpected pleasure.  Rich Little just as I remember him.",1361491200,,125,4.681818181818182
4337453,4,B004EI2NO0,"As a person who could of watched the Rich Little Show when it originally aired and did not. I have to wonder what I was watching instead. The guest stars are a who's who of popular TV actors of the day. The show is warm & funny. Rich has always been the best impressionist. Of course if you're too young you may not understand who Rich is pretending to be. If you were around at the time this show originally aired (1975-1976, NBC-TV) I think it will be a fun trip down memory lane.",1330041600,8,482,4.138297872340425
4337454,2,B004EI2NO0,"Rich Little was a fabulous imitator of voices but I guess I had never seen his shows.  Looking now, they were very weak.  Do not know why anyone thought he could carry a variety show. Anyone want to buy my copy?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rich-Little-Show-Complete-Series/dp/B004EI2NO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rich Little Show: Complete Series</a>",1319155200,2,392,7.145833333333333
4337455,3,B004EI2NO0,"It's enjoyable, no doubt. Not hillarious, yet very amusing. Rich Little himself - very talented, each and every guest star seems to give it all out and won't take himself too seriously, and every one of the 50 minutes just seem to fly by.

The problem starts when you watch a show a day: I wasn't an american citizen in that era, but to those who were -  did someone really need to hear Nixon/Ford/Humphrey/Carter impersonations on EVERY ONE of the shows?

I was pleasantly surprised to find English subtitles here, yet they were quite loaded with either hearing or listening errors.",1315180800,3,583,4.696078431372549
4337456,5,B004EI2NO0,"This was a wonderful show. but did anyone notice on the episode with Tom Bosley that Sherman Hemlsey was suppose to appear? Maybe my disc skipped over his part. but i never saw him. I was looking forward to seeing him.
Other than that i love the show. Still worth a look. Rich is wonderful with all the impressens.and price isn't bad either.",1312243200,3,341,4.428571428571429
4337457,5,B004EI2NO0,"If you're a Rich Little fan but you've never seen this show, you should!  Thanks to studios digging into their vaults, we're seeing shows, like this one, on DVD which haven't been seen in 30 to 40 years.

Excellent video and audio quality too, by the way.",1309132800,18,255,4.404255319148936
4337458,5,B004EI2NO0,"I recently bought this and I am very happy with it.  Rich Little is very funny and his guest stars are great.  If you are a fan of the 70's like me, you'll love this.",1305072000,12,166,3.7142857142857144
4337459,4,B004EI2NO0,"Known as America's greatest impressionist and a regular on the classic Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts, the legendary Rich Little is a genius at altering his voice to mimic such icons as John Wayne, Ronald Reagan, Johnny Carson, Jack Benny, Groucho Marx and dozens more.

On THE RICH LITTLE SHOW (1975-1976, NBC-TV), the comic great presents some of the most hilarious sketches in variety show history. Joining Rich is a parade of television and music stars such as Andy Griffith, Bill Cosby, Ron Howard, Susan St. James, Michael Landon, Bob Hope, Freddie Prinze, William Conrad, Bing Crosby, The Hudson Brothers, Bernadette Peters, Chad Everett, Sandy Duncan, Mel Torme, Starsky & Hutch stars David Soul and Paul Michael-Glaser, plus series regular Charlotte Rae (The Facts Of Life).

Highlights include parodies of '70s TV favorites Columbo, Happy Days and Welcome Back Kotter (with Michael Jackson), Rich playing Peter Sellers' infamous Inspector Clouseau, Charlotte Rae as a shoe-store customer with a foot fetish, Sherman Hemsley (The Jeffersons) as the Soul Fairy, Bill Bixby (The Incredible Hulk) as a bionic husband, Rich and Betty White portraying the President and First Lady, and a parody of The Hollywood Squares with original host Peter Marshall.

Among the hit song performances are Rhinestone Cowboy by Glen Campbell, Boogie Fever by The Sylvers, Junk Food Junkie by Larry Groce, Convoy by C.W. McCall and Forever Came Today by The Jackson Five.

4337470,4,B004EI2NO0,like old tv shows and with him in the leading role makes it interesting to see the old impressionists strut their stuff for the newer generation to view and appreciate and learn to do for the new generation of leaders and changers-funny too!!,1423958400,,242,4.651162790697675
4337471,3,B004EI2NO0,"Great DVD set, with all the shows, uncut.  Picture and sound quality are top notch for a show from that era.

Also includes some solid extras: interview with Rich Little and outtakes from some of his appearances.

The show itself is a fairly funny 70s-era variety show, not the best, but still entertaining.  Best to watch one episode, every couple of days.

Rich Little's impersonations are worth the price, but a galaxy of guest stars help seal the deal.",1421971200,,456,4.7215189873417724
4337472,4,B004EI2NO0,"While some of the 70s variety show is obviously dated, it is actually better than most of today's TV (2010s). The memories are welcome and the low budget shows, but there is a determined effort here to put together a good program.  Be sure to view the extras as they are fine and Rich's remembrances and what he thinks of today's entertainment is insightful.  This is a hot-or-miss, but when it hits, you'll be glad you have it. Gentle humor for all, great support from regular Charlotte Rae. We could do with a bit less of some impersonations, as Little agrees later, such as of Gerald Ford and Inspector Clouseau. The musical numbers and musical guests really are pretty good.",1416787200,4,678,4.641666666666667

4337476,4,B004EI2NO0,"I enjoyed the refreshing comedy.  I don't remember seeing his show, but remember his being a guest on others' shows.  It's nice to see his guests, as well as his funny skits and impersonations.",1388880000,,193,4.647058823529412
