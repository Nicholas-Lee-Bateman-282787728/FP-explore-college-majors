8114566,4,B000EUMMJ8,"This DVD set is from Tijuana's WWA(not WWO) promotion's tv show around 2003. It still includes the between match introductions, interviews and the like but even if you are fluent in spanish you will likeley find yourselve hiting the next chapter button as soon as those apear as the narrators are quite boring(BTW, No english comentary for anyone wondering if it packed both)...

The quality of most matches is really good, it combines well known luchadores and local talent of TJ, giving a good oversigth of the old school guard and the guys on the rise at the time.

8114567,4,B000EUMMJ8,"This DVD was not a bad purchase for the price that I paid for it.  Many matches are alright, but there are enough good matches to keep you entertained.

The DVD seems to be a documentation of the rivalry between one of the ""La Parka"" characters and his rivalries with ""El Hijo del Santo"".  That in itself is enough to pay the small price for it.

However, I did not like how they referred to him as his Dad's name ""El Santo"".  But all in all, it was still a good DVD for the price, filled with lucha antics and plenty of high spots.

The DVD even features matches with the unmasked Rey Mysterio, Jr., during the transitional period between WCW and WWE....

If you're a fan of lucha, you need this in your DVD library...",1179273600,2,719,4.242647058823529
