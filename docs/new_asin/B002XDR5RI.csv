8383601,5,B002XDR5RI,I'm a Steve Cochran fan and saw this film on TCM. Really enjoyed this Civil War action/drama. The DVD is produced when ordered. It was of good quality. I recommend it.,1484784000,,167,4.419354838709677
8383602,3,B002XDR5RI,OK......,1455408000,,8,8.0
8383603,2,B002XDR5RI,We were very disappointed with the film. It does not portray the actual historical account of the raid on Lawrence. For an accurate depiction here is an excellent book to read. http://www.amazon.com/Quantrill-at-Lawrence-Untold-Story/dp/1589809092/,1448755200,,248,6.78125
8383604,2,B002XDR5RI,Almost no historical fact.  50's Hollywood trash.  Don't waste your time on it.  I didn't like it.  Thak you too.,1377302400,,113,4.5
8383605,3,B002XDR5RI,"Certainly not one of the best westerns or accurate portrayal of Quantrill (when is someone going to get this story right?), but enjoyable enough for a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The characters are pretty thin but the action is entertaining and there's even some (unintentional, I'm sure) humor here.  Not bad but don't spend too much money on this one.",1374710400,,352,4.9491525423728815
8383606,2,B002XDR5RI,Not very factural but most folks who don't know the true history would still enjoy it.  Quantrill was caught and hung in Kentucky far from what the movie suggests.,1360195200,,163,4.620689655172414
8383607,4,B002XDR5RI,"This is as good as any solid western of the '50's. Leo Gordon, one of the scariest bad guys from many westerns, plays Quantrill who wants revenge on Lawrence, Kansas for kicking him out of town years ago. Steve Cochran, a Confederate spy, comes to town to help him but develops second thoughts along with affection for the girl, a boy, and the townspeople. It may not be historically accurate but the ending satisfies. Cochran is good; he should have had more starring roles.

The cinematography is excellent. There aren't really any vast western vistas and it looks like many westerns were filmed around these parts. On the other hand, the placement of the camera and composition of the shots makes it look totally fresh and exciting. A job well done. And there are lots of scenes outside of town, enough to even satisfy me.

And it has Leo Gordon.",1297641600,4,849,4.653333333333333
