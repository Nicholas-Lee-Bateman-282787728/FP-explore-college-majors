8296192,4,B001E38PMM,"A lovely little film of 1987. As dialogue between the main actors is not allowed here, you see a lot of mimicking and gesturing. This doesn't feel very unnatural, because some exchanges go through window glass or across a courtyard. Then there is a lot of silent musing and exploring. Kamal Hassan and the young, beautiful, yet down-to-earth Amala certainly bring a big spectrum of facial expressions and non-verbal entertainment to the screen - aided by a plot with love and attempted murder, apart from a lot of physical comedy.

There are other silent actors worth a watch too, including Tinnu Anand as a hapless contract killer and Farida Jalal as the love interest's resolute mother. Pushpak even provides an entertaining, smiling magician, played by a real magician.

There is a lot of background noise, and sometimes background dialogue can be heard distortedly. Once the main characters go to the movies, we hear clear, undistorted dialogue from the screen; I read that the language of this dialogue changed depending on the Indian state in which Pushpak was screened. We hear a lot of poignant, gimmicky, funny background music which - just like the characters - isn't traditionally Indian at all. There's just too much of this background bling-blang-blong, and not always does it fit into the scene.

At a length of 131 minutes, Pushpak is not even long by Hindi film standards. Still the concept of a silent movie with background music wears thin over time. I think a 90 minute cut would make a stronger impact. It's good fun anyway.

If you want to see more of main actor's Kamal Hassan's comical talent, a South Indian super star, try Chachi 420 (1997). That's a thoroughly indianized remake of Mrs Doubtfire: In the disguise of a distinguished elderly house maid, Kamal Hassan enters the household of his divorced ex-wife to get closer to his children he misses so much.",1363132800,,1884,4.896551724137931
