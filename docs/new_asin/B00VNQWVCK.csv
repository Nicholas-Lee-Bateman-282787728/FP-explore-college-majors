7099828,1,B00VNQWVCK,"This trollop does no justice to the true account of Jesus and history. The story depicts Jesus as being ignorant of his Divinity and mission on Earth. Utter nonsense! I found the film to be truly offensive and I wish to warn those who only know Christian facts through films. This film does not follow what is taught in the New Testament books of the bible. I encourage everyone who watched this film to verify my statement by reading Matthew, Mark, Luke and John in the New Testament and make your conclusion.  This is just one more attempt out of Hollywood to discredit Jesus and the Christian Faith.",1429315200,13,602,4.574074074074074
7099829,4,B00VNQWVCK,"...not the divinity or miracles.  If that is offensive to you then you will not enjoy this. We happened to enjoy this take on his story, on facts, on the man as simply a man - or not so simply. Well cast, well acted.  This is simply a different take on the story which may broaden its appeal to those who find the miracles too ""supernatural.""  A worthwhile addition to Holy Week programming especially.",1428969600,18,402,4.405405405405405
7099830,2,B00VNQWVCK,"My wife and I missed the premier of ""Killing Jesus"" on the National Geographic Channel but we were able to view it a few days later via on-demand. Prior to seeing the show I had read a few articles which said ""Killing Jesus"" emphasized Jesus' humanity rather than His divinity but I was still hoping for the best.

Well, we all know how rare it is for a film or television production about the Bible to remain faithful to the text but ""Killing Jesus"" gives ""artistic license"" entirely new meaning. I watched with my mouth agape through the opening scenes with King Herod. One detail after another contradicted the biblical narrative. A short time later the adult Jesus appears on the banks of the Jordan River in search of His cousin, John the Baptist. When the Baptist cries out to the crowd, hailing Jesus as the Lamb of God, Jesus is like, ""What? Who? Me?!?!"" I wanted to shut off the TV immediately at that point. It was more of the same right to the bitter end.

Executive producer Bill O'Riley, screenwriter Walon Green, and director Christopher Menaul created a film about Jesus that largely conceals (or denies) His divinity. The miracles are absent other than a large catch of fish. Jesus' tomb is empty but there's no resurrected Jesus. Also, ""Killing Jesus"" presents the Catholic interpretation of Matthew 16:18 which claims Jesus would build His church upon Peter. But the wording of the Greek manuscripts stipulate that Jesus would build His church upon the Rock (""petra"" - solid bedrock) of Peter's confession - that Jesus is the Christ - rather than upon Peter (""petros""- little stone). ""For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ"" - 1 Corinthians 3:11. But why bother nitpicking through a garbage heap? The only positives in this movie were the performances of Rufus Sewell in the role of Caiaphas the high priest and Emmanuelle Chriqui as Herodius.

Was Jesus just a good man, just a prophet who taught us to love, and merely a founder of one of the world's many religions? Or did God come down and put on flesh ""to seek and to save the lost"" (Matthew 18:11)? ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God"" and ""The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth"" - John 1:1&14. Many denied Jesus' divinity when He preached in Galilee and Judea. Many deny His divinity today (like the creators of ""Killing Jesus"").

Evangelical Christians who know God's Word will be very disappointed with this film. For those who don't know Christ but want to, get a New Testament and read it. Find out who Jesus is and why He came. Ask Him to save you. The Jews and Romans didn't kill Jesus. He purposely gave up His life and died on the cross for your sins and for mine. ""No one takes (my life) from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again"" - John 10:18. Turn to Him. Accept Him. Jesus is the only way. ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me"" - John 14:6. You can't earn your way to Heaven. He already paid your impossible debt. He's reaching out to you. ""For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life"" - John 3:16.",1428105600,27,3406,4.4187898089171975
7099851,1,B00VNQWVCK,I would give this movie no stars but it requires I choose one in order to leave a review. It was a horrible interpretation of the gospel. It portrayed Jesus as a human that sinned and He did not. They left out the miracles and healings that He performed. I feel like it was a non-Christian that made the movie and they were trying to debunk Jesus as the Messiah.,1508198400,2,362,4.185714285714286

7099883,1,B00VNQWVCK,"Kelsey Grammar playing Herod for five minutes was the best part. An agenda driven piece to sneakily attack Christianity and current day politics. I read Bill Oreillys book. This is neither like Bills interpretation nor the actual subject matter. Oreillys book was outstanding. This movie was made by someone who clearly never read the book, more than likely is an atheist, and is trying to cash off its ( the books) success. I rented it for 3.99. I couldn't finish it. Even taking away any supernatural elements ( miracles and such) this book still managed to take liberties with plot. There are things in this movie that didn't happen anywhere in Scripture nor even in Oreillys book. I couldn't finish it. If you haven't read Oreillys book, read that instead. It's a masterpiece and it's a very easy read. If you read it just know that this movie has nothing in common with it perspective and presentationwise.

I don't think that is a good idea.  The story should be told as it's supposed to be told, from the bible.  I had heard it was a good movie but I was not too happy with it.

7099960,1,B00VNQWVCK,"We rented the move Killing Jesus. Jesus is portrayed as a non-personality, who seemed confused, and ineffective.  I haven't read the book yet, but O'Reilly is a thorough investigator and writer. I don't think the movie lives up to a rebel Jesus. Jesus doesn't seem to know he is the son of God.

7099971,2,B00VNQWVCK,"Could have been a much better story if the producers had stuck more closely to the Biblical account and used some readily available special effects to bring more realism to the historical record of Jesus' miracles, passion, death burial and resurrection.  The presentation was really quite lame and done from the perspective of their traditional beliefs and not based on their personal acquaintance with Jesus.

It was very Biblically accurate and it actually had the type of man Jesus on earth, a brown skinned Jewish man not some pasty white anglo saxon blue eyed man.
Jesus was a Jew, even if he was a brown skinned man he is still my LORD AND SAVIOR and I love him and I live for the best I can daily.

7100053,3,B00VNQWVCK,I did not like the way they portrayed Christ. He was indecisive and unsure about who he was and what role he was to play in the redemption of mankind. It seemed that his followers had more faith in him then he did. I did not find it to be an accurate account of his life. Although the actor did portray his suffering before and during the crucifixion well. I can not say that I would recommend this movie to anyone who does not have a good grasp on who he was and what his life and death means to Christians.,1446681600,3,508,4.03960396039604

I, like many other one-star raters, had hoped for something a little better than the recent abominations ""The Bible,"" and it's cropped version ""Son Of God,"" and got something even worse. There is nothing portrayed accurately in this film, especially the idea that Christ didn't know he was Christ. Even the crucifixion, which for once got the placement of the nails as through the wrists correct, screwed up the sign (which read ""Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews"" in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, not just the Latin abbreviation ""INRI""), not to mention completely leaving out the thieves and the storm and the veil of the temple ...

I could go on. Bottom line: This is a heretical piece of garbage. If you are an Orthodox Christian who knows your faith, this will offend you; please heed my warning and don't bother (and it should upset Catholics and even a few of the Protestant branches too).

who?
1. The Jewish people(the high priest in temple,Rabbi(s)
2. Romans, Pilate
3. Jesus caused his own death.
I say a combination of all three. But, the Jewish people(Rabbi's in temple) pushed it and they had
the power to stop it. Pilate ordered his death as a result of the Rabbi's (in the Temple) request to punish him. And Jesus knew what he was doing. That he would die because of this rebellion against the temple and Roman order. But, I certainly feel that the temple high priest could have stopped the cruixfication. I didn't get to read the book.

It gave a peak into the background of each person and what led them to the point in time and what affected their decisions in the role of Jesus' crucifixion.  The book is monumental and unique in bringing light to each person.  The movie had nothing to do with the book.  I'm a film major, so I know that when a book is made into a movie that it cannot possibly be on point to the book, and that when the story is sold that often the author loses all control of the film writing.  However, this film has little to nothing to do with the book.  It would have been good to make a series out of the book and let the characters unfold in a realistic way, because I think a single movie that followed the book at all would be impossible.

7100131,1,B00VNQWVCK,"Note: I saw this miniseries in HD via XFinity On Demand.

After the atrocious miniseries ""The Bible"" and ""movie"" ""Son Of God,"" I thought, ""Could on-screen depictions of our Saviour get any worse?"" This miniseries answers that question with a resounding YES. With more liberties taken than there are holes in Swiss cheese, this three hour bore-fest is an abomination to Scripture and historical record.

I will not even attempt to illustrate every liberty taken with Holy Writ and historical record, but here are just a few.

I. Isaiah appears in a dream sequence to Herod The Great, and he and his counselors speak of him as if he had died a few years earlier. In reality, Isaiah prophesied in Judaea centuries earlier, during the reigns of King Hezekiah and Manasseh, being sawn asunder by the latter.

II. It is strongly implied that Herod Antipas poisoned his father, Herod The Great. That is not true. Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian who lived from around 37 A.D.-100 A.D. records that Herod The Great died from a horrible disease in his intestines.

III. Jesus was puzzled at many things throughout, and in one scene, says ""To report on our drunkenness, Lazarus. My debauchery."" That is blasphemy. Jesus is depicted as being unsure of who He truly was, which is the same heresy shown in ""The Last Temptation Of Christ.""

These are just a few of the many historical liberties taken with Scripture.

There are better film versions of Jesus"" life to view. Allow me to recommend some of my favourites.

""The King Of Kings"" (1927). This silent version, directed by Cecil B. DeMille, is epic in every way. Not Rated.

""Jesus Of Nazareth"" (1977). This six hour miniseries directed by Franco Zefirelli, and featuring an all star cast is a reverent look at the life of our Lord. Not Rated.

""The Passion of the Christ."" This powerful version of Our Lord's Passion is brutal and hard to watch at times. But it needed to be told in this manner, and, like Schindler's List, needs to be seen unedited. Academy Award winner Mel Gibson directed, co-wrote, and produced this film, which went on to earn over $600 million at the box office, and made back its $25 million budget in its first weekend. Rated R (graphic violence), but kids have seen far worse films, so it should have been rated PG-13, in my opinion.",1434499200,8,2307,4.73067331670823
7100132,1,B00VNQWVCK,This movie seems to portray a Christ who is unsure of his own divinity.  It is not an accurate account the life of Jesus as presented in the Bible at all.,1434326400,11,154,3.967741935483871
7100133,1,B00VNQWVCK,"Having read the Bible, this movie is confusing and missing quite a lot of what the Bible teaches.  Jesus didn't know he was divine? Wrong. Why was Mary Magdalene even in the movie if you don't tell why? There are a lot of people and situations that were literally left out, making the movie nonsensical.",1434240000,9,303,4.509090909090909
7100134,1,B00VNQWVCK,"After reading the book, I had much higher hopes for the movie.  It failed to deliver.  Jesus comes across as clueless as to why the events unfold the way that they do. I can understand trying to present the biblical narrative from a human point of view, but that should leave the audience on the clueless side wondering why Jesus acted the way he did.",1433980800,6,351,4.384615384615385
7100135,5,B00VNQWVCK,"Absolutely love this movie, when it came on tv knew I had to have it. Great price also.",1433462400,2,87,3.888888888888889
7100136,5,B00VNQWVCK,A film that mixes history and faith. Proud to have added this to my DVD to my faith collection of films. Go and buy this and you will not be sorry. A quality production and fine acting too. Have watched twice already. You will enjoy the DVD extras.,1433289600,3,248,4.1875
7100137,3,B00VNQWVCK,"I guess there is no plot spoiler. Jesus dies in the end. The script attempted to be historical as opposed to religious, taking a smidgeon more than a dramatic license. The attention to detail of the period and costuming seemed superb. I enjoyed the fact they did the Last Supper correctly, minus table and chairs. The film grossly downplayed the divinity of Jesus, turning this into another film about the Bible that is more secular than following the script. Three members of the supporting cast were excellent as expected: Kelsey Grammer briefly as King Herod; John Rhys-Davies as Annas and Rufus Sewell as Caiaphas.

Haaz Sleiman played a befuddled Jesus who had to be convinced of his divinity. His speech was slow, easy and broken, as I felt he was the guy from which I get my Slurpee. Many characters looked like they were from the region with sun aged skin.

The film was about the life of Jesus and only a small part dealt with his killing, a title O'Reilly seems to be stuck on for better or worse. He attempted to make the film seem historical, and for that he should have hung closer to the Gospel of Luke, in my opinion. He omitted the courtyard disturbance right before his arrest, which many historians consider significant, while he included the ""slaughter of the innocents"" an event historians doubt.

The role of Judas was confusing. Salome was interesting in that O'Reilly spent more time on her than the male characters.

This is a good film about Jesus, if you can get past a Bart Ehrman Jesus. Not as bad as the recent ""Noah"" or ""Exodus...""",1432339200,,1561,4.644927536231884

7100139,4,B00VNQWVCK,"This film was quite inspirational and a more thought-provoking take on Christ's life than the standard, Hollywood glamorized versions one usually sees. Bill O'Reilly did a wonderful job researching the life of Christ before writing his book and giving new insight and detail to the life he most likely led. On the other hand, no person can clearly give an accurate 100% account of what Christ's life was like unless they lived it with him when he was alive. Even the four gospels that the church only allows a person to read through the Bible are not 100% accurate accounts of Christ's life but rather stories for which to follow by. All in all, I would definitely recommend this film, and the book,  to anyone with an open mind to read and watch before just assuming things i the life of Christ are one way and only one way.",1430352000,13,825,4.5369127516778525
