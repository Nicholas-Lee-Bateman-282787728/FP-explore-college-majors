8022204,1,B00024QAR6,It is the worst collection of music from the Ed Sullivan show because it is not full of music but more brief performances.,1432684800,,122,4.3478260869565215
8022205,5,B00024QAR6,"I almost forgot about how Ed Sullivan show use to be the place to hear and see all the musicians and singers of that period.  I just happened to catch a ""begathon"" on our local PBS TV station and rather than donate a bunch of money decided to use Amazon to buy them. I missed many of the 60's and 70's as being in the Navy at sea or in different nations they don't carry Ed.",1396483200,,374,3.9210526315789473

8022210,5,B00024QAR6,"This edition of ED SULLIVAN'S ROCK-N-ROLL CLASSICS is two half-hour episodes of the syndicated ""Best of Sullivan"" series. Jay Thomas narrates vintage film clip montages prior to each act.

All but one are complete performances. A lip-synched ""Good Morning Starshine"" is drastically edited. With the Mamas & Papas medley, they sing live over a studio track on ""Monday Monday"" and lip synch to a ""California Dreamin' "" recording.

Highlights: The Beach Boys 1964 live performance of ""I Get Around"" was just a few months before 22-year-old Brian Wilson's nervous breakdown. He was still in seclusion in Oct. 1968 when the group returned to perform ""Good Vibrations."" The Four Seasons sound great but look self-conscious doing ""Big Girls Don't Cry."" Pet Clark is in great voice for ""Downtown.""
