8044243,5,B0006ZXTS4,"River Phoenix was robbed of an oscar for his role in this powerful and profound movie.  It's not something easily explained, but experienced.  Take a trip on the side of life that society forgets, by the end you'll have a better appreciation of your own life because simply put, it could always be worse. Gus VanZant explores that lonely, funny at times but sad notion in a very compelling way....",1484697600,,397,4.6571428571428575
8044244,3,B0006ZXTS4,"I watched this the other day for the first time in over 20 years. I asked myself repeatedly: ""Is it actually a great movie or merely interesting for its time period , ""edgy"" story and approach?""

One of Reeves' better performances and River Phoenix is always worth watching. The story is one of life, loss , sex, sexual ambiguity and confusion. Misplaced love, forgotten people.

It was an unexpected turn for two blossoming leading actors. It had the sort of impact of Brokeback Mountain in an era where such things were discussed even less and used in entertainment almost never.

Ultimately , It's dated but still interesting.  I see how it tries to shock, which makes sense in its time period, but falls a little flat now, in that regard.
It's Gus Van Sant so it's filmed beautifully.
Worth a watch for nostalgia and/or Van Sant fans.",1481155200,,838,4.680272108843537

8044248,5,B0006ZXTS4,"Hi.
I don't write reviews often but this is my favorite movie of all time.  Definitely the best film of the 90's with ""Schynedoche, New York"" being the best of the 00's.  The past two nights, I have put this tape in my VCR and I'm still wide-eyed awake watching the beautiful cinematography of this film every time.  What really gets me is the overall emotion this film really channels, something that's very intriguing to me, living on the streets and finding the ""open road"", the betrayal at the end, the fate and all too real beauty of the film's star, River Phoenix, who's performance I admire more and more every time I watch it...this is a film like no other.  And it is one of the ONLY Gus Van Sant films I like, which is really weird.  Seriously, I feel like I'm in a parallel dimension when I watch this.  Beautiful, beautiful film.",1255564800,3,841,4.428571428571429
8044249,4,B0006ZXTS4,"I used to be a film critic for KALX in Berkeley, and I interviewed Gus Van Sant for his movie, Mala Noche. It was a low budget black and white art film based on a semi-autobiographical novel by a writer who was kind of obsessed with young Mexican immigrants. In the interview he told me that the writer visited the set but he made the cast nervous. With edgy material like that, I never expected Gus to break through to the main stream, but Drug Store Cowboy did pretty well, and then he got a chance to make My Own Private Idaho. It still seems like a bit of a fluke that a film like this got made.

The film is set in Portland and concerns two street hustlers, Scott Favor (Keanu Reeves) and Mike Waters (River Phoenix). They do travel to Idaho at one point, in search of Mike's mother, and also make their way to Italy. The title comes from the B-52's song. The 'plot' is loosely (very loosely) based on William Shakespeare's Henry the IV part 1. Scott would be analogous to Hal, The Prince of Wales. Hal (the future Henry V) has forsaken the Royal Court to waste his time in taverns with low companions. This makes him an object of scorn to the nobles and calls into question his royal worthiness. Hal's chief friend and foil in living the low life is Sir John Falstaff. Fat, old, drunk, and corrupt as he is, he has a charisma and a zest for life that captivates the Prince, born into a world of hypocritical pieties and mortal seriousness.

Prince Hal and his companions Falstaff, Poins, Bardolph, and Peto, are streetwise but pound-foolish; and these rogues manage to paint over this grim history in the colours of comedy. While joking, drinking, and whoring with his pals he finds himself embroiled in a highway robbery, which is the chief means that Falstaff and his minions have of supporting themselves. Hal is not, however, a pawn of these fellows, but rather coolly keeps his head, does not participate directly and later returns all the money taken. Rather early in the play, in fact, Hal informs us that his riotous time will soon come to a close, and he will re-assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy to his father and others through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Though Hal believes a sudden change of manner will amount to a greater reward and acknowledgment of prince-ship, and in turn 'earn' him respect from the members of the court.

Bob Pigeon is the MOPI equivelent of Falstaff:

Bob Pigeon: Scott. When you inherit your fortune, on your twenty-first birthday, let's see... how far away is this?
Scott Favor: One week away, Bob, just one more week.
Bob Pigeon: Let's not call ourselves robbers, but Diana's foresters. Gentlemen of the shade. Minions of the Moon. Men of good government.
Scott Favor: [under his breath] When I turn twenty-one, I don't want any more of this life. My mother and father will be surprised at the incredible change. It will impress them more when such a ****-up like me turns good than if I had been a good son all along. All the past years I will think of as one big vacation. At least it wasn't as boring as schoolwork. All my bad behavior I'm going to throw away to pay my debt. I will change when everybody expects it the least.

Bob is kind of a father figure to the street hustlers. He is portrayed by William Richert, who wrote the novel and screenplay, and directed River Phoenix in the 1988 movie, A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon. If Bob is Falstaff, and Scott Favor is Prince Hal, then Mike Waters is either Poins, Bardolph, or Peto, take your pick.

Actually, at first there were two seperate scenarios. Mike's story is combined with the Shakespeare/Scott Favor saga in the manner of the cut up techniques of William S. Burroughs. Van Sant got the idea to combine them after watching Orson Welles' Chimes at Midnight. I think that Bob says at one point, ""I have heard the chimes at midnight.""

Anyway, you get the idea that this is a weird film. As if it wasn't weird enough, Mike Waters also suffers from narcolepsy, a disease that causes him to fall asleep in stressful situations. Often he wakes up in the middle of the road somewhere.

Mike Waters: I'm a connoisseur of roads. I've been tasting roads my whole life. This road will never end. It probably goes all around the world.

Story: Story about two street huslers, Mike and Scott, who sell themselves to men or women, in other words, rent boys. Mike keeps dreaming about his mother who abandoned him as a child and suffers from narcolepsy. Scott is the son of the mayor and only does what he does to embarass him. Together they go on an adventure to find Mike's mother, travelling from Idaho all the way to Italy.
Opinion: I have only seen this once and I wasn't really into the movie the way I thought I could be. The only reason I rented it was to see River Phoenix performance. The way he played his character was very believable but I can't say the same for Keanu Reeves. But Reeves has grown up and has improved by a long shot. My tip is to watch reruns of this movie to fully understand the story.
 You'll either really hate this movie because of the dialogue and/or the techniques used, or really like it. If you're a fan of River Phoenix, I strongly suggest you to watch it because his acting is incredible. There's a chance you'll be confused whether you liked it or not because this isn't a film that you will understand the first time played. Watch it again, maybe your opinion might change.
 There's alot of nudity in this movie but they're frozen when they are. I was a little uncomfortable when watching those scenes but they didn't run for long.
 If You're still not sure whether you'll like this movie or not, just rent it at a video store. Make sure it's a DVD because the video version that I borrowed was really bad.",1141344000,2,1745,4.514469453376206
