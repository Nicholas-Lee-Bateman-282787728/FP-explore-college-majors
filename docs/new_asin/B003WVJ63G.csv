8407561,5,B003WVJ63G,"I have been collecting the Funimation Hong-Kong connection re- releases all year. I must say this was  one of the best buys so far (The Bastard Swordman series is my personal fav!!!). For the price and quality I have to give it a 5. Here are brief descriptions of the movies...

LIFE GAMBLE 5/5
A reluctant ironsmith is thrust back into the martial art world when a cast of interesting characters
battle for a precious jade. Great action packed soap opera!!!

SHAOLIN PRINCE 5/5
Twin brothers separated at an early age when a traitor take over the kingdom. They're  groom by two totally different methods to enact revenge. Action and comedy in this one. Great finale!!!

INVINCIBLE SHAOLIN 4/5
Two Shaolin schools are tricked into a battle by a tyrant. Less action scenes out of the three. Film focus more on training. Ending seems unfinished.",1348531200,5,843,4.786206896551724
