2120503,5,B0002US52I,This is a superly produced and accurate history of this great city and the Israeli people. It tells the history and Biblical fate of Jerusalem and it's people. A great movie!!,1306627200,3,175,4.67741935483871
2120504,1,B0002US52I,"From the name of the production company (Hatikvah Film Foundation -- Hatikvah is the Israeli national anthem) to the innocuous packaging design and description on the vhs case, this ""documentary"" seems designed to lure unsuspecting Jews to watch what purports to be an interesting documentary about Jerusalem and the Prophets of Israel,  but which slowly reveals itself to be a ruse and is rather an underhanded attempt at conversion, selectively mirepresenting the Hebrew Bible and ending with the hope that Jews will come to see who their ""true"" messiah is.  Why not be forthright and honest about your intentions from the get go?  I appreciate the support for Israel but am very offended by the sneaky way this film goes about proselytzing.  It is not done in good faith, to say the least.  (Note: I took this film out at the public library and was completely surprised when I realized its true contents)",1198368000,6,907,4.901960784313726
2120505,4,B0002US52I,"Contrary to what many believe, the eternal city is Jerusalem, not Rome. This is shown clearly in the Bile and anyone who checks out the verses quoted will see that they refer to Jerusalem and not Rome. Although not a recent production, nevertheless, it is accurate and consistent with the teachings of the bible. In the end-times, Jesus will return to Jerusalem! This is an excellent documentary on true Biblical interpretation rather than blind acceptance of so-called Christian 'Myths' An excellent 'Myth-buster' and eye-opener for pew warmers and those seeking the truth of the bible!",1184803200,8,587,5.189473684210526
2120506,5,B0002US52I,"Scenic beauty, hot topic focus, and biblical perspective combine to make JERUSALEM, THE COVENANT CITY a fine documentary for gift-giving or adding to one's library.  Narrator Lance Lanbert is filmed on location reviewing past, present, and future as it relates to Jerusalem, referencing scripture verses for those who want to verify his points or see the biblical context--for ex, the three biblical usages of the word ""Zion"" (city of Jerusalem, land of Israel, and the Jewish people) and their interrelationships.  The permanency and overall divine program for Israel are discussed, but only briefly, as the film focuses on Jerusalem specifically.

In addition to the gorgeous panoramas, interesting archival footage is also employed, such as showing the Jerusalem flyover by the Allied aircraft in WWI (Hanukkah, no less), when they dropped leaflets by General Allenby that the inhabitants took as coming from Allah, resulting in the city being taken from the Turks without a single shot.

As the narration moves from past to present, it looks at wars, UN resolutions, and other relevant political highlights that are part of setting the stage for the fulfillment of Bible prophecy regarding Jerusalem.  For example, the Arab uproar after Israeli government's 1980 proclamation of Jerusalem as the ""eternal and indivisible capital of Israel"" is examined, recounting the blackmail ultimatum that all foreign embassies leave Jerusalem or have their oil cut off and the propaganda methods employed by the Arabs to advance illegitimate claims to Jerusalem, which has never been the capital of any other nation except Israel.  The movie concludes with sections on signs of the end of the age (not the end of the world) and the destiny of Jerusalem, the future desecration of a rebuilt Holy Place before the time when Messiah will return to Zion and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem and build her Temple.

For clarity, this is not a current events movie (though some of that is inseparable given the topic), but a comprehensive Christian look at the unwaveringly strong things God has to say about Jerusalem, a city mentioned hundreds of times in the Bible.  Nor is this primarily an evangelistic movie, and nonChristians can at a minimum learn about the Christian perspective through this DVD, but should take note that Jesus as Messiah is unapologetically mentioned as some of the Jerusalem prophecies are too connected to the Messianic prophecies to have avoided this.  As for production quality, it's quite professional, attractive, and by no means a yawner.",1165622400,29,2557,5.201946472019465
2120507,5,B0002US52I,"I highly recommend this presentation of the prophetic significance of Jerusalem.  It examines many Bible passages to demonstrate God's plan for Jerusalem as the ""city of the great King!""  If you want to broaden your understanding of Bible prophecy, this is a great place to start!",1146441600,22,280,5.065217391304348

THE HOLY LAND....
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DVD!!!!
GOD BLESS ISRAEL!!!",1473292800,,87,5.769230769230769
8032031,4,B0002US52I,"This program is a very well done historical filmography with Old Testament scripture used to illustrate the eternal destiny of this unique city.  This film is a validation of Jerusalem as the Jewish Capital with subtle political overtones dwelling on the significance of Mt. Moriah, The Temple Mount, and its impact on the three western religions over the last 3500 years.  The film argues the city belongs to the Jews, given by God!
The film commences with the Covenant signed in 1993 of all the nations of the diaspora with the final act being the Israeli presidential ceremony.  This event many of us seemed to have overlooked in our lives during this period.  With outstanding photography of many renowned sites in Israel the narrator uses scripture to illustrate Jerusalem is a gift from God to the Jewish people.  In Part one it traces the past prophetic history of the Holy City.  I was not aware of the Cyrus Cylinder of 586 BCE found in the 19th Century in Iraq which is praised by the film as restoring  citizens rights to the Jewish people. Part two provides a view as to what the bible reveals as to the present and future destiny of Jerusalem.  Its position is that God will forever protect his city.
This superbly produced work although biased toward a Zionistic perspective attempts to bind Christianity to arguments which I find very interesting and insightful.  The producers stress the spiritual conflict of the God of Israel versus the dark forces of Persia and Greece.  Additionally, the film is not overtly Anti-Palestinian which strikes a nice balance.  Although I was sensitive to the political overtones of the film I very much enjoyed the content.",1440288000,2,1672,4.852112676056338

8032038,5,B0002US52I,This DVD is a short history of modern Israel and Jerusalem and a prophetic history. It is peppered with scripture to show which prophecies have been fulfilled and which are still waiting to be fulfilled. Really an excellent and Biblical treatment of the subject. The filming is interesting with many historic clips of Jewish and other world leaders. Demonstrates the veracity of the Bible.,1316563200,4,389,5.09375
