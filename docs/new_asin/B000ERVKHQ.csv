8325050,3,B000ERVKHQ,"What can be said about the actual movie? It is the standard Godfrey Ho method at work; bad dubbing, use of some obscure movie's footage, with Ninja action interludes. The plot revolves around our favorite ninja, Gordon, training a young disciple, Billy, the training sequence takes place during the starting credits, then the movie moves on ten years later to footage from a Filipino movie that has nothing to do with ninjas, we return to ninja action when we find out that a rouge ninja named Ivan the Red is bent on eliminating all ninjas, including the now grown up Billy, in order to gain the ever elusive ""ultimate ninja power."" The actual video transfer seems to have been from a VHS copy, not an original tape or film, this is made obvious by the constant color banding. The menu is beyond austere; a freeze-frame of one of the actors, with the option to play movie. I wish more content had been added, at least the original trailer, which in the Godfrey Ho tradition, can be even more hilarious than the actual movie. Even with its flaws and lack of content, this is the only version of Ninja Squad available on DVD, so its a must have for Godfrey Ho completitionists.",1367452800,,1176,4.578199052132701
