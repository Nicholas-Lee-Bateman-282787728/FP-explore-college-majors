8401545,5,B001NAC68U,This movie is hugely funny--and the subtitles are much better than a dub-over as the original German adds a lot to the mood whether you understand the language or not.  Keep in mind this is a European (Region II) version and that Region I is not currently available so be sure your DVD player or PC can use it,1355443200,,309,4.237288135593221
