5613289,5,B00BF370VI,"This is an excellent swing workout, good for any level.  Her other workouts are also good (""Roundabout 2.0"" and ""Give and Take""), but this one is my favorite.  It is worth the price.

I combine workouts one and two for a solid 50 minute session.  If I have time, I add the 20-minute bonus workout.  I believe I complete at least 1500 swings after 1 hour and 10 minutes :-)!  I also use the 20-minute workout after some of my other training sessions or before a run, etc.  I love challenging myself with heavier bells with this one.  It is similar to a tabata workout.  Highly recommend.",1369958400,11,586,4.401869158878505
5613290,1,B00BF370VI,"As another reviewer noted, this DVD was labeled as the Top 40, but the actual workout on the DVD is Tracy's Give and Take, which I already own. I was able to return the DVD to Amazon and get a refund. I also contacted Tracy directly and she explained how the mistake happened and suggested ordering directly from CreateSpace, who make the DVDs when ordered.",1367798400,2,357,4.507692307692308

5613292,5,B00BF370VI,Loved this. Not only are the workouts fun and challenging but you can also tailor them to your own personal level. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.,1364428800,7,163,4.655172413793103

8567556,5,B00BF370VI,"Great workout, she has you  sweating right from the warm up. I have notice muscle definition and  the recovery is not painful at all.",1462233600,,133,4.5
8567557,5,B00BF370VI,I have been using kettlebells for 10 years. I was also an RKC II before Pavel started Strong First. I love this video!  It's simple and easy to follow. But not easy....If you want an effective way to lose weight and build muscle without hours in the gym then try kettlebells. Just make sure you get proper instruction first.,1438732800,3,324,4.491525423728813
8567558,5,B00BF370VI,"Another good dvd for kb swing workouts.  This workout mixes up the type of swing a little more than the previous Give and Take workouts.  The swing types include 2-handed swings, single handed swings, and transfer swings.  The workout itself goes by really fast. I am actually using this workout dvd a little more than the G&T 2 dvd.  The only thing missing is the swing count and length of time of the workout.  Tracy please bring that back on your future DVDs!",1422057600,5,462,4.518072289156627
8567559,4,B00BF370VI,"I've read a few one star reviews noting some skips, background noise, etc.  I didn't experience any of those things, and the image quality was perfectly fine.  I understand wanting everything to look like Avatar HD, but the quality was just fine IMO.  Not HD, but not grainy or ghetto.

As an olympic weightlifter exploring the world of kettlebells, I've probably invested $100 exploring different materials like Simple and Sinister, Tracy's book, ""The Swing,"" and her ""Programming the KB Swing"" DVD, among other things.  I'm prioritizing fat loss first and foremost right now, and this workout seems absolutely perfect for it.  After swinging for about a month, I was able to do about 80% of this today, subbing two-hand swings for the single-hand swings.  I did sets of 20 during all but the last minute long set, when I decided to go for it and bow out if I felt myself losing form.  Getting through this workout will be the perfect January goal.  Maybe getting through workouts one AND two can be my February.

Tracy's guidance and leadership is excellent.  I'm impressed that she's able to fill the rest times with clear instruction so effectively.

Only two things lacking in my opinion.  A little countdown timer, even if only for the final five seconds or a rest interval, would be excellent.  I also couldn't find Mark's warm-up.  Beyond those things, excellent, excellent DVD.  Glad I ordered it.",1388448000,7,1406,4.8691983122362865
8567560,1,B00BF370VI,"I am not a kettlebell expert, but have done a few kettlebell DVDs over the years and this is by far the worst one ever! It only has one excercise throughout the entire DVD and it is a basic one. She just increases the reps of the swing. Also the quality of the video was so poor. It was made on iMovie which I use in my second grade class! Not professionally done and poor exercises.",1388275200,,383,4.052631578947368
8567561,1,B00BF370VI,"This might be a great DVD, but the quality is obviously poor.  It skips and when it does play correctly, there is a lot of noise like static in the background.  Couldn't wait to use it....now extremely annoyed.  I'm not the only one who has had this problem with this dvd.",1384300800,,272,4.294117647058823
8567562,3,B00BF370VI,"I ordered and returned this DVD twice because it skipped in too many places.  The first time I couldn't even view the bonus workout and the second time I tried to work through it, however, I was unable to get through the complete workout because of the DVD skipping too much.  I will say that what I was able to view I REALLY liked!  I wish I could have kept the DVD, because I really liked Tracy and what she had to offer.  :(",1379376000,3,427,4.0476190476190474
8567563,5,B00BF370VI,"I so appreciate her providing her winning results and strategy from using the Kettlebell.  I'm 62 and love this workout and her original one.  She has inspired me and I have tried to do the same with my friends and family.
I'm stronger and in better shape for it!  Who knew that at 62, I could still shape my arms and bum for the BETTER.  These are hard workouts and you are soaked in sweat when finished but well worth the time and effort.",1373932800,8,440,4.2023809523809526
8567564,5,B00BF370VI,"I first bought Tracy's book ""Swing"" which totally motivated me; then I bought her ""Give and Take"" dvd - loved it; now I've been doing the workouts on this one. I like that you can make it as difficult as you want...there are two workouts plus a bonus workout.  You can do just #1 if you are lazy that morning - you could do just #2 if you are ""ready to do it"" or you can do #2 plus the bonus, etc.  Sometimes I don't have the patience to listen every time - and I really think that there should be a choice of just swinging along with the instructions written out on the side of the screen maybe - but I wrote down the workout and now I get my ipod and go on the deck and swing there!  Kettlebell workouts are just so awesome! Especially this one.  Can't wait for her to make more.  You will definitely like this one.",1370908800,9,817,4.018518518518518
