8117471,5,B000F4TMHI,The director has a strong love for film and you can see it through his work. Slimy little bastards is a fun horror comedy that shows you don't necessarily need a lot of money to make a movie but a passion for film.,1494028800,,214,4.0

8117473,5,B000F4TMHI,An incredibly fun movie that you could tell was important to everyone who took part in it. Several of the actors got a chance to experiment with unusual characters throughout the vignettes.,1453420800,,189,4.9375

8117476,5,B000F4TMHI,"Forget the name of this DVD! The documentary itself is an amazing piece of work and really pays homage to the bands and the scene they came from. This is without a doubt my favorite music documentary. It's about the community that these bands and the scene they came from that was created because of them. I think it does a great job of also showing how the bands wouldn't be where they are without the fans that continued to come out and support them. It also proves that if your music is good and you build a decent enough fan base to stand behind you, you DON'T need a label to help put your record out. Yes, it's more expensive and more work, but in the end it'll totally be worth it. I legit love this DVD and recommend it to any true fan of these bands and others like them in the genre.",1415836800,,793,4.122580645161291
8117477,1,B000F4TMHI,"Geez. WTF? Why would ya name this video Bastards of the Young?  This has nothing to do with the 80's band, ""The Replacements.""",1360108800,2,126,4.478260869565218
8117478,1,B000F4TMHI,"Okay...so I know nothing about these bands but no mention of the Replacements; whose song ""Bastards of Young"" this dvd takes it's name from?! What do the words of this song have anything to do with this year's crop of musicians? It's a great phrase and it could reasonably be said that the lyrics might speak for any generation of rock and roll, but I'd counter that every generation ought to write their own goddamn song. Not take up the banner of one that was written before most of them were born. It insults me, it insults them, and the creators of this...whatever...suck for not coming up with one ounce of originality on their own. They're as crappy as Kenny G and should retire.",1204156800,33,685,4.532258064516129
8117479,5,B000F4TMHI,"I loved this DVD.  I initially bought it to get some more live performances of some of my favorite bands.  The entire second disc has 3 or 4 live songs by Thursday, Armor For Sleep, The Early November, From Autumn To Ashes, Underoath, Matchbook Romance, and I think one or two others.  The second disc alone was well worth the price.  But the movie itself is great.  It shows the true roots of the music scene that I love so much.  From it's beginnings in the basements of New Jersey, to today, this documentary covers it all.  My favorite part is that it really gives a leg up to some of the up and coming DIY bands out there.  I discovered a band called Paulson through this that are wonderful.  (check them out on [...])  The movie doesn't come across as anything more than it is.  A great documentary, filled with great music, and interviews and stories by some notable names.  If you are even a little interested in the music of Thursday, Taking Back Sunday, Armor For Sleep, Midtown, or Juliana Theory this is well worth owning.",1170720000,9,1034,4.441489361702128
