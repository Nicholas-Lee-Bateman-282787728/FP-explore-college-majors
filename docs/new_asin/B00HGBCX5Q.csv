8632644,5,B00HGBCX5Q,"If you don't know that this is one of the greatest films cum social satires of our modern commercialized era, then you are missing out.

Joseph Kahn is typically a music video director (probably of most of your favorite music videos), and here in his first feature-length film he has created a saturated sanctuary of cartoonish coolness awash by opulence.

Two ladies (in socially asserted fanciness, of the times) square off against one another in a completely non-sensical motor-cycle Kurosawa-esque duel, while backdropped by absurdly (yet poignantly) placed Mountain Dew and Pepsi billboards. What better culmination of the non-competitive nature of our pseudo-capitalistic society than to see two sides of the same adored coin be pitted against one another, as if taste is a matter of competition, and competition is a consequence of taste?!

It's stupid, it's brilliant, it's bright, it's dark, it's obvious, it's absurd, it's unpredictable, and it's unequivocally entertaining.

This film is the culmination -- and mockery of -- the 200+ year American ""experiment""; a master class of motion and emotion in cinema that is a great leap upon the brutally slow slope of progress to elevate film to its cinematic namesake, and truly (and finally, eventually) replace photography with the ultimate expression of kinematics in sight and sound.

Never ignore this, please, recognize its brilliance. We need more of this.",1419120000,8,1419,5.316964285714286

8632646,5,B00HGBCX5Q,"This movie is more fun than it should be. I think the tongue-in-cheek is perfect, and it's the kind of movie that a few beers and good friends make even better.  I just wish this blu had a bit more extras, a retrospective from the creators, where they really get to laugh at the film the duped the studio into paying for.",1401408000,6,321,4.17741935483871
