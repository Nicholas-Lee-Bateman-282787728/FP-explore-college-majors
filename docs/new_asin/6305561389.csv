1047307,4,6305561389,"I came into this series not knowing how it related to the original Bubblegum Crisis of which I was a long time fan.  The story seemed to be earlier, but the 2040 date is clearly later.  The truth is that they are  separate.  This is a new interpretation of the basic premise.  Lina and  Nene are much better developed and more interesting characters.  Priss is  Priss, but Sylia has turned psycho on us.  I am not happy with this new  boomer hating Sylia Stingray.  The animation is good and fluid, actually  better than the original which was sort of awkward.  I have viewed both the  subbed and dubbed tapes.  In this case, I preferred the dubbed ones.  The  dubbing is well done and I get more out of it then when I'm trying to read  and watch at the same time.  A good inheritor of the Bubblegum Crisis  standard, but don't expect it to be quite the same.  Some of the changes  are a little wrenching, but change is sometimes good.",948153600,,935,4.345029239766082
1047308,4,6305561389,"well I am a major fan of BGC and it's really cool RPG. I like some of the new features in this show. But you gotta dig the 80's animation.  One thing, What's up with Leon and Daley?  They were one of the best parts in  the orginal OAV.  And with the hardsuits haveing limited battery time  (which I like and will adopt into my BGC rpg campaigns) and the launching  of the suits like Evangelions is cool, b/c Evangelion is cool.  To new  viewers, go and see the first OAV (and maybe Crash and AD Police).",943488000,,503,4.11340206185567

1047412,5,6305561389,"This TV series is a pleasant surprise. By watching the first few episodes, you'll notice the show dishes out a lot of fan service and action. It seems a little puerile at first.

1047414,5,6305561389,"This is an older anime series but it has a great story line that, for the more technological younger generation, will cause you not to care that it's not cgi or not 'more modern' in it's presentation. If you're female, you need to know it's got great strong womyn as the heroines. It's can be very empowering.  If you're male, you'll love the mech and action side of it. If gender sterotyping doesn't matter - you'll be both empowered and love the story with all it's action and techno geek gadgets. I highly recommend it and also recommend that you get A.D. Police, which for all intents and purposes is the prequel and sets you up for BG 2040.

Oh.. one side note.  If you've seen BG 2040 (this version) you'll notice that there are some very familar voices being used in A. D. Police! Just thought you'd like to know.",1227744000,,820,4.417218543046357
1047415,4,6305561389,"Just a quick comment, having watched Bubble Gum Crisis 2040 first and then the original second, I think there is a directional issue at play. I think your experience of this anime is different if you watch the original and then 2040 or watch 2040 then the original. Though some would disagree with me, I think 2040 is great standalone and does a good job of explaining the characters under a (semi) coherent plot line. I loved it, whether or not it was the first one I saw. Then a year later, I finally found the original and went in with high hopes. Never disappointed me, it had elements 2040 did not.

With many changes from its 2 predecessors, BGC 2040 is an inferior re-make in every way. The wise and elder Sylia Stingray is now 24-years old with long hair. She is less prudent than her original counterpart, and suffers from vioelnt mood swings. Nene now dons short, blonde hair, and is mostly stuck at AD Police HQ where she still works. Linna has been relegated to a coffee-serving secretary office worker who has her hands full trying to ward off the unwelcome advances of her boss. Priss is essentially the only one unchanged from the original. She, along with Linna, are always out fighting GENOM and the Boomers. Nene usually gives them reconnaissance support from her station at AD Police. Sylia, for her part, directs the Sabers' actions from homebase. Also gone are the humorous banter and cameraderie that would always unite are beloved heroines in Battle. In its place are 4 individuals with streaks as dark as their cynicism for life, and who are more than interested in fighting for their own personal gains than a common goal. The animation is very lackluster. It may be cleaner than the original as 2040 supporters will claim, but is also less consistent. The world of BGC 2040 is a sterile one. There are hardly any movements other than those by the principal characters; they seem to makeup the entire populace of Tokyo 2040(where have all the crowds from the original BGC Crisis & BGC Crash gone?). Any other background movement consists mostly of the camera panning back and forth over still images. People and Boomers might seem detailed one moment, and cartoonish the next. In contrast, the original's animation was more lively with people and objects moving, lights flashing in the background. The original also had a better plot and great soundtrack, which were noticible missing from 2040. AnimEigo, the U.S. distributor of the original BGC and BG Crash, was actually given first crack at BGC 2040, but passed when they found it was below their standards. I find it very annoying that whenever AnimEigo releases a classic animated series, ADV follows up by acquiring then horrible re-makes. Such is the case with the wonderful ""You're Under Arrest"", resurrected as insipid, 5-minute ""mini-specials"" that ended up making ADVs catalog. ADV should stop relying on the past glory of products, and get back to the basics that made it a well-repsected importer of Anime during the early 1990s. That was a time when it introduced us to such memorable fare as ""Devil Hunter Yokho"", ""Battle Angel"", and the endearing ""All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku""!

1047418,5,6305561389,"Back in the mid/late 80s, an OAV anime by title of ""Bubblegum Crisis"" (which I think is a military slang term for when technical equipment goes haywire) made its debut on video, taking inspiration from ""Blade Runner"", ""The Terminator"" and maybe even ""Robocop"", with a little dash of Batman/Bruce Wayne - Iron Man/Tony Stark and Charlie's Angel's girl power thrown in for good measure. 8 episodes long, the overall story was that in 21st century Tokyo, Japan, year 2032-2033, living machines called Boomers were doing manual labor and sometimes cause problems. A special, SWAT like branch of law enforcers, the Advanced Police (AD Police for short) were formed to handle the boomers, but were mostly ineffective, prompting millionaire scientist Sylia Stingray, the daughter of the scientist who made the boomers, to create four powered combat armor (hard suits) to be worn by women to fight the boomers and fight the evil corporation that produced the boomers, GENOM. That group becomes known as the Knight Sabers, and in addition to ring leader Sylia, her rag-tag band of rebel women included Priss Asagiri, a struggling rock and roll gal with a passion for motorcycles and a disdain for cops, Linna Yamazaki, an aerobics instructor with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through boyfriends, and Nene Romanova, a young officer of the ADP and expert computer hacker (the first in a long line). GENOM, meanwhile, is represented by Quincy, a tall, gaunt old guy who happens to own the company, his younger assistant Brian J. Mason (killed in episode 3) and an annoying boomer man named Largo. Other characters included Leon McNichol and Daley Wong, two AD Police detectives (Leon appeared in a spin-off/prequel anime, ""AD Police Files"" which I heard was very dark), their balding, overweight boss Chief Todo, Sylia's younger brother Mackey, and a funny little mechanic known as Dr. Raven, who apparently helps Sylia with maintaining the suits. Aside from the overall Knight Sabers & AD Police VS GENOM storyline, there was also another storyline involving a friend of Linna's who was apparently a daughter in a big crime family, the annoying Largo trying to usurp GENOM, and various Priss-wants-revenge-for-a-minor-character story. Oh and did I mention that there were hints that Sylia herself might have been a boomer?

Well, it was a great watch, full of chaos and mayhem and even some very nice pop songs, but it was not without its flaws, some of which, unfortunately, were due to the fact that the series was discontinued after episode 8 when it was originally planned for 13 episodes in all. So some of the storylines, like Largo's scheme (or schemes), the family of Linna's ill-fated friend, and Sylia's origins, were never resolved. Another problem with the series was that at the time Priss was the most popular character, so a good portion of the series focused on her, and unfortunately, most of the Priss oriented episodes basically focused on Priss self-righteously seeking justice/revenge for some secondary character who had never appeared before but happened to be a friend of hers, yet she rarely went out of her way for her the Knight Sabers, who were always bailing her out of trouble and for some reason cared a great deal about her well-being (just to be fair though, she did go to rescue Linna in episode 7, and her boyfriend got killed by a boomer and the ADP acted wrongly in the investigation). This meant we didn't really get to focus on the more interesting back story of Sylia, or even the day-to-day antics of Nene and Linna. Linna had two episodes oriented around her, which pertained to her friend with the mafia family, while Nene managed to snag the last episode for herself, which showed her eternal good cheer was genuinely good spirits and not ditziness. Nene also got to put her computer skills to good use quite a bit, or she sometimes just acted like a lovable goof, which put her screen time and character development a few notches above poor Linna, who was often thrust into the background with only her greed and her tendency to eat up boyfriends to get her any attention. Don't get me wrong, I like it and I love the overall concept of it all, but it did irk me a little bit. Also this is one of those runner-ups for ""worst English voice dubbing of all time"" features, meaning you'd better stick to the Japanese. Some of the voices were okay (some really did match their characters personas) but others were just flat and passionless or, in the case of Priss, really overacted.

Well, Tokyo 2040 comes along and pretty much tosses all that out the window. Set a few years ahead, the story here is that after earthquakes shattered Tokyo, GENOM's boomers rebuilt the city into a big old paradise, except the boomers still have a tendency to fly off the handle, which prompts the AD Police to be formed followed by the Knight Sabers being formed. So the overall story is the same, but the backstories of the characters and the look and attitudes of the characters have changed a lot.

1) Originally Sylia had short purplish black hair and brown eyes, was usually dressed like a stern, proper business woman and was distant from others. 2040 Sylia has more of a super-model look to her, dressing more provocatively and possessing white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light (runs the gamut from blue to purple to silver and eyes occasionally looking purple or gray), and also 2040 Sylia is more of an emotionally unstable woman who flies off the handle when she's not in public, and possibly keeps even more secrets than before. Sylia also doesn't take as much risk on the battlefield, as she is more of a stay-in-the-mobile-pit type here, but she does do battle when she has to.

2) Originally Priss was a short woman with an Afro and a really bad temper, always picking fights with people who offended her, always biting off more than she could chew, etc. 2040 Priss, however, has gone the way of the Clint Eastwood loner - very cold, very stoic and emotionally distant (more like the original Sylia you might say), so she's not really attached to anyone. Also her hair is more stingry and cat-like (a big improvement) and she is clad in leather like Trinity from ""The Matrix"" (although much less annoying than before, unfortunately, the writers screw her in the end when revealing her reasons for hating the ADP).

3) Originally Linna had this big black hair going for her, but now her hair is shorter, browner, and, well, more 90s like. 2040 Linna is also an office lady who has bad luck with being sexually harrassed. As if to apologize for the way she was treated by the OAV writers, the 2040 writers actually dedicated the first 6 episodes to Linna, writing her as a country girl new to the city but determined to meet the Knight Sabers and win a spot with them, which she eventually does.

4) Originally a short red haired girl who was often the victim of ridicule and ate a lot of candy, Nene is now a short blonde haired girl who likes to tease and take pot shots at ADP detective Leon McNichol (revenge for him toying with her in the OAV?) and other characters, even her surrogate big sister Linna and Mackey, Sylia's ""brother"", whom she becomes infatuated with. Cockey and arrogant, she still eats a lot of candy and is a master hacker, but she is eventually deflated and grows beyond her comic relief status.

5) Nigel Kirkland is a new character, a tall, stoic, ruggedly handsome man with long black hair (he looks like Adrian Paul from TV's Highlander), he replaces Dr. Raven from the old series and now serves as the man who gives maitenance to Sylia's hard suits. Nigel is also Sylia's lover, but you wouldn't know it by his demeanor. He's kind of the father/big brother/mentor figure to Mackey.

6) Leon and Daley are back, but of course differently. The original Leon was a tall pretty boy built like a baseball player with slicked back brown hair, blue eyes, a black leather jacket, tight blue jeans, and always carrying a revolver that could magically pack more whallop than a howitzer if necessary; while he wasn't really a bad guy deep down, he was kind of a jerk, but he served mostly as comic relief, as he tried to pursue Priss romantically (exactly what he saw in her is a mystery) but occasionally he and Daley served as information guides to important plot points. Also the original Daley was a fairly muscular red head who dressed in pink/purple suits as he was a flamboyantly homosexual character who was always hitting on Leon when not providing important information. In 2040, Leon is no longer a pretty boy but more your typical rugged tough guy type, with spiked black hair, brown eyes, tall and sporting big muscles, a brown leather jacket and blue dockers (he actually looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger a little bit, or maybe a pumped up Colin Farrell, or Hugh Jackman), and he still carries a revolver, a BIG one, but it's not as powerful as before. Although 2040 Leon still has a bit of an attitude probelm (especially in approaching Priss), he's not nearly as much of a jerk as he was in the old series, but he does have a bad temper and he is easily annoyed by Nene and Daley (also he drinks way too much coffee). Oh, and Leon is still after Priss, but he has a lot more luck this time around. Daley, meanwhile, is now a taller (but not as tall as Leon) more pretty boyish looking guy with red rimmed glasses, a white suit, green eyes, and light brown hair, and he carries a big machine gun (he actually looks like James Marsden from the X-Men films); Daley is a lot smarter and more assertive in 2040 than the OAV and, although it's not completely clear, his homosexual tendencies have been almost totally disappeared, save a moment of what appears to be jealousy when he hears about Leon inquiring about Priss's e-mail.

7) Brian J. Mason (what does that ""J"" stand for?) is back, and so is Quincy, but Mason is much more the main villain here, with Quincy as co-villain, as he is no longer a towering figure of terror but a vegetable with a bunch of batteries and wires plugged into him. Mason now sports slicked back brown hair instead of black hair as he did in the OAV (he actually looks like OAV Leon in a suit) and he is very much from the Alan Rickman school of villains.

8) Though a pervert in the first series, Mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040. Of course, there are lots of things different about Mackey in 2040, but they won't be revealed here.

9) Sylia now has a companion, an Alfred-the-butler type named Henderson, who worries about her and the gang.

10) In the original series, boomers were like the Replicants in ""Blade Runner"", armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions, but in 2040, they're more of the dumb-monsters-on-the-rampage type. Most of the time they're just big robots who do whatever they're programmed to do (heavy labor, combat, clean up, etc) and they have this tendency to ""go rogue"", which means try to evolve and become a monster in the process.

What does stay the same is the theme of humanity VS technology (do machines have souls?). Sadly, this series, though well animated and well written, only runs 26 episodes, so it moves by faster than one might like, especially those of us who are used to more than one season of our most beloved characters, and unfortunately it still ends on a cliff hanger with unresolved storyline bits (which I will not discuss here. What saves this show and makes it what it is, however, is the characters, a colorful cast of screwballs they are, ranging from stoic loners, psycho women, genocidal mad men, rough neck cops, sardonic intellectuals, wise old sages, and loveable innocents, much more diverse than before and with a lot more to play off of, they're enough to make you wish this show had gone longer.

It's not great, but it's a good watch. Also the English dub (by ADV) is quite good, though not without a few flat spots, but certainly better than the dub on the original.",1156636800,3,11989,4.673140691615348

The much talked about remake of the classic Bubblegum Crisis OAV series. The year is 2040, the place Mega-Tokyo. Armed with highly advanced suits of powered armor, a group of young female vigilantes fights a shadow war against the largest mega-corporation in Japan, GENOM, and their army of mad ""Boomers"": androids built to replace humans in menial labor jobs, but which have an annoying tendency to run rampant.

[Note: Check out my review on the Bubblegum Crisis Boxset]

Review: Compared to the original OAV (Bubblegum Crisis), I find the characters much more endearing and believable. Though some may not like the new character designs. For those that favor the original better...shame! The way the plot has been reworked makes a lot more sense, while the character designs may have changed, the mecha designs are just like the original, only more smoothly animated and spiced up with CG effects. I'm not complaining.

Leaving the original, the story takes a step back and describes how the Knight Sabers were originally formed, rather than dumping the viewer right into the middle of an ongoing story. Lots of detail went into humanizing the various cast members. From Nene's snack habits, to Priss's icy mercenary attitude, to Linna trying on her suit for the first time...the characters improve on characterization.

The music is mostly hard rock and pop. The opening and ending themes are both well done. At first, I thought the ending theme was stupid from not really hearing any music. The beginning of the end theme is a bit weird, but turns out rather well.

The end of the series has come, though there may be more to come. I doubt. The ending was a bit unatural to its condition. The love craves and future clean-up were not present when needed.

In all, this is a fitting tribute to the original Bubblegum Crisis. In fact, in terms of character development and action it may have even improved upon the original in some respects. The typically Japanese open ending to the series may disappoint fans who like more closure to their anime, but aside from that, BGC 2040 is a solid, action-packed, sci-fi anime. Highly recommended.",1102809600,8,2152,4.914600550964187
1047494,3,6305561389,"Volume two of Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040 has episodes five through eight.  The first two episodes give viewers a longer look into the strange old man hooked up to wires who is behind some kind of a strange conspiracy at the Genom corporation.  He has a young assistant who is sexually obsessed with a red-headed Boomer (humanoid servant robot).  The old man is hatching a plot that may or may not involve crooked agents of the AD Tokyo Police.  He wants to capture the Knight Sabres and have dinner with them and ""get them to love Boomers.""

This portion of this plot is confusing, but the action is great.  Linna has been almost fully accepted as a member of the team, (seems awfully fast) and it is now Nene who is seeking to prove herself to Priss.  An element of mystery is added with flashbacks to Sylia's traumatic childhood (she is such a beautiful little girl!) when a strange boy arrives saying he is her younger brother. Sylia welcomes him without hesitation, even though her faithful butler does not know the boy.  Mackey does indeed resemble Sylia.

We see Sylia is pretty mentally unstable.  Mackey idolizes Nigel.  Boomers go mad, including one that meshed with its operator when he died in an accident.  The boomer comes looking for his unfaithful wife.  Romantic triangles start to develop.  Leon likes Priss.  Priss likes Nigel.  Sylia likes Nigel.",1094169600,,1367,4.753191489361702
1047495,5,6305561389,"After the ovas of Bubblegum Crisis, this tv series was released. Set within the same universe, but the characters look and act differently than previously. Changes were especially noticeable with Sylia, the rich mistress which funds the Knight Sabers (she used to be one of them, but retired her hard suit). All the quality from the other series continues, but this is one of my favorite animes. The writers improved BGC  by creating more interesting stories and dramatic situations which were not present in the other series. The robot manufacturer advanced by creating Boomers with organic matter (living tissue), they even had a real beating heart to power them. The new Boomer models were mass produced and sold to the public as pieces of machinery.  Sometimes I felt sorry for the Boomers because they were more than just machines, they were intelligent almost to the point of self awareness (a human trait), but they were treated like garbage by the general public. This continued to cause a lot of malfunctioning Boomers, that ended up killing the their owners and innocent people. Also since they contained organic matter, the malfunctioning Boomers usually mutated into monsters- a new challenge for the Knight Saber in every episode. The Knight Sabers themselves underwent some changes and added some new members not present in Bubblegum Crisis 2030. I especially enjoyed the character Nene a perky and funny, pink haired girl. Priss, the leader of the Knight Sabers is beginning to hate her job, thinking that its too dangerous and not worth the money.  We also get more insight into Sylia and her motives for creating the Knight Sabers. We also learn of the enemy company -Genetech, responsible for manufacturing and selling boomers to the public and their hidden agenda. Blood and gore, light profanity and nudity- for teens and adults. Great action sequences and great stories make for a great anime! Ends on episode  26 then connects to the anime Bubblegum Crash.",1076976000,,1978,5.039755351681957
1047496,4,6305561389,"After a bit of a slow start, the series warms up in these episodes. We're delivered another four episodes, and while still not anything special, the series remains enjoyable, with a nice element of mystery.
First up we have a great two-parter in which the Knight Sabers are lured into a trap involving the AD Police and one massive Boomer. This exciting pair of episodes sees the onscreen debut of Sylia's hardsuit. The other two episodes are short rogue boomer encounters - it's fairly episodic.
Despite being episodic, there's little threads running through each episode that hint at a larger plot. For instance, Sylia's brother Mackey arrives, and while he's perfectly normal at first glance, the show somehow makes things seem really awkward, giving the viewer the feeling that there's something here they're not being told. This is something this show does excellently.
At this point in the series, I wasn't completely hooked, but all the little hints and mysteries urged me to buy the next volume to investigate. A good set of episodes in a promising series.",1069200000,2,1064,4.98314606741573
1047497,5,6305561389,"""Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040"" is a remake of the 80's OAV anime ""Bubblegum Crisis 2032"" and it's TV sequal ""Bubblegum Crash"".  I've not seen the originals, but I know ""2032"" is considered a classic.
Storywise, we follow the antics of a group known as Knight Sabers.  These are four girls who have day jobs but at night, they come together to destroy rogue boomers.  Boomers are androids that can look like machines all the way to nearly human.  While an organization known as AD Police was created to deal with the boomer problem, only the vigilante Knight Sabers have any luck dealing with them.
The story at first feels very much like a female version of Batman.  You have the rich Sylia Stingray who's the Bruce Wayne/Batman.  Priss, Nene, and Linna are the Robin, Nightwing, and Batgirl.  However, after several episodes, the series lost the Batman feel as the series begins to shift into an almost non-stop action fest.  There is some humor and some romance to make this series better rounded than it otherwise would have been.
DVD-wise, I wasn't that impressed with the Engish dub.  The Engish subtitles for the Japanese audio is pretty good though I wish that at times the font color/shading had been clearer.  Some fansubbers do a better job at subtitles than the official ones.
There are 6 DVD's in this set.  Discs 1-4 contain 4 episodes and discs 5-6 contain 5 episodes.  Be warned that each DVD starts with ADV previews so you'll have to hit ""Menu"" to bypass all that.  There are no real extras to speak of.  Surpising to me is the fact that there is a Spanish dub in addition to the English dub.  So those who want to watch this in Spanish may do so.
Bottom line: This is a really good mecha anime title with a story that will keep you glued to your seat most of the time.",1050105600,23,1785,4.517133956386293
1047498,1,6305561389,"Well first off I'm going to say.. apart from the mech suits, character's names and the show's name this has no relation to the original series. One of the big parts of the original series was its music, with its slightly cheesy 80's pop rock it gave the series its own flare and style and many of the tunes were quite memorable (new tracks in every episode). This has disappeared in 2040 with cheap 5-second looped dance beat tracks that annoy more than entertain. Then there are the characters. Totally butchered from the original.. Priss in the new series is merely ""broody and monotone"", zero personality. While Priss was certainly the broody type in the original series she had a normal side too, this was shown in her love for weapons and Mackey's supped up mechanics along with good friendships with all members of the Knighsabers (she actually smiles!). I would go into the other characters but I'm limited to 1000 words here. Then there is the animation. While the animation in 2040 looks newer, it isn't better, mech design is no-where near as detailed and animation relies on cheap stills with just the mouths moving much more than the original where they could be walking around at the same time etc. The English dub is 10 times better in the original series too. If only the original series wasn't cancelled at the 8th episode. However the Bubblegum Crash three part OVA did finish off the original series with the same style of music and characters very nicely (same voice actors too, except for Priss in the Japanese dub). There were some big problems with script continuity... but still.. it ended it off nicely.
as a stand alone series 2040 is average.. ... Lets just say get the original series over this one. its shorter.. but sweeter.",1040601600,3,1753,4.713355048859935
1047499,5,6305561389,"If you didn't know, Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 is the remake of the classic series Bubblegum Crisis and Bubblegum Crash.  Although this was originally called a ""techno punk"" series, that feeling is only left to spice up the series, not give it a new flavor altogether.  The characters are made far more realistic in this series, the Knight Sabers organization isn't made to be as fragile or omnipotent as it was in the other two series, and the plot is taken to its fullest extent.
In the year 2040, seven years has gone by since the great earthquake of 2033.  The city has been rebuilt from its base on up by the Genom corporation, and its primary product is a type of worker robot called boomers.  However, boomers sometimes go ""rogue,"" meaning that they lose their original core structuring and change into a monster that has the tendency to ravage the city.  The police can't stop them, so the task is left up to the Knight Sabers, a group of female mercenaries (who eventually turn into heroes) with advanced weaponry.
Most of the series is taken from the viewpoint of Linna Yamazaki, although other viewers may disagree about the true viewpoint.  Although she may be a ""country bumpkin,"" she is far more complex than that.  She comes off as being naive and a bit silly at times, but beneath that lies the glue that often times keeps the Knight Sabers together.  She refuses to take trouble from anybody, and will often stick up for other people without first thinking out the situation.  At the beginning of the series, she is trying to join the Knight Sabers, but she never sees it as another job, but rather a chance to help stop rogue boomers from hurting people and the city that she has just become apart of.
Priscilla Asagiri (commonly just refered to as Priss) is the typical hard rock and biker woman.  She is often times antisocial, very quiet, and aggressive.  This is amplified by the fact that she joined the Knight Sabers for the money and for the thrill of combat with rogue boomers.  She has a deep love for motorcycles and for her music.  Although her hard rock band isn't very big yet, they tour the local clubs in Tokyo, but can often be found at Hot Legs nightclub.  Later in the series, the tough attitude begins to wear off of Priss, as she begins to show more affection towards others, and she stops critizing others altogether.
Sylvia Stingray is the original creator of the Knight Sabers, which is backed by a large amount of capital generated by both her businesses and by the large inheritance that her father left her upon his death.  She is usually found providing the Knight Sabers with support in the rear of the action, giving informational reports and letting them know their situation, even though she is an excellent combatant with her hard suit.  Despite her sexy appearence and her sometimes very feminine comments, Sylvia is prone to extreme outbursts of fury and disgust, which are usually triggered by mentioning either Genom or boomers.  Despite her fragile emotional bubble, she is usually quite calm, competent, and demonstrates numerous leadership qualities.  However, Sylvia knows a lot more about the boomers and Genom than she is willing to mention to the rest of the Knight Sabers, and we only begin to learn their relationship later in the series.
Nene Romanova is the ""baby"" of the Knight Sabers.  While she is 18 and works for the A.D. Police, she sometimes acts half her age.  She is usually teased because of her young age, and her demeanor only enhances the reasons why.  She is childlike, bashful, and is far more playful than even Linna is.  In the Knight Sabers, she is the worst in combat, however, she more than makes up for that with her intellect and excellent hacking skills.  She can usually dig up information on Genom and boomers by hacking through the net, and more often than not, she is forced to hack directly into Genom.
The plot is quite good.  Although it may seem like the ""boomer of the week"" phenomenon at the start of the series, the main storyline is still followed, but takes full hold of the series roughly around episode 10.  From that point on, its a nonstop ride with mostly action, and a little bit of comedy and romance thrown in to spice things up when it seems like it may be boring.  Take note that at this point, they will begin to get more technical, with a more philosophical edge rounding out the end of the series.
The english dubbing was decent.  The only points that can be marked as ""Very Bad"" would be when Priss is singing.  When she does, the words and lip movements do not match at all, but you won't really notice that.  The one part that this series didn't pass up on was a good musical soundtrack.  Priss's songs, even in the english dubbing, are quite good (if hard rock is your thing), and the background music add that little extra to scenes.
If you are a fan of the older series Bubblegum Crisis and Bubblegum Crash, you should definitely see Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040.  It adds a lot more to each of the main characters, and even the more minor characters in the older series are made more important and taken to a much further extent.  I'd have to say that this series surpasses the other's in the music department as well, which was something that made them an underground classic.  The DVD's have some nice extras, however, you may want to skip through the ADV previews at the beginning of each DVD if you don't feel like being enticed into buying some other good anime series.  Still, once you begin to watch this series, you'll soon forget the previews and your eyes won't leave the screen except to put in the next DVD.  =)",1037059200,9,5644,4.593220338983051
1047500,4,6305561389,"Hehe where do I begin. Hot chix's, kick @#% robots, 80's rock music, and lots of fighting. To me this is the biggest ""sleeper"" anime I have seen so far. When I heard Bubblegum Crisis, Im thinking ""great a city with a Bubblegum Crisis on its hand, some Anime"" but it is far from that. These past 2 months I have purchased an insane amount of anime off of Amazon.com (All of Rurouni Kenshin, Gundam Wing, Trigun, Escaflowne, BlueSeed, Fushigi Yugi, X, Arc the Lad...the list keeps going) and this one took me by complete surprise, and I couldn't have started watching it at a better time. I was about halfway through the first set of Fushigi Yugi, and don't get me wrong, its a great anime, but I was gettin a little tired of the ""Oh Tamahome""....""Oh Miaka"" over and over each episode that I needed a break. I picked up Bubblegum Crisis 2040, and lookout man I was hit with a wild left jab out of no where. The rock music instantly grabs you, and unlike most other Anime (i say most) the first episode grabs you right off the bat with a dispute between 2 of the main characters. From there it is non-stop action as you watch these chix battle it out in their hardsuits one [bottom]whoopin after another. The only reason I couldn't watch this straight through in one day was work. I got the series on Monday though and was finished by Thursday. The only thing I thought was weird throughout the anime was Sylia's temper. The reason I say this is beacuse everytime she gets upset she ends up throwing or dropping a glass. The first time she did it, i thought ok shes [upset], I understand. But it happenes again throughtout the anime like 4 more times, and I just thought it was kind of weird. The last thing I will say about this series is that it has a definte AW YEAH factor to it. I found myself many times during the boomer fights goin AW YEAH! As with my other reviews, this only got 4 stars because it is not my favorite anime (close second to Rurouni Kenshin's 25 DVD's of goodness - but nuthin beats the Battousai!)",1034553600,,2020,4.3465608465608465

The animation was top notch, with good music and great dubbing, didn't watch the subbed version, wanted to take a break from reading. ADV films must be realizing how many people are starting to buy the import region 0 discs which are usually around [money] a set. They did a smart thing by offering this one at such a great price, since I am usually one of those people who buys the imports to save a couple hundred bucks. Anyway the plot is pretty strange, but it makes sence for the most part, the characters are well developed, so you actually care if they die or get hurt. There is a little bit of a love story involved which keeps it interesting... Buy the set you won't be dissapointed.",1030838400,,833,4.245283018867925
1047561,4,6305561389,"Alright Bubble Gum Crisis! What is it? Well people know the name, but wonder what is it?! Well it is a good simple series of Anime that has a dare I say, cult following. In Tokyo the city is populated by people and boomers. What are boomers? Well Three years earlier there was an event that destroyed all of tokyo. The Boomers reconstructed the city. Boomers were created by the Genom corp. and the cheif scientist had a daughter named sylia. sylia grew up and believes that boomers are bad and not helpful. Sylia then creates Hardsuits. a battle suit that goes over the body so that people can fight boomers. But not just any Boomers, rougue boomers, that turn on humans and mutate.
Sylia recruited two women to fight with the hard suits since shes off active duty, Priss and Ne Ne. Then the main character, leina is recruited into the secret and elite group known as the Knight Sabers. each pilot has their motives, priss seems driven by something in her past and her utter disgust for the local P.D. Ne Ne, seems like she wants to prove herself, and leina joined because she had been following the Knight Sabers on the internet for the past year, but after she joins she wishes to beat priss. filled with growing doubt in her beliefs, Sylia seems to question herself constantly. The series deals with motives, and a world were media, entertainment and life are cencored by one major corp. There are many alteriative motives, and you'll have to watch the series to find out what they are. definately a good series.
 This is completely different from any other anime's, whiuch is what gives it a unique edge rarely found in an anime topic that has seemed to have gotten more generic over the years, 'fighting robots and pilots questioning there motives.' However Bubble Gum Crisis 2040 adds a creative edge to the series and the topic. it presents it self well, anime fans the feature may seem so different, that its akward, but after episode six you'll get used to it.

But, I have to say, this is one of the better anime series. The story, set in the not-too-distant-future, is played out really well. The characters each have their own feel, my favorite being Priss. I can't complain about the dialogue, since I've only seen it in Japanese (I tend to do that with DVD's). All in all this is a worthy purchase. I recommend this for mecha and action fans.",1029628800,,525,4.313131313131313
1047563,5,6305561389,"This series was good when I bought it as individual volumes, but with the release of this set, I am very tempted to sell them off and buy this instead (probably making a small profit).  It makes me feel that I should have waited, but you never know with these things.
The animation is good, as is story development.  The music in places can be a little annoying, which is true with everything really, but the dub is varient from very good to dire when the lip synch doesn't match the original japanese (especially in the parts where Priss is singing).
On the whole a good series and brilliant remake of the original, though I was a little disappointed with the final few episodes.
For those who don't know, the title is a good p;lay of words, meaning a world about to burst apart at the seams.",1026950400,,793,4.387755102040816
1047564,4,6305561389,"I watched this series both when it was on TV, and again when they were released on DVD here (a few months ago now).
Being a continuation of the original Bubblegum Crisis series answers a few questions I had when I first saw this series.  There were references to indicate that Sylia had worn a suit before, but there had been no sign of her wearing one in this series.
I would rate the storyline as being fairly shallow at first, staying with the series due to the excellent animation, but I found after about the first few episodes that the storyline was keeping me enthralled, and I got so that I couldn't wait for the next episode (shown next week (TV series)).
As with many series', there was a few episodes midway through that seemed to be a bit silly, almost as though the makers were trying to pad it out, but this was rare (and I could be wrong).
If you like suspenseful finishes, this series has it - every episode leaves you hanging with someone in mortal danger, or some new creature (Boomer) that seems almost unbeatable.
The only problem I have with the DVDs is the extended advertisements for ADV when you first put the disk in, but this isn't really a problem. I might add that the starting and ending title sequences tend to go for far too long, but they are made as chapters in themselves, and are easy to skip (referring to Australian release).  The extras on the discs are excellent with good bio's on the characters and the equipment they use.
If you have a surround sound setup with a subwoofer attached, you will not be disappointed as the action sequences usually start with a lot of bass that will have your chair bouncing on the floor (not overdone though....).
I found myself to be constantly amazed at the english voices done for the characters - it added to the characters being strong and independent women, but also allowed them *some* weaknesses as well.  To be frank, the characters showed more depth than most 'live' people on sitcoms and chat shows.
If you are tired of Manga Women being thin as sticks with big chests, you will be pleased here as the main characters have more 'realistic' dimensions.  They are still very tall and thin and elegant looking, but they don't have these humungous [breasts] distracting you from the story by making you wonder how they manage to stand up!
If you like serials and Manga material, you will not be disappointed.  The comparable series here in Australia still sells for about Aus$[money] (about US$[money]).",1025049600,4,2483,4.595936794582393
1047565,4,6305561389,"This series is starting to grow on me.  I gave the first disc three stars, but this one gets four.
Why?  The characters have started to develop, and they're deeper than they originally appear.
For example, we start to get hints of Sylia's past, and witness some increasingly severe mood swings from her, for reasons that are as yet unclear.  (Sylia also wears her hardsuit for the first time in the series.)  The episodes also introduce Mackey, Sylia's younger brother.  There are hints that Mackey is not what he appears, which adds to the intrigue.  We also learn some interesting things about Mason, who is having an affair with a boomer, yet somehow seems to hate boomers.
As with the first disc, the video and sound quality are very good, and although the dub is mostly accurate, I can't seem to get into the English voices (especially Nene's).  As with the first disc (and most anime for that matter), I recommend watching it in Japanese (with subtitles if you need them) first.
In summary, if you hated the first disc, you won't like this one any better; if you thought the first disc was ""ok"" (like me) this disc may get you interested in the rest of the series.

I'm also very pleased that they brought Mackie back (Sylia's brother), although he hasn't shown his perverted side yet. The storyline is good and the soundtrack still rocks!  All in all, I'm very happy with Crusade and I'm now looking forward to the remaining episodes.

This outing of the female vigilantes known as the Knight Sabers is significantly better than the previous volume.  As with the previous disc, the show has numerous well-executed action sequences, a somewhat-slowly developing overall plot (the stories thus far are episodic, but we see bits and pieces of what's going on in the larger world), and a good bit of humor.  What was lacking in the first volume was sympathetic characters.  That has changed somewhat here: the past of Sylia, leader of the Knight Sabers, is explored, and it is far from happy (although a bit too cliche in its angst).  Priss, who previously seemed almost autistic, finally interacts with people in a meaningful (if bitchy) way. Finally, the other two Knight Sabers, Nene and Linna, seem like they're destined to become good friends.  All in all, much better and more engrossing.  This volume leaves you really wanting to see more; the first disc had more of a so-so feeling.  The only problem to note here is some noise in the MPEG encoding--some smooth lines occasionally become blocky.

I honestly had not expected anything to be as epic as the first series.  The original eighties Bubblegum Crisis is incredible, and it is no mean feat that the sequel series manages to be every bit as amazing.  Stylistically, of course, it is a bit different.  The sequel series has a much more 1990s feel and the music lineup has gone from the (admittedly excellent) '80s J-pop of the original to something decidedly more punk.
