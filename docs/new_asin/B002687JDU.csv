8352350,5,B002687JDU,"This humble, little dvd holds very big Truths...i.e.,there is a God whose nature is that of Unconditional Love with Infinite Power, Knowledge and Bliss and this is Who we meet upon so-called ""death"". These people met
Him/Her/It or the ""Being of Light"" and returned totally transformed by their unexpected encounter. Now who wouldn't want to hear their story? A fool? But unless you wish to be or remain a fool, I suggest that you not only take the time to watch and listen to what these people have
to say but apply it to your own life so that you too can feel the joy of living in alignment with these powerful teachings, experiences and truths. If your addicted to feeling lost, sad or depressed, better aviod this dvd altogether as there something infectuious about it. (I hope I didn't buy every last copy! Just had to send it to everyone I love ).
  Complimentary to this dvd are ""Infinity The Ultimate Trip...""and ""Round Trip"". Both are excellent in and of themselves. All highly recommended! Enjoy the journey! Share the love! Feel the joy! Live up to your life's full potential, with purpose, dignity,meaning and without fear as you were meant to and as these NDE'rs now do after their direct experience with the ""Being of Light""!",1266883200,3,1238,4.700460829493087
