8747858,3,B01AO2DBJK,"An interesting English language, Euro-theatrical film hobbled together from several episodes of the short-lived ""The Man Who Never Was"" American TV series. Robert Lansing is superb along with Dana Wynter (an ideal companion for him and first paired on TV's ""12 O'Clock High"" in 1964). While somewhat disjointed story telling, the on-location shooting in Cold War-era divided Berlin adds to the classic, mid-century spy versus spy motif.",1530576000,,436,5.522388059701493
8747859,5,B01AO2DBJK,"One of the GREAT TV series! Albeit short lived. This iteration culled from the 1st four episodes. Lansing is his usual taciturn self while the icey beautiful Dana Wynter plays his pretend wife. She discovers early on that he is not whom he pretends to be... a doppelganger much different than her mean-spirited, self-absorbed millionaire husband. And she loves the new and improved model with whom she has become entangled. She is not just ""eye candy"": she is required, as his front, to keep him on guard of  the differences between the two to her friends, business associates and acquaintances. Their adventures take them across Europe in a thoughtful and tense spy thriller. The inimitable Murray Hamilton plays Lansing's CIA contact. Tense, compact well acted and written. KUDOS ALL AROUND!",1490400000,4,793,5.1
8747860,5,B01AO2DBJK,Brilliant. Love Robert Lansing. I wish the whole 18 episodes were available though. Another smile with a missing tooth.,1481241600,3,119,5.315789473684211
8747861,4,B01AO2DBJK,"It great to finally have this movie available.
It's hard to find Robert Lansing's work available on DVD.
The quality of the DVD is decent, no complaints.
It would be great if the second movie (The Spy With The Perfect Cover) adapted from this TV Series ""The Man Who Never Was"", would also be available for purchase.
Robert Lansing is an actor who should not be forgotten.
I'd be happy to own both movies based of the TV Series.
Thanks for this one!",1454112000,6,448,4.409638554216867
