361756,1,6301782712,"This is  a great George Sanders, as the bad guy, and Louis Hayward, as the good guy, film shot in the 1940's.  It even has Clayton Moore (the Lone Ranger) in an early role showing his face (for those of us who were fans of the Lone Ranger but never saw his face).  I've always liked this film.  It has a plot line similar to the Prisoner of Zenda.  George Sanders is always great as a villian.  It was a low budget B film but the director and actors did good with what they had.  That is the up side.  The down side is that Cheezy Flicks Ent copy of this film is marginal at best.  Its such a bad copy that after watching the first 10 minutes I had enough and stopped the film. I gave it away at as a white elephant gift.  A bad copy of a good film is still a bad copy.  It looks like a copy of a copy of a copy.  This film is one that someone like Artisian should restore and release again.  But instead of buying this copy you should run away as fast as your feet can carry you.

Marengo Films has just released this film as part of a two film set and the copy is excellent.  Forget this one and buy that one.",1134432000,5,1111,3.8755555555555556

The son stumbles upon the knowledge that the wicked general of Litchenburg was plotting to become king by forcing marriage to the queen Zona and by killing anyone who got in his way.  Of course One of the major heros in this film is the son of the great Count, so he exhibits the same strength, sword fighting skills, and honor of his father.  This is an excellent movie plot filled with drama, romance, betrayal, and action.  Louis Hayward has to disguise himself as a fool in order to uncover the evil general's plan.  This disguise is similar to the fool's disguise of the recent remake of the Scarlet Pimpernel.

361954,5,6301782712,"The Son of Monte Cristo, 1940 film

In 1865 the tiny country of Lichtenburg in the Balkans is menaced by its powerful neighbors. Its people are loyal to their monarch Grand Duchess Zona. General Gurko Lanen controls the army. An attempted assassination of Lanen failed, the blacksmith will be hanged. Grand Duchess Zona plans to flee to Paris and seek help from Louis Napoleon and his French troops. Her servant betrays this plan! General Lanen accuses Prime Minister Von Neuhof of treason, and locks him in the dungeon. A troop of cavalry pursues the coach of Zona. There is an accident, but a hunter transports them through the forest on horseback to an inn. Soldiers arrive to retrieve Zona. Von Neuhof is condemned for treason. Lanen wants a marriage to make himself ruler of Lichtemburg.

The army hunts for an unregistered and subversive printing press; one man betrays the printer. This printer escapes and hides where they will never find him. Can those who want freedom free Von Neuhof? The Count of Monte Cristo has a plan and a disguise. As a banker he can meet General Lanen. Is a banker more powerful than a general? The loan of 25 million francs will mortgage the country. [No mention of collateral.] Can Von Neuhof be rescued? Yes, but they have a narrow escape through a secret tunnel! Can Von Neuhof escape to Paris? Who is ""The Torch""? Can kites distribute pamphlets around the city? ""The Torch"" may be a danger from being admired by the people. France recognizes Von Neuhof as the government. Could the threat of a Russian invasion change the attitude of Zona? Lanen visits Zona and offers a deal; it is refused. Does she trust the wrong man? Stadt wants to be chief of the Secret Police. Will he get his proper reward? The trap is set.

Zona and Matilde go to the postern gate. The trap swings shut, but ""The Torch"" escapes. Stadt follows through the secret door and talks to Monte Cristo. A mistake. The Russian Ambassador visits General Lanen, they will put Lanen on the throne and keep him there. This will make Lichtenburg a Russian province! Zona agrees to marry Lanen. ""The Torch"" robs the Russian Ambassador of his secret paper. ""You'll hang for this."" Can this paper create a popular revolt? Lanen surmises the identity of ""The Torch"". Can he get proof? He tells Zona of the capture of ""The Torch"". This trick works! The Count of Monte Cristo is arrested! The Royal Marriage is announced. ""This is the happiest day of my life!"" Prisoners are brought into the dungeon. [Trojan horses?] Edmond plans to reveal the secret treaty and stop the wedding. [The dress of the priest says Greek Orthodox.] The ceremony begins. ""The Torch"" arrives at the palace and there is conflict. But Lanen has a trick to force the marriage. Something happens! Lanen falls and doesn't get up. ""Long Live Zona of Lichtenburg!""

This would be an ordinary adventure movie except for being made in 1940 (given the European situation then). Given the year, this small country that wants the protection of French troops and is afraid of Russian troops must be in the Baltics, not the Balkans. A change in the rulers of a country has an effect on surrounding countries (see European history). There is a hidden message here (as in ""The Prisoner of Zenda""). Does Lichtenburg's importance derive from its geography or from its exports? That isn't mentioned. Who controls the army controls the government, then or now. [Was the character of Edmond based on ""The Scarlet Pimpernel""?]",1393113600,,3476,4.778702163061564

362042,4,6301782712,"""The Son of Monte Cristo"" is a most enjoyable swashbuckler.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with Dumas -- apart from the title and the most glancing reference to the Count his father -- but the story is exciting, suspenseful, and romantic, and the primary performances are excellent.  Louis Hayward displays his characteristic enthusiasm and lan in the lead role, Joan Bennett is more utilized than in many of her other Hayward co-starring vehicles, and George Sanders makes a fine and dastardly villain, as ever.  Production values are pleasing as well.

The film is only marred by some regrettably wooden supporting acting -- notably by a pre-""Lone Ranger"" Clayton Moore, and a story that goes on, perhaps, fifteen minutes too long and falls thereby into a more contrived ending than was necessary.  This is unfortunate, since the story establishes a ready-conclusion around the 85-minute mark, but, perhaps trying for one more action set-piece, things are carried along to the point where story-logic is sadly damaged.

That said, this is a most worthwhile film, and the Alpha Video release is acceptable -- better than their usual low-quality ""slap it on video"" efforts.  By the by, I have both the VHS and the DVD Alpha releases, and the DVD is a bit better in video quality.",1297382400,6,1281,4.957943925233645
362043,2,6301782712,"This movie has nothing to do with the Count of Monte Cristo other than saying, his son, the central character, inherited his wealth from his father. A misleading title.

1-hour of story is stretched to 1-hour and 42-minutes. Promising; but falls short. The damsel in distress has no personality; a poker-face throughout the entire film. Thus, we do not care if she marries the bad-guy or not. The hero opens the story, by ruining the damsel's escape. The hero proclaims himself the best swordsman in Europe at the beginning of each and every sword-fight; and then proceeds to lose each and every sword-fight. Thus, we are in doubt of the hero's competence throughout the film.

The film has good interior sets of old European charm, but most of the film takes place in the castle on the same sets. Good costumes. We hate the bad guy. There are secret passages, and a traitor, and friends helping the hero. Thus, the film has promising elements, but fails to satisfy for a lousy, script.

The hero has his sword-point pressed against the stomach of the bad-guy, but inexplicably, allows the bad-guy to just run-away; and then shouts, ""After him"", running after the bad-guy.

I recommend instead: All of the several versions of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"", ""At Swords Point"", ""Kidnapped"" Disney version, and ""Captain Blood"".",1278288000,,1347,4.920704845814978

362045,4,6301782712,"THE SON OF MONTE CRISTO begins as a typical 40s swashbuckler and stays that way from start to finish.  This is not necessarily a bad thing either as audiences of any decade tend to be mesmerized by dashing heros swinging from chandeliers as they duel, by plotting but smooth talking villains who enunciate with crisp diction their nefarious deeds, and by lovely damsels who are loved by the former but lusted by the latter.  This is, in essence, the thrust of this film, which is, more or less, a sequel to the COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, with Robert Donat as the count.  Here it is Louis Hayword as the count's son who like his father plays the Superman/Clark Kent identity reversal made popular by earlier and later versions of ZORRO and the SCARLET PIMPERNAL.  For a swashbuckler to work, the hero must convince on two levels: he must be a rich fop whose smiles radiate a sense of weakness and whose diction is cloyingly annoying.  Further, as the masked hero, he must possess athletic ability while dueling, leaping over walls, and all the while trading quips and witticisms with the bad guys. This Hayword does with panache.  Yet, the hero does not live in a cinematic vacuum.  For his swashbuckling to form the moral center, this hero needs a worthy villain.  The villain here is George Sanders, who has made a career of playing the elegant smooth talking heel.  Director Rowland Lee had to walk a fine line by not permitting the more dashing Sanders to steal scenes from Hayword.  It is a tribute to Sanders that it is he who is the unintended moral center, which in his case is the immoral center to which the audience responds.  Hayword smiles, laughs, and plunges ahead in scene after scene but mostly on a one note basis.  We rarely glimpse the man behind the smile as we so easily can with say Errol Flynn as Robin Hood.  But with Sanders, we are mesmerised from the start.  He is tall, immaculately dressed, resonant, and possesses the good manners of a villain who knows when to ditch them.  Further, when he lusts after Joan Bennett as Princess Zona, we are truly unsure whether he desires her with the same zeal that he does her throne.  We can see a soul in torment.  We can see a man who leaves nothing to chance.  And we can see a man who can improvise on the fly when chance insists on rearing its unwanted and unexpected head.  Thus, the film revolves around the triangle of Hayword, Sanders, and Bennett with the plot aiming squarely at the upcoming nuptials of Sanders and Bennett with Hayword as the determined masked party pooper.  The movie is aided by both a panoramic succession of royal scenes of castles and Gothic hidden rooms and by a very able supporting cast led by Ian Wolfe and Montague Love, both of whom were dependable staples of the age.  What emerges by the film's end is a totally enjoyable trip in the celluloid world where hero and villain fight over the most basic of ends, the love of a woman or of power even if it is not always clear which is the stronger.",1248480000,3,2999,4.516666666666667
362046,5,6301782712,"I bought this film because I missed the good old days when I was athletic and young. I fenced as a kid and was always happily surprised when a new SwashBuckler (SB) came out.  In this typical ""B"" film the old Louis Hayward sword and cloak genre, of many Monte Cristo and other SB's, Monte Cristo saves a nation from evil in the usual manner, by the clanging of sharp steel and innocent and childlike planning, which strategies would not win a checkers game, let alone a game of life and death chess. But in the end, the fun of watching a film from one's days of innocence, trumps it's lack of intellectual stimulation. If you are in a nostalgic mood, or buying for a boy under age 10, you can't go wrong here, despite the black and white film. I give it 3.5 stars, the last star and a half for nostalgic reasons",1168300800,9,811,4.266233766233766

7815226,4,6301782712,"It's not that this movie is an original stroke. It's not at all a fresh take on swashbuckler cinema. There are blatant whiffs here of THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL (1934), THE MARK OF ZORRO (1940), and THE PRISONER OF ZENDA (1937). And, given, the production values aren't quite as sumptuous as those other, more lavish projects. But there's a lot that's on point. THE SON OF MONTE CRISTO sets itself in 1865. It embroils Edmond Dants, Jr. - the richest man in Europe - in the overthrowing of a tyrant. It compels him to assume dual personas, that of a foppish French banker and that of an incognito swordsman. Two things motivate him to do this: his passion to right injustice and his falling for the deposed young queen of the tiny yet proud Balkan kingdom of Lichtenburg.

THE SON OF MONTE CRISTO (1940) has ties to THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, the 1934 triumph that starred Robert Donat, but they go beyond the obvious. Both movies were directed by Rowland Lee and produced by Edward Small. Small tried to cast Robert Donat for THE SON OF MONTE CRISTO, except that Donat had just won the Academy Award for GOODBYE, MR. CHIPS (1939) and so his fee had skyrocketed past THE SON OF MONTE CRISTO's budget. So, instead, Louis Hayward got the lead and was reunited with Joan Bennett, these two having earned terrific cachet from their turn in the James Whale-helmed THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK (1939).

Hayward is equally marvelous as the vapid dandy what's more concerned with the social season and as the awkwardly masked freedom fighter, the Torch (seriously, how does he breathe in that thing?). Hayward plays both roles with a twinkle in the eye. Even the cruel general observes his adversary's playfulness: ""Whoever he is, this Torch is dangerous. He has a sense of humor."" At one point, Dants smirks, ""I'm worn out climbing in and out of windows and up and down chimneys. It would be such a relief to go thru an ordinary door again."" Heh. Meanwhile, there'd always been something about Joan Bennett, who was lovely as a sunrise, graceful as a minuet. To me, she radiated a keen sense of intelligence, of depths unplumbed because this or that role didn't call for them. She does well as the Grand Duchess Zona, young sovereign to Lichtenburg, a nation controlled behind the scenes by the ruthless proletarian despot, General Gurko Lanen (George Sanders), whose ambition was to rise above his common stock and marry the Grand Duchess. When Zona dares to defy Lanen by sneaking off to seek aid from France's emperor, and the visiting Count of Monte Cristo inadvertently mucks things up for her, well, it's only right that he makes amends.

George Sanders, by the way, is nearly unrecognizable in his high and tight buzzcut and skinny mustache, that is, until he speaks. The slow, elegant rolls of diction are highly distinctive. There's some dimension to Sanders' heavy. I like that he was subtle and patient enough in some things, but savage and direct with other things.

I don't think I'll ever get swashbuckling fatigue. Furious swordplay, laughing in the face of danger, regarding the toppling of a wicked regime as a sporting proposition - and with the age of chivalry as the backdrop - yeah, that's my jam. So, never mind that the plot winds down a familiar avenue, THE SON OF MONTE CRISTO is old-fashioned derring-do and enlivened by a game cast that numbers Florence Bates in fine fettle as the unduly solicitous countess, Montagu Love as the endungeoned prime minister, and Ian Mac Wolfe as the despicable manservant. Bit parts go to a pre-Dick Tracy Ralph Byrd as an assassin and a pre-Lone Ranger Clayton Moore as a sympathetic palace guard. Not that the Torch needed Tracy or the Ranger. After all, Dants' dad was the greatest swordsman of the land. Some of that did rub off.",1462752000,3,3777,4.718181818181818
