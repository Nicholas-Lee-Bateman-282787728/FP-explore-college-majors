2645056,5,B000HWZ4IO,"If you waited until now to purchase any of the Andy Griffith Show season sets, this is a decent deal. For those who already have one or more seasons, the new extras in this new all-season set are no big whoop and in my opinion is not worth purchasing.

The pilot episode included in this set is a syndicated version which is edited by about 2 and a half minutes. This is the same version already available on the Make Room For Daddy - The Complete Fifth Season DVD set. The full length pilot had been released on VHS, but has been out-of-print for a few years now. Why couldn't Paramount include the full length version? We know it exists.

The two edited episodes in Season 3 remain edited. ""The Darlings Are Coming"" is the heavily cut syndicated version. ""Barney Mends A Broken Heart"" is still missing its epilogue. Source material does exist that would restore these episodes.

The episodes on discs 1 and 2 of Season 4 that were missing the laugh tracks have been corrected (with the odd exception of the last few minutes of ""A Black Day For Mayberry"" and ""The Sermon For Today"", where the laughter has still not been re-inserted), but this was done way before this new box set was ever announced. If you have these discs without the laugh tracks, I believe Paramount is still replacing them with the corrected ones. See my review of Season 4 for more details.

The ""Opie Joins The Marines"" episode of Gomer Pyle, USMC has been included. However, this will be released anyway when Season 2 of that series rolls around in a few months.

The TV movie, ""Return To Mayberry"" finally makes it's way to DVD as a bonus feature in this set. It is uncut and presented just as originally broadcast in 1986. Hopefully it will be released as a separate disc for those who already have some or all of this series.

Without even going into the packaging issues, this new box set is already somewhat of a disappointment. If you can afford it, stick with the individually released seasons.",1177200000,204,1977,4.53932584269663
2645057,5,B000HWZ4IO,"I agree with the other posters who pointed out that this upcoming box set needs to be COMPLETE.  Yes, that includes fixing the previously edited episodes, and those missing the laugh tracks.  However, let's not forget that if we're really talking about COMPLETE, then they also need to include the CAST COMMERCIALS from the first and fourth seasons, and from the fifth season if there were any (I think by around 1965 or so most shows had ceased to film cast commercials).  If they do this, I will gladly pony up another $150 bucks even though I have already purchased all eight seasons individually.  On the other hand, if they don't get it together with this release and make it the COMPLETE series, forget it.  Five stars for the show.  As for the box set itself, that remains to be seen...",1176508800,10,793,4.588652482269503
2645058,5,B000HWZ4IO,Greatest television show of all time in my opinion. My wife and I just love this show. The show definitely loses out some what after season five when Don Knotts (Barney Fife)leaves. It was still worth every dime I paid for it.,1175126400,4,226,4.404761904761905
2645059,5,B000HWZ4IO,"Looking forward to getting The box set of The complete Andy Griffith Show. Thoe this probably has some fans upset for those that already bought each of the season sets,and considering Paramount is throwing in Return To Maybery in the big box set. One of the big reasons why I decided to go for the box set I have always enjoyed The Return to Maybery movie. As for the series The Andy Giffith Show is a TV classic. Thoe I'm not a big fan of the color episodes thoe I never realy enjoyed the color ones. I like the Black and White episodes the best. Something happen to the show when Don Knotts left. My mother is a huge Don Knotts fan and she too did not like the show after Don Knotts left,my mother believes Don Knotts was the true star of The Andy Griffith Show. Don Knotts did guest star in some of the color episodes such as The Legend of Barney Fife. Well anyway looking farward to getting the big box and I hope Paramount remasterd Return to Maybery?",1174176000,6,956,4.258241758241758
2645060,5,B000HWZ4IO,"I only hope that this time the series is really COMPLETE!! Lets not have any edited shows or shows mising laugh tracks this time. If it is complete this time, I give it 5 stars. If not, I give it a half star. With the exception of a few edited shows and shows missing laugh tracks with their first release, the sets were done really well. All of the shows looked really good and the transfers were done really good also.

UPDATE: The series receives 5 stars! This collection as well as Paramount receives a star and a half. The DVD transfers are excellent! But the new box is shoddy. The folders they packed them in WILL scratch your DVD, and the footage that was missing before is STILL missing. Paramount just reissued the previous DVD release in a different box. They did convinve me after buying this not to buy their I LOVE LUCY complete series when they re-box it though. If you bought the series in the single season release, keep them! You already have this set if you have them. The extras are nothing to write home about. Return to Mayberry doesn't look like it was even cleaned up before they did anything with it. Barney would throw the book at you Paramount!
Update 7/30/2007
Saw on TV Land Barney Mends a Broken Heart. The other reviews are correct: The DVD does cut out the epilog. Peggy is mending Andys eye and they are making up when Barney spills the beans they were out on dates when Andy got beat up.
Thanks Paramount for releasing edited episodes. Just what I look for in a ""complete"" series.",1173484800,35,1514,4.426523297491039
2645061,5,B000HWZ4IO,"I have all eight seasons of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and the only thing missing is what they are offering here..the pilot episode featured on Danny Thomas show and the 1986 reunion movie ""Return to Mayberry"".

Unlike the Mash medicine and martinis collection, which upset many folks who bought the individual seasons and did not receive any extras with them,there aren't too many extras in this complete set. I already have the pilot episode on the ""Make Room for Daddy"" five DVD set which came out in 2004 and I would like to have the movie, but maybe they will offer that seperatly.

What can be said that hasn't been said about one of the most beloved series of all time? Most people will love the first five seasons in black and white that featured Don Knotts, but all of the seasons have their appeal.

If you don't have the entire series, or just a couple of seasons, this set will be worth it. The price is nice, just like the Mash Martinis and medicine collection was before it went sky high.",1173052800,37,1000,4.483516483516484

2645164,3,B000HWZ4IO,"We'd finally given up hoping Paramount might release the rest of the series on Blu-ray Disc (BD).  Amazon having the complete dvd series on sale was the final nudge we needed.  It's nowhere near the quality of our Season 1 Blu-ray set.  Obviously the video is more compressed and considerably less detailed, but even the sound is a little uneven.  Some episodes sound like they cleaned up the audio stems a little, but failed to properly equalize the volume afterwards.  It's not terrible, but definitely not as polished as the season one BD edition.

It's nice that the second and third seasons include the original advertising skits with the cast, like the season 1 Blu-ray did.  Though, it would have been MUCH nicer if the skits were actually watchable along with the episodes themselves, like with the season 1 Blu-ray, which gives the option of viewing with or without original sponsor spots.  In addition to the skits, the season 1 BD also includes the opening and closing sponsor materials, some feature Andy and Opie singing for Post.  Surprisingly this set doesn't actually feature the original skits for season 1 itself.  Only seasons 2 and 3 are included.  Implying that Paramount must have put a lot more effort into bringing the show's first season to BD than just remastering the picture and cleaning up the audio files better.

In addition, the Blu-ray release of season 1 also includes both the original Danny Thomas episode that the show spun off from as well as the ""Return to Mayberry"" TV movie it ultimately finished with.  Return to Mayberry can be purchased separately.  I'm not aware of any other release featuring the Danny Thomas unofficial pilot though.  Collectors will definitely want both, IMO, making this collection seem less than complete.  Hopefully, Paramount will someday get around to finishing overhauling this classic series in HD on Blu-ray.  Until this, this is about the best we can hope for, which is a little disheartening after experiencing how much better the Blu-ray release of Season 1 is.

In addition, I'd like to ad that, while the case holds the discs securely, it holds them a little TOO securely.  Great care and patience has to be taken to remove the discs, as the disc hubs are so poorly designed.  It takes me about a minute just to remove a single disc.  Any kid would break the disc for sure, trying to remove it.  That's almost guaranteed.  A family member with arthritis in her hands wouldn't have a chance.  So, if you're buying for a elderly fan of the show, think twice.  This is a excessively economical case design known to annoy collectors (the trays have two discs per side, one overlapping the other, so you've got to remove two to get one) compounded by an extremely dysfunctional disc hub design.  We've purchased the complete DVD series of MacGyver and Star Trek Enterprise, which use the same type case, but with dramatically better hubs.  Paramount needs to badly update this case too.  I personally, can't fathom how such an inoperable disc hub could ever get made, much less pass Paramount's inspection before choosing such to use with one of their most celebrated and still immensely popular properties.",1510704000,4,3180,4.860594795539034

2645210,1,B000HWZ4IO,"This isn't as much a reflection of the show itself as it is of the product. I love the Andy Griffith Show, at least the first five seasons. Once Don Knotts left I found my desire to watch the last three seasons had waned. I already own the first five seasons that I keep in sleeves in a disc case. Recently I have really been looking to get complete box sets of shows I enjoy, usually trying to find them on sale. I was excited to buy this complete series and re-watch the first five seasons and perhaps sometime make it onto the last three. However, as I opened the package I was disappointed. The box set from the outside looks nice, with the show divided into two cases- the first 5 seasons and then the last 3. However when I opened the cases came the disappointment. Discs were lose and sliding around. Annoying but somewhat understandable. Then I saw that one of the plastic clips that hold the discs in place were broken. That got me. What should I do? Leave the disc to slide around in the case for all time? Store it separate from the rest of the box set? I didn't want to go through the whole hassle of returning it but it tipped my hand. Then I had a decision- refund or just get another set? I opted for the refund and a worry crept into my mind. Had I gotten lucky before in not having other disc cases broken? Or was I unlucky this time? Or was it just the inferior quality of this certain product. With the date of my Prime renewal coming up, from this experience (and the hope to spend less) I will probably pass on the time being.",1509753600,7,1547,4.194630872483222

Unfortunately, Amazon puts reviews for related items all in the same place (Please stop doing that, Amazon!!) This must be a new edition, not the problematic one with cardboard sleeves. The DVDs snap into place, each in their own plastic resting place. Not going to get scratched easily! The episodes are divided into two sturdy plastic cases--probably a good decision, as so many episodes would be tough to manage in one large case. (It does have just one cardboard outer box, so it will look nice on the shelf.) So far, we haven't had any issues with the episodes themselves getting stuck. Everything's been fabulous in that regard, too. Glad I took a risk and bought this show!

He watched the first couple episodes, and then nothing would play from the discs. Tried different players as well. All I wanted was to do was send it back and get it replaced for a set that worked. I mean that's $90.00 that I don't want to through away on nothing. Amazon will not replace this for me. And I am pretty upset about it. I am very ashamed to have done so much shopping on their website just to get stiffed like this.",1480809600,2,592,4.247787610619469

Or you might be surprised to know that Barney actually converses on the phone with Mr. McBebe as seen in the last 3 minutes of that episode--which until having seen this episode on dvd, I had never seen or in the 'BARNEYS SUIT episode, you will see Barney and Andy simulating a knife attack as Barney demonstrates his judo knowledge to Andy...lol

2646115,5,B000HWZ4IO,"Gave as a gift to my Uncle but I've enjoyed watching the series too. What's really nice about this DVD set is the commercials that are on there as special features because they're SO funny with Andy and Don Knotts and friends playing their characters as if it's just another episode, giving you the standard ""I'm in a fix"" setup or something and then out of the blue talking about some product like coffee or cereal like Andy's gone absolutely insane, and to watch the look on Don Knotts' face when that happens is priceless every time. Even if you've seen the episodes, it's more than well worth it to get this collection to see the funny commercials they did. It had me roaring with laughter. I about choked on my drink I was laughing so hard.",1412640000,9,745,4.445255474452555

2646136,5,B000HWZ4IO,"Who doesn't remember or adore ""The Andy Griffith Show""? I especially enjoy the first five seasons, when the characters are being developed. It starts with Opie rejecting the sweet and kindhearted Aunt Bee until she decides to leave. And Andy goes from being a true hick to a softened character, while Barney is.....well, Barney. Opie goes through a lot of growing pains, and Andy meets several girls, including a pair that are after Andy and Barney; one of them has the famous line, ""Hi, doll"", in a voice that will get you howling with laughter. I was so excited to find the complete collection. A must-have.",1410998400,,609,4.754716981132075
2646137,5,B000HWZ4IO,"Television programs are like food, everyone has their favorites.  I personally think The Andy Griffith Show is the finest television program of all time. Excellent storylines, richly drawn characters, and just the right amount humor vs. drama.  My best friend thinks I Love Lucy is the greatest, but I get tired of the ""women vs. men"" plot lines that seem to permeate almost every episode. TAGS has so much more to offer.  Highly recommend.",1410825600,2,440,4.918918918918919

It's nice to be able to travel back to a time when the world was a safer place to live. :-) Shows like this are pretty good company.  In my opinion,  the show was not nearly as good starting with the 6th season - after Barney Fife (Don Knotts) left the show. The earlier seasons are the best, to me.",1409961600,,426,4.3

It is impossible to do. I have spent a great deal of time when I should have purchased the entire collection sooner and enjoyed my time watching much sooner!

I converted the DVD discs to hard files which gives me greater flexibility in watching. I do think the DVD covers could be constructed differently to prevent DVD scratching.

2646277,5,B000HWZ4IO,"The shows are exactly as they were on the TV program while I was growing up! The Box and holders have wonderful pictures. Since I didn't want to take a chance on them being scratched by the cardboard slots, I put mine in some inexpensive thin paper/plastic sleeves to protect them and then just folded them up in each season. My whole family enjoyed the series.",1396742400,,361,4.484848484848484
2646278,5,B000HWZ4IO,"One of the major reasons this show's lasted this long in syndication and has garnered so much respect is because it has a lot more reality to it than many of the other shows from its era (Bachelor Father, The Donna Reed Show, and loads of others).

For example, competent people are the exception and not the rule in Mayberry, as is the case in the real world. Andy Taylor is one of the few competent/relatively sane people in Mayberry. In the real world, there are a lot more Barney Fifes than Andy Taylors.

If the creators of this series were interested in portraying reality, it was key for them not to make Sheriff Andy Taylor perfect. So they gave him at least one relatively major flaw: a sadistic, almost bullying, streak. From time to time, he treats Barney in a very sadistic manner. He teases Barney in a major way and seems to get a giant kick out of Barney's typical humiliated, angry reaction.

And speaking of reality, there's Barney's womanizing. Hilarious. And, once again, here is something that is not uncommon in the real world.

I wholeheartedly believe that it would have been an entirely different show if they had whitewashed the town of Mayberry and its inhabitants. And it would not have enjoyed the long run it's had and the respect it's garnered.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One more note. Everyone talks about the superb actors on this show, but it seems to me that Francis Bavier is one of the least talked about, at least in the circles I travel in. It seems to me she is the most underrated actor on the show and one of the most underrated actors of all-time, in any medium. Incapable of a false note.

I am currently working my way through the series and have been disappointed that some of the discs are not playing correctly. I am having to take out the discs and clean them and try again. Sometimes that helps, sometimes not. I have actually had to rely on Netflix as a backup to watch episodes that will not play correctly. These discs are brand spanking new and yet if you hold them up to the light, you can clearly see scratches on most of them. I had the same problem with the Wild Wild West DVD set. What's the deal? Why can't the people that release these things come up with a better system for protecting the discs? Oh well, I guess as long as people are shelling out the bucks for them, they will continue to distribute them as cheaply as possible. Buyer beware.",1390435200,6,934,4.252808988764045

Why should I have put my physical address first if it was going to arrive at my post office box? Anyway, the much anticipated DVD set finally arrived and my husband was thrilled.

Yes, compared to some boxed sets, it is a little flimsy, but I have had no problems with damaged discs. I know that Amazon's prices can, and do, fluctuate. When I first started looking into this set it was about 95.00. considering what you get, not a bad price. I held out though and got it for 60.99 plus tax. For me that came to 66.02. Divide that by the 40 discs you get that is about a 1.65 a disc. Or, at 249 episodes, about .26 per episode, with the movie and other few extras thrown in for free.

To sit back and watch well written television, where the characters care about one another and work together in a small town setting is truely entertaining.

The extras including - the ""pilot"" from the Danny Thomas Show was really funny - something I didn't remember ever seeing before.

2646447,5,B000HWZ4IO,"This is a fabulous set and for the money paid, it was well worth the dollar. I give it 5 stars for Amazons ability to run it on sale for a meager $ 64.00 with free delivery.  239 Episodes and a few extras to boot.  Included in this set were commercials and the movie Mayberry R.F.D.  No one gets tired of this awesome 8 year run series.  They just don't write them like this anymore.  The small complaint I have about this set is like everyone else has mentioned here.  The flimsy cardboard box the discs come in could have been put together in a nicer package.  However, if that was what it took to keep the price as affordable as it is here, then its a steal at what I paid.  Buyers get on board here when you see this on sale at Amazon and enjoy good old school TV shows like this one. This is classic TV at its best.",1376524800,,820,4.018518518518518

I had to return my set and the replacement set is doing the same exact thing, but only now with different episodes. There is no way I'm getting a fixed set if this has happening with random episodes with each set. Amazon should stop selling this defective set.",1376352000,26,392,4.24
2646450,5,B000HWZ4IO,I have seen the different reviews where some people are bashing the packaging. Personally I thought the package was adequate. each season comes in a cardboard sleeves with pockets for each season. Especially when you take into consideration that you can get all 8 seasons for $65 on Amazon who could ask for anything more. The works out to be about $8 a season. I have only scratched the surface of this set but so far the show looks and sounds great. Only could only imagine the number laughs you will get out of watching the entire run of the Andy Griffith Show. Over 106 hours of viewing for one very low price! For my money this set is a  great deal and a good chance to grab the entire series in one shot.,1376352000,2,710,4.298507462686567

And everything works great. And the Disc holders are just fine. It is one great TV show from the days past.
I see more and more when a Complete series deal is set up and put out.
The Disc holders tend to be bad and real cheap.
The Shield was the worst ever. Millions had to send the Box set back. And get a new one. And I was one.
The way the Disc holders were made. They would mess the disc up when you took the Disc out. And so on.

2646518,1,B000HWZ4IO,"Andy Griffith & Don Knotts are the perfect pair, and Knotts couldn't have been a better sidekick for Andy. I do, however recommend purchasing the seasons INDIVIDUALLY. Especially, if you want it to last for years and years. The Complete Series set is very cheaply made, hard to use, doesn't last very long, and some of the disks will be scratched before even removing the shrinkwrap. The individual sets are stored in their own case, and are organized neatly, with beautiful artwork. So, with that being said, 5 Stars for the show (A True Classic), 1 Star for Paramount! Paramount/CBS are getting very greedy, and even for the overbearing prices they want for flimsy boxsets, they will soon be out of business if they don't stop this. Andy, Barney, Opie, & Aunt Bea deserve better!",1364342400,23,781,4.792592592592593

2646520,1,B000HWZ4IO,"Before ordering my Complete series of Andy Griffith, I read several reviews pro and con. Most of the con reviews were older so I thought that maybe this manufacturer had worked out the kinks. But, just like the reviews, I have experienced the same problems. The discs came in unprotected in a cardboard folder. Some of the discs won't even play. The first few discs are plagued by syncronization problems. I'm not a happy camper.",1362787200,35,429,4.733333333333333
2646552,5,B000HWZ4IO,"I waited until I watched the entire series to review this product. It is fantastic, excellent price to boot. Even though the first 5 seasons were probably the best, because after Barney left Mayberry is just went downhill from there. Floyd the barber was pretty funny- the guy always seemed spaced-out, like he was constantly high off of marijuana!

Andy was a pretty comical character in season 1, then I gather that the producers told him to take it down a notch and give the comical lines to Don Knotts.

All in all, the first 5 seasons, black and white as it went to color in season 6, are the best. I would purchase this set just for the first 5 seasons!",1362528000,3,659,4.39344262295082

2646557,5,B000HWZ4IO,"The Andy Griffith Show is unique in a sense that it started out fun and had all the standard encounters and stories that most TV programs had but it never deteriorate or got so left field as to lose its appeal. Every show is entertaining and usually carries a message.

A lot of other programs spun off form the characters that played in this series. And you always think that Opie Taylor (Ronny Howard) is always young. Everyone knows that they issued Deputy Barney fife ""1960-1965"" (Don Knotts) one bullet that has seen a lot of action in his pocket. Too many people to name here.

This set is great.  The Box is sturdy that holds the individual season sets. I really don't like the way companies put the DVDs into sleeves where they get scratched though.

I like the extras and the addition of cross episodes from The Danny Thomas Show and Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., the Return to Mayberry Movie, and the sponsor shots that not a whole lot of people have seen.",1360540800,5,521,4.34020618556701

Beloved actor Andy Griffith dies in NC at age 86
By MARTHA WAGGONER | Associated Press - 49 mins ago...

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Griffith, 86, died Tuesday [July 3, 2012] at his home along the coast, said Dare County Sheriff Doug Doughtie.  ""Mr. Griffith passed away this morning at his home peacefully and has been laid to rest on his beloved Roanoke Island.""...

In a 2007 interview with The Associated Press, Griffith said he wasn't as wise as the sheriff, nor as nice. He described himself as having the qualities of one of his last roles, that of the cranky diner owner in ""Waitress,"" and also of his most manipulative character, from the 1957 movie ""A Face in the Crowd.""  ""But I guess you could say I created Andy Taylor,"" he said. ""Andy Taylor's the best part of my mind. The best part of me.""...

""His love of creating, the joy he took in it whether it was drama or comedy or his music, was inspiring to grow up around,"" [Ron] Howard said in a statement. ""The spirit he created on the set of 'The Andy Griffith Show' was joyful and professional all at once. It was an amazing environment.""...

""The Andy Griffith Show"" was a loving portrait of the town where few grew up but many wished they did -- a place where all foibles are forgiven and friendships are forever. Villains came through town and moved on, usually changed by their stay in Mayberry. ""That was all a credit to Griffith,"" said casting director Craig Fincannon, ""and Andy Griffith's the reason for that.""...

When asked in 2007 to name his favorite episodes, the ones atop Griffith's list were the shows that emphasized Knotts' character.  ""The second episode that we shot I knew Don should be funny and I should play straight for him,"" Griffith said. ""That opened up the whole series because I could play straight for everybody else. And I didn't have to be funny. I just let them be funny.""...

""Few people in this world will ever have more influence on our lives than Andy Griffith,"" [Brad] Paisley [who made a 2008 award winning music video with Andy Griffith] said in a statement. ""An actor who never looked like he was acting, a moral compass who saved as many souls as most preachers, and an entertainer who put smiles on more faces than almost anyone; this was as successful a life as is pretty much possible.""...

He[Griffith] was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts Hall of Fame in 1992...  More recently, Griffith won a Grammy in 1997 for his album of gospel music ""I Love to Tell the Story -- 25 Timeless Hymns.""...  In 2005, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the country's highest civilian honors....""

On this day of remembering a wonderful, complex man, I am both sad and grateful.  I thought I'd share these memories of Andy's life on Amazon.com.  So many people have bought this series and made heart-felt comments, I thought it would be appreciated.  Probably alot of people will be purchasing this series to remember Andy Griffith.",1341273600,11,3042,4.635009310986964

Andy was a great characcter, because he made mistakes and had to work through them. Barney was classic comedy, with a touch of humanity. Otis brought a feeling that we could be related.

(on sale)  Leave it to Beaver, same way, bought the first four seasons for over $100, now the entire collection sells for $99.  I'll still collect classic TV but I guess I'll need to be a little more patient in the future.",1339632000,3,642,4.316666666666666
2646707,5,B000HWZ4IO,"GREAT GREAT set. Bought it back in 2007 and watched every episode.  Maybe there is something wrong with me, but it did not bother me if 2 or 3 of the episodes did not show the extra 2 min footage................ Like the Darlin' singing. I bought it because I enjoy the show and wanted the laughs. NOT that important. The price is good for what you get, which is every episode.  To be honest, if several people had not mentioned it, I would not have know a few episodes were missing a min. or two. I didn't loose any sleep over it. The Darlin's get on my nerves anyway, and they weren't that funny..... As for WHERE ARE THE EXTRAS... people get over it. I think some people buy a damn move or in this case a box set for the extras. The series ended in 1968. They were not concerned about telling the future of adding extras to DVD which of course didn't exist then. I hope no one expected them to hunt down the living cast for interviews.  I guess if your wanting  10 hours of extras and the lost Darling's song you will just have to do without.  I am picky, and I did not notice anything wrong with the picture quality or the packaging. To be honest - this is one fine set, and some people, well you can't please.

It's great to have each episode in its entirety. PLUS, the pilot which aired on the Danny Thomas Show, and two other special episodes, including the Mayberry RFD movie, are included in the first season set. We were thrilled to realize that not only is each episode complete, but the set is really complete. I don't know why people have complained about the packaging. It seems fine to us, and actually stores the disks in a compact way. We're very happy and have many, many hours of Andy Griffith watching ahead of us.",1318204800,5,879,4.398773006134969

I've never stopped wanting to have an Aunt Bee or a dad like Andy.  After a stressful day, my husband and I watch an episode to unwind and relax before going to bed.  I still say things like, ""nothing's too good for the man what saved my life,"" or ""you beat everything, you know that!""  I love seeing all the Howard men - Rance, Ronnie and Clint.

2646731,5,B000HWZ4IO,"When this show, (THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, COMPLETE SERIES""), was on the air, we just about never watched it.  I remember tuning in -- just once or twice -- out of curiousity, but that's all.  Why?  It seemed SO corny...so full of simple, (if not stupid), ""country folk"".  No girls or women, (except older ""Aunt Bee""), that we knew of, to be role-models for my sister and I whilst we watched it.  Living in New York City -- even if not in Manhatten, but in Queens -- GLAMOUR was on our minds.  Being, (although not then knowing it), an ""Indigo"" person, ROYALTY was ALWAYS on at least my own mind.  WHY anyone would EVER watch a program like this was then totally beyond my understanding.  The people on ""THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW"" seemed to be 1960s people stuck in the country ways of the 1860s.  Yes, they had electricity, and cars, too -- but did they ever go to the LIBRARY?  (They probably didn't even HAVE a library in that forgotten, backwater town...or village!)  Stores?  An occasional roadway shows being put on in the high-school, (did thy HAVE a high-school?)  Formal (or even informal) dining rooms? Paved roads....running water?  Gas or electric stoves....not wood-burning ones?  Paved roads?  Running water?  It seemed to me that his was ""Cornsville USA"", and that the only person with a spark of intelligence living in it was Andy Griffith's sheriff.  (And I wondered why he didn't move away....?)

Well, Amazon has put the entire series on sale today...and on an impulse, I have bought it.  My niece tells me that at college, she was taught that all poor people are stupid, (which made me wonder a little bit about how Abraham Lincoln fitted into this equation....or our own ancestors, who came to North America with absolutely nothing but each other....)  I have heard stories about organizations which set up meetings for VERY rich and powerful people, at which, during the start of every conclave, a baby, (in EFFIGY), is burnt before the crowd....heralding the message, ""The End of Care"".  I have also heard stories about ""the Illuminated Ones"" wanting to get the population of Earth DOWN, from 6 billion to 160 thousand....so that, after 2012, we'll all be easier to control......

Well, shows like ""The Andy Griffith Show, Complete Series"" counter that sort of super-duper-elitist thinking.  I THINK....as I have not yet seen even three complete episodes.  I KNOW that shows like ""Father Knows Best"", ""The Donna Reed Show"", ""The Waltons"", and even ""Star Trek"", (and certainly, ""Alien Nation - The Series""), do.  It's possible that evepoor people can think of themselves as superiour....if they look down upon handicapped, older, drunk, fat, and other minority people.....

Happily, 'THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, COMPLETE SERIES"", remains near the top of Amazon's lists in it's categories.  Why?  Certainly NOT because those with DVD players WANT to return to a simplistic way of life....

No.  As Herbert W. Armstrong, an early televangelist once said, (and proved), everyone has a reason to be alive, and everyone should be RESPECTED for wanting to stay alive.  (Mr. Armstrong -- a very broadminded man -- said to a Jewish viewer, (who liked Mr. Armstrong's broadasts, but had trouble with so much use of the words ""Jesus"" and ""Christ"" in these programs, ""Just substitute ""God"" when I say those words).  So, I have resolved to watch 'THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, THE COMPLETE SERIES', and see why it was, and remains, so popular.

I suspect this show proves there is a COMMON humanity in EVERYONE.  If so, it should definitely be seen by as many people as possible.  Espcially those who go to meetings where the first thing they see is a playlet-tableau, showing ""the death of care"".

In these days when it seems we need ""care"" the most!

Before ordering, read other reviews and was hesitant to buy based on negative feedback about cardboard packaging that did not hold disks securely.

I like the packaging very much. I don't know why alot of people don't. The discs stay in the holder just fine. I like how each season folds out. I also like the design and art work. This set does not include descriptions of each episode like the individual seasons have. I just got the descriptions from online so I can look at them when I watch an episode.

2646753,3,B000HWZ4IO,"I bought the disks individually. Each was packaged in a separate disk. The cast and story lines were OK for what it was, though some stories were much better than others.

I must admit Aunt Bee really got on my nerves. Couldn't stand her high pitched voice and her stupidity.  Now Barney, he's OK, and he's funny, but his part in the show plays that he's an idiot, and I wished Andy would have really put him down a lot harder when he did dumb things, which is most of the time.  Instead, he let him get away with anything. We're still waiting for him to say the Declaration of Independence by himself plus it's a good thing the gold shipment wasn't real gold.

Andy's just a bit too nice to all the weirdos in Mayberry, especially ole Aunt Bee when she does stupid things. The freezer for instance, or her song writing, her insistence that Andy give his high school valedictorian address to Helen, duh,  or her attempt to play Lady Mayberry. Not good writing. Silly stuff.  I guess they kept her around because she's supposedly a good cook. Gee, she can make shrimp cocktail and pot roast. Like who can't? But I bought the set one by one years ago, and still watch it generally at night at bedtime. It's my absolute favorite to go to sleep with. Puts me out in 5 minutes.

Opie's the best actor on the show, though I did like the Darlings, especially the vocals by Charlene. No wonder Opie turned into a famous director, he was very good.  The additional cast members were OK for the parts they played, but I suppose they were all supposed to be a bit dim witted and they were pretty good at it. Howard was OK.  I liked him especially after they sent his mother off to Raleigh. I would like to see the end part where Andy and Helen got married, but I don't think that's available anywhere.  I looked.

I did once see a bit about Andy, Opie and Helen (they finally got married)and had a new baby. Opie was grown up.  I think it was from Mayberry RFD, but not sure because I never watched that show. Would like to have it though.",1265587200,2,2028,4.307894736842106

2646778,4,B000HWZ4IO,"I also love the show, and as a graphic designer, I like the visual look of the packaging, but the design was not thought out well at all regarding the tight squeeze of the DVD's into the pockets, leaving them very vulnerable to scratches.  Here's what I did; I bought a box of CD/DVD paper sleeves for about $5, (box of 50's) put each DVD into one, folded back and taped the bottom sides to the back of the sleeve, tore the pocket on the right side where the disc slides into and they all fit nicely into the slot and the DVD's are protective. Each season folded and fit back into the box, just a little more snuggly.  Yes it's a pain, but I just wanted to share my solution.  It really did work.",1237680000,32,696,4.140740740740741

I took off 1 star for poor packaging, but 4 stars for the series and organization of the discs.
I also own the ""I Love Lucy"" and ""Dick Van Dyke Show"" complete series. In my opinion, the ""I Love Lucy"" is the best. The packaging was better and there is a booklet describing all the episodes.

2646833,3,B000HWZ4IO,"Well, one good thing is that if you are angry because you bought the individual season DVD sets (like I did) and wished you waited to buy the complete series box set for the extras and corrections, you need not sweat it.  The missing epilogue and minutes to ""The Darlings Are Coming"" and the missing epilogue to ""Barney Mends a Broken Heart"" from season 3 were not restored to this set. The laugh tracks to a few episodes from season 4 have been restored, but that wasn't a big deal to me.

The ""extra extras"" you get from this series box set are available individually elsewhere if you look around.  The pilot ""Danny Meets Andy Griffith"" is available edited on the ""Make Room for Daddy"" 5th season DVD set.  The pilot included here is also edited.  You can also find ""Return to Mayberry"" on DVD online and the other bonus is the episode ""Opie Joins the Marines"" where Opie visits Gomer on ""Gomer Pyle USMC,"" which will be released in that series' second season set in a few months. I wish Paramount could have gathered some behind-the-scenes stuff or commentaries or interviews (the actors are not getting any younger and in just the past few years, many important TAGS people have died like Howard Morris and Don Knotts).  That would have made this set worth it, but nothing like that is included.

What bugs me the most, though, is the crummy packaging: Cardboard folders and pockets with cut-out photos on the characters printed on it.  At least make it the same as the individual sets with the plastic, easy-to-use holders and the bold and colorful illustrations.  It's a great series, I love the shows (even the color episodes), but if you have already bought the seasons and are wondering if the series set is worth it, I would vote, 'no.'  In fact, if you haven't bought anything from this series yet, I would still choose the indivdual seasons to this set.",1180742400,411,1865,4.6072507552870094

My only complaint is that the set doesn't have all of the commercials that are available *but, it IS all that are on the previous sets.* The package isn't as sturdy as it should be. The first 2 discs in EVERY set were loose when I received my box. And elas, in FINALLY having the laugh tracks on the above episodes restored .. there isn't the performance of salty dog. So, at this price it really is a bargain .. and I still feel that way after having already purchased each individual season. Simply a MUST BUY for any fan! Thank you kindly for your time and patience. :)",1180569600,6,779,4.1655629139072845
2646835,3,B000HWZ4IO,"Let me start out by saying I love the series, I bought all 8 seasons individually, and when it was released as a large box set I figured I would buy it and sell off my indivdual sets to save room in my DVD collection. I preordered the set and sold off all my individual sets.

My new set came in today, and I was thrilled to open the box, but once I opened it my thrill went away, This is by far the worst packaging of a DVD collection that I have ever seen. Each season is in a cardboard folded sleeve, and you slide the dvd into a cardboard slot, its cheap and flimsy and I am worried about the disks sliding in and out of these slots getting scratched, the individual season sleeves don't even fit nicely into the box. The whole box is a real mess when you look at it where the dvds slide in. and that is right out of the box from amazon. So if your thinking of upgrading your sets to this box set I would say keep what you got and don't upgrade, to the manufacture I would say the box set deserves better packaging than this. Most public domain packaging is better than this. MY review the show is a 5 the presentation/packaging is a 1.",1180569600,203,1140,4.04424778761062
