7812055,3,630152635X,"Any pleasure to be derived from this Voodoo demon movie--besides giggling at its general badness--is limited to just a handful of scenes surrounded by boring plot and sinful acting.  Watch with caution; probably only for the obscure 80s horror fanatics out therewhich I am, so I thought it was okay.

It takes a while for this movie to get to the pointor to get to anything that matters at all.  Opening shots long-windedly depict Voodoo rituals in Africa when something goes wrong.  Something that we obviously wouldn't get to see in the first five minutes.  But we get the idea that this something is summoned when chaotic POV shots give a nod to an Evil Dead demon.

Meanwhile in south Florida, a Miami cop (Wayne Crawford; Barracuda) with some drinking issues discovers that his wife (June Chadwick; Forbidden World) has a lesbian lover and he starts sleeping with his partner (Kay Lenz; House).  The editing is terrible, the acting is scarier than the movie, and none of the aforementioned aspects of this cop's life really matter at all with regard to the plot.

As for what little plot there is to discuss, it seems that a poor Nigerian community has brought their voodoo practices (and curses) across the Atlantic to Floridaand judging by the recent crime scenes, they brought their voodoo demon with them.  A local community leader, voodoo shaman and somehow wealthy African Studies professor (to my knowledge neither shaman nor professor are lucrative careers) altruistically appears to help our Miami cops ""track down"" this demonsort ofwell, not really.  You see, at first he finds them and says he wants to help.  Then he reveals that he really can't do any more than tell them the recent chain of murders are linked to a curse that followed his people from Nigeria.  No weaknesses, no origins, no mythology or folklorejust, yeah, a decapitating curse demon that somehow needs to be stopped.

In the first hour of this tragic low budget B-movie (or D-movie), our evil force is represented by POV shots, wind/telekinesis and a curved blade (like that of a khopesh, or sword).  We see heads, then we don't see heads, there's some blood where heads used to beit's all pretty weak.  But it'll make you grin.

This movie just needlessly drags.  You know what's an awesome B-movie idea?  A voodoo demon that hunts people down and chops off their heads because of some curse that goes entirely unexplained.  You know what's not a cool idea?  A movie about a south Florida detective whose wife is cheating on him with another woman.  This unambitious D-movie gives us both and, as a result of this plot beleaguered by our protagonist's personal crisis, this movie is only awesome for about 10 minutes.  Two of these brilliantly bad minutes feature the most frantic chainsaw shopping scene in film history.  A couple more minutes feature a bath tub filled with severed body parts and blood.

When we finally see our demon headhunter at the very end of the movie, we enjoy a silly latex monstrosity that looks more like the swamp hag from Legend (1985) wielding a sword than anything that makes me think of Africa or voodoo.  Our hero ends up saving his lovely partner in a voodoo demon sword versus chainsaw duel.  Then movie is just ""over"" after about 90 seconds of decent action and fun.  No explanation, no catharsis, no finishing the tale of the Nigerian voodoo curse demonwe just assume everything's fine after some cheesy chainsaw dismemberment.

Beyond that there's a nudity-free shower scene and little gore, no good reason for not showing us the monster earlier or more often, and pretty much nothing in the way of atmosphere or scares.

Any pleasure to be derived from this movie--besides giggling at its general badness, which is often just as annoying than funny--is limited to just a handful of scenes surrounded by boring plot and sinful acting.  Watch with caution; probably only for the obscure 80s horror fanatics out therewhich I am, so I thought it was okay.",1460246400,,3980,4.836041358936485

Headhunter (1988) *1/2
D: Francis Schaeffer
C: Wayne Crawford, Kay Lenz, Steve Kanaly, June Chadwick, John Fatooh
P: Two police detectives in Miami are assigned to a series of bizarre murders involving Nigerian refugees who are being decapitated by what they claim to be a Headhunter, a shape shifting demon that kills those that have betrayed their Nigerian origins or anyone that stands in the demon's way.

With a story that involves lesbianism, possession, racism, voodoo, a demon that chops off people's heads and a police detective that goes mano a mano with said demon while wielding a chainsaw, you would think that Headhunter had all the ingredients to be an interesting film. Unfortunately, the film puts most of its emphasis on a police procedural story, involving Crawford and Lenz, that ends up being the film's least interesting aspect.

In one ingenious scene, one of the refugee's thinks that the key to their survival is converting to Christianity. While being Baptized, said refugee is decapitated. In another clever move, when Crawford finds out the key to killing off the demon is to chop it up limb for limb, instead of facing off against the demon with his trusty gun (as is the case with most horror films), he runs to the hardware store to buy a chainsaw, so he can cut up said demon limb for limb.

What I'm getting at, is that Headhunter has some interesting story elements and some clever ideas, but there all lost in translation as they take a backseat to a boring procedural. Headhunter has the type of villain that is franchise worthy and a story that lends itself to something that could have been a cult classic, but the overall script loses hindsight of what could have made this a unique film and in the process Headhunter became just another forgettable direct to video film that sat on store shelves.

7812057,4,630152635X,I have this little gem on vhs and would love to get it on dvd. This would be an instant horror classic if they would just release it on dvd. This movie is about an ancient demon who cuts off peoples heads. Kay Lenz is a seasoned actress and with her co actor make this one of the most entertaining horror movies of the 90's. I would say it's kind of a mix between Evil Dead and Army of Darkness but without the puppet animation of the latter. The demon looks really terrifying and realistic although I would still classify this as a B movie I think younger fans of horror would appreciate this a lot.,1300924800,,600,4.181034482758621
7812058,2,630152635X,"I guess the best part of this movie was getting to mock it through-out the entire thing! Wasn't the worst horror flick ever seen, but pretty close to it.  Bored from the beginning. I must admit that I am glad I watched it just for the experience!",1137110400,,246,4.23404255319149
7812059,3,630152635X,"for a B movie, it really wasn't bad, reminded me of some of the 80's spook flicks that came out when i was in high school... BUT i REALLY enjoyed the soundtrack !!! that guitar-ish sounding piece that is thru out the film is really awesome...  i never heard of the composer BUT was wondering if there was a soundtrack available ???",1021852800,,331,4.338709677419355
7812060,4,630152635X,I actually saw this movie at a film festival in new york...It's set up as a regular b movie with the scares and the chills but there's a real twist that kept me guessing. I can't wait to see this movie in the comfort of my own home.... with the lights off.,1019692800,,256,3.9423076923076925
7812061,5,630152635X,This movie is a very good saturday night movie to watch with a date.  This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat one second and has you chuckling the next. A B-movie that I highly recommend.,1019260800,2,193,4.078947368421052
7812062,4,630152635X,Low budget movie that keeps us guessing throughout!  You're never quite sure what's gonna happen next.  I enjoyed watching it with my girlfriend in the dark!  A couple of really scary moments!  Looks a bit like a documentary which just adds to the realism.  Filmakers obviously had a lot of fun making it.  I would recommend this movie!,1018656000,,336,4.706896551724138
