I was ASTONISHED by Nilsen and Fuentes voices, most especially! I understand the other 2, are well established in the music field, WOW! Thanks",1328140800,3,305,4.666666666666667

I wish that there was a dubbed version for all of us English speakers, but even without knowing what they said between songs, this is a fantastic DVD.  And the harmony between these four guys is not to be missed.  Unfortunately I don't think we will see new albums by the four together any time soon.",1284854400,6,381,4.178082191780822
8277288,5,B001AG58H8,"It's a shame if this is no longer available. I stumbled upon their youtube talk show version of Hallelujah one day and was blown away.
I bought the DVD based on that and other clips that have made their way to the web.
It's now one of the best concert DVD's I own.

There are just no weakness to the performances. Top notch singing and the harmonies are all one could ask for. Great cover versions that I would much rather listen to than the originals.

With that said, this DVD didn't play on all my DVD players as I believe it is not regioned for USA specifically. A so-called CODE FREE player should have no problem. Hopefully one day the motion picture companies will eventually do away with that silliness once and for all.",1277942400,7,728,4.385185185185185
8277289,5,B001AG58H8,"I have to say that this compilation of music by four of Norway's best musicians is a truly wonderous musical adventure. I have about worn my copy out, so I quit playing it until I can find a back-up copy. This item is discontinued by the manufacturer, so I want to preserve my copy!!

Not only do you get wonderfully done covers of well known songs, but also several original works by each one of the guys.  The DVD is split between two concert dates. During the April 2006 date we are treated to a variety of well known songs by each artist in addition to the covers. The acoustic sets and the interplay between these musicians is magic.  I find myself holding my breath along with them as they somehow manage to hold notes longer than should be humanly possible, and keeping it all on key!

Kurt Nilsen and Alejandro Fuents are still relative ""babies"" in the performing world at this point, but Espen and Askil jump in and offer support when needed, resulting in some wonderful performances and true camaraderie.  We are also treated to the now well known rendition of Hallelujah, the guys acoustic version of Leonard Cohen's beautiful song. This is the song that started it all, or so I have read. This makes perfect sense and also a great title for their first work together.

In the second portion we go along to the October 2006 concert at the Oslo Spektrum. Espen Lind on his ""Million Miles Away""-Brilliant! Askil Holm in Springsteen's ""The River""-Wonderful.  Alejando Fuents and his ""Stars""-Breathless.  Kurt Nilsen's ""My Street""-There are no words.

We also get the matchless treat of five favorite Norwegian songs. The joy and passion this group shows in their own special heritage is contagious. I find myself singing along each time I watch this little jewel.  If you own it, take care of it.  If you don't and find it somewhere to purchase, do so!  It is worth every penny :-)",1246320000,14,1889,4.63963963963964
