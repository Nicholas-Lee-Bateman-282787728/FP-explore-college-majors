This has a male/female team figure skaters showing a bunch of people, a teenage girl wannabe figure skater, a tween wannabe hockey player, a wannabe skate racer, a young boy, young girl & father who had never been on the ice.

The dialog is corny, but cute, very relaxed, not bad. Judging by the outfits & makeup, I'd say this was done in the mid to late 80s.

There is a lot of cut to scenes of the figure skater & other professional skaters on different kinds of skating programs.

You learn how to stand, fall (don't use your arms, use your butt), stand back up, hard stop (slid one foot sideways), turning, gliding forward or backwards.

The figure skaters have their coach come out & hand out badges & flowers when the group is done & introduce various clips of performances using the techniques they teach.

I did learn a lot, though I wish there was more content & less performance clips. Nothing can take the place of practice or a coach, but this was a cute, good basic teaching video that had a good pace.",1180137600,,1190,4.290178571428571

 For a beginner the title is very misleading. I cant express how disappointed I am in this video.

If the video were $2, I would feel as though I had been ripped off.

A complete Instructional video for beginners to advance is part of the title wording.

Whoever wrote that was on drugs. Big time..........It defies imagination as to why anyone could think such skills could be observed or learnt using this video. If I haven't been explicit enough that is my fault. Of course I may be wrong.

 Buy the video and see for yourself.",1150416000,,608,4.522935779816514
