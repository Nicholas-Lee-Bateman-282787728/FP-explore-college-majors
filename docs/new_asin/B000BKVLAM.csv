2423329,2,B000BKVLAM,"It was great to learn why Clint Eastwood is famous.  However, this documentary was gushy.  With the exception of mentioning some of his flops, you would think the man walks on water after seeing this.

Why not take a more critical look at his love life?  People ridicule Elizabeth Taylor, but nobody says anything about Clint having four different wives.  In fact, this work suggests that Clint usually found a girlfriend before leaving a wife.  People dawg Bill Clinton, but this work proves that Eastwood is a womanizer too.  In this piece, he questions whether he was the best father, but he never admits that maybe he was a poor husband as well.

Throughout the work, interviewees call Eastwood egalitarian.  Roger Ebert once noted that the Matrix sequels had many black and female actors, though the films weren't about race and gender, per se.  Similarly, this documentary shows how Clint works with many African Americans and Jewish people,  I remember that either the NAACP or Soul Train gave Eastwood an award for his diverse film casts once, but the documentary doesn't bring that up.  Still, it's obvious to the viewer.  I appreciate Eastwood's commitment to diversity, even while I disapprove of his political affiliation.

This documentary was 90 minutes, rather than Biography's usual of 60.  Eastwood fans may love this.  However, it lasted way too long for me.  I didn't really need a rundown of each and every one of his films.  Though this was released in 2005, the work never mentions ""Million Dollar Baby,"" the critically acclaimed film he created in 2004.",1150156800,,1576,4.927756653992396

8088442,4,B000BKVLAM,"If you are a big Clint Eastwood fan like me this is a great DVD about his life to date.  However, it is very biased in favor of him.  It says nothing negative about how he has been married so many times people have lost count.  It does not talk much about the issues with Sandra Locke that she brought up in her book.  It is a good buy for anyone who wants to know more about him.",1261872000,,380,3.8333333333333335
