8094781,5,B000BZ8MYU,"I bought the DVD at a Randy Stonehill concert where I thought Randy's performance couldn't be beat. But the DVD with Phil Keagy showed me how wrong I could be. The only thing better than Randy's acoustic tunes is Randy's acoustic with Phil's electric guitar.

Coming to the Lord late in life meant I missed close to 30 years of Randy, Phil and Larry Norman so I am really enjoying the new discovery of ""My Generation's"" Christian music.

We are especially fortunate at our church to have a special relationship with Randy. We are a half hour south of where Randy grew up and when has some free time while visiting home he will play a couple of Sunday services for us. His last appearance his nomination to the Christian Music Hall of Fame was announced. Obviously he would have my vote.",1173052800,,786,4.528169014084507
8094782,5,B000BZ8MYU,"Watching Phil perform live in solo numbers is amazing. I'd never seen Randy Stonehill, but he is truly an entertainer. The numbers they performed together were inspiring. I could watch them every night.",1154649600,,202,5.151515151515151
8094783,4,B000BZ8MYU,"Randy Stonehill and Phil Keaggy are pioneers in Contemporary Christian Music.  They both have been performing for more than 30 years.  Having become friends along the way, they have performed on each other's recordings, producing some memorable duets.

This concert captures them performing some of them--including out-of-print material and a couple of never recorded songs.  They perform separate sets and then join together for five songs at the end.

Phil Keaggy opens the DVD with outstanding acoustic performances of ""The True Believers,"" ""Salvation Army Band"" and ""The Wind and the Wheat.""  If you have not seen Keaggy perform by himself recently, prepare to be amazed.  He uses recording equipment that he controls with his feet to continually create loops, which make for layers of sound.  You must see it on DVD to fully appreciate it.  He creates unimaginable sounds.  His guitar playing should be considered one of the man-made wonders of the world.

Randy Stonehill opens with ""Hand of God"" from 1998's Thirst and follows with a new song, ""Spirit Walk.""  The latter is classic Stonehill--a gritty perfomance carried by a blues riff that includes a conversation with the devil.  He also does a stellar rendering of one of the best songs on Thirst, the moving ""Angels' Wings.""

Randy's songwriting is at times reminiscent of the late Mark Heard.  It's been underrated for too long.  Give the edge to Phil for doing what few can do with a guitar but to Stonehill for relaying relevant stories and experiences through his lyrics.  He ends ""Spirit Walk"" singing that he hopes that his thoughts have been useful.

They always have been, with the possible exception (I say this jokingly) of when he runs wild with his humor, as he does on the next song.  On ""Shut de Do'"" Stonehill gives free reign to his zany side.  In a world of sobering realities, it provides some much-needed humor.

One of the highlights is the duet that was originally recorded to support the work of Compassion International.  It's poignant lyrics and beautiful chords make ""Who Will Save the Children?"" a classic.  ""Shades of Green,"" the Celtic-flavored instrumental performed by Keaggy, is another standout.  If you did not see him standing alone with his guitar, you might believe that he was playing with a band.  He weaves a tapestry of sound fitting for an Irish song.

Keaggy does not pick up his electric guitar until near the end when the duo perform ""Keep Me Runnin'"" and ""Sunday's Child.""  The CD ends with the encore song, ""Old Clothes.""  It's sung and played tenderly by Stonehill with Keaggy giving an understated performance on electric guitar.

The DVD and CD content differ slightly.  The DVD contains three songs plus one bonus song (""Chalice"") not found on the CD.  The CD contains two songs, including a beautiful version of George Harrison's ""Here Comes the Sun,"" that are not on the DVD.  As far as I know, this is the first time that Keaggy has recorded the Beatles song.  The beauty and nostalgia is enough to bring tears to your eyes.  It's too bad that it's not on the DVD, but it's great to have it on the CD.

One of the surprises seen on the DVD is the number of older adults in the crowd.  They and the rest of the crowd are an appreciative and enthusiastic group, which adds to the feel of the event.

Give Bob Kilpatrick, who was at the helm on Stonehill's last recording (Edge of the World 2002), credit for producing this memorable and enjoyable performance.",1151020800,2,3472,4.804054054054054
8094784,5,B000BZ8MYU,"This is just simply a delightful concert!  Musically, it is very simplistic without a backing band but who needs one when you've got Keaggy?  The man is amazing, and I take back the word ""simplistic"".  What Keaggy does by himself seems humanly impossible.  It must be seen to be believed.

Both Stonehill and Keaggy are very relaxed and seem to be enjoying themselves immensely.  The concert is on behalf of Compassion International and while it has its Keaggy ""wow"" moments and Stonehill zany moments, it still comes across with meaning and ministry.  It is obvious that Phil and Randy really respect each other and are truly long-time friends.

If I had to use just one word to describe this concert, it would be ""joy"".  It is a joy to watch these two talented and humble individuals putting their hearts into these performances.  My whole family was glued to the set from start to finish.  Part of time we were shaking our heads not quite believing what Keaggy was doing, part of the time laughing at Stonehill and then at other times seriously considering the powerful and challenging lyrics.

This is HIGHLY recommended.  I also recommend the audio version of the concert because it includes a Keaggy cover of George Harrison's ""Here Comes the Sun"".

Both the DVD and CD include a ""new"" Stonehill tune called ""Spirit Walk"" which is sure to be of interest to any Stonehill fan.

In my opinion, this is a ""can't miss"" for any Stonehill or Keaggy fan.

8094785,5,B000BZ8MYU,"After being a fan of both these men for nearly the entire length of their careers, it is without a doubt a joy and a pleasure to see them together on the same stage.  I have seen both of them live and they have incredible shows, but to see them together, well I don't think it gets any better than that. I only wish that the DVD would have been longer.  The bloopers and out takes are just plain funny.  Randy Stonehill continues his insane on stage presence and pretty much has Phil laughing constantly.  This is a must DVD for any Phil Keaggy or Randy Stonehill fan, and if your are not you should be.",1141862400,4,603,4.172413793103448
