3546168,5,B001E6JC3A,this is one of the best shows on TV. makes me want to join DEA and help them. maybe someday we will see the difference made by them. i wonder if the good work they are doing is being done throughout every city that has DEA. and cities like mine we have never heard or seen of the DEA around here. but they would be just as well finding people to start at the bottom in the little cities.  does anyone know when season 2 new jersey is going to be released?,1266019200,,455,3.9456521739130435

3546170,5,B001E6JC3A,"This is a 2-disc DVD set of Spike TV's DEA, a real COPS like show where camera's follow real law officers on the job. This show differs from COPS in that it follows a set group of individuals from the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration), Group 14, as they try to stop Drug trafficking by targeting small drug dealer's for leads that will take them to the top dogs all in the set location of Detroit. This set contains the following six hour long episodes:

Season 1, Ep 1: DEA vs. Heroin Kingpin - The DEA receives help from a drug trafficker that was a turned informant, to get DEA agents into Detroit's drug underworld scene.
Aired: 4/2/2008

Ep 2: Deadly Chase - The DEA go on a deadly standoff with two drug dealers and an escaped bank robber who stop at nothing to leave Detroit.
Aired: 4/9/2008

Ep 3: Operation Pill Grinder - The DEA joined with Group 14, go on a citywide operation that forces them to go on eight simultaneous raids on the streets of Detroit.
Aired: 4/16/2008

Ep 4: Up the Ladder - Group 14 stages a group of raids that target drug rings.
Aired: 4/23/2008

Ep 5: Deep Cover - A confidential informant and a special agent with the DEA go undercover to infiltrate an ecstasy drug ring.
Aired: 4/30/2008

Ep 6: Marijuana Grow House - Group 14 goes on a citywide operation to shutdown grow houses that are near local schools.
Aired: 5/7/2008

The show is shot in widescreen.

Spike TV has been growing since UFC took off and I find this show one of the best new additions to their lineup. This first season took place in Detroit but every season they plan to move and focus on a different group of DEA officers which finds season 2 moving to 'Tony Soprano's' own New Jersey where Group 56 (said ""Five-Six"") tackles the drug world and tries to clean up the streets. In my opinion these shows are done better than most live action series and I find the second season so far, especially, to be more adrenaline fueled than the more recent seasons of 24. (In fact I was surprised to learn that a thirteen episode cop drama series entitled DEA, based on the DEA's exploits, had been produced in 1990 but apparently never took off and was way before it's time. Just as well now that we have this awesome reality series based on the real guys).

I highly recommend this show to anyone who either loves the Cop Camera based documentaries, loves action and good entertaining television, or even for those who like cop or criminal based dramas to give a try. 5 stars, I'm glad for the number of episodes that this set is only 19.99 and I can't wait for the second season on DVD and it's not even done airing yet as I write this. If your not sure if this is for you check out your listings to catch the new season on Spike TV and give it a try.",1234828800,8,2756,4.3671875
