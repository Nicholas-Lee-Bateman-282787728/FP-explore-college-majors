2615238,3,B000GNOGUG,"I have used the program but I'm not very impressed compared with others I purchased. Not for a beginner.

I did receive my dvd in a timely fashion.",1171929600,4,147,4.25
2615239,4,B000GNOGUG,"This DVD features instructor Meghan White leading 15 different customized core routines.  Some of the routines centered around traditional crunches, whereas others are Pilates-based, sometimes incorporating equipment such as a stability ball and dumbbells.  The Main Menu is set up as follows:

Core Basics
Core Challenge
...More for Your Core!

Core Basics provides beginner level workouts.  Although Meghan goes slower here and does offer form pointers, I don't think she gives enough instruction to make these workouts appropriate for someone brand-new to Pilates.  However, this section would probably work well for those who have some prior familiarity with Pilates but have limited flexibility.  Here is the Core Basics menu, with brief descriptions added by me:

*Basic Abs (5 Min.)--basic and oblique crunches, keeping feet on the floor
*Strong Abs (5 Min.)--basic crunches, crunches w/legs raised, pulses, knees in and up, oblique work, unique side move
PILATES BASED CORE WORKOUTS (modified for beginners)
*Legs & Glutes (11 Min.)--modified versions of exercises such as the roll-up, rolling like a ball, side kicks, etc.
*Arms & Back (8 Min.)--modified versions of the hundred, roll-up, spine stretch forward, swan prep, swimming, scapular lift, and plank work
*Pilates Abs (11 Min.)--modified version of hundred, rolling like a ball, single and double leg stretch, scissors, criss-cross, single leg teaser, and seal

The Core Challenge menu is set up similarly to the Basics menu above, and the exercises are similar as well, but in an unmodified and more challenging form.  Here is the Core Challenge menu, with brief descriptions added by me:

*Advanced Abs (5 Min.)--basic crunch, oblique reaches, pulses, transverse crunch, transverse w/twist, knees in and out (lower than in basic program)
*Stronger Abs (5 Min.)--basic crunch, crunch w/leg lift, crunch w/1 leg in and out, crunch w/1 leg up and down, hip lifts, bicycle
PILATES BASED CORE WORKOUTS
*Abs, Legs & Glutes (15 Min.)--there are two separate segments here, a 4-minute abs workout with the hundred, rolling like a ball, double leg lowers, and criss-cross, and  an 11-minute legs/glutes segment with the roll-up, leg circles, the saw, single leg kicks, a side kick series, and leg lifts on all 4s
*Abs, Arms & Back (15 Min.)--this was also two separate segments, a 9-minute abs portion with the hundred, rolling like a ball, single and double leg stretch, scissors, double leg lowers, torso twists, teaser, and seal, and then a 6.5 minute arms and back portion with the hundred, roll-up, spine stretch forward, a series of back work (swan, swimming, scapular lifts), and leg lifts on all 4s

Finally, the ...More For Your Core! menu contains some more challenging workouts that include use of equipment as described below.

*Abs with Ring, Arms & Back, Stretch (15 Min.)--tough little segment using a fitness ring for the teaser and double leg stretch; followed by the same arms and back segment in the Core Challenge section and Stretch section with both reclined and seated stretches (actual time 17 minutes)
*Abs with Weights, Legs & Glutes (20 Min.)--starts with a 4-minute Pilates matwork flow and moves into a second 4-minute segment using a dumbbell for some unique moves such as side plank, partial roll-down, reverse curls w/weight under knees, and double leg stretch w/weight in hands; finishes with the same legs and glutes segment in the Core Challenge section
*Pilates Core and Stretch (30 Min.)--combines the 9-minute abs, 11-minute legs and glutes, 7-minute arms and back (all from the Core Challenge section) with the 3-minute stretch for a full 30-minute workout
CORE ABS
*Stability Ball (4 Min.)--nice short segment on the stability ball: roll-ups holding the ball in your hands, oblique work and teasers with feet on the ball, and double leg stretch holding the ball overhead
*Weighted Ball (4 Min.)--nice short segment using a small medicine ball:  holding the ball between your feet for the hundred, hip lifts, rolling with a twist, and transverse crunch

Overall, this is a nice DVD with a good variety of abs routines.  I did find the sequencing to be a bit strange: for example, the abs segment with ring starts off with a teaser variation, but then when you get to the arms & back segment, you begin with the hundred, usually the starting point for most Pilates routines (and sometimes the hundred is actually performed twice in the same routine here!). I would've preferred if all of the individual segments were listed in one menu where I could mix and match rather than having to choose one of the pre-formatted workouts on the menus.  However, for someone who likes both traditional core work and Pilates and who is looking for a wide variety of workout options, this DVD is likely to fit the bill.",1171324800,34,4803,5.120204603580563
2615240,4,B000GNOGUG,"I have been using workout videos for ages, and it's hard to find one that is effective and not boring. I have a ton of old VHS and even some of the newer DVDs that haven't been used in years.  I have to say that I LOVE Perfect Core. I've only been using it a short time and I already see a difference.  My abs are stronger and I love that I can pick the amount of time to work out. The trainer is great. This workout will stay in active rotation for quite awhile.",1160438400,10,463,3.863157894736842
2615241,5,B000GNOGUG,"I love this DVD! It offers a number of different routines which keeps the exercises new and exciting...AND it targets different muscles. So far, I can really see results. My muscles have stretched for a longer leaner look and I feel stronger and more energized. The instructor is very encouraging and makes you feel confident! Oh, and my husband loves it too.",1160352000,10,359,4.806451612903226
2615242,5,B000GNOGUG,Perfect Core turned out to be exactly what I was looking for in an exercise-at-home DVD.  I wanted to continue some of the fundamentals that my personal trainer at my gym taught me (during the 1 week I had him :) and do them at home.  This DVD was perfect for that and it allowed me to control the length of my workouts which is really important for my schedule since I'm a working mother. The core blast and ab challenge segments are flattening my stomach and tightening my abs! Get this one!,1160092800,15,493,4.290322580645161
2615243,5,B000GNOGUG,This is another good ab video from Meghan that has some more ab workouts that work very well and also helps work on other things.,1291852800,,129,4.2
2615244,5,B000GNOGUG,"This works really well if you want to focus on getting strength in you core/ab region with its mixture of some regular ab workouts and also things based on Pilates.  Like her other DVD I have, she makes things fun and really gives you a good workout.

This one has a nice beginner level section to work with as a start and it is very helpful if you are a beginner (I have done some Pilates, but still beginner for the most part.)  Though I am progressing I like the first level on some days.  Each of the first two levels has a couple of good straight forward ab workouts of 5 minutes or so.

I really enjoy her Sculpt and Tone DVD and combined with with, really have alot of fun things to work on my abs and use Pilates also.",1282780800,,726,4.084507042253521
2615245,3,B000GNOGUG,The teacher is good and very helpful for especially beginners. However if you are looking for a thorough ABS workout I would go for Volume 1. It is great mild exercise programs for a day where you don't want to break the big sweat out.,1280880000,,235,4.2444444444444445
2615246,5,B000GNOGUG,"This is another great ab workout DVD, with the addition of having some more core training and training for different parts of your body.  The core training, as the name implies, works on the ab area with and other areas.  These are pilates style type exercises.

There are also a few just straight ab exercises to work through for the times you want to just work on the abs.

The More For Your Core has longer things to work with and adds some extra items such as weights.

The few ab exercises alone, even disregarding the other exercises, are worth having.  The other items really add to the value of the DVD.",1276041600,,611,4.410714285714286
2615247,5,B000GNOGUG,These are the best work outs I have come across. do these to feel the burn.,1264291200,,75,3.75
2615248,5,B000GNOGUG,This DVD is perfect for the beginner or intermediately fit and for those with limited time.  I highly recommended it.,1252195200,,117,4.85
2615249,5,B000GNOGUG,"This one helps develop you core (abs) then also adds other things to help target other areas to tone and strengthen.

I have rotated some of the exercises into my workouts to get some additional ab work and also have the extra bonus of toning up other areas.

Enough traditional exercises (a few) to use solely as an ab DVD, which is worthwhile in itself due to the selection, with even more.

Very good.",1243468800,,404,4.4324324324324325
2615250,5,B000GNOGUG,"Nice combination of various ab exercises, some more tradtional and some pilates mixed in.  Nice additions and change-ups from her other DVD to give you more ab options.",1240531200,,168,5.0
2615251,5,B000GNOGUG,"This DVD has a nice mix of Pilates styled core workouts and some traditional ab workouts.  The ab work is about 5 minutes each, perfect as an add-on to whatever else you're doing.  The core workouts range from 15 to 30 minutes.",1239062400,,227,4.380952380952381
2615252,5,B000GNOGUG,"I really like the first Perfect Abs.  This one is also very good and really works out your Abs well, the four more traditional Ab workouts are well worth it, and she shakes it up more by using some Pilates exercises in other routines.  The modified Pilates/Abs workouts on the Basics level taught me the moves and gave me a good workout and also have helped with more general toning and strength.",1238889600,,396,4.486111111111111
2615253,5,B000GNOGUG,"I found this to be a good product.  There's 3 sections - Core Basics (this is beginner level), Core Challenge (this is an intermediate level), and More for Your Core (this is sort of a bonus section with routines using props and also a 30 min mat routine).  Each level has core routines and 5 minute ab routines.  The instruction and routines are pretty straight forward so you won't have any trouble getting right into it.  The 3 levels and variety of routines makes this a good DVD for me.",1236816000,,491,4.4222222222222225
2615254,4,B000GNOGUG,"the workouts are nice, but most time it's legs/arms/butt workout. It has a little bit of abs workout, but it lasts 5 minutes each. Exercises for abs are good, but I would like to have abs workout (not legs or arms) when I buy video for abs.",1235520000,,240,4.127659574468085
2615255,5,B000GNOGUG,"I have been using the other DVD in this series and it has worked well so I decided to pick up another one since I liked the instructor.

In this one she is just as good with a series of over a dozen exercies that include 4 nice short ab routines, plus additional routines that are pilates based.  I had not really done pilates before so the sections in the beginning that help target Legs & Glutes, Arms & Back and the Abs that had modified pilates moves was a big plus.  I have started working on the more advanced section and it is coming along.  I have not really worked through the bonus section yet, but it looks interesting with the additon of some weights and ball.

Provides alot of workouts on one DVD that target your core and also material to help tone other areas if you want to.",1231200000,,791,4.211920529801325
2615256,5,B000GNOGUG,"Three sections of Pilates core and traditional Abs workouts are the equivalent of a beginner, intermediate and bonus section of slightly more intense work.  The instructor does a nice job of giving you an effective core workout ranging from 10-30 minutes with moves based on the Pilates mat workout.  The 5 minute ab workouts hit every part of your abs and if you do these regularly you will see results.",1229040000,2,404,4.757142857142857
2615257,5,B000GNOGUG,"This DVD is a nice mix of Pilates styled ""core"" workouts and 5 minute straight forward ab workouts.  The Pilates sections are mostly 10-20 minute routines with each one focusing on different areas.  There's also a sort of bonus section called More for Your Core that has a half hour Pilates and stretching workout and some 15-20 minute routines that use a Pilates ring, hand weights and a stability ball.",1226966400,3,404,4.757142857142857
2615258,5,B000GNOGUG,"Some more ab routines from Meghan White that I really enjoy.

A few routines are designed just to focus on the abs, while others branch out to help other areas such as my arms.

The few routines using various items such as weights is a nice touch, but even if you do not have any of those things there is still a good selection of routines which makes it worthwhile.",1221609600,2,366,4.214285714285714
2615259,4,B000GNOGUG,"Instructor Meghan White does a better job of training what I need trained in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Perfect-Abs/dp/B000B5XPFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Perfect Abs</a>. However, having said that, this is a good beginner to intermediate ""core"" trainer that will wear you out. If you're severely overweight start elsewhere - this DVD will discourage you. Also, to do the full DVD you'll need to own certain items: fitness ring, stability ball and weighted ball. You'll want a mat for the basics.

I can complete the ""basic"" five minute abs routines but just barely, and I am fairly physically fit for a 37-year-old male. The 15 minute routines are not much of a challenge because they cover several different muscle groups.

I have not done the more advanced routines because they require items that I do not own items such as a weighted ball and a fitness ring.",1203724800,6,913,5.514285714285714
2615260,5,B000GNOGUG,"This is not for those who aren't serious about sculpting their waistline. It's given me shape to my flabby waist within 2 weeks! (I'm 37 and a mother of 4).  I actually see a six-pack taking shape.  I love that she works the obliques and the back...usually underworked or altogether neglected.  I like the progressive challenge of the different workouts and the routines are by NO means boring. This program strengthens your entire mid-section and you WILL see results if you'll commit the time and (as the drill sergeants use to say back in the day) ""dont cheat your body""! This is a MUST HAVE.",1201564800,5,595,4.647619047619048
2615261,5,B000GNOGUG,"I have only done this video a couple of times, but my husband does it religiously & loves it!  We are only able to do about 15 minutes of the core abs b/c it's pretty tough but a great workout that you can keep building on!",1180483200,3,223,3.847826086956522
2615262,3,B000GNOGUG,"To be able to fully use everything on the DVD, you'll need a Pilates ring, a small Pilates ball, hand weights, a stability ball, and a mat, which is almost 50% more equipment than I have or am willing to spend more money and space on.

With the exception of a few variations of standard floor crunches, almost ALL of the exercises are standard Pilates floorwork and best suited for intermediate/advanced exercisers. There's not much here for the true beginner, the overweight, or the older exerciser.

Workouts range from 4 minutes to 30 minutes and unlike quite a few other DVDs of its type, it's all presented in a bland style that borders on the monotonous.

In the end, I traded it in to my local used DVD store. There are better DVDs out there for working your core that require less equipment or none at all. For the beginner who wants a Pilates-style workout, I'd recommend something like Pilates for Dummies, Pilates for Everybody, or Pilates for Inflexible People.",1178409600,38,973,4.711764705882353
8133423,5,B000GNOGUG,A quick and effective ab workout.  This one is a gift.  But I've been using these 5 min routines for 2 years.  Love them!!!!!,1496966400,,125,4.125
8133424,4,B000GNOGUG,Nice exercises. I love that the exercises are only 5 minutes long.,1489017600,,66,4.583333333333333

8133427,5,B000GNOGUG,"I love doing the 5 min segments about an hour after dinner (I do cardio in the mornings). I won't break a sweat (might get a little warm, but thats fine) and it just kind of gets the digestion process kick started and makes you feel less full...i love eating *sigh*. Same concept as a walk after dinner, but here you only need 5 minutes (its actually 4 min) on a mat to wake up the muscles around the organs that need to be working for you.

I have the 1st of this series, and the 2nd is by far my favorite so far. Her voice is calmer and less shrill (automatically easier to stay tuned in:) ) and her movements are constant and intense.

Many of the exercises are the same as the 1st dvd (crunch focused), but there are some nice alterations as well that intensifies the quick routines.

I love variety, but some days you just want (or need) to get in and do the basic mindless, less complicated exercises that still give you great benefit.",1373760000,2,941,4.245810055865922
8133428,4,B000GNOGUG,i loved the first of this series of DVDs and although this one is also very good i still like the first one better,1368576000,,114,3.7916666666666665
8133429,5,B000GNOGUG,"In just minutes a day our family does both the beginning abs and the advanced abs before dinner.  Less than 10 minutes total and one very easy workout.  Only requires floor room for the abs workout.  Have yet to perform any other workouts that come with this video as the Abs section was the only purpose for purchase.  Whole family has this DVD, for around 10.00 it's totally worth the price!",1365984000,,393,4.492957746478873
8133430,5,B000GNOGUG,OH MAN! This DVD (well doing what the DVD instructor tells me to do) is REALLY shaping my abs.  Vol 1 and 2 are doing VERY WELL for me. I give it a whole 5 stars. I have yet to get 3 so I can't say anything about it.,1308528000,,216,3.4081632653061225
8133431,5,B000GNOGUG,"I really enjoyed the first Perfect Abs and the second one is also great.

Though it has some traditional abs that are similar to the first (but different workouts) it also adds alot more variation with pilates type movements to help get more parts in shape as you work on the abs also.

Nice combination.",1305072000,,304,4.509090909090909
8133432,5,B000GNOGUG,"A nice mix of pilatesesque ""core"" workouts, both mat and enhanced with weights, rings and a fitness ball, and some more standard ab routines of variations of crunches.
