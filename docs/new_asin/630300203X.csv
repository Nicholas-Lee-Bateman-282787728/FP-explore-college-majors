536592,4,630300203X,"The Good Son is a thriller about a boy with a sweet face who is the male equivalent of the Bad Seed. Henry (Macaulay Culkin, Home Alone)) appears loving and loyal to his parents, sister and friends, but he has a fondness for causing lethal fun, such as dropping a dummy from an overpass onto oncoming traffic, causing a multi-car collision. His cousin Mark (Elijah Wood, The Lord of the Rings trilogy) is staying with Henrys family while his father (David Morse) is away on business, and becomes an unwilling participant in Henrys sinister pranks.

The contrast between Henry and Culkins angelic kid from Home Alone is extreme. Henry goes about his day looking to harm, maim, and cause terrible damage. Mark is horrified about what he witnesses, but doesnt quite know how to handle it. The main character is Mark, not Henry, and Wood does an exceptional job conveying his confusion, terror, and frustration at seeing his cousin engage in deadly games. Mark turns to his aunt and uncle, but they don't believe his warnings, so it becomes Marks job to stop Henry, who has his own ideas.

A thriller in which a deviant child is the protagonist is novel enough to involve the viewer. As Henry escalates his fun, and hints at past, horrific events, it becomes clear that this child is pure evil with a facade that suggests a sweet kid. We see events unfold through Marks eyes, and wonder how one child can possibly stop another from his path of destructive, homicidal behavior.

Special bonus materials on the R-rated widescreen Blu-ray release include interviews with director Joseph Ruben, actors Wendy Crewson, Daniel Hugh Kelly, and David Morse, and cinematographer John Lindley. Also enclosed is the original theatrical trailer.",1501545600,,1728,4.910958904109589

536630,5,630300203X,"This film is very well made - riveting, believable and thought-provoking. That one young boy could be so inherently evil is hard to comprehend, but yet we know such people exist and that they commit heinous acts even as children. All the actors do a fine job in this film - Macauley Culkin and Elijah Wood are excellent and they play off of each other impressively well. The scenery is gorgeous and the Maine filming locations were recognizable. I loved the musical score by Elmer Bernstein (no relation to Leonard Bernstein). It was gorgeous and haunting at the same time and for those who love the film ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" recognizable and similarly entrancing. Elmer Bernstein was a prolific composer of movie scores. This film is well worth your time on so many levels.",1496016000,,777,4.762962962962963

536667,5,630300203X,They really don't make movies of this quality anymore. And I don't think that they could have chosen a better child actor at the time than Macaulay Culkin. The story really did a good job leading to the final scene. And the way it presented the kids playing reminded me of my own childhood when we played outside so it made it even creepier to watch the movie.,1491091200,,360,4.3088235294117645

I bought this, then hit play and Amazon says that I am missing or have disabled some widevine decryption module. In fact, I have it installed and enabled, so amazon has screwed up on their end. Also since I bought, not rented, this movie for too high a price for a digital only movie from as far back as 1993, I and others should have the ability to download and play from our own device and not need to stream it. That is what a purchase has always been and amazon should keep it going. The combination of too high a cost and problems streaming will have me looking for other options to get what I want whether legal copy or not.

His calm spirit led him to portray the ""good son"" in a most delightful way.  This movie should appear on television more often.

That being said though I do want to recommend the earlier film (1956!) The Bad Seed which I just saw and it was worlds better than The God Son.  The Bad Seed was incredibly mind blowing because it was the girl who played the evil child was incredible in her role and the whole cast was perfect.  The dialogue and the theme were more intricate and the entire experience was excellent..I would love to be able to see The Bad Seed again for the first time however that is pretty impossible.

537185,5,630300203X,"To me, nothing is scarier than an evil child. These kids are pure evil wrapped in the guise of innocence. They can usually get away with whatever they want and no one suspects their cute little angel of being a monster. Even if they are caught, what can anyone really do about it anyway? If that's not frighten enough, think about the fact that every serial killer on earth was at one time a child, and films like The Good Son represent a story that could be happening right now. The film begins when young Mark (Elijah Wood) losses his mother in a traffic accident. Mark's father is so distraught that he needs some time to himself and sends his son to live with his brother's family in the country. Both families think it will be good for Mark to be around someone his own age, his cousin Henry (Macaulay Culkin), but what they didn't know is that Henry is pure evil and has killed before. We see stories like this from time to time, but never one that is so realistic. When you think Killer Kids, movies like The Omen come to mind, but this is different as Henry isn't possessed, he's just a psychopath. This was Macaulay Culkin's first role after Home Alone and he is beyond terrific. At his age, Culkin is asked to play two roles, the innocent kid with the face of an angel and the demented psycho with the heart of the devil. How a pre-teen, who'd only been in two films prior, could accomplish such a feat, is nothing short of astounding. Elijah Wood is also great, showing that some people are just naturally talented. I've seen Wood in dozen's of things since The Good Son and his eyes still creep me out, it's almost like he can see right through you, and that might have made him a better choice to play Henry. While Wood might have had the look, you'd be hard pressed to find any kid who could do a better job than Culkin did here. The Good Son is mysterious, creepy, and a whole lot of fun to watch. It's among my favorite Horror films and really is one of the most underrated films of the nineties.",1412035200,,2012,4.325396825396825

That even when a mother dies, that another woman can fill in as a mother and give that child who lost their mother Light.

I personally do not believe that it's possible for a child with a good mother to be evil, as the bad child in this movie depicts, but it's a good movie regardless and well acted.

Despite its release in 93, the plot and setting are still believable. IMO its easy to see Woods textbook acting skills in another shy, sweet, fearful and quirky role, whereas Culkin delivers his lines like in his past roles yet is very believable as a smart but troubled kid.

The plot, setting, and drama was done right!  It has you wondering just what Henry is going to do next!  I also noticed that a more recent movie called ""Orphan""  is very similar to The good son.  Orphan was kind of like a (improved) remake. Has pretty much the same plot line and character elements.

537751,5,630300203X,"WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!

This intense & heart-warming suspense thriller stars Macaulay Culkin (""Uncle Buck,"" ""Home Alone,"" ""My Girl,"" ""Home Alone 2: Lost In New York"") and Elijah Wood (who would later star as Frodo in Peter Jackson's epic ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy) as two cousins, one of whom is reeling from the untimely death of his mother and the other who may or may not be what he seems. Both actors fit their roles perfectly. In several scenes, Macaulay reminded me of Hannibal Lecter in ""Silence Of The Lambs."" I felt that the evil child was a mini-Hannibal (minus the cannibalism, of course). I like one scene in particular: when Mark is moaning in his sleep and he thinks he sees his deceased mother, he follows her down the stairs and calls out to her, but it's his aunt Susan, he cries and she comforts him. That scene was beautifully shot and very tender (personally, I would have added a bit more to the scene). The sweetness is dispelled when the camera slowly pans up to reveal Henry watching this poignant moment from the banisters. Quinn Culkin (Macaulay's kid sister) was simply adorable as-you guessed it-Henry's kid sister. I have a few minor complaints: the movie ended too abruptly (it could have been 10-15 minutes longer, showing what happened on the cliff after the intense climax) and the evil child screamed as he fell (it seemed so out of character for him). Other than that, it's a very well done movie. Language and violence are very minimal for an R-rated movie (one F-word, two H-ll's and one God-d--n); it should have been rated PG-13.",1280534400,,1580,4.72463768115942

537864,5,630300203X,In this suspense thriller a 12-year-old boy goes to live with relatives after his mother's death and comes under the influence of his malevolent cousin. This movie is wierd and realistic. The way that Culkin's character acts is twisted but sometimes that is how twisted people get. This movie is very suspenseful. The plot was to die for and the acting was astonishing.,1262649600,,369,4.873015873015873
537865,5,630300203X,"After Macaulay Culkin became an overnight star in the ""Home Alone"" series his agents were anxious to cast him in roles that were very different from his comedic performances. In ""The Good Son"" Culkin portrays a character that is many watts away from ""Home Alone"". In this film his character is obviously disturbed and his evil side emerges when his family takes in his cousin (played by Elijah Wood) after the death of the cousin's mother. When the Culkin character realizes his own mother is starting to bond with his cousin, he takes drastic measures to halt the relationship. Superb performances, creepy camera work, and an intense well-written script makes ""The Good Son"" a must-see film. The movie is great to watch on a winter afternoon as the film , I believe, was shot mostly in the northeast in the dead of winter near the Atlantic ocean. Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't come with any extras, but the film contains both the full and widescreen formats for your enjoyment. Although nearly all the critics panned the film, ""The Good Son"" has so far grossed over $60 million worldwide.",1260921600,2,1090,4.834224598930481
537866,4,630300203X,"This is truly and underrated and unappreciated movie. It's not perfect, and the short runtime cuts out some important plot points that still could have been expanded upon, however the pitfalls of this movie are fixed by Wood and Culkin.

537867,5,630300203X,"I absolutley loved this movie, it is one of the best horror/thrillers I have seen for a long time. Macaulay Culkin is great as the cute-but-evil Henry as is Elijah Wood as Mark, the protagonist. I thought they both did a great job as portraying beleivable charactors (especially considering that they were six years too young to legally watch their own movie).

The plot of the movie is very consistant and goes not slow down or drag in places and some of the scenes are very suspenceful, particularly the scene where Henry is pointing a nail-gun toward a cat and we don't know if he is going to kill it.

I was very surprised that this movie was rated 18 as there is no sex or violence at all and only one swear (the F word) so I would say this movie is probably ok for children over the age of 12 or so to watch.

Shortly after Mark's (Elijah Wood) mother dies, his father takes him to live in New England with his Aunt and Uncle and 12 year old cousin, Henry (Macaulay Culkin). At first Mark seems to be having a good time until he begins to see the real Henry when a slip leaves him dangling over the side of a treehouse (which is about 100 feet high) and Hery asks him ""If I let go, do you think you could fly?"". Then, Henry throws a dummy onto a busy highway causing a ten-car pileup and Mark realises that Henry is much more dangerous than he thought...

A great horror/thriller movie that I would highly recomend.",1237507200,3,1421,4.271375464684015
537868,5,630300203X,"Henry (Macaulay Culkin) is a typical young boy. He spends his care-free hours playing, building crossbows to kill neighborhood pets, and causing major freeway accidents. He enjoys watching the results of his play. His mum and dad have been down in the dumps ever since Henry's little brother had his fatal ""accident"" in the tub. Unlike Henry, the folks just let it keep bothering them for some reason. Now, there's cousin Mark (Elijah Wood from The Ice Storm, Lord Of The Rings, and Sin City) to worry about. He's staying for a couple of weeks while his dad (David Morse from The Green Mile and Disturbia) is in Japan. At first, Henry thought that Mark might be fun, but he's a drag. He doesn't seem to enjoy Henry's games at all. Not even the chain-reaction car wreck game on the interstate! What a bore! If only Mark could get over his mother's recent demise. What is it with people and their ""feelings"" anyway? Henry just wants to have fun, and if Mark wants to be a big baby and a tattle-tale, then he just might have to have an ""accident"" of his own. What a shame. Oh well. THE GOOD SON is a terrific thriller from director Joseph Ruben (The Stepfather). Culkin and Wood are utterly believable in their roles. Culkin's portrayal of a budding serial killer is so good it's frightening! Why did this kid disappear?? Wood is great too as the boy who knows what's going on, but can't get anyone to believe him.

537871,3,630300203X,"It is ironic that the film that could have elevated the extremely popular, Macaulay Culkin from clich to substantive actor instead served to showcase his flaws as an actor.  In the ""Home Alone"" movies Culkin was a pretty face that Chris Columbus molded into an engaging child hero in his sadistic series of movies.  Never had two lackluster villains been so violently abused.  For Culkin that was as good as it was going to get.

In ""The Good Son,"" Culkin lacks the backbone to bring the evil Henry to life.  Henry is every bit as evil as the monster in ""The Bad Seed,"" but his portrayal lacks the conviction that is necessary to bring off a psychopath.  Conversely, Elijah Wood, who turns out to be the good son, brings a considerable verisimilitude to his role and in so doing further highlights the need for a stronger antagonist.

Perhaps the explanation for Culkin's poor performance was that he burned out at a tender age, or that he was reared in a dysfunctional family.  I remember him most as the smart allecky five year old in ""Uncle Buck."" Here he peppers his hapless uncle (John Candy) with a string of questions that only a child can carry off.  Elijah Wood went on to become a fine actor who is perhaps best known for his role in ""The Lord of the Rings.""  Macaulay was to fall further in the coming years, and this is disappointing for those who saw such early promise.

Culkin is anything but likable in this thriller, Wood always gives a good peformance. The two stars have great chemistry and many people see this film as a guilty pleasure, I guess you can say that so with that in mind give this sleeper film a try, enjoy!",1215475200,,376,4.385714285714286
537873,5,630300203X,"""The Good Son"" is more of an answer than a question, I think. Because it tells the viewer that sometimes things aren't always what they appear to be. When I first saw this movie, some 15 years ago when it was first out, I had a hard time believing the plot; especially the ending. How can parents be so blind? Could this really happen? The film is rather thought-provoking in that regard.

Here's the characters of this movie (listed in order of importance:)
Henry Evans (Macaulay Culkin)
Mark Evans (Elijah Wood)
Susan Evans (Wendy Crewson)
Connie Evans (Quinn Culkin)
Wallace Evans (Daniel Hugh Kelly)
Jack Evans (David Morse)
Dr. Alice Davenport (Jacqueline Brookes)

I also enjoyed the movie because it showcased Macaulay Culkin in a new and exciting role. Before this, we all knew him as cute Kevin McCallister in the Christmas-classic, Home Alone. Maybe, one of the reasons why this movie is somewhat controversial is because a lot of people can't get passed that.

Once Mark goes to stay with Uncle Wallace and Aunt Susan Henry really starts to unravel. He plans that horrible accident (over the freeway,) he kills the dog and he makes cryptic threats to Mark. And, that was something else that made me think. Why was he all-of-a-sudden starting to unravel? In hindsight, the answer is two-fold. Henry was always a kook. But his parents were too oblivious to that detail. And, things only began to get worse when Mark came around because Henry was acting up out of jealousy.

Macaulay Culkin plays a severely disturbed child with such finesse and talent. Because Henry wasn't just a spoiled brat that always wanted to get his way and always wanted attention. He was a calculating misery-machine who didn't let anything stand in his way when he wanted something. And he was vastly intelligent.

My favorite part is when Mark confronts Henry in the tree house. This is probably the first (and only) time in Henry's life where he was called to explain his evil actions. And, I loved what Henry said to him, ""don't f-u-c-k with me."" Who would of thought that Macaulay Culkin had it in him!

The ending of the movie was incredibly outrageous and over-the-top. But it was pure drama and interesting up and until the last second!

The supporting cast was extraordinary. I really enjoyed the performance by soap opera veteran, Jacqueline Brookes as Dr. Alice Davenport. Dr. Davenport added a touch of realism and continuity to the film because she was always around to help the ""troubled"" Mark. I loved it when she said to Mark (in the park, after he missed his appointment with her,) ""I don't believe in evil,"" and the very talented Elijah Wood (as Mark) said to her, ""you should.""

I did find one scene towards the end to be rather odd. Remember when Uncle Wallace locked Mark in his office and Mark started banging on the windows to warn Aunt Susan about Henry? Why did he call her ""Susan?"" He never once referred to her as ""Aunt Susan"" as one would expect him to.

There isn't a bona fide ""special edition"" DVD. However the DVD does include some special features, such as: a full screen version of the film, a wide screen version of the film, close-captioning, language selection, the original movie trailer and a brief featurette on the making of the film. The movie is a total of 86 minutes long, which goes by very quick.

Doesn't it seem like the early to mid-90's were the Golden Age of Suspense/Mystery Thrillers? There were so many great movies in this genre, during this time. Besides ""The Good Son,"" I highly recommend these pictures:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Single-White-Female/dp/0767802616/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Single White Female</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hand-That-Rocks-the-Cradle/dp/6305213305/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unlawful-Entry/dp/B00005A3KV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unlawful Entry</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crush/dp/B00004RF85/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crush</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passenger-57/dp/6304936311/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passenger 57</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Client/dp/6304712952/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Client</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Siege/dp/0790732238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Siege</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poison-Ivy/dp/0780627776/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poison Ivy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fugitive/dp/B00005ATZT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fugitive</a>.

I really love ""The Good Son."" It has everything you would expect in an over-the-top film. Excitement, suspense, drama and maybe even a bit of comedy and camp thrown in for good measure. But this is not a children's movie. Just because the 2 main stars are children does not mean kids should be watching it. It's Rated-R for a very good reason.",1201564800,3,5218,6.223300970873787
537981,5,630300203X,"After Home Alone, Macaulay Culkin - apparently tired of slapping himself in front of the mirror over forgetful parents, bumbling bandits and PG ratings - gave his fans the R-rated psycho kid from hell thriller The Good Son, and in the process took an axe to his image and his career. Here Mac pushes little girls onto thin ice, drops life-sized dummies onto busy highways and barks back at ferocious dogs. And you sit there laughing at Culkin's best comedy ever. If only this movie wasn't supposed to be a horror picture.

It all starts when Culkin's good cousin Mark, (the far more talented child actor Elijah Wood ) promises his cancer-stricken mother he'll save her. She doesn't make it. Wood blames himself. An opportunity for rustic therapy presents itself when Wood's father (David Morse), who has to make a business trip to Japan, dispatches his son to Culkin's New England home for two weeks. Maybe atop a craggy coastline, Wood can break through the grief and make friends with sweet-faced Culkin. As the boys scramble off to Culkin's treehouse, Culkin's mother (Wendy Crewson) smiles warmly. ""I think he's going to be fine,"" she tells Wood's father. (Insert ""Jaws"" music here. )

Near the top of the lofty treehouse, Wood nearly tumbles to his death. Culkin saves him but keeps Wood dangling. ""If I let you go,"" says MacPsycho, ""do you think you could fly?""

There are more ominous signs of things to come than there are billboards on Route 1. ""I took a real good look when my brother Richard drowned in the bathtub,"" says Culkin, when the subject of death comes up. And there's a photograph of Little Richard clutching a rubber duck. Remember that duck, it's part of a canard-motif.

The forebodings pile up: Culkin shows Wood his homemade crossbow, which fires lethal metal-bolt projectiles. Down goes the local nasty dog. Culkin introduces Wood to his favorite ""fun"" game, in which he takes a dummy, called ""Mr. Highway,"" to a bridge and drops it into dense traffic.  Look! A ten car pile-up! How Culkin smiles.

For the plot to survive, characters must lower their intelligence considerably. Culkin's parents remain as oblivious to their son's psychotic tendencies as they are heedless of Wood's perpetual warnings. Like most Hollywood villains, Culkin has a talent for turning the tables on accuser Wood and making him look like the Bad Seed. Everyone suffers from stupidity, from child psychologist Jacqueline Brookes, who believes Culkin's lies, to the ice-skating crowd that watches from a distance as Culkin attempts to drown his sister (Quinn Culkin) under the ice. (What joy!) The ending, featuring more bodies dangling from great heights, is too laughable to outline. Culkin's murderous ways, it turns out, go back to that quacker in the photo. (Don't ask.)

Culkin's father Kit apparently held Fox to ransom to extend his son's range with this role (no Good Son, no Home Alone 2.) In any event, young Mac is decisively upstaged by Wood at almost every turn. One can only imagine what the film could have been had the boy's roles been reversed. But it really doesn't matter.

Although, you don't really get the feel of suspense because of the peaceful and flowing music, the message behind the plot would really give you the chills.

Elijah Wood acted out every expression he had to act out fully with his face. You could really see the fear in his eyes when he realizes Henry(Macaulay Culkin) is planning to hurt someone.

The story begins with a vast highland then starts off with Mark (Elijah) playing soccer with his friends. Then, out of the blue, his dad appears and we are brought to a hospital scene where Mark sits beside his mother's deathbed. He promises her that she won't die.

Unfortunately, she does and Mark is full of sadness at her funeral. His dad has to go to a business trip to Japan for 2 weeks leaving him behind with Henry's family. At first, he gets along well with Henry but soon finds out his evil schemes. Henry always gets away with all his schemes with his angelic smile.

I thought Elijah was great, as he always is in all his movies. Though he was only a kid back then, he acted from his heart. As for Macaulay, I thought he really showed a sense of madness and jealousy but lost expression at times. He was great at expressing silent anger and suspense. He showed that he was fully in the dark side. Although he had little changes in facial expressions and reactions from that of 'Home Alone', I still have to give him credit for acting such a difficult role. If you've never been on stage or films before, you'd never know how hard it is to act as a villain than a hero.

Some scenes really impressed me especially the cliff scene. It's amazing how the production managed to shoot that part without any visual effects especially with two young lads.

All in all, I thought the movie was entertaining. I was impressed at how 12-year-olds could do really well at their age. I'm already 15 and have experienced acting on stage and you all must know. It's not easy. Before critizing their acting, you have to think that they're only kids and I have to say, they were very professional.

""If I let you go...do you think you could fly?""

This is what I think is a special quote when I watched the theatrical trailer on my DVD of ""The Good Son"" and it is a very interesting opposite turn in Macaulay Culkin's career from the ""Home Alone"" movies to this where he plays a murderer named Henry. This is really worth watching if you've never seen it and if you like thrillers.

Mark Evans {Elijah Wood} goes to live with his aunt and uncle and his cousin Henry after his mother dies and his father goes away on a business trip. When Mark first meets Henry, they are great friends. Their friendship goes too far when Henry soon becomes evil and Mark is the only one who sees the truth about his cousin after he kills a dog with a crossbow and Henry wants Mark to have fun in his own way when Henry throws his dummy Mr. Highway onto a crowded highway and causes a pileup, and while Henry tries to kill his sister several times. Later on, Mark keeps trying to convince Henry's mother Susan {Wendy Crewson} that Henry is murderous and she doesn't believe him, so Mark is left to confront Henry before anything worse can happen.

I usually don't watch thrillers, but this is cool. I thought it was worth seeing to see Macaulay Culkin's psychotic acting and it is worth about 4 and a half stars because it starts out a little slow, but when Henry's friendly behavior changes, it's worth all the rest that it's worth.",1135468800,,1429,4.401515151515151

538115,4,630300203X,"It's child-star vs. child star in ""The Good Son,"" a disturbing suspense movie about the brutality that even children can commit. Somehow it's not surprising that Ian McEwan wrote the screenplay -- it's no cheery, cutesy story, but a horror movie in every sense of the word.

As the movie opens, Mark (Elijah Wood) is brought to his mother's bedside as she dies. At the funeral, his father learns that he will have to go on a business trip, which will ""set you and Mark up for life."" So he drops off Mark at his uncle and aunt's in New England, hoping that the boy will buck up emotionally when he's around other kids. At first, all is well -- Mark immediately becomes pals with his cousin Henry (Macaulay Culkin), and the boys are soon inseparable.

But then Henry enlists Mark in a crazy prank: throwing a dummy onto a crowded highway, causing a massive accident. Mark realizes that his cousin cares nothing about the lives of others -- and discovers that he may have caused his baby's brother's mysterious death. But no one believes Mark -- and now Henry is planning to kill others in his family...

It's a sad fact that children can be as evil as adults, but the myth of childish purity sticks to us. That's why ""Good Son"" is so disturbing. Rather than treating the two kids as cardboard cutouts, they are as complex as adults -- capable of good or evil, and of terrible thoughts and actions. And, as we see in Mark, they can be heroes as well.

The storyline has a few too many cliches -- for example, the parents are utterly in the dark about Henry's true nature, although the mom does get a clue late in the movie. Ian McEwan did an excellent job with the scripting, however, slowly building up the suspense through little things like Henry pondering, ""If I let you fall... do you think you could fly?"" as Mark was dangling off a tree's branch. He also gives a sense of despration, as Mark tries to rescue Henry's little sister from an ""accident,"" or destroys all the food when he thinks Henry has poisoned it all.

Wood gave a stellar performance as Mark, though he was the lesser child star at the time. He uses his expressive face and eyes to full advantage, showing all of Mark's horror, indecision, fear and sorrow without a word. Too bad Culkin wasn't nearly as good -- his portrayal of Henry is completely flat. The most emotion he ever shows is a shrug; I almost expected him to yawn.

It's just wrong to do when children are at that young an age. Is it any wonder that Macaulay Culkin has turned out the way he did, whether you believe the press or not, or a certain MJ is involved. This movie gave me the creeps, I dread to think how it messed up his poor little head. To say his character is a homicidal kid with serious problems is an understatement. First of all, he kills a dog with a nail-gun he created. And then he tries to kill his sister (numerous times). And then we find out that years ago, his little brother drowned in the bathtub while he was looking over him (we find out later he killed the boy because his brother got one of his toys, a rubber duck, and he wanted it back). It was cool to see Macaulay in a slightly different role to that of the rich or bratty little kid he's played so often. If you want to see a role where he's really different, Saved comes highly recommended, plus, he looks really cute towards the end! There's no doubt that by the time this film came out and his shocked picture was everywhere on the Home Alone posters, that he was fed up of being typecast.

The ending is very creepy, and a bit of a wrong choice to be given to the mother. Frankly, I didn't understand it, and had to ask why, why, why?

To say this film is a bit messed up in portraying the oldest child, who was probably jealous of his younger siblings, as a killer, is quite creepy, and very disturbing. The ending will spook you, as will Elijah Wood's performance (the bug eyed look gets you every time), and will leave you with shivers up your spine.

538226,2,630300203X,"The deal was Macaulay Culkin would return for another ""Home Alone"" if he was allowed to be in a movie that would be very un-Kevin (the name of his character from the John Hughes film).  That's how ""The Good Son"", the remake of a much better film, ""The Bad Seed"" was born.
The premise of the story is that Culkin is a menace (more in the sense of Anakin Skywalker, not Dennis) and terrorizes Mark (the Elijah Wood character) who comes to stay with Macaulay's family after his mother dies.  Rather than give us settle clues and build suspense, the film simply shows us one terrible act committed by Culkin's character after the other.  Elijah Wood--who is a fine actor, even as a child--is reduced to a cartoonish situation of witnessing these crimes but not being in a position to stop him (after all, Culkin's character threatens, he's the one that's ""messed up"" since his mother died).
This motion picture may be thrilling to good, well-behaved 12-year-old boys who want to get a taste of the wild side (of course, they're too young to see it), but for everyone else it is either going to be a grim reminder of the evening news, or a boring motion picture that fails to live up to the talents of those acting in it.
To really see these stars shine as child actors I recommend ""My Girl"" for McCulkin fans (which is by far his best picture) and ""Radio Flyer"" for Elijah Wood fanatics.",1070841600,8,1383,4.50199203187251
538227,3,630300203X,"For those who don't know what I mean by my title, let me do a quick history. Christopher ""Kit"" Culkin is Macaulay Culkin's father, and he pushed for Mac to play Henry, a child that looked fine on the outside but to call him disturbed and violent would be an understatement. By the way, when I said he pushed for the role, I meant that Kit is one of those people who gets what he wants by any means necessary. He also pushed for Mac to get top billing, and looking back, I think that was pretty obvious because a lot of people (myself included) think Elijah Wood should have gotten top billing because he had far more lines.
Now on to the movie. I think this movie was a little disturbing, but maybe it was because people were used to Macaulay playing a spunky, comedic kid in family films. But then again, maybe the movie would have been disturbing no matter WHO the lead was. Reason being, it was also weird how violent Henry was, and it was apparently for no reason. Also, I think the only reason this movie was rated R was to keep a lot of kids from seeing Mac in such a different role (especially when he utters the ""F"" word). This movie really should have been rated PG-13.
All in all, this movie is kind of hard to describe in a few words. I personally think you can do without it, but if I made you curious, go right ahead and watch.

538228,5,630300203X,"Being an actor requires that you be the possessor of a whole list of extraordinary traits such as being at least fairly talented, having an appealing personality, being just original enough to be interesting and looking halfway decent in stylish clothes, among others. Being a child actor is wholly different, mostly because the large majority of child actors defy the number one rule in that they are sadly lacking in any form of true talent.
 For example, you have Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who were (and still are) unbearable to watch on screen. There is also every child who ever set foot on the set a Disney channel show and most of the children with small roles on adult sitcoms. These kids are cute but they just can't act.
 So when an agent comes across a really good child actor, its no surprise that suddenly that poor kid is slapped with a starring role in every movie made while they're still young enough to look normal in overalls, hence, the story of McCauley Culkin and Elijah Wood's lives.
 One of the most interesting things about Joseph Ruben's 1993 film `The Good Son', is that its about criminal insanity and is rated `R' yet the two main characters are barely ten years old. To Ruben the concept must have stood out as wonderfully original, but making the movie was a risky decision because finding two kids talented enough to play the apparently ""evil"", Henry and his earnest cousin, Mark could not have been easy.
But, miraculously, the casting agents did it and well-known child actors Culkin and Wood were respectively cast.
 When Mark's mother dies a premature death, he is sent to live with his aunt, uncle and cousins for two weeks while his father closes a business deal in Tokyo. Mark and his cousin Henry are around the same age and immediately get along after being reintroduced. However, things are not as peaceful as they seem in Henry's house. Less than a year ago, the family's youngest child, Richard, drowned in the bathtub and Mark's aunt Susan is still deeply distraught over the ""accident"", which she considers her fault. At first Mark considers this story sad but unpreventable; however, as he gets to know his cousin better, his true personality puts the account in a whole new light.
 This movie is truly child acting at its best. Culkin's performance suggests that he understands his malicious but brilliant character better than most adult actors understand far simpler roles. Wood, who has always had the ability to completely become any character he plays, is equally stunning, playing a desperate, victimized little boy with outstanding capability. It's hard to judge which young man is the better actor, or even which part was harder to play, their raw talent should make any actor go green with envy. They also have exceptional screen chemistry, which makes not only their characters, but also their characters' relationship intensely believable, the scenes that they are in together are by far the best.
 David Morse, Wendy Crewson and Quinn Culkin (MaCauley's sister) are also members of the cast, which is particularly small. However, their performances look amateur next to (the older) Culkin and Wood, and in comparison to her brother's Quinn's performance outlines the difference between a good child actor and a bad one.",1059091200,31,3281,4.902702702702703

538320,2,630300203X,"I was wandering through my local video store the other day when I came across this movie. I had never really heard of it before since I was too young to see it when it came out. It caught my eye mainly for one reason, well two really ""Culkin and Wood."" How is it that a director managed to get the best two child actors of the 1990s together in a movie and is it really any good?
It depends. The movie is admitedly sick. The whole idea of a psychopathic serial killer 12 year old is just a little too bizarre for me. However, the story is entertaining and suspenseful, yet horribly predictable. If you have a slighty twisted mind you will probably like this movie, if you are extremely conservative, stay away.
Now for the acting. I thought the Wendy Crewson was excellent as Susan and I thought the little Culkin did a fair job as the little sister. However, McCaughly Culkin was not believeable. Perhaps I just don't like his style but I did not like his performance. Wood however, was a gem. Not that he doesn't usually pull off fine performances, but this one was great. It angers me that Culkin got top billing for this movie, one considering that Wood had a lot more screen time and two because the whole movie was based on Wood's character.
So overall, a decent movie, not the best, but worth seing if you havn't already, are a fan of Wendy Crewson or Elijah Wood and want to watch fine acting at its best, or you just have a taste for somewhat sick and twisted plots.",1041465600,9,1475,4.328519855595668
538321,5,630300203X,"There are times in life when we are forced to come to grips with the inherent evil of humanity.  In The Good Son (directed by Joseph Ruben), evil surfaces in Henry (Macaulay Culkin), a 13-year-old boy whose innocent appearance fools his family.
Henry does not hide his actions from his cousin Mark (Elijah Wood), who is staying with Henry's family following the death of his mother.  As Mark realizes the terrible truth behind Henry's personality, he must convince Henry's parents of the evil that has caused so much harm.
Macaulay Culkin's role in The Good Son is a departure from his usual role as a good-natured child prankster, notably in Home Alone and Home Alone 2.  Rather than being the avenue for harmless slapstick comedy and traditional feel-good values, Culkin's character is involved in dangerous and disturbing schemes intended at taking out his family.
When Mark first arrives at Henry's house, the two spend their days doing typical boy activities, such as climbing into tree houses, playing football, and exploring hideouts.  Then, while playing with a homemade crossbow, Henry shoots a dog.  Mark is horrified by the canine slaughter, and begins to realize that something is drastically wrong.
As the movie progresses, it is clear Henry is motivated by jealousy.  Henry's mother, who devotes much of her attention to Mark, is unaware of her son's disturbing actions or his intense jealousy and hatred of those jockeying for her affection.
Now set on destroying Mark and his family, Henry uses his leverage as the supposed `good son' to his advantage.  In front of his parents, Henry expresses his concern for Mark, who he says is reeling from his mother's death, but in private, he makes his evil intentions fully known and threatens Mark.
Soon after, Henry takes his younger sister Connie (played by Culkin's real-life younger sister Quinn Culkin) ice-skating on a pond, and flings her onto thin ice.  After she falls through, Henry watches her begin to down, refusing to extend his hand and pull her up.  Connie is rescued, and when Mark tells Henry's parents what really happened, they are appalled.  Refusing to believe the truth, they feel Mark is suffering repercussions of his mother's death, and send him to a psychologist.
Eventually, Henry's mother begins to piece together the evidence. Torn between her knowledge of the horrific truth and love for her flesh and blood, she must decide between what she knows is reality and what she wants to believe.
While many psychological dramas play on the thoughts and emotions of viewers through blood, gore, and big-time special effects, The Good Son is small-scale, and uses a relatively simple, developing plot that produces a thought-provoking film.  The effect of The Good Son is only strengthened by the fact its resolution is skillfully masked and comes as a shock.
Another strength of The Good Son, and perhaps the reason for its ""R"" rating, is its realism.  The events and characters are not improbable.  They are horrifying, but completely believable.  The potency of The Good Son comes from the fact that its content is troubling, yet real, so the audience must deal with the film's theme, the nature of humanity.
Watching The Good Son may leave the viewer troubled, but nonetheless fulfilled.  Rather than being exploited, one is faced with a series of dark secrets and left in some sort of philosophical bind that must be resolved.  The Good Son is a productive watch, and a captivating glimpse into humanity.",1040256000,14,3491,4.993103448275862

7834889,5,630300203X,"As a kid growing up in the 90's, (would've been 3 when this movie came out) I remember many days where my mom had this movie playing on VHS in the living room. It's always stuck with me as a very good movie from childhood, to teens, and into young adulthood, still watching it on VHS the whole time. After my VHS player finally died about 6 years ago, I hadn't even thought of this movie. Then very randomly, it just popped into my head a few days ago so I bought it immediately afterwards. Very, very happy to own it again on DVD this time. It's still as good as I remember it being.",1523491200,,584,4.086956521739131

7834894,5,630300203X,"that was probably the most F**** up ending i have ever seen but I loved it all the more, I am blown away by the concept and the fact that this is an actual movie shown to people. It really puts a spin on ""A mothers love is never ending"". If I was the mom in that situation I might have done the same thing. I mean come on (SPOILER) her son did try to kill her 5 seconds before his own demise. BUT STILL, the conflict i'm feeling. What a statement this movie has made!",1512950400,2,467,3.875
