8028340,2,B0002KPIA0,"Wong(Koo) is a banker with the romantic sensibility of a stone. For Valentine's day he takes his date to a cheap restaurant and invites an obnoxious friend.  Disgusted, Anne decides to break up with Wong, but Wong's uncle intervenes persuading Anne to delay her decision until Easter. Desperate, Wong consults a teenage romance 'doctor'to help him get his lovelife back on track.

Seriously, this was simply a bad film. Koo played an unlikable loser and Anne and he had no chemistry.  Koo! Please no more glasses! *Whew* just had to get that off my chest. Seriously, this was a very poor HK romantic comedy. Wong and Anne were boring and unromantic and the plot unbelievable. 2 stars... NEXT-!",1120003200,,693,4.8559322033898304
