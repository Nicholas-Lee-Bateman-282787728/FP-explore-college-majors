In my opinion there is no video concert that can match besides the Purple Rain Live concert video that for whatever reason had not been available on DVD. That said, my rating is for the quality of the Bluray. The colors are over saturated and there is a lot of pixelation. The DVD version looks much better on screen.",1478476800,,381,4.305555555555555
8642470,5,B00IJ57IGC,"I'm in the states, so glad I bought this, and I hope the same set gets sold in here soon but who knows. The DVD case is mostly in Japanese but you can play it on a Ps4 with no drama. Super easy to turn off the Japanese captions and navigate the BLU RAY menu. Yeah- SOTT in BluRay is even better than you remember it. Prince live is something you can't miss and we are lucky to have this in near perfect, quality. I hope everything else recorded by his Purple Majesty becomes available and with this much clarity. If it gets released in the states I'll buy it for sure just to know what this book says. Anyone speak Japanese? Excellent transaction with the seller as well. It arrived sooner than expected. Very cool.",1466553600,2,715,4.264705882352941
8642471,5,B00IJ57IGC,I'm wondering why this says blu ray but all of the comments are about the cd. Is this the concert movie or just the live cd?,1464652800,2,124,3.8076923076923075

8642474,5,B00IJ57IGC,Well worth the price to have this amazing concert film in brilliant blu ray quality.,1457395200,2,84,4.666666666666667
8642475,4,B00IJ57IGC,"This refers to the 2014 Japanese Blu-Ray Box Set.

So nice to see this with upgraded video.  Picture is not ""stunning"" but much better than the DVD release.

Bummed that there are no real extras on the disc and sad that the handful of ""extra"" musical scenes filmed for the movie have never been added in.  Such a short movie (1h25m) based on what is an excellent double album.

Crazy expensive box set and the box set booklet and cards inside aren't all that interesting.

This is such a great concert movie though - I don't regret my purchase!",1436572800,7,544,4.444444444444445
