3441673,1,B0019MG2XW,"Back from the dead, the FFR sleaze film review, to comment on the state of the art, I guess.  Because sleaze flicks, and I'm talking sexploitation  like nuns, prison women, serial killers, etc., are not only definitely non PC these days, they're also pretty much a lost art due to the lack of distribution.  No drive ins left, all sit-down theaters run by global corporations, and any notion of a nudie cutie version of these things (ala Troma) made a joke by the overwhelming wash of internet porn.

Which apparently leaves one outlet left, direct to DVD releases like this, where the director is the guy running the ""film company"", taping an ultra-cheap vid with student actors, hoping for a few Azon sales based on including buzz words like ""tortured in his basement"" (and a five-star review by a friend or cast member).  The result is usually not just disappointing, but a total joke.

Like this ultimate turkey, which looks exactly like some dude filmed some buds and one of their girlfriends they coaxed into getting her clothes off, which doesn't start until 38 minutes into this waste of plastic.  Nothing actually happens, just some mild bondage, and the whole thing is suffused in a nonsensical soundtrack including voice overs and constant pounding sludge rock.  I'm not even sure there was any actual dialogue, it was difficult to tell with my finger mostly leaning on the fast forward button.

The lesson is obvious.  No, you will not discover some juicy sleaze bits in a film that cost little more than the cassettes used up taping it.  Sleaze, aside from actual big-budget things like ""Hostel"", is pretty much dead.  Rest in pieces.",1218499200,28,1647,4.822064056939502
3441674,4,B0019MG2XW,"I should warn you that this is NOT a good movie! It is anything but a good movie. This is one of those movies that is so terribly bad that you get kicks from making fun of it. With horrid acting, dreadful writing, dreadful directing, and the cinematography that would come from an amateur on YouTube, ""Black Ribbon"" is a gas to watch. So if you like movies like ""The Room"" and ""Troll 2,"" you'll love this one!",1400371200,4,409,4.256410256410256

3441676,1,B0019MG2XW,the man had his tongue out the whole time! even those with mental handicaps know how hard that is to do all day yet this producer thinks it's appropriate? the only reason I give it a 1 star rating is for the 80's style nudity!,1392076800,,226,4.044444444444444
3441677,1,B0019MG2XW,"The official Amazon plot summary: ""John Orrichio Films presents a new feature entitled Black Ribbon, which is written and directed by John Orrichio. It is an intriguing, and suspenseful tale of horror with its taunting, and captivating pace which unfolds into sheer terror.""  Doubtless written by John Orrichio.  Did John Orrichio also star in this movie?

I'm sorry (no I'm not, actually) but if you want to draw me in to watch this film, Mr. Orrichio, you need to consult a publicist.  An actual practicing-and-knows-what-they're-doing publicist, not John Orrichio the megalomaniac publicist.  There's nothing about this description that makes me want to risk a moment watching this movie.  The exuberantly negative reviews don't help.

I don't get it; why would you want to put something this bad out there with your name all over it... unless John Orrichio is someone you want to embarrass horribly.  This might actually do it.

I've never reviewed something without partaking of it before, but the official plot summary was so lackluster I had to speak up... maybe someone can get it updated with a better one.",1388534400,,1115,5.082417582417582
3441678,1,B0019MG2XW,"Every part of this movie (and I use the word ""movie"" with much hesitation and for lack of another more appropriate label) is incredibly, amazingly, mind-bogglingly bad.
It could and should be used as an affective means of torture.
Anyone know how to get in touch with the boys at Guantanamo Bay?

3441680,1,B0019MG2XW,"How do movies that this get made? Well, it's obvious that it was low budget, because no one would back it. Don't waste your time hoping that it's a ""so bad it's good"" production; it's not. If you want to be entertained then use the video mode on your digital camera and make your own movie; it couldn't be an worse than this.",1345680000,7,325,4.174603174603175
3441681,3,B0019MG2XW,"First of all this is a low budget movie with low know and somewhat inexperienced actors. Inside this limitations the film works rather well.
The simple plot is correctly exposed, the actors are no demanded above their skills and perform well, the victim, althoug not as cute as my internal sadist may desire, is satisfactorily naked, tortured and frightened all the time, the twist is very well presented and when it happens completely logical, the police officers than suspect but do not know act in a rational manner, the technical aspects all, not extraordinalily but well resolved in an  There is of course the caracter of the anoying (to the writer) housemaid, than other of be anoying, I do not know what porpouse may have, and the gothic botanist caracterization is even more cartonish than the others, but as a whole the movie works, as I have already say, rather well.
Spoiler.
That is until the ""all have been a dream"" innecesary end.
End of the spoiler.
