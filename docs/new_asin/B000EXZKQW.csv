2546159,2,B000EXZKQW,"Saw this movie in the theater.

It's the kind of awkward, stupid but funny, humor that you need to be around with a bunch of friends to laugh at. But unfortunatley for the most part the humor quickly becomes very crude, which in 99% of the cases doesn't even add any humor to the movie.

Some funny scenes here and there that are good to quote with your buddies, but overall it's a missed opportunity because you feel like this movie could have been a cult classic.

I would not reccommend this movie to anyone, except perhaps to a group of paintball players on a road trip or a bachelor party. It's worthless otherwise.",1146182400,,620,4.421052631578948
2546160,4,B000EXZKQW,"Really I'd give it 3 and a half.  It had some decently funny moments.  A few of the jokes only ballers would truly get, but enjoyable overall.",1431648000,,142,4.222222222222222
2546161,1,B000EXZKQW,Boooooooorrrrriiinnnngggg,1430697600,,25,25.0
2546162,5,B000EXZKQW,"This movie is hilarious. I love the dry humor and every time I watch it, I hear a new joke or one-liner that I hadn't heard beforehand.",1426809600,,135,4.037037037037037
2546163,4,B000EXZKQW,Rough around the edges but profoundly funny & quotable.  Requires a tolerance for shaky camera work & improvisational comedy.,1426032000,,125,5.578947368421052
2546164,5,B000EXZKQW,Such a a good movie lots of action,1420588800,,34,3.375
2546165,5,B000EXZKQW,Crazy and fascinating. Enjoyed watching.,1407974400,,40,7.2
2546166,4,B000EXZKQW,Grandson wanted this. He paint balls. He liked it. Fast service. Would recommend this sight to anyone interested in what he sells.,1381708800,,130,4.954545454545454
2546167,4,B000EXZKQW,Great and underrated cast. Improv movie at its finest. Heard Rob Corddry on a radio interview and ran out to get this. Worth it.,1372118400,,128,4.375
2546168,5,B000EXZKQW,Gotta give it 5 stars because it was filmed at my home field! That and I was in it for about 1/10 of a second!! Bunch of cool guys that worked on it too.,1371340800,,153,3.5294117647058822
2546169,1,B000EXZKQW,"Cheesy satire, not a documentary as I had expected. The acting was horrible, and the set ps were a little over the top.",1365465600,,119,4.217391304347826
2546170,2,B000EXZKQW,"Where as Talladega Night's was hard to watch because it was just so... awkward, this was hard to watch because it was really slow. Seemed like they were trying to make a Talledega Night's for other 'sports', but didn't really have jokes worked out before hand. I like paintball a lot, and liked the actors in this movie a lot, I just didn't like the movie, finishing it was a chore",1364688000,,381,4.380281690140845
2546171,1,B000EXZKQW,"Any person who uses the phrase ""Paintballer"" or ""Paintballing"" might as well say Basketballing, footballing or baseballing.
KEEP GOING-NOTHING TO SEE HERE!",1364515200,,155,6.090909090909091
2546172,3,B000EXZKQW,"This movie made me want to go play paintball!  Its not Rob Corddry's best work but the ""documentary"" was entertaining and fun.",1363564800,,126,4.7272727272727275
2546173,5,B000EXZKQW,The movie was really good and it entertains definitely worth 5 stars can't believe i haven't heard of it before,1362268800,,111,4.6
2546174,5,B000EXZKQW,"this is one of my favorite movies ever!  great cast, funny topic.  i have watched this more than once. watch this!",1360540800,,114,4.380952380952381
2546175,1,B000EXZKQW,"... and I love the people involved and was ""in the mood"" to laugh. But it was horrible. Stay away.",1357171200,,98,3.95
2546176,1,B000EXZKQW,"I really wanted to like this movie but I didn't, just like the other people who gave this movie one star. I expected a lot more considering the cast. I laughed a few times throughout the movie but most of the time I was checking the clock to see how long the movie had until it finished. Don't watch this film and spend 90 minutes doing something else.",1308441600,,352,4.1911764705882355
2546177,5,B000EXZKQW,"This is one of my favorite ""docu-comedies"" in the vein of Spinal Tap and Best In Show. If you know anything about the sport of paintball, you'll see this movie as a hoot, with all the right representations of the funny aspects of the sport and the people who play it but, of course, exaggerated to make it even funnier.  I (and my paintball playing son) watch it every so often just to crack up.  I believe you will too!",1305849600,,420,4.2375
2546178,1,B000EXZKQW,"it is a silly topic and is directed in the same way.  you would think it would be clever but it isn't.  it is almost as though the filmmakers were so satisfied that they came up with an idea they forgot that they actually had to make a movie about it, much less write a screenplay.",1301356800,,281,4.0
2546179,4,B000EXZKQW,"My friends and I saw this movie when it came out in the theater. There were about 8 of us and perhaps 10 ""non paintballers"" in the theater. We were busting up all over the place having a great time with all the stuff only a baller would get. The other people in the room were not sure what was going on ;)
  Now every time we go out of town for a tournament we bring a copy of BOBBY with us and it plays all night long !!!!

  This is a great movie!!! The only thing that keeps it out of the 5 star is the language is a bit strong.",1279670400,2,531,3.705357142857143
2546180,4,B000EXZKQW,This is a great movie for those who get it. Go into it knowing that you're going to be watching a Mockumentary and you won't be disappointed.,1217980800,,141,4.2592592592592595
2546181,5,B000EXZKQW,"I couldn't stop laughing at the review below actually criticizing this move for paintball technicalities.  This movie is a fantastic, very smart comedy making fun of the ""sport"" of paintball.  Genius writing and a talented cast combine for one of the best movies I've seen in years.",1213660800,,282,4.9787234042553195
2546182,5,B000EXZKQW,"If you have trouble discerning a mockumentary from a documentary then you should by all means stay away from this movie. . . I'm looking at you Randy Givens, Mr. I-gave-this-movie-1-star-because-I-thought-it-was-real. But if your brain is working above the level of a newborn then by all means check out this hilarious mockumentary. If you're a fan of The Daily Show, The Upright Citizens Brigade or Human Giant, then this is a must-see treat for you. Rob Riggle will have you in stitches.",1206576000,4,489,4.975609756097561
2546183,5,B000EXZKQW,It took me a few minutes to figure out that this wasn't a real documentary. This film features a wry kind of humor and its low budget demeanor is actually a plus. I thought it was very entertaining and at times hilarious. This one is 5 stars all the way.,1197590400,,255,4.12
2546184,3,B000EXZKQW,The budget for this movie wasn't high at all.  Keeping that in mind it wasn't bad but some of the acting had room for improvement.  There are a couple funny parts in the movie that a few friends and I bring up now and then.  I am a paintball player.,1189987200,,249,3.94
2546185,1,B000EXZKQW,"This was really disappointed. I have been playing paintball for the past four years and have played for over 600 hours. As for paintball movies, I have seen a LOT of them (more than anyone that I know, and I know a lot of ballers). This might be the worst ""paintball"" video that I have seen. Even if it wants to be called a ""movie"", it is really bad in comparison to what is out there (seen thousands of those, most much better than this). Sure, the filming is technically pretty good, but that's about it. If you love paintball, don't waste your time. If you're thinking about playing paintball, don't waste your time. Try something like ""Cereal Killerz"", ""Road to World Cup"", or ""Heroes for a Day"". Or just scan TV listings for ""paintball"" -- some of them are NOT what you should do for safety reasons, but at least they will be more entertaining.",1179273600,,849,4.448717948717949
2546186,4,B000EXZKQW,"Kind of funny, a little dry, some paintballers may not like it, but I thought it was funny.",1175385600,2,91,4.111111111111111
2546187,5,B000EXZKQW,"This is laugh-out-loud-till-it-hurts type funny. That being said, it's not for everybody.  The guy who said it was ""crude"" clearly doesn't get it, which I can see; some people not getting the humor.  I've watched this movie with people who (like myself) laughed non-stop, from start to finish.  I've also watched it with people who didn't register more than a chuckle the entire movie (I kept looking over and saying, ""That doesn't make you laugh?  You don't find that funny??  Really???"")

Lurking beneath the apparent ""crudeness"" lies some very intelligent, biting humor.  Fans of the TV show ""The Office"" will find a lot to like here.  It's really more clever than it is crude.  You'll need to watch this movie 3 or 4 times to catch every joke and funny line, which is the true sign of a transcendent comedy.  When you consider that 95% of the jokes are improv, that makes it even more impressive.  We need more movies like this and fewer (none?) ""______ Movie"" movies.",1174262400,3,972,4.726190476190476
2546188,5,B000EXZKQW,"Ask anyone who has had the opportunity to see this film as it meandered its way through the indie festivals, and they will tell you that this hilarious little gem has kept many an audience in stitches and should have found distribution a long time ago.  Not only is the material fresh and off-the-cuff with improvisation-o-plenty, but the story is one that is easy to relate too while at the same time being so absurdly over-the-top that one cannot help but let out a snicker at how paintball gets the full mockumentary treatment, though in a unique style differentiated from those of the ""Guest"" lineage (Spinal Tap, Mighty Wind,Best In Show, etc...).  If you are a fan of improv then you will appreciate the pedigree of this cast, many of which have gone through the Upright Citizens Brigade Comedy Troupe, and have also made appearances on Comedy Central, SNL, and MAD TV.  The talent is there, and these folks use it to their fullest - so much so that you focus on the characters, and not the shoe-string budget that put this film into the ranks of an instant cult favorite.",1153008000,13,1078,4.633507853403142
2546189,5,B000EXZKQW,"I saw this movie last fall at the Oxford, MS Film Festival and it was hilarious.  It shows that no matter how much (or little) money you have to back up a movie, if the people are good enough then they can carry it.  I loved this movie and will buy it they day it comes out.",1146700800,,274,3.789473684210526
8115720,1,B000EXZKQW,"There was A LOT of potential for a comedy-rich ""mockumentary,"" but it fell flat. It fell flat because the attempts at humor - even awkward or ironic humor - fell flat. In the first 45 minutes, I think I may have chuckled once, which for a comedy means you're wasting my time.

Perhaps the makers of this film should have watched the paintballing episode of the British comedy ""Spaced."" Now THAT is how you apply humor to an activity that some people take overly serious.",1518566400,,470,4.529411764705882
8115721,3,B000EXZKQW,Funny as hell,1481241600,,13,3.6666666666666665
8115722,2,B000EXZKQW,"I would only rent this once in SD so you could say you saw it for humor.  Aside from that SO NOT PAINTBALL.
I am pretty sure that not even a minute of this movie was even supervised by a noob from a grade b crap paintball field.",1476576000,,228,3.75
8115723,5,B000EXZKQW,"I had seen the movie back when it first came out and found it hilarious. Tried to hunt it down but only could find it on amazon and for a reasonable price.

If you play paintball regularly you will just laugh at the horribly bad parts as well as the hilariously spot on representation of some of the most idiotic notions that it presents. Continuity is awefull, but that is all the movies fault.

Overall this is exactly what I was looking for and I got what I wanted.",1475452800,,468,4.247191011235955
8115724,3,B000EXZKQW,Decent movie not great. came highly recommended and it did not live up to the hype,1473724800,,82,4.1875
