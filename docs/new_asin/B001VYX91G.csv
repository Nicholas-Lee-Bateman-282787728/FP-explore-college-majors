8346807,4,B001VYX91G,"This DVD basically shows the direction that the son of Wally Jay, Leon Jay, has taken small circle jujitsu. With less emphasis on jujitsu and more on pressure point strikes and touch knockouts.",1283299200,2,193,4.878787878787879
8346808,2,B001VYX91G,"I felt that the most valuable material in the dvd was the fulcrum, lever and base combined with the two way action. Unfortunately, there are very few close ups clearly showing the wrist action and hand placements. The instruction would have been much more effective with close ups and slow motion.

I was disappointed with the focus of the dvd being more on Leon Jay's emphasis on the pressure points striking without providing any real instruction on that topic. I did not see the connection between the title of the dvd and what the emphasis of the instruction that is actually on the dvd is. The title could have just as easily been Leon Jay shows off his knowledge of pressure points and knocks a few people out.

However, the real value and a special treat on this dvd is a short biography of Professor Wally Jay. Well done and worth the price of the dvd alone.",1278288000,4,866,4.509554140127388
