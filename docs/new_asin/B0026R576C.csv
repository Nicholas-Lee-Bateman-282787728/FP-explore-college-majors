3856776,5,B0026R576C,"Dance Fools, Dance is an excellent pre-Code film that packs so much action and character development into its scant 82 minutes that it's truly remarkable! The plot moves along very well without going too slow or too fast and I was never once bored. The sets are well done and I liked both the choreography and the cinematography. The acting is very convincing, too! Gable and Crawford had such chemistry together, just as the others have noted! The musical score, while not extensive since this is certainly no musical, enhances the film as well. And, since this is a pre-Code, the film doesn't shy away from showing the tougher side of life with people being knocked down the ladder from ""society"" to near-poverty not to mention the lives and ways of gangsters in the days of bootlegging and more.

When the action starts, we quickly meet wealthy socialite Bonnie Jordan (Joan Crawford) and her boyfriend Bob (Lester Vail) who are dancing with a huge party on Bonnie's father's (William Holden) yacht late one evening; they are enjoying the high life before the huge stock market crash of 1929. Bonnie especially but Bob also enjoys love ""on approval."" Unfortunately, of course, the market crashes soon after and Bonnie's father dies as a result of the stress; this forces Bonnie and her brother Rodney (William Bakewell) to find new lives--working! Bonnie tries hard to keep her spirits up and finds a job as a cub (entry-level) reporter at a newspaper while Rodney gets involved bootlegging with his pal Wally (Earle Foxe) and the tough-as-nails gangster/bootlegger Jake Luva (Clark Gable).

It also isn't long before even more complications develop. Jake wants to grab as much bootlegging business as he can from a rival gangster and he uses Rodney to make sure he gets that business. And when there's a gangland style massacre and Bonnie's reporter friend Bert Scranton (Cliff Edwards) wants to cover at least part of the story even more happens that held my attention!

Of course there's more to the plot than just what I've given you here and I won't write much more to avoid giving away spoilers! Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how everything plays out.

Look also for solid performances by Natalie Moorhead as Della; Russell Hopton as Whitey; Purnell Pratt as Parker; Hale Hamilton as Selby and Joan Marsh as Sylvia. Ann Dvorak has an uncredited role as a chorus girl.

I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; people who like pre-Code films in general will not be disappointed.",1377561600,3,2524,4.819861431870669
3856777,2,B0026R576C,"No.  It's Clark Gable.  And Joan Crawford.  Again, Crawford is no dancer, though she makes the best of an early-talkie role. And these early talkies usually had some musical moment(s) tossed in.  I don't know what on God's green earth ever really propelled her to iconic status or stardom, but it sure wasn't her dancing.  This is living proof.

So rich dad dies of a heart attack faster than his stocks can crumble and rich Joan and her brother, whoever he his, have to make a living.  She gets a job as a reporter (don't we all do that when times are hard?) and he winds up rum-running for Gable, aka Jake Luva. Bullets fly at some point.

For 1930 audiences this must have been a treat, but for hard-core film afficionado's, it's a dud.  Both Joan and whoever her brother is resort to silent film acting technique that is embarassing to watch.  (The brother, especially).  Whoever plays her brother fell by the wayside and Joan was taking no prisoners.  Though she is just as bad.

Gable is the only one who redeems himself in this mess, and he isn't a star yet.  You know he's a gangster because his name ends in a vowel.  He's swarthy and uncaring to his girl(s), the way a gangster is, supposedly, supposed to be.  But Luva (Gable) loves Bonnie Jordan (Crawford) and they do NOT wind up at the fade out.

Instead, all the other reporters in Bonnie Jordan's office applaud her as she ducks out of sight (watch it!) with the idiot lovestuck boy who had loved her all along.

Joan can't dance.  She can do a lot of things, but dancing is not one of them.",1336348800,,1557,4.4
3856778,4,B0026R576C,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) presents ""DANCE FOOL DANCE"" (1931) (82 min/B&W) -- Starring: Joan Crawford, Lester Vail, Cliff Edwards, William Bakewell, Clark Gable

Directed by Harry Beaumont

The plot and story line is set right after the carefree and things were never better, roaring 20s, during the early days of the Great Depression,  This is a clear message and cautionary note of how to endure these hard times.  The film is fast-paced and tightly-plotted never drags with its morality tale.

Crawford and Gable made it good. The supporting cast is good as well.

Within the tight length of the 80 minutes, all the characters are well developed, its story never seems rushed, and despite its many twists in plot, the audience is never left behind.

If you're a Joan Crawford fan, she absolutely brings her role to the forefront.  She was 27 years and almost unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work.  Remember she took home an Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the true sense of the word, a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herself.

Special footnote: -- Before this film Joan Crawford told people not to have affairs with their leading men until they made three films together. She and Clark Gable had only made two together, but they started to have an affair during this filming. Afterwards Crawford said she had to eat her words, but that they tasted sweet.

3856779,4,B0026R576C,"Besides a few bit/uncredited parts in some silents, this is Clark Gable's first feature film production with Joan Crawford. Clark Gable plays the role of Jake Luva and Joan is Bonnie Jordan, a young girl who has to go to work after the stock market leaves her family penniless. This is one of those rare pre-code films that include risque dialog and themes. In this picture she goes from victim to victor, yet that road she traveled wasn't easy and wasn't smooth. There were many sparks that Joan and Clark Gable set off together in this film which made it memorable. I also love how youthful and young Clark Gable looks without his signature mustache. ""Dance, Fools, Dance"" is certainly a keeper that belongs in the collection of any Joan Crawford fan. The movie is 80 mins./black and white/produced by MGM and was released in 1931.",1258675200,2,833,4.712328767123288
3856780,4,B0026R576C,"I am reviewing the product itself here, not the wisdom of paying this particular price for that product. This is a Warner Archive product. It is a DVD-R with no scene selections or chapter stops. You may only go forward or backwards in ten minute increments. Furthermore no special restoration has been done for this release.

This film is actually about 3.5/5. Not great, but good enough to keep your interest. It is historical for being the initial teaming of Joan Crawford and Clark Gable, although Gable is sixth or seventh billed at this point. Don't expect Gable the gallant cad in this one - here he is pure cad.

The film is an unremarkable morality tale about the follies of the very wealthy spoiling their children even into adulthood to the point where they complain about having to ""get up in the middle of the night (9 AM) to eat breakfast."" When Wall Street crashes, dad dies from the shock and Bonnie Jordan (Joan Crawford) and her brother are left penniless. Bonnie chooses to break into newspaper reporting, but her brother chooses a less honest option which brings him into contact with Gable the gangster. After her close friend, reporter Bert Scranton (Cliff Edwards), is shot to death, Bonnie decides to go undercover as a dancer at Gable's nightclub to try to get to the bottom of the murder. She solves the crime, but at great personal cost.

The best parts of this film are watching Joan Crawford in a dance number and watching the great chemistry Crawford and Gable have together. You get bigger doses of Crawford and Gable together in ""Possessed"", which was made later this same year - 1931. I also recommend that film for hardcore fans of the precodes and of Crawford. As for Clark Gable, he has to wait until he manhandles Norma Shearer in ""A Free Soul"" before he catapults to true stardom.

As for audio and video quality, the audio quality is quite good while the video quality is a bit soft looking, although overall clarity and contrast is pretty good. It pretty much looks like a direct copy of my old VHS tape of this movie that was released in the late 1990's. Overall I'm quite satisfied with this particular Warner Archive entry.",1251590400,5,2166,4.662303664921466

I don't understand why, this movie is very engaging and I have enjoyed it very much. It is clear that Joan in this movie is transitioning from her 20's flapper girl image to her 30's shop girl makes good image. The story is very interesting, and my only criticism of this film is the gun fight scene.
