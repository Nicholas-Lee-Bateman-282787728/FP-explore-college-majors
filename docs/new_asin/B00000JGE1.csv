1232696,2,B00000JGE1,"Once In A Lifetime was always my favorite Danielle Steel book, I thought the movie would be pretty good like her others.  Unfortunately, the movie is dissapointing and boring.  Unlike most of her other movies, this one is loosly based on the novel and some very important details are removed from the story.  The result is a fairly meaningless movie that I only finished watching because I purchased it.  Had I seen it on tv, I would have turned it off.  Don't waste your time on this movie if you love the book, it's not worth the 2 hours out of your life for this one.  The only good thing I can say is at least the character's names are the same and they at least have the same roles as in the book.",1368057600,,702,4.201492537313433

After watching this movie, it makes you stop to think about who and what's really important in your life.  A DEFINITE MUST SEE!  You will not be disappointed.  As a matter of fact, I keep looking to see when it will be on again.
What makes this movie so special . . is once you become involved, you almost stop to wonder - this is exactly what I want to have a ONCE IN A LIFETIME experience with someone special.",1073001600,19,513,4.3578947368421055
1232701,3,B00000JGE1,"For those Rex Smith fans out there, He is in this, but it is a short lived role(literally).  He is charming and handsome as ever as Jeffrey Fields, husband to Lindsay Wagner(Bionic Woman), who plays Daphne.
Barry Bostwick, most known for his role of Brad, in Rocky Horror Picture Show, plays the doctor who falls in love with Daphne.
The story starts with the present day, Christmas Day, and when Daphne gets hit by a car, the story unravels and goes back to when she lost her first husband, Jeffrey, and her daughter in a house fire.  She gives birth to Jeffrey's son, who turns out to be deaf.  Daphne becomes a famous author, and raises her son on her own.
This is the first Danielle Steel movie I've watched, I did read the book a long time ago.  It is one of my favorites by her.  While I don't read her anymore because of sophmoric and formulatic plots, I still enjoy romantic movies with happy endings.
I really wanted to watch this for the snippet of Rex Smith as I have been a fan for more than half my life.  It turned out to be a nice story, with the usual Steel plot twists with tragedy(even a glimpse of the twin towers), romance, drama, and tie it all up with a happy ending.",1006732800,18,1189,4.285714285714286

7912215,4,B00000JGE1,"Lindsay Wagner plays Daphne Fields, who lies in a hospital bed recalling the moments of her life that led her to such a state. While happily married, her husband and daughter are tragically killed in a house fire, leaving the pregnant Daphne alone. After the birth of her son, she manages to support the pair of them by becoming a successful novelist. Despite her success and the love of her son, she still feels unfulfilled romantically, but amazingly enough her recuperation from a car accident in the hospital may provide that final piece in the puzzle of her life. ...Once in a Lifetime ( Danielle Steel's Once in a Lifetime )",1504569600,,630,4.684684684684685
