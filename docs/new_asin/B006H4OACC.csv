8498164,4,B006H4OACC,"A lonely, disgruntled truck driver travelling miles and miles lugging logs across South American borders. A woman in need of transport. A sweet-faced tomatillo-headed baby with eyes darker and rounder than an 8-ball...

Las Acacias is simple, sensitive, and realistic in its presentation. The drama gradually unfolds as things do in real life. The dialogue is sparse and the story is told mainly through the expressions of the leading characters who seem to be portrayed by a pair of naturally adept non-actors. If one counts the baby preciosa, she's a natural too who steals just about every scene whenever she appears. In a world full of big-budget movies stuffed with hyperactivity, violence, and computer-generated effects, Las Acacias proves that modest productions can and do make more of an impact on viewers with a simple, touching tale. The pace may be a little slow for most viewers, especially those accustomed to action and excessive drama, but this small production indie film delivers a lot of heart if given the chance.",1506038400,,1034,5.118343195266272
8498165,5,B006H4OACC,"Amazing! Before a word is said, you just have to surrender to this movie about a lonely truck driver who gives a ride to a woman and her baby girl. He starts out ignoring both; he winds up wishing they wouldn't reach her final destination. A work of art we hope to see more of in the future.",1395187200,2,291,4.0344827586206895
8498166,4,B006H4OACC,"I read rave reviews about this movie in ""Film Comment"" magazine and ended up ordering a copy through Amazon's UK website. It's a terrific film, subdued but lyrical. Although very little is said, you come to know the two characters fairly well by the end. It also helps that the third actor is an adorablicious five month old baby with the most winsome smile. A real gem of a film. It's a shame it hasn't had a US release yet.",1371081600,,425,4.325
8498167,4,B006H4OACC,"Moving human story, heart-warming. . .

Very little happens here in a physical sense: a driver is transporting a Guaranee woman and her illegitimate baby to Buenos Aires. They start as strangers and try to keep it that way.

But they are both very good people, and very slowly and subtly become attracted to the warmth and humanity of each other.

There are no tricks with the camera, no flashbacks, no ""artsiness"". Just good human experience.

I am incurable romantic, and i found the movie very heart-warming.",1367452800,,511,4.839080459770115
8498168,4,B006H4OACC,"Argentina has furnished me with two favorite films: ""The Dancer and the Thief"" and ""The Secret in their Eyes,"" now I'll add a third. ""Las Acacias"" seems to be a Chick Flick, at least our opinions were divided along gender lines at this screening for the 2012 Seattle International Film Festival. One fellow (you know who you are!) likened it to watching paint dry, while a gal and I were rhapsodizing over the subtle hint of a smile or the gradual lift of someone's shoulders.

We are with Rubn, a long-haul truck driver who transports freshly cut timber from Asuncin del Paraguay to Buenas Aires. He has been paid to carry a passenger this time: Jacinta, a woman on her way to a new job at her mother's place of employment. To his dismay, she has a five-month-old daughter in her arms. He keeps his end of the bargain, but has a lot of misgivings.

For some of us, these things may seem delicious, for others, not so much:
  * To hear maybe five minutes total of dialogue in this entire 85-minute film.
  * To watch two solitary people gradually make attempts at conversation.
  * To admire the skill with which that baby was directed: her eyes always watched the person she was supposed to be looking at, never at the camera; she cried on cue; she slept on cue; and right after he yawned, she did too, just like people really do!
  * To examine the adult faces for any sign of emotion. It takes him over half a day to offer even a hint of a smile...and that's toward the baby and is barely a hint.
  * To smile when the world's cutest baby objects to his smoke, whereupon he opens his window and tosses out the cigarette.

Not only is that baby amazingly well directed, but they have managed to capture the tedium of long-haul trucking. This truck ride is notable in it's authenticity! To us gals, the ending was worth the time we spent watching that slow, slow thaw between two solitary people who clearly have been through some hard times.

I'll be glad when Amazon notifies me that the DVD is released with English captions. I know they exist because we had them for the film festival.",1350172800,,2090,4.43717277486911
