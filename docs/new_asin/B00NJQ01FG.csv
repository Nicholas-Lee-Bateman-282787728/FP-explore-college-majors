6666080,4,B00NJQ01FG,"Another great entry into the World Series film library. Though the bluray loses one star for only being 720p definition. And FYI, the correct aspect ratio is 1.78:1",1417132800,2,164,4.892857142857143
6666081,5,B00NJQ01FG,"The 2014 World Series Highlights film is a wonderful way to reflect on the topsy-turvy Giants' season.  As Bart Giamatti might have called it, a season that never ended.

In early June the Giants looked unbeatable but by the end of September they limped into the post season as a wild card without Matt Cain, Angel Pagan or Marco Scutaro.  Nobody picked them to win anything -- nobody except themselves and their fans.

In the Wild Card game vs. the Pirates. Brandon Crawford hit a grand slam to silence the crowd and Madison Bumgarner began his magical postseason with a complete game shutout.  The film then moves to the NLDS vs. the Nationals which featured one game that tied the longest post season game ever (18 innings staring Yusemeiro Petit and Brandon Belt), and another which showcased Hunter Pence's awesome catch against the right field wall at AT&T Park, as the Giants dismantled the team with the best regular season record in the National League.

Then the NLCS.  This was the fourth time the Giants have played the Cardinals for the National League Pennant and for the third time in a row the Giants came out on top.  The last couple of innings of game 5 were amazing -- Mike Morse's pinch hit home run to tie the game in the 8th and then Travis Ishikawa channeled Bobby Thompson to win the pennant with his 9th inning walk off home run.  Wow!

When the Giants won the 2012 World Series all the drama was in the NLDS and the NLCS -- the series itself was a quick 4 game sweep.  In 2014 we got a World Series brawl.  The Kansas City Royals, seemingly everyone's sweetheart, had breezed through the post season undefeated.  They had great defense, stole bases and their pitchers threw heat.  The Giants, we were told, had no chance.  The series went back and forth with momentum changing every few innings.  In game 4 the Giants turned a 4 run deficit into an 11-4 romp -- torture into triumph.  In game 5 Madison Bumgarner pitched his SECOND complete game shutout of the postseason (paging Clayton Kershaw) and the Giants looked set.

Game 6 in Kansas City brought back horrible memories of Anahiem in 2002: Rally Monkees, Dusty Baker handing the game ball to pitcher Russ Ortiz and the Giants blowing a 5-0 lead with only 8 outs remaining.  This time the result was equally horrible, but it hurt less as the Royals toasted the Giants 10-0.  The whole season came down to game 7.

1979 was the last time a team won World Series game 7 on the road.  In 2002 the Giants fell short but this time they had a weapon.  With a 3-2 lead, they brought out Madison Bumgarner who pitched 5 innings of shutout relief, capping one the greatest postseasons any pitcher has ever had.  The Giants won the game and the series -- the ghosts of 2002 have been exorcised.

The only thing about the film that made me sad was watching the Panda's last moments as a Giant.  Pablo Sandoval is a mixed blessing, but he always plays with enthusiasm.  Regardless of what he does, he will never be loved in Boston or anywhere else as much as he was loved in San Francisco.

Needless to say, this is a must have for any Giants fan.  Enjoy the memories of the season that never ended.",1416960000,44,3170,4.493006993006993
6666082,4,B00NJQ01FG,"Great Review, as usual with the A&E world series films, MLB does a great job covering the Giants' 3rd run to the WS title in 5 yrs. But it could have been better had they covered the Royals' miraculous run to the WS. Does not even bother to show even a portion of AL WC game, ALDS, or ALCS.",1416960000,3,290,3.9322033898305087
6666083,5,B00NJQ01FG,The San Francisco Giants win another World Series and the story is told on a beautiful Blu-ray. Can't ask for much more as far as content on a disc goes. Go Giants! (Excuse the biased nature of this review),1416355200,9,206,4.3076923076923075
6666084,4,B00NJQ01FG,"This seems to be along the same lines as the 2010 and 2012. They premiered it on FoxSports1. If it is the same one, Colin Hanks narrates the film. Since I would assume that they wouldn't give away the goods for free on tv, I can only hope that they have plenty of extras and possibly some interviews with the Royals players to see what both sides thought. But overall, like I said, if it is the same one they showed on TV, it will be a great buy.",1416268800,2,446,4.022471910112359
6666085,3,B00NJQ01FG,It would've been perfect if it was a 2-disc set like in 2012 and the second disc was the classic NLCS finale with Ishikawa's walk-off Home Run that put the Giants back in the World Series. It will be quite disappointing without it.,1416182400,5,231,4.395348837209302

6666095,2,B00NJQ01FG,"It was an amazing season and playoff run and deserved a better product to capture it.  This blu-ray disc is only in 720p and only contains about 2 hrs of material.  720p on a blu-ray disc?  720p would be fine back in say 2007, but in 2014?  That's an embarrassment.  The 2012 disc was also 720p, but at least they had 4+ hrs of content.

Compare to the previous years' single blu-ray WS discs:
2010 1080i 2+ hrs content

6666124,5,B00NJQ01FG,"Very good summary of the Giants regular season and all the twists and turns of the postseason that led to a world championship.  Good interviews with the players who made big plays and Bruce Bochy and Giants executives.
  Very inspirational. They don't necessarily have the most talent but I like the way they never give up.  One example I remember is during the 2012 regular season the Dodgers made a blockbuster trade and many people predicted they would win the pennant after that.  But instead they started losing and the Giants played a game where they trailed 8-0 going into the the ninth inning and scored nine runs in the bottom of the ninth to win the game and got hot after that and pulled away to clinch the pennant.  The Giants have been underdogs in every series during every one of their three postseason runs and every time have found some way to come out on top.\
  Above and beyond baseball, this DVD gives hope to those facing tough times or being in an underdog situation to keep going and not give up.",1419897600,2,1021,4.510869565217392

6666127,2,B00NJQ01FG,"As a lifelong die hard Giants fan, I'd only recommend buying this for someone who wants a visual record of what happened in 2014. Otherwise, this was a sleepy documentary that never found an emotional anchor a fan could grip. Very boring. The 2010 and 2012 movies were much, much better. This felt like it was phoned in. Very difficult at times to relive the drama of each big game. Very little use of Kruk & Kuip. Colin Hanks did a great job, but he had an empty, soulless script, which contributed to the mediocrity of this film.",1419724800,8,531,4.428571428571429

Kansas City. What happen to the ""Mid - Country"" Hospitality that folks talk about??? It sure wasn't treated to the
Giants in game one when the announcer was giving the Giants line up, the Royal's fans were drowning out the
voice of the announcers voice by singing out ""Royals Chants"" poor spoiled Royal fans. No class and I'm so glad
