4294191,5,B0049TC8HG,"Ice Road Truckers was okay, but this first season of IRT Deadliest Roads is downright crazy good. The ""roads"" are ridiculous.",1362787200,,125,5.0
4294192,4,B0049TC8HG,"i watched and liked the regular irt series,but deadliest roads was just a different seat of the pants experience,really enjoyed the drama,thriller,comedy(at times)and mystery.maybe the just edited out the love story?who knows?",1351382400,,226,6.09375
4294193,5,B0049TC8HG,This is a great 3 dvd set. Very entertaining and heart pounding action. Definately recommend for those who are IRT die hard fans. This is one your collection shouldnt do without.,1343779200,,178,4.774193548387097
4294194,5,B0049TC8HG,This show in my opinion is better than it's previous versions of a the same name just different location! It shows how far some of the characters will go to prove how brave they want to be and just how dangerous it is in a very remote location far removed from civilization and the cost of human life to do the kind of work these people do. I'd be kidding myself if I thought that anybody could do this and not hate themselves later and just because you driven a truck in these locations doesn't mean your bullet proof in a matter of speaking!,1337990400,,543,4.230769230769231
4294195,3,B0049TC8HG,"After watching seasons 1-4 of Ice Road Truckers in either northern Canada or the last seasons in Alaska, this was a letdown to be honest.  I really didn't know what I was getting, I just knew I enjoyed IRT, except for the 2nd half of Season 2 when Alex Debogorski had health issues that ended this run that season.  Being a huge fan of Alex, my favorite actor/real life trucker on the ice roads, I was really disappointed when halfway through the first episode he bowed out because of the crazy Delhi roads and two car crashes that weren't even his fault.  Can't say I blame him, Rick and Lisa had their close calls too, and I watched it through because Rick is a cut-up funny actor/trucker.  He and Alex definitely make the show, Hugh is too foul-mouthed, and the others kind of come and go throughout the seasons.  But, those ridiculous looking trucks they drove in India were over the top weird, I like to see them behind the wheel of a big 18-wheeler, not a engine mounted on sticks.  Guess I should have done my homework a bit more before purchasing this one, but I thought hey its IRT, can't go wrong, well you can...",1319500800,,1123,4.400966183574879
4294196,5,B0049TC8HG,"This really shows you what it's like to drive in India--there are no rules, other than you should generally drive on the left side of the road.  The drivers (Lisa, Rick, Dave, Alex) are diverse enough that their way of handling the insanity makes it interesting...though the insanity itself is interesting.  The ""what-if"" special effects are meant to add excitement and danger, but really, there was enough excitement and danger that it wasn't needed.  One of the drivers doesn't make it past the first day, and only one driver makes it to the end.  Along the way there are rockslides, avalanches, road closures, traffic jams, accidents, fights, breakdowns (mechanical and emotional), and always sketchy roads--usually with a massive drop off on one side.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Deadliest Roads Season 1 and have a new appreciation for these drivers, as well as a better understanding of what it's like to drive in India.

The one thing that is slightly annoying is that because it was taken straight from TV, minus the commercials, there is the recap that occurs after a commercial (for viewers who just tuned in while watching TV), yet because there was no commercial you get an unnecessary recap of what you just saw.  Yet, I still give it 5 starts because for the price I can tolerate it.  On the plus side, each segment of each episode is in a submenu, so you can go directly to a segment and you will know what happened beforehand due to the recap.

Just to recap, Ice Road Truckers Deadliest Roads Season i is interesting, exciting, and well worth watching.",1314489600,10,1567,4.774074074074074
4294197,5,B0049TC8HG,"Excellent program showing roads used to service the remote areas of India's
mountains. Amazing scenery within a good story and very reasonably priced.
I hope there will be no season 2, a wee too  scary.",1309132800,,202,4.771428571428571
4294198,5,B0049TC8HG,"Maybe it's because we can identify a little more with the ""un-icy"" roads, as far as having to drive on them, but the IRT series just got even better in my book!

Folks, if THESE truck drivers are are little anxious and scared of the ""deadliest"" roads here, you just KNOW that they are SUPER dangerous!

I haven't seen the entire series, but I will as soon as I get my DVD set. The offending words (and there are a LOT of them) will be bleeped out, so the entire family (except the really young kids) will be able to watch without a problem.

Knowing these series, there should be some interesting bonus features on the DVD set, too. Gotta say, though, I DO wish they had left out the smoking - totally unnecessary!

Your drive to work won't seem so bad after watching IRT - Deadliest Roads!",1304640000,3,790,4.3175675675675675
4294199,5,B0049TC8HG,"THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! (FOR RELEASING THIS 5 STAR ENTERTAINMENT MASTERPIECE.)

Whichever genius decided to expand the concept of Ice Road Truckers to this format is EXACTLY THAT: A GENIUS! THIS SIMPLY BLOWS THE ORIGINAL SERIES AWAY!!!

Frankly, the IRT original series was beginning to bog down badly with the same tiresome theme: ""Will Lisa ever fit in?"" Watching these three drivers, including Lisa, negotiate possibly the highest, tightest and generally the worst excuses for roads on the planet will have you squirming in your chair and sucking in audible tight breaths as you frequently peer 1000 feet straight down with no safety rails.

This is daredevil fare at it's very finest. It's called the ""Road of Skeletons"" because a driver DIES while driving on it every 4 1/2 MINUTES!

SIGN UP. THIS WILL QUICKLY BECOME A FAVORITE YOU'LL SHARE WITH FRIENDS AND ONE THAT STANDS UP TO REPEATED ""LUMP IN YOUR STOMACH/LUMP IN YOUR THROAT"" VIEWING!",1296259200,20,955,4.987421383647798

4294203,5,B0049TC8HG,"Unreal and totally wild!! I give so much credit to the drivers who made it! I don't blame Alex Debogorski one bit for going home. He followed his instincts, and with such a large family, it made sense. I'm a really big fan of IRT and now IRT Deadliest Roads! It's a trip, and worth watching!",1410998400,,291,4.214285714285714
4294204,5,B0049TC8HG,"This is a wild ride of a show , I like the drivers and what they go through delivering supplies in India on the high mountain passes. It also shows you how rude people can be on the roads and explains why many truck drivers get ulcers. After watching this you will know why but it also shows how life is like in India and what overpopulation looks like.",1407542400,,353,4.130434782608695
4294205,5,B0049TC8HG,"This season of IRT is my favorite, because it is so hard to watch. Very exciting and frightening at the same time. I recommended it to people all the time.",1402963200,,155,4.2
4294206,3,B0049TC8HG,"Seems like the footage is of the same continuous roads in the Himalayan mountains.  My favorite, Alex Debogorski, quit and went back home before he even got out of the Indian town due to fear of a mob attack.  Can't blame him at all.",1381276800,,233,4.2727272727272725
4294207,5,B0049TC8HG,I couldn't believe what these truckers actually drive or what they drive thru.  Absolutely amazing and I highly recommend this to everyone.,1375747200,,139,5.318181818181818

4294209,5,B0049TC8HG,Great to be able to purchase this package.  TV programs here in NZ is limited to what the channels choose to show.  We got Season 2 here but not Season 1!  Good to be able to watch all the episodes back to back.  Thanks Amazon.,1364515200,,227,3.977777777777778

8419282,5,B0049TC8HG,"Very much enjoyed watching the Ice Road Truckers driving these narrow mountain roads. They dodged vehicles all along the one lane roads with the two way traffic in the mountains, with steep drop-offs at the edge of their wheels!  It's amazing to see how the people in that country disregard safety while driving thru mobs of people & vehicles.  Very interesting and entertaining. Beautiful scenery, too.",1457049600,,403,5.090909090909091
8419283,5,B0049TC8HG,"This side-series of Ice Road Truckers puts the drivers into a very foreign (and more stressful than ever) environment, from the crazy, over-crowded big city, at first, to narrow, unpaved, avalanche-prone Himalayan roads, populated by a continuous stream of rediculously-aggressive car and truck drivers. 'Very enjoyable viewing.",1446508800,,328,6.0
