6481842,5,B00LFHYWLA,"What a wonderful ""walk down memory lane"". I especially like the ""Chicken Plucker"" (not the actual name- you'll have to watch the disk to understand). This is more than just Halloween fun for all ages. It can be viewed whenever a smile is needed. I highly recommend this collection.",1412294400,3,281,4.755102040816326

6481844,5,B00LFHYWLA,This DVD has a lot of Halloween Cartoons featuring Woody Woodpecker. The  only one  I  don't care for is one that features Oswald the Lucky Rabbit as that one wasn't all that good but the rest were. You Should get it.,1410393600,,217,4.2439024390243905
6481845,4,B00LFHYWLA,"For someone like me, who loves classic cartoons and just can't get enough of Halloween, this is a real treat.  Although much of the material here has been previously available (in Universal's excellent Woody Woodpecker and Friends Vols. 1 & 2), there are some new-to-video cartoons here as well.  Franken-stymied, Witch Crafty and Phantom of the Horse Opera, all from early 60's, were all new to me.  Most fans agree that the original series was past its prime by then, but I still find the cartoons from that time lots of colorful fun.

There are also 3 cartoons, comprising a single half-hour episode, of the early 2000's revival show.  While certainly not as irreverent or funny as ""classic"" Woody, they're still pretty good.  A bonus black & white Oswald short, Wax Works (also carried over from the previously-mentioned set), may not quite fit in, but it's a wonderful and genuinely spooky short that could serve to introduce younger viewers to classic animation.

The best part of the collection is a half-hour episode of The Woody Woodpecker Show, with creator Walter Lantz as host.  Although a couple of the cartoons within the program aren't Halloween-themed, the wrap-around live-action/animation segments are.  And best of all, ""Woody's Halloween Spook-a-nanny"" cartoon is an absolute blast.  I've been using it as part of my own Halloween cartoon collection for many years.  The episode was is also available in one of the Universal sets (I know I sound like I keep plugging them. . .but seriously, as of this writing they are under 20 bucks each, you need to have them!).

Video and audio quality are very good, although the aforementioned 3 new 60's shorts aren't quite as sharp as the previously-available ones.  There are optional English and Spanish subtitles.  All in all, this is a fun addition to any Halloween gathering that includes kids and/or nostalgic adults.  Enjoy!",1409616000,15,1892,5.0

8665570,5,B00LFHYWLA,"Some of the other reviewers tell us WHAT is on this Woody Woodpecker collection.
I used to watch these at my local theater back in the '50s, squeezed in between 3
movies at Saturday Triple Feature Matinees, and in B&W through the time I joined
the military in the late 'sixties. Now that I'm in MY sixties, it's time to watch them in
Technicolor! Maybe THIS collection [and the other one I bought] will convince me to
buy the Holiday Collection... or more.",1499212800,,456,4.506024096385542

8665576,3,B00LFHYWLA,There's really only one episode on this DVD that has anything to do with Halloween.,1446508800,,83,4.6
8665577,5,B00LFHYWLA,"""Guess who?"" This disc is an excellent mix of Woody Woodpecker and his gang from Universal's Walter Lantz archive, to share with both children and adults at Halloween! It includes a trio of shorts from the (new) Woody Woodpecker Show, which was one of the last good toons on FoxKids, aside from Digimon, to my good tastes in good toons, and the only non-Anime toon on the block, before the block kicked the bucket in 2002. It also has the original series' Halloween episode from 1964, which was a happy AND sad year in toon history (happy for Mary Poppins and Rudolph's big debuts, and sad for the Looney Tunes' golden age & Rocky and Bullwinkle coming to an end), and this included the only original Woody cartoon made for TV; the Spook-A-Nanny Party (if Mary Poppins will pardon the pun). Also in this disc are 2 shorts never before on DVD; Monster of Ceremonies (1966) and Phantom of the Horse Opera (1961), and 3 others that have been on DVD before; Witch Crafty (1955), Franken-Stymied (1961, and was in one of the old TV shows on the 3-disc DVD collections from '07 and '08), and Wax Works (1934, starring Oswald the Lucky Rabbit; his shorts made by Universal still belong with them, as his original 26 are back with Disney, whether they've been found or not). If your kids never saw any real film in Black-and-white before, you should let them know that Woody's old Halloween show has Black-and-white wraparound footage, with the shorts in color, as most of Oswald's shorts, by Disney AND Universal, are in Black-and-white. Just as most of the old shorts in Woody's Christmas DVD were filmed in 2-strip Technicolor, since Disney had the full rights to full-Technicolor at the time they were made. You won't be sorry with this Halloween collection, since the (new) Woody Woodpecker Show finally gets to be on DVD in the USA with this release, and the Christmas one, too! Ha-ha-ha-HAA-ha!; and a happy Halloween to y'all!",1445817600,7,1926,4.718100890207715
