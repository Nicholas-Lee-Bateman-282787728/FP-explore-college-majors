7848542,5,6303484018,"I have been enquiring in to nature of the self for last 10 years. I have read number of eastern religious books but nothing stands before calrity with which J.Krishnamurti solves many issues faced by serious religious person.

I would recommend this to any one intrested in knowing what is beyond limited human mind.",1140480000,13,316,4.851851851851852
7848543,4,6303484018,"It is easy for some to get lost in the work of David Bohm or J. Krishnamurti. Yet a mind which is unreceptive to this sort of openly vulnerable probing will likely find a slow, boring, and  pretentious-appearing discourse. Such a passive perception is merely the unfortunate residue image, an assumption that these discussions between Bohm and Krishnamurti (and incidentally, the listener) are only intellectual entertainment. Of course, overlooking or misjudging these works is tragically unfortunate considering the uniquely rare sort of people Krishnamurti and Bohm were, with a penetrating clarity of thought and command of language. The problem with Krishnamurti's countless works isn't principally in anything which he says, but rather in the audience which happens to be listening, participating in his inquiry. There is little doubt that a patient mind will be easily absorbed and fascinated by what Krishnamurti has thought about the shattered rut in which mankind has found itself. However, a mind must be supremely patient to follow these discussions wherever they may go, which is frequently into the minutest of epistemological and linguistic details. For much of the western world, this thoroughness often poses a problem, of course appearing ""aimless"" or ""unconstructive"" by contrast to western thought.

Since the deaths of both Bohm and Krishnamurti, human minds appear to be moving ever more quickly today than ever before, the barrage of cultural influences bearing very strongly upon the individual, as there is an ongoing cultivation of a certain direction of thought. Bohm and Krishnamurti's interest is in the anatomy of thinking. The chatter of thought occurs so very fast, always gliding over deep assumptions, unpercieved notions that form the foundations of what we think we know. That is where Krishnamurti goes in the majority of his talks, he peers into the mechanism, into the structure. David Bohm, a uniquely articulate man, seems to make it all more open and accessible to minds of the west. Krishnamurti at times may seem to be a mysctic, an idealist, a nihilist- perceptions which are not precise.

One who has read David Bohm or J. Krishnamruti can easily understand that the intention of the talks are innately organic and human, deeply concerned with the pain of other people. Krishnamurtis' goal, I believe, was total freedom for mankind, which to him mean from the obtuseness, illogicalness and mortal dangers of human thinking. The areas traversed here are enormous, the wording itself often difficult, as limits of language and expression are apparrent. A capacity for unrestrained inward observation is core to understanding not only one's own pain, but the very structure and fallibility of thinking itself.

It is not for me to say whether or not these works are important or essential. One can only say that these talks help to break open one's inner assumptions, and see into the complex relationship of thinking and reality. Depending on one's state of mind, it is not very difficult to understand this material, and this DVD is certainly not only for the intellectual or ""smart"" person. In fact, this work will be often lost on the intellectual. No matter what one's education is, the capacity to hear Bohm and Krishnamurti lies in the status of one's sensitivity and concern.",1138492800,25,3326,5.199626865671642
7848544,1,6303484018,"Five hours of three pseudo-intellectuals sitting around carrying on a conversation with each other, none of whom have even the slightest clue what the other one is talking about.  Unintentionally funny and boring at the same time, it makes a great party flick or gag gift idea for your snooty, cerebral friends.  Don't worry about the five hour length, as the challenge is to see who can stand to view it beyond even the first hour.  But it is filmed in color!",1137542400,5,460,4.585365853658536
7848545,5,6303484018,"It was wonderful to watch Krishnamurti on video for the first time, it's much better to actually see and hear him speak rather than just reading the dry lines in a book.
I have to say, though, that Shainberg was totally clueless, and Bohm, even though he had some great points and insights, is so timid that he looks like if you said ""boo"" he'd wet his pants.
Krishnamurti guides them through the discussion very adeptly and comes to the conclusion of what exactly is ""enlightenment"" or ""emptiness"" spoken of in Buddhism and Hinduism.",1088035200,4,534,4.691489361702128
7848546,5,6303484018,"K, Dr Bohm and Dr. Shainberg investigate the nature of thought, which unfolds itself though the discussion. Dr. Bohm is instrumental in bringing out the meaning in K's insightful statements. The discussion flows through  the inquiry of thought into the possibility of a completely transformed  mind, and hence humanity. A treat for anyone interested in finding out what  this whole mess around and within us is about. Not for someone who wants an  answer, but for someone who is deeply interested in the inquiry, or the  nature of it.",938044800,29,534,4.955056179775281
