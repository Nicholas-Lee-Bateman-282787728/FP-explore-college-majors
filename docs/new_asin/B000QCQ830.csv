So lets start with who is the girl on the cover?  Did you see her for even one second in the movie because last time I checked SHE WASNT IN IT.  That should hint to you the lack of intelligence that was put into this movie.  I could point out atleast 200 things wrong or incredibly stupid in the film.  For example, one of the most unreal scenes being the drive by with a musket scene.  A MUSKET. For all that is holy where did they get the funding for this movie?!?  Who let these people out into the open and thought it was ok.  The sad reality is that everyone involved in this movie probably thought their careers were going to take off, especially goofus boy on the cover there.  So if you're looking for a laugh then yes, please watch but its not worth $15. Find someone who has it because god knows we don't need a part two coming out.",1223078400,4,990,4.010204081632653
8195473,5,B000QCQ830,"Honorable Men a police drama that gives the feel of watching a reality based
tv show. It has the slant of a foreign film rarely seen in the US.
The acting is real, the characters could be your next door nieghbors.
A true look a life.",1205971200,,233,4.086956521739131
8195474,5,B000QCQ830,I rather liked the movie.  I thought that the movie and the music that was in the movie was pretty decent.,1180137600,,106,4.0476190476190474
8195475,5,B000QCQ830,"I very much enjoyed ""Honorable Men.""  I found it just the right balance between drama/romance and action.  The music was excellent and left me singing ""No, I'm not a hero"" for days.  I would highly recommend this film.",1180137600,,218,4.684210526315789
8195476,1,B000QCQ830,"If this movie was made to be serious, it is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies of all time. The lack of acting ability of the star is exceeded only by his lack of writing ability. There is a lot of this movie that doesn't make any sense.

If this movie was made as comedy, it would probably help to be drinking heavily before one views it.",1180051200,4,346,4.0144927536231885
