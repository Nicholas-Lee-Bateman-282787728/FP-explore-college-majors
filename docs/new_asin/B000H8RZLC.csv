Seems like there's always a battle between who owns what land depending upon the natural resources on it. It doesn't matter who owned or lived on it for generations either. Whoever has the politcal pull, money, or any other influence, they win. The original people and natural resources lose. Made me sad to watch this.",1482364800,,428,4.571428571428571
8137644,4,B000H8RZLC,"If you want an inside view on the implications of the drought in the West this is a great film. It shows the tensions between endangered species, agriculture and native people's rights. Who's need for water should be primary? Is there a way they can all survive given the water shortage. A very balanced film it doesn't take a side but you'll have enough information that you can form your own opinion.",1442361600,,402,4.597222222222222
8137645,4,B000H8RZLC,"This video is a few years old now, and was completed before the recent agreement between the several parties, so it needs a follow-up.  It does a good job of interviewing spokespeople for both the upstream irrigators and the Yurok tribe near the mouth of the Klamath River.  However, it would have been more complete if it had included interviews with members of the Hupa tribe (which did not sign on to the recent agreement) and had their own concerns about the conditions on the Trinity River, and the Karuk tribe on the middle Klamath.  Some spectacular views of the Klamath country make this video very easy on the eyes. The cover shot was taken near Coon Creek below Happy Camp on the middle Klamath River, as a former resident of the area, I admit I would have enjoyed more film from that section of the river!",1350864000,,816,4.537414965986395
