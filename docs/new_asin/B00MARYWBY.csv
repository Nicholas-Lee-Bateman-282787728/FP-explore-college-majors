6567261,1,B00MARYWBY,"Have been studying the murder of JFK since it took place when I was only 19 years old. Told my best friend the day it happened that my intuition was that LBJ had a part in the crime. This is the weakest treatment of the event I have ever seen. Nothing new and very poorly executed. The sound and picture quality are disgusting and sometimes nearly unintelligible, Don't waste a cent on this trash. My copy is for sale for a buck. you pay the shipping!",1423699200,2,451,4.255813953488372
6567262,5,B00MARYWBY,It is so sad that the Warren Commission would not accept the testimony of anyone who saw a shooter in the grassy knoll. First hand witnesses are the best and most reliable witnesses. It is so obvious  that the Warren Commission only wanted one conclusion and would not even listen to the large number of people who had clearly seen what actually happened.,1423008000,3,355,4.634920634920635
6567263,2,B00MARYWBY,The sound effects are driving me nuts!  They are really out of place and distracting. I could do without the bad music and cropped frame too.,1417737600,4,141,4.423076923076923
8671232,3,B00MARYWBY,Just more of the same. You can find any information you want on Youtube,1512259200,,71,4.142857142857143

8671234,5,B00MARYWBY,I've been studying the JFK assassination since 1973. I am a poor reader and I learn better by watching documentaries. I am glad to add it to my collection.,1489795200,,155,4.379310344827586
8671235,5,B00MARYWBY,GOOD PROGRAM,1483401600,,12,5.5
8671236,5,B00MARYWBY,Past and new technology make the dvd worth watching for more information on JFK assassination.,1473984000,,94,5.333333333333333
8671237,1,B00MARYWBY,"this doesn't deserve one star.  It could have been produced by a high school video class.
This was terrible and I blew $2 bucks on this.",1469923200,2,136,4.230769230769231
8671238,1,B00MARYWBY,"Little - if any - production value. Ridiculous and annoying sound effects. While the conspiracy theorists are probably drooling over this doc, I am not. I couldn't even make it to the end. Save your money.",1457913600,2,205,4.722222222222222
8671239,4,B00MARYWBY,v. gd. for its interviews of 3 main people inv.,1454025600,,47,3.8
8671240,4,B00MARYWBY,"This video is really for the experienced JFK conspiracy buff.  If this is your first foray into the subject, I'd suggest you look around and come back to this later.  This is a great video for what it is.  It does provide first person narratives and interviews from some of the key names involved, names that are tossed around in almost every related video about the subject.  I like it, just an other angle.",1453593600,,408,4.472972972972973
8671241,1,B00MARYWBY,"I can't finish this.  The video vs. audio assault on my senses is too much.  Why anyone would show a still photograph, then have a witness telling his story as a voiceover, then have a factoid graphic to read, (which is unrelated to the voiceover), ALL AT THE SAME TIME, is just mind blowing. Why?!  I'd like to listen to the person talking, without being forced to read something that pops up...that's about something else.  What chaos.  This film seemed like it had come out of a blender. Video and audio are of a very poor quality.  I could have got past that if whoever put this together had not been going through an obviously manic episode while assembling and editing....it's that chaotic.  And it makes me feel bad to criticize someone's (assuming) hard work.  The above is only *my* opinion.",1450828800,2,800,4.624113475177305
