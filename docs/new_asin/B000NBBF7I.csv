8176553,1,B000NBBF7I,"It watched the copy of this movie that has only Enlish subtitle. The dialogues are in Mandarin.

The whole movie drags from the beginning till the end. It's very boring. The plot is incoherent. There's nothing interesting here for me.

I gave away the DVD after watching it.",1213142400,,274,4.6875
8176554,5,B000NBBF7I,"This movie was well written, filmed and directed.  It is makes one think and question war and those who fight for what they believe in.  It is about a Mozi (yeah I had Wikipedia that) played by Andy Lau, who helps the underdog village battle a larger enemy.  It has twists which make him question life and his philosophy.",1209081600,,321,4.406779661016949
8176555,5,B000NBBF7I,"A Battle of Wits brings to the screen the story of a warrior/tactician known for his defensive skills who takes up the task of seeing to the protection of a city faced with superior enemy forces.
It's 370 BC and China finds itself in the Warring States Period a.k.a. the Era of Warring States (5th-3rd Centuries BC).  Seven major kingdoms and various smaller players are vying for control and power.  The city-state of Liang is about to be overrun by the overwhelming forces of the kingdom of Zhao, who in turn are on their way to wage war on the kingdom of Yan in China's Northeast.  The city's only hope lies in the arrival of a military contingent from the Mo-Tsu.  However, when only man arrives morale begins to falter.  The plot thickens, as things are not what they seem in 4th Century BC China...
The film combines fantasy, romance, drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind!
Moreover, the fascinating culture and traditions of China are presented very well in the film.
The plot is excellent and opens a window into the mysterious Orient.
Furthermore, shot on location it provides for some amazing scenery.
Needless to say, the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100%!  Their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.
The setting, the dialogues, the music, the battle sequences, and the costumes are all wonderful!
Very well written and very well presented, it is a movie definitely worth owning, let alone watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History, and especially for Eastern/Oriental enthusiasts.
Strongly recommended along with Seven Swords, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The House of Flying Daggers, The Promise, and Hero, to those with a soft spot for all things Chinese.",1187395200,3,1921,4.928792569659443

8176557,5,B000NBBF7I,"Well paced with a good story and direction, this film on war is in reality an anti-war film. The philosiphies and principles behind what makes one decide to fight, kill and make war is discussed by the main protaganists in the movie. Cleverly the answers to the above are not served to you on a platter. Rather, you are left to make up your own mind why you need to make war.

There are no bad guys and good guys. All depends on which side of the fence you are standing on. No matter where you lean, when the time is right and when there are no other options left, even the most serene pacifist can pick up a weopen and fight.

This is a beautiful movie on a delicate and difficult subject. The costumes and pacing is not overly done such as that in The Banquet or Curse of the Golden Flower. The story is uncannily modern and believable as we are living it in Iraq, Afghanistan, Chechnya, etc. It will make you think and question the insanity that drives man to war is actually very much sane.",1175385600,6,994,4.253968253968254
