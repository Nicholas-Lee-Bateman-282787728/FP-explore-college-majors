4467381,5,B004ULEF5G,"I enjoyed this movie very much. I did not like the first one so I waited along time before I even attempted to watch this one. It came on cable one Sunday and I sat down and watched it. I am sure it is probably not one of the best written movies ever made but personally I enjoyed the dancing. I enjoyed the theme of ""moving outside your comfort zone"" in order to achieve your dreams and I enjoyed the focus on real relationships instead of just having random sex with people. And finally the flexible British girl was amazing. I want to add this dance movie to my collection. I tend to like a little of everything. The good, the bad and the ugly. I try to always find something I like in movies I watch. This one was an unexpected pleasure for me.",1348531200,2,748,4.165517241379311

4467383,1,B004ULEF5G,I HATED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ABOUT DANCING NOT IN MY TIME BUT TODAY'S TIME IT WAS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE I HOPE WHO EVER MADE THIS MOVIE GIVE UP ON DIRECTING.,1331510400,3,181,4.2
4467384,1,B004ULEF5G,"It's the same old story.  Some dude living in midtown Detroit flipping crates on the night shift has the reasonable dream of helping Jay-Z make music videos.  Now just how does that usually work out?  I'm guessing less than stellar.  The intended twist that would make this movie stand out among other dance flicks is the incorporation of parkour (aka, free-running) into hip-hop.  Like some Brit who looks like a juiced up Elijah Wood is going to teach a bunch of slam dancers how to free-run in about two days--plausible?  The real way that this movie stands out is that it's the least impressive dance flick I've ever seen.  And folks, I love me some dance flicks.  Like, way love them--as in I have a secret dream of being in a dance crew ""love them"".  Yet this one just caused me pain.

 So I told you about the Detroit crew leader, on to the rest of ""the world"".  In Berlin there's a crew led by some unimposing white guy who looks like James McAvoy and Stuart Townsend (Lestat in Queen of the Damned) had a love child.  There's some gambling-addicted Brazilian guy with no personality whatsoever.  Then there's a bunch of other crews that all look like they hail from Detroit, too.  To make the story more ""real"" or whatever all three of these leaders repetitively let their crews down with all the guidance of a drunk lemming in need of directions to the way-serious dance competition where the winning team krumps away with $100K.

 The screenwriting was destitute at best.  Here's a big red flag: there are references to ""stepping up"" but none to ""getting served"".  Maybe the writers thought this was Step Up 4.  Oh, but there were plenty of other reasonable lines to make up for it like:
1)  ""We're the best, we can't lose!""
2)  ""I didn't graduate valedictorian like you.  Hip-hop's my only way there.""
3)  ""You know dancing is our only way out!""
4)  ""I hope you're ready to get your ass kicked again.""
5)  [and in response:] ""Man, I can't wait to kick his ass!""
 Yep.  That's how twenty-somethings talk.  But it's not just the quippy repartees, the writing consistently sucked throughout the script.

 I guess I should address the dancing.  So remember the cool moves from the solo scenes in Step Up and the cool group practice sessions in You Got Served--yeah, they all sucked in this movie.  Oh, and weren't the routines in the competitions in both of those movies like wicked, ""did that just happen"" awesome?  Yeah, not so much in this movie.

 But what about the dance competition at the end?  That's gotta' have some serious acts right?  Swing and a miss!  These scenes felt akin to watching 100 kids from Detroit and some exchange students from Rio and Berlin doing an urban Macarena in Hip Hop for Beginners--that's right next to Six Minute Abs at the DVD store.  The choreography appeared cardiovascularly unchallenging.  So much, in fact, that I've seen chubby teens more attentive to technical effort while sweating to Dance Dance Revolution!  And why oh why is Lil C (judge and choreographer on SYTYCD) in the cast!?!  I hope he's not responsible for this choreography.  He'd be out of a job unless the sequel machine farted out a successor to this miserable waste of film.

 Let's skip to the end.  The protagonist's crew wins against ""the world"".  However, I doubt they could even hold their own at a middle school talent show.  Scott Pilgrim faced a way tougher the World than this crew, and all he walked away with was some raggedy-haired chick and the same one-room apartment.  The lesson?  Don't know, don't care...and don't watch this movie.

The best part of this movie is the scathing review I get to write about it.  The attempts at drama were palpable--as in they left a taste in my mouth like a Hell-scorched Hot Pocket!  Now that I've seen the kind of dancing that wins world competitions I'm calling up Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill and Jay Baruchel--I think we've got a shot at the title!!!  I give this movie two pirouettes in the keester.  Just to clarify, that means an ""F"".  Instead you should watch the far technically superior You Got Served, any of the Step Up series.  But be warned, the plots and writing are almost unnoticeably better.

 Now how many Aspirin should I chase with vodka to forget that this movie ever happened?",1310083200,12,4266,4.63941018766756

4467393,1,B004ULEF5G,"The story line was terrible and predictable. Which I kind of expected coming into a movie like this. What caught me by surprise was how bad the dancing was. Most of the dance scenes were filmed with terrible close up shots, and the dancing wasn't even the focus. But when you could see more of the dancing, I understood why they did so many close up shots. The hip hop routines looked more like poorly choreographed high school cheerleading routines than professional dance crews. Everything seemed low budget. The movie looked like it was created in iMovie.

The interaction between characters was flat, and the romances were extremely lame and predictable. There was absolutely nothing redeemable about the movie. In fact, I had to write this review in order to feel like something valuable came from watching the movie. If you're looking for a light-hearted entertaining movie like I was, this is not it. But if you must, just go beat your head against the wall a few times and call it a night, at least you will have saved yourself a couple hours.",1379462400,2,1051,4.711956521739131

4467395,4,B004ULEF5G,Some of the action I still have difficulty identifying as dancing but never the less impressive. Not as good as the 1st but still a very good movie,1371513600,2,147,4.285714285714286

8441647,5,B004ULEF5G,"I watched this after watching the first ""You Got Served"". The movie was very different than the first in more ways than one, but it was equally as enjoyable and I would recommend it to people who want a good movie about dancing. I really enjoyed the way that they had the movie revolved around a final competition.",1496620800,2,314,4.431034482758621

8441651,1,B004ULEF5G,"I've now watched this movie twice (why ask why) and yet again came away with the realization that no, it wasn't just me being a dance movie snob, this one is mostly lame. I didn't remember half of what I saw the first time, very little was at all memorable. The acting and script, terrible. But it's a dance movie, that's to be expected right? Talk about the dancing! Well I would if the direction didn't totally let down even that bit of satisfaction. Close ups for no good reason. Guy is gliding and locking but you probably want a close up on his face. Hey those two guys appear to be doing something cool, but check out their hats! The group is moving in unison, let's get in close on one dancer's ear (the last may or may not have happened. All I know is how it felt)

That said, my mom finished viewing and announced that she wanted to buy it. Now, I have no intention of being around when she decides to show it but it goes to show Somebody enjoyed it. Hence, one whole star.",1463788800,,982,4.195767195767195
8441652,1,B004ULEF5G,"This movie is dreckatude! The plot and acting suck, but so do the dance moves. If the moves were good and you didtn't have to wade through the
lon drawn out attempts at a storyline with lame dialogue and character to get to them, I would give it 2 or 3 stars. Alas, it isn't worth finishing 2o minutes in. I tried because I like a good dance/success story movie, but this right herereally bad.",1449014400,,393,4.253333333333333
