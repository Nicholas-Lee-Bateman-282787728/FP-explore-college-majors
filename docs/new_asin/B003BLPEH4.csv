4106974,5,B003BLPEH4,"""Flipper"" was one of those many, many TV shows you had to choose from back in the 1960s when great shows were all over the dial.  I was a young kid back then and for some reason ""Flipper"" was a show I chose to pass on when channel surfing.  With TV in such a bad state today I've been turning to vintage television for entertainment.  I bought season one of ""Flipper"" and to my surprise I loved it!  And I've been talking about the series with others my age who also passed it up and I've been recruiting quite a few fans.

When I heard Season Two of ""Flipper"" was coming out I immediately ordered it.  I recently got my copy in the mail and I am happy to report the quality of the prints are just as pristine and beautiful as the first season on DVD, all in gorgeous color.  True, the cover artwork on the box, the discs themselves and the onscreen menu are lackluster.  But what's important is that Season Two has been released and a Season Three release would be the icing on the cake.

Burt Reynolds and other big stars are featured in season two. In fact, there are quite a number of two part episodes in the second season.

If you're tired of the junk out there on TV today do yourself a favor and get Season One or Two of ""Flipper.""  Brian Kelly's character of Porter Rick, raising two boys without their mother, makes for some very moving moments on the show.  There's a lot of love between the three of them or should I say four, when you include Flipper.  That's why I keep coming back for more.",1276128000,36,1505,4.22027972027972

4107005,5,B003BLPEH4,"I first saw Flipper re-runs as a child and loved the show. Recently forced inactivity one day had me watching a day of old movies on TCM and lo and behold the two Flipper movies were on - movies I never knew existed. Excellent performances by the dolphins who play Flipper and Luke Halpin as Sandy who is the only human actor common to the entire 1960's Flipper enterprise (movies and the 3 TV seasons). Both movies were great for kids and a friend had the newly released DVD set of Season 1 and 2 and I borrowed them for a trip down memory lane.

The quality of the filming was superb. NBC made sure they filmed in 35mm (movie quality) and the digital version is as sharp as you'll find from that era. I've since subscribed to Hulu and found the Flipper TV series there and frankly the quality is better than some TV shows on Hulu from the 90's! The quality of the underwater filming is as good as anything you see today. Yes - the directors did a bunch of splicing of Flipper shots and you do see similar dolphin scenes in repeated episodes but never in a way that detracts from the story line.

The chemistry for the Ricks family, the bonding with the dolphin by both boys, the innocence of the age (both of the era and the age of the boys) and the gorgeous scenery of the Florida Keys make this a compelling TV show. Its light and predictable and always a little implausible (a dolphin that can understand English - boys who can roam tropical lagoons at will) but somehow the package deal remains compelling especially in a world where violence, sexual content and the messy side of human nature is now front and center even in shows that children/teens can watch. Its awesome to watch a show where the nanny state doesn't intrude with excessive protectiveness of children where boys can be adventurous and free and where political correctness is nowhere to be seen (no hats or sunscreen or shirts to protect from the Florida sun). It reminds me of the carefree era of my childhood.

The plot lines in Season 2 are better and some episodes are genuinely gripping. Porter Ricks can delegate more to Sandy as he is older and more mature. Luke Halpin was 18 when this season was filmed and for a kid who by all reports lived and breathed ocean going sports, this role must have been heaven sent - he got to be paid to snorkel, scuba dive, race around in boats, spend most of his time in just a pair of cut off jeans and meet pretty older actresses! It is interesting to note though the gradual shift in emphasis to Bud (Tommy Norden) as the person closest to Flipper (who is essentially the central character). Halpin was the lead character in the two Flipper movies and his strong priority relationship with Flipper is evident in Season 1. The shift to story lines revolving around Bud began in Season 2 and accelerated in Season 3. By then Halpin was 19 and a part time Army Reservist and so had very much grown out of the Sandy Ricks role but was kept in the part because he looked younger than his age. I looked up on Google and IMDB and Halpin never really had any serious roles after Flipper so to some extent he was typecast by the Sandy Ricks role.

Great kid safe shows from a great era of American television that we will never see again. Highly recommended.",1394582400,,3269,4.4072847682119205

First I bought seasons 1, 2, 3 from fxcloudmedia. I payed $90.34. They sent met crap. Most DVD's didn't play in my standalone DVD player. The picture quality was horrible on the DVD's I could play. They recorded this from television (the Animal Planet logo was on screen all the time) and they must have used a VHS recorder for this. Also there was no artwork. Only some DVD-R's in a cheap box.

I've tried to contact fxcloudmedia about this, but they are not responding.

So don't buy any fxcloudmedia products! Buy the real thing, The Flipper Original Series Season 2 here on Amazon or elsewhere.",1310688000,4,719,4.782258064516129

Sounds like a great deal for consumers. My seven year old loved season one and has been asking me when season two will be available. I'm not sure what to tell her; I can't say I'm too excited about plunging into the world of manufacture on demand. Would it have really been that difficult for MGM to issue a reasonably priced standard season two? They certainly got season one right.

However, while looking at information on Wikipedia, I noticed that the second season includes many more episodes than I received.  Then when I checked with the Amazon listing for this item, I noticed that many episodes are listed that I did not receive.  Apparently I should have been sent disks 1 to 4, which I never received.

Rumor has it that the life span of these discs is shorter, for whatever it is worth. Amazon has this as an ""On Demand"" title, meaning that when you order it, the set it burned especially for you and not pulled off of a warehouse shelve somewhere. For titles that do not sell enough to manufacture in the usual process this is a good alternative to not seeing these titles available at all, and I clap my hands that it is available through Amazon.
I had to return this set once because an episode got ""stuck"", but the replacement set was OK. Amazon makes returns very easy, and you do not have to pay return shipping.

The audio and video quality of this set is outstanding, colors are nicely saturated, and the audio is crisp. Keep in mind no one was thinking about releasing the series on DVD's in the 60's, and the audio is purely mono.
The set consists of 8 discs in 2 Amaray style cases, each one holding 4 discs. The artwork is pretty generic, I'm sure most people could provide better, but it's the content on the discs that matters.

I really enjoyed watching Flipper, sure the series seems a little bit juvenile, but I prefer the word innocent.
It's also great to see shots of Florida from back in the 60's, now it just seems so commercial and built up.

Filmed in color 2 years before it became common place,Flipper is a wonderful burst of color during the early years of color filming tv series. Thank God NBC had the foresight not to film Flipper in black and white. That makes this series ultra special and you never know who might show up. Some great guest stars have been Barbara Feldon, Burt Reynolds, Lynda Day George, Jessica Walter and Martin E.Brooks to name a few. Ok MGM were ready for the third season. Tv shows like this will never come again no matter how hard they try and in those days they would crank out at least 25 to 30 episodes a season. They just don't make em like that anymore. A true classic to have in you dvd library.",1280188800,6,976,4.397790055248619

My only complaint is that should have put at least 8 episodes per disc instead of only 4(thats why theres so many dadblamed discs in the set).I loved this show as a kid and was very surprised how enjoyable it still is today. I guess i'm in the minority,but i love the old shows from the 50's and 60's because they are generally very wholesome. Looking foward to buying the rest of the flipper series when they finally release it.",1279324800,12,548,4.49
4107030,4,B003BLPEH4,"While as fans of this show, we can be happy the current owners are releasing these episodes, I just wanted to make you aware that contrary to what you read in another review, not all of these are pristine episodes made from original source material. Some of the source material appears to be 16mm prints that were distributed to TV stations for broadcast. There is often substantial print dirt, including gate hair (!!!), at the beginning and end of reels (usually 2 reels per episode). There is some negative dirt as well, but that is hardly noticeable.  Colors are mostly pure, bright and well-balanced, but blurry grain is evident in many episodes. You might not notice this on a small screen, but with today's larger screens, that lower quality is quite noticeable.

Overall, the images are good, considering the age of the material, but comparing the images to, for example the Hogan's Heroes or Star Trek Original Series DVDs that were made from original negatives, the difference is considerable. Occasionally there is some slight color shifting evident from scene to scene that may be the result of using multiple source prints to get best quality available.

There is a warning that these DVDs may not be playable on PCs, but I had no problem.

The Season arrives in two standard DVD cases with identical covers and backs, except for the episode lists which are practically unreadable. There are no extras or inserts. Here is an episode list for Season 2.

8393751,5,B003BLPEH4,"Another excellent quality release for this most lovely series!

I like season 2 of Flipper most of all for the appearance of the exquisite Swedish born Ulla Stromstedt (1939-1986) as the character Ulla Norstrand, featured in about 12 episodes.
She and Porter Ricks (Brian Kelly, 1931-2005) make the loveliest TV couple I have ever seen.
Amazing chemistry, very authentic.

The characters of Sandy (Luke Halpin) & Bud (Tommy Norden) Ricks are maturing and so are the stories.
The two-part story, 'The Ditching' is very dramatic and emotional.
Convincing performances from all involved.
Burt Reynolds also guest stars as a gun-wielding and boat-jacking killjoy criminal in another two-parter.
The Flipper The Detective episode features a fascinating dual role performance by Brian Kelly.
He used a prosthetic nose to further the character but it wasn't necessary, he had exemplary versatility.

This release, like the other two from Olive Films is minimalist with no extras or printed episode list.
A missed opportunity to further the message of this wonderful series.

Another Beautiful Purchase, one of The Best!

8393753,4,B003BLPEH4,"This review is for the new August 2017 Olive Films Flipper: Season 2 [DVD] 4-disc release not yet available here at Amazon at the time of this writing. First of all, its great to finally have these episodes on single discs and not the old  ""flipper discs. I swore I would never pay the $40 to nearly $60 bucks for the OOP MGM version from 2010 which is what most of the reviews here are based on. Please note these are from the same source material used in that 2010 release and are more than acceptable picture and sound quality. I chose the DVD version over the Blu-Ray edition because I felt the BD format would bring out any defects that exist from these old transfers. At this moment I am viewing Episode 15 Flipper The Detective and it really does look good. I have spot checked each of the 30 episodes and all look equally acceptable. For $19 bucks I am pleased!",1503964800,2,869,4.331288343558282
