2117342,3,B0002S64VE,"Went in with high hopes...It had creepy moments, especially the old woman and the young girl.  The lead character in the wheelchair was miscast in my opinion.  Too much, too little?  A surreal ""family"" gathering near the end is well shot and captured, but doesn't save the overall ""not scary"" feeling I left with.  Decent effort, didn't blow my skirt up... ;-)",1116374400,2,360,4.758064516129032
2117343,4,B0002S64VE,"I rented this movie, and I was pretty pleased. Don't let it fool you or get your hopes all high when people call it ""The Japanese Chainsaw"" film. Don't get this thinking someone is going to die left and right with a chainsaw. The background of the family has this weird Texas Chainsaw Masscre family feel, that's what that means.

The granddaughter that comes to stay creeps me out just for the fact that she is paper thin. I don't want to spoil it, but it was a really good movie, until it got the very end. Leave it to the Japanese to always leave you with the WTF look at the end of the movie. I don't like the ending too much. The torture scenes are awesome, and I still joke around when the main character is calling ""Ken! Ken!"" Just the way he says it in Japanese is HILARIOUS. The Chainsaw feel is definitely at the end of the movie and the torture are pretty decent.",1115596800,,874,4.2023809523809526
2117344,3,B0002S64VE,"I normally don't dabble to much in the foreign subtitled horror movies, but when the cover of this one said it was the foreign version of the Texas chainsaw massacre, I just had to rent it. Anyway, I was generous with my stars because of the gore. This movie is probably closer to a 2 star movie. I gave it a 3rd star because I really wish horror movies made in America had stuff like this in them still. You know, the good old fashion ""dead alive"" splatter affects. However, this movie wasn't that overdone with blood, but it had its morbid moments. It was a half way decent, bloody movie, with a very interesting plot that will draw you into it and keep your attention. However it had its problems: (1) the subtitles - not that I can totally hold the movie at fault for this, but a lot of movies released across seas at least have dub over. I would rather hear a bad dub over than read a movie. If the old cheesy Godzilla series could afford dub over, than why not B-horror? (2) the actors at times are corny, maybe this is just a cultural thing, but its definitely not your typical Hollywood actors here,  at times it is very laughable how the characters react to situations. (3) some cheesy FX - a lot of fake blood, and at times some really bad props: like plastic bugs made to look like live bugs (4) the movie seemed to be a little slow in spots, the only interesting aspects where with the old woman and the handicap boy. I certainly didn't care for the boring cop story they were trying to fit into this. (5) Its way too far fetched - I know it's a horror movie and all, but come on! This handicap boy is the repeated ""helpless"" victim in this movie. He has arms doesn't he????????!!!!!!!!!!!!! Half the time he just LETS the things happens to him without ever fighting back!  I mean, how helpless is this kid? If someone put their fingers in my mouth I would bite them off. If an old lady approached me with the intentions of torturing me and I had movement of my arms, then I would punch her and knock her false teeth down her throat. I mean, this got a little old, this kid is a wimp! (6) Finally, It wasn't even close to the Texas chainsaw massacre. I would more compare it to  ""Misery"" . Final verdict: some good blood, not a very serious horror movie (at least not to me)  maybe worth a rental If your bored over a weekend. They definitely need to make an American version of this.",1114560000,2,2396,4.259340659340659
2117345,2,B0002S64VE,"I am a huge fan of Japanese horror.  I try to get my hands on as many of these films as possible.  One of the things I especially like about J-Horror are the originality of the ideas and the emphasis on truly scaring the viewer by taking the horror seriously instead of reverting to self-referentiality and comedy.  ""Living Hell"" seemed to promise a different type of J-Horror; instead of subtlety and spookiness (with little blood) this one was advertised as a gory bloodbath, ""the Japanese TCM"" in other words.  It also compared it to other modern horror chef d'oeuvres as ""Evil Dead"" and ""Cabin Fever"".  Huh?  Have I watched the same film?  Frankly, ""Living Hell"" does not in any way approach the level of ferocious originality those films had and I fail to see the similarities.

2 brothers and their sister, all in their twenties, share the same house that is owned by their father, often away on business trips.  One day they receive word that two distant relatives (a 70-year old grandmother and 22-year old granddaughter) whose family were murdered will be moving in with them.  As they move in, we see right away that the two are mighty strange; the grandmother is senile and barely says anything, same with the granddaughter who is completely mute.  Not only do they never talk but they are curiously devoid of any expression.  Wheelchair-bound Yasu will soon discover there is something mighty wrong with these two and soon falls under the guise of their torture techniques.

 The film started off okay, as we were presented to some very intriguing characters.  You wouldn't think a 70-year old grandmother and her frail 22-year old granddaughter would look scary...but they are!  The way they just stood there looking like ice statues totally devoid of expression, except for a trace of madness in their eyes definitely creeped me out.  You just know something seriously bad is bound to happen.  They are about as unlikely a pair of killers as you're going to get and that's part of the problem; I never believed for one bit that these two could be so dangerous.  For one, none of their victims even try to defend themselves and these are two frail and physically weak women!  The worst is Yasu, who is one of the wimpiest guys I've ever seen in a horror movie.  I kept wanting to scream at my TV ""Get a backbone for pete's sake!"".  I realize the poor guy is in a wheelchair but how about using your upper-body to ward them off...But no, he just spends the whole movie whining and wimpering while they torture him.

I don't speak Japanese so it's hard for me to truly gauge quality of acting but that didn't stop me from noticing how poor it all was, just by the intonations of voice, wooden expressions and awkward movements.  To people fluent in Japanese, it must come across as a real turkey.  As for the gore, yes this movie is gory but not in a splatter sense, most of the gore is related to torture and I must admit that several of these scenes were especially creative (Root canal, cockroach, etc.).  Too bad the creative ideas of gore were not supplemented with creative storytelling.  To top it off, the film takes a further nosedive due to a completely nonsensical ending.  It tries to be clever and tie up the illogical aspects of the story but instead drives it ever deeper into its grave.  If you love Japanese horror as much as I do, you might still want to give this a try as it is mildly entertaining at times and due to the gore.  As for me, I would gladly take those 90 minutes back.",1100217600,10,3513,4.5744
2117346,5,B0002S64VE,"what a breath of fresh air!! this is a supreme example of useing ""TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"" as a blue print to make a horror flick the right way! & then some!!! anyone who knocks this film doesn't truly enjoy a good spooky horror flick or they started to watch it then got confused in the first half of the movie & turned it off,wich is absolutely a stupid thing to do in the first place but its extra stupid when all the confusion unfolds as bloody beautiful as it does in the last half of this WHICKED PISSSSAH horror flick!!!!! LIVING HELL is a true horror MASTERPIECE! its flat out CRAZY NUTTZ! PURE ENTERTAINMENT  to the bone! i just can't say enough about this loooooney flick!!! I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!! one of the review titles on this page says its ""THE THINKING MANS TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"" i couldn't agree more!!! thats the best way to describe it!!! THIS HORROR MOVIE IS TRULY ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. 5 STARS,2 THUMBS UP,& 1 THANK YOU!! TO SHUGO FUJII FOR MAKING A GREAT NEW SCARY FLICK FOR US HORROR FANZ & TRULY RESPECTING THE HORROR GENRE!!!! later on fellow horror fans!!!!!!",1097280000,2,1119,4.405797101449275
2117347,3,B0002S64VE,"I enjoyed Living Hell, but maybe not for the right reasons.  There is some creepy camera work and editing, but real scares are compromised by a convoluted story and some not so intentional humor.  Perhaps I was expecting too much after hearing comparisons to TCM.  It turns out that there were a couple of shots directly lifted from Tobe Hooper's masterpiece and that, to me, is where the similarities end.

Living hell proffers the same kind of entertainment as many of the better Honk Kong Category 3 films (minus the true crime).  I did enjoy this movie; I just didn't think it was anything all that special, particularly when considering the richness of the quasi-genre, Japanese Horror, to which it belongs.  However, it's definitely worth the rental if you are a low-budget horror fan like me.",1095206400,,799,4.838235294117647
2117348,5,B0002S64VE,"When i picked this movie up all i expected from it was a japanese slasher flick called ""living hell"" what I got, was much MUCH more, this movie at times does seem VERY simialar to ""texas chainsaw massacre"", and, with its fiendishly clever plot twists and ingenious ending, it at times seems simialar to ""american psycho"" but in the end, you will find this a unique blend of mystery, horror, and [if your mind is twisted enough] comedy. in short, any movie where a 90 year old woman eats a cockroach, well that just spells good watchin.",1095033600,5,535,4.525773195876289
8031271,2,B0002S64VE,Subtitled in English. The movie starts off really slow and with it being in Japanese it just makes the movie slower. If you don't like Subtitled movies this is not for you.,1315526400,,172,4.40625
8031272,3,B0002S64VE,"It has everything in terms of atmosphere and the way torture is shown. They wanted to create a masterpiece, but it just does not come across convincingly. The ending is a bit of a clich -- too clever -- and it basically does itself in. However much I would want to love this film, it doesn't make the cut.",1259712000,,305,4.186440677966102

8031274,2,B0002S64VE,"When most people think of Japanese horror films, they tend to think of supernatural tales such as ""Ring"" and ""Ju-on"" rather than slasher fare.  ""Living Hell"" may be an illustration of why.  I received this movie as a Christmas gift after reading several (inexplicably) favorable reviews of it on various horror websites.  The premise of the film, that a young man in a wheelchair is a prisoner in his own home and is subject to the cruel tortures of a mysterious old woman and her eerie young caregiver, is quite intriguing on paper.

Indeed, for an all-too-brief while the film looks as if it may live up to the hype as the opening moments transition smoothly from grisly gorehound fare to a somewhat more brooding atmosphere.  That being said, this film is nothing if not unsubtle.  The foreboding mood lasts only a few minutes before being cast aside.  The potential for psychological terror is there, but seems to be ignored in favor of one (supposedly) shocking scene after the next.  This all reaches a crescendo in the final 20 minutes or so of the film, with a couple of ""twists"" so obvious that I actually thought the film was building up for a ""swerve"" that would suddenly take it in another direction and leave me wowed.  Alas, the obvious plot twists take place exactly as expected with nothing but a couple of gross-out scenes at the end to keep even a modicum of your attention.

For all I've said, ""Living Hell"" comes dangerously close to being a watchable movie (hence 2 stars instead of 1), but the howler of an ending will leave most viewers in the cold.",1169251200,,1572,4.622302158273381
8031275,1,B0002S64VE,"It should be a crime to compare this with Tobe Hooper's classic Chainsaw Massacre.  This is a terrible movie and a complete waste of your life.

If you want to see a strange and violemt Japanese horror film, pick up All Night Long instead.  It is miles above this garbage.",1160352000,3,272,4.4
8031276,2,B0002S64VE,Either the people that praise the gore in this flick don't know what real gore is or I rented a cut version of this flick. I gave it two stars for originality and for atmosphere (Very spooky.) I was very dissatisfied with the make-shift ending and terribly dissapointed with the effects.

8031277,2,B0002S64VE,"This movie is not so bad you'd turn it off,but it was

so typical of most(75%)horror films today. After seeing JU-ON

(by far the best horror film made between 2000-2006)I really

had my hopes up,which I admit it's not fare to compare this

with that masterpiece(dare I say that,well in 10yrs JU-ON

will be considered that, it's that great!)but I was let down.

I'm not going to go thru a lot of writing,just look at James

& Morado reviews there really good and to the point. Why 2 stars

the old womans daughter was the only thing,and I do mean the

only thing good about this picture,she was freaky looking

but o.k. we need more,like music,the soundtrack was as if

the director bought a keyboard from K-MART.Music is so

important to a horror film just watch CARRIE(76)HALLOWEEN,

CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST,JAWS,DEEP RED,THE BEYOND,THE SHINING(80)

and of course the best for last THE OMEN(76)and it's very

obvious that the reviewers who scored this picture so high

probably have not seen any of these. NOTE:Amazon buyers it

is not to late to get these horror masterpieces typed above

they have them all(YES!CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST TOO.I KNEW MY

AMAZON WOULD NOT LET ME DOWN,YOU ARE REALLY THE BEST!)so buy

the movies above and stay away from this.",1138147200,6,1248,4.8246445497630335
8031278,5,B0002S64VE,"With so many pseudo-horror films on the market these days it's easy to grow dissillusioned with the whole genre. Even the recently released ""Hostel"", which is the closest thing we have at the moment, does not consistently deliever. ""Living Hell"", however, is the first REAL horror film I've seen in a long time. It is certaintly worthy of being compared to its brother ""Texas Chainsaw Mass."" as both are unrelenting in their terror. Though this film does suffer from being corny at times, it more then makes up for it. I totally recommend this for any fan! I could go on and on about this wonderful film but you will have to see it for yourself!",1137628800,,645,4.568965517241379
8031279,1,B0002S64VE,"I don't know if this film is an independent film or film that actually had a decent budget to work with, but it sure look like one of those really bad independent film.  I rented this movie, because it looked like a very scary movie on the front cover of the rental box.  But, I tell you, I was bored to death watching this film.  This film has some of the worst acting that I have ever seen.  The film is not scary and the gross parts were very amaturish done, any college or high school students could do that. I will not consider this film even stupidly funny, it's that bad.  Skip this trash!  It does not even come close to the regually American version of the Texas Chain Saw Massacre.  Negative 10 stars!",1134864000,3,711,4.222222222222222
8031280,5,B0002S64VE,"This film absolutely rocks.  It has everything you could want, freaks, torture, an evil homage to ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"", insanity, eyeball sucking, gore, etc.  It's like a train wreck, you don't want to look but it's way too fascinating.  The main character keeps getting tortured & your mind keeps jumping ahead, what will happen next?  How much can he endure?  Why is this happening?!  I don't want to reveal too much of the plot here, it's just so great I gave it a standing ovation at the end.
One of the most original films to come out in years.  You can't call yourself a die-hard horror fan if you miss this gem.",1117411200,,630,4.473684210526316
