8346503,4,B001VJ9KO6,"In this 47 minutes video, Ron Phillips, the Master Gunsmith at Wilson Combat, shows, step-by-step, how to completely disassemble, lubricate and re-assemble a Colt 1911 pistol.
Pros: among several instructional videos on how to disassemble the 1911 I own, this is the only one that include lubrication.
Cons: home made DVD  the label is peeling off.",1456099200,,348,5.214285714285714
8346504,2,B001VJ9KO6,"I recently ordered and received the DVD mentioned here. I paid over $35.00 plus another $3.99 for Shipping and Handling. When I received the DVD, on its cover jacket I saw that it was originally developed and marketed by a company whose web site is listed as ""GunVideo. Com"". I went to this site and discovered that this same video was for sale at the price of $19.99. That's a considerable difference vs. what I paid through Amazon. I consider this to be way out of line. My mistake was that I did not first try Google to see if I could locate this same product elsewhere so I take some responsibility for this mishap. However, non the less, the price difference is unacceptable and I consider it to be gouging.

Now, with regard to the content of the video, Wilson Combat is legendary in the firearms field for producing some of the finest 1911style handguns in the world. Their reputation speaks for itself. That said, Mr. Ron Phillips, the Master Gunsmith who is depicted in the video as completely disassembling and then reassembling at typical 1911 handgun, did do an good job in showing the novice how to completely strip then reassemble this style of firearm. However, I take issue with what I consider to be Mr. Phillip's excessive use of lubricant during the reassembly phase. While lubricating the firearm is a must to ensure proper functioning, in my personal opinion, I believe that in some areas, Mr. Phillips applied far more lubricant than is necessary. In fact, in the video the surface of the firearm that Mr. Phillips was working on looked overly oily. I'm concerned that with this amount of lubricant the shooter may experience difficulty with handling the firearm as well as possibly encountering issues with carbon and other residue build up. While I am certainly not a gunsmith, I am a retired Mechanical Engineer who has spent his entire career in maintaining and repairing very costly equipment as found in the petrochemical industry. As such, I consider myself more than qualified to offer my thoughts on the level of lubrication needed to properly maintain a piece of equipment.

While Mr. Phillips did a good job in clearly showing and explaining each step of the disassembly and reassembly phase of the firearm, follow up review of YouTube has brought to light the fact that there are many...many home made videos that do an equally proper job in detailing the step by step processes involved with this subject matter. Also, in at least one case, I felt that the gentleman in the YouTube video did an even better job in providing detailed information than that which was present in the Wilson Combat video by Mr. Phillips. Also, in the videos I reviewed on YouTube, each one went to great lengths to stress the need to not over lubricate the firearm and clearly showed in the video a significantly less application of lubrication than shown in the Wilson Combat video.

So, in conclusion, Mr. Phillips is undoubtedly an outstanding pistol smith and Wilson Combat is an outstanding manufacturer of top of the line 1911 firearms. The information included in the video was good but, as pointed out above, I take personal exception with one aspect of what was portrayed. Lastly, you can save yourself the cost of purchasing this video simply by going onto YouTube and searching for the subject matter. If you do decide to use YouTube, please review at least a couple of the videos since each provides its own particular nuances on how to perform the disassembly and reassembly. Then pick the one you like best and stick with it.",1400457600,2,3553,4.773983739837399
8346505,4,B001VJ9KO6,"""Colt 1911 Auto: Complete Disassemble & Reassembly"" is a very straight forward walk-through for the correct way to breakdown, maintain, and assemble a 1911A1 Auto. We own a small gun store and are learning to perform basic gunsmithing on-site, and this video is a great starting point.

Pros -
+ Very complete instruction by Ron Phillips (of Wilson's Gun Shop), who clearly knows his way around a 1911A1
+ Helpful tips on maintaining the 1911A1

Cons -
- No DVD chapters, it just plays straight through for roughly 45-minutes, so finding a particular area of interest requires ""Fast Forwarding"" to the appropriate section

This is a very informative DVD that delivers what it promises and is worth the investment if you have a Colt 1911.

Recommended!
