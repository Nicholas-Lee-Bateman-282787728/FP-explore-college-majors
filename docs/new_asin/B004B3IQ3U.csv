It was just people getting interviewed talking about their Italian parents and how they made sacrifices for their children.  Once you see it once, you will not want to watch it again.  Honestly, it was sorta boring.  My mom & I were disappointed.",1514332800,,351,4.476190476190476

8421384,5,B004B3IQ3U,"This is a wonderful documentary about what it means to be an Italian/American.  My grandparents spoke very little English (in fact no one's grandparents I knew spoke English and most parents spoke broken English).  This documentary shows the values, work ethic and determination that were instilled in us growing up and makes you remember the music and laughter that went on at family dinners, weddings (dancing the tarantella) and the arguments too, all while eating Nona's or Mama's homemade pasta, listening to Caruso 78 records or Uncle Franco playing the concertina.  Buy it - you won't be disappointed!!!",1311033600,5,610,5.204081632653061
