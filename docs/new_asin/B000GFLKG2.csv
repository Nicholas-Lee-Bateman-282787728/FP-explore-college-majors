Over all Summary/ Plot
In the small little plot of land over looking a large body of water in a tall, but very cramped apartment building that has stairs and  an elevator lives the Numata's. Mr. Numata is a business man who is hardly at home during the day and comes home late at night. Whenever he is at home he is most likely drunk or getting over his hangover and is thus in no mood to interact with his family. His Wife Mrs. Numata, a stay a home wife whose hobby's include listening to Western Music and making coasters in the shape of miniature Vynl Records. They have two sons. Shinichi, a High School student who seems to please his father with his high academics at first, then he tries his luck at dating one of his more popular class mates who lives in what looks like a department store suites. There is the main character Shigeyuki, a 9th grader whose only goal in life is to sleep, fight, and day dream about roller coasters but is constantly stressed out about his nagging parents and being bullied in school. Shigeyuki's grades are nothing like his older brothers and his father, fed up with is lack of conviction and his terrible grades so close to entrance exams times. Has his wife seek out a new tutor for her youngest son.  She hires a Mr. Yoshimoto, a college student not even supported by the National Education Department to teach her son after revealing that he is not the first tutor that their son has had before. Determined to get paid handsomely by Mr. Numata,  Mr. Yoshimoto is a tutor who does whatever he feels necessary as an unconventional tutor that many parents would balk at to get the job done and Shigeyuki to start taking academics more seriously.
Watch as this film shows the criticizing moments about Japanese Culture containing lack of community interaction and Examination Ranking System within Japanese Educational Systems.",1509321600,,2056,4.5967302452316074
8131354,5,B000GFLKG2,"In general, I love Japanese films and I lived in Japan for 8 years. I showed this to my college students in Osaka and they weren't sure what to make of such bald satire, but the ending is so stunning (funny? bizarre? angry?) that you have to react somehow. And that's the point: family life, education, social adjustment -- it's all been studied and dissected in Japanese sociological studies to the point where everyone knows about Examination Hell and Education Mamas and Juku cram schools and blah blah blah. Even in the 80's, all of that was brewing and Morita throws the whole pie in your face -- literally.

Watch it to get a sense of Japan's often monotonous grind in urban life, to get a sense of how families become disengaged from real meaning, to understand why the education establishment rebelled in the 90's and just to have a good laugh at modern life and why we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously.

Morita does amazing things with camera angles that are social commentary all by themselves and he also uses a really interesting technique of magnifying insignificant sounds and minimizing significant ones -- also a kind of commentary on finding (or losing) meaning.

Totemo omoshiroi! watch it.",1333929600,2,1214,4.826923076923077
8131355,5,B000GFLKG2,"This is one of the best Japanese movies since Kurosawa's High and Low--and that's a long time.  The beauty of this film is the point of view, signaled at the very beginning and then seemingly erased throughout, but it's there.  This is probably one of the funniest, saddest films I've ever seen about the individual, familial, and social sides of modern Japanese culture--and, of course, by extension, because Japanese culture is ultimately grounded in every modern human culture on this planet, yours.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed, unless you're not alive.  I would say a very accurate American corollary to this film--though the two have almost nothing else in common other than that they mirror each other as tragic-comic commentaries on the culture from which they issue--is Scorsese's After Hours.  If you like the one, you'll like the other; and if you don't, then I'm truly sorry for you.",1294876800,,907,4.9801324503311255
8131356,2,B000GFLKG2,This movie was weird and depressing.  Not entertaining at all.  Would not have wasted my money buying this movie.,1257379200,,113,4.894736842105263
8131357,5,B000GFLKG2,"I first saw this film almost ten years ago in a Japanese culture class I had to take in college to fulfill my Nonwestern Culture requirement for graduation.  It really stuck with me for the past 10 years and I kept scouring the net trying to find a copy of it.  Thankfully, it is now out on DVD.  The film gives a seemingly accurate insight into Japanese family life.  The characters are all very, very real, as are the situations - having to do well in school, coming of age, and the relationships between the characters are fascinating.  If you're looking for a soap opera-type movie about family life in the Far East, this one definitely isn't the one for you.  It is not a comedy, although there is enough of a comedic element that what little levity it does have is sufficient.  The role of the tutor guy is pretty interesting....yeah, he succeeded in helping Numata get his grades up, but did he bring the family closer together?  That is conjectural; it could go one way or another depending on the viewer's perception.  I will admit, I have not seen any other films about Japanese family life, but this one is definitely one I'd recommend to anyone.",1211673600,3,1157,4.524038461538462
8131358,1,B000GFLKG2,"I first became interested in this movie because of Juzo Itami's name in the credits - I've loved almost everything I've seen from Itami, including the Funeral, A Taxing Woman, and of course, Tampopo.  The Family Game however, is one I should have stayed far, far away from.

Calling The Family Game a ""comedy"" is a stretch - there's nothing funny in this movie, and the entire script seems to plod from one pointless scene to another, with very little cohesive material binding each sequence.

There is zero character development - and I know some people will cry foul at this, but honestly - the younger brother's grades go up, the older brother's grades go down - and you have zero insight into why either happened.  Yes, the ""I want to piss off my bully"" comes into play, and then there's the whole ""I can hit better than you"" ""fight scenes,"" but even those feel tacked on.

All in all, I would say skip this one... there are so many other great Japanese family/life/culture movies to spend your money on.",1209945600,2,1008,4.5777777777777775
8131359,5,B000GFLKG2,"I really enjoyed the film ""The Family Game"" when I first viewed it many years ago, and time has not lessened this films appeal to me. The films release date was in 1984. The reviewer below, [Michael W.] has written an excellent review of the film, and I would recommend that other reviewers read it. The film stars the late actor Yusaku Matsuda, as the tutor Yoshimoto. [Yusaku Matsuda died of cancer in 1989]. In this film his portrayal of the tutor is a very unorthodox one I might add. However, with the price that the father is paying him if he succeeds, only adds to his incentive to motivate his young pupil. And succeed he does. On a side note, Yusaku Matsuda was also the father of actor Ryuhei Matsuda [""9 Souls"" and ""Love Ghost""]. The film centers on the entire family, but more importantly the youngest son Shigeyuki (Ichirota Miyagawa).

Shigeyuki is a disappointment to the family, due to the fact that he does not get good grades in school; whereas the elder brother Shinichi (Junichi Tsujita) is an excellent student who has been accepted into a top high school. This concerns the family, who believe that the younger son will not be accepted into a top-notch high school. Their solution? Get the younger son a tutor. The tutor, Yoshimoto (Yusaku Matsuda) not only turns around Shigeyuki, by demanding he spend more hours in his studies [even if this means slapping him around] but Yoshimoto also teaches Shigeyuki  self-defense, when the latter informs him of bullies. And with Yoshimoto as his tutor, not only does Shigeyuki's grades improve, but so does his self esteem when he is no longer picked on by the other students.

The father is portrayed by the late, great director/actor Juzo Itami. [He is sorely missed]. This is a great dark comedy that gives the viewer a look at Japanese home life. Many of my friends who have viewed this film say that this film shows a dysfunctional Japanese family, and I would have to disagree. I think it is a funny look into a family's life where the father tends to be away too much, while the mother (Saori Yuki) pampers the younger son too much. Also, I believe director Yoshimitsu Morita did an excellent job with this film with many of the slapstick humor the film delivers. There are many memorable scenes in the film, [espcially the eating rituals of the family] and I recommend the film highly. And as the reviewer below has written, the ending of the film is quite unique. Highly recommended!",1176940800,10,2457,4.669745958429561
