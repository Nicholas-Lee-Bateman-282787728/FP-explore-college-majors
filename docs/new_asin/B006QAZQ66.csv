5013291,5,B006QAZQ66,"I have been gardening for a few years now, and I am willing to try anything that makes sense to achieve the results I am looking for.  I have done some really great things for my garden over the years, but I have to tell you;  I wish I had seen this video 5 years ago!

Paul is a truly amazing individual, both in his gardening skills and knowledge, but perhaps even more importantly as an individual.  Even if you have never even thought of gardening before today, he will inspire you to take that leap!  He will also inspire you to seek the truth that surrounds us all everyday, and everywhere.

Paul's main idea in this video seems to be the one sustainable thing that I have been missing in my garden, and I can't wait to implement it!  This video for me has changed everything!",1326672000,38,782,4.27891156462585

I've felt in my gut that we were destroying the natural world with all the fertilizers and chemicals we are using.  I've seen reports of the cancer causing agents in pesticides and herbicides.  Then, enter Paul and his simple methods of gardening.  And he connects all of it back to the Bible.  Nothing could be more perfect in my opinion.

5013325,3,B006QAZQ66,"I liked the dvd, but I am not sure I saw the whole thing, it was shown at a victory garden club start up meeting and I think it was edited down for the time of the meeting. I have to say it isn't ""new""...I have been reading and attending different classes and seminars on permaculture for a while, which is what this is promoting, just not to the depths. With the Black Forest burn in CO, many inhabitants of the forest are trying to rebuild after their loss, one thing in abundance right now is wood chips, due to fire mitigation. Many in the surrounding areas have done this sort of gardening with a high rate of success, when other attempts at a regular garden weren't highly productive or successful. We have had drought yrs, and so everyone is concerned about water and trying to get a yield w/o having to water and water, and water. Many of us want to know what is going into our food, want to grow REAL food, not genetically altered food, and we want to do that as close to nature as possible, but with a method that doesn't make us slaves to our garden, chemicals, and additives.",1423958400,,1087,4.307317073170732

5013329,3,B006QAZQ66,"I've been doing this for about 15 years around my fruit trees.  Only a guy on the internet by the name of Yellman who frequented the Fruit Orchard forum on the excelent Garden Net web site told me to do it instead of God.

The documentary drags on a little.  Its sometimes self-contradictory for example, at around the 20 minute mark, Gautschi says no nitrogen is necessary for his method.  At a little past the 30 minute mark he makes clear that you need a source of nitrogen to accelerate the decomposition.

But yeah, I can attest (or is it ""testify brother hallelujah!"") that the method works.  The chips are excellent mulch, i.e. water conservation device and weed suppressant without more, but if you want to build soil fast, you had better plan on having a steady source of nitrogen in there.  The stuff won't just rot to meet your timetable.

It's quite evident that the man is driven, and of course any method he chose would work given that the ""gardener's footsteps are the best fertilizer""

Overall, he drives home the point that we can use a lot more organic stuff on our gardens than a few bags of stuff we get at the garden store.  A yard or two can be consumed in a typical backyard garden.  I can think of scenarios where this would not be a good method.  But for 90% of us, yeah, it's a good practice.",1419724800,,1318,4.400826446280992
5013330,5,B006QAZQ66,"This DVD is awesome. It is literally the most insightful information I have found on gardening. I have finally succeeded at growing all my vegetables, thank you Paul.",1418860800,,166,4.964285714285714
5013331,2,B006QAZQ66,"Paul Gautschi has a beautiful garden (though I am unsure whether one should prune his apple trees the way he does) and much of what he says is the truth.  I am convinced, nevertheless, that he is a deceived individual who does not have a genuine relationship with God and, therefore, should not be listened to with respect to theological matters.  ""Even the devil can quote Scripture,"" not to mention that the information he shares about organic gardening, mulching, etc., is not new revelation, but the recycling/repackaging of tips and techniques already discovered and respected by the secular world at large.

Within the first thirty minutes I was pretty sure Gautschi was deceived because he speaks, sounds (and even looks!) EXACTLY like a man in our community named Greg who thinks he lives in constant communication with God but is, instead, grossly deceived (and psychologically damaged).  I have spent many hours over the past ten years engaged in theological discussions with Greg, and those discussions never fail to give me a headache (literally.)  Much of what he says at first sounds truthful and like a legitimate interpretation of scripture, but it falls apart upon close examination.  One example:  God has told him that He (God) is the only ruler of men such that He must be King of society (okay) but that translates into this man believing that God loves monarchy and hates democracy.  My response:  If God is the king within each person there still needs to be a mechanism for leadership within a society composed of God-ruled individuals -- so wouldn't that mean an egalitarian system like democracy?

""No, no, no,"" Greg responds, ""the only political system of which God approves is monarchy.""  This is insane, of course, because what is the end result as applied in the real world ?  That A MAN (a mortal, fallible, human being) becomes the ruler of other men, the very proposition that has fueled pagan civilizations for millenia (Egypt, Mesopotamia, medieval England) and which Greg himself acknowledges is not what God desires!  But even when you point this out Greg cannot back down, change his tune OR see the flaw in his ""revelation"":  further argument does nothing but flow around in infinite circles.

Getting back to Paul Gautschi:  I felt very sorry for him as he gave us a glimpse into his childhood. Although he may well be exaggerating, he states that as early as age five he remembers his father waking him up on a Saturday morning to go haul horse manure for the family garden, and that he and his siblings ""wore out shovels"" spading that manure into the ground.  Working a five year old that hard is child abuse, amen;  one of the foolproof methods for perverting the human race is childhood abuse/emotional deprivation.  (Another foolproof method is drug use).

[Oops:  I started this review during a short window of opportunity but do not have enough time to finish it.  I will have to save it for now and complete it later.  My bad!]

[12/21/15]  Continuing:  I have studied the issue of spiritual deception for 20 years and have noticed that there are recurrent patterns in the mode, method and context which distinguish spiritual deception from divine revelation.  (This is why the similarity between Paul Gautschi and the man Greg I mentioned is not unimportant but, instead, extremely relevant.)  One of the most prevalent is the idea that the INDIVIDUAL controls the relationship between himself and God.

I was raised understanding that although God was there to listen to my prayers and to form my character into that of Christ's (if my desire was sincere), He was Lord and Master of the Universe and certainly had no obligation to RESPOND to anyone! As a young person I experienced His response only as the insight that since I was becoming more mature and Christlike in character, my prayers were being answered (which implied divine activity).  But I would have considered it blasphemous for anyone to expect a direct response from God (I was unaware until much later in life that there were people who claimed to hear directly from God) so I certainly never expected God to communicate to me directly.  I mean, who am I in the great scheme of things, when God has the entire Universe to oversee?

I did eventually experience direct revelation from God, surprisingly -- beginning in my mid-30's after a lifetime of walking humbly in a path of His creation -- but God is always the one who initiates communication and it is always about what HE wants to communicate, not what I might think to ask (if I thought it appropriate to ask, which I do not).  And He does not communicate orally, as a voice:  it is my personal belief that God does not communicate in the form of a voice precisely to distinguish His revelation from the signs of mental illness (since ""hearing voices"" is a primary indicator of aberrant psychology: schizophrenia, etc.).  I might be wrong, but it is something to consider.

Paul Gautschi, on the other hand, believes he has the right to control his relationship with ""god."" ""God"" is always there to answer Gautschi's questions on Gautschi's timetable (i.e., whenever Gautschi wants an answer):  ""I said to God, 'How am I going to grow food without water?' And it was so incredible, I hear inside, He says, 'Well, you're looking at the wrong thing.  Turn around and look at your trees.'  And I pushed enough out when I built the house that I knew they had shallow roots, and I said, 'You know, God, you really have my attention.  If you can show me how you do those without irrigation, I can do an orchard.'  And ""god"" proceeds to do Gautschi's bidding, like a genie in a bottle.

Conversely, Gautschi feels free to tell ""god"" when ""god"" needs to stay out of his life -- and ""god"" obediently complies:  ""As I was doing this orchard, experiencing these incredible results, because I was a creature of habit and our nature is to do things as we were taught, and not to enquire from God, I says, 'Okay, God, thanks for the help, but I can handle this on my own.'  And so for the first 17 years I was out here diligently roto-tilling, hauling in organic material -- and I'm doing this stuff, on a treadmill, just running in place going nowhere . . . . Then one day I got out into my orchard -- I don't know what motivated me -- I got down on my knees and started moving these wood chips.  I'm down to my elbows in this beautiful black compost and I got up and started screaming, I was so angry.  I said, 'There's something wrong with this picture:  I have been KILLING myself to get this in my garden and I don't have it.'  And I hear inside, 'Well, it works in your garden the same way, but you didn't ask.'  I was so angry.  I threw that tiller away, and I started covering my garden with wood chips.""

The real God is not at our beck and call and He doesn't play cruel 'hide and seek' games like Paul Gautschi's ""god.""  We are not in control of our relationship with Him, and He does not pop up and answer questions we pose -- on our agenda, our timetable.  In this regard Gautschi reveals that his idea of god is exactly like that of Neal Donald Walsch, the deceived New Age guru who published Conversations with God in the mid 1990's (and apparently came out with a new book in 2014 which I have not read).  ""God"" spoke to Walsch -- a non-believer who had never given God the time of day -- directly for the first time after Walsch indulged in an angry tirade against Him, accusing Him as being the reason for all of Walsch's problems.  It is completely repugnant to imagine that God would lower himself to respond to anyone in that situation, as if God had anything to prove to Neal Donald Walsch!

And it is repugnant to me that Gautschi believes the One True God, the Creator of the Universe, would stoop to having the type of conversation set forth above (which I quote verbatim from Back to Eden).  Gautschi's lack of awe and pedestrian familiarity with his ""god"" is off-putting, to say the least.",1418601600,,7977,4.6257102272727275

I am learning to keep the wood chips back away from the seedlings until they are well established in growth.  Crowding them too soon with mulch is counterproductive.  I am also learning that if you get wood chips that are a couple of years old, it takes time for the acidic material to leach out of the mulch and become neutralized.  That is why the gardener in the dvd says that his garden keeps getting better each year.  Do not expect full results the first year you impliment these ideas, but the weed control is sure a blessing.

5013363,1,B006QAZQ66,"As a missionary working in agricultural development, I use and recommend mulch in some circumstances. However it isn't the answer to everything.

Mixing hokey theology, poorly articulated half-truths, incorrect assertions, true information, scripture and beautiful photos doesn't help anyone. For the inexperienced gardener picking out the truth from the garbage is an impossible task. It is a beautiful motivational film, that could have been done in 20 minutes rather than well over an hour. Unfortunately the recommended path is going to be a dead end for many people who try it. Deep mulch is a valuable tool in some circumstances, but it can also cause serious crop destroying problems including overly cool soil, fungal disease, mouse damage, imbalanced soils and poor seed emergence. It is telling that the vast majority of the people interviewed in the film have very limited gardening experience. My wife and I recently met the filmmakers while they were scouting our area for their next film. One of them commented to my wife that; ""a lot of people with a lot experience gardening think it won't work"" It might be worth reflecting on that admission.

The assertion that ""The Covering"" is a new revelation from God is offensive. The ideas presented in this film are not new. Well-read gardeners should be familiar with Ruth Stout, the garden writer. Reading her biography on Wikipedia would clear up any doubts about the newness of deep mulch. http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=ruth+stout

Christians might wish to reflect on the unbiblical perspective on work presented in this film. Work is a blessing, not a curse. Adam worked before he was punished for his sin. Certainly we should work in an efficient and intelligent manner, but avoiding work is should not be a motivational factor for a Christian. Rather we should seek to do what produces the best God glorifying outcome, sometimes that may be using deep mulch. Mr. Gautschi's assertion that Adam did not till the soil before the fall is personal speculation, which is not addressed in the biblical record. The featured gardener, Paul Gautschi, is in the Olympic Peninsula where the native vegetation is rain forest. Nutrient leaching is a major problem in rain forests. The mulch is a great nutrient sponge which would help prevent nutrients from washing away. That may be the explanation as to why Mr. Gautschi's garden has done so much better with the mulch.

I assure you that there is no great conspiracy to avoid using God's way to garden. ""The Covering"" usually known as sheet composting or mulching simply isn't God's answer to ALL garden challenges in ALL climates; its just one of the many tools in the tool box of the gardener.

5013366,4,B006QAZQ66,"First up, I should say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this. Paul has a great setup in many ways and it makes you think you can do it too... hence ""inspirational"" in the true sense of the word. The overtly christian tones were a bit off putting at first, but you get the feeling he is a very genuine, kind and generous guy.

However, if you are looking for groundbreaking new techniques or technical information on how/why this works you will find it comes up short.

His system covers

* Using a thick mulch to protect your soil.
* Ideally mulch with woodchips as these promote soil growth (lignin breaks down to durable humus, but he doesn't really go into WHY this might be better than other mulches eg grass clippings, straw, bark etc..).

Neither of these ideas is novel; gardeners have been mulching for generations and there has been research and experimentation into Ramial Chipped Wood since the 1970s.

What he does do well is integrate these things on a large scale - he doesn't mulch individual beds, but whole garden areas and orchards. Repeated applications over years leads to improve moisture retention in the soil, better soil structure and fertility and fewer weeding issues. Weeds that do germinate can be easily dislodged by a quick rake over the area.

Why not 5 stars? Well, he washes over all technical details with the Christian message ""God made it that way"" or ""God showed me it"".  You'd hope in a 90 minute film that some of the scientific details might be explored, even if in only a cursory way.

There are also some obvious critcisms of wood chip applications that are not addressed:

 - Adding carbon to soils is known to limit the available nitrogen. Paul claims to not add fertilizers so how does he get around this? (reading between the lines, he has 30 chickens which he feeds from his own produce. He spreads this manure/dirt over his vegetable beds. Chicken manure is a rich source of nitrogen. I suspect that without this his fertility would not be so impressive.

 - Mulching (with anything) has huge benefits in terms of water retention in soils. Water is often the factor most limiting to growth, so adding any kind of mulch can have fertility benefits, without actually improving soil nutrients.

 - Throughout the film he talks about the ""nutrients"" in his vegetables and how they are juicier and tastier etc... he uses some sciency words, but has no evidence to back it up.

That said, it looks like the system works and I'd consider it at least worth of an experiment - we have some fruit trees that could really do with a good layer of mulch, for water retention if nothing else.",1368057600,6,2628,4.658008658008658
5013367,5,B006QAZQ66,"As a man of faith, I appreciate Paul Gautschi's efforts and willingness to share his experiences.

I found out later you can view in free online, but I still don't mind because this is one film I wouldn't go without having a physical copy of and consider it a contribution/thank you. The growing techniques make a lot of sense and supercharged my motivation to grow more. I can tell you that I have a similar setup in my back yard now in hot and humid Northwest Florida. The covering has reduced the weeds so much, that I actually enjoy pulling what little come up because they pull out root and all with ease. He states in the film that you can talk to tree clearing services and many will dump on your land for free. I actually put this too the test and the first one I asked was willing to deliver future wood chips to another property I have for free. The worker was a little taken back when I asked the question.

5013386,3,B006QAZQ66,"This method of using wood chips in agriculture was developed by Canadian researchers at Laval University, in Quebec, Canada, from the late 1970's into the 2000's. They discovered that branches from deciduous trees under 3 inches in diameter (ramial) worked the best. Branches that are larger than 3 inches do not readily break down and their lignin doesn't have the same effect in producing great fertility and humus in the soil. Coniferous trees aren't suitable for this purpose.

Prior to the Canadian research an experiment was done in New York over a 15 year period of time using hardwood chips, from 1951-1966. They had great results too, but they used branches up to 6 inches in diameter. The results were published in 1971 in an article titled, ""Soil Management for Vegetable Production on Honeoye Soil with Special Reference to the Use of Hardwood Chips"", by G. R. Free. It's on the Cornell University website.

The ""Back To Eden"" movie is good, and Paul has contributed some knowledge from his own experiences, but the specifics about how to best utilize wood chips for agricultural purposes aren't in it. For that information you have to read some of the great articles on ramial chipped wood that can be found on the internet. A few of the best articles on the internet which can be time consuming to find without knowing their titles are, ""Redefining Soil Fertility"", by Celine Caron, ""Ramial Chipped Wood: the Clue to a Sustainable Fertile Soil"", by Professor Gilles Lemieux, and ""The Hidden World that Feeds Us: the Living Soil"", by Professor Gilles Lemieux. If you watch the FAQ videos on the Back To Eden website, in ""The Covering"" video an elderly lady says that when you see mushrooms in your soil it is the beginning of the mulch becoming soil. That very specific detail comes straight from the Canadian research on ramial chipped wood, in which they emphasize the importance of Basidiomycetes (fungi) in the process of pedogenesis (soil formation). How could this lady have known about that if she isn't aware of the Canadian research? Did Paul tell her? The idea of using a ""covering"" is good too, but certainly not new. Mulches have been used by organic gardeners and farmers for a long, long time.",1355529600,39,2220,4.854881266490765

I have watched it completely twice already PLUS taken lots of notes.  :)  We have already enjoyed the delivery of 2 loads of wonderful whole tree mulch!  :)  We have added a lot to our compost bins that just were not quite heating up and breaking down as we had hoped.  There has been too much 'green' and not enough 'brown' material.  Thanks to the mulch, it has heated up immensely!  :)

Most of my raised garden squares have been dieing off, and it has been a hot hot Summer, so I took my leave of the garden until this Summer passes.  I did however go ahead and spread a bunch of the mulch in each square, planning on just letting it feed the deficient soil that is in there for a few months.  I was also going to pull out all the dead and dieing plants soon.  I went outside yesterday to toss out some food in our compost bay and when I passed by the garden boxes, lo and behold everything was unbelievably GREEN  and reviving!  Plants that would never 'flower' actually flowered!  I did not want to use fertilizers, so I was just going to start over with the mulching and see what happens.  I am amazed! I certainly never expected this!  and so soon!  :)

My hubby has been spreading the mulch nice and thick all around the garden area on top of a lot of cardboard.  We have had 2 wonderful rains already to help everything on its way.  :)  It is currently about 6 inches deep.  We want to continue building it up ... to keep the mulch coming until we have all that we need in both the front and the back yards.  :)

We are so thankful for the making of this film!  It is full of wonderful, helpful, encouraging information for much easier, healthful and sustainable gardening and growing of food!

The 'gardener' Paul in this film lives in the state of Washington.  We live in South Florida.  2 extremely different environments, soil, weather, etc.  We have sand sand sand! Sun, sun, sun!  We are excited to be able to finally learn a way to have actual soil to create, build and use to grow food in down here!  It is far too expensive to buy in bags and far too labor intensive to replace over and over again.

This 'covering' technique, concept, theory, method, procedure, solution or whatever you want to call it is truly hopeful and energizing!

If anyone else in south Florida has successfully used this 'method', I would LOVE to hear all about it!  :)

Thank you BACK TO EDEN for all you have shared and inspired!  :)  A truly wonderful and worthy film project!  :)  We have spoken to several people already about this.  One neighbor wants to share this method with her class on water conservation!  She was so excited to learn of this!  :)  We want to purchase a Spanish edition for our other neighbors.  :)

5013394,1,B006QAZQ66,"I was expecting more.
Paul said ONE thing in his DVD:  Ground cover will keep garden soil moist and make it easier to weed. Paul likes wood chips about four inches deep and wood chips are available for free from tree trimmers all across the country.  Outstanding, Paul observed that soil naturally is covered, but Paul did not go into why the major deserts of the world exist.  Too much tillage?
Neither did Paul offer the complete process of how he plants his garden.  He shows the fruits of his labor, but offers no instructions about how deep to plant and what if anything is needed to help the seedlings get through the mulch, how he stops the weeds, etc.  That was it, use mulch, make it family fun to spread it around the garden, make it four inches deep, many types of ground cover will protect the soil, tillage contributes to loss of top soil, etc. and some really lame songs plus Paul's voice is a lot to take in this 103 minute DVD.
It could have been more thorough with a lot less filler and I wouldn't feel like I paid for one ten second idea and sat through a lot of super-lite pseudo-Christian fluff.  There is good Christian music (that glorifies God, may I suggest the Dordt College music department) that could have helped along the theme that men made a big mistake when they began to till the soil.  But the fact is that our federal head Adam made a big mistake and we live in a fallen world, and I am not sure that four inches of wood chips covering the Sahara Desert will turn it into productive farmland.

Well, for starters, laying down a covering of wood chips without adding nitrogen will tie up the free N in the soil for months and result in yellow, dwarfed plants. Depending on whether leaves are in the chips, whether they are ground from green or dead wood, and how soon they are added to the soil after grinding, you may need to add a lot of Nitrogen to bring the nitrogen/carbon ratio up to a level to allow the chips to turn to compost without depriving your plants of nutrients.

Want to grow organically? It doesn't have to be chemical nitrogen. It can be fish emulsion, fish meal, blood meal, feather meal, or any manure, but without nitrogen you may need to wait several seasons before planting.

And be careful where you get your mulch. Many county waste departments offer mulch that may contain treated lumber, chemically treated grass clippings and even sewage sludge.

I made it through though and knew I had to get a good copy in my hands.  I ordered the DVD and watched it with my husband again today.

1.  You should know that the main guy (Paul) in the film is *very* religious.  References to God and Biblical quotes are used throughout.  Two others in the film are very religious as well, but the rest don't make so many references.  We are faithful individuals as well, so it didn't bother us in the least.  I hope the religious vibe doesn't turn others off, because even if you are agnostic or a complete atheist, I still think the science of this gardening method will fascinate you.

2.  It is a low budget production, filmed documentary style.  There is some talented film work and clever effects, but sometimes the camera angles can be a bit awkward or halting.  Paul is fun to watch because he is clearly so passionate about what he has learned, however he is not a skilled public speaker and his speech stumbles over itself sometimes.  The horticulturist has a little bit of a drawling voice and sounds less intelligent than he is.  Still, the things he says are great, and I really enjoyed the variety of 'real people' in the movie.

3.  The OCD part of my brain would like a step by step how-to to implement at home, but you kind of have to watch it a couple of times to sort out what you're going to do.  The test gardens show how the method can be set up; tweaking a little for each environment.  You can 'supplement' the movie by searching Youtube for ""Back to Eden"" gardens and find more people recording their own processes.  It looks like it works in a wide range of climates and with any kind of soil type.  Keep watching when the credits roll, it does give you a helpful overview of everything there at the end.

Overall I am very grateful to have stumbled onto this film.  I can't wait to try it out in our own garden!  I will update when we have results.",1336780800,31,2062,4.298701298701299

It doesn't matter if you are humanist, atheist or Christian, the techniques are in tune with nature and we have found that they work!",1334275200,7,312,5.5

Paul is miraculous and a blessing to everyone who wants to create life from a garden.  His experience comes to us at a time when things are in commotion and this kind of knowledge can help us conserve water, live in harmony with the earth and enjoy the amazing fruits of very minimal labor.  This is changing my little acre of ground and it will be exciting to see it change the world.",1332979200,11,496,4.369565217391305

When the film comes back to me, I again share it again as I feel God wants me to do.  All we need to do is trust in God word follow what Paul says and we can all grown great crops and maybe even feed the hungry with his methods that anyone can follow.",1331769600,13,387,3.8734177215189876
8502952,5,B006QAZQ66,Best video I have seen on gardening.,1529625600,,36,4.285714285714286
8502953,5,B006QAZQ66,Very instructional video on why and how to make a garden that produces nutrient dense and abundant produce. We converted our orchard using Pauls instructions and we were very happy with the results. Even a 15 year old Melrose apple tree that had always been sickly and produced scabby apples turned around beneath the wood chips and became an excellent producer. Pauls techniques challenge all the traditional practices on how to grow a garden and take away so much of the strenuous work.,1524700800,,488,4.891566265060241
