8643795,5,B00IO03I84,This is a awesome movie. I love the fact that stan lee uses himself as the guy who finds the aliens and turn them into comic book superheroes. the animation is excellent in this movie and I think the characters are well developed and that the plot is pretty cool. this movie was made for hard core stan lee and superhero fans. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1399680000,2,382,4.175675675675675
