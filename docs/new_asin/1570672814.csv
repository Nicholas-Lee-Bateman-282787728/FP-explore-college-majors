7797154,1,1570672814,"I did not find this DVD useful.  It was mostly psychological theory.  I was looking
for practical advice on how to lose weight.  The presenter was pleasant, but took
forever to get to the point.",1430697600,,194,4.485714285714286

7797156,5,1570672814,"Doug Lisle is freaking awesome.  He puts his message is plan English, in metaphor, in humor, in such basic terms, that you are able to ""get it"".  Such a refreshing relief to have found him and his method...I could listen to him everyday!  This one dispels many of the myths that one hears, recreates, and continues to manifest.  Check out all his other lectures as they are equally good!  Buy it don't hesitate!",1409270400,3,411,4.575342465753424
7797157,5,1570672814,I loved this DVD. I have read Dr. Lisle's book The Pleasure Trap. This DVD as well as his other - called The Continuum Of Evil are all amazing. Life changing really. I re-watched them both several times. There simply is no better explanation of the problem of obesity and the difficulty in losing weight.,1398988800,4,304,4.545454545454546
7797158,5,1570672814,"This DVD is a life chantger. I enjoyed watching Douglas Lisle he is a wonderful speaker. This will start you in the right direction.
He explains why we over eat. I wish he would put out another DVD telling us how to overcome these emotions and not overeat.",1385856000,7,256,4.354166666666667
