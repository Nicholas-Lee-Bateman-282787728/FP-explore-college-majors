2577317,1,B000FNNHZM,"This could be the worst British mystery series I've ever seen. The period setting basically involves a few costumes and extras milling around on dimly lit streets. Jericho is an interesting character but his haunting visions of his father's death just drag the story down. His team of detectives come out of some stockpot of stereotypes; the crusty but trusted older inspecter and the eager, but clumsy constable. The plots are filled with endless cliches and overheated acting that would make East Enders look like Shakespear. Awful, awful, awful.",1220227200,3,548,5.168539325842697
2577318,5,B000FNNHZM,"Brilliant. We also have the second series and are hoping for more to be produced. Low key but gritty. Love the cars shown in the series. I am old enough to identify every single one shown.
Buy and enjoy.",1210377600,4,203,4.230769230769231

2577320,5,B000FNNHZM,"As someone else said  on here , this is a great film noir .  I received my set yesterday and  am really  happy with this detective series that I usually view on PBS t.v.  all takes place during London of the 1950's .
Nicholas Renton, Diarmuid Lawrence , etc. all good stong performances and story lines .

  I look forward to the next set out in Sept. which I will purchase as well from Amazon . where else can I get better prices and free S/H when buying over $25.00 ?  saves me from driving to my nearest book store or video place which is over 20 miles away .  My library doesn't have everything .  No, I do not have any financial interest in Amazon nor do I work for them .

I also own Foyles War ...sets one, two and three . I shall order set four in July . I'm really looking forward to that set of four as well . A great cast and story lines , many of which are based on true happenings in world war two ...course with the exception of Det. Foyle being interjected for extra viewing interest as well as the rest of the cast . But, Michael Kitchen is great .and how all the senes, cars etc. are meticulously re-created that one feels like we are peeking back in time in Britains during that time.

I think the British do more with a 100 minute  tele -movie then many of the multi-million dollar movies people pay  to go and see here in the U.S.A. at $12.00 and up and more ( if going with friends or family ) and many times feel let down . It has gotten out of hand expense wise for families or just a guy taking his girl out for a movie and burgers afterward ... not to mention the highway robbery for the stale  snacks bought in the movie theaters .  Anyway, these bRITISH  shows have class . KUDOS all round.
  ( sorry I digressed for a moment .) But, at least those folks who enjoy spending big bucks for a night out at the movie have the satisfaction knowing  they are keeping their favorite movie stars in style ...lol.

Now I'll bet there will be someone offended ...lol...don't bother to write comments on my reviews it's a waste of time as I do not read them .
my reviews are my opinions .",1182816000,6,2104,4.092909535452323
2577321,4,B000FNNHZM,"This atmospheric BBC detective miniseries was clearly an attempt to capitalize on the success of the equally fine history-mystery miniseries FOYLE'S WAR; although the mystery plots themselves here are not the equal of the Michael Kitchen series, JERICHO features equally fine acting, better characters, a first-rate insistent piano-driven score, and a much more sophisticated evocation of period (the costumes, make-up, sets, and especially the cinematography could hardly be bettered). Robert Lindsay, looking here like Kevin Spacey's more sincere elder brother, plays the title role, a detective who is a London tabloid media darling but whose private life is nearly a giant void. Most of his cases somehow involve the caf society of the time: in these two two-part episodes (the first in the series), he tries to solve the kidnapping of a wealthy titled Russian emigr and the murder of a great Mancunian track star's new wife and her lover in a London hotel. Among the casts, Francesca Annis particularly excels (as usual), here as the kidnapped lord's arrogant wife in the first two-parter. The superb title sequence evokes the famous Parisian photographs of Brassai.",1181606400,13,1171,5.335135135135135
2577322,4,B000FNNHZM,"I used to work in the West End, near Soho, in the early '60's as a teenager and found that Jericho had captured the atmosphere and seediness of that time in Soho, wonderfully.  It also bought back forgotten memories e.g. block mascara which had to be wetted before applying dipping the brush in it.  Girls used to spit on to the block as it was found the mascara stayed on longer than with water and gave a better look!!

I think that Robert Lindsay was right for the part and is a strong lead to a good cast.  I found it a good entertaining buy.",1171065600,26,546,4.171428571428572
2577323,4,B000FNNHZM,"This is pretty good detective series.  It's better than Morse and not quite as good as Midsomer Murders.  The format is very similar to the superior ""A Touch of Frost"" series.  The two stories in these full length films are intelligent, and the acting is good.  There are three basic flaws: the music is sometimes irritating and always too loud; the camera work is often choppy and gets in the way of the story; and some of the casting (the lead-athlete and the neighbor-hooker in Johnny Swan) is weak.  Still, on the whole, this is good entertainment and worth the price.",1157241600,28,572,4.623762376237623

8124920,4,B000FNNHZM,"Its a 1958 Newsflash!  ""Jericho Receives Queen's Medal."" The newsreel continues, ""Inspector Michael Jericho, just back from the palace, and showing is Queen's award for bravery to Assistant Commissioner Cherry."" That night, Jericho spends his time at a nightclub by himself, trying to forget he's a hero. what he really is, is a workaholic with no other life. ""The only girl he ever loved married somebody else while he was away in the war.""

In the early morning, his loyal sergeant, Clive Harvey, picks him up. A man's been shot in a working class part of London, a  young black man who worked at the bus depot. It just so happens that he had a friend who is a young white woman. Which didn't sit too well with some parties.

Meanwhile, in a mansion in the posh Belgravia area, a maid finds an envelope carrying a note made of words cut out of the newspaper: ""We have got Sir Nicholas. You will have 120,000 in cash when we ring. Call the police and we'll kill him.""

Can the murder and the kidnapping, from different sides of the track, be related? So starts episode 1: ""A Pair of Ragged Claws.""

Episode 2; ""The Killing of Johnny Swan""
First a preview: It's the 1957 international cross country championship in White City Stadium. The whole of England seems to be watching on TV. It's the final lap and everybody goes crazy as Johnny Swan, the best British contender, passes the Soviet world record holder. The announcer cries, ""Come on, Johnny! And the world record has been taken by Britain!... And the Soviets are humiliated.""

Move to almost a year later, and Johnny Swan is now a star. The world champion race is coming round again but he's not letting that slow down the party. As a matter of fact, he and his teammates are at a casino. The high-end, veddy posh and totally illegal casino. And Johnny isn't winning. Jericho, Harvey and DC Caldicott are outside the casino watching arrivals from their car. Harvey groans to Jericho: 'You're not really considering raiding a gambling party attended by the Russian Ambassador, are you?"" The Russian Ambassador? As in the humiliated Russian Ambassador?

The 2 episodes of Jericho Series 1 total 112 minutes each. Thats a nice long time to tell a multi-layered story in each episode. The Jericho mystery series is not based on any books. Series 1 first aired in 2005 in England. I like the series, but I have some dissonance while watching it. It is set in the late 50's, but everything else about it looks and feels like 40's film noir, including the men wearing trench-coats and fedoras. The production values seem a little chintzy.

Jericho doesn't crack a lot of jokes himself, but he doesn't mind when others do. As a matter of fact, he's the perfect straight man.

And though hes driven, in ways that are only revealed slowly over the two series of Jericho, he is, above all, a decent man. To that effect, he tries, he really tries, to not care what people think when he becomes friends with a beautiful, intelligent prostitute in the apartment below his. (Which, again, is very noir.)

I really like the mysteries and backstories of the Jericho series, 1 & 2. It is too bad that the story was not continued into further series, because after watching series 2, you will be most annoyed with the story thread that is not resolved in the 1st two series.

Continue Jerichos story in Series 2:
