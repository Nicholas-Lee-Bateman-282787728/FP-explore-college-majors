8731298,5,B014LAADTM,"Honestly there is nothing new here if you follow armstrongeconomics blog but it is a pleasure to hear Mr. Armstrong give the big picture of global sovereign debt, the looming crisis and  in one talk.

Thank you Martin Armstrong for everything you show the world. There are American citizens with integrity and character. Abroad we only get exposed to the utter scum populating the halls of power - not really different here in Europe - maybe even worse in Brussels.",1454544000,4,465,4.8
8731299,4,B014LAADTM,"The DVD does not add too much if you follow Martin Armstrong's website, but it may be a good introduction to his ideas, if you are not familiar with his work.  The DVD proposes solutions to the economic Armageddon that we seem to heading for.  His solution includes the elimination of taxes and government borrowing to fund government operations.  The funding would be accomplished by creating money out of thin air (since it is now digital anyway), and should be limited to some percentage of GDP, say 10%.  This would eliminate the burdensome and oppressive collection of taxes which kills economic activity.  This would also eliminate funding of government through borrowing which is a tax on future generations (taxation without representation).  The debts are never going to be repaid, and they only make corrupt Wall Street richer.  This is probably politically unattainable and a general default seems inevitable.  Throughout history, ALL governments have defaulted on their obligations.

I am following his Economic Confidence Model.  Although I do not agree with everything, I get the sense that there are elements of genius to his approach and recommend it.  However, I cannot do it justice by commenting in this space.",1453593600,11,1229,5.156565656565657
8731300,5,B014LAADTM,"I watched the entire conference on-line.  Armstrong has the necessary experience and foresight as we;; as intimate knowledge of the subject matter. His Solution would appear to be the only way out of the Maze, problem being that the Life Poleticians are too ingrained looking after their own interest, dishonest and narrow minded and one must not forget that they are told what decisions to make and when. So who has the oversight, that is for you to ascertain.  Have you read MS King the bad war?  Nemesis is around the corner.
