3135333,4,B0014VPFQI,"This is a spectacular documentary of a river and area little known to most westerners.  From the Himalayas to the delta this video covers the birds, fish, animals, plants and people who live in and around the Ganges.

The video would have been better if the places covered were more clearly identified on a map.  While a topographical map is shown throughout the video, cities and places are never identified on it.  The narration is stunningly boring.  The information given by the narrator is informative and of interest; however the voice is one unchanging monotone.

Nevertheless this is an important video, presenting wildlife, settlements, people and of course the river, not frequently covered elsewhere.",1250553600,10,711,5.192982456140351
3135334,3,B0014VPFQI,"Ganges is a stunning visual record of the river and the environment from its source in the Himalayas to it's meeting with the sea in the Bay of Bengal.  This DVD is well-produced with the features you would expect.  The only thing that prevents me from giving a 4 or 5 star rating is the annoying commentary.  The third episode in particular is chock-full of claptrap about the evil effects of man, the virtues of ancient (and thus ineffective) technology, dire unsubtantiated and out-of-place notes of ""climate change"" and so on.

I would have enjoyed this more if they had stuck to the facts and not imposed some sort of policy agenda at the same time.  These issues are so much more complex than how they are presented and that's not really what I thought this video series was intended for anyway.",1247270400,22,801,4.612676056338028
3135335,5,B0014VPFQI,"I loved this documentary.  It starts with the Ganges headwaters in the Himalayas and ends with its delta at the Bay of Bengal.  Not only are the nature shots incredible, but it takes you through some amazing history and civilations along the route of the Ganges.

Great photography, unusual insight into Indian culture, history, agriculture and the like. This DVD is a good product-the average American actually knows very little about India. Who would have thought that the river was/is revered as a god entity? Who knew that the rich northern plains of India have soil 3 miles thick in some places? Who knew about the massive deforestation that took place during the Raj?",1241222400,13,539,6.486111111111111
3135337,5,B0014VPFQI,"After watching this film, I fully appreciate the beauty and scope of the River Ganges. This production brings you from the Himalyas to the Bay of Bengal, where the Ganges ends. The photography of animals, birds, fish, and whatever else nature has put by the Ganges was beautiful. I expected to see more of the religious side of India, but India is made up of many religions, Hinduism being only one. This DVD is about the Ganges.

It depicts the climate changes, the monsoons, and some of the people. Cobras get some good footage, as they slither through homes, and traffic.
You don't get an in depth study of the Indian people, but a terrific film about the Ganges.",1240704000,51,666,4.5966386554621845

It then follows the waters journey across huge tracts of India all the way down to Bangladesh and its low lying plains. As such it is a chronological look at the flow of the river which is a very logical way of organising the story of this mighty river.

Merely a narrator who describes what is happening. The information is good and avoids falling into pedantic use of jargon etc so it is all comprehensible to the layman. But with just a narrator and no presenter the view doesn't really feel involved. There is no sense of going on a journey. You are merely watching the water go on a journey.

Despite this I'd still cautiously recommend this to armchair travellers or those with an interest in the sub-continent. It has the stunning vistas, the wildlife, the raging torrents and the broad leisurely stroll of the river.",1408752000,,1392,4.650406504065041

3135389,5,B0014VPFQI,"This is an outstanding video, easily one of the better 'wildlife documentaries I've seen.  It is extreemely well filmed, informative, and the voice over is pleasant and well done.  The soundtrack is excellent as is the over all quality (visual and audio). Wildlife is the main focus of this film, however there is a significant amount of human life documented in this film, generaly whence the two meet, such as with the wild honey farmers.  If you are interested in Northern India, or wild life in general, this is definately worth picking up.",1269993600,3,544,4.827956989247312
3135390,5,B0014VPFQI,"The incredible photography and the informative comment make this film a Collectible. The Holy Ganga herself, her many moods, her significance in the Hindu culture and religion, the Hindu temples along her banks, all life forms in and around her, the climates and seasons, and her course from the beginning to culmination are portrayed so well. The narrator's calm but effective voice adds to the beauty of this program.

This is a realistic presentation which does not shy away from the modern problems of pollution and the concerns about Ganga's cleanliness, as well as the human and animal welfare along her shores, in the present and future.

One drawback is that the overall map shown does not identify the places commented on.

Excellent program.",1265500800,8,751,5.040322580645161

3369886,5,B0014VPFQI,"This is an outstanding video, easily one of the better 'wildlife documentaries I've seen.  It is extreemely well filmed, informative, and the voice over is pleasant and well done.  The soundtrack is excellent as is the over all quality (visual and audio). Wildlife is the main focus of this film, however there is a significant amount of human life documented in this film, generaly whence the two meet, such as with the wild honey farmers.  If you are interested in Northern India, or wild life in general, this is definately worth picking up.",1269993600,3,544,4.827956989247312
3369887,5,B0014VPFQI,"The incredible photography and the informative comment make this film a Collectible. The Holy Ganga herself, her many moods, her significance in the Hindu culture and religion, the Hindu temples along her banks, all life forms in and around her, the climates and seasons, and her course from the beginning to culmination are portrayed so well. The narrator's calm but effective voice adds to the beauty of this program.

This is a realistic presentation which does not shy away from the modern problems of pollution and the concerns about Ganga's cleanliness, as well as the human and animal welfare along her shores, in the present and future.

One drawback is that the overall map shown does not identify the places commented on.

Excellent program.",1265500800,8,751,5.040322580645161
3369888,4,B0014VPFQI,"A very good work. Tracing the river from its orgin, giving substantial facts about the river, the life, the mythology, the wild life, the history associated with it. The way the river shapes the life in the plains of north India, while having a great religious impact over the Indian sub continent, is well documented.
A commendable work.",1261872000,3,338,4.844827586206897

8256401,1,B0014VPFQI,"When I got this documentary, I was very excited, but when I watched it, it was surprisingly disappointing. I had received this documentary as a gift a long time ago. I had initially thought that is was going to be an in-depth documentary about the RELIGIOUS or SPIRITUAL significance of the river Ganga---yes, that is the REAL name of the river---throughout Indian history. I was expecting this documentary to be about the role that the river has played throughout Indian history. In reality, however, it is primarily a nature documentary with a lot of talk about environmentalism, global warming, and related topics. I mean, if you are an environmentalist, a biologist, a botanist, a zoologist or are somehow interested in similar fields of study, then you might like this film; but if you, like me, are more interested in the religious significance of the river Ganga, its various holy sites (e.g. Varanasi, Haridwar, Allahabad, etc), SKIP THIS FILM. As one other reviewer had pointed out, this movie focuses very little on the religious sites or the role that the river plays in the Hindu religion, but for some odd reason, the director has chosen to make a nature documentary instead since he probably thought that would be more palatable to a Western audience. I suspect that the director decided to focus---far too much, in my view---on animals, plants, global warming, and other zoological and biological topics using the river Ganga and the Gangetic plain as a case study. I suspect that this was done probably under the (false) assumption that because most Western societies---the United States in particular---are largely secular, viewers would (supposedly) not want to be ""bothered"" with discussions about religion and that since environmentalism, global warming, etc are very much in the news, that Western audiences (supposedly) do not need to learn about the significance of the River Ganga to Hindus. I found the fact that the director chose to do this to be very unfortunate. That would have been fine had the director, Tom Hugh Jones been clearer about his intentions or had the director made that clear on the back of the box, then that would have been fine, but the fact is that as both a scholar of religion and as one whose worldview is very much in line with the Hindu religion, I was hoping for a documentary on religion, NOT environmentalism. Don't get me wrong---Global warming, environmentalism, nature, etc are important topics and should be discussed in a film like this; I just was disappointed that they appeared to have been the primary focus of the film. The director could have devoted SOME time on this documentary to discussing environmentalism, but the discussion of environmental issues could have---and SHOULD have---been cut down to ten or fifteen minutes max, while the rest of the documentary should have focused SOLELY on the RELIGIOUS and HISTORICAL significance of the river. The fact is, however, Mr. Jones chose not to do this. That is why, frankly, if I were allowed to give this movie no stars, I would have.",1511049600,,3056,4.970703125
8256402,1,B0014VPFQI,"I love the DVD, which I first saw on Netflix years ago and wanted my own copy.  I've ordered four of these, over the past 2-3 years.  All four are flawed at different points and stick to the point of being unplayable.  Amazon gave me the name of the vendor to contact, and of course they never returned my call.  The DVD itself is five stars; the quality of the product is terrible.",1505433600,,382,4.191780821917808

Usually with a DVD this can be overcome by hitting ""fast forward"" once or twice but not with this piece of crap. I am watching another DVD as I write this, so the problem is not my player. My DVD was purchased new and came sealed. Miserable quality control. It is not worth trying to return.",1498089600,,455,4.416666666666667
