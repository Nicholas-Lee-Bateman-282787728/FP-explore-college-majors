7921640,3,B00004RW19,"Another internet source allowed me to relive another WWF event. In Your House events were typically fun to watch as they were only two hour shows that really focused more on wrestling than anything else. This event was centered around The Undertaker defending the WWF Championship against Stone Cold Steve Austin with the catch being that the Hart Foundation would be at ringside during this match.

Hunter Hearst Helmsley vs Flash Funk. I think that most wrestling fans can agree that Flash Funk (who was really 2 Cold Scorpio in ECW) was one of the most underrated performers to grace a wrestling ring & this match showed pieces of that statement being true. Both men worked well together in what was a pretty good opener with Funk using his high-flying style to Hunter trying to ground Funk along with Chyna becoming a factor as she always did at the time.

Mankind vs Rocky Maivia. They would go on to have better matches about a year & a half after as this as Rocky was still the rookie at this point but did enough to hold his own here against Mankind but this was really just an average encounter but one thing to pay attention to is the continuation of the fans just not accepting the ""Rocky Maivia"" character.

Gauntlet Match: Ahmed Johnson vs The Nation of Domination. This was during the point that the feud between Ahmed & The Nation had just gone on too far to this point as the stipulations here were that Ahmed had to wrestle Crush, Savio Vega & Faarooq (who all seemed to be ""injured"") & if he won, the Nation would disband. There was also a funny side story to this match in that each member of the Nation came in with some sort of injury like Faarooq still being injured from WrestleMania, Savio with a bad ankle & Crush with the flu. This match was also average but I will give it credit in that the story was well told of how Ahmed was worn down against Crush, the underrated Vega went in against Ahmed & soften him up some more before Faarooq was able to just pick up the pieces in the end.

No Holds Barred: Ken Shamrock vs Vader. This was regarded as a shoot fight as the rules to this match was that the only way to win was by submission or knockout. It was a much more unique performance than what you expected from both men as this was one of the stiffest matches that I have seen in the WWF with Vader using his power & brute force not to mention ""stiff"" punching power while Shamrock reserted to his submission offense that actually lead to him debuting the anklelock submission hold & even at one point breaking Vader's nose into four places with a spinning elbow. A unique but great match that had a mix of wrestling & MMA all into one.

WWF Champion The Undertaker vs Stone Cold Steve Austin. This was their first major singles match together but this time, they would not be alone as the Hart Foundation were sitting at ringside & even got involved during the match that lead to some hilarious moments like Austin pulling Owen over the railing to beat him up before Taker punched Owen back into his seat, Austin giving the double bird to Bret Hart & even at one point where Austin low-blowed Taker & flipped off Earl Hebner before they turned back & did the same to him. As for the match itself, it was one of their better wrestling matches as both men targeted each other's legs & resorted to some offense that they never used before such as Taker doing a reverse ax-kick at one point. They would go on to top this match in the future but this was still a great main event to check out.

Overall, this was an enjoyable show with the memorable moments here being the Shamrock/Vader & Taker/Austin matches but with the Austin/Taker match already being released on DVD, this is one I would get cheap or see online.",1262044800,,3744,4.418840579710145
7921641,4,B00004RW19,"I happened to find this event online, and I was surprised by how much I still enjoyed it.  The ""In Your House"" events were 2-hour events, mainly focused on wrestling, and generally light on strange storyline developments.  You spent your money to see what happens in the ring, and ""Cold Day In Hell"" has some good stuff there.

1) Flash Funk v. Hunter Hearst Helmsley (w/ Chyna)
---This opener is a great example of how the company was starting to change the physical styles of the matches, and also just how good HHH really was this early in his career.  Flash Funk's offense is so creative and exciting, it makes some of today's high-risk offense look cheap.  Funk's style mixes so well with HHH, whose style was ""Cerebral Assassin"" long before Jim Ross gave him that moniker.  It all just flows well into a nice contest where the villain's bodyguard helps him gain the advantage for a period of time, only to have the hero fight back with exhilarating maneuvers.
""7.0 / 10""

2) Mankind v. Rocky Maivia
---I gotta admit to something: I am not a fan of Mick Foley's.  I applaud all of the courageous death-defying risks he took in his career, but he kinda bores me for the most part.  Rocky Maivia was someone I really enjoyed watching, so much that I used to wish he never became ""The Rock"".  Rocky's style was more technical at this point in time, which is more of my cup of tea.  On this particular night, Rocky and Mankind mixed fairly well together.  I basically had fun when Rocky was in control, and was restless when Mankind was in control.  If you're a huge fan of either of these guys, then you'll like this more than I did.

3) Gauntlet Match
The Nation of Domination (Crush / Savio Vega / Faarooq) v. Ahmed Johnson
---The storyline was Ahmed had been trying to get his hands on Faarooq to end their feud once and for all.  So, The Nation issued this challenge, where Ahmed would have to fight against each man in one-fall matches to finally disband the faction.  Neat premise, pretty good storytelling, but aside from the mediocre in-ring action, the Street Fight from ""WrestleMania 13"" really should've put this whole angle to rest.  I mean, how much more even can you get than beating the crap out of your opponents with weapons in an all-out brawl?  The first match against Crush is alright, and doesn't overstay its welcome.  The second one against Savio Vega is easily my favorite, because Savio was a gifted wrestler, plus you felt like Ahmed really had been through two grueling matches.  The final fall against Faarooq is about as good as these two usually worked, which is...(IMO)...nothing special.  Overall, I found this sorta entertaining, but don't think I'd revisit again.
""5.0 / 10""

4) No Holds Barred - Submission/TKO Match
Vader v. Ken Shamrock
---Wow!  Could Ken Shamrock have had a better debut?  From the looks of this strong display, I doubt it.  Vader is easily one of the best superheavyweight talents in the history of wrestling.  He fought hard, he was quick & agile, and he could talk well enough to intimidate you.  Shamrock, on the other hand, deserves a tremendous amount of credit for this one.  He had to take direction to keep the seesaw battle going.  He had to use his MMA talents well enough to get over, but not so much that Vader looked foolish.  He had to take a beating, and look both like a professional and like a WWF novice.  And finally, Ken Shamrock is one of the few crossover talents to have a good career.  How many boxers and football players and collegiate wrestlers failed in the WWF? - Too many.  But Shamrock held his own for a few years, and it all started right here.  As overpriced as this videotape is on Amazon, you really should seek this one out either online, or keep searching until a good price comes your way.

5) WWF Championship
'Stone Cold' Steve Austin v. The Undertaker (champion)
---This main event also had a difficult task to accomplish: engage the audience in the match for the championship, while also continuing the Austin/Hart Foundation rivalry.  Bret Hart and his anti-Canadian faction sat in the front row, occasionally interfering or distracting Steve Austin during one of his first WWF title matches.  As much as I hate constant interference or obvious distractions from ringside, The Hart Foundation did just enough to push their characters, but didn't take away from the battle.  As for Taker & Austin, this is definitely one of my favorites of their matches together.  I forgot how crisp and talented Austin really was, and Taker can pull off these technical performances out of nowhere sometimes.  You expect the ""Dead Man"" to just brawl and stare his way through a match, and then you watch him chain wrestle and go ""Damn, he's good!""  There are also a lot of neat touches, most notably Earl Hebner giving the finger to Austin after he's been knocked in the crotch.  This is very fun main event, and one of my favorite Taker/Austin matches.
""7.5 / 10""
________________________________

The only thing preventing me from recommending this PPV is that the Taker/Austin title match is one Steve Austin's 3-disc WWE set.  Plus, the price for these videotapes on Amazon is a bit outrageous.  If you choose to dish the cash, I'm sure you'll enjoy most of this event.  It's a wrestling PPV with no jips, no squashes, and no ridiculous storylines.  If you want spend 2 hours of quality programming, this is a good way to go.

If not, then just look up the last two matches online.  I'm sure someone's got them.",1243728000,,5655,4.75076923076923
7921642,3,B00004RW19,"Thanks to an old tape I found in a box, I relived an old PPV from the In Your House PPV series in 1997 subtitled ""Cold Day In Hell."" Now for those who don't remember the original In Your House PPV series, they were only 2 hours long at a cheap price (less than $20) and were the filler events inbetween WWE's (then WWF) big PPV's like Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, King Of The Ring, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series. During this time, Steve Austin was engaged in a feud against Bret Hart who formed the new Hart Foundation with British Bulldog & Owen Hart along with the returning Jim Niedhart & Brian Pillman...however with Bret out injured, Austin found himself the #1 contendor for the WWF Title against Undertaker.

Flash Funk vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - This was around when the future Triple H was still doing his ""blueblood"" gimmick & match was based off the fact that Chyna, being the dominate woman in WWE at that time, had an issue with Flash Funk's dancers ""The Funkettes"" but the girls were fired before the PPV which killed the entire purpose of the match.  Anyways, Flash (the former 2 Cold Scorpio) was always heavily underrated during his WWE run and this is one of the matches that showcases that as he had a pretty good bout against the future Mr. Stephanie McMahon with the highlights being Chyna (who was only around for 3 months at this time) showcasing her dominance & strength throughout the match.

Rocky Maivia vs. Mankind - Around 18 months before they would begin their historic feud & long time association with each other leading to the Rock N' Sock Connection, they met for the first time here on PPV.  This was just an average filler match with nothing noteworthy past the historical factor as Rocky was still in his rookie year here.

Gauntlet Match: Ahmed Johnson vs. Nation Of Domination (Crush, Savio Vega, Faarooq) - The stipulation here was that if Ahmed was able to beat all 3 members of the Nation, the group would be forced to break up with the funny backstory being that all 3 members of the Nation had health issues going into the match like the flu, bad ankle, and Faarooq's arm still being injured from the WM street fight.  This match itself was again, just average but told a good story here with Ahmed going through Crush & Savio sacrificing himself to soften Ahmed up for Faarooq who ""picked the bones.""

No Holds Barred Match: Ken Shamrock vs. Vader - This was right after Vader's incident in Kuwait that caused him to be under house arrest while this was Ken's WWE inring debut in a ""shoot"" fight that can only be won by a submission or knockout.  This match was similar to the usual ""mixed martial arts"" types of matches WWE would use with Shamrock (ala The Lions Den cage match) later on in that it was a real ""ground & pound"" type of match with Vader occassionally using big strength moves like picking up & tossing Shamrock over the top rope.  This was one of the stiffest matches in WWE history to the point where Vader had his nose broken in four different places & couldn't put any weight on his ankle afterwards to the point where he needed help leaving the match.  Very unique match but a good mix of wrestling & MMA here.

WWE Champion Undertaker vs. Steve Austin - This was more like Austin vs. Undertaker featuring the Hart Foundation because they were sitting at ringside & got involved various times throughout the match. Austin & Taker would go on to have better & classic matches but this one was still entertaining eventhough it's not as famous. This match was known for such funny moments like Austin pulling Owen Hart over the apron to beat him up followed by Taker punching Owen back over the rail and Austin giving Earl Hebner the ""bird"" after he low blowed Taker before both Taker & Hebner returned the favors to Austin.

In the end, this IYH event was mostly filler material with the only highlights being Ken Shamrock's debut and the main event...which is already available on DVD so unless you have a couple of bucks you won't miss, this is one event you can pass on.",1240531200,,4100,4.563265306122449
