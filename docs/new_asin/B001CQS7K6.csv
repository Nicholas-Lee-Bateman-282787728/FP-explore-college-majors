3515792,5,B001CQS7K6,Just wish the emails were a little bit more discreet.  My husband now knows what he is getting because I had to write this review.,1229904000,,130,4.2
3515793,3,B001CQS7K6,"I really enjoy this series (flaws and all) but I was also disappointed that they left the ""roast"" off the set.  I bought the set immediately because I was not able to see the complete roast when it aired, but apparently they've decided to release it separately or something.

I still enjoy the show, but leaving the roast off the DVD set was a dud decision.",1228176000,7,357,4.393939393939394
3515794,2,B001CQS7K6,"This show is entertaining, but it annoys me that a show that is meant to be a reality show is fake. I didn't know how fake it was until I watched the episode ""Gene Down Under"". The entire episode involving Gene buying a football team is fake, none of that happened in real life.
I wish this show was more reality than ""scripted reality"".",1227830400,6,337,4.28125
3515795,2,B001CQS7K6,"The cover of this dvd says 'the complete season 3' - it is NOT.  Missing is the one hour 'Roast' episode.  They have the moments leading up to the show, the planning of it, etc. and at the end of the episode it says 'To be continued...' hmm, well it did not continue on this dvd apparantly.  It is nowhere to be found.  On the 4th disc is an episode called 'Fan Favorites"" and, to add insult to injury, they show clips from the Roast...that's riiiight the one missing from this DVD.  This is very deceptive of A&E home video and the producers of the show and being a fan of the show, do not appreciate and feel duped just by seeing the world 'complete' on the dvd cover.  So be warned - this does NOT have every episode of season 3.  Why they would leave out the funniest moment of the show and leave us feeling let down is beyond me.  My guess is they want to release it seperately and gouge us a second time with the price.  Very dissapointing.  I suppose the next dvd set of this show they will change the opening music and edit down episodes and not tell anyone just like a lot of the TV show dvds that come out these days.  I wish deceptive practices like this would stop.  This is my only complaint with this dvd.  I'm a huge Kiss/Gene Simmons fan but I was really ticked off by this.  Anyone agree with me?",1227744000,21,1313,4.138339920948616
3515796,5,B001CQS7K6,"I just picked this set up...and for well under $20!!
4 DVDs, 28 hilarious episodes, 3 very nice bonus features at nearly a half hour each for over 11 hours of fun ...just about a buck an hour...I can't believe Gene didn't blow  a valve when he heard this price!

For those who haven't seen the show I strongly suggest viewing from  the first season onward....its not a necessity but its a fun story arc.  If I was being picky I'd have to say that it is of course becoming a tad repetitive but it really comes down to if you like the family and enjoy spending a half hour with them at a time...and I do.  I actually wasn't a KISS fan before my girlfriend  kept nagging  me  about the show  and now  I am as big a fan as she. You do NOT need  to be a KISS fan  or know their music to enjoy the show..and  I must say that unlike the Osbournes...these are people not fighting abuse and being  abusive but the oddity is that they are very normal and in  fact in  many ways an ideal family...sort of  a modern day Nelson family!

the production  values are still very high...so  if  you've enjoyed the other seasons...there should be no reason to hold back..I cant' imagine this being  much cheaper...",1227052800,8,1195,4.241071428571429
3515827,5,B001CQS7K6,"This is one good series.  I HATE reality tv, and know most of it IS NOT real, is actually staged.  This one, obviously, is also staged, but done very well.  Funny and it looks like the cast is really having a great time working at it.  Seeing Gene's house and family is a treat.  The kids are fun and well raised.  If all families had all this fun, what a great world it could be.  AND, the show does give us a sense of what Gene gives back to his community, other communities in other states and cities, AND to the world.  Not only his talent, but his sharing what he has earned over time to put back into helping others.  Hey Gene!  I could use a little help here, if you ever get around to coming out to the southwestern part of NM.  Just a little, really?",1273795200,,759,4.0608108108108105
3515828,5,B001CQS7K6,If you like Gene Simmons and KISS then you'll love this ...... If you've seen season 1 & 2 then this is more of the same but great entertainment nevertheless!,1255564800,2,158,4.3
3515829,5,B001CQS7K6,"I have not received this yet.  I ordered it last month.  My emails and everything about this was wiped off my computer when my computer died the last of September and I don't have any details of the transactions from I believe Movie Mars is where I ordered it from.  It has been billed on my credit card and I would like to receive this DVD.  Thanks.

3515831,4,B001CQS7K6,"Well there seems to have been a little confusion about which edition of Family Jewels Season Three to purchase. I can tell you all that it's this release that contains the ""complete"" season three including the hour long roast episode albeit in a censored family time version (all obscenities,both visual and spoken have been either beeped or pixeled out). I did hope that we would get an unrated version of the roast episode but I'm guessing A&E wanted to avoid an R certificate or maybe the uncut edition will get a release at Christmas time. Are you reading this Gene?

Season three is more of the same from the Simmons/Tweed clan. I won't bore you with episode details as I'm not into spoiling your viewing pleasure. I will say that it doesn't matter if you haven't seen season one or two (but I would recommend them),you will enjoy watching how the world of every-one's favourite rock star demon is really not that different from our own. The major difference of course is,lots of money,which he has worked hard for and a relatively easy going lifestyle. I must say,it feels a little more staged in season three but it's still great fun and you don't have to be a Kiss fan. I think the Tweed sisters (Gene's partner Shannon and her sister Tracey) are such good value they are worth the price for this show alone. Very Entertaining,Bring on Season Four!",1238457600,15,1356,4.65
3515832,2,B001CQS7K6,"My wife and I enjoy watching Gene Simmons Family Jewels and have watched every episode except for ""The Roast"".  The claim on the case and everywhere else is The complete Season 3.  That is false and very annoying.  Leaving out the roast was the worst idea ever.  Stating it is the complete season and then leaving out one of the best parts was quite annoying.  Guess I'll have to resort to other methods to get future episodes.",1238198400,10,427,4.4935064935064934
3515833,4,B001CQS7K6,"I think we can dispell the notion that this is a true REALITY show.  But, show me one that is truly REALITY.  That being said, I just enjoy the show.  Gene is so charasmatic.  Shannon plays the beautiful, down to Earth common sense to Gene's chaotic genius.  Their kids are surprisingly normal but still have a bit of that spoiled, sheltered thing.  The first season looked more REALITY than the other two but overall the show is very enjoyable.",1236470400,3,445,4.569620253164557
3515834,1,B001CQS7K6,"As a KISS fan since 1978, I can honestly say that this show is symbolic of everything that is wrong with the band since the Reunion tour of 1996. Like the reunion tour, this show had some novelty value for the first season but quickly became boring and repetitious. I sometimes wonder what happened to the classic KISS I fell in love with, the one that recorded truly great albums like 'Hotter Than Hell' which for me ranks as every bit as potent as the Led Zeppelin or Rolling Stones catalogue.
Kiss in 2009 is very much like KISS in 1979, disjointed and fragmented with no focus or direction. Too much KISS brand and not enough KISS band, it does not surprise me in the slightest that Paul Stanley(alongside Ace Frehley the true creative genius behind KISS) has slammed this show in interviews and has distanced himself from Greed Simmons in recent years. What this band needs is less crappy merchandise and more emphasis on the music, arguably the last great KISS album having been recorded in 1976. Don't even get me started on the Psycho Circus cd, awful in every sense of the word.
My coolest recent KISS memory was seeing Ace Frehley in a small club last year, the flawlessly executed renditions of classic songs reminded me of the band's glory days.
This reality show is just another nail in the KISS Koffin, alongside such horrible endeavors as Gene's awful ***Hole cd, which should have been a KISS coaster.",1234742400,8,1417,4.649402390438247
3515835,5,B001CQS7K6,The one who loves Gene Simmons or Kiss will love this - Gene is crazy - but perfect and this is why we love these DVDs. We bought the 1st two packages so it was clear to us - to also buy No. 3. In germany you are not able to buy these packages and in TV you will always get a translated version - that's boring.,1231891200,2,311,3.656716417910448

8288725,5,B001CQS7K6,I have to say that every episode is as entertaining as I expected. This is my favorite rock star reality show. There's never a dull moment in the life of Gene Simmons.,1404259200,,167,4.25

8288729,4,B001CQS7K6,"I am NOT a huge ""Kiss"" fan.  I like some of their music.  Never gone to a concert.
I started watching the show on ""A & E"".
It is enjoyable.

Now, we can all tell a lot of this stuff is just staged for TV.  You just know because of what you are watching.

Example. 1st episode of this season ""Gene's Best Friend"" when their dog Snippy gets lost.  They end up at that night's concert.  Shannon, Nick & Sophie are there.  Nick's friend who we have seen earlier in this episode & in a previous episode got permission from Gene to come & get in free due to his being Nick's friend.  THEN THIS COMPLETELY STAGED SECURITY GUARD WON'T LET THE FRIEND IN, WON'T LISTEN TO NICK OR THE SHOW CREW.  We NEVER see Nick call his parents about this problem.  Then, just all of a sudden Snippy is found & brought to the concert so we can see a staged chase scene.
And, the same concert Paul was taken to the hospital.

Back of DVD it says this I found interesting  ""their surprisingly charming teenage children"".  That is a surprise?

DVD package.  NO chapter or episode list inside so you can see which episodes on a disc if you are looking for certain episode.
4 discs & they all have the same photo of Gene on them.  Why not 1 for Gene, 1 for Shannon, 1 for Nick & 1 for Sophie?
A few extra features.

Decent DVD package.  IF you are a fan of the show, Kiss fan or both you should enjoy the DVD package.  MAJOR COMPLAINT BELOW.

A HUGE COMPLAINT IN WE HAVE TO HAVE 2 DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE DVD TO SEE THE ROAST.  STUPID & THIS HURTS FANS.",1280534400,6,1526,4.101694915254237
