5795602,5,B00DF3EXY8,i found a lot of beauty and inspiration in this film. the footage and stories of krishna das's guru sri neem karoli baba were overwhelmingly beautiful. this movie stirred a great deal of bhakti within my soul and drove me to tears of sheer joy and pleasure multiple times.,1380240000,,272,4.571428571428571
5795603,5,B00DF3EXY8,"This is an amazing film!  I'm not a big yoga person myself, so I was surprised when I was moved by it and wanted to watch it again. It was heartfelt and told an interesting story about Krishna Das and his path to happiness.  I really liked how Krishna Das wasn't a perfectly zen yogi, but a real person with problems and it was so moving to see how he moved forward in his life. Also, learning more about the Maharaj-ji was fascinating. I wish I had gone on the same journey, but can live vicariously through this film. I strongly recommend this film!",1379980800,22,551,4.288461538461538

5795614,5,B00DF3EXY8,"A Krishna Das song I heard randomly at a wedding in 2011 marked the beginning of a trail of bread crumbs in my spiritual discovery process that has included study of the history of psychedelics, Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, Maharaji, yoga, meditation, Advaita Vedanta, Buddhism and, of course, Kirtan music. KD speaks with a candor and humility that is both disarming and welcoming and that belies the uniqueness of a life devoted to his guru.

His music literally initiated my Kundalini awakening, sending me into fits of bodily convulsions and four straight hours of unimaginable bliss, with visions of existence as a play, where we are simply taking on roles, trading them, and playing out dramas, with the undercurrent of this drama being Life celebrating itself. I will forever be grateful to KD for the example his life has been to spiritual seekers and for his beautiful, beautiful music.",1472083200,,891,4.97986577181208

5795641,5,B00DF3EXY8,"I just came across  Krishna Das in this video for the first time 9 days ago on Gaiam Tv.  I can't tell you how many times I've watched this since, dragging friends over to watch it too.  I immediately looked up everything I could on him and his music.  I found I wanted more video of his singing, so when I finally found "" Krishna Das Live in New York City Vol 1 on Amazon Video, more affordable, I jumped on that (dvd available too). I just keep playing them both over and over.  I just got his book ""Chants of a Lifetime""  and 2 cd s used.  I am Christian and chant an adapted form of the Jesus Prayer, so this is not only for people on the guru path or what ever those reviews said.  This movie is great for anyone one the spiritual path.  It shows first of all a genuine person with an open heart sharing love and his devotion with the world.  It shows stumbling and finding a true saint and the aura of love that they exude.  It shows reality, dry spells, years more seeking. I opened this door and found another mansion !  I've been stumbling in my own dry spell on how to have that open heart of love to all for some time. THIS IS SPIRITUAL GOLD ( so was the Book ""The Way of The Pilgrim but dry spells are part of the process)  He's the best example of public love that  I've seen yet .  I believe if enough people are open to him, he can really change the world !",1436313600,,1372,3.9926470588235294
5795642,5,B00DF3EXY8,"What a tour de force through spiritual experiences, the heart and song and India! Incredible footage from Krishnadas' master, Neem Karolin Baba (aka Maharaj ji) and a sensitive rendering of Krishnada's experiences. His life, devoted singing to Maharaj ji, is wonderfully presented  in the documentary. Special features on the DVD include more than 45 minutes of extended and deleted scenes with Krishna Das & Ram Dass and additional Krishna Das concert footage. Highly recommended for people on the path and lovers of Indian music and chanting",1434844800,,543,5.313953488372093

5795646,5,B00DF3EXY8,Krishna Das candidly shares his spiritual journey.  This story chronicles the ups and downs of a spiritual path - and how the omnipresent grace of his Guru - Neem Karoli Baba brought KD thru the darkest days into his brightest days with the power of unconditional love.  I didn't have the chance to meet Maharaji while he was in his body....but thanks to Krishna Das and Ram Dass - I get to experience Maharaji's grace daily in my life.,1429833600,,436,4.506329113924051

5795656,5,B00DF3EXY8,"Spiritual journeys are great adventures of inner exploration. We wander exotic inner and outer places once we choose to embark on a conscious spiritual life.  And meet many cool people along the way.

Krishna Das' story makes me sing along with him and the thousands who are inspired by his chants. I play them in my car on the way to work and they keep me chill. Great film. Good company. A glimpse into what a heart wide open looks like, feels like and can accomplish.

5795660,5,B00DF3EXY8,"Loved this film. Krishna Das doesn't sugar-coat his story. He finds himself through experiencing both ups and downs, and through questioning his own motives and purpose. Ultimately, we discover that it all comes back to love.. through connection with the Divine, and Krishna Das takes us on that journey in this moving film. Also, get the book ""Chants of a Lifetime"" for an even more personal glimpse of his life.",1412553600,,413,4.914285714285715

5795662,5,B00DF3EXY8,"True, factual report of how a seeker goes about a lifetime search --and then carries through --yet also is able to portray the love of guru with heartfelt emotion.  It doesn't attempt to explain away the unexplainable, but allows an inside look into how the love of guru and God shaped this person's live, as well as the lives of many of the interviewed compatriots of KD.",1412121600,,372,4.552238805970149

5795668,5,B00DF3EXY8,Absolutely love this doc. I saw KD at a small event and wondered why he seemed to be so much in conflict with himself and why he vibrated a distaste for fame. This film beautifully helped me to understand more about KD and his relationship with Neem Karoli Baba. If I were in the habit of purchasing videos I would own this. Overall it was among the best of all my instant view purchases. I have even more compassion and insight into one man's spiritual earnestness.,1409702400,,466,4.430232558139535

5795670,5,B00DF3EXY8,"Amazing Story!!!! Five stars is  underrating it- but that's what amazon supports at best.

Tip: After you have seen the whole Movie go over the Extra Features- that is where the critical turning points have been mentioned in detail.

I had to take a pause from watching to share the feedback - for the benefit of others ( as i always buy after going through ratings- time to return to the community)

Enjoy.

5795687,5,B00DF3EXY8,"This DVD offers a sweet and poignant look at the spiritual road of Krishna Das. If you aren't familiar with KD, he is a heartful and sincere seeker of depth and spiritual experience. If you are a KD fan, this movie gives you more of his journey and his truth, along with more fabulous kirtan. In this evolution of his story, KD shares his struggle/challenge with the ego which wants to come up because of and around his fame and success. What a great and honest offering. As is predictable, he finds the way to soften and to come to the clear truth of his service and his songs. Definitely an uplifting story and a lovely walk in the spiritual aspect of our life.",1396137600,,663,4.354838709677419

I am one of those people but, sadly, I thought it was okay, but--for me--lacked any new or major insight (psychological or spiritual) into how he became this person.  No question, he is to chanting what Dr Spock was to child care:  THE individual who charmingly, graciously, and intelligently made it accessible to all and one could watch it for that alone.  If you've been to a concert, read his book, the anecdotes from KD and others will be familiar.  If you are looking for what's behind the persona, you won't find it here.

5795697,5,B00DF3EXY8,Very compelling portrait of KD.  People who knew him well provided a very interesting supporting story.  The narrative moved nicely to culminate at his experience of oneness.  We will be watching it several times over and sharing with friends.,1390262400,,243,5.17948717948718
5795698,4,B00DF3EXY8,"I first learned of Krishna Das' music in a yoga class, and have a few favorites that I like to use during Svasna.  When I saw this documentary I decided I had to watch it learn more about this person who created this relaxing music.  Turns out his story is pretty crazy, and starts from his career as an American rockstar - I HAD NO IDEA.  Anyway, this is more of a drug, rock 'n roll story than a meditative relaxing story but is totally interesting regardless.",1389744000,6,462,4.287356321839081

5795701,5,B00DF3EXY8,"This was an amazing documentary. I am a fan of Krishna Das and expected it to be about his life story, music etc which it was of course. But it was so much more, it really is about his spiritual journey and most importantly, through his devotion, obtaining the grace of his Guru which allowed him to be who he it. Really worth watching and sharing with your friends.",1388448000,,366,4.318840579710145

5795703,5,B00DF3EXY8,"Excellent!  A must have if you are a KD fan!  I wish there were a bit more concert footage, but the story is amazing and some of the old photos and video footage are absolutely amazing!  I've been fortunate to see KD live a few times, and at Bhakti Fest 2013 ""stumbled"" across KD and a few of his close friends having lunch and they invited me to sit down and eat with them. He is a very humble human being, and he has had to fight his demons as many of us continue to do in our walk. He definitely is the chantmaster... so inspirational.  Now for me to sit down and learn the Hanuman Chalisa...",1385510400,,595,4.05982905982906
5795704,5,B00DF3EXY8,"This documentary filled me with joy and brought tears to my eyes.  It's impossible not to be stirred by Krishna Das' soulful chanting and touched by his devotion.  It was also interesting to hear more of his story and learn about some of his personal challenges.  I thought it dragged a bit in places, but overall was a wonderful gift to the world. It may appeal more to people who are already Krishna Das fans, or who are interested in kirtan and spirituality of an eastern flavor.  I'm grateful to the producers and to Krishna Das for bringing us this gem.  Very inspiring!",1384473600,9,575,4.543689320388349

5795708,5,B00DF3EXY8,"I like Krishna Das' music and like to hear inspiring stories.  I can relate to his story when he felt like something was missing from his life, and it wasn't until he found his spiritual self that he began to experience some inner peace.  There's something about the chants that make me want to close my eyes and connect with spirit, and that's why I find them so appealing.",1383264000,4,374,4.405797101449275

A story of utter devotion to the heart of one's existence, as seen through the eyes of Krishna Das and those who know and love him, One Track Heart delivers. I came upon the music of this spiritual bard when my daughter was dying. I would listen to Krishna Das every night, and it would carry me to the peace that is within us all, no matter what. It is eight years later, and imagine my surprise to first, find this treasure of a DVD, and second, to hear in it that many people are drawn to this masterful music when a loved one is dying, or when other spiritual transformative events are occurring. See this movie, and be inspired by the story and music of Krishna Das. Thank you, Krishna Das.",1383091200,23,750,4.288732394366197

5795722,5,B00DF3EXY8,"Having recently discovered Kirtan music, this film offered an opportunity to learn more about America's leading Kirtan practitioner.  The film delivered much more than I expected.  Krishna Das is truly a fascinating character with a moving story.  It is the story of a talented Jewish boy from Long Island whose experiments with LSD lead him to Ram Dass and then to India, where he is inspired by the master, Neem Karoli Baba (known to followers as Maharaj-ji), to express his devotion through music.  This is just the beginning of a journey in which devotion, music, and grace overcome the obstacles to real spiritual understanding.  Including interviews with Ram Dass, Daniel Golemen, Sharon Salzberg, and several others, this film will go on my list of great spiritual documentaries.  And I haven't even mentioned the wonderful soundtrack.",1380499200,14,842,5.2
