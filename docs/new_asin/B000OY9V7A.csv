2803489,5,B000OY9V7A,"I admit that I never knew of this show until I watched the farsical George Lowe version ""Coast to Coast"" If I were twelve would I like this? For the most part, yes! I liked Johney Quest and the ""Superfreinds"" were my favorite so I'd have to say anything ""Hannah Barbara"" puts out with Don Messak(scooby Doo) and Gary Owen(also Roger Ramjet, not Barbara procuced),and Giny Taylor sounds like ""Judy Jetson's"" voice but I'm not certain; all this would be a big high five when I was a kid!  Having Owen's voice is a bit over the top but then again, ""Superman's voice was just under the manic hero opratic quality of inbelevabiility. I liked it anyway, the radio announcer voice was always a solid ground in dangerous situations! I can remember this style of doing animation, music and acting more than the show so it still stirs something even though I didn't watch it as a kid.",1184457600,3,874,4.531645569620253
2803490,5,B000OY9V7A,"Now you're talking. I've been waiting so long for this that I'm (literally) just about to turn 46. I've had a copy of 6 taped episodes on ""permanent loan"" from the video store to tie me over(I'll now return it and pay the $11,000 fine). Remember that this series came out when the space race was on in ernest and so anything sci-fi or space related was all systems go on Saturday morning TV. Alex Toth was the artistic genius behind this and many of the other sci-fi related cartoons of the era (Herculoids, Jonny Quest...). The opening music is dynamite and it just gets better from there. You gotta love all the force rays, invisibility, fabulous planets... and it's just amazing how many evil insects exist in space.

There is some repetiton of the story lines between this and the other similar series but no matter - this is 60s cartoons in all it's glory. The younger viewers will love it but those who have grown up on TV cartoons of a more recent time may wonder what all the fuss is about - it's history boys so embrace it for what it is - land-mark TV.

2803492,5,B000OY9V7A,"For those that don't remember, Hanna-Barbera ruled Saturday Mornings from 7:00 am (Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel/The Impossibles/Frankenstein Jr.) until

1:30 pm (Johnny Quest) in the 1966/1967 time range. The most interesting point I wish to make is this:

All three major networks had Hanna-Barbera cartoons. Stranger still, I don't remember ANY of them clashing with each other during the day!

In Los Angeles, one could flip from chs. 2 (KNXT - now KCBS/Columbia) to 4 (KNBC/National) to 7 (KABC/American) and catch about all of their

cartoons. (I seem to remember Birdman airing on Ch. 4 at the time) Space Ghost - An Interplanetary Policeman who faced all kinds of

dangerous characters.  What struck me as a child was the way he would verbally joust with his foes - he had an odd sense of humor,

that one!  Gary Owens was absolutely the best choice for the voice of Space Ghost - The episodes where Space Ghost met up with the other

Hanna-Barbera characters (Herculoids/Shazzan/Mightor/Moby Dick?) were the best - I didn't miss one episode!! Dino Boy - Well, I liked the Cave Man (I think his name was Ug!),

I rated Dino Boy as ""okay.""  As much as I liked Space Ghost, it wasn't my favorite Hanna-Barbera Animated show (that honor is reserved for The Herculoids (which

aired on CBS with Space Ghost) and Mighty Mightor (which aired on NBC)), but that will not stop me from reserving my copy for $20/US.

It still garners a Five-Star rating!",1179964800,21,1447,4.809716599190283
2803493,5,B000OY9V7A,"1966 is widely regarded as the year that Saturday mornings became a ritual and an institution for cocoa puff-fueled kids, and Space Ghost was a big reason for that. The brainchild of comic book maven Alex Toth, SG spawned a host of imitators (Mightor, Young Samson, Birdman, Galaxy Trio, Herculoids, etc.) and for good reason; it was the number one-ranked saturday morning cartoon during the 1966-1967 season.  It's not hard to understand why: Great character designs, colorfully bizarre villains, an outer space theme, cool music, the heroic voice of Gary Owens -- in a saturday morning landscape littered with lighter fare like Underdog, Porky Pig, Atom Ant, Casper the Friendly Ghost, the Flintstones and the Beatles cartoon -- kids ate it up.  It was a more serious action-adventure show that catered to youths that couldn't get enough of the live-action escapades of Adam West and Burt Ward on the wildly popular Batman TV series.

What many people don't realize is that Space Ghost shared it's timeslot with another program called ""Dino Boy in the Lost Valley,"" which was an entertaining program in its own right; kudos to Warner Brothers for including those segments in this set. A predecessor to Land of the Lost, Dino Boy features a young boy who is marooned in a prehistoric valley populated by dinosaurs and cavemen.  Featuring plenty of tyrannasaurs and lushly painted backgrounds, it is a worthy addition to any cartoon fan's collection.

What Space Ghost and Dino Boy had that later saturday morning cartoons didn't was actual ACTION! In the late Sixties, partially in response to Space Ghost, parental groups lobbied to have violence of all kinds be removed from children's programming, resulting in bland, lackadaisical programming for the most part. That is why I am jazzed that Space Ghost and Dino Boy is finally being released on DVD! Couple that with the rumors that there is an extensive behind-the-scenes documentary about Toth on this set, and this is a must-buy!

This set contains all 20 episodes (18 season-one episodes and 2 season-two episodes):

2803496,5,B000OY9V7A,"This is the way to do it. All 20 episodes give you all the Space Ghost and all the Dino Boy stories from the original show in the one package. If you enjoyed Gary Owens' voice of Blue Falcon, in last year's Scooby Doo/Dynomutt Hour release on DVD, you'll think he's just right as the voice of Space Ghost too.

This was Hanna-Barbera's first serious super hero show. Space Ghost, Jan and Jace, and monkey pet Blip respond to calls for help from their Ghost Planet, and tackle galactic threats like Metallus, Brak, Lurker, Brago and Creature King.

The last six stories form a serial adventure, in which you'll see guest appearances by Shazzan, Moby Dick, Mightor and Herculoids, which is an obvious cue for subsequent releases of those characters' shows too.

Here's hoping they put out the later series ""Space Stars"" (made in 1981, with Space Ghost, Herculoids, Teen Force, Astro and Space Star finales).",1175472000,70,905,4.788461538461538

2803647,5,B000OY9V7A,"Long before he had his own late-night talk show, Space Ghost was king of late sixties Saturday morning TV. Boosted by the innovative ship and creature designs courtesy of the late, great Alex Toth and legendary voice actor Gary Owens as our hero, this gem of a cartoon still holds up even in the twenty first century. The writing is still halfway decent, considering the low budget the producers had to work with, and the animation is rarely repetitive. Each episode is positively choc-a-block with enough diabolical monsters, pirates, mad scientists, and super villains to give even Superman a headache. There are even cameo appearances by other Hanna-Barbera heroes (no doubt to promote other, less popular programs)

Also included are the ""Adventures of Dino Boy"" shorts, about a Johnny Quest-like kid and his caveman buddy in a prehistoric valley seemingly ripped out of an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel.

After recently watching the cartoons again I also watched the Alex Toth documentary again and it goes great with the 3 books, "" The Life and Art of Alex Toth"" series! The two double sided discs have the Space Ghost cartoons along with Dino Boy cartoons in their broadcast order and I am always careful with handling them so as not to damage them with fingerprints or scratches!

The combination of 2 Space Ghost cartoons and a middle Dino Boy short worked better for this series then for later shows since they ended like a saturday afternoon cliffhanger series. The very first episode THE HEAT THING/THE WORM PEOPLE/ZORAK set up the format nicely with Space Ghost battleing a lava monster and Dino Boy escaping from the Worm men! Then Space Ghost fights Zorak to save the twins Jan and Jace from being blown up! The other episodes follow in similar fashion and move quickly enough in their 20 minute running time to hold the attention of any adventurous viewer! I also got BIRDMAN AND THE GALAXY TRIO DVDs to go with them!

 I later got the series, THE HERCULOIDS, MOBY DICK AND MIGHTY MIGHTOR, SHAZZAN , YOUNG SAMSON and VALLEY OF THE DINOSAURS from Warner Archive on DVD -R format to go with them! The double sided discs with Space Ghost on them are regular pre-recorded DVDS so they won't have any trouble playing on your dvd player!

2803798,5,B000OY9V7A,"This was one of the first cartoons that stimulated my imagination. The hero lived in space and called himself a ghost! He lived on Ghost Planet and travelled around in the Phantom Cruiser. He had two kids, Jan, Jayce and Blip the monkey who shaded his adventures. He was a man, yet his mysterious identity pulled me in relentlessly. I had no idea about what life was like in space much less how wrong the  physics were. I was fascinated by the eeriness of this super heroes galaxy. Oh, and then there are the villains that are truly original and scary. Zorak, Brak, Metallus and the Council of Doom are formidable and forgotten today.

Dino Boy is a forgotten gem and fun for kids who love dinosaurs. The Lost Valley is intriguing. Ugg and Bronty are like Fred and Dino as playmates. The situations they find themselves in are exciting and fun.

Finally there is a nice documentary of Alex Toth, the creator of Hanna Barbera's best characters from the 1960s-Space Ghost and Johnny Quest are his greatest work.

Sandwiched between Space Ghost episodes is ""Dino Boy"" who we get a capsule history of parachuting out of a disabled plane into the mysterious lost valley. Ugh, a Neanderthal helps him along with Bronto a young Brontosaurs (think pre  Scooby Doo.)

Nice transfers and you get the cap off of the three part extravaganza where Space Ghost and company take on the  Creature King, Metalis, Moltor, Black Widow, Brak and Zorak all at once. At the end it looks like they all died when their planetoid strong hold blew up as the Phantom Cruiser exited. Or did they?

2803904,4,B000OY9V7A,"Space Ghost and Dino Boy were both influential products of the popular cartoonist Alex Toth, who also created and drew other similar characters for the Hanna-Barbera studios, including Birdman and the Galaxy Trio and the Herculoids, amongst many others.  One of the most prolific of the Hanna-Barbera superheroes of the late sixties' era, Space Ghost was portrayed as an interstellar police agent in (seemingly) another place and time, patrolling the galaxies and combating evil space villains, such as Brak, Creature King and Zorak, alongside his twin teenage sidekicks Jan an Jace, and their pet monkey Blip.  Dino Boy was a young lad who had parachuted out of a disabled plan, only to land in a prehistoric valley filled with co-existing  dinosaurs, cavemen and tribal savages.  He befriends a caveman named Ugh and a pet brontosaurus named Bronty, and, together, they face various prehistoric troubles.
Originally broadcast on the CBS Channel between 10th September 1966 - 7th September 1968, 'Space Ghost & Dino Boy' ran for two seasons with a total of twenty episodes, each thirty minutes in length (twenty-four minutes without commercials).  Voiced by Gary Owens, Space Ghost and his crew heralded an 8-10 minute initial adventure, scouring the cosmos for intergalactic peace; and also ended on another space mission, with Dino Boy, voiced by Johnny Carson, braving prehistoric creatures and feats with Ugh and Bronty (Don Messick of 'Scooby-Doo' fame) within the middle.  This resulted in three ten-minute segments being made into a half-hour show, as with a few other HB/Filmation shows of the era, such as 'Birdman & The Galaxy Trio' and 'The New Adventures of Superman' for example.
The series is, undoubtedly, a very simple formula of silver-age comic style action, with Space Ghost bravely faring against his alien foes using various power rays from specially crafted power bands and a highly effective use of 'inviso-power', that he shares with his teen side-kicks, turning the heroes invisible when needed.  Suffice to say, 8-10 minutes doesn't necessarily provide the time to get a recurring narrative going, and both Space Ghost's and Dino Boy's adventures are solved fairly quickly, with either Blip or Bronty providing comic-relief to end on.  However, a continuity does seem to progress within the two segments, with recurring foes and friends returning in later episodes, especially regarding the two half-hour episodes finishing the season, seeing Space Ghost face up against the Council of Doom when his intergalactic foes decide to get together to finish the hero once and for all.  This is definitely the highlight of the series, with various other Hanna-Barbera characters of the time making cameo appearances to help Space Ghost out, including the Herculoids, Moby Dick, Shazzan and the Mighty Mightor.
Distributed by Warner Home Video in 2007 as part of their Hanna-Barbera Classic Collection, 'Space Ghost & Dino Boy: The Complete Series' brings together all twenty episodes of this classic Saturday morning treasure on two double-sided DVDs, encased within a card and plastic fold-out tray with newly drawn artwork and episode titles printed upon.  With a total running time of 420 minutes, the series itself is spread across the whole of DVD 1 and Side A of DVD 2 in full-screen format.  Unfortunately, the original air-dating is not preserved throughout.  However, this, by no means, detracts from the viewing experience, with the series presented in its original three-segment format per half-hour episode, along with nicely preserved picture and sound quality, and optional subtitles for the hard-of-hearing.  Regarding special features, Side B of DVD 2 includes trailers for other Warner Home Video cartoon releases, alongside a feature-length profile of cartoonist Alex Toth, creator of Space Ghost, Birdman and many other such characters of the era.  Running for approximately an hour and a half, this profile delves deep into the heart of Alex's professional and family life, determining to understand his passion for simplistic drawing and his erratic relationships with contemporary artists and fans.
Although Dino Boy and his friends seem to have been relegated to HB limbo, Space Ghost and his supporting cast would next be seen in the 1980's Hanna-Barbera team-up show, 'Space Stars', which expanded upon later superheroics of popular HB characters (including the Herculoids and the Jettsons' pet-dog, Astro).  The Space Ghost franchise would further be revisited with the popular Adult-Swim cartoon comedy talk-show, 'Space Ghost: Coast to Coast', which placed our titular hero as the host of his own talk-show, lasting for a total of ten seasons of surrealistic humour, with original foe Brak even getting his own spin-off show.
With additional appearances in 'Batman: The Brave and the Bold'; teaming up with the Dark Knight alongside Jan, Jace and Blip to combat Creature King, and having adventures in various comic series, including an origin story published by DC Comics with a much more serious and grittier tone, it can be said that the Space Ghost character and franchise has an enduring legacy for each new generation.
This two-DVD box-set of 'Space Ghost & Dino Boy: The Complete Series' allows audiences of all ages to explore the foundations of this legacy, whilst enjoying a more innocent time of sixties' cartoon heroics, portraying interstellar adventures around the cosmos with one of Hanna-Barbera's most successful superhero creations, alongside prehistoric fun with Dino Boy; allowed to roam free once more from out of the HB vaults.",1391299200,2,5597,5.308474576271187

From the powerhouse that was Hannah Barbara who were the undisputed kings of Saturday morning cartoons in the 60's and 70's comes this gem space ghost and Dino boy the complete season, the best thing about space ghost and the most important is that he has one thing that all the other super heroes can't compeat with, he and this show just oozes cool!! I remember watching this in the late 70's as a kid(it premierd in the 60's can't remember the exact year) as reruns, the problem was that
You could not see all the episodes or the original order they were presented in, most of the time you would get the same 8 to 12 episodes shown over and over again without Dino boy in the middle as it originally aired (it was a 30min. Show with space ghost, Dino boy and a second space ghost, wow!) I didn't mind I
would faithfully watch anyway, then one day it was gone and I was sad, very sad I had often wondered throughout the years what it would be like to see it and Dino boy again and all of the episodes in order, well now I can!! And I can honestly tell you this disc set is truly beautiful from the art on the box to everything inside (if you know anything about space ghost or Dino boy you will not be able to put this down) high quality all around, the sound is crisp and clear the color has stood through the test of time the picture is excellent and the best part is you get to see all of the original episodes in Crnologic order, you will mainly watch this because of space ghost a intergalactic peace keeper with his side kicks Jan and jace and their monkey blip,(who almost always steals the show, you will grow to love him) as they take down all the space baddies and monsters in outer space, just wait until you hear space ghost declare in his over the top super hero voice ""Jan, jace, invizo power on!"" Good stuff!! But don't count out Dino boy! A young boy who is forced to leap from a burning airplane with nothing but his parachute and ends up in a prehistoric land and befriends a powerful caveman named ugh with the help of his dinosaur gronkk they save each other from all sorts of monsters and evil beings that would do them harm, good stuff!!

2803967,5,B000OY9V7A,"The Original, The Best!

It was fun to finally show my daughter  that Space Ghost wasn't a goofy talk show host that in fact he was the Coolest Super Hero of the 60's. Part of the CBS Saturday ""Cartooniverse"" that kept a kid glued to the TV from early morning until the early afternoon.

I will say I agree with the packaging, it is horrible and a recipe for disaster. I will also agree with the quality, at best it is a well preserved (over 40 years old) film, no remastering was done.  But then when I first watched it in 1966 it was on a 16 (big for that period) inch B&W TV on an antenna signal.

It was good (and a touch depressing) to watch the Alex Toth special as Hanna-Barbera was famous not giving much credit to anyone but them selves. More credit should have been given to the musical directors (Ted Nichols, Hoyt Curtin) and Voice actors (like Ted Cassidy) who were not named.

Toth gave us Heroes in a straight ahead style; he wasted little time for introductions and went straight ahead to the action. We know nothing about the personal life of Space Ghost other then he is the force of good in the Galaxy. He didn't have a girlfriend nor a secret identity. His power (how did he get it?) comes from two red power bands with 3 buttons each (Occasionally I have seen 4). With them he can call of a various forms of energy beams to help. He also flies on his own and has above average strength and vulnerability. With him are wards (paternal twins) Jan and Jace, who don't always go looking for trouble, and the comedy relief is supplied by the monkey Blip who is always under estimated by the villain. They all use communicators, Invisible belts, and Jet Packs for flight (and yeah they can all breathe in space too)

(Warning: This was the 60's and the cartoons reflected the stereotypes and sexism of the period)

He flies the Phantom Cruiser which along with the Quest Jet and the Galaxy Trio's Condor One is the one of most beautiful designs I've ever seen in a craft. Why they changed the design when they brought him back in the 80's is beyond me.

Some feel that Hanna - Barbera has a better legacy in music then in animation and I tend to agree. Ted Nichols theme remains one of the coolest themes in all Cartoon/Science Fiction reminding me of the first 4-5 letters of the theme from ""2001, a space odyssey"".

It is all action, with three episodes, consisting of two Space Ghost's sandwiching a Dino Boy  whom I considered mildly irritating (Know it all kids like him and Buzz Conroy of Frankenstein Jr, always got on my nerves even back then.).

I have also bought Birdman (which I will review separately), I also see the Herculoids (which I can't wait to sink my teeth into) and Mightor have been released. I am waiting for the price to come down before I buy them. I also see that Frankenstein Jr and the Impossibles have been released, that one I will pass.

HISTORICAL FOOTNOTE:

In re-watching the Cartoons, I have noticed something about Dino Boy:  He rides a pet Brontosaurus named Bronty, kids today might be confused because the Brontosaurus is now called the Apatosaurus (old Flintstone episodes must confuse them as well especially when Fred orders a Bronto Burger).  Even more significant is Bronty walks and runs around with his tail up, In the 60's the official wisdom was that the Brontosaurus tail was so heavy that it always dragged, now the ""Jurassic Park"" Generation knows different.

I guess somebody forgot to tell Hanna-Barbera or their Cartoonist found out what took Dinosaur experts longer to discover - dragging their tails didn't make any sense!",1367107200,,3595,4.540247678018575

First you get a Space Ghost story, then you get a bit of Dinoboy, and then another Space Ghost short (except in the last two episodes in which its just three Space Ghost segments ), these shorts are around seven or eight Minutes long each. I find the Space Ghost segments to be consistently awesome, Dinoboy on the other hand can range anywhere from awful to excellent, which more often than not means that on replays there is a good chance the Dinoboy story will get skipped. overall I'd say Space Ghost gets a 10/10, and Dinoboy gets a 8/10.",1341446400,,978,4.531073446327683

2804062,4,B000OY9V7A,"Hanna-Barbera, the animation studio that spawned some 60's television classics as ""The Flintstones,"" ""The Jetsons,"" and ""Top Cat,"" wanted to try something different in 1964 and came up with ""Jonny Quest,"" a 'toon about a young boy, his father, their bodyguard, the boy's friend, and the family dog on a whirlwind adventure throughout exotic lands of the world.  The short-lived prime time series, like all shows from the HB studio, featured good use of limited animation, a great score from Hoyt Curtin, engaging storytelling, and decent performances from the voiceover folk, chief among those young Tim Matheson as Jonny and Mike Road as 'Race' Bannon.

The show only lasted a series but served as a catalyst for the studio to jump headfirst into the Saturday morning science-fiction/fantasy category with 1966's ""Space Ghost.""  However, ""Space Ghost"" didn't quite have the same quality of writing as the other shows and its plots were basically the same:  intergalactic policeman Space Ghost thwarts the machinations of some evil alien bent on universal domination or Space Ghost rescues his two dim-witted wards from the machinations of some evil alien bent on universal domination.

Companion piece ""Dino Boy"" was pretty straightforward, also: contemporary youth (Dino Boy) manages to parachute into a world where time apparently stood still...well, HB's version of time...a world where man and dinosaur, somehow managed to co-exist.  In each installment, Dino Boy manages to need rescuing from his prehistoric buddy, Ugh.

The studio salvaged most of the Curtin's great musical cues from ""Jonny Quest"" and Matheson, now as the voice of Jace, Space Ghost's nephew.

Most effective was the use of future ""Laugh-In"" announcer Gary Owens as Space Ghost's voice.  Owens purposeful ""stilted"" delivery was most appropriate for a main character that was just as much a throwback to the ""Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers"" serials of the past as it was to anything in the mid-60's.

""Space Ghost"" is a true ""period piece"" from a simpler time and should be appreciated as such, especially by those of us fortunate to have viewed it during its original run.

The only extra on the compilation is an overlong tribute to cartoonist Alex Toth, the man behind the ""look"" of ""Space Ghost.""  While Toth is deserving of recognition, the documentary just drones on, losing much of its intended homage to the legendary artist.  A shorter, more concise exposition would have been better.",1295913600,2,2462,5.2025316455696204

2804097,4,B000OY9V7A,Space ghost was the kind of cartoon show that upset people back in the sixties. It is like johnny quest a violent cartoon in which villians and others die in various ways usually getting blown up in this series.  This teaches kids that death is a reality unlike lesser cartoons aimed at preteens to teens  like this one was.  Wb didn't remaster the show but they did put the whole series on here and most of the episodes look pretty good so it's not a big deal. The packaging is lousy but that's ok too and it is cheaper to have two sided discs than four one sided so that's not a big deal to me either.  this is Vintage cartoon fun that even todays kids to adults can enjoy.  These are self contained stories with plots too although it's not like marvel comics where the hero is full of faults or anything but it's sheer fun nonetheless.,1281657600,,838,4.2784810126582276

My only complaint is the packaging.  The discs are dual-sided and the first disc lies halfway on top of the second disc.  I can see them getting scratched up if they are not handled very carefully!

2804140,5,B000OY9V7A,"Wowee!  The original adventures of the occasionally invisible cosmic superhero known as Space Ghost are finally available on DVD.  Unfortunately, it appears that Warner may have left the package/disc design and episode distribution up to the treacherous members of the Council of Doom.  Both of the identical-looking DVDs in this set are double-sided fingerprint collectors.  To make matters worse, they overlap one another on a cheesy digipack holder in a skinny cardboard case.  Side A of the first disc holds only four episodes (each episode consisting of three six-minute cartoons), while a whopping eight episodes are crammed onto Side B.  (That probably explains why my first copy had a defective B-side.)  Disc 2 has eight more episodes loaded onto Side A, and a fascinating 78-minute documentary on the life of temperamental comic book artist and Space Ghost creator, Alex Toth, on the flipside.  Clearly, this should have been a three or four disc set.  But, on a more positive note, the artwork on the cardboard is stellar--with a groovy image of an inviso-powered Space Ghost behind the DVDs, and paintings of Dino Boy, Bronty and Ugh on the outside of the flimsy folder.  And, of course, the cartoons burned onto these inferior flipper discs are classics--incredibly imaginative and filled with cleverly designed heroes and villains.

Included along with the 42 exciting Space Ghost shorts in this collection are 18 stone-aged escapades starring the underappreciated and oddly-named Dino Boy.  According to Wikipedia, Dino Boy's real name is Todd, but his blue-eyed caveman pal, Ugh, knows him only as ""Dino Boy.""  This is likely due to the fact that he is usually seen perched atop his pet dinosaur, Bronty/Bronto.  If he were on horseback, he would be called `Horse Boy.'  If he rode a camel, he would be `Camel Boy,' and so on.  The introduction that begins each story states that D.B. landed in the prehistoric Lost Valley after he was ""forced to parachute from a disabled plane.""  The events leading up to that fateful jump remain a mystery.  Were the lad's parents on that airplane?  Were they killed in the eventual crash that would presumably have resulted from the reported disability?  Was there only one parachute available?  Or, did the other passengers simply grow weary of the redheaded youngster's incessant talking and throw him from the plane in a fit of fury and frustration?

Hopping hop toads!  Dino Boy does have an annoying habit of talking to himself continuously, acting as his own narrator by describing his every action and observation...even in the presence of enemies.  The sometimes freckle-faced child (curiously, his freckles come and go, as if they have their own inviso-power) does not appear to miss his family or suffer from any degree of homesickness.  No, the leopard-booted juvenile is just having a blast exploring this weird prehistoric world from the back of his swift-footed brontosaurus--who looks like a green version of Dino, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flintstones/dp/B0002ZMHVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flintstones</a>&nbsp;fame, and sounds a lot like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo/dp/B0001CNQVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby Doo</a>--and hanging out with his club-swinging Neanderthal protector, Ugh.  Ugh talk funny.  Not know much words.  Dino Boy try teach Ugh to read and talk good, but Ugh not that smart.  Him not sell auto insurance any time soon.  Together, Dino Boy and Ugh battle everything from purple-skinned Worm People to bat-winged Vampire Men.  And, when they're not being sacrificed to the Sun King by beak-headed vulture priests, life in the jungle is good.

Dino Boy is okay, but the main attraction here is the legendary square-jawed phantom phenom, Space Ghost (voiced by Laugh-In's Gary Owens).  This white-clad space ranger's super powers are derived from the red and yellow power bands he wears on his wrists.  With these mighty accessories, the eyeless defender of the galaxy possesses superhuman strength and speed, as well as an arsenal of weapons, ranging from freeze rays and heat rays to energy bolts and force rays.  Without these formidable wristlets, Space Ghost is just a regular guy in a leotard.  Mr. Ghost also wears a rocket pack that enables him to soar through the cosmos, and, of course, an inviso-belt that enables him to become invisible...that is, aside from those obvious white outlines that villain's apparently cannot see.

Space Ghost is assisted by a pair of teenaged siblings by the names of Jan and Jace.  These wondrous twins dress a bit like the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men/dp/190415963X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men</a>&nbsp;and wear Lone Ranger-type masks over their eyes--which, unlike Space Ghost's, are occasionally visible.  Jan and Jace don't own any power bands, but they are equipped with inviso-belts and jet packs, which they use quite frequently.  The junior galactic protectors patrol the starry abyss in their sporty Space Coupe, accompanied at all times by their flat-headed primate pal, Blip.  When there's trouble, they just touch their blinking insignia communicators to radio Space Ghost, who is usually either monitoring the Danger Alert Channel at his headquarters on Ghost Planet, or zooming around in his sleek orange Phantom Cruiser.

Surprisingly, Blip is the true hero of this far-out group, often saving the day by skillfully utilizing his inviso-power to retrieve Space Ghost's all-important power bands--which are typically confiscated by the myriad evildoers that regularly threaten the universe.  Diminutive fiends like the cat-eyed Creature King and the fish-faced Lurker never fail to underestimate the uncanny cleverness of this masked monkey marvel.  On countless occasions, Space Ghost is obliged to offer a grateful ""Good boy, Blip!"" as foe after foe falls victim to his or her own diabolical traps.  As Jace so eloquently puts it, ""Sometimes, he who laughs last gets caught.""

Animation collectors will not want to be without this Hanna-Barbera gem, but be sure to check those discs carefully for scratches and defects.  Flipper discs bad.  Ugh no like bad flipper discs!  Run, Dino Boy, RUN!",1200960000,69,6318,5.524453694068678
2804141,5,B000OY9V7A,"Space Ghost and Dino Boy: The Complete Series
(Released July 17, 2007 by Warner Home Video)  DVD Review by Joe Torcivia

In 1966, Saturday morning TV was forever changed by two landmark animated series: Filmation's THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN and Hanna-Barbera's SPACE GHOST AND DINO BOY, both premiering on CBS.

I've reviewed Warner Home Video's release of the SUPERMAN series under its own section at Amazon.  It was recommended, but cautiously - as omissions and production flaws were plentiful enough to be regarded as diminishing factors.  Happily, this is not the case with Warner's release of SPACE GHOST AND DINO BOY THE COMPLETE SERIES.

Space Ghost is a hooded, costumed and caped super-hero of outer space. ""Space-Batman"", if you will.  As Batman has Robin, Space Ghost has young Jan and Jace as his teen sidekicks - along with a cute little chattering space-monkey named Blip.

If Hanna-Barbera made one mistake with Space Ghost, it was not making it a half-hour series - meaning each story would have been done in the half-hour format, as was previously done with Jonny Quest.  Instead, the ""tried-and-true"" H-B formula of three cartoons per 30 minute show (Two Space Ghost, with one Dino Boy sandwiched in between) was employed, and played to lesser results.

If you're thinking that this sounds a great deal like the formula used in Filmation's The New Adventures of Superman, you're right -- but, with an important difference. Though the plots were just as brief and often unfulfilling, they were, on the whole, better executed, and were more on the order of compressed ""Mini-Jonny Quest"" shows.

Dino Boy is, happily, a better series than I remembered it.  Each show, his origin is recapped in an introductory segment.  A Jonny Quest / Will Robinson (...then popular on CBS's Lost In Space) resourceful sort of boy bails out of a downed plane, into one of those ""lost prehistoric valleys"" we'd all like to imagine really exist.  He is befriended by a strong, protective caveman and a pet bronto.  They run afoul of strange civilizations and stranger creatures for their six-minute segments.

As for the ""Pros and Cons"" of this set...

The CONS:

I'm pleased to say that most of the ""Cons"" that diminished the Filmation Superman set (see that review for details) are not present here.  The series does appear to be complete.  The transfers appear to be of reasonable quality. Minor quibble: The discs themselves are not overtly labeled or illustrated on their surface.  This is all the more inconvenient when discs are double-sided, as these are.

The stories are too short.  So much more could have been done with Space Ghost in the half-hour long adventure format, so common in the years to come.

The level of violence - and death - seen in the show was unprecedented for Sat-AM TV.  This would be more of a ""Pro"", had it not help usher in the crusades by do-gooders and know-betters that persist to this day.

Space Ghost's voice, by the great GARY OWENS, is credited as ""GARY OWEN"" in the end credit sequence.  Owens is not interviewed - nor does he provide commentary for this set.  But, as he did both for the previously released ""Perils of Penelope Pitstop"" and ""Scooby-Doo / Dynomutt Hour"" sets, I can forgive that.  It would have been nice to hear Owens talk some Space Ghost, though.

As with most Hanna-Barbera series, there is only one stock end-credits sequence.  Voice actors heard in the show (mostly as villains) but never credited for this cost-cutting reason include H-B stalwart John Stephenson, Henry Corden, Ted (""Lurch"") Cassidy, the ubiquitous Paul Frees, and surely others.

The PACKAGING is that slimmer, cheaper packaging that Warner Home Video has used since the latter part of 2005, where one disc rests upon another.  You cannot handle or remove DISC TWO without first removing or handling DISC ONE.  There is always potential, however slight, for damage with packaging of this sort.

The PROS:

It's Space Ghost!  In 1966, I don't think it was possible for an animated character to be cooler than Space Ghost... save H-B's own earlier Jonny Quest, Hadji, and Race Bannon.

The writers credited were Walter Black and William Hamilton - both veterans of JONNY QUEST, accounting for the relative quality of the scripts.

A superb voice cast.  Credited or otherwise.

Inspired use of ""stock adventure music"" composed for JONNY QUEST.  Virtually every note comes from JQ, and a very small portion of it will ""roll-forward"" into SCOOBY-DOO WHERE ARE YOU.  Check the opening scenes of ""Scooby's Night with a Frozen Fright"" or ""A Tiki Scare is No Fair"" for examples.

The level of violence - and death - seen in the show.  As I said, this is a ""Pro""!

The ""Ghost Planet"" headquarters and sanctuary!  Batman had a ""Batcave"".  The Fantastic Four had ""The Baxter Building"".  Superman had ""The Fortress of Solitude"".  But Space Ghost had HIS OWN PLANET!  Told you he was cool!

The Phantom Cruiser, Power Bands, Inviso-Power, and Star Trek-like chest-level communicators integrated into the ""Ghost-Gang's"" uniforms!  `Nuff said!

Dino Boy was fun, in an ""episodic peril and escape"" sorta way.  Don Messick's ""sounds"" for Bronty the Bronto made him a sort of prototype for Scooby-Doo!  Indeed, it was often like watching Jonny Quest (...or Lost in Space's Will Robinson) team up with Scooby!  Mike Road (""Race Bannon"" in Quest) voiced ""Ugh the Caveman"", further strengthening the connection with JQ.  It was as violent and full of death as was Space Ghost.  FUN!

After what is assumed to be the original 18 shows, there is a special six-part story with the overall title of ""The Council of Doom"".  In it, Space Ghost's greatest enemies Metallus, Creature King, Zorak, Moltar, Brak, and Spider Woman (...some of whom WERE KILLED during the previous eighteen outings! Minor detail... Maybe it's an ""Untold Ghost Tale"" of the past!) team up to rid themselves of Space Ghost for good!

This is rather an amazing piece of storytelling for the time, as the ""Ghost Gang"" encounters OTHER HANNA-BARBERA TV HEROES (!) along the way.  The Mighty Mightor, Moby Dick, The Herculoids, and the Genie Shazzan all help out as needed to execute a story the likes of which had never been done in TV animation to this point!  I don't recall seeing ""The Council of Doom"" before, but it must have coincided with the start of the 1967 season, as the other H-B heroes present all debuted at that time.  Even with six short segments to work with, the story is rushed and exhibits the occasional plot hole, but give `em High Marks for attempting this one!  Very High Marks!

There is only one Special Feature, but it's a goody!  A documentary on the life and career of Space Ghost's designer Alex Toth!  It is an uncharacteristically LONG piece for a DVD extra, running an incredible 1 hour and 19 minutes!

Among the many interviewees are Toth's two daughters and two sons, Golden Age DC Comics artists Joe Kubert and Irwin Hasen, Warner Bros. Animation producer Bruce Timm, and a number of Toth's personal friends.  Portions of Toth's own manuscripts on his accomplishments and his views on life are examined.  All persons involved seem to portray Toth as passionate and driven, a superb designer and draftsman... and something of an unhappy individual.  Indeed, I'd say that we get TOO close a look at the unpleasantness of the final years of his life. This is quite surprising for a cartoon DVD extra, where a ""good face"" is generally put on most things.

If there is a negative to this great feature, beyond its anything-but-rosy outlook, it's that, while it spends much time on Toth's early days in New York City and later move to California, his family, his career in comic books from the Golden Age thru the seventies and the ups and downs of his life, it hardly touches on Space Ghost.  Now that's fine with me, personally, as I especially enjoyed the coverage of his work done for DC Comics - featuring some magnificent Batman pages - and a closer-than-expected look at this unique individual and his place in comic book history.  But, if my sole purpose for purchasing this set was an interest in Space Ghost, as I suspect would be the case with most buyers, I would probably be disappointed.

To bring this review full-circle, and then to a close, I described Space Ghost as a sort of ""Space-Batman"".  On the special feature, Bruce Timm (not surprisingly) cites Alex Toth's design for Space Ghost as one of his influences in designing Batman for his own groundbreaking BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES of the 1990s.

I highly recommend this DVD set - subject to my personal bias, of course.  Buy it if you are a fan of animated adventure, Hanna-Barbera, Alex Toth, comic books (Silver Age or modern)... or ""anything 1966"".",1200268800,12,8742,4.849426063470628
2804142,5,B000OY9V7A,"Space Ghost and Dino Boy are among my favorite cartoons of all time. I watched these episodes in syndication when I was a kid more than two decades ago.

The voices were perfectly matched with each character, the jazz scores were ideal for each occasion from the introduction to the ending credits, and each story was often thorough and complete within seven minutes, more so than many half-hour animated presentations nowadays.

The Space Ghost episodes were a joy to watch. Many parallels could be drawn between them and the Batman episodes featuring Adam West and Burt Ward. Just as Batman seemed to always have some new device in his little utility belt at exactly the right time, Space Ghost apparently had at least one hundred different rays that could emanate from his power bands, each of which had only three buttons! And whenever Space Ghost and his companions, Jan and Jace, were trapped, the villains would always be so full of hubris and assume victory, only to be toppled by the lovable monkey, Blip, who was always ignored but was frequently the one to save the day.

As for the episodes featuring Dino Boy, Ug the Caveman, and Bronty the dinosaur pet, the setting is a jungle area where giant reptilian creatures and mankind coexist. The adventures are great, and the teamwork involved in rescue attempts overcome insurmountable odds, where you have the aforementioned three protagonists up against tribes that are willing to sacrifice outsiders or heretics to their gods. The stories are simple, yet fascinationg; in fact, it is almost a wonder that they ever came out, since there are those in the PC crowd that might have accused Hanna-Barbera of taking an impolite stab at multiculturalistic ideals. I say, ""Get a life!""

All in all, this is a great collection that can be enjoyed by those of all ages. So go buy this set and be entertained!",1198108800,5,1861,4.824451410658307

2804179,4,B000OY9V7A,"This is the ORIGINAL series, not that coast-to-coast crap bastardization that raped our memories. The fun's all here; monsters/aliens, power bands, cool sound efx,and Gary Owen's voice. Dino Boy is pretty cool, too,predating both VALLEY OF THE DINOSAURS and LAND OF THE LOST by nearly a decade. Watch for an homage to the pterodactyl fight in ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. (which might have inspired this series in part). And there's a cool, informative documentary on the late Alex Toth and his influence on later series like BATMAN:THE ANIMATED SERIES and SUPERMAN:THE ANIMATED SERIES.So why 4 stars? Because the DVDs are double-sided discs, which means unwanted fingerprints and scratches (which were on mine but didn't affect the playing of the DVDs). Also missing, and mentioned by another reviewer, are the linking segments showing interaction between Space Ghost and Dino Boy. Otherwise, everything is intact.

2804180,4,B000OY9V7A,"This is one of my favorite cartoons growing up in the 60's.  The DVD production (visual and sound quality) was excellent.  The only drawback is Dino Boy was included in the DVD's.  I didn't like it then and still don't.  Instead of Dino Boy, I wish they had included the Herculoids.

All in all, a nice trip down memory lane.",1186617600,2,325,4.35
2804181,5,B000OY9V7A,"Yes, the original Space Ghost cartoons are silly and fun, but the real treat on this set is the ostensible ""bonus feature,"" an 80 minute documentary on the comics / animation legend who designed the character, the late Alex Toth. Interviews with family and friends (and former friends) are cut with narration from Toth's famous postcard correspondence and examples of his art (although why some obviously e-mailed low-res jpegs are blown up to the point where the screen is filled with indecipherable gray, blocky pixels is a mystery) to paint a truly touching portrait of one of the true geniuses of the medium. Even if you aren't a Toth accolyte (and you should be!), this wonderful documentary will have you searching eBay for back issues of HOT WHEELS, THE WITCHING HOUR, CREEPY and more.",1186099200,4,792,4.917910447761194
2804182,4,B000OY9V7A,"I was 8 years old when ""Space Ghost"" aired in 1966 and it was my second favorite cartoon (after ""Jonny Quest""). The stories were perfect for a young boy's imagination--intergalactic cop Space Ghost fights alien creatures and evil villains with cool names like Metallus, Zorak and Lokar. With episode titles like ""The Space Piranhas"" and ""The Lizard Slavers,"" what's not to like? (Fun fact: Tim Matheson, who supplied the voice of Jonny Quest, is also the voice of Jace)

I bought the DVD set for purely nostalgic reasons and watching the episodes now I can see they probably won't appeal to anyone much older than 8. Each cartoon is only 7 minutes long, and there's not much you can do story-wise in that short a span--villain shows up, wreaks some havoc, Space Ghost takes him down. But for kids who like outer-space themed shows, it's simple mindless fun.

Recurring plots elements tend to make the stories seem repetitive: the two teen sidekicks, Jan and Jace, get into trouble and Space Ghost comes to the rescue. When everyone else is captured, too often they end up being saved by their pet monkey, Blip. Space Ghost always has a limitless assortment of power beams in his armbands (""My stun ray should do the trick!""). And don't even start on the implausibilities, like how everyone can fly through space with no suits or oxygen! The ""Dino Boy"" cartoons sandwiched between episodes of ""Space Ghost"" are just as cheesy, usually involving Dino Boy, who is never named, escaping from some prehistoric menace.

But still the kid in me gets a kick out of watching these again and hearing the cool music. There is a 90-minute documentary on artist Alex Toth, one of the key designers for Hanna-Barbera cartoon heroes. This was a bit of a disappointment. I was looking forward to seeing his work on the shows, but this is touched on only briefly. Instead it's mostly interviews with family and friends talking about how talented and tortured he was.

If you remember these cartoons from your childhood, or if you're an animation buff, you will enjoy this collection. It's nice to have the complete series all in one set.",1185494400,6,2120,4.784153005464481
2804183,3,B000OY9V7A,"I purchased ""Space Ghost & Dino Boy"" strictly for nostalgia and to revisit this great animated show from my youth. This is another Hanna Barbera series that will leave fans disappointed with the varying level of quality from Warner Studios. Everything about this release confirms it was a rush job by Warner. The packaging is absolutely cheap and the quality of the disc's is terrible. This DVD set consist's of a cheap cardboard outer package and two double sided disc's that sit on top of one another, making them hard to take out. Rest assured because of this poor method of packaging the disc's will get scratched at some point if they're not already.

I pre-ordered this set from Amazon and when I received it the disc's were already full of fingerprints and scratches upon opening the package. Amazon quickly issued a replacement set without hesitation, so thanks to Amazon for getting another set out to me. Unfortunately, the second set arrived and it was covered with deep scratches, more fingerprints and some kind of residue on the disc's. This lead me to believe that it's a quality control problem at Warner, well it seems that's not the case. After receiving two damaged sets, I contacted Warner and I was informed that they don't handle their own DVD replicating process; they just put their name on the final product. I contacted Warner again to complain about the poor condition I received my two sets in and guess what they did, absolutely nothing!

Don't get me wrong, I'm really glad I bought this set but I have seen better quality in other Hanna Barbera release's and expected the same with this one. I am completely satisfied with the level of service from Amazon even though I wasn't happy about the condition of the two sets of this show I received under the Warner name. In the end it's Warner's name on the package and it's them I hold accountable for the quality of this release. I'm still a big Fan of this show and rate it a solid four stars, I really enjoyed the special feature :The Life and Art of Alex Toth.

2804184,4,B000OY9V7A,"I have to admit I find these stories short on substance. Thinking that they were created around the time the Beatles released ""Revolver"" does help but as a viewer I do find my mind drifting because the stories being told generally have NO character development. Often they merely start with a baddie ""showing up"" and creating havoc for no apparent reason and plot points that make little sense. For instance in the episode ""The Heat Thing"" when everyone is out of danger Space Ghost is still determined to defeat the monster and put it back in molten form... while on Jupiter. Why not just Let It Be? As you can see there is no point to the last few minutes of the show beyond ""showing powers.""

However, having said that I can say these sets, mostly all of the Hanna Barbera sets, are worth owning on art direction ALONE. Never mind that this set has a tremendous 70+ minute documentary on the creator of these characters (Alex Toth 1928-2003), but by putting the two together you have the GOLD standard. Sadly the double sided discs afford no cover-art work but the packaging is the only testament you need.

If you need to escape to a world (for 20 minute intervals) filled with the heroism that only the 60's could produce, you cannot do better than *echo* Spaaace Ghoosst *echo*!",1185321600,5,1284,4.602620087336245
2804185,4,B000OY9V7A,"Overall the Space Ghost/Dino Boy set is a good set for the money and the extra 75-minute documentary on Alex Toth is fantastic! The only disappointment is that they did not include the original connecting ""bumpers"" between the different cartoon elements within the show.  These showed Space Ghost and his team interacting with Dino Boy and the caveman as a kind of segue between each cartoon.  Without them, each episode only runs about 20 1/2 minutes, when they should run about 22/23 minutes.  Not a huge problem, but not the original episodes either.  Warner and H/B continue to do this with their cartoon releases.  It amazes me that they've either ""lost"" all of this film material (However, check out YouTube for some of the original Space Ghost bumpers) or have not taken the time to go back and remaster the episodes from what now show on Cartoon Network and Boomerang back to their original versions (Penelope Pitstop was released with the wrong intro music; Scooby-Doo without the original opening and ending title music on the first few episodes; The Jetsons with the annoying title cards for each episode that were put in during the 80's syndication run; the same closing credits on every single episode for both Jonny Quest and the Jetsons).  Do I enjoy the cartoons?  Yes, they bring back Saturday morning memories.  I just wish they were the same memories I had!",1184630400,10,1376,4.85042735042735
2804186,5,B000OY9V7A,"I haven't received my copy yet (and I can't wait), but I recorded all of the episodes over 10 years ago when they were on TNT and Cartoon Network and I have always been a huge fan!  Space Ghost and Superman were my first exposure to superheroes and has been a big influence on my art work ever since.  I never really liked Space Ghost Coast to Coast - especially when they went more adult oriented.  Space Ghost and Hanna-Barbera never really got the credit they deserved when it made it's debut in 1966.  Space Ghost was not only the first HB superhero on Saturday morning - he was one of only 2 superheroes EVER to have their own Saturday morning show at the time - the other was Superman in The New Adventures of Superman.

Also, HB had the guts to go up against the big guys of the time; Marvel and DC and create their own superhero(as well as all of the other unique superheroes they created; and there hasn't been any like them since): one that was totally different from the other superheroes of the time.  The other thing I like about Space Ghost is that it's pure and simple sci-fi fun for the entire family to enjoy...something that's missing in today's action adventure shows.  My son is only 18 months old, but I hope that he will enjoy Space Ghost as much as I do when he gets older!",1184457600,2,1296,4.308641975308642

8187445,5,B000OY9V7A,"The original Space Ghost series is definitely a product for it's time but one with eye popping color and a beautiful canvas from which they created a fun and imaginative universe filled with far out characters and other-worldly landscapes that speak to the young-at-heart. While I would not expect a modern audience to connect with this as my generation did in the 60's, it definitely pushes all the right buttons if you're looking for a fun distraction that takes you to another time and place.

Dino Boy feels a bit like Jonny Quest in prehistoric times minus the technology. A curious but fun side trip that seems to share a common Space Ghost theme with the monsters in terms of design sensibilities. I can't help but hear Scooby Doo with the pet dino ""Bronty"". That's interesting too since it's voiced by the same actor, Don Messick, who would breath life into Scooby Doo later in 1969. So I guess it could be fairly argued the characterization of Scooby was taken from Bronty which was created and voiced back in 1966.

Ultimately this is a great ride for those who enjoyed that original ride back in the 60's or who crave that retro approach that was such a corner stone of all cartoons back in the day when the industry offered a more imaginative and wide open interpretation for artists. The picture is beautifully crisp and clear and well presented. For those who have not seen this in many a decade, you will be warmly surprised.",1492905600,,1440,4.643137254901961
