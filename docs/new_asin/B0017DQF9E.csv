But, the story telling by the troops and the Sergent in charge of this platoon really brought into focus what it was like to be deployed several times and the hardships that came with it, with families, relationships and the mental aspect of intense boredom they could experience, all the while having to stay very sharp and vigilant. It was definitely an hour well spent to see how these brave men went about their days and missions, while still retaining their composure. It also shows the disconnect in understanding that the troops have with why they are there and what their real purpose is. There is no gore in this documentary, but some close calls that kept it real. The journalist who gave all of the cameras to the troops was really able to capture this unit in their true form; experienced, human, mentally strained soldiers and how all of that combines. It also gives a taste of what one soldier reveals as PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and how he acquired it.",1372550400,,1180,4.650717703349282
8265756,5,B0017DQF9E,"This fascinating documentary allows some of our own soldiers in Iraq on security escort missions to film their own missions (within limits) and to tell their own stories about the war as well as what they're honestly thinking and feeling as it all takes place. This is a rather unique approach to studying the war in Iraq; and I really liked this film. There's a certain grittiness to it, for obvious reasons; but the realism and the words of Sargent Toby Nunn and the men under him offer priceless insight and understanding into a soldier's mind.

We see the tension Sergeant Toby Nunn wrestles with as he feels so torn between being with his ""brothers"" overseas and being there for his children back in the United States; and it appears that there is no easy way out of this puzzle. No matter which place Toby takes, he admits he feels guilty about letting down others who need him. We also get extensive footage of a soldier named Jason who tells us in detail about how the war impacted his life and his relationship with his girlfriend.

Without spoiling this for you, I will add that the footage we get of Iraqi missions both during the daytime and at nighttime is remarkable and very memorable. I admired these men for risking their lives to help make Iraq a much more stable country; although I also understood Toby Nunn's statement that he feels the war should have been over by now.

I know it may seem as if I've given it all away; but I assure you I didn't. Watch for more interesting footage with plenty of extra commentary and dialogue.

The DVD comes with few extras; there are a few suggestions for additional information on this topic on the website for the Public Broadcasting System; but other than that all we get is scene selection and I don't count scene selection as a bonus feature.

Overall, Frontline: Bad Voodoo's War is an excellent and unique documentary about the soldiers working hard for our country in Iraq; and I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in this topic.",1259020800,2,2009,4.616246498599439
