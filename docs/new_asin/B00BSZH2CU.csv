8573447,5,B00BSZH2CU,"Polly of the Circus is a good little film starring Marion Davies and Clark Gable. As pre-Code films go, this is not one of the racier ones but its still terrific to see Marion Davies and a young Clark Gable acting on screen. While the film in certain respects actually belongs to Marion Davies, Gable gives a fine performance and its a good example of what he was on screen before his much more macho image sprung to life in later films like Gone with the Wind. In addition, the sets were very detailed and well done; the choreography and cinematography were rather good especially in the circus scenes; and the musical background score, while not too extensive since this is no musical, enhances the film as well. True, some will say that the plot becomes more and more predictable as the film progresses and there is truth to that, but Davies and Gable give such good performances it remains good escapist fare as it must have been when it was released in 1932.

When the story begins, a circus comes to a rather conservative small town where Reverend John (Clark Gable) and his Uncle the Bishop James Northcott (C. Aubrey Smith) are deeply involved in their church work and activities. Polly, one of the big stars of the circus, falls 50 feet when she is doing a high wire act without a net; and even though she has not had a good start with Reverend John the hospital is so far away that Reverend John suggests that Polly recuperate from her fall in his home. John has a room already set up for a guest and gradually Polly and John become interested in each other which culminates in a romance and a secret marriage that, when found out, becomes a disgrace in the eyes of the Bishop as well as the congregation. John must leave his post and he thinks he has another job as a minister but when the other church discovers his marriage to a circus performer they rescind their job offer and John winds up getting a job selling bibles door to door. This causes considerable tension between John and Polly and theres more tension between Polly and the Bishop as well. Polly loves John very much and how she wants to make things right for John and what comes of that is how the rest of the story plays out.

Look also for fine performances by Raymond Hatton as Downey; David Landau as Beef; Ruth Selwyn as Mitzi; Maude Eburne as Mrs. Jennings; Little Billy Rhodes as Half-Pint; Guinn Big Boy Williams as Eric; Clark Marshall as Don and Lillian Elliott as Mrs. McNamara. Look closely and youll see Ray Milland as a church usher!

Polly of the Circus is a must-have film for fans of the actors in it and people who appreciate pre-Code films (even when they're not too racy) may well want this as well. We see Marion Davies acting at her usual best and its a nice example of an early Clark Gable film.",1383782400,3,2796,4.446393762183236
