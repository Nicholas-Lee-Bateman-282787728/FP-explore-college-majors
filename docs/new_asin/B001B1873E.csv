8281061,4,B001B1873E,"Bought this because I wanted macauly cull ins 'the good son' in my collection, and thought if get the bonus of 2 other movies.
'Childs play' was a popular horror title at my local video store in the late 80s but I never watched it until now. Cheesy 80s horror flick but good to have in my collection too.
Have not got round to watching the omen yet, but remember the version presented here is a remake and not the original one from the 1970's.
All in all a good selection of horror thrillers that did not excite the critics but are still fun to watch in their own way",1418428800,,567,4.163636363636364
8281062,5,B001B1873E,"This is an amazing trio. Everyone knows who ""Chucky"" is & the original and the LAST one's were the best. (So the 1st one's a keeper). I remember seeing the GOOD SON when I was a kid and I KNEW evil little brats like that! This movie takes ""Bad Kids"" to a whole new level: the ending takes an unusually awkward twist when the mother is FORCED to make a tragic choice. Honestly, it's creepy and it's good enough to keep you glued to the screen. (Evil little troll!) That kid was awful & a killer! 2 thumbs up. The Omen, well, is just downright EVIL. Evil enough to scare the crap out of me when I was a kid. It's O.K. but one of those films you easily forget! I would've put ""Dolly Dearest"" in this set though. THAT WAS GOOD. This would be cool if I could get it at Target OR WalMart, but NO LUCK. Only Amazon has it.",1417046400,,815,4.037037037037037

8281064,5,B001B1873E,I love how they group together relevant movies for movie geeks like myself. Helps with collecting. Only thing is I don't care for the Child's Play series. But the other 2 are good movies.,1362873600,,187,4.529411764705882
