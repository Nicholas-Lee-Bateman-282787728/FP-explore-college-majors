This is a must-add to any dvd library once it becomes available. Thank you John Nettles, for making this available.",1428883200,3,246,4.488888888888889
7801187,5,1905095317,"Would love to view and review this DVD but its cost is absolutely prohibitive plus I'm not sure I could even watch it on my Region I DVD player.
That being said....I'm sure it is excellent so, by golly, I'll rate it Five Stars!
Meanwhile, I am thoroughly enjoying reading a very good book on the subject,
