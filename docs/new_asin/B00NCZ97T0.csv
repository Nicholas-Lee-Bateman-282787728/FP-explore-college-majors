8677441,3,B00NCZ97T0,"I'm just not a fan of the Nureyev style. Petipa & Ivanov's choreography is beautiful as is, and I simply don't care for the Nureyev changes, they just look odd to me. I'm not a fan of the ending either... honestly, the whole thing just didn't move me.",1453766400,,251,4.25
8677442,5,B00NCZ97T0,"Excellent performance all round - have to admit I made an error of judgment by going to see ballet in Paris all the time lately and never considering Vienna. IMHO the CdB is excellent and on par with Paris at the least. First saw this on satellite and rushed to my laptop to order the BR from Amazon. The finale is the most ""realistic"" and effective of all the versions I have seen live so far (ROH, Paris, Zurich, Bolshoi) ..... no silly boat pulled by swans here and no Hollywood happy ending !",1431820800,4,496,4.287234042553192
8677443,5,B00NCZ97T0,"Beautiful version of Swan Lake. This is the first filming of the Vienna Nureyev version of the ballet since the low-def 1966 movie with Fonteyn/Nureyev. We now have a stunning high-def film with more beautiful designs and a technically -secure leading couple in current Vienna stars Esina and Shishov, both of whom are products of St. Petersburg 's Vaganova Academy. [While Nureyev was grand in '66, Fonteyn was past her prime and the full ballet couldn't be fully appreciated, as it can now, with Olga Esina as Odette/Odile.] Too, the costumes and corps de ballet are improvements on what we saw in the 1966 film. Highly recommended.",1425686400,3,634,4.934579439252336

8677445,4,B00NCZ97T0,"I'll dive right here, for better or worse, to say that I disagree with the first two reviewers about the dancing of Olga Esina here.  Hard to believe that they and I have been viewing the same dvd.  Yes, Esina is visually alluring with a beautiful face, long beautiful legs and very long beautiful arms, plus her technique is spot-on.  So much for the positives.  Her Odette:  icy and removed.  If she ever attains to any love for Siegfried, it's only in her mind and not in her heart.  I shall call her characterization ""self-centered"" in fact.  Her Odile:  That icy Odette shows no vestiges of herself now, and instead this Odile is all smiles and sparkle.  But again, it's ""self-centered"", since she is, quite clearly, playing to the audience and not to Siegfried.  She makes no attempt to lure/seduce/attract him.  Still ""removed"", as before; still self-centered.  I own several ""Swan Lakes"", and Esina's Odette/Odile cannot hold a candle to either Semionova's or Murphy's, of recent issues.  (I can also recommend highly Anja Behrend in Maillot's ""LAC"", should you be interested in a radically different take on this ballet.)

Moving on to Vladimir Shishov as Prince Siegfried:  OK, there's no bravura to speak of in his bravura variations, but he does score points for sympathetic and attentive partnering and for excellent acting.  Yes, this Nureyev choreography is quite Siegfried-centered, so we want someone who is, well, like Nureyev.  We don't exactly get that with Shishov, but I for one will cut him some slack here.

Other pluses:  I generally prefer the Nureyev choreography to that of Petipa/Ivanov, especially for the corps de ballet. (!)  The held-hands pas de quatre (Alati, Avraam, Ledan, Tamai) in Act II is splendidly, superbly danced--a real gem.  In smaller roles, Masayu Kimoto shines as a friend of the Prince, and Richard Szabo is a smash as a soloist in the Neapolitan dance:  dazzling, with great breadth of expression and a real joie de danse.  I also like Flavia Soares, plucked from the corps, as one of Spanish dancers:  much flare and elan.  Highly laudable corps work.

As to the Nureyev ending:  I like it in principle very much, but I can do without all the histrionics and melodrama of the Prince being tossed about by the waves.  And yet again, I saw not even a hint of Odette's forgiveness of Siegfried, only Esina's cool-or-icy demeanor.

Excellent orchestral playing; well-conducted; fine sound.

I am wavering between three and four stars for this--OK, I'll round up to four.",1420416000,6,2519,4.912114014251782
8677446,5,B00NCZ97T0,"We should expect great ballet productions from the Wiener Staatsballett, being in one of Europe's great cultural centers and we get that in this Swan Lake pretty much. I found Olga Esina exceptional in all regards. Her approach to the choreography was both technically accurate and lyrical and expressed her approach to both Odette and Odile wonderfully. I also loved the dancing of the rest of the cast throughout with the exception of Vladimir Shishov. In this version he dances the famous adagio at the end of Act 1, but I have never seen this adagio danced so halfheartedly. It was the only part of this ballet that was a great disappointment. Many great ballet danseurs have danced this: Nureyev, Eric Bruhn, Manuel Legris, and Nicholas Le Riche(you can see him perform this in rehearsal in the DVD, ""Etoiles--Dancers Of The Paris Opera Ballet""). All have performed this with great intensity, but Shishov comes up short. In fact, if I didn't know better I would not have taken him for a principal dancer. This is probably the most difficult solo for the Prince in Swan Lake, but that is no excuse. It is hard to explain how this could be. Does Shishov dance halfheartedly in other places in this production? I will give him the benefit of the doubt and say no. I came close to giving this four stars instead of five but decided it wasn't significant enough to warrant it. I should also mention that while he danced this important solo halfheartedly, it was technically accurate.
This is the Nureyev version of Swan Lake which was first performed by this same ballet company with Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn. One significant feature of this version is the Black Swan Pas De Deux. It is not the familiar Petitpa version but that of the Burmeister version of 1953. It is this version that actually reflects Tchaikovsky's intentions and music, not Petipa's. It also makes more sense since in this pas de deux, the Prince is supposed to fall in love, so we should expect romantic music and that is what Tchaikovsky wrote for it. The Nureyev version also differs in other places but the question is ""differs from what?"" There are many versions of Swan Lake, even those from Petipa. Since there is no standard Swan Lake, it is difficult to discuss what is different. Let it suffice to say that there is plenty of excitement and bravura dancing in this.
There is a famous oboe solo in Swan Lake(in pretty much every version) that is used as a leitmotiv for Odette. With the Weiner Staatsballett, we get to hear this played on the Viennese oboe. Austria is the only European country that uses a different oboe from the rest of the world: the Viennese oboe. That is just a bit of information from me, an oboist!
This is one of the best(and only!) Nureyev versions of Swan Lake and a good one to add to a ballet collection.",1417132800,4,2816,4.645290581162325
