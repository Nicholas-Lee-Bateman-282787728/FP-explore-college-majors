8560676,5,B00B1E6EOK,"I first saw this on tv some years ago. I recorded it to a vhs tape, then later, to a dvd disc. I still have it. When I saw it it's available on Blu-ray, I decided to get a copy. It's the same as I had recorded, but better quality. As for the documentary itself, I was so taken in by the first Time I saw it. On one of my seven visits to Canada, I made a point to visit the park.....in the winter. All of my visits to Canada have been in mid winter. It is a great documentary and I suggest that you should get yourself a copy. Take my word for it, you will enjoy it, even the scenery will get you in.",1472688000,,599,3.7244094488188977

8560680,5,B00B1E6EOK,"This has been invaluable in my Biology course. I show it in bits, starting at the beginning of the year. At first the students are very uninterested, but after the first chase they start to take sides. First their empathy is for the baby buffalo, then for the baby wolves! We made simple true to size representations of each animal and they were stunned at the size of the buffalo.  Throughout the year I would come back to the movie to illustrate adaptation, carrying capacity, resource management, competition within species, habitat and niche, etc.  In 28 years of instruction, this is by far the most valuable and versatile video I have ever used.",1419206400,2,651,4.752212389380531
8560681,5,B00B1E6EOK,This is a rare look at the wolf packs of the far north. I only wish this show was a couple hours longer. It is worth watching over and over. The conflict between wanting the Wolves to eat and the Bison to escape is evident here.,1393804800,3,228,3.9782608695652173
8560682,5,B00B1E6EOK,"The wolves have to protect their young while trying to pick off a buffalo, which can weigh as much as a ton. Using aerial photography we are able to view a lengthy encounter between both sides which lasts for several hours. A black bear makes an appearance and the adult wolves bite him in the rear to protect their cubs.
It is unlikely that you could see a similar encounter. Highly recommended.",1387929600,5,396,4.513888888888889
8560683,5,B00B1E6EOK,This item was purchased for my grandchildren & they really enjoyed it.  Would like to find more of these types of films.,1370476800,2,120,4.454545454545454
