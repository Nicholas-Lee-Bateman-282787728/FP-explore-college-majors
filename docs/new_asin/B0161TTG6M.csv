7455745,4,B0161TTG6M,"I thought this was better-than-the-average fare for a lesbian themed movie.  Editing, acting, cameras work was great.  The story a little weak.  One of the more realistic and not-just-for-titilation sex scenes between women I have ever seen in a very long time.  Wish that the back story of the main character's relationship with the men in her life was more developed, especially her employer.  Maybe less of a road trip and more time in script development along these lines would have been better.",1456099200,2,499,4.963855421686747

7455748,1,B0161TTG6M,"Seeing the trailer, I was excited and very much looking forward to watching this movie. However, it was complete and utter trash. While in general I am a trash person and enjoy my trash, this movie was below trash. The camera work was awful; there was no fluency to the cut scenes, and the (very unnecessary, stupid, and ill-placed) flashbacks were blurry.

Actors were putting more work into their very fake accents than getting into their (poorly written) characters. Each of them was an ""edgy"" version of an archetype of characters we've seen over and over again - basically bastardized Hamlet. The main character E - what shall I say about E? She was an awful, emotionally manipulative human being who used sex to use people. Usually morally ambiguous people are interesting to watch but E on the other hand is an uncharismatic, flat character - more of a paperboard cut out than a person on the screen, this character used pointless angst to draw undeserved sympathies from viewers, and it did not work for me. There is nothing likable about E. Really, I felt bad for every character that had to interact with her. I see no reason why people are drawn to her in this movie. Everyone in her life was manipulated and led on and used for her own selfish, petty purposes. She uses other people to function - her supposedly convenient husband (who I still see no reason for either of them to marry in the first place), women she slept with, her parents, and even the antagonist. E remained a static character and had no redeeming qualities whatsoever - and none of the more interesting characters had a chance to develop as this putz stole the scene with her melodramatic clarinet playing and walking around in random backgrounds.

Villains were screw ups with no true motives or real interesting qualities. The love interest Trish (victim of emotionally abuse relationship) was about to get her life together before E showed up. And how the hell does a lesbian-orientated movie end up with the overused token gay friend who was used as an object to E's selfish ends? Poor Matt and Trish deserved better. The only character who had their s*** together was the dog - and even he got tangled in E's bull s***.

The sex scene was awkward and unrealistic - painful to watch. Ever seen the horrible, infamous sex scene from The Room? Here's the lesbian edition. (And even in this, it was E's unfortunate partner who was doing the work.) It's too uncomfortable to be a movie sex scene; it's also completely unsatisfying, not even good enough for RedTube.

There was a lot of potential but I was catfished by this movie. This was a waste of my money, and I feel personally victimized - as the other characters were - by E. Throughout the movie, I was bored to tears or screaming for people to run away from this sociopath. Other reviews suggest

William Shakespeare and Kit Marlow did not die for this s***! Please, people, don't settle for subpar movies like this if you're looking for an LGBT film. You deserve better. Watch Big Eden instead.",1454198400,4,3037,4.669158878504673
7455749,3,B0161TTG6M,"This was a good Australian production. I wanted to like this movie more than I actually did. After arriving at the sheep farm, I started to think about what I was going to eat for lunch, as the movie failed to keep my attention. I did like the end, and the clarinet playing throughout the movie was very nice. Worth watching.",1453852800,,325,4.344262295081967

7455753,3,B0161TTG6M,"After reading the 2 other reviews as well as the reviews on other sites, I was looking forward to watching this movie. Unfortunately, It was not all it was cracked up to be. The plot was really weak in my opinion and at times they brought things in that just didn't make sense. The concept was a good idea but i feel it was just poorly written and executed.

On a positive note, the acting was pretty good. The actresses had really good chemistry and the sex scene was done well and was believable.

Overall the movie was okay. Worth watching if you have nothing else to do",1451347200,3,573,4.296296296296297

The actors bring bounce and believe-ability to their characters, you can laugh, then say ""oh, I get that"". It's a fun film to watch",1505347200,,263,4.076923076923077

8735405,3,B0161TTG6M,"All About E is a good choice for a night in when you've have nothing to do all day and you just want something to watch. There's nothing too exciting or noteworthy about it, but its not a bad movie either. If anything, it's just a little weird with the plot and mix of characters, like going to a drag-club for the first time. Really, like ""A Lebanese, Irish, and Australian walk into a bar"" type of thing, not that it's a bad thing but it's just kind of odd. The characters are likable though, and the two lead ladies are both very attractive and fit into their respective characters well.

It's more of a finding yourself movie than a love story, which is a good reason to give it a shot when in doubt.",1459209600,2,704,4.214814814814815
