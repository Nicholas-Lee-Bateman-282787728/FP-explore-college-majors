8413021,5,B0041KXVYC,"The film demonstrates that Peter O'Toole still has what it takes to keep the audience riveted by his performance.  The film is an excellent example of black comedy.  It is dark, sinister, and funny as hell.  Well-acted by the cast in all of the characterizations, and the film has a great script. ""The Final Curtain"" is a sleeper that is well worth the price of admission.  Highly enjoyable and watchable.  Don't miss this one!",1378944000,,427,4.716216216216216
