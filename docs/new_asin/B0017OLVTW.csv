8266774,1,B0017OLVTW,"This dvd is a waste of money. It's just a guy talking to the camera 90% of the time. You don't see the Google Adwords control panel or any real tools that can help you to learn how Google Adwords work or how to set up campaigns or keywords. Plus, the video editing is really poor and it is hard to understand the speakers because of his accent.",1289865600,2,344,4.073529411764706
8266775,3,B0017OLVTW,"I purchased this DVD package to learn how to get an edge with Google AdWords. While the workshop is a good overview of AdWords, it really doesn't provide any unique information. I really didn't learn anything new from this workshop. If you don't know anything about AdWords, this would be a good starting point. However, if you really want an edge, checkout ""Mastering Search Advertising: How the Top 3% of Search Advertisers Dominate Google AdWords"" which I bought at the same time. While some might complain that this book is a marketing piece for their website/service, it really has some unique insights based on real experience. How well you AdWords campaign is running can make or break your business. Spend the extra effort to get it right.",1221782400,5,747,4.889763779527559
