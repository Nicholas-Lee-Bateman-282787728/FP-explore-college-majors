children that provide wholesome family morals and values.",1353628800,,191,4.647058823529412
1039178,2,6305457999,"From the sappy and nonsensical theme song to its sophomoric and inane plots, if you enjoy mocking poorly written and acted TV shows this one has it all. The family is watched over by a goat and a dog who protect them against their evil antagonist, Parsons (K.C.Kelly). He's about as evil as your average Muppet. You constantly wonder why dad dosent just blow the bad guy away when he gets the drop on him. No, dad consistently puts his gun down and becomes Parsons prisoner. Certain that Parsons will honor his promise to leave his family alone. No one seems to listen to the father, David (Richard Thomas) or Ernst (Kieren Hutchison). Ernst's tag line should be, ""Hey come back here!"" as the others run off. The show promotes an strange syncretic mix of native and and christian religion. If you want conservative christian values look elsewhere. Thomas buries this 31 episode work on his Wikipedia page. Instead, listing his 2 appearances on Touched by an Angel.

Yes we can laugh at this series but only because we got it for free.",1349308800,5,1034,4.6502732240437155
1039179,5,6305457999,"A likeable cast. Shot on location in Fiji. Nice costumes; nice sets; nice tree-house. Different stories than the Disney story.

Compared to the lousy stuff available on TV today; this is 5-stars. The script-writing jumps back and forth between 3 and 4 stars due to some moments of bad script writing here and there. However, they pack a lot of adventures into every episode; moving between three different sub-plots throughout an episode, thus there is always something to hold your attention. You enjoy spending time on the tropical island with the characters and sharing their adventures.",1339718400,,590,5.145833333333333
1039180,4,6305457999,"As a series for television, not a bad take on the Swiss Family Robinson story. Still a great escape for half an hour - each episode - and the scenery is stunning and makes you want to become lost... if only being stranded on a paradise could be as easy as that!

This is classic family entertainment and if you like all things Swiss Family Robinson, then it is a must have to add to your collection.",1246060800,9,399,4.181818181818182
1039181,5,6305457999,"It tells the story of the robinson family stranded on a beautiful island, defending themselves in every episode against pirates and the forces of nature. It keeps you on the edge of your seat in every episode and you can't wait to see the next one. The setting is gorgeous on Fidji and in New Zealand.",1232496000,3,301,4.392857142857143
1039182,5,6305457999,"My family and I just finished watching this series and we were not disappointd in the least, IT WAS JUST GREAT!! I grew up watching Richard Thomas when I was a teenager. He did a fantastic father role and ALL the other characters were just as great!! It was a great cast, a great story line, complete drama from the very first to the very last minute. I have never had a story keep me on my toes so completely for the entire story. What an achievement!! The photography and the scenery were just fantastic . . . made you want to walk through the TV and join them. The actors/actresses were just perfect in their roles as they unfolded, and became a family, which seemed to really happen before our eyes!! I can't say enough good about it . . . and my family from 10-21 boys and girls were just as HAPPY as I!!!  Wish there was a sequel to it 10 years later!! Great family entertainment with great family values and enough mystery and intrigue to go along to make it just right. The best thing there is in TELEVISION!! Richard, you didn't disappoint at all. I expected much from you and you did just that. Thanks for making this series. Please do some more!!!",1179360000,19,1158,4.3119266055045875
1039183,4,6305457999,"Good serialized storyline. Excellent footage combining studio and locations. Good cast.

The only thing they could have improved was condensing the packaging. Six large DVD cases takes up too much shelf space for bulk collectors like myself. Other serieses have been released single cases with folding DVD holders a fraction of the size.

But buy it anyway. The later episodes will keep you glued to the TV, and the earlier ones will set the mood for that.

1039308,5,6305457999,"This is a show the whole family can watch. You can't say that much anymore these days. I grew up watching Richard Thomas in the series the Walton's. He was perfect for that show and this one. I do however wish they hadn't changed the characters. People has commented on the acting, but remember is was a series in the 90 's.  It may not be Academy Award material, but the fact that go eac show has good family and Christian values, makes it all worth it.",1391817600,,454,4.218390804597701
1039309,1,6305457999,"So, these are corny, bad acting and the characters are not depicted like the true family.  Seriously, who messes with a classic and changes the genders of the kids and the good natured wife into some nagging, selfish woman?  I think the series would've been a 3 star for me if the wife wasn't so rude.  Yikes.  A return was a no brainer for us!",1391212800,5,344,4.246153846153846

1039311,1,6305457999,I had difficulty watching these DVD's.  The image was distorted and everyone looked short  and fat.  Their noses looked longer than was anatomically possible.  This was so distracting that I really found it difficult to enjoy the story.,1386979200,,236,5.131578947368421

1039399,5,6305457999,"I fell in love with this series as a child and ended up buying all the tapes before DVDs became standard format about 9 years ago.  Great family friendly series!  My very conservative pastor uncle was insulted by the natives' lack of clothing, but nothing is shown and I find it quite tasteful.  They are island people!  It's hot!  Come on.  Your kids are going to be too mesmerized by the scenery and the story to notice.",1354406400,,422,4.415584415584416
