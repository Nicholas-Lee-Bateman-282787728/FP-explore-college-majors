8207758,2,B000T4SX3S,"This DVD (originally issued by Cromwell in 1998) is the last in a series of four covering the Eastern front from June 1941 to May 1945.  As with the preceding three, it is valuable for the interview of Professor Erickson, and only for that.

It covers almost two years of conflict on the Russian front, from the Kursk battle in July 1943 to the Berlin battle in April 1945, with sidelines to operations in Sicily (July 1943), Italy (September 1943) and Normandy (June 1944).  Such an amount of material is difficult to cover properly in a short video:
- Those familiar with the subject matter will be disappointed by the lack of details: for example, the battle of Berlin is quickly glanced over and Konev with his 1st Ukrainian Front (the southern pincer to Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front) is not even mentioned;
- Those using this video as an introduction to a summary of the Eastern front will likely be overwhelmed by the numerous details which are not properly coordinated (Kursk, Orel, Belgorod, Kharkov, Smolensk, Dniepr, Leningrad, Warsaw, Finland, Courland, Balkans, Oder, Neisse, etc) because of a lack of maps.

The video concludes with interesting statistics about the cost of the war to the Soviets, but does not analyze the cost to the Germans, which I found one-sided.  The treks of refugees from East Prussia, Pomerania and Warthegau are not mentioned, nor are the reprisals of the Red Army on the German civil population (see Kershaw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-End-The-Defiance-and-Destruction-of-Hitler-s-Germany-1944-1945/dp/1594203148/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The End: The Defiance and Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1944-1945</a>, Beevor&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fall-of-Berlin-1945/dp/0142002801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fall of Berlin 1945</a>).
