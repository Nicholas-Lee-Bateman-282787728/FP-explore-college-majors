7829118,5,6302661218,"This was during the Bill Watts era of WCW. While it wasn't its most successful, it was arguably its most action packed era!

The Battlebowl tournament is shown in highlights to what you get here is the Battlebowl itself plus the non-Battlebowl bouts. The non-Battlebowl bouts, by the way, are unedited and shown in their entirety:

The Great Muta Vs. Masa Chono (NWA World Title Match) - For you history buffs out there, this match took place a few days prior the very bloody IWGP title match between Muta and Hiro Hase in Japan.

As for Muta/Chono itself, it wasn't a bad match but their title Vs. title rematch in Japan a month later was better! This encounter was almost all Muta until he missed his moonsault. From there, Chono took advantage and gained a submission victory with his STF! As a fan, I wish Chono would come over and show a certain WWE star how to do the STF right! LOL!

Barry Windham/Brian Pillman Vs. Ricky Steamboat/Shane Douglas (NWA/WCW World Tag Team Title Match) - Awesome tag team match! I think of this one as a lost classic! It was that good! This one should be on anyone's ""Best Of Tag Team"" list!

Ron Simmons Vs. ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams (WCW World Title Match) - Simmons' original opponent was ""Ravashing"" Rick Rude but Steve Williams filled in for him when Rude went down with a neck injury. This match wasn't great but it wasn't bad. It actually ended in a draw but Williams attacked Simmons after the match, thus the referee made a rare decision reversal and awarded the bout to Ron Simmons.

Sting Vs. Vader - This was possibly their best match together and they've had a lot of great bouts together! Vader's power and surprising mobility Vs. Sting's power, agility and heart! This was one of their best bouts in their entire career and no words I give it could do it justice! SEE IT!

Battlebowl match - This involved ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams, Barry Windham, Dustin Rhodes, Vader, Sting, The Great Muta, Dan Spivey and Van Hammer.

Anyway, the two favorites to win (Sting/Vader) got eliminated by each other earlier on so it was anyone's ballgame at that point! The ending saw Muta dropkick Windham out of the ring for an upset win!

Overall, a great video to get but I wouldn't pay $60 for it here unless it was in mint condition! Still, if you want to see it that bad, then its worth it!",1210118400,,2332,4.533333333333333
7829119,5,6302661218,this tape is pretty good although turner has edited this event heavily its still a good buy. this tape features the best match i've ever seen sting and vader have and is recommended for that alone.,1203206400,,197,4.5
7829120,5,6302661218,"The event was pretty solid, the BattleBowl Matches(Dangerous Dan Spivey/Heavy Metal Van Hammer v Johnny B. Badd/Cactus Jack =2 stars, bad!,Big Van Vader/Dustin Rhodes v Masaherio Chono/The Barbarian =2 1/2 stars, better than match one but still bad, Flyin' Brian Pillman/2 Cold Scrorpio v Barry Whindam/The Great Muta =3 stars, funny thing is that later Whindam/Pillman would team for the Tag Team Titles, and last, Kensuke Sasaki/Jushin Thunder Liger v Dr. Death Steve Williams/ last years' BattleBowl winner Sting =4 stars)were pretty good though the best was the King of Cable finals, and the BattleBowl match(Spivey v Hammer v Vader v Rhodes v Whindam v Muta v Dr. Death v Sting = 5 stars, winner being The Great Muta !",1122854400,,723,5.033333333333333
