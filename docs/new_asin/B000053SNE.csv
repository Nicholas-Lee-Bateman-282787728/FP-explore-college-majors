1389750,3,B000053SNE,"What I liked about it:
- I think real Indians were used in this movie: I wonder if some were related to those that fought in the Battle of the Little Big Horn.
- The actress playing Libbie was pretty enough to do the role.
- May be the best physical looking Custer I've seen.  He had the extremely bushy mustache, and his long hair was good and curly.

What I didn't like about it:
- Most of the movie was fictional.
- The Indian camp at the Little Big Horn showed like six tipis.
- The battle (LBH) only started during the last 13 minutes of the film.

The only thing it might be good for is to see it once if you haven't seen it before.  And to add to your Custer collection.",1409788800,,677,3.9925925925925925
1389751,1,B000053SNE,"Did not realize it was a 1920's version.  Not quite what I wanted.  Will be more picky next time I pick a movie,",1391126400,,112,3.8260869565217392
1389752,5,B000053SNE,"For its age, it was good. More realistic than some and a little different twist on the historical story of Custer's last stand. It gave an interesting plot weaved around the historical part. Fairly good acting, trying to include all interested parties. I was grateful they used a few 'real' 'Indians'. Hollywood should always use real ones. More authentic that way and would have given some much needed income. (Maybe made up for some of America's mistakes - I say maybe.) More than just the men in the family will enjoy this program.",1336521600,3,534,4.752688172043011
