Just curious before I buy the movie, and info will be helpful. I did like the show, was not a fast action show, but to me, worth the watch. Thanks for your time.",1518134400,,366,4.169014084507042

7750988,2,B01FMROEJ8,"Good cast, decent plot, TERRIBLE directing.  When even Kevin Bacon isn't convincing, one has to look at the director.

7750997,3,B01FMROEJ8,"The Darkness is not a bad movie, it just lacks any real scares. It reminded me of scary stories for kids along the lines of Goosebumps!  So, if you are looking for a kid friendly spooky story, this may be a good choice. I can't remember any really bad language or adult content that would make it a bad choice, so you may want to consider it for family viewing. The same kid that played in the more adult oriented movie, Incarnate, plays in this one. Nothing in it that should give anyone nightmares. It just may prove banal for adult audiences. I rented it on Dish. But I don't feel compelled to own it.",1502409600,,604,4.252173913043478
7750998,4,B01FMROEJ8,"Pretty good spook story about an ancient Indian curse that is visited on a family of an autistic boy because he removed a sacred stone from its hidden resting place...nothing new really, but fairly well played. Kevin Bacon and Radha Mitchell are totally believable as a semi-dysfunctional couple dealing with the aforementioned boy with special needs, and a teenage girl who is spiraling out of control, played deliciously by Lucy Fry...pretty, figure obsessed,bulimic, and resentful about the attention her brother gets rather than her...what could possibly go wrong? What sets this above the pack is the measure the actors give their roles...they throw all in, but not over the top. Same with the side story drama...just enough to keep the nerves frayed, but not so much as to sink into a puddle of a pity party...The best attribute with this though, is the musical score...really well done...leads you on, them relaxes a bit, then WHAM...",1502064000,2,941,5.077419354838709

7751008,5,B01FMROEJ8,"This movie scared the living ? out of me, it's not levitating people off the floors that you see in possession movies but it does have a good plot and the 5 Anasazi Indian demons are quite scary

Plot

During a trip to the Grand Canyon while exploring Mikeys sister tells him to stay put while she goes to see something. Meanwhile Mikey drops a watch that had been given to him that day when he moves down to pick it up the ground caves in beneath him and he lands inside a cave. There he funds 5 stones laying on a huge rock with carvings on them he gathers them up and takes them home with him

Back home slowly Mikey begins to change at first subtly things get weird strange occurrences begin to take place it takes a turn for the worse and horror begins to take hold of the family. After talking to a family friend about the horrific experiences a healer is brought in to help and they face an epic battle of good vs evil

What I like is it slowly but not to slowly leads up to the big horror reveal and for a no blood and guts horror film it is well done and scary. The ending is excellent nice plot twist finale. Love Kevin Bacon",1490313600,,1135,4.076233183856503

7751010,2,B01FMROEJ8,"This is like an after school horror movie. Nothing scary at all. The acting was good, but its just not a good movie. I recommend going outside to make snow angels rather than watch this.",1489708800,,186,4.3428571428571425
7751011,3,B01FMROEJ8,"Wasn't a bad movie but I was expecting better by the writer's of the film.

7751013,4,B01FMROEJ8,"A supernatural force terrorizes a couple and their two children after the young son brings home some mysterious rocks from the Grand Canyon. Reading that description, it had my attention but I wondered how good can a horror movie be that's about a kid bringing home some rocks that are haunted? After watching it.....Wow, what a GREAT movie. If you like Horror movies that aren't all guts & gore & full of special effects then you might like The Darkness. I had my doubts at the start but after it was over, I was surprised I even liked it in the 1st place especially how much I liked it. I hope there's going to be a sequel with the same cast coming back like the Poltergeist movies. This movie was similar to Poltergeist so why not? Maybe the same cast, different story like they do American Horror Story? I watched it during the day while it was cloudy & drizzling outside but if I really wanted to scare the crap out of myself, I should've watched it at night. If you ever have a chance to watch The Darkness, I would most definitely say, Go For It",1487635200,,1052,4.345177664974619

7751015,3,B01FMROEJ8,"This isn't your typical horror movie.  Meaning that there isn't a body count, there aren't people being killed left and right, and there is no clear monster in this movie.  Sure there are the spirits but you can't point to one particular one that is doing anything.  Plus no one is really being hurt, everyone is just scared.

Also this isn't your typical perfect suburban family.  The son has autism, the daughter is a teenager dealing with anorexia, the wife has a drinking problem, and the husband seems to have had past issues with infidelity.  So in other words, they have their own problems and it makes things very difficult for them to function as a family.

There are a few good scares, and I will admit that at the end when you finally see these ""spirits"" that they do look creepy and their costumes do look pretty cool.  But where I didn't like the movie is that it had two problems that I saw.  The son is always talking about this ""Jenny"" person who is his invisible friend.  Who is she?  Is she really a figment of his imagination, or is she one of the evil spirits?  We never find out.  And second, why does the family not address the daughter's anorexia ever again after finding out about it?  They find out, she yells, they fight, the parents talk in the hallway and then that's it.  Seems they should have more of an interest in the daughter if she is doing this.

It's got some decent actors in it, like Kevin Bacon and Paul Reiser but they don't really bring their A game in this movie.  Their performances were just kind of phoned in.  Overall it's not a bad movie, but it's nothing spectacular.  If you like horror films you'll be entertained by it.",1486944000,,1671,4.419672131147541

7751023,5,B01FMROEJ8,I bought this as a gift for my sister and because I won't watch scary movies I have no review of my own. My sister did say that the ending was completely unpredictable and not what she thought was going to happen and it was very suspensful and kept her excited. She said she's already watched it 3 times in the past month. So if you're a fan of suspensful this should be a good one.,1485388800,2,382,4.0394736842105265

7751025,2,B01FMROEJ8,"Pretty disappointed with this movie. It was hyped up in a lot of youtube ads and I was excited to watch it, but ended up being pretty boring. I like the idea of the demons and how they're represented, but how they manifest is just too cliche.",1484784000,,242,4.170212765957447

7751027,4,B01FMROEJ8,"Personally, I enjoyed this movie.  Nothing revolutionary, but it's simply well-done.  Based upon real occult beliefs and an altered Anasazi mythology, the story grows tense and scary.  Great acting.  Especially by the autistic, possessed kid.  Creepy as hell.

If you want a solid poltergeist story, this is it.  The Darkness never gets corny or over-the-top.  Aside from its surprise dimension-shifting ending, the story is believable.",1484265600,,436,5.6

The cast introduction came off fairly vague and shallow and gives no real feeling about anyone. Then there is a time skip that goes unexplained, leaving a sense of confusion as to why things have seemingly escalated from nothing. This, along with the the extra cast that feels out of place and the disjointed ramp up of events, ruins the atmosphere of the film, ultimately leaving a feeling of dissatisfaction with the ending.

Though the movie starts out pretty strong, and the character acting especially from the actor playing a young autistic child, it was pretty believable which is difficult enough for an adult actor let alone a child actor.

Even Kevin Bacons acting was just ho-hum. And David Mazouz, who plays their young son with autism, seemed to forget he had it from time to time.

The reason I say its like Poltergeist is; Native American spirits are haunting a suburban house with them being really interested in the youngest child. There are bumps in the night, and the strange things start getting more intense and dangerous. Until finally they bring in a spiritualist in to cleanse the house, people go through a portal and face the evil, only to come out and all is good in their lives again. A couple of things are thrown in (bulimia and an old affair) to spice it up a bit. But it doesnt really. It just makes me question how these people can be that oblivious.

These evil spirits are supposed to be turning them against each other, and be making them go crazy. (We get to see this documentary type footage on the computer about four times.) But to me, they just seemed like a family who was horrible with communication, and that the adults really didn't want to be married to each other any more.

The only reason Im giving it two stars instead of one, is that some of the special effects were decent, and there are some jump scares that may get some people who watch it.",1474588800,,1411,4.44015444015444

7751141,5,B01FMROEJ8,"A vacation to the desert home of ancient Anasazi ruins has very unintended consequences for one family in The Darkness.  The family's autistic child Michael (David Mazouz), moments after wandering away from his older sister (Lucy Fry) and her friend, falls down a hole and into a previously undiscovered subterranean chamber.  Just minutes later, just as the boy's parents (Kevin Bacon and Radha Mitchell) are starting to realize he's missing, he comes wandering back into sight, apparantly unharmed and apparantly alone.  Appearances can be deceiving.

Once the family is back safely in their suburban home, strange occurences start happening - animals in the neighborhood becoming constantly agitated for no reason, strange terrible smells and an unexplained fire, for starters.  The boy's mother begins to think that something supernatural or otherworldly may be involved, although the father is skeptical.  But as the frequency and intensity of the manifestations increases, and as the mother's online research into her family's circumstances leads her back to the mysteries and beliefs of the Anasazi people who once inhabited the area her family recently visited, the family soon has little choice but to believe that something is indeed happening, and to try to find a way to combat it.

There is one aspect of the movie that may be seen as a plot hole.  I'm going to mark this as a possibler semi-spoiler.

***WARNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD***

After the Michael falls into, and thus opens up, the new underground chamber, that chamber is never mentioned again until close to the end of the movie, and there it's not in context of anybody else knowing it's been found.  One would think it would have gotten some news coverage or something.  Of course, it could have done just that and the family might never hear of it, except for the fact that the mother gets so into researching everything Anasazi as the movie goes on.  It might have been worth considering incorporating that particular underground chamber with some of the research the mother is doing.  Either that, or an angle could have been inserted that the spirits somehow led the child to find that particular ruin, and afterwards have used their influence to prevent its being rediscovered.  Either one of these explanations works well in paving over what's otherwise a slight bump in the movie's path.

***END OF SEMI-SPOILERS SECTION***

The Darkness is very well made and very well played by its cast.  Blumhouse, the production company, gets a fair deal of attention for how it produces so many movies (mostly horror, but a few others like The Gift) on consistently small budgets.  But what's really noteworthy to me is how they do it so well and so professionally they generally do it, including here in The Darkness.  Things like the cinemmatography, the camera angles chosen for various scenes, the visual use of light and shadows, the sound effects, and so on, are very high level in both The Darkness and other films the company's put out (Insidious, Sinister, Jessabelle, etc.) and I think deserve some serious credit.  (I only left the high-profile Paranormal Activity series off the list of examples because, as a found footage entity, things like camerawork and lighting are appropriately less polished, as makes sense in found footage movies)

At the end of the day, The Darkness occupies a position that many less well-known films, both horror and otherwise, find themselves in.  It's a great undiscovered gem that remains largely undiscovered mainly due to the fact that no one put fifty million dollars into a months-long marketing blitz.  Hopefully now that it's out on disc, where the playing field is at least a little more level, it'll start gathering a bit more of the attention that it deserves.",1474416000,,3795,5.044871794871795

This is first and foremost one of the better horror/suspense movies that have come out in a long time. The movie isn't necessarily the scariest movie I have ever seen, there were some tense parts but this was just a good movie overall. The movie had heart, tension that kept its grip on you, good acting and even a few surprises that made you stay interested and involved the entire time. The movie did have aspects of Poltergeist but really did feel fresh and new, which is rare for a horror movie. Overall, one of the better horror movies that have come out in a long time.

However, if you are into the blood and guts horror,you won't get it here. I enjoy both style horror movies,so it went well for me.

7751204,3,B01FMROEJ8,"Horror films rarely get the credit that they deserve. Ive discovered that the critics who review films seem to look down on the genre as lesser than their dramatic or action counterparts. Thats why the virtually unanimous negative reviews for The Darkness did not stop me from forming my own opinion. With the high profile names of actor Kevin Bacon and producer Jason Blum attached to the project, I was cautiously optimistic that the movie would defy the horrid critical reception.

The film follows a family who has just returned from a trip to the Grand Canyon. The family of four seems to be the picture perfect realization of the stereotypical American family. Behind that idyllic faade, each family member is facing a unique challenge. The father (Kevin Bacon) struggles to manage his infidelity as the mother (Rhada Mitchell) fights to keep her alcoholism at bay. Oldest child Stephanie is dealing with difficult body image issues that come with being a teenage, and the youngest child Mikey has severe autism that only compounds the issues of the rest of the Taylor family. As if that isn't bad enough, their domestic situation gets even worse when Mickey brings back relics from an ancient cavern at the canyon. This unleashes a spirit that threatens to destroy the family in ways they could never have imagined.

If the story sounds familiar, that is probably because The Darkness draws on every clich that youve seen in almost every other horror film. Every part of the story is predictable and trite. Even the intriguing family drama that is hinted at during the opening parts of the film are abandoned in favor of the mediocre conclusion that youll see coming from a mile away. The real shame is that the plot underwhelms an otherwise solid production. The film has an eerie tone that underscores the drama as the cast does everything in their power to work with what theyve been given. In the end, I cant help but to side with the critics. At a time when a trip to the movies has become more expensive than ever, The Darkness is a paint-by-numbers film that does little to earn our attention.",1465084800,3,2107,4.76986301369863
7751205,3,B01FMROEJ8,"Mikey (David Mazouz) is an autistic child who takes some sacred stones when he visits the Grand Canyon, like most of us do. (The ones in the souvenir shop are just so darn expensive.) When he gets home Mikey likes to play conjure the evil spirits with muddy hands. This causes family problems as their fears materialize. About an hour into the film we get the cliff notes explanation, realize Zelda Rubinstein has passed on, kids ruin your sex life, Lucy Fry has a barf collection, and Kevin Bacon is a horrible miscast. Everybody knows when you walk into the paranormal side, you tie a rope around your waist and one to this side...that way...oh never mind.

The film is extremely formula, except for the fact it didn't have aforesaid rope. It appears Radha Mitchell didn't get the e-mail to just phone it on as she proved to be the only convincing character in a ""Lifetime"" type of way. The movie had it classic jump scares, which weren't bad...just saying. I think they could have wrote the animal spirits into the script better and created CG effects for them. A crow sitting on a car...oooooh scary.

7751206,3,B01FMROEJ8,"Well, if you seen Poltergeist and almost every other horror movie with an upper middle class family made since, you've seen this, repeatedly.  There really isn't anything particularly new or inventive about this movie. It's not that it's badly done, it's just that it's been done many times .  This time the kid with a special communication link to the other side is autistic and he's brought ancient demons back from an Anastasi site.  Once again the family is astonishingly slow in reacting to things that would send the average family screaming and running away as quickly as possible. Once again some unusual people are eventually consulted to deal with the demons.  The main take away would seem to be never let your kids come back from strange places without thoroughly checking their bags, and if you see something, for God's sake, say something.

The actors are fine. Kevin Bacon and Radha Mitchell approach potential doom and destruction in a professional manner.  the film is directed professionally enough, but....  If you really want to see a well done and inventive approach to this story, go watch the original Poltergeist again.  you'll be much better off.",1463356800,2,1171,4.969230769230769
7751207,3,B01FMROEJ8,"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Darkness""

1. This is isn't the worst horror movie ever, but there's not much special about it. It's your basic paint-by-numbers haunted family flick.

2. The basic plot is the traditional tale of a family that goes on vacation. A kid takes something from a holy place. The things in the holy place follow the family home. The little boy starts talking to an invisible friend.

3. Besides the plot, the entire structure is just another remake of ""Poltergeist"": an upper-middle-class white suburban family hear things that go bump in the night. Then things go bump in the day. It seems to focus around the youngest kid. The family tries to stick together, while dark forces try to tear them apart. A small woman to comes and cleanse the house, etc.

4. The movie includes all the basic ingredients of the recipe: a creepy shower scene, a creepy bathtub scene, a scene where someone drinks orange juice in front of an open refrigerator door. Faucets turn themselves on, chandeliers swing, and doors close.

5. There are a couple of things that bring the movie (barely) above the line of mediocrity. First, the family is not your stereotypical loving family. This is a dysfunctional group of people. Mikey, the youngest, has autism, which puts pressure on the rest of the family. Mom is fighting alcoholism, Dad is fighting infidelity, and the daughter is fighting her own mental issues.

6. The acting and dialogue is better than I expected - there are some witty conversations, and the relationship problems between the parents are explored with more sophistication than you usually see in horror movies.

7. It has some real actors, which also raise the movie up a little bit. Kevin Bacon plays the dad, Peter. Paul Reiser plays Peter's boss. Radha Mitchell plays Bronny, the wife. You may remember her from the Silent Hill movies, ""Olympus Has Fallen"", and ""London Has Fallen"".

8. It was directed by Greg McLean. He did an awesome job directing ""Wolf Creek"". ""Wolf Creek 2"" wasn't as tight, but was still good, and ""Rogue"" was a fun creature feature. So this movie kind of feels like a step down for him.

9. If you need a horror film to watch, this one will do. It's not the worst movie of the year, but it's also not going to be all that memorable.",1463356800,34,2285,4.678304239401497
