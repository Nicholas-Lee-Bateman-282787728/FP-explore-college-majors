Distinctly political, the film still manages to be very moving at times, showing the inmates to have been victims of social conditions (although not thereby absolving  from their moral responsibilities).

A very young Zhao Wei (cover image) plays a lead part, and plays it well. But she is only one of several protagonists.

Image and sound quality is good, certainly for a film of that period.",1334880000,2,606,5.216494845360825
