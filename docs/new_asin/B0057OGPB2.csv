If you are a James May fan, the season is a great add to your collection. I mean come on, it's 150 minutes or so of Captain Slow being manly. Who wouldn't watch it?",1349049600,,368,4.054794520547945
4597578,4,B0057OGPB2,"The first season, at just three episodes, is short and rather slapshod in content. The program's still trying to find its way, and some segments just don't work all that well (the celebrity timed tasks for one). The saving grace is James May himself. If you're a May fan, you won't be disappointed by this show. If you're on the edge on buying this, wait for season two to arrive on DVD. I can promise you you'll fall in love with the show, then come back to buy this one wanting even more.",1340668800,9,490,4.279569892473118
4597579,4,B0057OGPB2,"This isn't as good as Top Gear at it's best, but isn't as bad as Top Gear at it's worst. In short James May is clever and entertaining but at times I miss Hammond and Clarkson giving him a hard time. The replay value won't be as high as Top Gear but you will occasionally revisit it. Might be better suited as a rental for some.",1339718400,,328,3.984848484848485
4597580,4,B0057OGPB2,"i've only seen the first couple of episodes, but so far, it has been both entertaining and interesting, if not exactly informative. chances are, i won't ever have to disarm a world war two era bomb..but, now i know how..the show ranges from the practical to the whimsy..with a really great view of british lifestyle thrown in...how to make a ""fish finger"" sandwich,..or how to build a pub in your garage..or a demonstration from a British army officer on the best way to shine boots..in one of the first episodes, the host, James May, gives tips to a would be suiter, on the best way to serenade a young lady.  In typical BBC fashion, they seem to do a lot of ""guerilla"" style fashion of setting up a shot and shooting on a london street, and don't edit out the bits when an English old lady elbows her way past and chastises the host..thats one of the things that adds charm and a bit of authenticity to the program...like when they enlist one of the big wig execs of the BBC, who happens to be on the set, to help hang wall paper, as none of them had done it before...it's like they think up things that would be interesting to them (producer, host, cameraman, production assistants..) and try it out in front of the camera..sometimes they enlist an expert on the subject, and other times they just read the instructions and wing it with a ""how hard can it be attitude""..and sometimes they find out sailing across the english channel without a compass is harder than it looks...fun, engaging, and entertaining, I will be ordering the first season on DVD, and sharing this program with friends",1329436800,10,1594,4.554006968641115

8461017,5,B0057OGPB2,"Not as amazing as the next two seasons, but pretty good for a first season of a show that's basically a bunch of men getting to make awesome stuff in their man cave!",1484870400,,165,4.03030303030303

8461021,5,B0057OGPB2,"If you watch Tom Gear and like Captain Slow you will enjoy this series.
A great set of 'lessons' for a man of the 21st Century.
I also purchased Man lab 2 same great material.",1389657600,,175,4.0285714285714285
8461022,3,B0057OGPB2,"James May is an accomplished and appealing presenter. Unfortunately, he's an amateur about technical issues generally, and messes up his designs, almost without exception. This is basically a Mythbusters where everyone has an IQ that's 20 points lower, and no one has experience in what they are doing. Worth watching? Yes. Educational? Instructive? Not a prayer.",1377216000,,363,5.5
8461023,5,B0057OGPB2,Man Lab will make you ask for more. A great blend of fact history science and comedy.  James we on the other side pond want more,1375228800,,128,3.923076923076923

8461025,3,B0057OGPB2,"I've watched (and enjoyed) all of James May's Man Lab episodes on youtube, so when I received the DVD of the first season of Man Lab I was excited, expecting behind the scenes stuff, bloopers, etc.  But no.  Not only do you not get any 'extra' stuff, the episodes are actually edited (shortened) from the UK version.  While I still enjoy the show's contents, it really detracts knowing there was stuff taken out that actually added to the episode.  Plus, all episodes have the end music theme cut out (it's a part where James May's original version of the theme, which he composed, is re-done by a group or individual with different instruments--a fun part of the show).  So, while the show itself is good, the DVD version is disappointing because of the edits.  Don't know if Mr. May had anything to do with it, but hopefully it will be corrected in season II version.",1352592000,24,869,4.574193548387097
