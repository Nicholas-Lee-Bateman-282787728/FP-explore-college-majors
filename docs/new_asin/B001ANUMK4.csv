8278256,4,B001ANUMK4,"The artists are incredibly talented and the music is great. There just a few things I would change if I could.
1. A DVD menu so you can go right to your favorite artist
2. Turn the microphone up. When the artists are singing, I can't hear what they're saying over the music.
3. Better quality video. The video looks like something you'd see at a high school play or something. Not from a professional studio.
Overall, this is a great buy for any bluegrass fan.",1238889600,,460,4.3604651162790695
8278257,4,B001ANUMK4,"This DVD veers off the bluegrass track most of the time. Stuart Duncan's work on here, though, is top-of-the-line, and that's mostly why I gave this four stars. I enjoyed some of Darol Anger's work, but thought a good portion sounded like grocery store music. (whatever that means, right?)
Sara Watkins can play the fiddle. However, on some of these songs, she almost didn't! I'm thinking of one song in particular, where she just pinches the fiddle strings between her fingers for an intro. and breathes, ""Sometimes I Love You Too Much"" again and again. I did enjoy her version (with Luke Bulla) of Hop High. Liz Carroll is a fine Celtic fiddler, and, just between her songs and Duncan's, this DVD is probably worth buying.",1230854400,,724,4.753968253968254
