8079106,1,B000ARSM30,"This is a terrible interpretation of a great ballet. If I had known how poor it was, I would never have purchased it. I had it converted
from the VHS tape to a DVD. What a waste of money!
The choreographer was trying to make it hip and modern which was a huge mistake with a classic ballet. Towards the beginning he has Daphnis fall to the floor and you can hear laughter from the audience. Later on, a dancer whizzes through a scene on a skateboard!! If you love this ballet as I do, do NOT buy this travesty of a ballet. I'm still looking for an acceptable version of this masterpiece but, alas, it seems that none exists.",1355184000,8,624,4.208333333333333
