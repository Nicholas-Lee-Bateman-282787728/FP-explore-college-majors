8273935,5,B0019FLR2U,"This is more of a documentary than a riding video, but it still shows a ton of riding. If you love Twitch or Metal Mulisha  you will love this movie.",1366156800,,149,3.966666666666667
8273936,5,B0019FLR2U,Dope movie with crazy tricks.  The flip in the air with no hands and the outdoor long jump... DOPE!  Also cool to show how we all gotta go through adversity in order to reach our goals and some things in our lives change like the weather!!!  Some of us don't make it through adversity but Twitch gets it in!  Dope flik!,1299542400,,319,4.180327868852459
