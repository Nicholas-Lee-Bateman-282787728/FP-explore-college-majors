4153641,5,B003LRQ0XK,Many thanks!,1414368000,,12,5.5
4153642,5,B003LRQ0XK,"Excellent choice. I must find more by this group. I especially liked Sampson's Handel songs and her version of ""I adore myself.""
I could listen to Handel all day.",1396396800,,162,4.620689655172414
4153643,2,B003LRQ0XK,"This disc is, in effect, the broadcast programme from the Proms as broadcast by the BBC but with an important modification.

The musical side of the issue is largely very good but with some major reservations as follows. There are four Coronation Anthems and these were all performed at this concert. However on the disc the second of the anthems can only be accessed as a `bonus'. Even worse, it is only available in stereo and the imaging is extremely poor. The drop in technical standard is startling and its relegation to 'bonus' status suggests that the producers realise that it is simply not good enough for the main program.

The organ concerto is performed in a very strange way indeed with hesitations and stops in the flow of the solo part which is totally disruptive in its effect. Why this is performed in this way is not explained but it sounds like a beginner who keeps losing their place and stopping before continuing. Perhaps this is supposed to suggest improvisation. It doesn't work. Other reviewers dislike this for the same reasons so beware.

Carolyn Sampson is so good as to be almost worth the price of the disc alone. Her `Myself I shall adore' aided with the prop of a hand mirror is unforgettably amusing and I am sure would have delighted Handel who was well known to have had a mischievous sense of humour.

Unfortunately all of the above comes with ebullient contributions from the announcer between every single item. This may be OK for a television broadcast but is insufferable for repeat viewing. Furthermore the sound level for this extreme level of enthusiasm is at a higher decibel level than the music as the announcer raises her voice to be heard over the audience in the hall. Surely this could have been relegated to that of a `bonus' feature? As it stands this is yet another disincentive for considering a purchase of this disc.

So in summary -  5 stars for Carolyn Sampson and 3 of the anthems, 2 stars for the concerto, no stars for the `bonus' 2nd anthem and, if it were possible, minus stars for imposed announcer commentary and awful recording quality of the bonus anthem. All my reservations are mentioned by other reviewers so not just a rogue review here. I would advise considerable caution before purchasing this disc.

This could have been so good. What a pity. This is a heavily compromised issue therefore, and in my opinion is not worth more than two stars. There are simply too many flaws in the production coupled with a questionable approach to the concerto.",1343001600,11,2520,4.713636363636364
4153644,5,B003LRQ0XK,"This is the most amazing organ music I have ever heard, it will touch every emotion within you. Handel`s music has always fascinated me and I find that every time I listen to something he wrote, it touches my soul in places no other music ever has. When I was studying music (piano) I learned to play the hallelujah chorus and during that time I began to love everything I could get my hands on done by Handel but this DVD is so well put together that I was truly amazed. The Organ Concerto in F major OP.4 No. 4 was brilliantly preformed Alastair Ross. I promise you this DVD will not disappoint you, if it does than it would be my thought that NOTHING would impress you.",1333756800,4,672,4.2578125
4153645,4,B003LRQ0XK,Uma boa miscelnia de obras do compositor Gregor Haendel! Apresentaes ao vivo transmitidas pela BBC Television com comentrios e anlise rpida das obras executadas. Um DVD bom para o preo cobrado.,1314316800,,193,5.258064516129032
4153646,4,B003LRQ0XK,"I love The Sixteen's performance. Fresh, detail, and precise! Carolyn Sampson, the soprano, is phenomenal. Her vocal quality and technics are superb, but what I enjoy most is her expression of the lyric. She is truly a great actress!

The only drawback is the organist Alastair Ross. To me, his improvisation is overdone and I can hardly catch up with his extreme tempo especially when he played the solo part.

The BBC production (both sound and image) is in excellent quality.",1300147200,4,478,4.888888888888889
4153647,4,B003LRQ0XK,"Yes, the previous reviewers are correct in that this Handel celebration has some very beautiful music done very well, and the sound recording is excellent.  Every prospective buyer needs to know, however, that the complete performance is ""ever-so British"" and consequently incomplete.  I'm sure that the selections suited the Prom Night, English audience; and perhaps that is why the director chose solo and choral works all in English including several coronation anthems.  Something major was missing, however.

Handel was one of the greatest composers of Italian opera, and he had them performed in England.  After too many years of neglect, more and more of his operas are being performed.  Some of his beautiful arias have become extremely popular. This director, however, chose not to include even one, single aria from any of Handel's beautiful Italian operas.

Understandably for this 2009 concert, the director was unable to present a Senesino to sing a few opera arias, but there are in modern times well trained countertenors who could have rounded out an otherwise limited presentation.  The ""Handel Celebration"" left a gaping hole in honouring the great Handel.",1296864000,16,1174,5.308108108108108
4153648,5,B003LRQ0XK,"A Handel Celebration, recorded 2009 in the BBC Proms at London's Royal Albert Hall, is a sheer delight. I must confess that I was not familiar with Harry Christophers and The Sixteen until now, but this is going to change. The recording is first-rate, both in terms of film and sound: the latter no small feat given the acoustics of this enormous venue. Period instruments and what might be considered period performance practice are used throughout the concert. The four Coronation Anthems are delivered with plenty of pomp and panache, but also with much nuance in the lyrical passages. Soprano Carolyn Sampson in her delightful solo pieces and organist Alastair Ross in the brilliant Organ Concerto in F Major are in splendid form. The singers and the orchestra musicians, all soloists in their own right, congenially respond to every direction of their conductor and could not be better. The presenters do a fine job in introducing the pieces, we even get a guided tour of the Hndel-Haus as it is being restored, and the refreshing bonus interview with Christophers is a valuable addition. This DVD is a winner in every respect at an unbelievable price. Get it and rejoice!",1279584000,42,1177,4.919597989949748

8399775,5,B003LRQ0XK,This program introduced me to a whole new aspect of Handel's work.  I found the works exciting and the technical aspects of the program -- video and sound quality to be excellent.  In prior Proms recordings I found the camera work to be intrusive -- however I thought the camera work was fine in this program.  I was not bothered by the commentary between numbers.,1472774400,,364,4.569230769230769
