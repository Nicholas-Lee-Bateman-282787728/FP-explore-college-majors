This DVD set has poor lighting so in some cases it is hard to see the back ground let alone the outline of equipment or those being interviewed. In some cases the voice of the commentator was out of sync with the descriptions of what was going on, much like a dubbed Japanese action film from the 70's.

I was looking forward to seeing the latest and greatest in military Gee Whiz equipment and this was a major let down, save your money and buy another product on the Amazon web site. Allot of the equipment has been a round for decades and there was no mention of equipment, development or new tactics that has been used in the Iraq or Afghanistan conflicts.

Overall the cinematography was poor and some one needs to learn how to use proper lighting, you only have to look at some o the Discovery channel DVD's to see the proper use of good camera angles and good use of lighting so you can actually see what the documentary is all about.

I have purchased many DVD's from Amazon and this is the first time I was very disappointed, this is in no was Amazon's fault. In fact I have found it to be one of the best if not the best in purchasing DVD's of great quality and content",1250985600,,1290,4.300411522633745
8449252,1,B000NOK0IK,"Disc 2 has audio/video synchronization problems.
Disc 5 has the whole section on the A-10 missing.

I emailed the company and asked for a refund or
to have the messed up discs replaced. No response
after 1/2 year. Don't buy this. Madacy Entertainment
is not any good. There are other products out there
that have better quality and customer service.

If it says Madacy on the package, put it back on the
shelf. One star is too good for this junk.",1245628800,,446,4.493827160493828
