8506487,5,B006YKW8WI,Great movie considering it was low budget. Very refreshing to see diversity in action in the movie--also had some campy parts that will bring smiles to your faces.,1514419200,,163,4.857142857142857
8506488,5,B006YKW8WI,"In ATTACK OF THE MOON ZOMBIES (2011), it's 1976, and we have a long-established lunar base. The Jackson Lunar Base to be exact. Run by the Administrator (Sid Korpi), life on the base is moondane, even moonotonous. Then, while the soon-retiring, Dr. Vincent Edwards (Michael Cook) is showing new recruit, Glen Hayes (Michael J. Kaiser) around, Hayes discovers an alien life-form! Said alien is a plant-like creature. Oh no! The alien blasts Hayes in the face w/ a strange dust! The poor devil drops like a sack of bananas! He's gone! Perhaps his autopsy will reveal clues to his death. What the...? Dear Lord! Hayes has risen from the dead! And, he's been transformed into some repulsive, pop-eyed, artichoke-headed moonstrocity! Annnd, it's on the move, changing others into... spore-spraying mooniacs! Can the survivors possibly find a way to defeat these moonsters, before they overrun the entire base? Will Dr. Collins (Douglas Sydney) and Dr. Hackett (Shannon McDonough) ever get the chance to marry? We live in hope. Director, Christopher R. Mihm has, once again, created an homage to / parody of 1950's sci-fi epics. With his on-purpose, cheddar sets, props, and costumes, Mihm spins his tale of cardboard and duct-tape. I love this stuff!...",1514160000,2,1248,5.122549019607843
8506489,5,B006YKW8WI,"Some purists may quibble at the monsters in this film being called zombies. By strict definition, zombies are traditionally animated by black magic. In the real world, of course, Haitian bokors would drug their victims with plant toxins that cause them to become easier to control - these unfortunates having given rise (no pun intended) to the legends about zombies. The monsters of this film are clearly a compromise between the fact and fiction of zombies, made all the more plausible, ironically enough, by the hard science-fiction elements in Christopher R. Mihm's script. Ignoring the controversy, all but the most conservative zombie mythology purists will find this film to be an enjoyable look into the far future and the terrors that await us all in our new lives on the moon!",1487462400,,786,5.00763358778626

8506492,5,B006YKW8WI,"""Attack of the Moon Zombies"" is the sixth low budget sci-fi tribute from Christopher R. Mihm, and it's my favorite of the bunch (so far anyway). This installment pits Dr. Edwards (Mihm fan favorite Mike Cook) and personnel at the Jackson Lunar Base against hilarious plant monsters. The film features very low production values and makes ""Far Out Space Nuts"" look realistic by comparison; supremely stilted dialogue, makeshift sets, and vicious foliage attacks set this epic apart from most other B-movies.

All these films are homages from Mihm to a genre he clearly loves (I do too): I don't think of them as spoofs per se, as they are too genuinely respectful to the underlying source material. The DVD has some great extras including an extremely long (maybe a bit too long) blooper reel, but nothing compares to watching the movie dubbed into Esperanto! I actually watched it twice, first in English and then in Esperanto and I'm not sure which gave me bigger laughs. There is also a choice of commentary tracks, during which all elements of low budget filmmaking are discussed in conversations more interesting than you might expect.

""Attack of the Moon Zombies"" will give B-movie addicts the fix they need, while also catering to cribbage enthusiasts young and old!",1436572800,4,1273,4.971830985915493
8506493,3,B006YKW8WI,"This gets three stars due to ""averaging""!  My 5 yr old grandson loved it (purchased for him since zombies are all the rage and I figured this would be harmless enough).  However, his parents wanted to poke their eyes out they said it was pure torture to set through it!",1421366400,2,269,4.36
8506494,4,B006YKW8WI,"This is an odd movie.  It all takes place inside a rocketship, but it was suspenseful right up to the end.  Part of its appeal is that the characters are all likable.  My favorite actor was the recurrant Michael Kaiser.",1408752000,2,219,4.425
8506495,5,B006YKW8WI,"These low budget remakes are refreshing and fun fun fun to watch.  Board to the point of snoring every time I see some high dollar computer generated ""cartoon"" of a movie... I just don't get it ~",1399161600,5,195,4.27027027027027
8506496,3,B006YKW8WI,"Much like any of Larry Blamire's films, or William Winckler's Frankenstein Vs. The Creature from Blood Cove, this is a fantastic send up to those great drive in films of the 50s and 60s. Recommended that you get to the snack bar before the picture starts, you won't want to miss it!",1346457600,4,282,4.4423076923076925
