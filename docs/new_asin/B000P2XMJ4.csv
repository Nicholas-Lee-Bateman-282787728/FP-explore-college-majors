2807984,5,B000P2XMJ4,"just as great as the 1,2,3 season. there is alot of wholesome,thoughtfulness and creativeness put into the seasons shows. it may be old but the writing was well thought out and fess parker and the gang out perform themselves as usual. I grew up on daniel boone and still enjoy watching. We should go back living that way again off the land.",1185926400,,340,4.5
2807985,5,B000P2XMJ4,"This was truly an entertaining show about frontier life with a nice ensemble of actors.  The one and only ""Fess Parker"", was truly the best choice for this role, like he was as Davy Crockett. The stories are interesting with plenty of action, and it makes you feel like you were actually living back in those times.

You won't go wrong in purchasing this series.

What a Boone, what a doer, what a dream come truer, was he!

2808015,5,B000P2XMJ4,Years ago our family enjoyed the TV series and now with fond memories we can enjoy it again.

2808016,5,B000P2XMJ4,We just love Fess Parker. The Daniel Boone series is great Family entertainment. You don't have to worry that there will be bad language or inappropriate material. It is full of excitement and suspense. I see that the Daniel Boone series has sky rocketed in price since we started to purchase them. We won't be able to buy more until the price comes down. We cannot afford to pay 200-400 or more in some cases for one season!! Why take advantage of people?,1361059200,,456,4.506024096385542

2808021,5,B000P2XMJ4,"I can't get enough of DB. I am finishing the 4th season and I love it. A lot of the episodes are not solely based at Boonesborough KY and I like that variety. There are a lot of special guests: Movie and TV stars which are also enjoyable. The quality of the scripts does vary from good to excellent. Unfortunately we do lose Mingo due to Ed Ames soaring as a voice recording star. Fess Parker said in the ""Bonus"" segments in the DB series that he very much missed working with Ed as Mingo and would have liked to have him finish the series with him, but that he fully understood why Ed Ames had to maximize his singing talent and the financial opportunity it brought. I believe that Ed Ames was and is unique in being as good an actor as he is a singer. You probably guessed right I love the Mingo episodes especially when he sings, WOW! I look forward to the remaining seasons which I now own. There will never be another DVD series collection like this that had a moral base of loving your neighbor as yourself and all the character that helped make American an exceptionally great country where a person's word was their bond regardless if it cost them or not. This entire series is great entertainment for families. I am looking for more older TV that I can get into having already done the original Hawaii 50 10 seasons, and all of Magnum PI. I hope that Warner Brothers digitizes ""Hawaiian Eye"" another great series as a predecessor to 50 and Magnum. If you would like to see ""Hawaiin Eye"" please search the TV titles for the same and chose to be notified when it becomes available. The more people like you do this the more leverage you give Amazon to get Warner Brothers to relase ""Hawaiian Eye"".  Aloha, Mahalo!
Hope this helps.

2808022,4,B000P2XMJ4,I like the Daniel Boone dvds. but not happy because disc # 4 in season 4 was blank. also I got murder she wrote for my Wife at Christmas and the cases where broken.and when I told you this you said you would send good cases to replace the broken ones. I know thangs get damaged but I would like disc 4 in season 4 replaced with a good one and the cases that I was told I would get for the murder she wrote purchuse. But all in all I will probably buy more from you I heve gotten several shows from ya and those are the only 2 problems I have had. thanks stephen Rhodes,1285459200,3,568,3.8632478632478633

2808046,3,B000P2XMJ4,"This season is not the best. There is no more Mingo, and Jimmy Dean well .... Let's just say he wasn't the best replacement for Mingo.  The show still is innocent but the plots have taken a downward turn. Most of them are pretty dumb.  So if you are looking for a G show this is a good pick, but if you're after a good show get season three or earlier.",1233014400,3,352,3.943661971830986

2808049,3,B000P2XMJ4,"I love this series!
However, while I give Seasons 2 and 3 Five Stars (Season 1 had not yet hit a stride), this Season (4) has some problems:

1) The writing just isn't as good as the previous 2 seasons. Too much Israel Boone, and too much of the same type of story with the British, and too many ""unbelievable"" situations. Sometimes Boone is made to look like a weakling while Israel saves his life! Give me a break.
2) The audio is out of sync on these episodes sometimes. Funny because on one of the Bonus Features they talk about how much care the put into cleaning up the audio and video. As someone in the industry I can tell you that there is no excuse for not having the audio sync up, it's just sloppiness. Someone did not do their job correctly and no one supervised to check and fix it.
3) Jemimah Boone just disappears with no explanation. No great loss, but kind of annoying when people just disappear.
4) Mingo is not in enough episodes.

#1 above is the MAIN problem, though - the others are just minor problems.

I would recommend this season only if you're a completist and want to have the entire collection. If you're only buying one or two sets, buy season 2 and season 3.

I don't know how Seasons after this are, I haven't seen them. Hopefully it does not go further downhill, but usually once a series begins to ""jump the shark"", there is no going back... And I'd say it jumped the shark in Season 4.",1204416000,20,1422,4.294776119402985
2808050,5,B000P2XMJ4,"With 4 children under the age of 9 and with the memory of Fess Parker as Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett still etched in my head from the 'golden years' growing up, I can tell you that my children loved every minute of the suspense of this movie (save for each of them biting their nails)!  The lessons and morals taught are invaluable and at such contrast to the mindless movies and programming children today are subjected to.  I met Fess Parker in person in 2/08 at his hotel in Santa Barabara and I assure you that he's still bigger than life at 6' 5"" tall, handsome and a with a great voice and a charitable disposition.  Buy his film legacy, they're not making any more of him (at least right now).",1204070400,6,703,4.3106060606060606
2808051,5,B000P2XMJ4,"This was a great series when I was a kid and now has become a great journey down memory lane. Liberation Entertainment has done a wonderful job of recreating this series. I didn't realize it as a kid, but with each season the acting the scenery and overall quality gets better. If you enjoyed this series as a kid, I know that you will enjoy watching them again. In my mind, Fess Parker will never grow old and the life lessons and morals come through with each episode that I watch. It's too bad that kids today do not have this quality of television entertainment. If they did, perhaps there would be less violence, crime and a better America! I would highly reccomend this to anyone.",1203292800,7,686,4.4523809523809526
