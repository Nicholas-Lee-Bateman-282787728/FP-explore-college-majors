8531683,5,B008X9M9Z4,Just like the show at Sea World. My son loves it! Would buy if you have ever seen the show or if you have not. Great for everyone,1394409600,2,129,3.642857142857143
8531684,1,B008X9M9Z4,"I wish I could rate this item higher, but I just can't.  Why?  I was under the impression that this was a brand new, never before seen DVD from SeaWorld.  When I got it and looked at the back, it looked remarkably like a DVD, called 'Celebrating Dolphins', I had purchased at the park a couple years ago.  In fact, it was exactly like that DVD.  When I realized that, I returned it and got a refund for it.  However, if you have never purchased the 'Celebrating Dolphins' DVD, then this DVD is for you.  If you do have the 'Celebrating Dolphins' DVD, then skip over this item and be happy with your 'Celebrating Dolphins' DVD.",1371081600,3,626,4.344827586206897
