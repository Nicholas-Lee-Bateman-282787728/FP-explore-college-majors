5004178,4,B006MEVCCS,"""Are we having a conversation or are you watching A Christmas Story?"" 6 years after Guantanemo Harold (Cho) and Kumar (Penn) are no longer the friends they used to be. On Christmas Eve Harold's in-laws stop by with their prized tree. When Kumar decides to surprise Harold with a present things go wrong fast. They duo now only have a few hours to find a new tree and get back home before the rest of the family. I have to admit that I thought the first one was funny and didn't like the second one that much. I didn't have high (get it?) expectations for this one going in. There are some movies like ""Inception"" that make you think. Movies like ""Margin Call"" cause a debate and make you feel strongly one way or the other. Then there are movies that you just watch, laugh and stay entertained all the way through. This is that type of movie. Nothing amazing or original but this is a funny movie that you can just watch and relax when you do. Overall, better then the second...and yes NPH is the best part of this one too. I give it a B.",1327622400,2,1038,4.247474747474747

5004182,4,B006MEVCCS,"I loved Harold and Kumar in 3d, i will order this movie on Blu-Ray as 3d.

But... everyone needs to know the movie studios have changed things.  gone are the digital copies compatible with itunes.  many of us have put lots of movies into our itunes on our computers, even shared on the home network so i can use on my apple tv's around the house and keep everyone happy.

Now enter Ultraviolet, the movie studios competition to itunes.  Which i understand Apple has a closed system.  Would it be terrible to get apple to finally open up?  Ultraviolet is closed also to stupid app's.  there are no compatible set top boxes or more.  and if you don't stream a movie within 3 years of authorizing it, you can't keep it.  Ultraviolet is a stupid system no where are capable as itunes.

do your own research....  Movie studios ought to offer a version of the movie just as a stripped down BD in HD and let people save the $ on the handicapped digital copy that is hard to use and limited in capability.",1325376000,10,997,4.358695652173913
5004183,5,B006MEVCCS,"This is a movie designed for 3D as things fly into the camera. The story line picks up 2 years later. Kumar (Kal Penn), the med student, isn't a doctor because he can't pass the drug test. Harold (John Cho) is rich and successful. He has a beautiful Latino wife (Paula Garcs) who has a lot of baggage, mainly Danny Trejo is her dad. Trejo's mom was killed by Asians. Harold and Kumar both have a new sidekick. We have a competition of sidekicks. Through a mishap involving a huge joint, Danny Trejo's 12 foot home grown Christmas tree gets burned down and now the foursome are on a quest for a new 12 foot tree in the heart of the city on Christmas eve. They carry with them an infant who seems to like illegal drugs.

On their quest they encounter Adrian (Amir Blumenfeld) the daughter of a crime boss desperate to lose her virginity; an evil clay-mation Frosty the Snowman; the Russian Mafia (who play Mafia Wars on-line); a Waffle-bot; the real Santa; and of course the resurrected Neil Patrick Harris.

The humor, while low-brow and crude works in this film because it adds some originality to it.

F-bomb, sex, heavy drug use, nudity [Cassie Keller,Chernise Yvette, Paula Garcs (butt)] 5 star low brow comedy",1325203200,41,1213,4.580645161290323
5004184,5,B006MEVCCS,"This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. It's dirty, raunchy, hilarious and will put you right in the Christmas mood. You don't need to re-watch the first two movies to understand this new one. They spoof the claymation genre as a tribute to the classic Christmas specials we grew up with. They give a dirty twist to that infamous scene from 'A Christmas Story'

Harold and Kumar aren't hanging out anymore and have new best friends with new lives. When Kumar receives a package meant for Harold, he takes it to him, and that's when the chaos begins. Throughout Christmas Eve night, they must find the perfect Christmas tree, deal with the Russian Mafia, befriend a robotic waffle-maker, and ride with Santa Claus in his sleigh. If you love dirty raunchy movies and Christmas movies, this is the perfect blend for you. I highly recommend A VERY HAROLD & KUMAR CHRISTMAS!!!",1324684800,57,881,4.720779220779221

5004228,3,B006MEVCCS,"Well, here's a review of the product - 3D quality of this movie and not the movie itself. A very ordinary 3D effect contrary to what some of the other reviews have mentioned. There are bunch of other 3D movies which are far superior than this in 3D effect. I am disappointed by my purchase of 3D bluray version of this movie as my purchase was mostly influenced by majority of the people praising about its 3D experience. There is a flatness overall in the picture (no sense of depth or immersion) with some occasional pop-outs that left no lasting effect at all. Also, the picture quality of this bluray release was nothing exceptional.
Just to mention, I have a very high end (flagship standard) Plasma 65 inch 3D TV and have dozens of other (Real) 3D exceptional quality movies which have thrilled me again and again. This one I would probably not care to watch again (alone for its less impressive 3D effect).",1471392000,4,913,4.573170731707317

5004252,5,B006MEVCCS,"Okay, here I go....

For the record, up until today I have never seen a Harold
& Kumar movie -- nor had I ever had the wish to do so.
And, since I'm being totally honest with all of you, when
this screener arrived at my front door it would have been
impossible not to hear my loud sigh of disgust knowing
that I would have to subject myself to reviewing this film.
As I shamefully slipped this Blu-ray disc into my player,
I couldn't help but think I was about to take one for the team.

Some 90 minutes later, I find myself the happiest viewer
on Earth.  I'm not quite sure what just happened, but having
just watched A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas, I feel
as if I have had one of the most outrageously fun, enjoyable
3D experiences ever!  One should never, ever judge a Blu-ray
by its cover nor hate Harold and Kumar just because they like
dining at White Castle.

I hope you will excuse the fact that I have no prior knowledge of
the adventures of Harold & Kumar prior to this third installment
of the film series as I attempt to describe where the story picks up.
It seems that some years have gone by since Harold (John Cho)
and Kumar (Kal Penn) have seen each other.  While Kumar remains
the stoner that I would assume he has always been, Harold has
gotten his life together and settled down in a very expensive part
of the suburbs alongside his gorgeous Latino wife (Paula Garcs).

Things turn from bad to worse when Kumar is accidentally sent
a package addressed to Harold.  Upon delivering that package
to Harold's home, he manages to burn down a sacred Christmas
tree belonging to Harolds father-in-law (Danny Trejo).  With only
hours before Christmas the duo springs into action to find a
replacement for the burnt fir as they become entangled with
Ukranian mobsters, experience a Claymation hallucination, and
find themselves in the middle of a Rockettes musical number
headed up by Neil Patrick Harris -- who I have gained an immense
amount of respect for after watching his performance here.

Folks, let me tell you, I still cannot believe how much I enjoyed
watching this film.  A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas sinks
to the lowest bowels of humor and rises up as one of the raunchiest,
funniest and most graphically crude R-rated films I ever have had
the pleasure of watching.

And, really, if you don't plan to watch this film in 3D, you are going
to miss the ride.  The filmmakers don't hesitate for a moment in
letting the audience know that this is a 3D film.  They don't just
throw everything they can at the audience --- the slow it down and
splatter it up to the point that there is no mistake that you have just
been slapped in the face with an effect.  Be prepared to be assaulted
with eggs, splattered with blood, blitzed with traffic barrels, and
overcome by smoke and dancing embers emitted from a giant joint.
The CG effect work in this film has shifted into hyperdrive for the
sake of keeping its audience completely immersed in the 3D experience.
Even when the action slows down a bit, I still found myself very
much entertained by falling flakes of snow or thrown confetti that
came within inches of my face.  Of course, there is one show-stopper
moment here that I will not ruin.  Let's just say it takes place during
the Claymation sequence and it will have everyone in the room
howling hysterically with disbelief.

If there is any criticism that I could give to the film would be the
fact that I wish there was a little more perception of depth.
Fortunately, this is just a personal preference for me that may
not matter to most of you. I prefer my 3D films to have that pop-up
book look.  You notice that very effect during the film's various
flashback sequences, but outside of those moments, I felt that
depth levels were not as deep as I would have personally wished.
Be it as it may, I will not let my personal preferences get in the
way of giving this Blu-ray disc presentation a perfect score.

You will be very happy to know that crosstalk/ghosting is at
absolute minimal here.  This is important for the many effects that
project themselves outward to be convincing.  I only noticed
a single instance of double-imaging when the Ukranian mob boss
points a gun after the contents of a closet are revealed.

None of the highly-pleasing 3D visuals I described above would
be possible if not for the film's immaculate transfer.  Image quality is
superbly detailed, blacks are excellent, colors are vividly beautiful
and skin tones look naturalistic.  Since the entire film has a Christmas
theme to it, I was delighted to see how well all the colors of the season
have been perfectly translated through this transfer.

The 5.1 DTS-HD soundtrack creates an immersive soundfield that's
completely engrossing for the viewer.  The fronts provide a dynamically
rich sonic experience -- particularly in the film's musical sequences that
are supported with robust low-end LFE support.  The rears do a terrific
job of ensuring that thrown effects buzz across the viewer's head before
crashing or exploding behind them.  It's such a delight to have a film
that immerses the viewer equally in sound as it does in visuals.  Yet
another reason why I found this to be the perfect three-dimensional
experience.

A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas arrives as a 2-disc Blu-Ray
3D + Blu-ray + DVD + Ultraviolet Digital Copy set housed in lenticular
packaging.  While the package is being promoted as the extended
""Extra Dope Edition,"" the extended cut only exists on the 2D Blu-ray
disc. The Blu-ray 3D, DVD and Digital Copy versions only contain the
theatrical cut.  The 3D Blu-ray contains a 2D trailer for the animated
Justice League Doom.  Sadly, the Blu-ray contains a promo for
Warner 3D Blu-ray, filled with what would amount to great demo
material if only it had produced it in 3D rather than making it a standard
2D promotion for those who still haven't bought into the format.

The 2D Blu-ray contains the extended cut as well as two featurettes:
Through the Haze With Tom Lennon, and Bringing Harold & Kumar
Claymation to Life.  Deleted Scenes are also included.

I introduce no embellishment when I say that A Very Harold &
Kumar 3D Christmas is the 3D film that you have been waiting
for.  When all other filmmakers are making 3D films that play it
too safe, this is the kind of movie that isn't afraid to let it all hang
out -- and trust me, it does.

Of course, it would be very irresponsible of me not to note that
this is one of the raunchiest R-rated films ever made.  You
certainly don't want your kids watching this no matter how cute
you may think these characters are.  What this film best serves
its purpose for is being the perfect party staple for your most
uninhibited of friends. Go ahead and invite them over, have a couple
beers, smoke a bone (if that's your thing), and sit back back and
have the time of your life.

If ever there was a reason to invest in 3D, this Blu-ray is it.",1453075200,2,6939,4.567393058918483

5004274,3,B006MEVCCS,"I really liked this film.  It is not as strong as the first in the series, but a definite improvement over the second film.  However, I am disappointed there was no marijuana montage like in the prior two films.

Harold/John Cho is very successful, staid, and married, and he is no longer friends with Kumar/Kal Penn, who flunked out of medical school because of a positive urine test.  Vanessa/Danneel Harris makes a minimal appearance, and though she was a bright presence in the second film, her scene lacked spark.  I love Harold and Maria/Paula Garcs together; they have a naturalness smoother than chemistry.

The star is definitely Neil Patrick Harris, who continues his hilarious turn as a warped version of himself.  His scenes were audacious, clearly he was given the best lines, and he was a magnetic, very charming presence.

I wish there was more of Andy/Eddie Kaye Thomas and Seth/David Krumholtz.

5004299,4,B006MEVCCS,"Roldy and Kumar are back, 6 years later, when the estranged pair are reunited by accident one Christmas Eve and set forth on a quest to replace a very important Christmas tree from Harold's home. See, Harold's very intimidating father-in-law, played by Danny Trejo, has brought over a very special tree for their Christmas celebration, and after promising it will be fully decorated and ready by the time his wife and in-laws return from Christmas Eve mass, a visit from Kumar results in the tree accidentally being burned to the ground. This naturally leads them into one of their usual, disaster and drug fueled adventures in an attempt to replace it. As expected, the pair encounters a very wild, obnoxious, and womanizing Neil Patrick Harris, their old friends Rosenberg and Goldstein, and a lot of really, really trippy stuff, including the real Santa Claus! There's also a robot that makes waffles!

If you didn't read that thoroughly and think this sounds like a great, new, family-friendly Christmas flick, maybe you don't know that Harold and Kumar are... sorta their generation's answer to Cheech and Chong. This is an adult comedy with lots of adult jokes for us adults. If you liked Bad Santa, give this one a watch. If you like the other two Harold and Kumar movies, give this one a watch. Harold and Kumar movies are funny stuff IF you are not easily offended. This one goes pretty far by making very light of a baby getting hooked on drugs, Jesus with topless angels on each arm, and someone getting their member frozen to a pole like the kid in ""A Christmas Story"". If you think that stuff might be funny to you, you might love this movie. If it even slightly offends you, move on. Sometimes, I'm not sure how I feel about some of that stuff. I know it's just a joke an just a movie, but man, nobody cares at all that this little baby is using crack... Oh well. It's only a movie, ha.

As for the quality of the overall experience, it's a funny movie. It might not be as funny as the other two. Thing is, I haven't seen the other two for a while. I still need to get them. I think it might have been a bit less laugh-out-loud funny, but it's still funny and it does have another angle. It's a Christmas movie, and somehow, even when Christmas movies are not as good as regular movies, the Christmas aspect bumps them up a little bit. It's not Bad Santa hilarious, but it's funny still, and it has some particularly great moments. The NPH stuff is always particularly good in these flicks, and this one is no exception. Also, dang, this movies has babes galore. From Harold and Kumar's ladies to a girl NPH tries to take advantage of and one crazy hot, virginal mobster's daughter. One of the big things about this film though, one of the huge selling points and probably something that hurts the film if you don't see it in that way, is the 3D aspect. This film is one that was made thoroughly with 3D in mind. Many jokes rely on the 3D aspect of the film, and this means that when you don't have a 3D TV and don't have the 3D version, you aren't taking in the movie the way it was intended. Still enjoyable, but a lot of things are not having the intended affect. I still recommend this one if you love Christmas movies and that includes raunchy, offensive ones, but I put forth that warning and recommend it much more highly if you own a 3D TV (just make sure to get the 3D version of the Blu-Ray.

As for bonus features, the film comes with a few deleted scenes, and that's it. They're fun scenes, but not including them was a good choice, I think. As it is, I agree with one reviewer's comment about how a slight change to who saved the day in the end might have made for a better ending, but it's still fine and dandy as it is. Will Kumar leave his real-life white-house jobs to make another of these films though? That's a good question. Considering how this film deals with the two characters ""growing up"" and becoming family men and all, it seems unlikely, but ya never know. A writer can make a sequel to anything. Heck a good enough writer can make a great sequel to anything, even if that happens less often than not. So, yeah, you just never know, but this one works fine as an end to the series, so either way, I'm good and I enjoyed this one too.",1420329600,,4276,4.396464646464646

5004340,5,B006MEVCCS,"A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas (2011). Rated ""R"". Running time: One hour, 29 mins. Widescreen.
Directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson.  Written by Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg.
The third and last movie in the series.

It is always nice to see Harold & Kumar again. It's like a Bob Hope - Bing Crosby movie to me, but I have never seen Bob & Bing smoke a bong. Maybe they did smoke in the Road To...films.
  If you are a fan of the first movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-amp-Kumar-Go-to-White-Castle-Extreme-Unrated-Edition/dp/B00068WOH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (Extreme Unrated Edition)</a>&nbsp;(2004) and the direct sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-and-Kumar-Escape-from-Guantanamo-Bay-Unrated/dp/B001DDSTJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (Unrated)</a>&nbsp;(2008), you will like A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas (2011).

Returning: John Cho, Kal Penn, Eddie Kaye Thomas, David Krumholtz, Paula Graces, Bobby Lee, Neil Patrick Harris, Danneel Ackles.

The story takes place six years after the second movie.
Harold (John Cho) is married to Maria (Paula Garces). He has a domesticated business job and owns his own house.  He is expecting Maria's father (Danny Trejo) to come for Christmas Eve.
 Kumar flunked out of medical school. He is upset over the break up of his girlfriend, Vanessa (Danneel Ackles). Kumar has grown out a mustache and beard and his apartment is a mess, just like a bachelor. Kumar is so down all he does now is smoke weed.
  He gets a package for Harold who he hasn't seen in 2 years. Kumar decides to go visit Harold on Christmas Eve to give him the package.  (I missed this part. I went to the bathroom, Mr. Pibb you know).
  Kumar has his new best friend(?), Adrian (Amir Blumenfeld), drive him to Harold's address. A very nice home. Kumar has his doubts about being there, so he just puts the package on the porch.  Harold opens the front door and is perplexed to see Kumar after so much time has passed. Kumar is alright after slipping on the icy walk. Kumar thinks he better go back to the car, but Harold invites him in.
A mishap happens with Harold's Christmas tree and Harold is mad at Kumar again.  The tree was special because it was grown by Maria's father for years.
  Harold must find the same kind of tree before 2:00am.
All this leads to a new late-night adventure for Harold & Kumar.

Also in the cast: Patton Oswalt, Bobby Lee, Elias Koteas, Jake M. Johnson, Richard Riehle.

This is NOT a movie for children.  It is movie for adults.
  It contains foul language, use of drug paraphernalia and drug use, sexual situations, male penises.

Option of language and subtitles: English, French, Spanish, Portugues.
No audio commentary.

Filmed in Detroit, Michigan and New York City, New York.

In-film advertising: White Castle.

The 3D effect can only be seen on the movie theater 3D screens with reaL D)) 3D glasses and it works well with the smoke-out-of-the-mouth effect and snowflakes and other ""things"" I can't mention.

Nice to see Rosenberg (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Goldstein (David Krumholtz) return. With so many Jewish actors in this movie, for balance, David Krumholtz does make an uncircumcised joke.

As raunchy as this movie was, I don't see how it can be played on television with the editing they would have to do.  It might be short like a Charlie Chan movie.

This movie had bad writing and some uninteresting characters. It was a nice idea to have a Christmas story with Harold & Kumar. Some scenes were hilarious.
  The movie only being 89 minutes made me feel short-sheeted.

John Cho does play ""Sulu"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-2009-HD/dp/B009CF3P7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek (2009) [HD</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Into-Darkness-HD/dp/B00E5Q1HJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek Into Darkness [HD</a>] (2013) and Star Trek Beyond (2016).

Jon Hurwitz has said they have plenty of ideas when it comes to the Harold & Kumar franchise.

 A Harold & Kumar animated pilot had been worked on in 2014 for a possible tv series. It never found a network for broadcast.
  Hope they make a Harold and Kumar 4 movie in the near future.",1403740800,,4419,5.491851851851852

I also got a kick out of the toddler inadvertently getting high.

Kumar finds out his long time girlfriend is pregnant but is still an irresponsible pothead and that created a rift in their friendship. They are brought together by an anonymous gift that turns out to be a fat joint.

5004352,3,B006MEVCCS,"These movies just keep getting better and better. It's not that the story is any less ridiculous or raunchy, it's that the actors have gain experience. When the series started, both John Cho and Kal Penn were virtual newcomers, but now they've been in some big films and TV shows. The pair are much better actors than they were in the first film and are better equipped to pull off the ridiculousness. In their third film, Harold and Kumar have actually been estranged for a while. When a mysterious package shows up for Harold at Kumar's apartment, the two are brought back together and are forced to work together to solve a problem. Everything you saw in the first two films and everything you've come to love about Harold & Kumar are back, including THE Neil Patrick Harris. There aren't many surprises here, by now you basically know what you're going to get with these films. What is new, is the Director, Todd Strauss, who actually does add a few interesting things to the film. Harold and Kumar is a lot of laughs, in a ridiculous story, filled with drugs, breasts, and alcohol. If you didn't like the first two films, you won't like this one any better, but for what it's worth, I dare you to watch it and tell me you didn't laugh out loud at least once.",1389139200,,1263,4.495652173913044
5004353,3,B006MEVCCS,"Since most Christmas movies are so terrible, this one one being even remotely good rockets it up to the top of the ""best x-mas films"" list. The current reigning champ is Bad Santa.

This particular installment of the Harold and Kumar series takes place over an entire day just before Christmas. After Harold and Kumars last adventure, Escape from Guantanamo Bay, it seems the duo had become estranged. Since then Harold has grown-up, given up the stoner life, and become a respectable citizen. Then, out of nowhere the good ol Kumar shows up and burns down Harolds Christmas tree with a massive joint. Harold desperately needs a new tree, but finding one is not as easy a task as it sounds. Their adventure begins.

What ensues during the quest to find this tree is either comic genius or just utter crap. I propose it is solid mix. First, there is a toddler that gets high on at least three types of drugs. Then Harold and Kumar themselves get drugged, drugged into a random claymation sequence in fact where they are almost killed by an Abominable Snowman. Then, they almost get killed again, this time by some gangsters.

Thanks to the veritable array of ethnicities in the film there are some hilarious race jokes that come across nicely, but the highlight of the film must be when Harold and Kumar have a run in with Americas Sweetheart Neil Patrick Harris. Yes! The Neil Patrick Harris. This is his third appearance in the Harold and Kumar franchise, and also weirdest because in Guantanamo Bay, Harris was killed with a shot gun by hookers.

Errata: Post-credits in Guantanamo Bay NPH is shown getting up off the lawn having survived multiple shot gun wounds to the back. No mention of NPR's miraculous survival is made when the trio are reunited in the Christmas film.

5004354,5,B006MEVCCS,"I really enjoyed the stereoscopic direction and editing in this movie. The 3D in this blu ray is fantastic IMO...and I watch a great deal of 3D vids. What I really liked was how the 3D varied from scene to scene in depth. Instead of applying the same formula to every scene, the 3D was used like a drug. THere 3D was not very deep on average scenes, but on scenes that were dynamic the 3D was used to make the movie really come to life and entertain.

The comedy was not predictable. As usual there was a lot of sexual potty comedy and a few scenes I didn't felt were funny, but that's just me.

This is one of the few movies that combine 3D and humor, so it's worth 5 stars just for being so unique. If you like 3D and don't mind crude humor, this a great movie to have in your collection.",1388188800,,790,4.0576923076923075

Not for G rated family consumption though so you've been warned. The best thing going for it is this story has heart.

I saw this in 2D before I purchased the 3D version and you will still get the 3D gags in 2D because they are so obvious but seeing them in 3D is icing on the cake.

5004410,3,B006MEVCCS,"A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas(released Nov/11)stars John Cho as Harold Lee,Kal Penn as Kumar Patel,Neil Patrick Harris as ""Neil Patrick Harris"",Danny Trejo as Mr. Perez and many others. Everyone's favourite dysfunctional duo are back,and this time they're taking on Christmas. Nothing is sacred here as Santa,the Catholic religion,Neil Patrick's gender question,some off colour humour with some naughty parts exposed,and their usual fun with pot smoking are all topics for the comedy fodder machine. It's not your usual Christmas movie,but it's something a little different and off the wall,which will please most if not all H&K fans everywhere.
The story here finds that Harold and Kumar have not been talking for at least two years. Harold has a really good paying job and is married to a Hispanic girl. Kumar on the other hand is still bonged out and out of a job. His girlfriend of old has come by to tell him she is pregnant with his child but he is so out of it that she leaves in disgust. Harold meanwhile had his wife's relatives arriving for Christmas. The father is intimidating Danny Trejo,whose face looks like the dark side of the moon. Seems the father in law has brought his own Christmas tree and takes Harold's away,to Harold's chagrin.
What brings the two disparate plots,and guys,together is a package that comes to Kumar's place by mistake,that he delivers to his old friends house. Harold invites him inside,but Harold's pops- in-law's tree catches fire and is tossed through the front window. Harold is beside himself and Kumar leaves. Harold reserves a tree at a local lot,the last one left,and goes to get it. In the meantime Kumar has by happenstance seen said tree at the lot,and feeling sorry for his old buddy he stops and bribes the seller with triple the price and off he goes with it back to Harold's. But Harold just arrives after Kumar leaves and when asked where the tree is,the seller points to a speeding van. In the ensuing chase,the van flips over several times. Kumar is alright but the tree is gone forever when the van explodes.
The scene shifts to a party going on in an apartment across town where there is a tree available that Harold's friend said(lying)that he could have. Turns out the girl who is hosting the party is the daughter of a local Russian mobster,who comes home in not too good a state of mind. Everyone leaves and Kumar and Harold are suddenly on the guys hit list. They escape for the time being and seek out Neil P.Harris who is putting on a Christmas show in New York. They end up in his chorus line and hiding in his change room. They eventually are exposed,with Neil pretending he knew they were there all the time. It turns out the show has trees Neil is willing to give to the guys.
But this isn't to be as the two get kidnapped by the Russian mobster's gunmen. They manage to escape and standing outside they fire a shotgun into the air. It accidentally hits a passing Santa,who falls to Earth. As he lies there bleeding Kumar performs surgery on him and patches him up. Kumar returns to his ex girls home,apologizing for his behaviour and said he will even give up pot and return to his medical studies,for the chance to marry her. Harold returns home to find an anxious father in law awaiting his return. When questioned about the missing tree Harold tells him in no uncertain terms who he is and what he won't stand for any more. The father immediately comes around and he is now welcomed into his wife's family. The next morning a tree magically appears courtesy of Santa and Kumar and Harold are reunited again at Harold's Christmas party.
Along with all the aforementioned issues that H&K make fun of,there is always an undercurrent of love and respect between these two friends. If that wasn't there these movies wouldn't work. There are,as always,plenty of sight gags,some in good taste,others not. This is NOT a movie anyone under 18 years of age should be watching. Sometimes also the plot threads that connect one incident to another are so threadbare as to be see through,but you pardon those moments because you know these characters will either turn things around or screw up even more. This film was originally in 3D and the makers have obvious fun putting in,not subtle,but deliberate moments for the 3D film goers.
Technically speaking this film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a couple of additional scenes.
All in all,the fans of the H&K franchise should not be disappointed when they view this newest entry. It contains all the irreverent humour they have come to expect from a H&K film and with just that much more of their fun filled antics. The film is not Academy Award material,but it's not trying to be. Just have fun with it. Recommended.",1358380800,2,4770,4.700119474313023

Three days after I got a text that said out for delivery, should arrive today. I got a little slip in my mail box saying that I had to come to the post office and pick it up myself.

5004423,4,B006MEVCCS,"A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas follows the title characters as they search for the perfect Christmas tree on Christmas Eve; throughout their adventure, they encounter plenty of drugs, a notorious gangster and his henchmen, Santa Claus, NPH, and much more. Although it's not as great as the first two films, A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas is a fun, raunchy Christmas comedy with some great moments. I also enjoyed the Holiday-theme and tones, which are complimented by the great Christmas soundtrack and vibrant colors; it really has the potential to become a holiday tradition, at least for myself. I also enjoyed the claymation segment. Although I enjoyed it, I didn't find the same ""spark"" the first two had, and it just simply isn't as memorable; it took more than one viewing to really appreciate it.

I purchased the ""A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas (Blu Ray) [Blu-ray]"" which came with the Blu-Ray, DVD, and Ultraviolet copy for $9.99. The version I received came with a Blu-ray disc and a separate DVD disc, despite what the description may state. The quality was great, as expected.

Overall, I recommend A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas for fans of comedy and the series, and even people looking to expand their Holiday collections (although I don't recommend watching with children). I enjoyed it, and it grows on me the more I watch it.

This film has strong blood and violence, full male and female nudity and sex, and drug use.",1354752000,2,1447,4.850202429149798

Kal Penn and John Cho seem to be going through the motions as if they've outgrown this type of juvenalia.  This is not to suggest that they're phoning it in but they don't seem to have the same energy level as they did in the previous installments.

5004448,5,B006MEVCCS,"Highly offensive garbage comedy.  That defines A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas.  And guess what?  I eat it up every time!  I just like the constant swearing, sexual references, immaturity, and overall raunchiness that the film series has been known for.

In this one Neil Patrick Harris returns (better known as Doogie Howser, at least growing up in the early 90's that's what *I'll* always associate him as) and he continues and finishes the curious story that left off from the other Harold & Kumar movie where he entered the naughty girl house and got his you-know-what on, lol.  I was wondering what happened with that!

It's about Harold & Kumar going on their own little adventure around the city streets late at night around Christmas time (perhaps Christmas Eve) in search of a replacement Christmas tree that accidentally gets burned down during a freak incident involving a joint that blows (back) through the living room window and lands on the tree branches.

Highlights include the game of beer pong with a bratty and annoying kid, the claymation segment when Harold & Humor become high and lose touch with their surroundings, the waffle making robot that can apparently communicate with humans and bail them out of dangerous situations, the weenie stuck to a pole scene, the baby girl that sniffs too much marijuana and cocaine and changes into a mega baby, and several other segments all jam-packed into one 80-minute film.

I higly enjoyed it and you probably will too.  Just remember, kids should most certainly NOT watch this movie.  Too many jokes pertaining to extreme sex acts and heavy drugs that are entirely too inappropriate for the younger crowd (anyone under the age of 18).",1345852800,2,1701,4.9125874125874125

I haven't seen the first 2 Harold & Kumar movies, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this one.  I laughed my butt off, and the 3D effects were plentiful.  I'm always bummed when a 3D movie only offers added depth but no pop-out effects.  This flick has both.  If you're looking to add another 3D movie to your collection, I think you'll be happy with this one (unless you don't like like raunchy, politically incorrect humor and nudity in your movies).",1345248000,9,555,4.51
5004450,5,B006MEVCCS,"Harold and Kumar,the consumate kings of conundrum, take us on a non stop holiday sleigh ride through one hilarious situation to another.  The movie starts out slow...but once it picks up the side-splitting snowballing rollercoaster experience doesn't let up until the end.

Neil Patrick Harris makes a dazzling Holiday extravaganza appearance filled with an amped up salacious appetite only he could pull off.  While his screen time is limited, in each of the Harold and Kumar movies, his performances are so well acted and over the top, you find yourself looking forward to his appearance.

We see the anticipated mature level headed Harold, as the movie begins, settled into a monogamous relationship living with his soon to be wife.  The ideal life, tastefully decorated upper middle class house, a peaceful existance over all.  Suddenly all is turned upside down when Harold's soon to be in-laws, (I lost count after 10), headed by future father in-law Danny Trejo invade the couples house to stay and celebrate the holiday on Christmas Eve.  The soon to be father in-law insists on one tradition...A live Christmas tree, (which he himself provides), this sounds simple enough (no spoiler alert here)..remember this is a Harold and Kumar movie.

As for Kumar, as the movie opens he is almost unrecogizable, (seriously I didn't think it was the same actor), his life seems to have turned into nothing but weed and the eternal search for it.  He and Harold are estranged at this point... but destiny has other plans for these two.

A true jewel in the crown of the Harold and Kumar trilogy.",1344729600,3,1592,4.951127819548872

For those that never seen these movies it's got a lot of drug reference and raunchy humor.  So if you like those kind of movies watch it if not don't.  It was insteresting to see where these characters have come to grow up to even though they end up in some crazy situations that are far-fatched.

5004452,1,B006MEVCCS,"This movie was pretty stupid, filled with dumb video effects and no clear theme. Everyone in it thought they were funny with stupid lines that did nothing but make the movie boring. There were no straight people in it to make Harold & Kumar look funny. Everyone had dumb lines. They broke the carnal rules of comedy. I kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't.

I should have read more of the negative reviews and believed them. This movie is nothing like the first two. Those were humorous because of Harold and Kumar and the good dialog between them. They were the best movies in resent years almost as good as Cheech & Chong. The only good thing is I bought a used Blu-ray copy for $8",1339632000,,694,4.338461538461538
5004453,1,B006MEVCCS,"Wow. I mean, just wow. I must be honest and say it's hard to be objective about a film when the subject matter is racist, vulgar and loud. As usual, Harold & Kumar endure a night of mishaps in order accomplish their mission, which in this case is to replace the Christmas tree that was inadvertently destroyed in a strange (hint: it has to do with weed) fire incident.

There were plenty of opportunities for 3d to shine - smoke, snowflakes, eggs, debris, and a huge Christmas spectacular starring none other than Neil Patrick Harris. Sadly, I can't speak for the technical aspects of these as I only viewed it in 2d.

As for the material, it's not like I've never laughed at jokes about bodily functions before, and hey, who doesn't enjoy scantily clad babes. (That's more of a comment, not really a question.) SPOILET ALERT, SPOILER ALERT!!! But I just couldn't find the humor when it came to the scenes of  a 3 year old gets high on cocaine. Now I'm no hypocrite, I laughed my ass off when I first read Ivan Brunetti's `Crack Babies' comic strip back a few years but watching the concept applied to an actual live person is a different experience. Some people may find the notion itself offensive, yet it occurred to me that the presentation was most alarming. The whole reason the joke exists is to poke fun at the over-anxious dad who apparently spends every waking moment distressed over the safety & future of his child, only to have her exposed to such damaging events through no fault of his own and despite his best efforts at shielding her from the ugliness of the world. Funny, right? Hmmm, not so much.

Bottom line:  The first H&K installment was a cleverly written, hysterical movie but the second one was so-so. I finished this 3rd installment with a sense that the filmmakers confused their attempt at making it `better' than the rest by infusing it with more daring material without being more selective in the process or with any regard to the main protagonist's identities. Hardcore H&K fans won't care about deciphering where the satire & parody ends and cruel intentions begin but the rest of us will be left wondering. I definitely recommend renting it first if you're on the fence.",1339545600,2,2205,4.643589743589744

Their jokes were racist to every group out there not just one and thats what made these movies great as they played on every race and sex stereotypes instead of attacking just one group. Now this does not offend me but may offend others.

The Third movie ended up branching off completely different, I suppose thats why it had no direct connection to the past movies like they did for one another. It takes place in the future opposed to 15 minutes into the future. A poorly written film that lacked jokes and laughter. The adventure was nothing compared to the other two.

Don't expect this to be the same as the last two movies and even if you haven't seen those it still won't be a great movie.",1338854400,2,772,4.429577464788732

 What a very 'streetsmart' movie. Gutterville for me. If you like movies filled with colorful languarge, anotomically correct body parts and graphic drug use in extremely over exaggerated situations - this ones for you. Continueing the story from the previous two films - Harold (Play by Star Trek (2009) John Cho) and Kumar (Played by Kal Penn (How I saved My Mother))...as they drifted apart and are brought together by a Christmas Tree. Harolds wife's family is coming for Christmas and the 7 year old 12 foot fern, grown in Mexico, is burned down.

Mission - get a tree by 2 AMChristmas Eve. Not gonna happen - because of Cocain, Pot and Extascy. For me the funnies moments were with Neil Patrick Harris. He dominates the comedy. He sin gs, dances and even has scenes with his real life husband (David Burtka) play a Gay Couple, Playing Straight, Playing a gay couple. Neil is hysterical! That's aboutt he best thing this movie has in the form of comedy. Oh, there is a father and a small child that get's high, smokes cocain and then does extascy...and lives!

Oh, and did I mention Harold shoots Santa Clause? Technically - The 3D side of the film was incredible. They completely took advantage of the 3D - even breaking the 4th wall. Overall - just a medeocre romp...but lots of visuals that either will shock you - or make you laugh out loud.  I liked it...some may not. Crass humor may not be some peoples cup'o'tea!",1336003200,,1474,4.614503816793893

The first two films were pure, carefree stoner comedies, while the 3rd was more like a coming-of-age tale in which the heroes often question their goofy, juvenile behavior and reflect on the possibility of becoming responsible family men. If the H & K franchise is going to bring such mawkish and shopworn concepts into the series, then this better be the final chapter. Amusingly irreverent movies such as Harold & Kumar's are better off leaving out the preachy life lesson of social conformity. As for the primary storyline, H and K accidentally destroy a one-of-a-kind christmas tree belonging to Harold's father inlaw. The duo sets out to find a replica before Harold's wife and inlaws get home.

1. A lesbian shower scene with young, naked, sexy nuns?

2. A little kid getting high on cocaine and developing super powers?

3. Santa accidentally getting shot in the head with a high-powered shotgun?

4. Santa giving marijuana as a Christmas gift?

5. Scantily clad women (some topless) in Heaven?

6. Santa inhaling deeply from a bong?

7. A two-foot tall robot designed for making waffles, beating up Russian gangsters?

With the exception of A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas, I don't think there has EVER been a Christmas movie that has all of these things!  In the entire history of movie making, it would appear that A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas is unique.

The good news, however, is that much of the same fun and spirit of Harold & Kumar is back for their Christmas Special!

5004527,5,B006MEVCCS,"I'm a huge fan of the first two Harold and Kumar movies. Completely irreverent and absurd, the series has been a benchmark for R-rated, slapstick comedy during the past decade. Although this third installment wasn't quite as amusing as the previous two entries, that's only because the first two were so utterly hilarious. Number Three is still outstanding, and a fantastic show for fans of the series!

A couple of my favorite parts of this movie were the Wafflebot (ridiculous and ingenious), Danny Trejo wearing classically ugly Christmas sweaters (never thought I would see such a thing), and the resurrection of Neil Patrick Harris, after clearly being blown to smithereens in ""Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay"". Oh, and how could I forget (Spoiler Alert?)... Harold shooting Santa Claus in the head with a 12 gauge shotgun. Yup, that happens!

This movie will be going on the shelf right next to Billy Bob's ""Bad Santa"", in my favorite holiday movie collection. I really hope this movie does well enough to warrant another performance by this magnificent duo.",1331510400,,1076,5.03932584269663

The performances that both actors gave was pretty bland, almost like they didn't even care about the movie they were making.  The only good parts of this movie were Danny Trejo and Neil Patrick Harris.  They actually TRIED to give good performances and they seemed to actually give a rip about this movie.  Every other actor just phoned in their performances.

Plus did I really need to see Kumar's penis in clamation?  And on top of that did I really need to see Harold's penis stuck to a metal pole?

I really hope this is the last one of these movies that Hollywood makes.  Seriously, what are they gonna call the next one, ""Harold and Kumar: Still Milking It?""

Harold and Kumar return for some wacky adventures, this time to try to find a Christmas tree to replace the one they destroy.

Is it any good?

Uh, did you read what it's about? This has to be the flimsiest story idea I have ever heard. How could this idea have been green lighted?  Secondly, the comedy is completely forced. There are moments of a slight chuckle, but that's it. Thirdly, Neil Patrick Harris (from How You Met Your Mother) is featured on the cover, right in the middle, so you would think he would have a bigger part right? Wrong. 10 mins max, towards the end of the film, which is completely stupid and unnecessary. Fourthly, it completely wastes the time and talents of Danny Trejo (from Machete) and Elitas Kotias (from The Thin Red Line). Fifthly, it goes for ONLY 80 minutes!  Oh, wait that's probably a good thing.

Best bit?

Seeing hard nut Danny Trejo wearing a knitted teddy bear sweater. Yep, that's the best bit.

Kal Penn and John Cho have a super cute ""bro-mance"" thing going on and their comedic timing is always very good.  I think their movies stand out (for me) literally because of what they look like:  two Asian-American lead male actors in a mainstream movie where one is not karate chopping someone and the other is not plotting to suicide bomb a building.  How often do you see that?  I never see it... and that in and of itself makes this very typical ""stoner"" movie more charming (yes, that's a stretch - lol) than most.

Many will find the excessive raunch in the Harold and Kumar films distasteful ... and it is!  Still, if you want a cheap laugh and can appreciate the fact that the two lead characters are not your typical White suburban or Black urban kids/young adults then I think you will get something out of A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas.

There's a whole storyline of a toddler getting inadvertently high on several drugs, which I thought was humorless, not a prude, just don't think a child getting drugs is funny. This movie would have gotten 3 stars from me as overall enjoyable but a little heavy on the friendship monologues. The 4th Star however goes to Neil Patrick Harris! He was only in the movie for 10 minutes but I laughed the hardest when he was on screen. His on-screen persona of a guy who's a slimeball pretending to be gay is still hilarious.

Earlier on, Amazon had posted that it the Blu-ray/DVD set would be a two-disc set with one disc for the Blu-ray and another for the DVD. Then, for the 3D Blu-ray/regular Blu-ray/DVD set, there would be three discs. But shortly before it came out, I found out that both went down one disc because Warner Bros. decided to go cheap and make a two-sided disc, with the Blu-ray on one side and the DVD on the other.

It's been my experience that those type of discs are not only defective much of the time, but they're also easy to scratch no matter how good you take care of them. I've bought them brand new and found scuff marks and even scratches right upon opening them for the first time.

Warner Bros. has made me, a very big Harold & Kumar fan, very disappointed... so much so, that, as much as I hate it, I'm going to have to skip on purchasing this movie.

Why couldn't they just release the extended version on a single Blu-ray, without the DVD version? They released single-disc versions for the regular, theatrical cut. But if I want the ""Extra Dope Cut"" I need to put up with a two-sided disc?

Never understood why I need to purchase every disc medium that's available when all I want is the 3D movie. So I often wonder... is the cost of the 3D titles high because it's 3d, or because they include 3-4 discs in each offering? Stop. I don't want them.

The movie is fun and for a short good laugh that can be viewed over and over with friends this is a must buy for anyone that has a 3D TV. I am not sure why they would even release a 2D version b/c the movie really plays on the pop out 3D in most of it's jokes so watching it in 2D is pretty pointless. The only thing that is bad about the blu ray combo is that the longer version of the film is only on the 2D copy. Not sure why they did that but I am sure it is b/c the studio did not want to spend money converting it to 3D for the 4 or 5 extra minutes the film is in the longer version .

I get very irritated toward reviews that rate a film based on the 2d viewing in the 3d product reviews. Seriously this movie is a prime example of how the 3d Can be used in a way to improve the experience a great deal. In 2d I no doubt would have been less impressed and rated it with a 3--4 start rating.

There are so many things that are so wrong with this movie that it just gets outrageous. The 3d technology used to make this movie is top botch and they used it to a great degree. I am not going to go on a reveal spoilers but take my advice, watch the 3d version on a good display ... Projection like a Optoma HD33 if ya got one ...

You see this often nowadays with HD Video and Audio ""  The way it was intended to be viewed or heard..This is the case with this movie and its 3d.. Unlike many movies where the 3d is just an added bonus, this movie was built around the 3d concept and not just 3d tacked on post production.. This movie is the new king od 3d in my eyes.. that opinion might change when my free copy of AVATAR arrives and I view it..but until then this reigns supreme...

A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas finds our titular tokers as somewhat estranged friends, Harold having stopped smoking marijuana since getting married and Kumar having let himself go after his girlfriend dumped him. Harold, however, has promised a perfect Christmas to Mr. Perez, his father-in-law, and when Kumar accidentally burns down Mr. Perez's tree, he and Harold are again caught up in wild hijinks. Not quite hitting the highs of the first installment but certainly besting the second, Christmas offers more raunchy, irreverent laughs, and though it's still a bit hit-or-miss, I enjoyed seeing the pair's sweeter sides.",1328572800,2,926,5.18
5004573,2,B006MEVCCS,Suit. Office. Suburb. Unfunny friend. Desire to have babies all around. Faux redemption at end. TV-caliber CGI. The toddler-on-ecstasy scene is gutless.,1328572800,2,152,5.954545454545454
5004574,1,B006MEVCCS,"One two-sided disc with dvd on one side and blu-ray on the other. So, when the kids take it to watch in the car you won't be watching it in the home theater, esp after they lose or scratch the crap out of it!",1328572800,8,208,3.75
5004575,1,B006MEVCCS,"I really enjoyed this movie, and yes it is as mature as the previous Harold and Kumar tales.  But, I have to say I will not purchase this combo, because the UltraViolet digital copy only works with the Flixster streaming service.  I have not been able to get Flixster nor the downloads to work for any movie that I have purchased with this UV service.  If you love the movie and don't care about the digital copy, then buy it...but, if you love using didgtal copy with iTunes or Windows Media Player, then you are out of luck!",1328313600,11,526,4.346938775510204
8500692,1,B006MEVCCS,"I was waiting for this to go from buy only to digital rental as I'd seen the other Harold & Kumar films.  It finally went to rental and I watched it.  Only to remember that I actually HAD seen it when it came out...and it was so bad I must have promptly forgot about it.  Even NPH can't save this one.  If you enjoyed the other H&K films, skip this one.  It's terrible.

There are a few entertaining scenes and the film may have worked if it just went from skit to skit without trying to stretch them together into a film length feature.  As it is, I just found myself getting annoying at pretty much all the characters and the writer.  I can't really say what it was about.  I watched it a few weeks ago and apparently, it was so bad I've already forgotten about it again.",1528243200,,773,4.134228187919463
8500693,3,B006MEVCCS,"Kinda funny. Disappointing 3D. (LG OLED65E6P) If a stoner saying, ""Oh my god dude, you just shot Santa Claus!"" makes you roll on the floor laughing, this is the movie for you. I smiled a bit, but never laughed out loud. 3D seems flat throughout. A few nice popout effects, but with all the amazing 3D offerings that take your breath away now available on blu ray, this one is lackluster. Fun diversion, but won't watch again.",1526083200,,425,4.532467532467533
