8189902,5,B000P8RJ92,"I actually own the German edition of Muzzy (the newer re-released DVD set), and if the Spanish version is anything like the German, then it is probably nothing short of amazing.

At first I was a little skeptical showing this to my 18 month old (who is now over 2); I didn't know how he would react -what if he didn't like it? But, the exact opposite happened. He sat through the entire first DVD, and still sits through the entire thing, since the first time he watched it (which is an amazing feat in itself for a 2 year old). The DVDs are entirely in German, there are no subtitles (unless you program them in), and no one to interpret what the words mean. Children (and parents like me) learn the language the way we all learned English. There is an instructional book, though, if you don't like being left in the dark.

My son now sings along to the songs in German, and knows some of the rudimentary basics of the language. I also picked up the basics, just from watching with him from time to time. There are six lessons and a language DVD, which he will be starting soon. I cannot recommend this product enough. Absolutely amazing!

If you are looking to buy the entire collection, it is a little pricey (around $[...]), but if you buy directly from Early Advantage, you can make payments. They offer German, Spanish, Chinese, French, and Italian.",1171152000,5,1355,4.477732793522267
