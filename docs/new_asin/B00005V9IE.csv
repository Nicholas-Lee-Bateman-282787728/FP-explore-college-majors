7956151,5,B00005V9IE,"Touch Me is an absolutely beautiful movie. It has love, romance, and heartache like any good movie could ask for...only this story is totally different from most.

Brigitte (Amanda Peet) is an aspiring actress/aerobics instructor. She works at a health club run by Adam (Michael Vartan). She has a bit of a crush on him, but is afraid to act on it because he has a reputation as a 'playboy'. One day, though, he kisses her and that's where they both find what true love is.

Unfortunately, the next day, Brigitte finds out that an ex-lover is dying of AIDS and may have infected her. She waits until after her ex has died and after she's caught Adam with his ex before she gets tested.

When she discovers that she is HIV-positive, her whole world turns upside down. Her roommate Margot (Kari Wuhrer) moves out. Former friends are unable to look at her straight without getting panicky over possibly catching the disease. Her only constant is Adam, who is so lovesick for her that you want her to just get over that she caught him with his ex and kiss him right there. Adam refuses to leave her for very long at a time because he's realized that the sun rises and sets with her for him.

Of course, they meet many more difficulties along the way, but...overall, it's an amazing movie. I would suggest that you view it with tissues by your side. It has some VERY sad moments in it. Definitely a must!",1379808000,,1399,4.474509803921569
7956152,4,B00005V9IE,Sensitive and way ahead of its time this movie stars Amanda Peet before she was all that and it's pretty damn good. Director Gordon Boos brings humanity to the story.,1378512000,,166,4.566666666666666
7956153,3,B00005V9IE,Touch Me was interesting as well as educational. It educates people about protecting themselves against HIV/AIDS. I recommend it for couples dating.,1251676800,,148,5.7727272727272725
7956154,5,B00005V9IE,Excellant choice- great and touching movie also love the main actor. Don't see many regarding AIDS.Recommend watching.,1243900800,,118,6.0
7956155,4,B00005V9IE,"When I read the outline of this movie I frankly thought it would be depressing and only decided to watch because of the two stars.  However, once the plotline got going it became a truly gripping story that had me glued to my seat waiting for the ""happy ending"" that seemed impossible half way through.  For those hopelessly romantics out there - this is the movie for you!  (Michael Vartan isn't to bad on the eyes either!)  Enjoy!!",1044748800,7,433,4.512820512820513
7956156,5,B00005V9IE,"I think many viewers have avoided this film because they know HIV is in the plotline.  We are used to movies about HIV and AIDS being movies about death and dying.  However, this movie deals with HIV present day where one can be leading a life and be kept in fairly good health with the right medical care.  The issues this person faces are entirely different from those faced back when HIV and AIDS hit the planet decades ago.

Chief among those issues is whether one can have a love life, a romance, a career or children if one has been infected with HIV.  This movie grapples with all these issues in a romance between the characters played by the wonderfully charismatic duo of Amanda Peet and Michael Vartan. This film is NOT a downer in any sense of the word.  It remains utterly faithful to the romance genre and you will love it every step of the way if you love the genre.  Women will adore Vartan as a leading man and men will adore Peet as the leading lady.  You can't lose.

7956158,5,B00005V9IE,"Touch me is one of those films that you turn to on a rainy day you sit watch it and become so drawn in by it that before you know it, its all over! It is the story of Bridgette an aerobics instructor/actress who is just looking for her big break to come. She meets Adam, a playboy just looking for his next conquest, one day at the club. He is the manager of the club but they have never gone out because Bridgette never fell for his so-called charm. One day she gives in, and they begin a whirlwind romance and soon Bridgette finds out she has AIDS, which she got from a former boyfriend. Will she tell Adam? How will she deal with the news? I won't give the rest away but I will instead say how great this film is, and I reccommend purchasing it for anyone who likes a good love story!",1015977600,2,787,4.051282051282051
