8071770,5,B000A0LALS,"One of many, many noir films produced during this era, The Pay Off is a lot darker and more on the edge than most. As another unusual twist the main character is a reporter and not a private eye.

This gives the production much less of the cookie cutter feel that you find in a lot of the mid level noir films and makes the ending more s urprising and less predictible than many similar films.

There are no big stars, which enhances the uniquness of this production.",1146614400,12,467,4.295454545454546
