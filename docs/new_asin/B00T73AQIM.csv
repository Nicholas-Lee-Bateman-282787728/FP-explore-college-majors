7002500,4,B00T73AQIM,Great movie!!,1435449600,,13,6.0
7002501,3,B00T73AQIM,"Shout/Scream Factory brings us another double feature to please those aficionados of the drive in once more. This time around we get one of those really schlocky bad movies coupled with one that offers better than I expected. No matter what the opinions of the movies are though, these are items that drive in fans will want to have on hand for those backyard movie night during the summer months when the beer flows freely and the interests in the movies runs low.

EMPIRE OF THE ANTS comes to us from producer Bert I. Gordon whose FOOD OF THE GODS took us down a similar path. Here we have the story of a corrupt land developer taking a group of possible investors to an island that is intended to be an up and coming resort. Unknown to them is the fact that toxic chemicals were dumped in the area and washed up on shore, altering the ants of the island into huge bugs the size of a Cadillac.

As the group tries to escape from the encroaching barrage of ants they get picked off one by one. The ragtag group that remains finds themselves being corralled where the ants want them to go and are nearly eaten alive when they find help in the form of the local sheriff. Too bad that he and the rest of the townspeople on shore have been coerced by the ants via mind altering pheromones that control them. Only these few remaining folks have the mental ability to rescue them all.

While some have discussed the amazing effects done with little (I think zero) budget, I found them to be distracting at best. Composite shots of blown up footage of ants set beside shots of actors wielding boat oars don't match at all with the line between the two images blurred and outrageously visible. Alongside these problems are giant fur covered ant heads used when we see a victim being ripped apart or eaten by the ants. Unbelievable is the easiest word to convey what they look like. And yet there is a certain amount of charm to be found in this low budget world of effects with some decent acting by stars who had seen better days before signing on for this movie. Fans and those pleasantly intoxicated will have a great time with this one.

On the other hand JAWS OF SATAN offers a decent movie that fell into the 70s genre of man against nature and corrupt town officials ripped off directly from JAWS and inserted into so many films. Here we have a demon in the form of a giant snake that escapes from a carnival train intent on wreaking havoc in a town where the local priest, Father Tom Farrow (Fritz Weaver), is a descendant of a line of religious leaders who have subdued the demon/snake for centuries.

Bodies begin showing up with alarming amounts of snake venom in the bites theyve suffered. At first the town medical examiner agrees with a local doctor (Gretchen Corbett) that these are snake bites to be alarmed about. But with holiday events on the calendar and business owners fearful of losing money, he quickly changes his mind with the help of the towns mayor.

A herpetologist called in from a nearby university agrees with the town doctor as to the cause of these deaths but that doesnt persuade the mayor to cancel any and all activities. As the doctor, the herpetologist and the priest begin to compare notes and causes they begin to realize how to handle the situation which comes to a dramatic conclusion in the cave where the snake finally dwells.

Sure this is a JAWS rip off but that doesnt matter. Those moments when it becomes blatantly obvious are funny to see and may leave you laughing. The effects work for the snakes is serviceable, the acting is above what is usually found in a movie like this and the camera work is impressive, but then again nearly everything cinematographer Dean Cundey touches looks great. The end result is a movie that plays far better than you would expect.

As always the extras and quality of the final product live up to the Shout/Scream Factory standards and fans will be more than happy to have these on hand in this edition as opposed to some half thought out bootleg copy taken from a poor VHS tape stored away in someones attic. Face it folks, these movies may not be Shakespeare but they do offer some fun times and some fun memories of drive in days gone by. What more could you ask for?",1433894400,4,4249,4.48062015503876

7002503,2,B00T73AQIM,"i'm a big fan of the AIP films during the 70's
Empire of the Ants being one of them, the Food of the Gods being the other, aswell as Count Yorga vampire
which is still waiting for a blu-ray release if it ever gets one

alot of Great acting Performances in Empire of the Ants
Joan collins, Pamela susan shoop, Jacquelline scott, Robert Lansing and others
alot Great special visual effects aswell with the Mutated ants done by Bert Gordon himself
a Great suspense thriller written & Directed by Bert Gordon
this new HD transfer in 1:85:1 ratio given by Scream factory does look excellent, nice sharp & clear picture quality
much better quality than the very old dvd version
i cannot say the same for the sound quality thou, it's terrible mono sound shocking sound
what an insult. i definitely expected more effort with the sound quality a new 5.1 master audio mix would've been much better quality
but obviously SF did not bother to improve the sound quality, looks like they just focused on cleaning up the picture quality
with regards to the new extras for the Empire of the Ants
well only a new Audio commentary has been recorded with Director Bert Gordon
i'm sorry but this new commentary does seem pointless to listen to
either Bert is not interested or he's having a hard time remembering making the film
he does not sound enthusiastic talking about the film at all
so what does that tell you, a commentary not worth listening to
tragically no new interviews with Joan collins, Pamela shoop or even Director Bert Gordon
which i think would've been better to have a retrospective featurette with Joan collins or Bert Gordon
instead of boring commentary
I'm not impressed with this blu-ray version i'm insulted
JAWS OF SATAN is the other movie on this 1 Disc blu-ray
the exact same HD transfer has been given for Jaws of satan as Empire of the ants
which means the sound quality is no different either
and no new extras either.
the only thing worthwhile about this new blu-ray is the new HD transfers that's all
the sound quality for both films is terrible really terrible quality,
this blu-ray is only worth $5 or less if you pay more than that for this your being ripped off
4 stars for the film, maybe 2-3 stars for this new blu-ray version",1433203200,5,2245,4.58457711442786
8700709,4,B00T73AQIM,Two very cheesy 80's Sci Fi/horror movies.  Empire of the Ants is the best of the two IMHO liked it back in the day and well I still like it today campy as all get go but a good movie.  Jaws of Satan never heard of it and well I can see why this movie is bad and not in a good way.

8700711,4,B00T73AQIM,"Scream Factory combines 1977's ""Empire of the Ants"" and 1981's ""Jaws of Satan"" together for this blu-ray double feature release. ""Empire of the Ants"" was director Bert I. Gordon's followup to his 1976 cult hit ""The Food of the Gods"". It features the same cheesy but fun mix of filmmaking tricks which tried to make audiences of the era believe that people were being attacked by giant ants. It is a lot of creature feature fun than fans of the genre should have a blast watching.

""Jaws of Satan"" from 1981 on the other hand features a small town in Alabama beseiged upon by snakes controlled by Satan himself. While it has some moments of cheesy nuttiness, overall I found it to be rather boring. It is possibly more well known for featuring famed cinematographer Dean Cundey on the crew and a young Christina Applegate in the cast rather than anything else.

Both films share a dual layer blu-ray.

""Empire of the Ants"" is presented in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio while utilizing an existing HD master from MGM's vault which looks quite nice overall. Detail is much improved over prior DVD releases. Colors, contrast and black levels look good as well throughout. Despite not featuring a new HD scan the film looks great to my eyes.

""Jaws of Satan"" on the other hand gets a brand new HD transfer and looks fantastic as a result. Presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio, detail is exemplary and grain levels look natural with no digital scrubbing apparent. Colors really pop and black levels are inky with no crush that I could see. While not a great film in my opinion, fans will be floored by how great this new blu-ray transfer looks.

Both films are presented in 1 channel master audio and sound quite good. The only extra included for either film is a director commentary track on ""Empire of the Ants"".

While ""Jaws of Satan"" almost put me to sleep on my initial viewing, I do feel it could improve with subsequent viewings. ""Empire of the Ants"" though is a treat from start to finish. Overall this is another excellent double feature from Scream Factory.",1488844800,4,2062,4.6510989010989015
8700712,4,B00T73AQIM,"Double feature Blu-ray from Scream Factory is another strange pairing, though ""Jaws Of Satan""(first time on home video) does contain an excellent HD transfer(though the only extra is the differently titled theatrical trailer called ""King Cobra!), and ""Empire Of The Ants"" has more extras like a commentary track.",1450137600,,312,5.520833333333333

8700714,1,B00T73AQIM,"My Review of JAWS OF SATAN:  This film really makes me wonder how corporate executives operate. Why in the world would they give Bob Claver, a director of mostly sitcoms on TV, the directorial reins of what is his only theatrical feature? The closest thing Claver came to to directing horror on TV is two episodes of THE DUKES OF HAZZARD (1979), four episodes of THE MUNSTERS TODAY (1988 - 1989) and 62 episodes of the mostly forgotton sci-fi sitcom OUT OF THIS WORLD (1987 - 1991). I'm not kidding. This R-Rated atrocity is to horror as asking Jerry Mathers to play ""The Beaver"" in an adult parody of his classic 50's & 60's TV series. I consider this the anti-horror horror film and once United Artist and MGM (who still owns it) executives looked at the final product, they knew they had a stinker of the highest order on their hands (just the name itself plays off the 1975 Steven Spielberg classic and THE FINAL CONFLICT, the second sequel to THE OMEN franchise, which was released the same year, and the plot does resemble JAWS a lot [a giant creature terrorizing a town just before a big opening], while using quotes from the Bible to play-up the supernatural angle), but since they already had posters printed up for this turkey, they gave it a minimum regional theatrical release in the United States and dumped it on to foreign territories under the name KING COBRA (the title the print on this Blu-Ray actually bears) before giving it a limited VHS release through Wood Knapp. Then Christina Applegate became a bankable star (she appears in this film when she was ten years old and spends approximately 5 minutes on screen, maximum) and MGM re-released it in 1998, but people still knew a 20 year-old turkey smelled like fish on ice no matter what year it was made and the release was quickly abandoned. What it did do was attract the usual vultures from eBay and Amazon sellers, who were selling VHS & DVD-R boots of this film for outrageous prices, not bothering to tell the buyers that they would smell the delivery in the mail coming a few days before it reached their mailbox. Heck, it never even had an official DVD release in the U.S., so that should tell you something right there. So imagine my surprise when Scream Factory released this on a double feature Blu-Ray (with Bert I. Gordon's much more fun EMPIRE OF THE ANTS - 1977), which made me buy this sucker, because that is exactly what I am when it comes to watching bad films. And, boy, is this bad! The film opens up on a train (a multi-car train with only three people aboard!), where one guy complains about the barking dogs he is in charge of, while another guy says he has a king cobra locked in a box and it has been sleeping the entire trip. Or so he thinks. When the guy goes to another car to check on the dogs, both doors to the train car lock by themselves and the padlock on the king cobra's cage opens by itself. Suddenly, the double doors on the side of the car opens and the guy is thrown out of the speeding train as if by some supernatural force and then the king cobra comes face-to-face with its handler (you can plainly see the glass partition between the guy and the snake, just like Harrison Ford and the snakes in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981). The king cobra bites its handler on his face (we never actually see any snake bites in this film, only the after-effects, and since the film is about snakes, I fail to see the point as to why this film was made) and the train suddenly stops on its own (we later find out that the engineer was bitten by a rattlesnake). The screen then goes black when this suddenly appears: ""And the angel seized the serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years...after that he must be loosed for a little while."" REVELATIONS 20: 2,3 (Now just wait a minute: Aren't the Devil and Satan the same fallen angel? And how much time is ""a little while""? 24 hours? A week? A month? A century? Already, I'm more confused than a one-legged man at an butt-kicking contest.). We then see Father Tom Farrow (Fritz Weaver; CREEPSHOW - 1983) enjoying his dinner and telling his housekeeper this joke: Q: ""Do you know why a pig is like a saint?"" A: ""He gets more praise after he's dead than alive."" The housekeeper reprimands him by saying, ""That's not the type of joke one expects to hear from a priest!"" and he apologizes (It seems to me that Father Farrow (or Fritz Weaver himself) liked his wine a little too much during this film. My bet is that Weaver knew he was making a piece of excrement and tried to stay inebriated throughout. We then are at a party thrown by town patriarch Matt Perry (Bob Hannah), who is celebrating the opening of a dog track in town in a couple of days. Father Farrow (who is against the dog track because he believes gambling is a sin) meets Evelyn Downs (Diana Douglas, mother to actor/producer Michael Douglas, who passed away in July of 2015), a self-professed witch who passes out when she touches Father Farrow's cup (Alcohol poisoning? Just kidding.). He walks Evelyn to her car, where she tells him he is in terrible danger and has a powerful enemy. She tells Father Farrow that Satan is after him and wants his soul. Evelyn is positive she is right and deep-down inside, Father Farrow does, too (But what priest is not the object of Satan's desires? Isn't that one of Satan's duties?). The train is located and the snake handler is found barely alive (The engineer bitten by the rattler will be OK after given a shot of anti-venom). He is brought to the hospital and looked after by Dr. Maggie Sheridan (Gretchen Corbett; LET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH - 1971), who has never seen a snake bite like this and calls in Father Farrow to give her patient the Last Rites because he is going to die. She hopes to find out more about what bit her former patient by the coroner, but all he can do is show her his body (his face is all swollen, this film's idea of horror) and tell her that he must have been bitten by a renegade snake that he has never seen before. Maggie calls in herpetologist Dr. Paul Hendricks (John Korkes; SYNGENOR - 1990) to look at the corpse, much to the displeasure of Matt Perry, who thinks this will disrupt the opening of his dog track (Remind you of any film?). When Maggie and Paul get to the coroner's office, the corpse and coroner have disappeared and dollars to donuts you can bet this is the work of Mayor Thorpe, (Jack Gordan; Matt Perry has his hand so far up the Mayor's behind, he could use him as a ventriloquist dummy). Father Farrow gets a phone call from Evelyn, who makes him promise to stay inside for the night. She has something important to tell him and she is driving over to talk to him. There is another deadly snake bite and Paul gets to see this one. Unfortunately, the victim is Evelyn. Sheriff Tatum (John McCurry) keeps getting phone calls and reports of snakes all over town (it turns out that the king cobra is able to control all the snakes in the area) and a rattlesnake slithers into Maggie's bathtub just as she is about to take a shower (some quick fleeting nudity in what is probably Corbett's stand-in). When she steps in the tub, the rattlesnake is gone, but when she gets into bed, it is there waiting for her. She calls Paul on the phone to come over ASAP to save her. Paul goes running down the stairs of the only motel in town (In what is obviously a mistake, a painting falls off the wall. Everyone who has stayed in a motel knows that paintings are screwed into the walls so no one can steal them.) and rushes over to Maggie's house. He pins the rattlesnake to the wall and blows it's head off with a pistol he is carrying (Well, the head doesn't exactly blown off as it just take a bullet hit to the head and dies). Maggie and Paul become lovers (Anyone surprised by that?) When Father Farrow learns of Evelyn's death, he is now fully convinced something evil has taken over the town, especially when he learns she died of a snake bite. He goes to the Monsignor (Norman Lloyd; AMITYVILLE 4: THE EVIL ESCAPES - 1989) to voice his concerns. The Monsignor is not surprised at all and tells Father Farrow that the satanic snake is real and Farrow's family is closely involved with it. He tells Father Farrow that the snake is the reason why his father committed suicide (Father Farrow never knew that about his father) and the snake goes after every third generation of Farrows (Father Farrow is not a third generation Farrow, but the Monsignor makes up some supernatural mumbo-jumbo to make it seem like the snake doesn't care. You'll be scratching your head until it bleeds.). The Monsignor tells Father Farrow to be very careful because, ""A priest will make a bright flame in Hell."" More and more snake attacks occur, but the Mayor puts a lid on it with the Press and TV news, obviously influenced by Matt Perry and the precious opening of his dog track. Deputy Jack (Larry Jordan) is attacked and killed by the king cobra while Father Farrow is conducting Evelyn's funeral outside. Father Farrow (who loses his crucifix at Evelyn's grave) and the Monsignor are chased through the graveyard by the king cobra (the Monsignor suffers a fatal heart attack) and Father Farrow falls into an open grave, but he make a crucifix out a piece of iron gate and the king cobra disappears. Matt Perry gives Father Farrow, Maggie and Paul eighteen hours to find and kill the snake. No matter what, the dog track will open, but he will ruin their careers just for the heck of it. That night, little Elizabeth Perry (Christina Applegate) runs outside to retrieve her cat and when she comes back inside, her mother, Elizabeth (Nancy Priddy), grounds her, which means she will not be able to go to the dog track opening in the morning. That doesn't stop her, as she sneaks into the dog track, only to be bitten by a rattlesnake (again, we don't see the snake actually bite her). Elizabeth rushes to get her daughter medical care, while her unfeeling father still wants to open the dog track. The Mayor finds a chance to grow a set of balls and tells Matt that the track will not be opening that day and Elizabeth makes Matt stay behind while she has their daughter taken to the hospital, as punishment for putting everything else over his family. Paul finds the king cobra's hiding place in a cavern, but he slips and knocks himself out when he hits his head on some rocks. Maggie locates Paul in the cavern and they both find themselves trapped by the snake, but right in the middle of giving Mass at his church, Father Farrow has a vision and leaves the church with his congregation looking confused. Father Farrow heads for the caverns and performs a really quick exorcism on the snake and it catches on fire. The fight between good and evil has been fought and good wins out, as the film fades to black for the end credits with the king cobra on fire.  There's not much positive to say about this abomination, except to say there are too many ""WTF?!?"" moments in this film, such as when Matt Perry hires a biker (Mike Smith) to run Maggie off the road to assault her (he also sticks a gun in her mouth), only to get scared off by the king cobra. There is also a shot of a mouse being killed in a spring trap that serves no purpose in the film. It's clear that director Bob Claver has no idea what a horror film should look like because this is a dreary 92 minute affair that has almost no horror in it. The only thing that can remotely be described as horror are the looks of the snake handler and Evelyn's faces after they have been bitten by the cobra. Otherwise, it's just POV of snakes attacking and a total lack of gore and blood. It also comes as no surprise that this was screenwriter Gerry Holland and producer Bill Wilson's only film credit. This film is a failure of the highest order and if you want to see how not to make a horror film, by all means watch this. Dean Cundey does give the film a nice polished look with his cinematography, but like they say, you can put a pretty bow on an ugly pig, but it will still be an ugly pig. For bad film fanatics only. I know that I will enjoy the other feature on this Blu-Ray a lot more than this sad excuse for a horror film and I have seen that one at least a dozen times. The theatrical trailer (the only extra for this film) contains footage not seen in the film. You will spot it right away as soon as you see it. Also starring Alene Simmons, Mary Lyons McEvoy, Bill Gribble, Jamie Lawrence, David Fawcett, Sarah Wilson and Mark Richards. A Scream Factory Blu-Ray Release. Rated R, but there is really nothing so offensive in this film that would make it go past a PG-13.",1442793600,,12664,4.425449871465296
8700715,4,B00T73AQIM,"A couple of schlocky ""big animals on the loose"" films from the 1970's show up on this double feature from the crew at Shout! Factory.

EMPIRE OF THE ANTS is the better of the two films. One of legendary low budget producer Bert I Gordon's last films before retiring. Big selling point at the time was Joan Collins in the starring role. Truth be told, she doesn't get much more screen time than the rest of the ensemble cast. Genre actors Robert Lansing, Albert Salmi and John David Carson lend their talents. IMHO smokin' hot damsel in distress Pamela Shoop easily outfoxes Joan Collins. I think they hired Pam simply because of how well she filled out the red silk top her character wears, sans bra, throughout the film. LOL. The effects are your typical Mr. B.I.G. tropes: cheap, full-size animatronic ant puppets inter-cut with footage of regular ants, optically enlarged to appear 6-8 feet long, and crudely matted into the frame in a (mostly failed) attempt to look like they're threatening our on-screen heroes & heroines. The shoddy F/X service the story well enough, but are the purest low budget throwback techniques. If you enjoy such stuff you'll enjoy EoTA. If you insist on modern ultra-realistic CGI and whatnot then the ""scary shots"" will be laughable, at best.

JAWS OF SATAN (on-screen film title is ""KING COBRA"") is a real hoot. I'd never seen it before and found it to be a lot of corny fun. Fritz Weaver steals the show as a local priest facing a mid-life & religious conviction crisis. Perfect movie timing has our sinister serpent slither into town and start offing the local yokels. Turns out the snake is the physical embodiment of the Devil himself, sent to kill (or at least really annoy) our good man of the cloth. Surprisingly however, for a flick that touts such a whacked-out ""JAWS meets THE EXORCIST"" vibe, the film is actually quite tame. It plays more like a TV movie of the week than a big budget theatrical release, and for a killer animal movie I was surprised and a little disappointed that there wasn't much gore (or genuine scares, sadly). While JoS isn't exactly one for the kiddies it still pails in comparison to others of its ilk, such as PROPHECY or the immortal GRIZZLY. Even so, I quite enjoyed it.

THE BLU-RAY: Both features are on a single-sided disc. They look good, but JAWS OF SATAN has a noticeably cleaner & sharper picture than EoTA. Audio is about the same on both features: level & solid, but nothing spectacular. Certainly nothing to put a modern home theater system through its paces. Sadly, there are no special features for JAWS OF SATAN. EMPIRE OF THE ANTS includes the theatrical trailer (in pretty rough shape), a TV ad spot, and what is perhaps THE worst feature-length audio commentary track I have EVER heard. Some guy named Kevin Sean Michaels conducts a running commentary with Bert Gordon. Bert is in his 90's now, so his wandering attention span & difficulty hearing are both understandable and excusable. There is, however, no excuse for the disappointing NON-preparation on the part of Mr. Michaels. He appears to have never seen the movie he's commenting on. Ever. He continually makes asinine comments, asks the stupidest of questions and cracks decidedly UNfunny jokes throughout. Had this thing been promoted as a comedy track, then it *might* have been somewhat entertaining, but since it was produced (I am guessing) as a sincere attempt to inform fans of both the film & Mr. Gordon, it fails. Utterly & completely. Kevin, if you are reading this, please do your homework from now on! Watch the movie a couple of times, especially right before recording the commentary so everything is still fresh in your mind. That way you'll sound like you at least have a passing knowledge of the film you're discussing, instead of coming across like a clueless Mystery Science Theater reject. Even with that mess as a strike against it, I can still strongly recommend this Shout! Factory Blu-ray double feature of EMPIRE OF THE ANTS and JAWS OF SATAN for fans of 70's exploitation flicks and those who love those crazed creatures on the loose films. 4 STARS.",1440288000,4,4125,4.7745098039215685
