4373656,4,B004GJYRM8,"Usually these collections throw one or two good movies and the rest consist of movies no one would buy, but these one is really a good seletion, I don't mean that they are all great movies or all the good movies from Eastwood are here, but there are some really good movies in these package, some clasics and some not so good but completly watchable, and for these price you could not buy half of the good movies here if you wanted to buy them separately.",1339027200,3,455,4.3023255813953485
4373657,5,B004GJYRM8,What can I say about this pack that you probably don't already know?  It consists of a bunch of great movies that Clint worked on.

4373658,4,B004GJYRM8,The Collection is a good cross-section of Eastwood's many movies.  It is an interesting way to see Eastwood mature as an actor and director.  A good choice!,1317600000,5,156,4.7407407407407405

4373660,3,B004GJYRM8,"An excellent idea for Clint Eastwood collection, but on 10 movies, 3 are repeating from others productions already.
It's strange that the movies companies didn't learn fron the experience of the music business. We are very few to buy and pay for DVD's nowadays, so why are you trying to make money with the same movie 2 or 3 times?

In a very short time, all users will go on the web again, and for free, gonna have access to anything without paying a dime to producers who are so thirsty of profit at any cost.

For the time left, you should consider to put different movies that you didn't already produced on other edited box set in order to sell it, and respect the audience who are faithfull to you.

Memory would tell that music business are actually looking for new way of selling, while people are definitely in the opposite direction evrmore, why repeating the same patterns and expecting different results?",1314489600,14,916,4.607361963190184
4373661,5,B004GJYRM8,"Clint Eastwood is a living legend who is still just as popular today as he was 50 years ago, with films he's directed and/or starred in that have frequently received much acclaim from critics and fans alike.

To celebrate Mr. Eastwood's legacy, Warner Brothers, the studio Clint has worked with the most in Hollywood, released a career spanning DVD box set entitled: Clint Eastwood: 35 Films 35 Years at Warner Bros.. What a lot fans wanted to know was ""What about Blu-Ray?"" Warner Brothers has responded with this 10 disc Blu-Ray collection, which picks some of the actor's best efforts along with a couple of wonderful films he did not star in, but directed.

This is currently Eastwood's second to last performance on screen, and easily one of his finest. The disc is exactly the same as the previous stand alone release. Extras include a nice 20 minute segment entitled ""The Eastwood Way"" which focuses on Clint's filmmaking process, along with 2 other featurettes: ""Manning the Wheel"" & ""Gran Tornino: More Than a Car,"" which are okay, but not as much fun as the other one.

The Blu-ray includes a number of bonus features, including ""Red Sun, Black Sand: The Making of Letters from Iwo Jima,"" a fascinating account of how the film was made, as well as a number of other interesting featurettes such as ""The Faces of Combat,"" which focuses on the cast of the film, ""Images From the Frontlines,"" which highlights the photography of the film, as well as the World Premiere coverage of the film from Budo-kan in Tokyo and the original press conference footage in 2006.

Morgan Freeman rounds out the outstanding performances in this Best Picture Oscar winner. Extras include the James Lipton Roundtable interview with all three actors, a discussion segment with boxer turned actress, Lucia Rijker, entitled ""Born To Fight,"" and a behind the scenes featurette with the producers.

Extras include an audio commentary track with Tim Robbins & Kevin Bacon, the Charlie Rose interviews with Clint Eastwood, Tim Robbins & Kevin Bacon, the featurette entitled ""Mystic River: From Page to Screen"" which chronicles bringing the book to life on film, and author Dennis Lehane tours the original Boston neighborhood for which his book is based on.

I'm guessing this film was included to cash in on the recent popularity with Charlie Sheen. A fun film, but not a classic. A vintage featurette entitled ""Clint, The Rookie & Me"" is stated, on the back of the case, to be included, when in fact it is not. The original theatrical trailer is included.

DTS-HD MA English 5.1, Dolby Digital French 2.0 & Spanish (Castilian 2.0 & Latin 1.0)

I really enjoyed this set of Eastwood films all together in one collection. The picture quality was quite good, especially on the newer releases. Some fans may be disappointed by the older Blu-ray releases on this set, like ""Unforgiven,"" which weren't given better picture & audio upgrades like the later Blu-rays with their True-HD Master Audio tracks.

I was a little disappointed that some of the special features were missing too, like the vintage featurette from ""The Rookie,"" and the trailers to ""Absolute Power"" & ""Million Dollar Baby."" It was nice to have ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" included with this set, but disappointing that ""Flags of Our Fathers"" was not also included, as the two films go perfectly together. I love ""Dirty Harry,"" as most Eastwood fans do, but it has already been previously released on Blu-ray 4 times. Surely another classic like ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" or ""Heartbreak Ridge"" could have been included instead.

All in all, the films are good and the quality is good enough, but still could have been better. I sincerely hope that this box set collection sells well enough for Warner Brothers to warrant coming out with a ""Volume 2"" and subsequent future volumes after that, so we can have all of Clint's WB films in a 5 box sets collection instead of having to buy them all individually. For what you pay, this is a pretty good deal. Check it out. You'll be glad you did.",1275523200,62,10007,5.7527027027027025
4373662,5,B004GJYRM8,Clint Eastwood's movies are not just normal movies. His movies are consistently amazing. He makes movies that he knows people will like/relate to and enjoy always. From the always classic Dirty Harry to the emotional Letters from Iwo Jima or Mystic River to the Best Picture Western Unforgiven (I hate Westerns and this is the only western I can watch). His films are always great and always worth seeing. I am buying this right now.,1274313600,8,433,4.786666666666667

4373669,5,B004GJYRM8,"I haven't watched all the movies but I watched 2 so far and looked at the video quality at a couple others and I have to say that for the video quality of some of the movies produced in the 90s and early 2000s this is an outstanding set.  I'm glad the original camera work was excellent quality then, because it really shows on bluray.  If you like Clint Eastwood this is a no-brainer if you don't have the movies already, and the cost is unbeatable.",1412121600,,450,4.22093023255814

4373671,1,B004GJYRM8,"This was a total bait and switch.  I ordered thirty five years, thirty five movies from clint eastwood for my wife's birthday and they sent me this instead.  She only will like two movies from this false advertising scam costing me about thirty bucks apiece.  What they advertised cost about two or three bucks a movie and she would have enjoyed most of them.  Instead another birthday is ruined because they do not make good on their websites mistakes.

4373674,5,B004GJYRM8,"If you are a Clint Eastwood fan, you can't go wrong with this collection. Spans his  a career, though it is missing a few films I would have added (The Outlaw Josie Wells, Two Mules for Sister Sara, and Play Misty for Me) it's a great collection, and well worth the price.",1361059200,,272,4.230769230769231
4373675,5,B004GJYRM8,I have alwasy appreciated Clint's work. Not only as a actor but also as a director. These movies show the best of both. From his earlier work through current.

4373677,5,B004GJYRM8,"A great collection of Eastwood films from a golden oldie, DIRTY HARRY, to one of his most recent LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA. My personal favorite is Gran Torino followed up by seven more of his best films. One of his"" man with no name""  spaghetti westerns would have been the only way to improve this selection. For the Clint Eastwood fan  this collection of films are a must.  Is there a way to improve on a on already great sellection of films? Put them on Blu-Ray and watch them on a 50"" flat screen.",1359676800,,498,4.276595744680851
4373678,4,B004GJYRM8,"This is a collection of ten of Clint's movies (Eight he acted in and two he just directed). It's a bit of a mixed bag from mediocre to great movies, but not a single bad one in the bunch. This collection was also chosen well to showcase Clint's diversity from drama to action to comedy (Although he played the straight man in the comedy) to directing. My only complaint would be that they included Letters from Iwo Jima but did not include Flags of Our Fathers. Those two films should really be viewed as a set because they're meant to be two sides of the same story and by only watching Letters from Iwo Jima you could easily misinterpret its intention.",1359590400,4,654,4.413223140495868
