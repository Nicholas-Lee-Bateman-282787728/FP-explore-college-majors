3144220,4,B0015DLZXM,"Feng Xiaogang is better known for colorful epics such as ""The Banquet"" in the U.S.. Well, the Chinese filmmaker is poised to redefine war epics in the Chinese war film ""The ASSEMBLY"" (2007). The Chinese have dubbed this film as their answer to the award-winning film by Spielberg; ""Saving Private Ryan"" and to South Korea`s ""Tae Guk Gi"". The film is a powerful achievement in Chinese cinema, because of the humanity of its portrayal and the technically sound intense battle sequences. The film was inspired by true events.

The film takes place during the Chinese civil war of 1948 between the Communist People's Liberation Army and the Nationalist Kuomin Tang forces (KMT). Captain Gu Zidi (Zhang Hanyu) leads the 9th Company (139th Regiment) and the group is determined to win at any cost. Gu did time in prison for killing his captive P.O.W.'s after they've already surrendered. Reassigned to the frontlines to defend a mineral mine from the approaching KMT Army, the 9th company is outgunned and outnumbered by the approaching army--this KMT Army is equipped with tanks, and heavy artillery. Gu's 9th company suffer heavy losses that leads to the men arguing as whether they should fight or retreat, they are supposed to retreat once they hear a Bugle call but Gu's hearing has been impaired during one of the assaults. Some soldiers say that they heard it while some didn't--Gu is unable to verify whether or not the Bugle call has been made, so he commits his men to fight on--to the very last man standing.

The first half of the film focuses on the 9th company's experiences in the frontline. The film's battle sequences are among the best I've seen and undoubtedly the best ever produced in Chinese cinema. The sequences are gripping, intense and riveting as you see the men of the 9th company fight on to the last man. Shot in a grayish hue, (almost black and white) and shaky camera work, the film has that very realistic feel. Director Feng manages to shoot the scenes with a lot of power and intensity--although I have to say that some of the shots isn't exactly very harmonious or doesn't really mesh well as with ""Saving Private Ryan"". There is a lot of blood and gore, a lot of spewing mud and powerful explosions. Don't get me wrong, the scenes are VERY exciting and riveting but for some reason, it felt that it lacked an emotional connection; the disagreements between Gu and his C.O. Wang (Yuan Wenkang) does have its merits but I thought they were just your usual conflicts. The battle sequences are indeed a near stellar achievement in Chinese cinema, but without a proper inner conflict, the scenes lose some of its effect. The usual overwhelming army against a small band of soldiers have been done numerous times before but hey, the battle isn't any less exciting.

The second half of the film focuses on Gu's struggle as a half-deaf war veteran. Director Feng does successfully flesh out its main character as Gu first enlists in the Korean war before he attempts a post-war existence. For some reason, any records of the 9th company or Gu himself has been lost by record keepers. Gu becomes very frustrated that the sacrifices of his men are unrecognized by the country they fought for--to ensure the continued power of the State. I think Feng was trying to move to a political commentary as we all know the score: Bureaucrats tend to use soldiers as expendable resources and make body counts irrelevant for the common good. Sadly, this is the work of a soldier.

The film's human drama itself becomes very predictable and offers nothing new. Please keep in mind that Feng is a very mainstream Chinese director and of course, he would never make a critical war film. The movie is very China-friendly and full of flag-waving elements. The inner issues Gu experiences is very defined but the film itself offers no surprises in this regard. Serving in the People's army is portrayed as a righteous cause and the existing authority figures will no doubt take care of its soldiers. Thankfully, Zhang Hanyu's performance is convincing enough although some scenes had the dangerous potential to become overly melodramatic.

""THE ASSEMBLY"" is not a perfect film. The film's main premise is very involving but it just doesn't really ""click"" as a ""pure"" epic war film. I have a few ideas as to how this film could have been better--Feng's decision to avoid the political issues somewhat kills the film's emotional potential. Instead, the director opts to make the portrayal of war in human ""effect"" and sidesteps any indictment or finger-pointing at any political body for the causes of war itself. Feng's war epic is very ""friendly"" and it never approaches the level of excellence in emotions as achieved by other war films. The film is very ""human"" in its approach and very sympathetic--although not entirely patriotic. The film offers nothing surprising or offers a complex dramatic resolution. The film never chooses a side (Feng Xiaogang would be banned from filmmaking if he did so) and the film is definitely geared towards an international audience. ""The Assembly""'s emotional content is very basic but despite its massive commercial appeal, the film still commands high esteem.

Highly Recommended!! [4+ Stars]",1227052800,2,5236,4.8907657657657655

8258117,5,B0015DLZXM,"I ordered this after seeing the reviews here in Amazon. I expected them to be right and I was not disappointed, to say the least. One of the best re-telling of human drama in a wartime setting, and told from a perspective we hardly see, from a Communist. If you love the rawness of Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and The Pacific, then you'll love this one. One of the most excellent cinematography out there. A great example of human emotions and the struggles of people living in a chaotic world. I cannot stop extolling its virtues.",1359417600,2,542,4.540816326530612
8258118,5,B0015DLZXM,"Assembly was a movie I discovered by accident when surfing the Youtube one day. I found a music video using the battle scenes from this movie and I was wondering what the heck it was from as the footage looked a lot like the Battle of the Bulge scenes from Band of Brothers but with Chinese or Korean actors. After poking around in the comments and Wikipedia for a little bit, I discovered that Assembly is a Chinese movie made in 2007 and is hailed as one of the best mainland China produced films to date. I found it on Amazon and ordered it. After watching it I can see why it was so critically acclaimed. It has some of the best battle scenes I have seen since Band of Brothers and The Pacific. It has some amazing cinematography and while confusing in the middle, a very well done human element that ties the movie together well at the end.

The film starts off in 1948 during the Chinese Civil War with PLA Captain Gu Zidi (played by Zhang Hanyu) as his battered company takes a war torn town in the dead of winter. If you've seen Band of Brothers, it will remind you a lot of the Battle of the Bulge episodes. After taking the town with heavy losses, his company, now at only 50% strength, is ordered to hold the Battalion's flank at an old mine near a river bank.  He is ordered not to retreat until he hears the bugle call for assembly with the rest of the regiment.  After a day of brutal fighting with Chinese Nationalist forces (yes, the good guys in this are the communists), the company has taken heavy losses and cannot hold out but the CO has yet to hear the bugle call so they can not retreat.  The film then skips ahead to the Korean War which Gu is now taking part in. He serves as a forward observer and befriends a young artillery officer when he steps on a landmine and manages to save him from it with a pretty neat but suicidal trick. This scene is actually slightly funny as an American tank crew happens upon them however; they are dressed in South Korean uniforms so the Americans think they are friendly. The tank commander walks over to see what they are doing, sees the guy on the landmine and is like `oh shit! Well, that sucks. Good luck with that!' gets back in his tank and drives off. This scene ends with you thinking that Gu dies with the mine going off. The movie then skips forward to the mid 50's after the wars are over and Gu is revealed to still be alive but now blind in one eye from the injury he took from the mine. The officer he saved is now a high ranking officer in the PLA and is offering to help him with work and other needs. Gu then reveals that he was the lone survivor of the company that he commanded during the Civil War and has been living with this guilt since that day. He seeks to find the resting place of his men and to get full honors for his company however; the government is suspicious of what exactly happened to him after the battle and will not recognize him and his men's actions during the war. Driven by outrage and guilt he tries to find where battlefield was, now a fully operation coal mine, and starts digging to find where the bodies of his fallen comrades are.  This is where the film gets really depressing as many people dismiss him as a crazy old war vet but let him keep trying to do what he is going to do. After digging day and night, he learns that his company, and himself are finally given the honors they deserved all this time. A memorial is erected at the site and Gu finally has peace.

The strongest part of this film is the cinematography. Like I said before, the battle scenes are epic, brutal, and realistic. They definitely take cues from movies and series like Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan but it's not only the battle scenes that are well shot. There are beautiful and creative camera angles throughout the film including a beautiful shot of the memorial at the opening and closing of the film. It does climax early though; all the battle scenes are in the first hour of the film and, like most war movies, are the best scenes. The middle of film is kind of confusing as it jumps around the years for a little bit but it does all come together by the end.  Like a lot of war films, there are some clich&eacute;s like the soldiers sneaking on the battlefield to steal things from a dead enemy officer only to get shot by a sniper once finding what he was looking for and little things like that but it doesn't harm anything other than the fact that you can see it coming. The acting is generally very good, especially Zhang Hanyu's star performance. Obviously, this movie is in Mandarin Chinese as it should be. The bluray I have only had subtitles and I don't think it has been dubbed and, well, it shouldn't be.

One very strong point of the film is that even though it is a patriotic film about China it never loses sight of the human element in this movie. The characters are the main focal point here and what the main character goes through. There are some scenes that probably wouldn't have set too well with the Chinese government had this movie come out a couple decades ago.  That said, you might want to go into this movie after doing a little research on the Chinese Civil War and post WWII China as it doesn't give very much context to go by if you're not a Chinese history buff. One thing that caught my eye in the film was the weapons they used. They use a mixture of WWII era British, Russian, and German rifles and machine guns while the Nationalists used mostly American weapons and equipment which is another interesting point to research about the war.

Overall, I'd say this is a must watch if you are a fan of war movies, Chinese movies, and foreign films.  I'm not sure if it's on Netflix or anything like that. I bought it off Amazon for about $17 imported (and that's a good price for an import). While the middle is a bit confusing and you might want to do some research going in, the first hour and ending of the movie is amazing and I gotta say, it is one of the best war movies I've ever seen. I highly recommend it if you can find it.

8258119,3,B0015DLZXM,"First of all, war is the most internecine activity we humans have created and actively participated throughout history.  Having said that, I find this movie, about the struggle of a Chinese soldier during and after his participation on several wars, fascinating.  A reminder that war goes on for soldiers even after the battle has ended.  As a person who has lived in the Western hemisphere under a democracy it's easy to believe the propaganda fed by our government about why we go to war just as easy as they do on the other side.  And even easier to demonize those whose culture and ideology are different from ours.  Assembly is a great antiwar probably without being its intention.

The battle scenes are merciless and realistic.  ""Even gods would pee if they were to face combat"" is a more realistic assessment of the real feelings involved in war than what most Hollywood made movies have led us to believe.  The second act of the movies shortly show us the Korean war from the Chinese's viewpoint. And the third act of the movie deals with the aftermath for those who survive and have to deal with catastrophic loss even when the governments who made fought and the civilians quickly forget about those who were senselessly killed at war.",1351123200,2,1246,4.736111111111111
8258120,5,B0015DLZXM,"One of the best Korean War movies ever made. Only Koreans, not many Americans in it. But worth watching. I never wrote about a movie before, this is the first. That shows how much I liked it. Tons of action!",1338076800,4,207,4.2
8258121,5,B0015DLZXM,"This movie is more than a war movie, it's also about the struggle that all soldiers feel about forgotten friends.  Civilians often don't want to hear about it and don't want to remember the sacrifices of the fallen. This story is a true one about a company that is destroyed in the chinese civil war (1920's-40's) with a break in their to fight the japanese , it carries on into the korean war too as we follow the survivors struggles to gain acknowledgement for his fallen comrades. This is a universal story and it stands solid for the soldiers of all wars. This movie shows us how soldiers are bound together in suffering no matter what ideology they fought for. And the chinese communist one is one histories bloodiest , but the soldiers in the chinese army were not murderers or ideologues they were just men. This movie is one of the greatest war movies ever made in my opinion because it shows how a man cannot let go of his fallen friends. And remember this man also fights The u.s. in korea (the worst regime in the world at that time and probably today as well)  and it still doesn't matter because he's just a soldier who is fighting for his friends first of all.  The battle scenes are true to life and this is the way all battles should be shown , in all their horror and fear. But what is touching is the story after the two wars are over for our character and the fact that fellow soldiers still try to look out for him. Every soldier should see this movie and perhaps they can understand why they hurt so deep inside sometimes. The world forgets but the soldier cannot and the people he fights are often men like him in military values. Except when fighting  insurgents , some of whom  use civilians as shields. or even worse terrorists. But men and women of the trained army from whatever nation can
relate to the struggle that captain c goes through to bring justice to his men's memory.  The blu ray looks stunning and it's battle scenes are among the truest and best out there , alongside pvt ryan and other realistic movies. So grab this one and remember those who have served honorably in any nation.",1276041600,6,2122,4.4282051282051285
8258122,5,B0015DLZXM,"and the misery that comes to those who are caught up in it is brought to frightening reality on the big screen in this masterfully filmed effort by Feng Xiaogang. The story of a Chinese regiment fighting against the Nationalists in the brutal civil war manages to tug at almost every human emotion. The protagonist officer who leads his men in a savage last stand is perfectly portrayed. The scenes of warfare in this movie are very well done and manage to do so without demonizing the enemy as in so many war films. For those of you who know such things, and there are many, the range of weaponry used in this film spans the the entire history of modern warfare for the Chinese from the 1920's on through the war in Korea and adds greatly to the intense realism of the film. Watch for the scene in which the Captain sees what has become of the old helmets once used by the soldiers.

The main character, Captain Gu Zidi, superbly played by Zhang Hanyu, cannot give up the memory of his lost men and never ceases in his struggle to have their memory honored. The portrayal of this struggle by this one man gives this film everything thing it needs for great drama. This work has a far stronger story than ""Saving Private Ryan"" and in modern cinema can only be rivaled by South Korea's ""Tae Guk Gi"". This is not only a great war film but is one of the very best films of any kind I have been privileged to see in recent years.",1249084800,3,1425,4.317164179104478
8258123,4,B0015DLZXM,"After seeing Tae Guk GI, I really got interested in foreign movies. This happened to be one that I picked up. My reactions towards this movie are mixed. Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie. It's just that it really isn't a single movie, it's more like two movies combined into one. The first half of the movie is about the civil war fought in China in 1948 (I think, I don't know too much about Chinese history). The second half, is more of a drama about the aftermath with a few political sidenotes here and there.
  That said, I did enjoy the movie. It does have its' flaws (mainly weak character development), but they're easy to forgive given the chaotic war of the first half and the intriguing drama of the second half.
