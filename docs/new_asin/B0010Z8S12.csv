3057434,5,B0010Z8S12,"I have seen the ""baby you can read English version"" and this is a very good one for baby to learn chinese. I am native Chinese and live in US now. Love the pronunciation, love the songs and love the word choices. My baby loves watching it.just wish the flashcards have pictures on it.",1312329600,5,284,4.277777777777778
3057435,4,B0010Z8S12,"I used them with my two year old but they don't keep her attention.  She knows that it's ""chinese"" and has learned a handful of words, but doesn't have much interest in watching the discs.  She asks me to switch it out to something else.  Maybe for the next child I'll start younger.",1307318400,,283,4.30188679245283
3057436,4,B0010Z8S12,"I bought these dvds for my daughter who is 2 and a half and had watched a lot of other baby Chinese videos like Little Pim, Early Start Mandarin Chines, Language Tree Chinese, and the videos by MeiMei. I think these are geared more toward really little ones. My daugther will watch them but the characters and scenes are not as engaging as some of the other videos. She repeats along with it much of which is words she learned from other videos. I do not think I would buy the second set at her age. For a toddler I'd recommend the other videos listed above. My daughter really liked the MeiMei videos because they had a lot of little kids singing and playing games.",1296518400,,666,4.336
3057437,2,B0010Z8S12,"I purchased the set hoping to increase my baby's ability in reading Chinese. I like the fact that it is based on the the methodology of the book ""Gentle Revolution"", but the way that the CD is organized is simply too boring for my 19 month old baby. Other similar programs could keep him entertained again and again but this program doesn't even make it all the way through the first time viewing before he walked off to his toy trucks...
But to be fair, the third CD (animals) was okay -- the other two are simply too boring didn't quite cut it.",1275868800,,546,4.310679611650485
3057438,4,B0010Z8S12,"It's a good product for a toddler or child to learn Mandarin. It's a good tool for adults who are learning Mandarin/Putongqua, too. It's a very simple visual and repeat program to acquire the language; therefore, it's very basic. The way it should be for babies, toddlers and children learning a new language, since we mainly speak English. My child and I enjoy it a lot. It has the similar format like Baby Can Read program for learning English. Price is just slightly higher than another website, which sells Chinese language programs and books, too.",1262044800,,552,4.821052631578947
3057439,5,B0010Z8S12,"I love this set of DVDs!  I started showing to my son when he was only 6 months, and he's now 2.5 and STILL loves this set.  I think his favorite is the incorporation of chinese nursery rhymes between segments and seeing other asian children on the screen singing and dancing.  he definitely learned from this set.  And I did too!  Highly recommend to Chinese-American households!",1261440000,2,380,4.696969696969697
3057440,3,B0010Z8S12,"This dvd set can be a good start-up to learn Chinese.
But the dvds don't have any stories, they are just a series of words and images. The whole set is for teaching 100 words, which are not close to learning a language!

After one viewing, it is already very boring for my 2 year old son.

I think $40 ($10 for each DVD and the flash cards) should be more than enough price for this set.",1243036800,9,387,4.012987012987013
3057441,5,B0010Z8S12,"These DVD's are well made, and appeal to my baby son, and his young cousins. The images are easy for children to relate to, and the continual use of ""nursery rhyme"" music holds their attention. I also find these easy to watch and I am learning along with him. The themes are basic; colours, numbers, animals etc, and they overlap throughout the CD's, which helps with familiarization. The flash cards are also a good aid, which helps with the correct pronunciation. If there were more DVD's in the set I would certainly purchase them.",1210896000,5,534,4.691489361702128

She is excited to learn the language and she would repeat each word. I'm excited for her as it will give her a leg up from other kids as she advances.",1207267200,2,306,4.203389830508475

8239646,3,B0010Z8S12,Its a cute video but its not high quality and lacks interest. Its not a story with characters so the attention and interest for little ones will be very limited. There are two short segments. First being domestic/farm animals (old McDonald) and the second being wild and zoo animals with another song.,1519603200,,301,4.8076923076923075
8239647,1,B0010Z8S12,"This DVD shows a flash card and videos of animals. It repeats the name of the animals only three times (in the green box set they repeat each new word in Chinese five times).  They also had a mistake and show the wrong flash card at the end. So the children listen and see the flash card of sheep and then see image of a pig, and then listen to the word and see the flash card of pig in Chinese and see a duck in the video.",1475798400,,423,3.8068181818181817
8239648,5,B0010Z8S12,My toddler loves these videos.  My seven-year-old (even though he won't admit to it) also sits and watches them while they're on.  I mostly put this on while making dinner and have found that even I have picked up a few of the words.,1453248000,,233,4.2727272727272725
8239649,5,B0010Z8S12,My baby has been watching these DVDs for about 4 months. Not sure if he has learned anything because he is only 12 months old but he dances to the songs. He loves it a lot as he runs to the TV as soon as the DVD is on.,1427932800,,218,3.4693877551020407
8239650,1,B0010Z8S12,"It would be good for only 1 year old babies because it is very very quiet. I does not teach you how to read at all which was my main purpose for my 3 year old. The cute characters are not engaged in teaching, but sometimes show up. They don't talk at all. I gave one star because it does teach the target words, but that is it. Whereas Little Pim, Rock and Learn kids-Mandarin and ect. really teach kids  many many words,  this one just plays pictures of objects without any voice.  I returned it. Its value is very very low.",1398297600,,525,4.127450980392157
8239651,5,B0010Z8S12,I purchased the entire set of DVDs and only expected my girls to learn the basics from them.  My 20 month old (who just turned 24 months) watched them everyday for about 3 weeks and was slowly able to read the flashcards!  Needless to say we were shocked!  I purchased the 6-12 year old DVDs as well and wished there were more available because I would love for my little ones to continue to learn more Chinese.  She can read the majority of the flashcards now and is eager to learn more!,1389225600,,488,4.271739130434782
8239652,5,B0010Z8S12,If your child loves animals this is a great one! My daughter picked up the names very quickly!  We also have the first and second one. The first is definitely better than the second. The food one (2) has a lot of food items we don't have readily available in the US.,1359849600,,266,4.115384615384615
8239653,4,B0010Z8S12,"I really like ""baby learns chinese""and my baby is very interested..one advice-You can stream it for free on YOUTUBE!!!I wanted to buy DVD's or rent them at the public library since it easier to play them on tv but they are too expensive, free ...well it's free..:)",1327190400,4,264,4.638297872340425
8239654,5,B0010Z8S12,"I heard and i think it is good for young children to listen to a variety of sound to practice their listening and pronounciation skills. So I bought this chinese lesson to give them a chance to understand a bit of chinese one day. It is wonderfull because my niece (2,5) and my nethew (16 months) watch it as a cartoon and love the songs. They repeat what the little chinese children on the video say. Pictures and cartoons are great and perfectly adapted. It is fun an educational. I am really happy of my choice.",1326153600,,514,4.364583333333333
8239655,4,B0010Z8S12,"So my 1 year old daughter kind of likes these DVD.  My husband's family is Chinese and they speak fluent Mandarin and Cantonese.  My husband only knows how to speak Cantonese but even his cantonese is not very good.  So we ordered these DVDs to aid us in teaching our daughter some basic Mandarin.  While at first my daughter is interested, she soon become disinterested after about 10 minutes.  I love the songs that sung in Mandarin occasionally throughout the video because it is the only thing that draws my daughter back in.  I will say that I like the DVDs, and have learned from them!!  It's a great purchase and I think it's worth giving it a try.  The material is very organized so you aren't jumping around from body parts to vegetables.  They group like things together then teach them too the baby through repetition and pictures.  Give it  a try, I am sure you will learn something.",1318377600,,895,4.53125
