5819879,5,B00DJYK0OK,"I'm over fifty years old now and slowly realizing my second childhood is my best one.  I'm a grown man now with resources enough to buy whatever I want and no parents to stop me.  Growing up autistic meant TV was my best friend and among my TV favorites was Marine Boy.  Today Marine Boy would be considered anime' and art. I just consider Marine Boy good old fun.  Marine Boy is simple fun.  Marine Boy is a kid who basically lives underwater by use of oxyi-gum.  He has friends in his underwater world most obviously a pet dolphin that is quite smart.  The stories are simple but in some ways very ineteresting.  I love the archietecture of many of the buildings.  The people are funny.  Marine Boy action and adventure is a lot like that encountered by Speed Racer.  Marine Boy has his little puppy love interest but it never gets too sappy.

The awesome thing about this digital and technical revolution we live in is now I get to see Marine Boy as a high quality image on a 55 inch digital color flat screen. I last saw Marine Boy on a12 inch black & white TV screen whose picture was good only if you wrapped the atenna in foil and touched the refrigerator while holding one of the rabit ears.  Even if the Marine Boy image quality is NOT the top notch remastered perfections some holler for I love it.  The image quality and color are so much better than what I had that buying this Marine Boy First Season was a no brainer for me.

Ahhh eating a stack of Grilled Cheese Sandwiches watching Marine Boy after a hard day of hell spent in school.  I grew up poor, not dirt poor but we were not rich.  I must say however that laying on my bed, eating grilled cheese and watching Marine Boy, I felt richer than any of the so called 1% who have all the money in the world.  One is truly old when they can no longer enjoy life's simpliest pleasures.  Grilled Cheese Sandwiches and Marine Boy one of life's true simple pleasures!  Ahhh the sweet memories.  Buy Marine Boy and reawaken your own sweet memories.",1392854400,33,2008,4.329758713136729
5819880,5,B00DJYK0OK,"Quite simply a brilliant adventure cartoon for the era in which it came out (1966).  The story elements are just soooo damn  COOL!  Marine Boy had the special red underwater suit, Oxi-gum for underwater breathing, a pet Dolphin (not to mention a dolphin ring whistle), and his really slick jet propeller shoes.  But the absolutely best part of Marine Boy's arsenal was of course his Totally Awesome, Butt Kicking ELECTRIC BOOMERANG!  Now, because of the times in which we live in, not all young kids will appreciate it this series the way we did. But I have no doubt that there are a lot of little young ones who will enjoy it none the less.  And if it were done just right, an updated animated feature film would simply rule at the box office.  But only if done right (and that includes marketing).",1392422400,3,799,4.545454545454546

5819931,5,B00DJYK0OK,"One of my most favorite shows of all time, ran concurrently with, Speed Racer, Kimba the White Lion and Ultraman on WDCA-20 (Channel 20) in Washington D.C. after school. The DVD is GREAT! The sound quality is good, the color and resolution of the animation has held up well, but you can still tell that it's dated, but still, story and animation wise, better than any cartoon the kids watch today! Have kids of your own? Do yourself and your children a favor, cancel your cable or satellite  service and force your children to watch the shows we watched in the 1970s! They'll be better off for it, and thankful to you later in life once they realize how much smarter and creative they are compared to their contemporaries!!!!",1425859200,5,725,4.62015503875969

5819933,5,B00DJYK0OK,"For years this title was only available on murky video tapes or PAL transferred DVDs.  Now it's available in this set, with great color and sound, and complete and uncut.  You can't go wrong if you are wanting to see this great show again.  I highly recommend all three ""seasons"" of the show, though they really aren't meant to be watched all at once.",1423180800,2,351,4.453125
5819934,5,B00DJYK0OK,I loved this show as a kid..and i STILL do Many childhood favorites DO NOT hold up under the scrutiny of adulthood but Marine Boy does quite easily. I found myself drawn back in to the adventures of our aquatic hero and his stalwart companions Piper and Bullton as well as his mermaid friend Neptina and pet dolphin Splasher. My 20 year old son has even watched and enjoyed these episodes with me so pass on the animated goodness!!,1419552000,5,431,4.468354430379747
5819935,5,B00DJYK0OK,I used to watch this after grade school in the sixties and love to watch it again. Thank you Amazon for being the time machine that brought Marine Boy back for me to enjoy again....love it!  Terry,1395360000,2,196,4.297297297297297
8593910,5,B00DJYK0OK,"The nostalgia factor is key here for me. I was 3 or 4 when I first saw it, around the same time as Astroboy!
I always thought the art and animation was more sophisticated back then, and for its time it was, compared to american productions.",1523577600,,240,4.239130434782608
