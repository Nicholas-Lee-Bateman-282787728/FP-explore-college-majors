 But back in '62 when the Cold War between Russia & the U.S. & nuclear obliteration seemed imminent, 1979, when this is set, seemed far in the future.
  From far out in space, from some unknown dark galaxy, comes something that can destroy anything it comes in contact with. It's literally a dark molten, planet sized death star, headed on a random path of collision right into Earth.  People have been warned but are mostly thinking that scientists & the authorities will take care of it.  A 1st team of astronauts fly near it to get data  to relay info back to the space station & to Earth. In the process of trying to leave they realize that they can't go, their rocketship is powerless against it, & they come to realize that they're going to die. The gravity of Gorath is so strong that once near it, it's impossible to get away. But before they're killed they relay the news of it back.  Later back on Earth another team of astronauts prepare to go into space to observe & destroy it. But theres the problem of Gorath getting more powerful, even larger, feeding off of anything that flies into it, it's a giant magnet, so blasting it with nuclear missiles is useless. And the threat of Gorath, even if it misses the Earth not far enough, the gravity will pull everything off the surface of our planet, life on Earth would end.  But while the worried people of Earth go about their lives, the scientists, government officials of all countries & the military are all in accord to try & save the planet.
 I saw this on tv as a kid. & Even though those early Japanese sci-fi movies are old now,  if you can overlook some toy models that are still effective (I dig that Anker Jet), & a string or 2 in the special effects, you will see that theres a human story going on here too, of family, friendship, & love.  As all people work through things, together, to save this Earth.  It's 1 of the early movies that had a messege of worldwide unity.  But also, it has another certain seriousness to it: Earth has REALLY been hit by meteors & asteroids in the past, some larger than others, we can only hope that we truly DON'T get hit with something from space we can't win against.  To me anyway, even if this movie isn't perfect, it IS, something of a gem.",1496620800,,2363,4.353075170842825
