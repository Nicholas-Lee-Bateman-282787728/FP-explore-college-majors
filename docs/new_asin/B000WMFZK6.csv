2986704,5,B000WMFZK6,"""Solstice"" is one of the best indie films I've seen to date.  Everything works so well in this movie.  There is very good character development, above par acting and directing, interesting backstory, plot twists with exciting suspense, really creepy atmosphere (a perfect location and setting for mystery/suspense; close to the swamps down in Louisiana), very good cinematography, and an unexpected ending with a twist.  This film is very well paced and has you guessing around every corner as it gradually unfolds the story, a really good spooky story aimed at getting your attention and keeping it until the end credits roll.  That's an 'A'.",1235433600,2,643,5.153846153846154
2986705,5,B000WMFZK6,"Megan and her friends, Christian, Zoe, Mark and Alicia head to her old family home in Nowell Lake to celebrate the Summer Solstice. The only problem is that Megan is still haunted by the suicide of her twin sister Sofie six months earlier. While shopping at a supply store on the way to the house, Megan befriends Nick who gives her a magazine telling her about communicating with the dead during the Solstice. Whilst in the house, Megan is haunted by what she believes to be the ghost of Sofie which is symbolised by a key chain that Sofie had the night of her death. While investigating the mystery hauntings, she starts to become suspicious of Nick and after finding a photograph of a missing girl named Malin, she starts to unravel an even darker secret that may hold the key to her sisters death. Throughout the film we are given flashbacks of the events leading up to the suicide of Sofie. We are taught that it's not just a girls way of getting out of a tough spot, Sofie is haunted by a curse which she desperately wants to get away from. This ultimately causes her to take a drastic decision that will effect Megan for the months to come.

Now being a straight to DVD movie I didn't expect much, I expected it to be filled with clichs and to be actually, not that scary. I was wrong as this was a film that a lot of the time gave me the creeps. I expected it in some ways to be very in your face with the hauntings from the beginning. It was nothing of the sort as it paced itself well, it didn't seem to want to be a clich movie where the girl thinks she's going crazy and so does everyone else until they die or something ridiculous like that. It didn't rush it, it didn't treat the viewer like a child with the attention span of a sparrow. It paced the hauntings and built them up brilliantly until the climax.

The cast is strong with the biggest star in it possibly being Shawn Ashmore of X-Men fame. The acting is both solid and believable and the actors manage to draw you into the situation and make you a part of the situation. Elisabeth Harnois during the ""six months earlier"" scenes is forced to play both Megan and Sofie, which is a true test of acting ability. She does it well and the conversations and interactions between the two seem un-faltered.

I enjoyed the film and I know a lot of horror fans will too. It's not for the faint hearted as it has its genuinely frightening parts. Buy it and enjoy it, you won't be disappointed. I only wish that more straight to DVD movies were as good as this.",1224288000,2,2523,4.307368421052631
2986706,4,B000WMFZK6,"A more than competent supernatural thriller (a remake of the Danish film ""Midsommer"") that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout and have you jumping out of your skin on more than one occasion. The story maintains a fine pace, wasting no time getting down to the creepy stuff and keeping you guessing right to the very end. The story is set in the swamplands of Louisiana and involves a group of high school seniors (why do these things always involve teenagers, I wonder?) trying to come to terms with the recent death of Sophie, twin sister of one of their number (Meghan). Although it strikes me that spending the week of the summer solstice in the remote holiday home owned by Sophie and Meghan's family is probably not the best way to do that.

Unlike many films of this genre, ""Solstice"" manages to both build suspense and become steadily more scary without descending into the realms of complete silliness. (Well, OK, it has some moments of moderate silliness as well as a fair collection of clichs obligatory to the genre but these never really detract from the action -- although they will probably destroy your trust in Louisiana plumbing, as well as putting you off watermelons, for ever more.)

All in all, though, this is worthy addition to the genre and it would be a good idea to grab yourself a copy in time for Halloween.",1221868800,,1350,4.620833333333334
2986707,4,B000WMFZK6,I wasn't expecting much when I rented this movie. I was shocked when I found myself drawn into the plot and feeling suspenseful for the characters. This was an excellent ghost story with a good twist in the plot.,1217721600,,212,4.461538461538462
2986708,3,B000WMFZK6,"I'm a huge One Tree Hill fan, so I had to buy this movie since Hilarie Burton and Elisabeth Harnois are two of the main characters. The movie is about a girl (Harnois) who's twin sister commits suicide. Trying to cope with the loss of her sister, she and friends travel to a remote house to vacation for the summer solstice. As the movie progresses, we learn more and more as to what may have caused the suicide of her sister, and it's her responsibility to solve the mystery.  Others in this film include Amanda Seyfried (Mama Mia, Big Love) and Tyler Hoechlin (7th Heaven) -- both who have great performances!

The movie has some scary moments in the ""boo -ahh"" sense, nothing to graphic or violent. The voo-doo stuff was a bit unrealistic to me, but I am a very skeptical person to begin with. This was a good scary movie compared to others that have been released lately. It's not incredibly stupid like One Missed Call or Pulse, and it's not just about gore (think The Hills Have Eyes and Saw 1-300 (lol) ).

I love a good scary movie and I think that this defintely delivers better than most of the recent horror releases.",1214438400,2,1128,4.4396135265700485
2986709,5,B000WMFZK6,"Hollywood, I hope you are taking notes. This is what a thriller should be like. Please make more like this one. The background music, usually a simple tune that you feel like you've heard before, is perfect. The character development is just enough to hold interest, and yet, not bore. We follow the main character, a girl who has lost her twin sister in death. She hallucinates (or does she?) strange occurrences during her grief. This movie is gore-free, so the scares are the kind that jump out and say ""boo"" rather than ""ew,"" which just goes to show you can have a scary movie, without the blood. There is substantial action, but there are also lulls in the movie; these occur at points in the movie when the plot is being developed. I kept trying to figure out the plot twist, because in this type of movie, there is always a plot twist. I am always impressed when I can't figure it out. (Where is the fun in always knowing what is going to happen?) I admit my bias towards supernatural movies, especially involving a holiday close to my heart--Midsummer solstice. Most movies reduce the celebration of these holidays to something evil, but thankfully this one refrains from making a mockery of it. If you enjoyed the odd black and white scenes from the movie ""The Ring,"" you will enjoy the opening credits. The movie itself is in color, but there is an ethereal feeling about those scenes, which are important later on. The scenery throughout is lovely, haunting. Again, Hollywood, please make more movies like this.",1208044800,4,1522,4.682835820895522
2986710,4,B000WMFZK6,"I am drawn to a dvd that has a cover like Solstice does. Reminds me of all the 'wanna be' movies that came out after 'Scream' and I guess even 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'. I usually expect them to be bad, with maybe a decent moment that might...MIGHT...make me jump or feel uneasy or look up at my second floor balcony that peers into the living room where shadows look like ghosts in the dark.

With this movie though, I watched it with a big group of friends since I was at work and nothing much was going on (and I'm in Iraq so its not like I get to go home to watch it on my TV..heh). The whole group I was with was pretty much into the movie. Of course watching a movie like this will have a bunch of guys, when together, blurting out to the TV for someone to 'just take your top off already' or 'man this movie would be a lot cooler if she'd take her top off'. Guy talk. But after about 20-30 minutes of that, most of everyone was sitting still and getting into the movie.

I think that was because the movie itself has an actual story and the scares are pretty much spread out pretty far from each other. I honestly cant remember the characters names due to me watching this with a group of people. But the names I remember us using was 'Hot Girl' (the main actress), Iceman (the actor that plays Iceman from X-Men), Veronica Mars' dead friend, and then you have the couple who just filled a role because you think they are exterminable. But like another reviewer said, a lot of stuff that you think is going to happend..doesnt. And that's good cause I'm tired of being able to guess the whole movie in about 3 minutes.

Our group of teenagers are spending their senior week (seriously how long has our Iceman been doing teenager roles? For like 6 or 7 years now? Geez) up at a family cabin. One night 'Hot Girl' wakes up to find that the car is on and a item of her dead sisters is lying in the car. She then begins to see wierd things throughout the movie that leads her to believe her sister is haunting her, but why? Maybe it has something to do with the wierd old creepy guy that she meets while taking a jog one morning. I mean hell...it's R. Lee Ermey...so of course I'm gonna start thinking it has to do with him. Have you seen the remake or the prequel of Texas Chainsaw Massacre? I will forever have him in my head as that psychotic cop now. Not the drill segeant from Full Metal Jacket...or not even the dad of the Janitor from 'Scrubs'. But that damn cop and his cold killer ways.

I will warn you though. The movie might seem slow and might seem like it's not going anywhere for quite awhile. But once the movie starts to wrap itself up, you'll be pleasantly pleased with it. I did not see the ending coming for once. Maybe it's cause I wasn't paying 100% attention at the time, but honestly I think its just because they actually surprised me.

If you are walking those isles of Blockbuster or cruising the lists trying to think of a movie to throw in your Netflix queue, then give this movie a try.",1207785600,13,3026,4.201376936316695
2986711,5,B000WMFZK6,"Anytime you get Elisabeth Harnois on the screen, it's a definite watcher.  I am a huge fan of hers from the tv series ""Point Pleasant"".  This movies keeps you interested and has a coolness factor similar to ""Urban Legends"" & ""Urban Legends Bloody Mary"".  I recommend watching Solstice.",1200268800,2,285,4.895833333333333
2986712,4,B000WMFZK6,"....everything you'd expect doesn't happen.  Following a setup delightfully lifted from every slasher film, five students head off to celebrate ""Senior Week"" at a spooky old house in the Louisiana woods.  En route to the place, the happy kids pass a creepy-looking old man standing alongside the road....

....and they get to their destination safely, where they promptly begin to do all of the things kids in slasher films do.  They get drunk, go swimming, sit up late by firelight, and two of them sneak off to have sex.  But when morning comes....everyone is still alive!  However, some decidedly odd things have begun to happen.

While the film gradually builds its storyline out of elements both real and possibly supernatural (or are they figments of the imagination?), director Dan Myrick (""The Blair Witch Project"") skillfully aims his camera into the story, wisely including a few scenes which viewers must surely be expecting (there is a ""shower scene"", a sequence of the ""creepy old man"" ominously walking around carrying a machete, etc.) but which never turn out as they would in a formula film.  There are a few echoes of ""The Haunting Of Hill House"", with past traumas of each of the characters surfacing in various ways to ultimately become the driving force behind the plot.  The kids discover each other as they discover themselves, and ultimately discover a secret which leads to a double surprise ending (part of which is a bit contrived....but you won't see it coming!).

No film of this type is complete without a few bits of humor and insider gags, and ""Solstice"" delivers.  An early scene shows a minor character wearing the beanie made famous by ""The Blair Witch Project"", a bulletin board at a country store features several of the ""missing"" posters made famous by the same film, and R. Lee Ermey's character's name will bring a chuckle to those familiar with his earlier films.  Watch closely and you will most likely notice other similar items.  Yes, there's a scene lit only by the flashlight carried by a character running through the woods.

We've seen some of this storyline before, and the acting on the part of the principal characters is pretty much what you'd expect from a no-name cast of early 20-somethings.  But the unexpected take on the story delivers a worthwhile ride, with a nervous giggle here and there, often when you least expect it.  You won't regret the time spent watching this one.  Those expecting another ""Blair Witch Project"" are likely to be very surprised, but ultimately not disappointed.",1199836800,23,2546,4.925058548009368

2986781,1,B000WMFZK6,FIVE STAR - WHAT?TF? This movie is so boring you're going to need something strong to keep you awake.  It dragged on and on and on as I kept waiting for something to happen and what did I get - RIPPED OFF!  No gore-No scares-bad acting- did I mention no gore or real horror moments to stimulate the brain This should not even be categorized as a horror flick.  If you're into multiple flashbacks this flick is for you. If you're into sleeping during the movie...this is definitely for you.  My dogs were snoring so loud on HORROR movie night is was pathetic. I looked at other folks who rated the movie five and most had no other movie ratings posted which tells me there is a nasty stinky lying skunk in the house.,1467331200,,715,4.313432835820896

2986822,4,B000WMFZK6,"Megan's twin sister has recently committed suicide, and it was a shock to everyone. She was popular, had a terrific boyfriend, and was on top of the world, no one knew just what happened. To celebrate her memory, her sister and a group of their friends go to their summer house for the weekend, and that's when Megan starts seeing things. Her friends think she's nuts, but Megan feels that her sister is trying to tell her something, so Megan goes on a quest to find answers. Why is it always the low budget films you hear nothing about, that turn out to be the most interesting? I honestly thought this was going to be another weird supernatural slasher film, but it wasn't at all. Solstice gives you so many angles and so many things to focus on, including intense flashbacks, a terrific mystery, a creepy neighbor, a missing child, a love story, and of course attractive people skinny dipping. The focus of the film seems quite evident early on, but it really isn't, as Solstice twists and turns in so many directions, that by the time it's over, you'll be left with your mouth open. The cast comprised of normally ancillary characters was terrific, especially Elisabeth Harnois. Her face may be familiar to film-goers, but not because of any leading roles, she has bided her time, taking small roles, learning as much as she could to use in performance like this one. Solstice was her chance to finally take the reigns and she did it with grace and intensity. The rest of the cast, featuring some well-known teen idols, also doesn't disappoint as Matthew O'Leary was hilarious, Shawn Ashmore was the level headed one, and Tyler Hoechlin was wonderfully weird. As I said early, Solstice is a thriller that has it all, from the supernatural to an earthly mystery, it is one terrific film, that doesn't stay in one place for very long. The rural setting and the way the story is told, with well timed flashbacks, just make everything that more intense. It may be a low budget, independent film, but it's better than anything you'll see on the big screen right now and I can't recommend it enough.",1431820800,5,2097,4.654986522911051

2986851,4,B000WMFZK6,"""Solstice"" (2008) was made by the creator of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B000KDZSA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>"", Daniel Myrick, and is a more conventional horror flick. Like ""Blair"", ""Solstice"" takes the subtle route with the creep factor and the typical trappings of slasher or quasi-slasher flicks; so stay away if you need serious gore, sex and nudity with your horror.

The film runs 90 minutes and the first hour plays out like myriad other monster/ghost movies -- a group of youths venture to some secluded area to party and tensions increase as the creep factor increases. What separates ""Solstice"" from, say, most of the Friday the 13th flicks, besides lack of gore, is the serious and realistic vibe of the proceedings. While this is welcomed by me, it also makes for a less entertaining viewing -- for the first hour, that is.

The last half hour is where everything comes together and there's almost a Wow factor as you realize what's really going on and what happened, etc.

While the cast are all no-names, except Amanda Seyfried (who wasn't that well-known at the time), they're effective enough. They could've done better with the women, but the main protagonist is decent, Elisabeth Harnois.

The film was shot in Louisiana.

2986859,2,B000WMFZK6,"There are two things that might be of interest to some viewers. One is that director of ""Solstice"" is Daniel Myrick, who co-directed a hugely successful horror ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1999 (with Eduardo Snchez). The other is his latest film stars Shawn Ashmore (""Iceman"" of the ""X-Men"" franchise) and Amanda Seyfried (a young bride-to-be in ""Mamma Mia!""). As a horror film, however, ""Solstice"" offers little more than familiar scares and ineffective narrative despite its stars, beautifully shot photography and some intriguing narrative elements.

""Solstice"" follows the story of Megan (Elisabeth Harnois) trying to recover from one shocking incident that happened to her family, and her friends Christian, Zoe, Mark and Alicia. They travel to a quiet lake house for their annual summer trip, where Megan starts experiencing strange things, like seeing things. Megan comes to believe that some supernatural presence is trying to contact her, perhaps her twin sister Sophie, to let Megan know some secrets. Or maybe she is mistaken.

I can't reveal it in detail, but in the second half of the film an interesting development takes place as Megan realizes the truth about the weird images she continues to see. But the film's slow-paced earlier part is boring with clichd devices such as moving shadows and a ""creepy"" old guy (R. Lee Ermey). In the end of the film everything is explained and some of the characters, including R. Lee Ermey's ""Leonard,"" show unexpected sides, but it takes too long (more than 50 minutes) before the film reaches that point.

According to the opening credit, ""Solstice"" is based on a 2003 Danish film ""Midsommer."" Perhaps something is lost in translation. Perhaps not. Whichever it is, I feel there is a better movie buried in here.",1283040000,,1768,5.089655172413793

The cast is strong with the biggest star in it possibly being Shawn Ashmore of X-Men fame. The acting is both solid and believable and the actors manage to draw you into the situation and make you a part of the situation. Elisabeth Harnois during the ""six months earlier"" scenes is forced to play both Megan and Sofie, which is a true test of acting ability. She does it well and the conversations and interactions between the two seem un-faltered.

I enjoyed the film and I know a lot of horror fans will too. It's not for the faint hearted as it has its genuinely frightening parts. Buy it and enjoy it, you won't be disappointed. I only wish that more straight to DVD movies were as good as this.",1224288000,2,2523,4.307368421052631
3221203,4,B000WMFZK6,"A more than competent supernatural thriller (a remake of the Danish film ""Midsommer"") that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout and have you jumping out of your skin on more than one occasion. The story maintains a fine pace, wasting no time getting down to the creepy stuff and keeping you guessing right to the very end. The story is set in the swamplands of Louisiana and involves a group of high school seniors (why do these things always involve teenagers, I wonder?) trying to come to terms with the recent death of Sophie, twin sister of one of their number (Meghan). Although it strikes me that spending the week of the summer solstice in the remote holiday home owned by Sophie and Meghan's family is probably not the best way to do that.

Unlike many films of this genre, ""Solstice"" manages to both build suspense and become steadily more scary without descending into the realms of complete silliness. (Well, OK, it has some moments of moderate silliness as well as a fair collection of clichs obligatory to the genre but these never really detract from the action -- although they will probably destroy your trust in Louisiana plumbing, as well as putting you off watermelons, for ever more.)

All in all, though, this is worthy addition to the genre and it would be a good idea to grab yourself a copy in time for Halloween.",1221868800,,1350,4.620833333333334
3221204,4,B000WMFZK6,I wasn't expecting much when I rented this movie. I was shocked when I found myself drawn into the plot and feeling suspenseful for the characters. This was an excellent ghost story with a good twist in the plot.,1217721600,,212,4.461538461538462
3221205,3,B000WMFZK6,"I'm a huge One Tree Hill fan, so I had to buy this movie since Hilarie Burton and Elisabeth Harnois are two of the main characters. The movie is about a girl (Harnois) who's twin sister commits suicide. Trying to cope with the loss of her sister, she and friends travel to a remote house to vacation for the summer solstice. As the movie progresses, we learn more and more as to what may have caused the suicide of her sister, and it's her responsibility to solve the mystery.  Others in this film include Amanda Seyfried (Mama Mia, Big Love) and Tyler Hoechlin (7th Heaven) -- both who have great performances!

The movie has some scary moments in the ""boo -ahh"" sense, nothing to graphic or violent. The voo-doo stuff was a bit unrealistic to me, but I am a very skeptical person to begin with. This was a good scary movie compared to others that have been released lately. It's not incredibly stupid like One Missed Call or Pulse, and it's not just about gore (think The Hills Have Eyes and Saw 1-300 (lol) ).

I love a good scary movie and I think that this defintely delivers better than most of the recent horror releases.",1214438400,2,1128,4.4396135265700485
3221206,5,B000WMFZK6,"Hollywood, I hope you are taking notes. This is what a thriller should be like. Please make more like this one. The background music, usually a simple tune that you feel like you've heard before, is perfect. The character development is just enough to hold interest, and yet, not bore. We follow the main character, a girl who has lost her twin sister in death. She hallucinates (or does she?) strange occurrences during her grief. This movie is gore-free, so the scares are the kind that jump out and say ""boo"" rather than ""ew,"" which just goes to show you can have a scary movie, without the blood. There is substantial action, but there are also lulls in the movie; these occur at points in the movie when the plot is being developed. I kept trying to figure out the plot twist, because in this type of movie, there is always a plot twist. I am always impressed when I can't figure it out. (Where is the fun in always knowing what is going to happen?) I admit my bias towards supernatural movies, especially involving a holiday close to my heart--Midsummer solstice. Most movies reduce the celebration of these holidays to something evil, but thankfully this one refrains from making a mockery of it. If you enjoyed the odd black and white scenes from the movie ""The Ring,"" you will enjoy the opening credits. The movie itself is in color, but there is an ethereal feeling about those scenes, which are important later on. The scenery throughout is lovely, haunting. Again, Hollywood, please make more movies like this.",1208044800,4,1522,4.682835820895522
3221207,4,B000WMFZK6,"I am drawn to a dvd that has a cover like Solstice does. Reminds me of all the 'wanna be' movies that came out after 'Scream' and I guess even 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'. I usually expect them to be bad, with maybe a decent moment that might...MIGHT...make me jump or feel uneasy or look up at my second floor balcony that peers into the living room where shadows look like ghosts in the dark.

With this movie though, I watched it with a big group of friends since I was at work and nothing much was going on (and I'm in Iraq so its not like I get to go home to watch it on my TV..heh). The whole group I was with was pretty much into the movie. Of course watching a movie like this will have a bunch of guys, when together, blurting out to the TV for someone to 'just take your top off already' or 'man this movie would be a lot cooler if she'd take her top off'. Guy talk. But after about 20-30 minutes of that, most of everyone was sitting still and getting into the movie.

I think that was because the movie itself has an actual story and the scares are pretty much spread out pretty far from each other. I honestly cant remember the characters names due to me watching this with a group of people. But the names I remember us using was 'Hot Girl' (the main actress), Iceman (the actor that plays Iceman from X-Men), Veronica Mars' dead friend, and then you have the couple who just filled a role because you think they are exterminable. But like another reviewer said, a lot of stuff that you think is going to happend..doesnt. And that's good cause I'm tired of being able to guess the whole movie in about 3 minutes.

Our group of teenagers are spending their senior week (seriously how long has our Iceman been doing teenager roles? For like 6 or 7 years now? Geez) up at a family cabin. One night 'Hot Girl' wakes up to find that the car is on and a item of her dead sisters is lying in the car. She then begins to see wierd things throughout the movie that leads her to believe her sister is haunting her, but why? Maybe it has something to do with the wierd old creepy guy that she meets while taking a jog one morning. I mean hell...it's R. Lee Ermey...so of course I'm gonna start thinking it has to do with him. Have you seen the remake or the prequel of Texas Chainsaw Massacre? I will forever have him in my head as that psychotic cop now. Not the drill segeant from Full Metal Jacket...or not even the dad of the Janitor from 'Scrubs'. But that damn cop and his cold killer ways.

I will warn you though. The movie might seem slow and might seem like it's not going anywhere for quite awhile. But once the movie starts to wrap itself up, you'll be pleasantly pleased with it. I did not see the ending coming for once. Maybe it's cause I wasn't paying 100% attention at the time, but honestly I think its just because they actually surprised me.

If you are walking those isles of Blockbuster or cruising the lists trying to think of a movie to throw in your Netflix queue, then give this movie a try.",1207785600,13,3026,4.201376936316695

3221209,4,B000WMFZK6,"....everything you'd expect doesn't happen.  Following a setup delightfully lifted from every slasher film, five students head off to celebrate ""Senior Week"" at a spooky old house in the Louisiana woods.  En route to the place, the happy kids pass a creepy-looking old man standing alongside the road....

....and they get to their destination safely, where they promptly begin to do all of the things kids in slasher films do.  They get drunk, go swimming, sit up late by firelight, and two of them sneak off to have sex.  But when morning comes....everyone is still alive!  However, some decidedly odd things have begun to happen.

While the film gradually builds its storyline out of elements both real and possibly supernatural (or are they figments of the imagination?), director Dan Myrick (""The Blair Witch Project"") skillfully aims his camera into the story, wisely including a few scenes which viewers must surely be expecting (there is a ""shower scene"", a sequence of the ""creepy old man"" ominously walking around carrying a machete, etc.) but which never turn out as they would in a formula film.  There are a few echoes of ""The Haunting Of Hill House"", with past traumas of each of the characters surfacing in various ways to ultimately become the driving force behind the plot.  The kids discover each other as they discover themselves, and ultimately discover a secret which leads to a double surprise ending (part of which is a bit contrived....but you won't see it coming!).

No film of this type is complete without a few bits of humor and insider gags, and ""Solstice"" delivers.  An early scene shows a minor character wearing the beanie made famous by ""The Blair Witch Project"", a bulletin board at a country store features several of the ""missing"" posters made famous by the same film, and R. Lee Ermey's character's name will bring a chuckle to those familiar with his earlier films.  Watch closely and you will most likely notice other similar items.  Yes, there's a scene lit only by the flashlight carried by a character running through the woods.

We've seen some of this storyline before, and the acting on the part of the principal characters is pretty much what you'd expect from a no-name cast of early 20-somethings.  But the unexpected take on the story delivers a worthwhile ride, with a nervous giggle here and there, often when you least expect it.  You won't regret the time spent watching this one.  Those expecting another ""Blair Witch Project"" are likely to be very surprised, but ultimately not disappointed.",1199836800,23,2546,4.925058548009368

3221319,4,B000WMFZK6,"Megan's twin sister has recently committed suicide, and it was a shock to everyone. She was popular, had a terrific boyfriend, and was on top of the world, no one knew just what happened. To celebrate her memory, her sister and a group of their friends go to their summer house for the weekend, and that's when Megan starts seeing things. Her friends think she's nuts, but Megan feels that her sister is trying to tell her something, so Megan goes on a quest to find answers. Why is it always the low budget films you hear nothing about, that turn out to be the most interesting? I honestly thought this was going to be another weird supernatural slasher film, but it wasn't at all. Solstice gives you so many angles and so many things to focus on, including intense flashbacks, a terrific mystery, a creepy neighbor, a missing child, a love story, and of course attractive people skinny dipping. The focus of the film seems quite evident early on, but it really isn't, as Solstice twists and turns in so many directions, that by the time it's over, you'll be left with your mouth open. The cast comprised of normally ancillary characters was terrific, especially Elisabeth Harnois. Her face may be familiar to film-goers, but not because of any leading roles, she has bided her time, taking small roles, learning as much as she could to use in performance like this one. Solstice was her chance to finally take the reigns and she did it with grace and intensity. The rest of the cast, featuring some well-known teen idols, also doesn't disappoint as Matthew O'Leary was hilarious, Shawn Ashmore was the level headed one, and Tyler Hoechlin was wonderfully weird. As I said early, Solstice is a thriller that has it all, from the supernatural to an earthly mystery, it is one terrific film, that doesn't stay in one place for very long. The rural setting and the way the story is told, with well timed flashbacks, just make everything that more intense. It may be a low budget, independent film, but it's better than anything you'll see on the big screen right now and I can't recommend it enough.",1431820800,5,2097,4.654986522911051

Like ""Blair"", ""Solstice"" takes the subtle route with the creep factor and the typical trappings of slasher or quasi-slasher flicks; so stay away if you need serious gore, sex and nudity with your horror.

The film runs 90 minutes and the first hour plays out like myriad other monster/ghost movies -- a group of youths venture to some secluded area to party and tensions increase as the creep factor increases. What separates ""Solstice"" from, say, most of the Friday the 13th flicks, besides lack of gore, is the serious and realistic vibe of the proceedings. While this is welcomed by me, it also makes for a less entertaining viewing -- for the first hour, that is.

The last half hour is where everything comes together and there's almost a Wow factor as you realize what's really going on and what happened, etc.

While the cast are all no-names, except Amanda Seyfried (who wasn't that well-known at the time), they're effective enough. They could've done better with the women, but the main protagonist is decent, Elisabeth Harnois.

The film was shot in Louisiana.

3221356,2,B000WMFZK6,"There are two things that might be of interest to some viewers. One is that director of ""Solstice"" is Daniel Myrick, who co-directed a hugely successful horror ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1999 (with Eduardo Snchez). The other is his latest film stars Shawn Ashmore (""Iceman"" of the ""X-Men"" franchise) and Amanda Seyfried (a young bride-to-be in ""Mamma Mia!""). As a horror film, however, ""Solstice"" offers little more than familiar scares and ineffective narrative despite its stars, beautifully shot photography and some intriguing narrative elements.

""Solstice"" follows the story of Megan (Elisabeth Harnois) trying to recover from one shocking incident that happened to her family, and her friends Christian, Zoe, Mark and Alicia. They travel to a quiet lake house for their annual summer trip, where Megan starts experiencing strange things, like seeing things. Megan comes to believe that some supernatural presence is trying to contact her, perhaps her twin sister Sophie, to let Megan know some secrets. Or maybe she is mistaken.

I can't reveal it in detail, but in the second half of the film an interesting development takes place as Megan realizes the truth about the weird images she continues to see. But the film's slow-paced earlier part is boring with clichd devices such as moving shadows and a ""creepy"" old guy (R. Lee Ermey). In the end of the film everything is explained and some of the characters, including R. Lee Ermey's ""Leonard,"" show unexpected sides, but it takes too long (more than 50 minutes) before the film reaches that point.

According to the opening credit, ""Solstice"" is based on a 2003 Danish film ""Midsommer."" Perhaps something is lost in translation. Perhaps not. Whichever it is, I feel there is a better movie buried in here.",1283040000,,1768,5.089655172413793
