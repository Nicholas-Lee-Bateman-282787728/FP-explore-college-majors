8088456,5,B000BKVSB4,"YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SUFFERING TO TRY TO FIND THAT BETTER LIFE. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES, THESE GUYS HAVE TO PASS OVER 3 RIVERS AND IT IS VERY SAD WHAT THEY GO THREW.",1322784000,,171,3.7777777777777777
8088457,5,B000BKVSB4,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. I WOULD HAVE LIKED FOR IT TO HAVE ENGLISH SUBTITLES SO THAT I COULD SHARE IT ONES WHO DONT SPEAK SPANISH. IT TELLS THE STORY OF WHAT THIS SOCIETY CALLS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM MEXICO GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR AND THEIR DIFFICULT JOURNEY TO THE U.S.A.  ITS A SAD STORY BUT A REAL ONE. SOME THE ACTORS IN THIS FILM ARE REAL LIFE MUSICIANS MEMBERS OF A GROUP CALLED LOS TIGRES DEL NORTE SO THERE IS SOME GOOD MUSIC IN THIS FILM.  BEAUTIFULL MUSIC FROM EL SALVADOR , GUATEMALA, AND MEXICO.",1268006400,,514,4.4
