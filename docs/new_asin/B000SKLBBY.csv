8205695,4,B000SKLBBY,"Released in 1991, Ghostly Thrillers combines two different shorts of a spooky nature, The Ghost in the Shed and The Youth Who Wanted to Shiver, onto one tape. Both shorts are based on stories from books (The tape comes from Golden Books). Certainly more for use in classrooms of children during the Halloween season than anything else, Ghostly Thrillers might hold some nostalgia for some. Recommended if you're looking for something that won't scare the kids or want to relive childhood memories.",1429488000,,497,5.073170731707317
