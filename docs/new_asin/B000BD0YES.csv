Many many thanks to Amazon who makes these ""old"" movies available to purchase.  The movie came prompty and was perfect in condition.  I am a relatively new fan of Charles Bronson and this is one of the very few movies I have seem him in where he isn't an Indian, or a heavy, or a killing machine or something like it.  This is a western and he is in a romantic role in this one and that is what made it special to me.  I've also always liked Susan Oliver (the female interest) and a very young Kirt Russell is adorable.

I would think that if anyone is a fan of Bronson and would like to see him in a really good romantic role, this would be the ticket.  The movie is really good story, has a happy ending and the actors do a great job.

Very enjoyable, thanks!",1254096000,10,904,4.067796610169491

In the final shoot out his six shooter had 8 shots.
I counted them!
Happy ending all around as the boy gets a California gold claim and Bronson gets the beautiful gal!",1233446400,4,216,4.166666666666667
2414137,3,B000BD0YES,"Very interesting TV flick for all Bronson'fans, montage from an old TV show THE TRAVELS OF JAIMIE McPHEETERS (1964). If the quality of this DVD is far better than the other one (the original TV ratio 4x3 is respected), this copy suffer of a lack of sharpness. That's the fate of most of the public domain programs.

2414138,2,B000BD0YES,"If this DVD was purchased from anywhere else but a US seller, I would have said it was a poorly done pirate copy. The picture is worse than grainy, it is blotchy, the sound is extremely bad. Besides, the summary of the plot provided by Amazon is actually all wrong. Russel in this movie can not be Bronson's hero helper simply for the fact that in the movie he plays a boy of about 12-13 years! They are both much younger in the movie than the cover makes you think.

The DVD that I got was only watchable till the middle of the movie, after that the picture started dissapearing or splittering on the screen. No idea if the problem was with that particular DVD or (which is a possibility) the whole batch was badly done from some old tape.",1133827200,13,740,4.285714285714286

8085404,1,B000BD0YES,"Very disappointed! This 3 by 4 TV version is so bad it is unwatchable.  Looks like it's a poor VHS EP tape.  Don't bother. There aught to be a filmed print somewhere that could be transferred, but this one is awful.",1442016000,,215,4.219512195121951
8085405,1,B000BD0YES,"Buyers beware! This DVD is a Ripoff in the first degree! The DVD is twice as bad as the original as far as the TV screen resolution or clarity is concerned and the person or persons who are claiming it is a ""remastered version"" are basically perpetrating a fraud on the Amazon customers. When I compared the original with the so-called ""Remastered"" version, the original copy of this DVD was twice as good as the remastered product.",1429401600,4,432,4.623376623376624

8085408,5,B000BD0YES,"This is a very entertaining movie. Charles Bronson in the role of a wagon train guide plays the typical Bronson attitude. It is a Western ,but a little different from the typical. It is as much a love story where Linc Murdock unexpectedly finds his girl 5 years after he believes she has been shot by him. A lot has changed and he is intent on getting her back even though she has become married to someone she doesn't love. Maria, is a central figure in the story,and is magnificently played by  Susan Oliver. Linc  has to run into town for supplies,and takes the young lad Kurt Russell with him. He is ambushed by Maria's husband and cohorts ,which in the end results in a fight to the finish and the love of Maria. There are some very well developed characters,a good storyline,not much in the way of great landscape ,music,or even old West town setting;but it is still entertaining.
I watched this 1993,91 minute  movie in the VHS format and the picture and sound quality is excellent. While it is  entertaining and different ,it is not outstanding nor will it ever be considered a classic. However,the tender scene of Maria and Link beside the river is one seldom seen in a Western.",1417651200,,1187,4.55868544600939
