Whiel this one is less violent than the other it gives a good economic perspective on World War II. The point of the films are that soldiers alone could not win the war, instead the war machine needed the help of the american people. You get a good sense of just how much everyday people sacrificed in order for us to remain  victorious.",1153353600,,438,4.341463414634147
8159681,5,B0007A9PZO,"This film has nothing to do with corporate America at all, so the title seems weird to me but that is beside the point. What these documentaries are about is how it was not only the soldiers who won the ware but also normal people in America who sacrificed and lived under rationing and worked in the war factories to help back up the troops. Its  very inspriational and is a good alternative to the standard WWII documentary.",1148342400,,426,4.461538461538462
