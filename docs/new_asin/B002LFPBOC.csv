3946583,5,B002LFPBOC,I love this show. Wish another season would've came out. No problems with this at all. Would suggest for those who like to watch erotica or shows with lots of sex scenes.,1358467200,8,170,4.34375
3946584,5,B002LFPBOC,I loved the characters in this show. It's a travesty that it wasn't renewed. I've been watching it non-stop since I've received it and keep hoping for more. I still want more!!! Oh well.....sigh!!! Hopefully there will be a reunion of some sort. Just putting it out there.,1302307200,9,272,4.6875
3946585,2,B002LFPBOC,"This is a very boring and predictable rip off of ""Sex and the City."" I could only take 3 episodes and stopped watching altogether. I can see why it was cancelled after 2 seasons.",1284768000,4,178,4.264705882352941
3946586,5,B002LFPBOC,"I used to watch this show on Oxygen and found it to be smart, funny television. Canadians do it right! I couldn't wait for the third season and then found out that the show was canceled due to lack of funds or budget issues, either way I was crushed until I found out it was finally coming to DVD. I placed my order and couldn't wait to watch it all over again. The only thing better would have been more seasons..... I love this show!",1260230400,21,435,4.129411764705883

8372886,4,B002LFPBOC,"Wished it was in widescreen, but that's a limitation of the original show being shot in 4x3. Too bad it was cancelled at the end of Season 2, as we really loved these characters.",1479772800,,178,4.264705882352941
8372887,4,B002LFPBOC,Loved this show when it was on Oxygen so sad it didn't last. However loved the sexual tension between all the characters! Kept you the edge are they gonna or not. To add to ur sexual tension they had great sex stories for there book. Sure to make you come back for more.,1453420800,,270,4.113207547169812

8372891,5,B002LFPBOC,"I remember watching this TV series years ago when I was still living in Brazil, the storyline and the sexual tension between the two main characters. What was a pleasant surprise all over again was to realise while watching the recently bought copy (out of nostalgia), was to see how relatable and fun the characters were. Kate is the professional, sexy but uptight woman and her navigation through the murky dating world are both touching and hilarious. The highlights though, go to Adam Harrington. As the sensitive and vulnerable womanizer Benjamin, he is a show stealer. I fell in love with him and was heartbroken when the series got cancelled. If you are an American viewer like many of my friends, I'd watch it with an open mind. This show was not meant to be like Sex and The City. Yes, it is about the matters of the heart and sexuality, however, in a completely different context. And I love it.",1426809600,3,905,4.627329192546584
8372892,1,B002LFPBOC,The movie sucked!!!! A really big waste of my money!!!!!! I don't want to give it even one star.,1416960000,,96,4.105263157894737
8372893,2,B002LFPBOC,After reading all the reviews I was disappointed on what I saw on this series. Waste of my time and money,1390089600,,105,4.0476190476190474
