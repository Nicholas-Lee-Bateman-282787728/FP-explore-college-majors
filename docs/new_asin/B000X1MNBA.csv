8226540,5,B000X1MNBA,"This is a really superb film for boys who like football! The Danish have really excelled at all kinds of filmmaking, it seems, not just the art films that have created a reputation internationally. This is aimed at a young audience but can be enjoyed by anyone, the story is so well handled. The coach of the main boys' team is such an amiable guy you really root for him and his team. One of the players is his son who has rather taken against him after a separation between the parents. The boys are convincing and natural without pandering to the modern taste for vulgarity that would ruin it if it were an American or British film. For instance, the football sequences - which do not dominate too much - are seen over a Mozart opera at one high point, and later to discreet clarinet lines from Wagner. This really amazed me, and could plant a seed in the minds of the target audience so they could take up a musical instrument, perhaps, as well as play football ... Of course there is a lot of popular music as well, I'm not saying the film is like Bergman for teenagers! But it does have a great deal of sensitivity, an admirable take on a new romance for the coach with the mother of one of the team, and even shows the team wearing pink shirts, initially by mistake because he bleached them, but later deliberately because they seemed to bring them luck! I thought this was a great touch. The football sequences are shot in a lively style that covers over the budgetary constraints in terms of extras very well, and a commentary linking it to past international games works wonders for the atmosphere.",1336867200,,1608,4.454237288135594
