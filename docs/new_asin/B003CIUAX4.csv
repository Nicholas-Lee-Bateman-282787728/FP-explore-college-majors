8604137,5,B003CIUAX4,"This is not your typical shoot em' up western.  It's not a Cowboy vs Indian or range war type movie.  It's a gritty little western that deals with two people, one good one not so good and the obstacles they overcome as they escape across the barren desert.
The movie is worthy of 5 stars in my book but the indoors and nighttime scenes are a little to dark in this print. Daytime scenery  looks very good and the colors are just fine. The New Mexican landscapes are captured beautifully by Charles F Wheeler.  The Indian ruins & cliff dwelling scenes are hauntingly etched in my mind three days after watching this for the first time.  The two leads (Vera & Sam)  are very good in their roles.  John Anderson is good as Vera's tormented husband/sheriff. Can't forget Cynthia Myers. She only has a few scenes but her lines are convincing and show she was more than a pretty face. Btw this is a 16x9 copy. Definitely could use  a re-mastering.  If you are looking for a different type western and can overlook the flaws in this print, pull the trigger, grab the popcorn and enjoy.",1429747200,,1078,4.459183673469388
