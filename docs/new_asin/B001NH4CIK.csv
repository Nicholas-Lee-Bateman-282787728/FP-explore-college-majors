8326967,5,B001NH4CIK,"This DVD package contains Petrucciani's solo piano concert at the 1996 jazz festival in Marciac, France, as well as the 1983 short film about Michel that features footage of him playing with Charles Lloyd and Lee Konitz in Paris.  Lastly, there are interesting, if brief, interviews with Michel's father Tony and drummer-collaborator Aldo Romano, but for much more in depth information about the pianist's life, his Wikipedia profile would be a good place to start.  The opening three tune medley, ""My Favorite Songs,"" will blow you away, and from there its simply jazz piano brilliance sustained.  Michel Petrucciani died three years after this concert in 1999 at the age of just 36, and left a recorded legacy that will forever stand the test of time.  He proved that determination and talent can overcome just about any obstacle.",1488153600,,832,5.0510948905109485
