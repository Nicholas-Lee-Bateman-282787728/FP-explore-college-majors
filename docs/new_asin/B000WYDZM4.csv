8226054,2,B000WYDZM4,"As a long time practitioner of Xingyi I have found this DVD to be a useful reference. However the performance of the forms is more that of a wushu/dance performance. Much of modern martial arts instruction has gone in two directions that in many ways are contradictory: performance vs fighting. The performance of Xingyi should be direct and powerful, with out extraneous flourishes. This performace has many flourishes. Neither of these performers are specialists in Xingyi, they each practice a wider range of arts. Much of that range of knowledge is evident in their movement. Tony Chen is far better then Helen Liang in expressing the art of xingyi and his weapon of choice. Both have made choices in their physical body structure that if practiced without understanding could lead to injury. Still this does not invalidate the basic shape and application of either of them. Add this to your collection, but do not expect this to give you a complete taste of Xingyi movement and weapons use.",1251849600,,995,4.928571428571429
8226055,1,B000WYDZM4,"It is quite a shame that they have such world class martial artists and they waste the talent. Let's start off with the DVD itself. The menu doesn't work and you have have to go through each section to reach the section you want. As to its contents, it is more of a demonstration and actual instructional. What you get in this dvd is multiple demonstrations of the xing yi sword by various performers. There is no narration about the fine points of movement, nor is there any slow motion. For anyone with no prior background it would be a complete waste. For anyone with background and hoping to learn more, it would not provide any pointers that will improve one's learning. Although marketed as an instructional dvd is is merely a demonstration. Honestly, you will be much better off buying a dvd or vcd from china on the same topic with english subtitles. They are more detailed in presenting each action, they will break it down and point out the subtleties. Plus you more than likely pay much less (10$ and more). All in all, it is quite a disappointment and you will do much better with other dvds from china that are out there. Quite a waste of the talent of the performers.",1231200000,,1181,4.497674418604651
