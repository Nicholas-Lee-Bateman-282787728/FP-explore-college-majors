8536063,5,B00951GCCU,"This miniseries is excellent and the extensive praise from online reviewers as well as the KBS drama awards speak for themselves. However, it is very difficult to acquire a legitimate release of this miniseries, as there is currently no officially licensed American (region 1) release. While there are many bootlegged ""all region"" releases of this show, I would advise against purchasing them, for the reasons provided below. Currently the best available release of this show is the official region 3 KBS media version (which I recently purchased). Here are the highlights of this version as compared to the bootlegged versions:

1. SUBTITLES: The KBS release has very good subtitles with basically good grammar. The translators take some liberties (more than I would like), but the sense of what is being said is always communicated. The bootlegged versions have terrible, practically unintelligible subtitles with horrible grammar and which often fail to communicate what the characters are actually saying.

2. PICTURE QUALITY: The KBS release has perfect picture quality, whereas the bootlegged versions have very poor quality, with many scenes (particularly action scenes) terribly pixelated.

3. SOUND QUALITY: The KBS release has perfect sound quality, whereas some (though not all) of the bootlegged versions have very bad sound.

4. ASPECT RATIO: The KBS release has the standard 16:9 aspect ratio, whereas the bootlegged versions cut the edges off the picture, loosing that much from every shot. (For those who are not aware, Chuno was especially praised by critics for its brilliant cinematography. This is one show where keeping the original aspect ratio is an absolute must.)

5. PACKAGING: Not an extremely important point, but for those who are interested, the KBS release is professionally packaged with a total of nine discs (3 episodes per disc and one disc of bonus features) packaged in four separate cases which come together in the box covering. The bootlegged releases typically have only six discs (4 episodes per disc) and are bunched together in a single case.

For those wishing to buy the best release of this fantastic miniseries, I would strongly recommend purchasing the region 3 KBS release. Bear in mind of course that region 3 DVDs do not work on region 1 DVD players. It would be nice if there were an officially licensed region 1 release of this show, but the ""all region"" bootlegged versions are, in my opinion, not worth it.",1401580800,4,2462,5.157894736842105
8536064,5,B00951GCCU,"Excellent series, excellent subtitles! The cinematography is breathtaking and action sequences are brilliantly choreographed and executed. If you ever wondered whether watching someone run could be a beautiful thing to behold, you will find an affirmative answer here.

An excellent gift for both the veteran KDrama lover and the beginner who keeps asking what the big deal is about this dangerously addictive form of entertainment! NB: This particular set is a Region 3 DVD so you will have to either buy a multiregion player or set your laptop DVD player to region 3.",1359936000,,569,5.118279569892473
