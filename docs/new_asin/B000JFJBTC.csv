8480265,5,B000JFJBTC,"Owning many surf flicks this one I have to tip my hat to.  It combines the gratuitous shots of the Northshore and Oz with something rarely shown, the Northeast.  Groms and Vets of the NY surfing scene showing off local talent.  As surfers we would love to be surfing perfect glass in a tropical local, but for many of us thats only for surf trips.  This video combines the reality that most of surf everyday with waves we would like to surfing.  The  music showcases local vibes and flows with the footage.  Definitely a cure for surfing wanderlust.",1209081600,,549,4.540816326530612
