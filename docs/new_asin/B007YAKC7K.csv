The band had this professionally filmed, but I'll warn you now that the performance is terrible.
Page was so strung out by this stage that any solo, long or short was so sloppy that it was embarrassing. Plant's voice continually cracks and hurts the ears.
They did put on some great shows during this tour even when they were erratic. Sadly, this Seattle 1977 gig is possibly the worst I've heard by any band.
Zep are my fave band ever. The only reason I've reviewed this is to warn any curious casual fan so that they don't get put off by this performance so much that they judge Zep on this performance alone. There are loads of great live Zep performances out there on audio, especially from pre-72.",1352160000,4,805,4.52054794520548
