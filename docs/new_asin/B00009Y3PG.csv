7994237,3,B00009Y3PG,"Due to the scarcity of Pasolini's early films (beyond Criterion's release of ""Mamma Roma"") in any acceptable quality on a Region 1/A DVD or Blu-Ray, it's an item you're gonna have to live with until we get a better release. The special features are the same on every disc (a documentary that can be easily found on Youtube when one searches ""Pasolini""), there is no skipping ability, and the subtitles are almost totally faded in certain instances (""The Hawks and the Sparrows"" is a perfect example of this). All in all, it's a box set only for those who desperately want to seek out Pasolini's features, but my advice to those people, watch them on Amazon Prime. They're all duplicates of this DVD release.",1520208000,,707,4.709677419354839
7994238,1,B00009Y3PG,"Terrible to watch, the images are all faded out. There is a much better version GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW, 2007 colorized version by Legend Films, Santa Monica, CA : Distributed by Genius Entertainment, c2007. I'm sorry I bought this version. That said, the Gospel has its moments of brilliance on an apparently very small budget. The opening scene of the Madonna (in the color version) is wonderful (its pretty much lost in the black and white faded version) and the specific quotes of Jesus are very, very poignant (can't think of a better word). These poignant words make this one of the best Jesus movies.",1492646400,,615,4.811320754716981
7994239,4,B00009Y3PG,"Great films- subtitle nightmare.  Only for an artist of Pasolini's talent would I subject my eyes to the torture of trying to read the terrible English subtitles that Water Bearer has given these wonderful films!  I did figure out a way to slightly improve this problem by going to menu on my remote control, selecting picture and decreasing the brightness and backlight.  5+ stars for Pasolini!  One star for Water Bearer.  Raro Video did a fine job with ""La Rabbia"" as did Criterion wih Pasolini's  ""Trilogy of Life,"" and his shocker ""Salo.""",1437609600,3,543,4.8478260869565215
7994240,5,B00009Y3PG,"just watch these, give them a try they are like greek plays and simply great there is not another director who had this mans talent and i like these art films which is what it implies art",1358380800,,187,4.081081081081081
7994241,1,B00009Y3PG,"I concur with Scott Richardson's comments, though it would be helpful to give this item a one-star rating to reflect how poor a job the fly-by-night Water Bearer company has done with this release.  (To say the least, I'm not giving the actual films by Pasolini one star; the greatness of the films is the _reason_ this shoddy product should receive one star.)  The picture/transfer quality is mediocre, and it is so ridiculous (not merely inconvenient, but _lazy_ and unhelpful to close study of these films) to not include chapter index points.  Let me emphasize: you CANNOT SKIP THROUGH THE MOVIE: if you hit the forward ""skip"" button on your control, the movie begins all over again.  _If_ it's true that the Pasolini Foundation requested that chapters be removed---and I cannot remember ever seeing a DVD inhibited this way---then they should just go all the way and only allow the films to be available on 16mm reels for home viewing.  Or better yet, just seal them all in a vault so that people can only remember/talk about them.  Except that _memory_ includes a ""skip"" function.

And also, at least on two different-model DVD players I used, the fast-forward (shuttle) option doesn't work well with these discs.  (Though it works fine with all other DVDs.)

Just to emphasize the problems with the transfers, let me take one example; I should mentioned that a number of times during the wonderful ACCATONE, with its gorgeous B&W photography; you can see a horizontal, distorted line---like a ""warp"" in the image---travel from the bottom to the top of the screen.  This isn't a flaw in the DVD; it almost seems that the DVD transfer was from a flawed videotape, and nobody bothered to watch the final DVD image before they pressed and released the product.

Finally, and perhaps most egregious, Water Bearer hasn't bothered to use decently formatted subtitles.  They are not optional---you can't turn them off, if you happen to know Italian, or if you'd like to re-experience the movie without the distraction of subtitles---and they are in an non-outlined white that becomes almost completely invisible when the compositions of the films (especially B&W film) provide a white or light-colored background to the subtitles.  This is absolutely ridiculous, and convinces me that the crooks at Water Bearer don't watch the products that they ask us to pay for.  Do they even particularly care about cinema at Water Bearer, or is it a cheap identity-politics/niche-market game?  How much more would it cost to simply DO THIS JOB RIGHT?  So, to reiterate, if you don't know Italian and _need_ the subtitles, you won't be able to read them easily or at all for long stretches of time; if you know Italian, and would like the subtitles optionally, you _won't_ be able to turn them off.  Based on their Pasolini issues, I'd say Water Bearer are amateurs who operate without competence or ethics.  Not every independent/foreign/art film distributor needs to operate at the standards of the Criterion Collection, but Water Bearer should be ridiculed out of business for dragging Pasolini through the mud.  Better to just downloaded these films illegally.  Shame on the Pasolini Foundation, or whoever passes out licenses, for caring so little about the master's legacy; at least in N. America, where Pasolini's style and his messages and his complexity are perhaps more badly needed than anywhere else in the world, still.  The life of this complicated, flawed, thoughtful, dissident, humane filmmaker deserves better than a shoddy money-grab.",1309046400,13,3540,5.037735849056604
7994242,4,B00009Y3PG,"Unfortunately, Waterbearer didn't correct any of the problems that plagued their first set of Pasolini DVD's: the transfers are all sub-par, with burned-in subtitles (that are sometimes very wrong: did you know that one of the ten commandments is ""thou shalt not steel""?) and no chapter stops.  The discs are overpriced, especially considering that, despite what it says on the back of the case, none of the discs appear to have undergone any restoration whatsoever.
Pasolini was a master filmmaker, and it's a shame that only one of his films (The Decameron) has a quality Region 1 release. The others (the six released by Waterbearer and Vanguard's release of Medea) are poor transfers that simply don't do justice to this great man's life work.
For now, however, Pasolini fans stuck in Region 1 (I understand superior editions of most of his films exist in Region 2) are limited to these sub-par releases.  If you're a Pasolini fan, I'd advise you to buy the discs used, because what Waterbearer's asking for these discs is ridiculous.",1075593600,57,1038,4.959770114942529
7994243,5,B00009Y3PG,"This three-film box set includes Pasolini's exceptional debut film (ACCATTONE), his first masterpiece - one of the greatest films I have seen (THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW), plus his controversial political fable (THE HAWKS AND THE SPARROWS). I have written about these DVDs individually elsewhere at Amazon.com. Each disc includes the same half-hour 1970 documentary on Pasolini, but no other features. The Pasolini Foundation in Rome, which controls all rights to these films, supplied the prints: good quality for ACCATTONE and HAWKS but not for THE GOSPEL (my Amazon review offers a suggestion on how to adjust your TV to make it look better). The Pasolini Foundation also had the U.S. distributor release the DVDs without any chapters (i.e., in one continuous track), to encourage people to watch each picture in its entirety. Despite those limitations, all these films are very much worth seeing.",1070064000,20,909,5.275862068965517
