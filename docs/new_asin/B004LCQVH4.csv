8434232,5,B004LCQVH4,"This DVD set is amazing! I've been in the special effects industry for 15 years and I have never come across a video series this informative. From the beginning lifecast to the internal mechanisms to the styling of the animatron's hair, its literally all here in fantastic detail. I would have paid twice, no, three times the selling price for this product. I completely recommend this item, and I am a very hard sell. The video completely takes the guess work, trial and error, and fits of rage out of the process. I love this DVD series.",1323820800,2,539,4.56701030927835
