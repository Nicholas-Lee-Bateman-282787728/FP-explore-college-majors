8274759,1,B0019N5PP2,"Fyre (Richard Grand, 1979)

Fyre was one of the first movies I added to my Netflix queue when we re-subscribed in 2011 after deciding to cut the cord. I no longer remember how I ran across it. Then I didn't get round to actually watching it until I got the little notification on my queue that it was going away in a week. Not watching turned out to be the right choice. Fyre was the only film Richard Grand ever directed on his own; he has not worked in Hollywood since 1979, at least not according to IMDB. Easy to see why. Fyre is relentlessly depressing, badly-acted, badly-shot, and plotless, a character study that is warranted neither by the actress portraying the character (Lynn Theel, too, would have an abbreviated Hollywood career) nor the character herself. While it's not as bad as some movies I've seen along these linesunlike, for example, the godawful Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me, at least Fyre never attempts to pass itself off as a comedybut it's still pretty dire. * ",1407283200,,1000,4.55
