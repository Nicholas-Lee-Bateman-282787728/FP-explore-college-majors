3714938,5,B000P0ZAJG,"I would love a tape or DVD of John Leguizamo in this one-man show.  I took a date to see it on stage in Chicago (before Blue Man Group took over that venue) and I really came close to incontinence I was laughing so hard.  He was truly brilliant and fearless.  I thought the show's name was a bit controversial, but looking around maybe half the audiance was Latino, and they were (needless to say) laughing their asses off with me. It came not many months after Lily Tomlin's ""In Search of..."" and I thought Leguizamo (who was not that well-known then) was every bit as brilliant as she. High praise indeed.  Now I want to see it, so re-issue it, please.",1277596800,2,654,4.336065573770492
3714939,4,B000P0ZAJG,"I first saw this comedy special on Comedy Central in the late 90's and have been wanting to own it ever since.  A friend of mine taped it off tv and we watched it constantly, even with the poor edits.  From the look of Spic-O-Rama, it looks like it came out either before or after Leguizamo's short lived sketch comedy show, House of Buggin'.

In the hilarious Spic-O-Rama, Leguizamo portrays all the members in his ""fictional"" family from his two brothers (""This is my brother, Crazy Willie.  We call him crazy cause he is."") to both of his parents.  The whole performance begins as a class project about Miguelito's family and moves into a sketch about each family member.  The best sketch is the one about the matriarch of the family.  (""No this is not hair weave, this is hair fusion."")  Leguizamo dons the drag and rocks it, way before Too Wong Foo, as the feisty latina mother.

This is a great comedy special that totally needs to be on dvd as it is virtually impossible to find on video (for those of you still rocking a vcr).  At this point, I'd take it on video if it means I could watch it again.
