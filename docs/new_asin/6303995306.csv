752163,5,6303995306,"This film is as significant as it is delightful because it is even more relevant today than in the 1970s.  Today, most of Europe is populated by immigrant workers from all parts of the continent and Africa.  And there is still the same kind of pecking order (those of you who've seen the film forgive that pun!): The Swiss look down on Italians, North Italians look down on Southern Italians, they in turn look down on Turks etc. The film bravely laughs at all our cultural flaws and salutes them.
And Nino Manfredi... what a gem!  Part Charlie Chaplin and part Marcello Mastroianni, he's a wonderful blend of pathos and sweetness with just the right drop of vulgarity.
BUT...!  Be forewarned, the DVD is the worst I've ever seen!  The print they transferred is FULL of scratches, pops, and splices that chop off whole sentences.  The light scenes are often washed out and the dark scenes are far too dark.  And there are a number of occasions where the subtitles were lost in the white background.  I can't imagine that they couldn't find a decent print of this film anywhere.  Still, if you can't find a rental copy anywhere, it's still better to have even this awful version than no version at all.",1028592000,59,1201,4.60093896713615
752164,5,6303995306,"This is one of my favorite films because it is multi-layered and rich. It makes me laugh, it fills me with sadness and it makes me think. An exquisite comedy, full of historical, social and philosophical implications, it is characterized by creative directing, wonderful acting, engaging cinematography and a great script. Buy it!",1014422400,17,330,5.245283018867925
752165,5,6303995306,"Although all performances are beautifully done, Nino Manfredi demonstrates an awesome level of acting skill that draws the audience into the midst of his trials and laughable tribulations.
  The best comment I ever read by a reviewer of this film (many years ago)was: ""You'll laugh 'til your heart breaks.""
  And so it goes.  Don't miss it!!!",997142400,17,342,5.035714285714286
752166,2,6303995306,"BREAD:  funny at points, the main actor was a sensitive and sympathetic character...at first at least...  also the portrayal of a a man out of his country, out of his element struck a symbolic chord in me (= a person not at home in him/herself, not on a connected path, a lost soul out of joint)
CHOCOLATE:  the character went too far at being comedic and became a buffoon, so that it was hard to empathize with him...and at that point the story lost its symbolic strength.  also, by the plot going over the top, becoming too wild and absurd, it lost its simple power and just became dull, frankly.
i couldn't finish watching it.",982368000,3,629,4.443478260869565
752167,5,6303995306,"About an Italian immigrant worker in Switzerland.  Through almost no fault of his own, things keep going from bad to worse, but he perserves through it all.  Enjoyable for 12 years and up, won't hurt younger viewers.",911952000,9,216,4.8108108108108105
752236,5,6303995306,"I had heard about Bread & Chocolate for some years and was not even a glimmer in my mother's eye when it was originally released. It takes an honest, humorous and poignant look at the experience of Italian immigrants in Switzerland who came seeking work even in the face of discrimination and hardship. The main character (Nino Manfredi) is a waiter-in-training at a high class restaurant vying for the coveted job of waiter with his Turkish rival. Both Turks and Italians are horribly discriminated against in Switzerland. He must keep a stiff upper lip while he is missing his wife and children. Nino encounters Elena (Anna Karina), his beautiful and reclusive Greek neighbor with secrets of her own. He also must take life as it comes to him when he takes on work with an Italian compatriot he encounters at the restaurant and comes to find all is not what it seems about this man, even in the face of tremendous affluence and potential opportunity for Nino.

The acting is superb, the comedy is fast and furious and the music is beautiful. In some ways, much of the state of Europe has remained the same even in the face of the European Euro. Discrimination and extremes in wealth and poverty are alive and well. This film beautifully examines these themes and more. I won't lie. It was not an easy film to watch. In some ways, it is gut wrenching. It seems the more the lead character tries to fit in and stay in Switzerland, in spite of nearly being deported a few times, the less he is able to assimilate in the culture he attempts to adopt. Intriguing look at the effect of immigration in the face of identity and human behavior.",1379030400,5,1637,4.587030716723549
752237,4,6303995306,I had seen this film when it first came out and I wanted to share it with my children.  Still funny and timely.  The culture clash between the Italians and the Swiss is at the heart of the drama.  There are many references to other filmmakers and works that I didn't get until I viewed this again.  There is some hilarious slapstick as well.  Fine acting and visually beautiful.,1371772800,2,378,4.420289855072464
752238,5,6303995306,"Nino Manfredi at his best ! At the time, he should have got an Oscar nomination. This is the Italian emigration of the '50 :the way we were, not the way we are.",1366761600,,160,3.878787878787879
752239,2,6303995306,"The quality of the DVD was grainy and he sound quality poor. This was worse than one would expect from an original master. The film tself represented the contrast between the well off swiss (chocolate) and the italian and turkish working class (bread) just working to survive. It is classified as a comedy. I would call it a tragedy. The Haydn quartet - opus 3 number 5 - the serenade, provides a wonderfully appropriate theme musical background.",1249430400,4,446,4.805194805194805
752240,5,6303995306,This is a great little movie that has a lot of heart. I agree with the reviewer who was deeply moved by the chicken coup scene. I have not seen this movie for more than 25 years but that scene stuck with me too. The concept of alien workers forced to leave their homeland to earn a living wage is unfortunately very much a reality today. It is my hope that  watching this movie would help soften the hearts of people who are worried that good jobs are being lost to foreign workers.,1240704000,,482,4.182795698924731
752241,2,6303995306,i bought this for 2 reasons because NINO MANFREDI made a ITALIAN SONG that i liked very much and the other because my friend had seen it 35 years ago and he said he liked it .after watching it i found it so so maybe because i have trouble liking italian mvies even though i am ITALIAN.last to say if i was brought in ITALY i would have enjoyed the film  better,1229040000,,360,4.0
752242,4,6303995306,"An uneducated Italian man tries to find new landscapes of hopes and illusions seeking work in Switzerland,. But sometimes what you seek and what you find don't coincide.

A cult movie in many art houses around the world and certainly one of the amusing but devastating films around this delicate and terrible drama about the inner immigrants.",1200009600,,342,5.0
752243,5,6303995306,"The humour and lonliness of the mid life journey is so wonderfully portrayed here.  ""At least when you lose, you get to have a rest.""

An unexpected surprise to find this one.  Don't worry about about missing a few of the subtitles, this movie is too good to miss.",1174003200,3,264,4.346938775510204

752245,4,6303995306,"While the movie is delightful, this DVD should have been condemned. The titles are unreadable 30 to 40% of the time. What slappdash work on a good movie. The producers should be ashamed.",1045008000,40,186,4.666666666666667

7858348,1,6303995306,"My low rating is solely because of the low quality of this DVD. The Hen's Tooth Video DVD has very poor subtitles - about 1/4 of the dialogue is not subtitled, and sometimes the subtitles cannot be read against a white background on screen. This really hurts the comedic punch of the movie. I wish I had not bought this DVD. There is an Italian Blu-ray available that looks like a much better viewing experience.",1489104000,,412,4.506666666666667

It is a very funny movie while dealing with serious social issues.  It makes you laugh, but you feel guilty.  There are some human situations that are very amusing.  It is a very well done movie and Nino Manfredi is very endearing.",1447027200,3,376,3.96

7858354,5,6303995306,"Great movie (to me... of course..). Can't find it anywhere (and I have lots of sources), so bought this commercial VHS copy on Amazon, via an independent merchant. Tape played just fine. Transferred it to Blu-Ray and watched it last night, for the first time in ages.  The bottom line is that there were no technical glitches to impede enjoying the full movie, so I can't ask any more than that, especially for a film that is just darn near impossible to get.",1399766400,2,459,4.530120481927711

7858356,4,6303995306,"I first saw this in the theater in 1979, and it has been a favorite foreign film ever since. However, the quality of the print used for both the VHS and the DVD is disappointing and several subtitles are simply missing altogether. When the titles are present, they are sometimes unreadable due to a white background. Also, a couple of times the picture suddenly changes as though there are frames missing. Somebody PLEASE restore this film !!",1386115200,5,442,4.753246753246753
