1691652,5,B000063TQS,"i don't know if i would call this the best season, but it is definitely the best series that i've ever seen.  i luved this particular season (i own the other two also).  the situations that these ladies find themselves in--and how they get themselves out, is hilarious, in a comforting and famaliar way.  i would recommend this to the all the loyal watchers of the show, and also to anyone who loves sex, the city, women, or any combination of the above!",1017792000,,454,4.445783132530121
1691653,5,B000063TQS,"Thank God.....finally.  This is by far the best season.  I have this season on VHS, which I recorded while it was on air.  And I played it to death.  The guest appearances (Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alanis Morissette, and etc.), Samantha's funky tasting spunk... experience, Carrie sleeping with a then married Big while in a relationship with Aidan, Charlotte getting married (ALRIGHTY), and Miranda being her bitter self. You got to get it.  If you already have season 1&2, please add this to your collection.  Because as you know, if anyone was watching the Barbara Walters special with Sarah Jessica Parker before the 74th Oscars, they will be pulling the plug on our favorite television show soon....",1017187200,5,702,5.008620689655173
1691654,5,B000063TQS,"Sex and the City is one of my favorite shows and the third season is a very good with standout episodes like ""Running With Scissors"" and ""No Ifs ands or Butts."" The Carrie/Big relationship evolves, Carrie meets Aidan, Charlotte finds a husband and Samantha is Samantha. This dvd is well worth your money",1016928000,6,303,4.735849056603773
1691655,5,B000063TQS,"I love Sex and the City.  SJP has said on many occasions that the city is the 5th lady.  I agree.  The show is shot in the most beautiful place in the world. (can you tell I am a native?)So, it's fitting that the cast reflects the beauty of the city. I love the wonderful writing and the complexity of the characters. It's shows like this that remind the female population that being single isn't a crime and you can be young, sexual and a professional without feeling like maybe the clock is ticking.  I have my current boy friend so hooked, that I think that he has watched the DVD's more than I have. I own the first two seasons and love them. I agree with the others that the third is better than the first two. And I sure can't wait for the 4th to be released. So Enjoy city dwellers and always remember, you might find your own, Mr. Big....",1016582400,86,846,4.171779141104294
1691656,5,B000063TQS,If you have never seen Sex and the City you better act now. This is the best Woman show I have ever watched. This is really about how Women are and what we are thinking about. This DVD should be great. I have season 1 and 2 and can't wait to add season 3 to my collection.,1016496000,17,272,3.789473684210526
1691657,5,B000063TQS,"This past season (the fourth season) was chiefly Carrie and the gang growing up -- facing some of the consequences of their actions.  Reflecting on the third season, you can see the seeds beginning to take root.  Essentially, the first season laid the groundwork for the show, the second season was excellent, but the third season finds the writers doing a little experimenting -- something more than sex talk and shopping.  Big's marriage, Carrie's relationship with Aidan (for once, a nice guy!!), Charlotte's marriage, and Miranda's relationship with Steve all show the writers gaining momentum, constantly willing to suprise it's viewers.  Frankly, this show only gets better and better. . .",1016496000,6,695,5.2342342342342345
1691658,4,B000063TQS,"The first and second seasons of the HBO hit 'Sex and the city' experienced great success on the DVD market and this is attributed to a number of reasons.
It is fabulous to see a show that deals with the taboo, the untalked about world of sex and how this world is personified by a number of lovable protagonists. Yes, in order to completely enjoy the show a certain degree of belief must be suspended. I mean these girls have sex every night, talk about it all day and Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is able to afford an enormous shoe library despite the fact she is a writer; It is here though that the show creates a lot of it's charm. 'Sex and the city' deals with the extensions of the world of sex. The rude, shocking, embarrassing and often things that are left behind closed doors. And the audience is allowed to laugh at it... why? BECAUSE IT'S NOT US! Thank god we needn't worry about the things Carrie and the gang has to, if it were not in fact fictitious the show would seem quite odd!
The third season was the exemplification of the issues brought to the forefront in the first 2 seasons. It can be seen that more risks were taken in the 3rd series. Each and every year 'Sex and the city' pushes the boundaries of what is socially acceptable, or allowed to be talked about. There are also some fantastic guest star roles in the 3rd season that include Sarah Michelle Geller and Vince Vaughan to name a few.
The DVD transfer of the first two seasons was faultless. It's great to see a show you love unedited, without ad breaks and no waiting 'til next week. The features included are also fabulous. So buy the third season, sit back, relax and enjoy the wildness and political incorrectness that the wonderfully crafted 'Sex and the city' bring to the forefront.",1016409600,,1773,4.441717791411043
1691659,5,B000063TQS,"I became hooked in the middle of the second season and bought the first & second season on dvd. After having HBO added to my cable line-up; specifically to watch Sex & The City, I can attest to the fact that the third season is Fabulous. Some of the episodes were hard to watch as Carrie repeatedly breaks down the only good relationship she's ever had. But the guest stars, trip to LA episodes, Samantha falling in love, & Miranda's pregnancy are not to be missed!
I've preordered this dvd set and if you're a fan of the show you'll want to as well...",1016409600,4,552,4.3173076923076925
1691660,5,B000063TQS,"I am so excited that this season has been released!  It is the most well-written (and acted) of all of the seasons.  The first two seasons were just appetizers, but this season is the main course.
...
Watch and find out!  The season is full of cameos including: Vince Vaughn, Carrie Fisher, Alanis Morrisette, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Hugh Hefner, and more!  This is the best show on TV!!  This is the season of more, more, more.  Kick back, relax and enjoy!!!",1015718400,13,458,4.592592592592593
1691661,5,B000063TQS,"I HAVE THE FIRST AND THE SECOND SEASON, I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SEASON BUT I THINK THAT IT'S GONNA BE BETTER THAN THE FIRST AND THE SECOND, BECAUSE THE FIRST WAS GREAT AND THE SECOND WAS MUCH BETTER.
I LIVE IN PERU AND THEY DON'T PLAY SEX AND THE CITY HERE, BUT LET ME TELL YOU THAT THIS LAST DECEMBER 31ST I SAW THE HBO SEX AND THE CITY MARATHON FROM THE FOURTH SEASON AND I COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER NEW YEAR'S EVE I ONLY WEN'T TO  THE PARTY ONLY ONE HOUR TO RECIVE THE YEAR AND THEN I WENT BACK TO MY ROOM TO SEE MORE OF SEX AND THE CITY.
IF YOU HAD NEVER SEEN SEX AND YHE CITY I SUGGEST TO STAR FROM THE FIRST SEASON TO UNDERSTAND IT.
THIS IS THE BEST SERIE EVER, IS ONE IS BEYOND ALL THAT STUFF LIKE FRIENDS OR THREE SISTER OR SPIN CITY AND ALSO BETTER THAN THE  SOPRANOS WICH IS GREAT.",1015632000,8,784,3.8333333333333335

Carrie made me want to vomit.",1498780800,2,170,4.28125
1691663,5,B000063TQS,"I thought that this season was really good. The fashion has been improving, the humor is still there, and it had some great drama. I thought that the thing with Carrie, Aidan, and Mr. Big was a pretty good feel for drama and tension, and there were moments that really had me nervous. Overall, great season of a great show!",1498694400,,323,4.4

1691669,2,B000063TQS,"This show has some funny moments. The one obnoxious thing i have a hard time with are all the bloody fur coats. In a day and age of more and more cool, hip, young people who embrace animal welfare, the women in the show seem very old fashioned and tacky. Lets face it, they are nuts, and very little about the whole show is realistic. It is more like the fantasy of a queenie gay guy, whose mom was probably a fur wearing overly made up woman. Some of the dialogues can be funny, but that is about it.",1490054400,,501,4.070707070707071

In this season, I feel the ladies are seriously just determined to whore it up, and not learn any serious life lessons along the way, which leads the viewer kind of stumped as to why they're watching still. I'm going to give it a shot, and keep watching hoping that all seasons are not as bad as this one. The episode that dealt with gender fluidity, and had Carrie falling in bed with a guy who had so many different partners (men and women alike) had me screaming that they could have emphasized that she used protection, but they didn't. It leads me to wonder if she did? That's where I thought to myself, this has AIDS written all over it. Why am I still watching?",1466812800,,844,4.416666666666667

1693003,3,B000063TQS,"I'm a writer & poet as a hobby, and once I found Sex & the City was offered on Amazon Prime, I decided to watch it to check out the storylines & see what all the raves & hoopla (AND criticism) was all about when Season-1 aired back in June-Aug 1998.  I'm now up to Mid-Season-3, and admit I'm not very happy about the storylines since the start of Season-1, but I'll start with what I do like about these four women & work my way into what I DON'T like about them; & their choices of men.

  First off, all four women are well-educated, independent, have admirable careers, and expensive taste in choosing apartments, clothes, shoes, & interior decor. Carrie writes the newspaper column ""Sex & the City"", Charlotte runs an Art Gallery, Miranda is an Attorney who makes Partner by the early part of Season-3, and Samantha runs a Public Relations firm.  From Season 1-to-Season-2, Carrie & Charlotte appear to be wanting to find ""Mr. Right"" to marry.

  Miranda starts out acting like she wants to find Mr. Right, but by the time you get to Season-3, you can clearly see that she's used to enjoying her independence, is not too interested in having any serious commitments, is focused on her career now that shes made Partner in her law firm, & starts to aggressively assert the demand to ""have her own space"" away from her lovable but slightly immature man, Steve (what man isnt?)---to the point where I actually felt sorry for the poor guy by the end of Season-2.  Another problem Miranda has is she doesnt show any interest in, nor emotional support for, the hobbies & things that make Steve happywhich certainly wouldnt kill her to do for Steve if she wasn't so self-centered.

  Granted, Steve is a Bartender who obviously doesnt make the kind of income Miranda earns (making her the breadwinner), but he IS sincere, monogamous, very romantic, wants a serious relationship with Miranda, and had no problem being the first to say I love you and REALLY MEAN IT---which is what should have made Miranda happy IF she was really looking for a committed relationship like she was portraying herself as wanting in the beginning to her girlfriends.  In the real-world, women often make more money than their husbands.  I grew up around women who made more money than their husbands; and their households prospered because they were able to afford everything they needed & wanted.

  So suffice it to say, that it is extremely important for a wife to have her own careercompletely separate from the husbands income.  It also keeps the husband from getting emotionally abusive in wanting to cage the wife up in the house like a prisoner while he runs amuck enjoying HIS freedom.  However, Darren Star & these HBO writers wrote the character Miranda up to go overboard & end up with a really flawed attitude about HER emotional & financial independence in her relationship with Steve.  So when she shouldve been more easy-going & enjoying the differences between her & Steve, she instead used those differences to drive a wedge between them---and sabotaged the bulk of the relationship instead of trying to give-and-take like in any normal relationship.  I myself wanted a Steve-like guy, and I could have made it work with open-communication & dialogue, but at the end of the day, Mirandas character was just too selfish to really want to do that.

  Samantha thinks like a horny man, is extremely free with her sexuality & will try anything once.  She's never in a relationship longer than a few weeks tops because the kinds of guys she dates are only interested in getting one thing.

  However, it all blows up in her face in Season-3, when Samantha gets a horrible case of the Flu & can't get one---not one single man to come to her Apt for just a 1/2 hour-to-45-minutes to help put up a curtain rod that fell while she was terribly sick to where her eyes needed to avoid painful sunlight.  She ends up on the phone cussing many of them out in disgust due to their insensitive reactions to her illness & situation.  Thus proving to all of us viewers just what kind of guys she's been intimately involved with throughout her adult life: males who are just about getting laid & nothing else, guys with low-class mentalities.  It was a pitiful sight to see her sick & mistreated like that.  But still, a conservative-society would not consider Samantha to be a decent woman, due to all the bad choices she constantly makes in men & because all she cares about is sex.

  Carrie, the sex-columnist, clearly smokes way too much.  She's a regular walking billboard for early-onset cancer to the point where I couldn't breathe just watching her after awhile!  From the beginning, Carrie desires a committed relationship & marriage, but goes about pursuing it all wrong with this adorable, handsome, yet extremely selfish & terrified-of-commitment divorcee theyve dubbed Mr. Big.  She unfortunately gets involved intimately too-soon with Mr. Big.  Once she does, Carrie spends the rest of her time in the relationship pulling her hair out trying to get this handsome moron to commit to her, and instead he ends up being sent to Paris on a job assignment & decides to end things with Carrie while there, by getting engaged in Paris & then flying back to the States to marry this tall pretty model---smashing Carries heart to a million pieces.

  But instead of Darren Star & HBOs writers making a positive story out of this to show that Carrie learns from this experience to create a solid, loving relationship with her new beau Aidan, a talented Carpenter, they decide to ridiculously write this up where Mr. Big selfishly starts pursuing Carrie soon after his marriage!  And instead of Carrie staying away from him permanently, she actually, insanely, gives in to Big & has a sordid affair with him---all behind the back of the real-man Aidan, whos been treating her like a Queen, wants to marry her, & helped her to almost stop smoking completely!  By Season-3 Episode-12, Carrie stupidly confesses her affair with Big to Aidan right after Carolines wedding to Trey, instead of keeping her mouth shut; and a devastated Aidan ends their relationship on the spot!

I was so thoroughly disgusted at that point that I almost stopped watching the series, because I couldn't believe how these HBO writers wrote Carrie up like an overgrown immature schoolgirl in her 30s with no common sense & no self-respect.  It was a disgrace to write Carrie up to be that stupid to resume an intimate relationship with a man that went & married another woman instead of her & is now unhappy for it, because thats a very negative impression to give teenage girls & young adult women who are still impressionable.  In television, you're supposed to create an interesting story but also teach young adult women in their tweens how to use their common sense!  NOT teach them to re-submit their bodies again to these unworthy guys so they can be subjected to another round of emotional abuse!

Caroline, by Mid-Season-3, finally gets her man Trey & had the wedding of her dreams, but he has serious sexual-issues with pornography that---eventually---need to get resolved with Couples-Counseling.  My opinion of her problem will be ongoing as I continue to watch the series---albeit with much less enthusiasm than I started out with in my weekend binge of the first three Seasons.

Overall, I really disagree with the way Darren Star the Creator & the HBO writers, designed this series.  I honestly feel I could have written it up a whole lot better where the script would have been interesting, but all the women would have maintained some level of decency as well, and certainly wouldnt have had as many one-night stands and casual-sex encounters as Darren Star & the writers put in the script.

So in conclusion, for me, from the beginning up to the middle of Season-3, Sex & the City was a disappointment where Mr. Big & most of the other guys shown were nothing more than selfish & clearly looking only for sex with NO commitments.  And all four women at some point ended up being made a fool out of repeatedly by these guys, except for Steve & Aidan, of course, who each wanted a sincere commitment in their relationship with no hidden agendas (or hidden issues like Trey), and ended up getting mistreated for it!",1456099200,2,8285,4.748603351955308

1693006,5,B000063TQS,"I love Season 3 of SATC.  Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha return for another sexy, funny, at times raunchy season of navigating love, sex, and relationships on the island of Manhattan.  As a long time fan of the show when it was in its premiere run on HBO, I think the Third Season marks the moment where the series really hit its stride.  It is a season where some relationships are challenged, some fall apart, and at the end of the day these 4 women will always be each other's soulmates.  There will NEVER be another show like SATC on television EVER!! You just can't capture lightning in a bottle twice.  Michael Patrick King and Darren Star did amazing things with this series based on the best-selling book by New York writer Candace Bushnell, who btw is eternally FABULOUS.  Buy all of her books, you will love them.

Every season of SATC is just as fantastic as the last.  There was never a low season as some shows have.  Every season hits just the right notes.  I liken SATC to a perfect glass of champagne, the perfect amount of bubbles, a sultry body, and a taste that leaves you longing for more.

Thank you Amazon for making every season available for streaming on Prime.",1455667200,4,1195,4.537383177570093

1694147,2,B000063TQS,"I am not going to comment on the series (although from me it gets three stars for various reasons) but I felt compelled to review the actual quality of the packaging and DVD setup because they are severely lacking.

These sets look attractive, but the packaging is very flimsy.  These are plastic cases that do not actually close, rather they just ""fold"" over, which is odd and they fall apart after moderate use because you basically have to lightly pry them open and physically hold them open in order to remove the disc--well that only lasts so long before the plastic simply snaps apart unless you only take the discs out a few times ever.

There is no content information on the packaging.  Yes, we know which season we are watching because it is noted on the cover, but there are no episodes listed, no indication which episodes are on which disc beyond ""Episodes 1-6.""  So, unless you truly have these memorized then plan on having to refer to the internet to figure out where the episodes fall, or, be prepared to put the disc in, wait for it to load and then for the menu to come up in order to find out what's on that disc.  This is no big deal if you're just watching the series in order once but if you are already familiar with the series and like certain episodes more than others or prefer certain time frames of the show then it's nice to be able to look at the DVD case to see which episodes are included on that particular disc.

The worst offense of these sets--in my opinion--is that there is NO ""play all"" feature.  I personally find this to be ridiculous, especially when we are dealing with a series that has such very short episodes.  And not only that but you have to hit ""play"" at least twice before the episode plays because they offer to play with commentary or without commentary and you have to actually select ""episodes"" from the main menu to get to that screen.  So, you have to go through all of that to play one episode and in the meantime the menus themselves are annoying as all hell, filled with non-stop background theme music and random bits of dialogue from the show which will play for all eternity if you let it.

I never thought I would be complaining about things that sound so silly, but after purchasing three seasons of the show and dealing with the general nuisance of the overly elaborate menus and functions of the DVDs I had to say it!

I would probably skip these and go for the newer sets if they are available.  Maybe some of these super annoying issues have been resolved?",1394323200,,2527,4.431965442764579
1694148,5,B000063TQS,like the show mostly mid series seasons less glam more sex grit season three is one of my favorites yay,1393459200,,103,4.2
1694149,5,B000063TQS,These are definitely characters you can relate to in some way or another. They are all so different but are still best friends/family who would do anything for each other regardless of what might be going on in their own lives at the time.

I was surprised how grainy the picture quality is, even with upconverting Blu Ray player.  The new white packaging has a set of menus.  It no longer shows clips of the shows, which is a little bit disappointing, though nice if you're one of those people who tend to forget to turn the DVD off after you're done watching it and end up hearing the same 5 phrases over and over for an hour as you do other things.  Now the menu is just a fly-through of the NY skyline and the titles of the episodes.  I think the packaging is prettier than the original, but to most people that's not a big deal.  I'd give the series 5 stars, though these DVDs probably only deserve 2 stars because of the picture.",1293926400,2,846,4.153374233128834

1694269,5,B000063TQS,"What made ""Sex and the City"" such a memorable and wonderful show (aside from the great shoes Carrie owns) was the chemistry between the leads and the impeccable writing. The stories were always told with intelligence and wit, with drama being an important element, but with laughter thrown in; anyone who has ever lived life knows you can't get by every day without problems and humor and this series' creators knew this from the get go. This why ""Sex and the City"" struck a cord with the American public.
 This set contains all 18 episodes from season 3 that aired originally on HBO during the summer of 2000. During this season Carrie continues to struggle in her somewhat strange relationship with Mr. Big while meeting a hunky stud named Aidan. Unfortunately, Carrie has an affair with Big which could blow up in her face. Miranda is still with Steve, but then discovers she has a sexually transmitted disease from a former partner. Samantha, being Samantha, dates a man who won't go any further with her until she is tested for HIV; the scene with Samantha in the doctor's office is hilarious. Finally. Charlotte meets Trey, a handsome New Yorker who's still living under his rich, snobbish mother's thumb, socialite Bunny.
 Overall, a great season filled with innovative stories with the underlying theme that your life is only fulfilled if you have great fashion, great sex, and great friends. One of ""Sex and the City's"" best years.",1275264000,,1440,4.849593495934959

While we do follow the progress of Charlotte's new marriage, this season is slightly more tilted toward the girls themselves- their feelings, their discoveries about themselves, the importance of their mutual friendship- than about who they're seeing romantically.  I enjoyed that added attention to the inner life of the core cast.  I also enjoyed- mild, broad spoiler here- how the season closed on a subtle grace note, with each of the girls facing a new, uncertain road before them, a road fraught with a little scariness (as they all seem to think to themselves, ""what's in store for me?"") but also laced with a little hope.",1217894400,2,879,5.1328671328671325

I love this season because the comedy is so fresh and fun.  The storylines are great, and the fashion is in its most forward stage.
In this season, you will find such great quotes as: ""I sound like a perverted Nancy Drew."" Aidan is introduced and Big makes a steamy comeback, while Charlotte meets the man of her dreams Trey.

And the clothes in the 2 L.A. episodes are so outrageous: i.e. Carrie's neon green bathing suit and her hot pink sequin fanny pack.

1694320,5,B000063TQS,"*Possible spoilers within.*

Though it had grown progressively better through its first two seasons, the third season of ""Sex and the City"" was by far the best yet.  That's because the show stopped depending so much on placing the characters in outrageous situations and began also paying attention to the characters themselves, creating numerous story arcs as well.  By the end of the third season, each of the characters had developed, but realistically so.

Season Three, comprised of 18 episodes airing from June to October 2000, thrust the girls into the new millennium.  Still recooperating from her second breakup with Mr. Big (Chris Noth), Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) reluctantly returns to dating, first with a charming politician (John Slattery) before falling into her first serious relationship since Big with an irresistible all-American furniture designer named Aidan (John Corbett).  But then, just as things are going perfectly, none other than Mr. Big himself reappears in Carrie's life, leading to a chain of events that will hurt more than just our favorite sex columnist.

The supporting characters get their share of storylines as well.  Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) finally finds a serious relationship when she meets Steve (David Eigenberg), an adorable and sweet bartender.  Their relationship is always on the edge, however, thanks to Miranda's tendency to self-destruct when things start going well.  Samantha (Kim Cattrall) gains a little morality and self-control (but just a little) while she deals with the fact that she's getting older.  Then there's Charlotte (Kristin Davis), who decides that this is the year she's going to get married.  It turns out she's right.  So who's the lucky man?  None other than the peerless Kyle MacLachlan (of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Velvet/dp/B000063JDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Velvet</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twin-Peaks/dp/B000M3439E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twin Peaks</a>"" fame, among much else).  But Charlotte is shocked to find herself loosening up when she realizes marriage isn't all she'd thought it would be.

The work of the series' writers really made this season the show's finest yet.  The girls' antics had been enough to support the show through the past seasons, but they would only support them for so long.  The writers realized this, and they developed enough story arcs and difficulties to re-shape the characters and keep viewers on the edge of their seat.  Not to worry, though: Carrie kept on answering those questions that continue to haunt women around the world.  And while the season's multiple storylines keeps the season feeling fresh from start to finish, the writers went above and beyond when they moved Carrie and the gang to L.A. for a couple of episodes.  It was a refreshing change from the increasingly dreary streets of New York, and included wonderful guest appearances from Vince Vaughn, Hugh Hefner, Carrie Fisher, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Matthew McConaughey.

Season Three was the show's best season yet, thanks to excellent work on the writers' parts and a fabulous guest cast.  As the season finale came to its close, Carrie was reunited with Big yet again.  This time, however, their meeting ended with smiles and hope rather than tears and disappointment, leaving the millions of ""Sex and the City"" addicts feeling anxious and optimistic about what promised to be a superb fourth season.",1177632000,3,3515,5.56390977443609

Carrie also has an affair with Big, who is married to Natascha. After she finds out and Carrie ruins their marriage, she breaks things off with Big, much to the relief of her friends who know that Big isn't good for her at all. Feeling guilty, she tells her boyfriend Aidan and he breaks up with her. I guess the truth hurts. There's a fun three episodes when the girls head to L.A. where we get a bunch of cameos from the celebs. Carrie ends up sleeping with a house-sitter (Vince Vaughn) who says he's a casting agent, but really is just watching Carrie Fisher's house. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy!) appears as Debbie, an obnoxious talent agent, and Hugh Hefner appears as himself and kicks Samantha and the girls out of his party after a mishap with a faux purse.

1694405,5,B000063TQS,"In a time where good television shows are few and far between, one learns to appreciate the genius of the HBO networks' hit TV shows.  Prime time and ""Late Nite"" TV were formerly dominated by the ""main networks"": ABC, NBC, CBS, etc... That was until HBO got in on the action.  With shows like Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and the Sopranos, HBO is probably the leading purveyor of good TV today.  Sex and the City is probably one of its most enjoyable shows.  So that's saying something.  As a teenage straight guy, I was definitely a late comer to the series, as, well, let's just say the male heterosexual 18-25 year-old market is not one that Sex and the City is a major factor in.  But it damn well should be.  This show is written BRILLIANTLY, and takes turns at being both hillarious and touching.  It even makes me like Sarah Jessica Parker, and I haven't liked her since ""LA Story"".  Each of the girls has something different to offer us as viewers.  Carrie (Parker) keeps us moving from scenario to scenario, Samantha (Kim Cattral) is a single-and-loving-it type that provides much of the sexual humor, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon)is endearing if not a little pathetic, and Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is just simply adorable.  Not many shows make me yell at the screen or cheer while I'm watching, but after just two episodes, even I was starting to feel anxiety watching Carrie and Big tip-toe around their issues.  Anyone who appreciates great writing and originality will love this show.  Also, I have to tip my hat to the people writing the show, and especially the corporate execs at HBO for having the ... to go out while they're still relatively on top.  That doesn't happen very often in today's profit-hungry entertainment industry!

1694410,5,B000063TQS,"Okay, let's start off with just saying that I started watching Sex and the City during it's fourth season. After I saw a few episodes, I went to Best Buy and bought The Complete First & Second Seasons of Sex and the City.
My eyes were glued to the tv. Side-splitting humor combined with four sexy women and I say you have a winner. One episode after another after another. It never gets old. This show really explores sexuality and what women think about it. I find this show very informative yet funny. Sometimes, I even forget I'm watching a show. I feel like I'm in NYC, with the ladies, talking about sex.
When The Complete Third Season came out on DVD, I bought it the first day it was for sale. Still great sexual humor. I couldn't get enough of it. But in the third season, the show started showing a more dramatic side of the characters. Not that I'm saying its bad, I just like it when you can have humor with information, with drama. And not too much drama, just enough.
As I was watching The Complete Fourth Season, I began to realize, I'm starting to connect with these characters. Thats amazing!
I highly anticipate the fifth and sixth seasons on DVD. The fifth season was short but sassy and comedic. Although I have only seen the first 5 episodes of the sixth and final season, I'm sure it'll be just as good or even better then the last 5 seasons. Though it will be sad to see the ladies go, I'm hoping they'll make a Sex and the City movie, or something to keep us SATC fans going.
So if you're out there...contemplating whether or not you should buy any of the show's DVDs, don't think twice about it, order them NOW. I recommend you order all so you can get the full ""dose"" of the show.

1694423,4,B000063TQS,"You don't have to worship restaurants, martinis, or expensive shoes to enjoy the addictive indulgence called ""Sex and the City"". It is a pleasant, if amoral diversion. There are no real lessons to be learned, just a few smiles and glimpses of the high life in New York City. In this third season, our heroine, sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw, finds and loses and new boy friend, rediscovers and loses an old boyfriend, and another friend finds, loses, rediscovers and once more loses a husband. Along the way, ""Sex"" offers us dream-like visions of New York as the singles capital of the world. In one episode, Bradshaw teaches a class on the subject. She does a poor job; perhaps she hasn't really learned her own lessons.
Setting aside the fact that time, money and work seem to be irrelevant to these four women, this Seinfeld-like quartet offers four versions of the consummate thirty-something (and perhaps then some) single Manhattan female. The weather is unerringly beautiful. Money flows out faster than the alcohol pours in. Men slip through their fingers faster than the feisty foursome can find them. Carrie is oh-so-petite, easy on the eye (despite the unruly mess of roots and tones that constitute her hair color) and hard on the heart and the wallet.  She is indecisive and inconsistent. Her brief `philosophical' reflections that center her column and the title of each episode disguise a life otherwise void of reflection. Samantha, the public relations executive, is sexually obsessed and without qualms and, apparently, traditional morals. Meeting an equally active thirteen-year-old girl only sets her back for a brief moment. Sam feels merely old, not chastened. `Safe sex' and any STD seem to have eluded her as she cuts a very wide sexual swath through the city. Miranda, now a partner in her law firm, has her own outlandish red hair and a cloying bartender boy friend who allows her to manifest her own multiple insecurities, be they in her career or in her brief encounter with orthodontic braces. She is the `serious' one of the group, the professional woman climbing the corporate ladder at great social expense. And Charlotte, the classically beautiful and `innocent' member of the foursome, is intent on following some self-imposed social-climbing order. She succeeds and quickly fails in each step. She may not have the stamina to keep up with the other three, only the nerve to try.
This series is certainly not for the prudish. The language is blunt, direct, and colorful, with some funny, crude lines. This is bathroom - or locker room -- talk around the coffee shop table. The Legion of Decency would ban it outright. There is no real morally redeeming value. The language is unencumbered but more colorful than crude. The sexual nudity is common (mostly Samantha) but usually `tasteful', that is, not graphically pornographic. These four women are less role models than they are caricatures that provide comic relief and fantasies for people who think that New York singles' life is easy and glamorous. For those who think the single, rich life in Manhattan is an idyllic existence; this show is the storyboard for that life. Enjoy the scenery, look a little harder beneath the surface, tune out the language and nudity, and you find a pretty harsh, unappealing existence, and perhaps some useful life lessons.",1057536000,5,3344,5.003590664272891
1694424,4,B000063TQS,"As a loyal fan of SITC, I love Season Three. It has all the excitement and hilarity I've come to expect from the show. Some of the most important developments of Season Three include: Carrie's relationship with Aidan, Mr. Big's marriage to Natasha, Miranda's break-up with Steve and Charlotte's marriage to Trey. All of these developments are enthralling and wonderful to see played out. The only reason I don't give five stars is that Season Three is melodramatic compared to past seasons. The chase scene at Mr. Big's apartment and Carrie's (temporary) loss of Aidan's dog are two examples. I found those scenes, and others like them, to be a bit too over-the-top.

Despite the fact that this show began 6 years ago, it's still as fresh, smart, and hilariously funny now as it was then. In fact, it's only gotten better. Without a doubt, Sarah Jessica's natural charm is the show's greatest asset. But, Kristin Davis (Charlotte), Cynthia Nixon (Miranda), and the incomparable Kim Catrall (Samantha) each bring something unique and special to every single episode. They're all very different from eachother, but the chemistry is unbelievable. It just works! As the seasons have progressed, each character is becoming emotionally deeper (even Samantha!). It's not just about sex. With each episode, we see more and more true colors shining through with all 4 girls. That's what keeps the show fresh and interesting.

You can't get bore of watching SAC. It has just the exact levels of eroticism and sex not to fall into a vulgar show. Besides, the scripts are so smart and not to mention the perfomances: Sara Jessica Parker as the smart columnist, Kristin Davis as the conservative lady, Cynthia Nicholson as the judgemental and last but no least (totally the opposite) the marvelous acting of Kim Kattrall as the bitchy, self-confidence, man-eater Samantha Jones (She's hot and she rules! ;)).

This show is the perfect blend of comedy and therapy.  I have much to reflect on after an episode about my own relationships and the foolishness involved.
The questions asked as Carrie writes her articles (the basis for her narration in the series)provide quite stimulating conversation long after the episode has ended.
If you are reading this article, i am sure you have already seen seasons 1 and 2, and really don't need me to urge you to buy this season.  However, this season is a favorite of mine because it Introduces Aiden, which could be the perfect guy for Carrie, but--well, you will see for yourself.

The writing is sharp and intelligent as well as thought provoking, while the story lines are titillating and downright sexy. They have created the perfect package and by the multiple awards that the show and its artists have won, it is apparent that the powers that be are watching, and they like what they see.
After watching all three seasons, I have to say that each season is getting better. The storylines are more interesting with guest appearances that include a trip to the playboy mansion to meet Hugh Hefner, and a chat with Sarah Michelle Gellar on a trip to LA. The writing is cutting edge, and the relationship dilemmas come across as real. The sex is fun for the armchair voyeur who dreams that his or her life could be so exciting. People can relate to the whole parcel.  It is an enjoyable time to be had by all.  Kelsana 8/13/02",1029196800,3,938,4.511764705882353

1694448,5,B000063TQS,"Never missing an episode of this HBO masterpiece original program, is on the top of my list.  So was getting the Third season to add to my First and Second collections.

Being a native of New York City, and having worked, dated, and socialized in the one of a kind, glorious, non-stop party that IS life for those lucky enough to live it here, I can honestly say that ""Sex.."" captures the mood, spririt, and attitude of all the attractive, successful and confident New York women, and those like them elsewhere.  While you watch, you really feel like you know Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda.  You are at once, sympathetic to their plight, and happy when they're happy.  The characters remain as distinct in season three, as they have been through the past two seasons.  However. in season three, I think they even go deeper into what really makes each character so fascinating.

There are some very ""BIG"" plots this time around, as Carrie's on again/off again. Mr. Big, (Chris Noth) goes way off and marries the much younger Natasha.  I was as angry about this as Carrie!  Of course, after he's committed, he wants Carrie more than ever.  She simultaneously tries to juggle two men after meeting a very significant other, a sculptor named Aidan.  Despite his complete difference from Big, and his solemn aversion to smoking, Carrie gets herself involved.  This becomes the perfect fodder for Big's jealousy after a chance meeting with Carrie and Aidan at a furniture show he's attending with his WIFE.

Meanwhile, Charlotte meets Trey (Kyle McLachlan) a doctor who seems to be Mr. Right.  A whirlwind romance leads to a proposal when Charlotte pops the suggestion and Trey says ""Allrightie"" much to her chagrin.  Her steadfast resolve in saving ""it"" for the wedding, may lead to her overlooking a very important piece of the marriage puzzle.

As Miranda takes up living with the irritating, but simple and sweet Steve, and Samantha is, well, still Samantha, the four friends have more fun than ever.  The season culminates in a foray to the west coast, where well known faces like Vince Vaughn, Hugh Hefner and Sarah Michelle Gellar pop in, are glitzy glamorous fun.  Although, why a successful woman like Samantha would buy a fake Fendi handbag is beyond me!

For anyone who follows this great show, this third season set is a must-buy, must-keep and a must-see, over and over again.",1027728000,9,2393,4.835380835380835

All the characters come from the same drag queen with multiple personality disorder (Samantha in particular, though delicious, is all fantasy), and Carrie as a character is SO jewish, in terms of her bookishness and always processing everyone ELSE's opinions, it is odd that they claim she came from ""somewhere upstate"", never mentions a mother and finally, had a father that abandoned her at a young age and is no particular religion.  Very thrown-together.  Doesn't make sense, never has.
But my real beef is the packaging.  At first I thought the plastic cover style (which has remained consistent through the seasons)was cool.  Until I cut my hand open on it.  Then on eBay I noticed many people selling the DVDs used mention the cover had come off (so either they got cut, too or the packaging wasn't designed for longevity).

This show is not about sex so much as it's about a group of four friends and their journeys through love, loss, and questioning what's really important.  The main character, Carrie (played so well by Sarah Jessica Parker), writes a newspaper column where she muses on the meanings of relationships and love.  The story revolves around her friendships with the other three characters: Samantha -- a very loose woman who deep down longs for a lasting relationship but goes through lots of sexual escapades; Charlotte -- an uptight, but sweet upper-crust rich girl who loves and loses terribly; and Miranda -- a type A lawyer who can't seem to reconcile sharing her life and her personal space even if she's in love.  The characters are very well developed and the actors portray them so well that you completely believe they are who they play.

The greatest pleasure of all is that this show is available on DVD.  So if missed the show up until now like I did -- you must buy the DVDs.  Be sure to start with season #1 and work your way to this set.  I now own the first 3 season sets and anxiously await season 4.

From the moment that theme song plays, you know this is going to be good.  And those very unwholesome but endearing conversations between Samantha (my brother, 11, loves the episode where Samantha seduces the college student of the same name. . .don't worry, I flicked away during the parts that should not be viewed by little eyes.), Charlotte (who doesn't love Charlotte, anyway?), Miranda (the braces were the best), and of course, Carrie (who mirrors me in personality and thought, not to mention those slinkster cool outfits she gets to wear.) Though Sex & the City is a little explicit in places it does show the best side of women's friendships and DON'T WE ALL WANT CARRIE AND BIG JUST TO GET TOGETHER?

1694510,5,B000063TQS,"Sex and the City is one of very few TV shows that actually gets better as the seasons go by.  Season three shows an incredible amount of growth in the characters (we get to see more of their intellectual and emotional sides, not just the sex lives), a more optimistic view of what the future is going to bring for them, and the usual amount of tasty (and sometimes tasteles)  humour that has made many of us die-hard fans from the beginning.
In this season we get to see things that we hadn't expected (although many of us had been hoping for them) such as Carrie's new love interest (this time she meets someone who is actually ""available"" and loves her sincerely), the subsequent sadness that follows the best moments in such relationship (I won't elaborate much: don't wanna ruin it for those who haven't seen these episodes), Charlotte's engagement and marriage (and the ""stiff"" moments that she'll be enduring), Samantha's emotional growth, and Miranda's life with Steve (and after).
Some very charming, funny, and sad moments are found in these eighteen episodes.  This set, like the previous two, is perfect for a weekend of leisure with a couple of friends, some wine or beer, and a big bowl of popcorn:  fun at at its simplest and greatest.  Likewise, the packaging is just as nice as the previous two, elegant and sexy.  The extras aren't many to be honest, only the usual ""annotated"" episodes with commentaries from the director.  Still, it is in the episodes themselves that the value of this package is found.  If I could give this series more than five stars, I would.  That's how much I love it.  You will too, do not doubt it.

1694547,2,B000063TQS,"I found the few episodes I managed to sit through unimaginative, the characters truly unlikeable.  And maybe that's the point--these are men and women you laugh at, not with.  That the humor of this show is derisive and cynical, showing how superficial many lives really are--and how empty and materialistic our culture has become.  If that's the point, I get it.  If that isn't the point (as many of the positive reviewers suggest), then be afraid.  Be very afraid.  If this is ""real life"" for many people, then things are far worse than I ever imagined.
The main characters do a good job of mimicking the most shallow, self-absorbed, vain, and misdirected women I know.  They are obsessed with sex talk and sex, have perilously low self-esteem, have little or no intellectual depth, and, in the end, are leading absolutely meaningless lives.  Do they discuss significant ideas?  No.  Do they care more about clothing and money than emotional depth?  Yes.  They make the empty-headed ""Friends"" seem complex in comparison.  At least they can manage childish relationships with equally empty-headed men blended together with low-brow stupidity.
I know this isn't meant to be Shakespeare, but there is only so much of it that you can watch.  There is enough of this ""humor"" in real life.  (It is quite sad, really, to see the number of female reviewers who claim that this show comes close to describing their ""urban"" lives.)
They should have a reunion show when these women are in their early sixties.  Health problems beginning to mount.  Age taking its toll.  A few lost jobs.  No real relationships in sight.  Angst, alienation, and anomie setting in? (Forget it.  These folks wouldn't get it if it hit them over the head with a two-by-four.)  Endless plastic surgery.  Money running out.  Now, might that be worth a chuckle?  No, not really.
In a culture where the highest rated television shows are Friends and Survivor, the popularity of this show is hardly surprising.  Sad, but not a shock.",1022025600,20,1997,4.886567164179104

I have been waiting a long time to add the third season and I have the fourth season on video until it's available on DVD.  I have made my male friends total SATC junkies.

Me and my friend used to wait till the evening to watch it daily, episode by episode, and couldn't wait till we get the next season. Sex and the City tells about the real life as it is. How real relationships are, how real people talk, work, love and have sex... without boundaries and without losing the respect of the audience. It's not about relationships only, it's about the GREAT New York, and everything in it from its lifestyle to the Central Park.

the sexual goings on of these four manhatten lovlies is compulsive viewing.  never have i been captivated by a show that is so up front and so accurate at analysing relationships, sex and love.  its like having 4 of your best friends giving you therapy.
if you missed the first two seasons, then buy them and catch up -if you saw it, then you are probably as hungry for this dvd to his the store as i am!

7959659,5,B000063TQS,"This was (is) one of my all time favorite shows! Someone mentioned that this show was dated but you have to remember, this first aired in the late 90s, so the first few seasons of it ARE dated! It took them a few years into the series for the women to settle in to what their image was going to be, and what would remain for the rest of the series until it ended. Another thing people commented on was they talked too much into the camera, which they did a lot in the beginning but that subsided as the seasons progressed. Although, Im not sure why people have such a problem with that.....Modern Family does it and they are quite successful. Its not for everyone I guess.

For the show itself, yes, they talked about sex, they mused about sex......they waxed poetically about sex. But if you watch the whole series, youd discover that it was just all surface talk/activity. The show was much more about their friendships with each other. A close knit group of women who were more like family, not just girlfriends. And just like every other show out there, there was a character for everyone to either love or hate. Someone you could identify with yourself, or someone who youd never understand.

I originally watched the show when it aired on HBO, but then later bought them on DVD so I could binge watch whenever I want. I think I mustve watched the entire series at least 30 times! I never bothered watching them on a syndicated channel because they cut out all the good stuff. As much as people complain at how crude it could be sometimes (and it could), you lose some of that context when its cut out. With that said though, Im guessing if you didn't want to watch a show that leaned heavily on the topic of sex, you wouldnt be watching a show called Sex and the City. Just a guess!

Looking forward to seeing if another movie is in their future.....",1516752000,2,1856,4.405247813411079

This series is so attractive that I went to NYU(the author graduated from NYU) and NYC from China to chase it. But it is not fact, at least not all of the facts. It is more like a dream lifestyle or state. I tried so hard to love New York, live with New York, survive in New York, and still I really really loved the city although it has broken my hearts. Now I moved to Seattle for half a year but deep inside there is a voice to tell me:""go back New York"". Thanks for taking me here and opened a new world to me!

7959663,3,B000063TQS,"I've watched the series finally, I am just rewatching. I will say that I'm glad that I watched this in my twenties and not while I was a young teen, because the expectations in this show is very unrealistic, and a cosmopolitan fantasy world of privileged middle aged white women living the fast life, and talking about sex all the time. I think what's enticing about the show, is that it is cozy. It's not particularly funny, or well written, but for some reason I find it to be charming, and maybe there's even joy in critiquing it, hey. I will say, I absolutely adore Steve. He is literally my favorite person in the entire show. I genuinely love him and Miranda's relationship. It's realistic, and both of there acting was very well done. Steve is just such a beautiful, humble, nurturing, and loving guy. I love how they made his character. Carrie's character was problematic in so many ways, but I'll let the other reviews and online blogs pick that apart for you's. Overall, it wasn't written the best, and there were so many cringey, inappropriate, or bad acting moments, but it for some reason still has me watching.",1508630400,,1124,4.625

7959665,1,B000063TQS,"Carrie Bradshaw is the worst character I ever saw. Firstly, she quit smoking to be with Aidn, because smoking is a deal breaker for him. And she re-smokes when they are together since they are together, Aidn cannot dump her just because of that.

Secondly, she sleeps with a married guy when she is still with Aidn, and everything she said on the show is the ""I'm only human"" kinda talk. She makes all the excuses, and after all, it was not even romance, it is merely sex. It is the lowest of the low one can do.

Thirdly, she wants Natasha to forgive her for being the ""third lady."" After Natasha refused to call her back for so many time, she chases to Natasha's lunch. It is so selfish of her to expect Natasha's forgiveness. When Natasha got divorced and had her tooth broken, a simple apologize won't fix anything. Carrie does it just to make herself to feel better; she does not for a second consider how Natasha's feelings.

Fourthly, when Miranda said:""Big is not good for you, you are paranoid, insecure when you are with him."" It was supposed to be a kind advice from a friend, but Carrie would not listen, rather, she attacks Miranda of dumping her ex-boyfriend. But the fact is, when Miranda's ex-boyfriend wanted a baby, and she was not ready for it, she had to break up with him. Because they want different things in lives. What is wrong with it? Miranda even allowed him to sleep on the couch until he got his own apt. It is just funny a cheater accuse of her friend's breaking up with someone when it is normal, and it will only waste each other's time if they don't. How dare she!

Fifthly, when Samantha argued with the transgender girls and asked them to be quiet. Carrie said:"" Samantha always have a way with men, even they are half women."" She thinks transgenders are ""half men, half women"" several times at the last episode I got really offended when I heard it. It is so politically incorrect to say that, and it is not funny.

Overall, Carrie is a mess, and she is so judgemental regarding her friends. Just shut up already, please.",1500336000,7,2058,4.448275862068965
