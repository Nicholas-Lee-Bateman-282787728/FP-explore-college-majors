8477301,5,B005L24KV2,"Fabulous series. First, I will say I pwn many nature dvds and love almost everything by Attenborough; he is a hard act to follow. Yet, this series has a unique charm of its own. I found the strange angles and occasional out of focus shots thrilling. It felt more alive to me than other visual styles. The balance of typical shots combined with other angles combined to present a professional, quality series that captured and fascinated for many hours. I would have to say 99.8% of the shots are crisp, and I would regret if anyone ignores this excellent series due to slight blur without giving it a try.
Like other viewers, I would like more higher level educational information to be included in each show, but this is a top quality project nonetheless. Also, I do agree some of the male genital structure images were a bit much, and I hope the producers will tone it down in future projects. Overall, I am very satisfied.",1444521600,,925,4.578313253012048

8477303,3,B005L24KV2,"I've read many mixed reviews regarding this series. Having previously enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Water-Life-3pc-Blu-ray/dp/B002EZLO0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Water Life (3pc) [Blu-ray</a>], I was curious about this series; therefore, decided to give it a shot. My own experience was as mixed and varied as the reviews, as the whole production is very disjointed.

The first three episodes are quite colorful with many different species of animals on display. Where the first three episodes succeed is in the amount of wildlife shown. Where the first three episodes fail is in every other department. The camerawork and editing is all over the place and extremely unprofessional. Shots will zoom in and out, become unfocused, and the camera will quickly move away before the shot ends. It's very disorienting. It's also hard for the viewer to become wrapped up in the experience as animals are constantly staring directly at the camera, backing away from it, or pawing at it. On top of all that, there are some extremely questionable moments that left me wondering exactly what audience the series was meant for. The narration is geared more towards children and most of the photogography caters to those who just want to relax and enjoy some colorful creatures. However, don't get too comfortable because in the midst of admiring a brilliantly colored bird the footage will suddenly cut to a crocodile yanking a mass of intestines from an animal carcass, or a close-up lingering shot of a half-eaten possum with entrails trailing behind it, or an animal dropping a load. Also, I know animals displaying their naughty bits can be expected in a nature documentary, but many times those bits seem to be the focus of the shot, as if the cameraman was an immature kid obsessed with filling the shot with privates. Because of these elements parents may want to think twice before showing their children this series.

As for the final three episodes, the technical quality drastically improves. Shots stay in focus, animals stop interacting with the camera, and the editing is less sporadic. It's as if an entirely different, professional, team took control of the project. Unfortunately, due to the change in region, the color scheme becomes rather drab. Moreover, the focus remains almost entirely on avians.

I recommend one give&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Water-Life-3pc-Blu-ray/dp/B002EZLO0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Water Life (3pc) [Blu-ray</a>] a look first. If that proves to be an enjoyable experience, and a drop in quality is anticipated, then this series may be worth a watch. Overall, I thought it was OK. I'll be watching it again eventually. It just wasn't nearly as enjoyable as I'd hoped. With lowered expectations another viewing should be more satisfying.",1359072000,4,2877,5.578947368421052
8477304,5,B005L24KV2,"Picture quality is nearly perfect, scenery is excellent overall (although SOME footage is zoomed in a bit too close), and narration is pretty informative. It's not quite as professional as BBC's shows like ""Planet Earth"", ""Blue Planet"", ""Wild Pacific"", ""Life"", etc, but that is an extremely high standard, and approaching that status is impressive for a smaller organization.
You won't be disappointed.",1350864000,4,402,5.5
8477305,4,B005L24KV2,"Although I can't in good conscience give it the 5 stars that I'd normally award to films by BBC's Natural History Unit, it is through no fault of their cinematographers.  The editing might have been better, but I can't even really complain.  Having previously purchased this team's ""Water Life"" trio of disks, I had a fairly good idea of what to expect, since their camera-work there was also comparable to BBC's, and you'd be hard-pressed to find anything better.  There are added graphics to ""Wild Life"" I could do without, but all in all, I feel it is a fine addition to my collection of nature Blu-rays, and I'm fairly pleased with it.  The parallels they explore with ecosystems of Central America and the Iberian Penninsula as bridges joining distinctly differing evolutionary environments is intriguing, interresting, and exceptionally beautiful.",1341360000,,853,5.115107913669065
8477306,5,B005L24KV2,"My usual complaint about nature programs is that they show the same animals again and again (aka apes, polar bears, sea turtles, elephants) and leave out the other
99% of wildlife that is just as amazing and in many cases more interesting (what DON'T we know about Apes for instance). And the new age/choir music you can leave that out of my nature shows please.
Like the ""Water Life"" series this one I will watch many times over, has a home movie feel to it sometimes but that is okay by me, just bring on the other 99 per cent of these interesting animals and leave the other overexposed animals alone!",1336694400,,604,4.45045045045045
8477307,4,B005L24KV2,"I noticed the other review for this product, which was very well written by someone who definitely knows his stuff. However, I wanted to add a different viewpoint, because I liked this series a lot.

This is not Planet Earth. I enjoy the Planet Earth series very much. The difference to me is that Planet Earth provides a 5-minute story on an animal or family of animals. In Wild Life, so many different species are considered and some less-obvious connections between different species are highlighted - Very interesting.

The popular animals are given their due, but where I think Wild Life gets it right is that they worked very hard to bring in an amazing variety in every area of the world.

It's look and feel is professional and polished. I really do enjoy it. If you have watched any of the episodes, you know what I mean. ""Filmed in HD, this captivating series explores why each is so rich in biodiversity--and how all life is connected in astonishing ways.""

It provides variety to the appreciation of nature. On my HD screen, I feel like the different areas of the world come to life with beautiful detail and color. The camera work was very smooth, and I couldn't believe how many different species were examined and portrayed.",1330560000,9,1239,4.695852534562212
8477308,1,B005L24KV2,"I was really looking forward to this program.  The good news is that it showed quite a few animals that I had never seen before and that is good.  Not all of that footage was good and some was only a few seconds.  They rarely mentioned what the animals were.  I was glad to see the footage but now I want to know what those animals and birds were.

I have to say that a lot of it was like watching home movies.  The thing I really hated about the program was that they would show a scene and build an imaginary bridge over the area and show a ball of bubbles shooting across it and leaving a trail of bubbles.  They did this to show how animals were using these land bridges to migrate.  They also showed the bubble in footage that had nothing to do with the animals just as filler to drag out the movie.  They would have been better off to leave those entire segments out and shorten the entire set to an hour of good footage.

They also used footage of only parts of animals such as the lower half of the torso and some of the legs.  They also had footage of a quarter of the head (what good is that).  They should not use footage that they had to zoom in on to see the animals either.  The pictures were grainy on occasion.  The quality of the footage was lacking as well.  To call it breathtaking was a stretch.  The colors appeared to be not as vibrant as they should have been.  They also used footage of African animals to represent the animals that were living in the area of the Sahara but were no longer able to live there.

For the people who did this program, you failed.  This was like a home movie.  Don't show footage of going down a waterway and into a bush.  Please leave segments that have no substance out of the program.  Don't zoom in on the head of an animal and use the footage.  Show the whole animal so we know what it looks like. Do more editing and leave out all that filler.  The naration was extremely annoying.  They tried to describe animials with attributes they don't posess.  A heron fishing is not evil and neither is any other preditor.  Why play music depicting them as evil.  Animals do not have a treaty with us to allow them to survive as you suggest.  You made me want to turn off the sound.

I have collected nature programs for many years and this is the only one I would use if I am unable to sleep.  It was almost a complete waste of time.  Perhaps I am used to programs like ""Life"" and ""Planet Earth"" which were vibrant an alive.  This program doesn't even compare.",1326240000,11,2511,4.175365344467641
