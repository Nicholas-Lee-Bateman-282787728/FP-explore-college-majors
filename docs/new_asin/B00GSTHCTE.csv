You get all the big plays with this DVD but I want to see how the game was really won, not just the big plays, and not just re-watching the game either, although that would be fun too..

6108469,3,B00GSTHCTE,"This is at points a surprisingly lame edit of the big game.  There are some major omissions (e.g. a good wide view or even a replay of Percy Harvin's rapid sweep around the edge in the first series).  The extensive sideline chatter from players and coaches is terrific, but overall the NFL's online two-part highlight reel of this Superbowl is much better than this sometimes oddly clumsy edit.

The DVD also features highlights from every game of the 2013/14 season (including the Divisional playoff and the Championship game), which are great to watch.

.
The best part of the DVD is the EXTRA CONTENT. Of the six, three are very memorable: ""The Richard Sherman Story,"" ""The Journey of Pet Carroll,"" and ""The Derrick Coleman Story."" The first tells of the young Richard Sherman's attempts to get out of poverty while living in gang ridden Watts. The second relates the head coach's early failures and his pursuit for redemption. The third tells about NFL's first audio deficient player and his struggles with his handicap. All three are human interest stories on overcoming almost impossible odds and achieving success in the end.",1403308800,2,854,5.02112676056338

I fast-forwarded for what seemed like an eternity to get to the actual game, only to find out this DVD is, for all intents and purposes, just a highlight reel. I really don't give a tinker's cuss about all the pre-Super Bowl games (of which again, you only get highlights), the locker-room pep talks, or the endless monotony of pre-Bowl analysis - just give us the game!! The majority of this DVD could be compressed into the length of the half-time show, so maybe instead of Bruno Mars, the producers could just do all their talking head nonsense in that spot of the game.

I'm extremely pleased overall as it recaps each week and each game in chronological order, as well as the playoffs.  Also, many extra features along with the main viewing offered.  Well produced and it does an excellent job overall of displaying the key moments of the season.  My only complaint is I wish it were longer and offered even more memories from throughout the season for review.  I also think a featurette or an additional commentary about the rivalry between the Seahawks and the 49ers would have been a nice addition as this is, in many opinions, the best rivalry in the NFL currently and these were probably the two best teams in the league during the 2013 season (NFC Championship was a much more exciting game than the blowout of the Super Bowl, though I'm not complaining).",1397606400,2,893,4.698717948717949

The picture and sound quality surpass the actual broadcast of the games, and even the extras are high quality (not always the case with extras).  Excellent narative starting with the way the 2012 season ended which, as any fan knows, is where the journey of 2013 really started.

Love the sideline and locker room insights and player/coaches being mic'ed.  Gives viewers a perspective that we can't get any other way.  I especially liked the spotlights on Russell, Sherman, and Coach Carroll, but seeing other players in this light was great, too.  The disc has the (rare) interview with Lynch at the media day, and even the controversial attempted handshake by Sherman to Crabtree in the NFC Championship game.  I don't recall seeing this in replays anywhere else, but there was a lot of chatter about it during the two weeks leading up to the SB.

This is a great disc for any football fan, and a MUST HAVE for any Seahawk fan out there!

I grew up with them in the AFC West and Denver had our number 85% of the time. Never thought I'd see them in a Super Bowl and against Manning thought for sure it would have turned out way different but our boys did it over the best offensive team in the league. But back to the disc I haven't opened it and I probably won't so I hope it has the whole Super Bowl game on it and not just how we got there. I am a very Die Hard Fan and will be until the day I die.

Please be advised that you are not getting the Super Bowl game DVD as I had thought and expected. Instead you are getting highlights from the entire 2013/2014 season, including playoff games and the Super Bowl.

If this is what you are looking for than go ahead with this purchase, if you are looking for the Super Bowl DVD look again.

Thankfully it wasn't water boiling, it was exactly what I expected. Great footage from the season and the official NFL voiceover guy (and Steve Raible!!) doing all the commentary. Plus some great extra features.

Reliving (part) of that glorious season is awesome, and even though this offering is disappointing, I watch it almost once a week; you can only win your first Superbowl once, I'm enjoying it.

...but that usually goes for all things Seahawks, right? I was a bit uninspired at first when my mom gave me this as a gift... leaving it unopened for days before finally breaking it open on a Monday night. Documentaries are notorious for being bland, even if one DOES feature your favorite team of your favorite sport. This one won't be a bore for a minute. I know it takes a special sort of fan to appreciate things like behind-the-scenes soundbits, especially when they're just clips of coach's pep talks, before, middle, or after a game... and I know that the idea of a highlight DVD is not the same as one that actually provides legal reruns of full games (In the works!), but this footage is actually varied in a very discreet way. You don't hear the commentators you heard on TV... you get to hear the ones that were on local radio, Steve Raible (Former NFL and Hawk if I'm not mistaken) et al. You get to hear soundbits from along the sidelines not featured in 'Mic'd Up' and other things you simply didn't see in other behind-the-scenes footage that WAS featured by mainstream media. Like I said somehow it's not just interesting to a hardcore Hawk fan, but interesting in general. You know how there are posters of super plays, like a monster slam dunk and the cliche' always is, ""I would hate to be the guy he is dunking on..."" Well, this disc somehow achieves a neutrality that avoids highlighting failures on the other side, while STILL achieving the highlights that fans... general NFL fans, bandwagoners and lifelong 12th's alike... will appreciate.",1395792000,2,1615,4.666666666666667
6109058,3,B00GSTHCTE,"I have some mixed feelings about this, but overall it was fun to watch.

They covered just about every aspect of the Seahawks season, with every game covered from opening day to the last.

My problem is that they didn't cover anything in detail - they could have added 2-3 minutes of footage/talk through just a few of those important close games and it would have come out a much better viewing experience.  It felt to me like they gave a short summary of every game, including the Superbowl.  The special features are also lacking and don't add much to the experience.

That being said, I do love the footage that is used - they use the original Seahawks broadcaster sound bites, the actual NFL Films footage is beautiful as always and the sound quality is top notch.

Overall 3/5 from me - just a little bit more could have made a world of difference for me.",1395619200,,861,4.452229299363057

6109095,1,B00GSTHCTE,"This was my first experience with NFL Films, and it will be my last.  But first, let me own up to my part in the disappointment.  Like at least one other reviewer, I was mistakenly hoping for the complete Super Bowl game.  I could have been more careful, and the DVD could have been titled in a way that wouldnt be misleading.

But even taking the DVD for what it isa season reviewit fails miserably.  The shots are so up-close, its like watching the program though a peephole: All you see is one or two players or the ball!  Few shots are longer than two seconds, and with the silly ominous-sounding music, this is the equivalent of a football music video.  Some hack at NFL Films must have gone hog-wild in the editing room dicing and splicing the footage.  And there are too many ground-level shots.

At under 90 minutes, one could complain that the DVD is too short.  But given the headache-inducing quality of this material, 90 minutes is an hour too long.

If you don't find any of these characteristics objectionable, youll enjoy this DVD.  Otherwise, save your money.  Im hoping a higher-quality product is on its way, something similar to the MLB box sets of the World Series.",1395100800,6,1185,4.559241706161138

Each and every journey to the big game is filled with a variety of turning points,  Super Bowl 48 Champions is a slick, 115 minute trip through the 2013 season that gives viewers outstanding performances from Russell Wilson, Richard Sherman, Marshawn Lynch, and Pete Carroll.

As a sports fan, I enjoy the highlights in any league, and this presentation is well chosen and edited.  The team at NFL films does the best job in North America and are to be applauded.

I love that highlights from every game are shown, from the game one victory over Carolina to the Super Bowl victory over Denver. Also, even though they're short, I love the interviews with coach Pete Carroll and certain players.

I loved this so much, though. It's a ""movie"" of the Seahawks road to the Superbowl, with clips from their regular season and playoffs, and it also has clips of the parade (which I watched on TV for six hours: couldn't get nowhere near Downtown Seattle that day with all the traffic jams) in the end credits. My favorite moments:

1) Sherman being Sherman. I love him! LOUDER!
2) Coach Carroll getting fired up on the sidelines and getting emotional or jazzed up in the locker room.
3) Legion of Boom's crazy tackles. They'll run you over!
4) Harvin, Smith (our Superbowl MVP!!!), Baldwin, and Kearse making some great TDs.
5) Beastmode Lynch making runs with 5 guys attached to him and still scoring!!! Or eating Skittles off the ground in the end zone!
6) Avril hitting Manning's arm and forcing a turnover. One of my favorite moments in the Superbowl.
7) Bennett being Bennett. He's hilarious.
8) The huddles and dancing and the huddle dance.
9) Russell Wilson throwing crazy accurate passes and motivating the team. ""Why not us?""
10) Those crazy 12th Man fans. Who's that guy in the Incredible Hulk suit???
11) Steve Raible making the call. A former Seahawk and news legend here.
12) I also love Kam Chancellor! I'll never forget his interview after the 49ers playoff game him saying, ""I can't wait baby!"" [for Superbowl XLVIII]. That's exactly how I felt. He had the first interception of the game.",1394582400,30,1620,4.641114982578397

6109189,5,B00GSTHCTE,"I loved this video! The bonus features were very interesting, and sometimes funny as well. There is a short recap of each regular season game, then a closer look at the NFC Championship game and the Super Bowl. I applaud them for including the media day interviews, the profiles of several players and coaches, and the presentation of the Lombardi Trophy.

The only thing I didn't like is that they only spent a little time on the actual gameplay of the Super Bowl. Honestly, I would have loved it if they had included another disk of the game in its entirety. But, that's not worth me taking off a star for that, so I'll leave it at 5 stars.

It still hasn't really sunk in for me, personally, that the Seahawks made it to the Super Bowl, let alone won so convincingly. I just hope it doesn't take another 38 years of failure until they get another one... and I don't think that will be the case! GO HAWKS",1394496000,3,906,4.355029585798817

I only gave it four stars because my husband wished for more in-depth season coverage, and more from the Superbowl.  I would have liked more scenes from the parade day in Seattle - at least one overhead shot from a helicopter would have been cool, too bad one of the greatest days in Seattle history was only mentioned while the credits rolled.

6109233,4,B00GSTHCTE,"I pre-ordered this right after Seahawks won Super Bowl 48 as I wanted something to back to and watch to remember the joyous feeling of them winning it. The Blu-ray was pretty expensive ($35) at the time and I was actually about to cancel my order when it came close to shipping, but saw that the price was reduced to about $22.

I'm glad that I didn't cancel because this was Blu-Ray was really great. It documents the journey from the Seahawks loss to the Falcons the previous year all the way to their Super Bowl win against the Broncos. All games are covered with highlights from those games and some of the major talking points going into and out of the game. They were mostly pretty brief which I was a bit disappointed with (considering how I can just listen to Seahawks stuff all day), but I can see most people saying it was just right. Overall it's about an hour and a half long not including special features.

Special features are pretty cool. It includes lots of interviews with the star players (including one of the great interviews of all time with Deion Sanders and Marshawn Lycnh at media day) and other fun things like mic'd up players and coaches. I watched them all and most were pretty good. Probably my favorite was the short Richard Sherman documentary. He's really a fascinating person.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this to a Seahawks fan and say it's a must have for any die hard fan. However, make sure you get it for a decent price as there is definitely not enough content in it to justify $35. Also, the Blu-Ray looks and sounds great and comes with some extra special features, however I cannot comment on if it's worth it over the DVD as I don't have that to compare.",1394064000,5,1704,4.490322580645161

They interview Richard and his brother in front of the house that they were raised in, right in Compton. I knew this wasn't a DVD of the Super Bowl so that didn't disappoint me.

The recaps are cursory and have massive holes.  I recall watching a lot of the same footage for free on the NFL website videos section. After listening to the terrific coverage of Brock and Danny all year, I guess I had higher expectations from an NFL production.

There are some great segments and coverage but this quick to production product barely scratches the surface of what a 12 wants.  Someone at ESPN films can pick up an easy promotion by turning the time period from the SB 40 failure to Beast Quake to SB 48 into a 30 for 30. Or someone tell Paul Allen to dump some money into a feature. I know it will sell at least 70,000 copies.

Point of interest  The concept of the 12th man originally came from Texas A&M.  Texas A&M and the Seahawks settled out of court for Trademark infringement, allowing the Seahawks to continue to use the 12th man concept in 2006. Seahawks President Mike McCormack retired the number 12 jersey on December 15, 1984, in honor of the fans and their support of the team.

You wanna see some REAL football? Watch the Seahawks!
Watch out for next year you lily white wallflower dough boy fans from the small soft hands teams. The broken broncos showed you what's comin your way! An ole-fashion ass-whuppin'! The 3 best teams in the entire NFL are in the NFC West - SEAHAWKS, niners, and Arizona, as is the 6th best - St Louis (in my opinion). The next winner of the Super Bowl is again going to come from the NFC West (and I know the 'Hawks are going to blow the doors off all wannabes and pretenders this coming season (who can catch Percy Harvin? No one!) - so it's gonna be us again! The SEAHAWKS are the BEST of the best! I know this because as we all saw this past season, very few teams play real football (especially in the AFC) except for all four teams in the NFC West and Carolina. The rest might as well be cats at a dog show. Hissing and spitting but ultimately chewed up and spit out. I think they're afraid to play the game because real football and playing defense means contact, which = hits / damage = shorter career. They approach the game so as to not get hurt and as though it was pro basketball which is all about scoring. The SEAHAWKS showed them all how too wrong they are. Apparently they all forgot or ignored the fundamentals of the game - they forgot that 1/2 of the game of football is about PREVENTING the other team from scoring! And that is about big hits - hurting and intimidating your opponent (and maybe getting hurt yourself - but all worthwhile rewards entail risk), banging into people at full speed - tackling and dropping guys in their tracks, knocking your foe silly as often as possible! That kind of stuff. Sure its badass and rough - that's the REAL game, remember? And playing it that way keeps Jimmy Graham and any of the broken broncos hearing ""footsteps"" and thinking twice about catching anything in the middle of the field. When a team like the SEAHAWKS does that to their opponents, the game is mostly won. The rest of the win is just a matter of putting up just enough points by the offense. The Seahawks actually really believe that they can WIN games with their defense! When was the last time any team thought that? Are they right? Did they do that?
But enough gloating and blather! I hope that early December next year finds the Seahawks again 2 or 3 games up on the forty-whiners and in the #1 seed driver's seat. I would be very surprised if that was not true.",1392076800,16,2459,4.37117903930131
