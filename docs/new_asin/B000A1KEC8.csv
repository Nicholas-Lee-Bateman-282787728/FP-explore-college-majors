The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. Theres also Gerberts nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Gerbert truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldnt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Gerberts existential catchphrase Boop boop boop ba do, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. Im smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Andy Holmes genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Gerbert tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. Its for the ladies eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personal",1513814400,,1272,5.052380952380952

Our 15 year old rolled her eyes a bit about watching a 'kids' video, but all in all, it was a good way to open up some discussion one on one about the topic.",1312675200,2,246,3.823529411764706
