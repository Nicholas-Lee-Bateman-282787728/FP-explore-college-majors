8102415,5,B000DLA3LM,"This movie is a real trip. Features some of Hollywood's most far-out personalities, free thinkers and a fantastic soundtrack. Highlights are early footage of the Great Richard Alpert, with hair, before he became Baba Ram Dass and the legendary Bobby Jameson who was one of the Strip's most talented and outspoken musicians. Plenty of other characters to flip your wig over as well. Dig it if you dare or be square.",1519516800,,414,4.845070422535211
8102416,5,B000DLA3LM,"This film captures the ""Hollywood"" of the minds of real people who came to live in Hollywood because they felt it was only there that they could be their true selves.  Their scenes and words were not scripted beforehand.  If you're looking for another ""Hollywood"" make-believe fiction - seek it elsewhere.",1500595200,,305,4.96078431372549
8102417,2,B000DLA3LM,"This was a real mish mash of a film.  What made it interesting for me was the cinematic ""snapshots"" of 1960s popular culture (celebrities, happenings, etc.).  If those things interest you then this is worth a look.  Skip it if you are expecting a plot, a story, or anything coherent.",1453420800,,283,4.62
8102418,2,B000DLA3LM,"This movie just seems to wander around, looking at some of the various forms of human debris who lived in the Hollywood area in the Sixties. I tried watching it but there were no questions directed at any of these weirdos about their lifestyles, no background, no good transitions... really, it just wasn't that interesting. The only people who would be attracted to this film are those who like freak shows and even then I think they would be kind of bored.

Except for the skydiving. Skydiving is TOTALLY cool.",1421712000,,512,4.688888888888889
8102419,1,B000DLA3LM,"Overrated. I'd heard of this, and that it had been banned for a time so I was afraid to watch it, thought it might be too porno or something. It actually bored me. Scenes go from one to another quickly, early on there is some dirty hippy Boots, a millionaire's heir living in a garage, and the only thing I found remotely thought provoking was looking at people who would die so soon after this was filmed. No one can look at Sebring without thinking of his grisly murder by ber hippies, the Manson Family. It actually reminds me of today's Hollywood. Mansions inhabited by out-of-touch-with-reality stars and producers, then outside the Hills you have the waiters studying acting, tourists, and the nobodys who prop up the tourist trade. The trannys, the Jayne Mansfields, the strippers, come off as sad. Desperately sad. Worth a look if you need reminding on how revolting the 60s were in so many ways.",1421625600,,904,4.6918238993710695
8102420,5,B000DLA3LM,"This is one of those films that even though it is strongly flawed in terms of editing and structure, it is entirely engrossing, in its depiction of mid 1960s LA and the diversity of characters that it presents. I was on the look out for Bobby Beausoleil, whom the DVD flags as being a big feature, but actually he appears only really briefly towards the end, in the ""Whatever happened to"" bit, just a tiny glimpse of him- maybe my version was edited? Not sure. Anyway it's a bit of a hotch potch but what is fascinating about this film is the way the old Hollywood world is meeting the new world of 60s LA. Definitely worth viewing.",1410998400,3,632,4.364406779661017
8102421,3,B000DLA3LM,"one strange film...I found this when it was mentioned in David McGowan's book on Laurel Canyon. It shows some of the people and places he mentions... but dam this movie is all over the place and looks like it was made by the people on LSD it features.  I have no clue what to make of it or who it was made for.  Still some interesting stuff in it. . If you look up the history of some f the people in it, including  Carl Cohen, its even more interesting.",1408752000,3,454,4.022222222222222
8102422,2,B000DLA3LM,"This movie is unbelievable! I don't think they were thinking at all. The only reason I bought it is because Jayne Mansfield is in it for a brief second, seen attending a premiere. It is a crystal clear copy of this film, which previously i only had a horrible colector copy. It is typical of the Hippie type documentary films that were being made for Drive-in propaganda at the time in the late sixties. If you are thinking you can sit and enjoy an intellectual film about the sixties, forget this film. If your buying it because of some other reason, that is the only reason to do so.",1295913600,8,585,4.376146788990826
8102423,5,B000DLA3LM,"you would have to recognize Frank Zappa to find him in the final song performance scene, but he is briefl;y there. the rest of the sixties are filmed in what would be a kind of travel logue. i ordered this film because it is what used to be part of the drive in regular fare. the film itself is a little overlong. most of the segments have grown in importance since the snap shots were taken: a man who owns land, but not a home; an african americanj maid, and her reflections on the watts riots, gypsy boots! it arrived in good shape, aznd quickly. thanks, mike",1273190400,3,562,4.261682242990654
8102424,5,B000DLA3LM,"This film is a fun look back at Hollywood in the mid to late 60's.  Among its stars is brave Jay Sebring who was the first celebrity hair stylist and threw himself in front of a 8 1/2 months pregnant frightened Sharon Tate when Manson family hit man Charles ""Tex ""Watson took aim at her and lost his life 2 years after this film was made.  This film in many ways also shows how much Los Angeles has deteriorated over the last 40 + years.  I lived there 2000-2001 and it is much more crowded and dirtier now than in 1967.  The music is creative even for the time.  A wonderful film, which catches the essence of the time right at the end of the Beach Boys innocent time and the start of the Counter-Culture.",1260748800,9,706,4.2
