But then again if you buy this one, they can't cancel it on you, plus you can play it on Thanksgiving or any other day, so it's got that going for it, which is nice",1408060800,3,396,4.0

I also wouldn't let children watch it as the demonic faces that gradual become scenes of hellish torture with whispering latin can be quite disturbing.

I also found it annoy when it opened a portal to hell in my living room, I had guests coming later in the evening and fighting a demonic horde and losing my hand into the bargain made preparing the party food really difficult.

overall I'd give it a 3, though I felt some of the extra such as the director's commentary where he talks about his life, his mistakes and apparently commits suicide wandered off topic of how they created the production.",1395532800,9,706,4.457364341085271
