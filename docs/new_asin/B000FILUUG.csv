8123401,4,B000FILUUG,"I actually purchased this two pack for My Chauffeur with Deborah Foreman. Wasn't a blockbuster hit but it was definitely a cute little movie the first time I'd seen it, wanted to have it for my 80's collection. The quality of the DVD picture was a bit grainy, the sound levels were a little off, suggesting that perhaps this was not a first generation print, but it was still a good copy, nonetheless, and it sure beat paying the hundreds of dollars for an original print.",1236124800,,472,4.5
