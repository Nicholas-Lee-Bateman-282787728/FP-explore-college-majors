2615919,3,B000GPPPXQ,"The opera itself is fantastic, compelling in a similar way to Strauss' (also one act) 'Salome'. The set of this production I also greatly admired; obviously in starkness and colouring it was meant to recall certain late 20th century Wagner Ring productions. However, as another reviewer notes, the singing is often almost entirely drowned out by the orchestra because of technical incompetence in making the dvd. Also, the picture quality is very blurry.",1328745600,2,454,5.232876712328767
2615920,1,B000GPPPXQ,"I was just watching this and I had to turn it off.  These ladies, as great as they were in their day, were no longer able to deliver the qualities that this opera deserves.
Listen to the Solti version and spare yourself this agony.",1321315200,3,231,4.25
2615921,1,B000GPPPXQ,"It is absolutely shameful that reviewers here go on about the performance of Birgit Nilsson.  I love many of her recordings.  In her prime, she was magnificent.  This is a SAD performance.  Quite frankly, this is pitiful.  This was a cast that was marketed on the fame and abilities of years past.  Nilsson's voice is strained and off pitch (some reviewers will acknowledge this was sometimes an issue in her prime as well).  The high notes are not there.

I challenge any serious critic to present this performance blindly to a listener familiar with the opera, but not necessarily the cast.  With the cast being anonymous, I guarantee you this performance will be judged as being substandard.

Further, Nilsson was never a great actress.  No one here can tell me that a 62 year old woman is ""throwing herself"" into the role.

Anyone who claims this is a magnificent performance simply calls his or her credibility into question.",1256947200,8,930,4.8164556962025316
2615922,5,B000GPPPXQ,Phenomenal DVD! I've watched it 3 times since purchasing. I'm mesmerized by Nilsson's singing and acting...at age 62 in this performance. It's a real testament to her talent and abilities. Definitely glad I bought this. Should be in every opera lover's collection.,1232236800,3,264,5.309523809523809
2615923,3,B000GPPPXQ,"For me, Strauss' tale of ghastly family dysfunction has always been an opera better heard on record than seen in the opera house. Its hysterical atmosphere and bizarre characters, while providing tremendous opportunities for singers to display their power, range and stamina, also seem to encourage overacting and hamhanded emoting. Such is the case here. Mignon Dunn as Clytemnestra is the least offensive and actually delivers some truly beautiful singing. But soprano Rysanek whose histrionic skills--for reasons completely unclear to me--were considered non-pareil delivers another ourtrageous performance with excesses that seem based on the worst excesses of the silent screen era. Donald MacIntyre as Orest sings decently but visually is just ridiculous. Nilsson is past her vocal prime but at least does not embarass herself as do her colleagues. To her credit she underplays much of her role allowing the fevered music to make all of the necessary points. Even so, without the benefit of aesthetic distance, the viewer can see a certain calculatedness to her movements, a quality that belies the out-of-control emotionalism that she is trying to portray. The star of this show is Levine whose conducting is all that that one could wish for. As I suggested earlier, there are certain operas that call for physical acting skills that are just beyond the abilities of the average and even great singer. Watch Renee Fleming's Blanche DuBois in Previn's ""Streetcar Named Desire"" for a recent example. While vocally they can be quite pleasing and even thrilling, the talent to translate their musical gifts into believable behavioral action is not always theirs to command. Unfortunately, I feel that many of we opera fans have learned to settle for and accept second rate and really rather silly exibitions as examples of great art. No wonder Callas seemed so revolutionary.",1222041600,3,1878,5.2842809364548495
2615924,5,B000GPPPXQ,"Thank you very much to the Met for this beautiful production, specially for the amazing Nilsson and his partner the incomparable Rysanek. You will enjoy every moment and every note.",1204156800,3,181,5.066666666666666
2615925,5,B000GPPPXQ,"I thought I would add some corrections:

1. this performance was not Nilsson's return to the MET after a five year absence. Her first Elektra in 1980 was on February 1 and this recording is from February 16.

2. this performance was not ""cut"" due to her vocal condition but observes the standard cuts the MET has always followed. There never has been a note complete perfomance of Elektra at the MET (and rarely at any other opera house and on few recordings)

3. This was not Nilssons last fully staged opera performance at the MET -the following year (1981) she sang some performances of Die Frau ohne Schatten singing the Dyer's Wife.",1176768000,11,637,4.619469026548672
2615926,4,B000GPPPXQ,"Both Nilsson and Rysanek (sick and with high fever) are not in their prime, but WHAT a great piece of THEATRE! Nilsson's involvment in this role is overwhelming too such a degree that you can ignore that her voice sounds a bit worn. The public roars - and rightly so. If you want to experience Nilsson as one of the truly great actors of the operatic scene, buy this DVD at once. I was deeply moved and cried at the end.",1176249600,10,420,4.197530864197531
2615927,3,B000GPPPXQ,"This is a February 1980 live performance from the Met, with optional English subtitles.

The staging is the rather traditional and appropriate cavelike or dungeon setting. Costumes for Elektra (Birgit Nilsson) and her sister Chrisothemis (Leonie Rysanek) are also bland, which is probably also appropriate for those who have been held prisoner for some years. Klytemnestra, Elektra's mother (Mignon Dunn) wears the very colorful vestiments befitting a self-indulgent queen.

Now comes the hard part: I found Birgit Nilsson's voice to be at times wobbly and sometimes shrieking. It might be a personal preference, as the character Elektra certainly has a lot to shriek about. And yes, it was a live performance, near the end of Nilsson's career, but the DVD notes do proclaim ""her vocal powers are as glorious as ever."" Personally, I was disappointed in what sounded like inconsistent singing.

On the other hand, her dramatic powers were impressive. Nilsson was totally involved throughout the entire opera, and her gestures and facial reactions to the other characters added tremendously to the overall impact. We should remember that she was a pioneer between the time when opera singers tended to stand stiffly and sing, into today's era where we expect acting and reacting which the camera's eye allows us to see.

This performance features an extremely dramatic finale where Nilsson and Rysanek both collapse and die--it is dramatic and moving, and brings down the house at the Met.",1164326400,25,1487,5.235294117647059
8133807,5,B000GPPPXQ,This is a stunning performance - it blows your mind!  I saw several performances with Nilsson-Rysanek-Resnik back in the day and it was the greatest musical theater I ever saw or heard.  It was vocally superb on the part of the 3 principals (in this case Mignon Dunn sang Klaetemnestra. The only complaint I have is that the sets were very dark and so the video is the same.  But it doesn't matter - this is the great Nilsson in one of her greatest roles.  I accept it for what it is.  I don't know why Decca and DGG didn't make videos of her RING cycle - they could have done it in Bayreuth in '66 or at the Metropolitan in '74.  The technology was available then.,1520640000,,665,4.196850393700787
8133808,5,B000GPPPXQ,"No question about it - Nilsson was unequaled in the role of Elektra.  That she was caught here late in the game (she was in her 60s) is regrettable but doesn't negate the value of this release.  I was at this performance, and later saw it on television when this video was first shown. Seeing it again after many years, it's still an overwhelming experience, and I'm grateful to have it.  Rysanek was very sick when this was taped, but you can't tell it. Her feverish Chrysothemis is well known - she owned this role for decades, and here you can see why.. Mignon Dunn is wonderful. Anyone wanting to hear Nilsson at her best should check out the Solti recording, but this video is also a worthy souvenir of a great afternoon at the Met. The production is grim and forgettable. The performance, one for the ages.

There are several nice bonuses included: a couple of subsequent Nilsson appearances at the Met, in 1986 and 1996, and the complete curtain call for the Elektra performance. How well I remember that!",1505606400,,1012,4.574585635359116

8133811,5,B000GPPPXQ,The best Elektra ever.  And I saw it at the Met. back then.,1462752000,,59,3.5384615384615383
8133812,4,B000GPPPXQ,"Most people who are negative about the performance say it's not dramatic enough, or the singing is not consistent. Keep in mind these ladies came from a generation of opera singers who stood in place while performing, so they use a different kind of acting, and they are past their prime, Nilsson more so than Rysanek.

What makes this performance great is that for once, we have an impression of Birgit on video in a ""full"" performance of Elektra, and by full I mean with the usual cuts made to Elektra for performances. If you have Solti's recording with her, you know how great she sounded in her prime, but here, she sounds ok, but her performance was great, even though she didn't run around the stage and dance like a crazy woman, she did give it her all, especially for her age. She's a trooper, and quite the lady.

Leonie is always great, she really feels the part of the sister, because in real life I think they had a sister-like bond, this carries through. Rysanek was her Chrysothemis, as ""Nilsson is my Elektra"" as she said in an interview. Leonie's voice still sounds good for her age, it doesn't waver much, but she went on for another 14 years to do Salome with Malfitano, so she was still around for a while.

All in all I only recommend this DVD if you've never seen Nilsson and Rysanek together on stage in Elektra, because there will never be a pair like these two again. Two greats who tore the house down with their performance, despite it's flaws in it's appearance and the vocal decline, but for once, we see these two great veteran opera singers on video together in the roles of these sisters.",1419811200,,1620,4.4847457627118645
8133813,5,B000GPPPXQ,"Even though Nilsson and Rysanek were running the last laps of their glorious careers in the roles of Elektra and Chrysothemis, this DVD is a testimonial of how to sing this tremendous work. Levine is formidable, and Mignon Dunn as Klytmnestra holds her own in the confrontation scene with Elektra. A great buy.",1415750400,,310,4.867924528301887

8133815,5,B000GPPPXQ,"Birgit Nilson has a strong soaring voice which produces a very powerful presentation of the Greek tragedy. All of the parts were done well, great staging and acting. Richard Strauss is not a composer I am fond of because he starts a melody and chops it off with a different one abruptly. However, in Elektra he has created a timeless masterpiece of haunting melody.",1371168000,,365,4.71875
8133816,5,B000GPPPXQ,"I am a great fan of the mighty Birgit Nilsson especially her interpretation of Strauss' Elektra. I originally bought the Pioneer Company DVD 10 years ago and was very disappointed with the sound and picture quality.

However, I just recently borrowed this  DVD from my local public library noticing it had been reissued by Deutsche Grammaphone (DG).  What a difference! I bought a copy the next day!

The sound has been remastered and the picture quality refined. The DG remastering is amazing. You can hear all the singers and the orchestra quite well. The video quality is excellent considering this performance is from 1980.

The DVD also includes bonus material such as
1. The 20 minutes of curtain calls after the performance.
2. Nilsson singing Isolde's Narration and an encore ""When I was seventeen"" from the Met Centennial Gala 1983
3. Birgit's tribute to James Levine at his 25 anniversary gala that includes a speech and a HO-JO-TO from Walkure!
4. Two audio interviews.

I have read all of the reviews on Amazon and I agree the older DVD is terrible! The new Deutsche Grammaphone is remastered and quite good. As well, it is true that Nilsson is past her prime in this performance and has a few pitch and control problems but the overall performance is very good. Nilsson sings beautifully and every now and then that powerful steely laser like Nilsson voice appears and blows you away!

This new remastered version is a must for Nilsson and Elektra fans!",1351209600,3,1466,4.816733067729084
