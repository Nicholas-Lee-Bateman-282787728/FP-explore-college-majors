8488056,4,B005WOAE0K,"The Amazon description is a bit mashed together, but it says this set contains these 6 dvds;
Care Bears to the Rescue Movie
Cheer, There & Everywhere
Helping Hearts
Flower Power
Tell-Tale Tummies
Bear Buddies

This newer version of Care Bears comes in 2 seasons & 4 cgi movies.
Each season is 26 episodes over 13 half hours, the final 4 episodes are recut versions of 2 direct-to-dvd episodes.
This leaves 48 episodes which were spread across 6 2-hour dvds with 8 episodes each.
I was hoping this set would be the core 6 episode dvds, but they threw one of the movies in instead.
