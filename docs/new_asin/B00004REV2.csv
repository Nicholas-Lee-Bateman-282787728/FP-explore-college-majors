1342086,1,B00004REV2,"I am an conservative evangelical Protestant Christian. I enthusiastically paid to see this movie and I really wanted to be able to praise it. But I honestly can't.
It pains me to say this, but this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was either wooden or over-the-top scenery-chewing. There was no plot; they just went down the list of biblical prophecies and contorted their ""story"" to illustrate them. And the producers tried to make a ""big"" movie with no money. As a result, they had to get their cast around the world with the kinds of tired and strained plot devices Hollywood gave up decades ago(see the tunnel sequence).
But the worst part of this movie was the ending. It would seem to me, that if one were making a movie about the final battle between good and evil, one might entertain the idea of having my Lord and Savior actually SHOW UP at the end. The Omega Code doesn't include Him as a character; the thing just kind of stops. Two friends of mine who saw it had no idea what the ending was supposed to mean and I have never, before or since, so desperately wanted to throw something at a movie screen.
If you want to see a good Christian movie, buy Zefferelli's Jesus of Nazareth or a copy of the Jesus Film. If you want to watch a movie in which Christian principles are honored, buy Chariots of Fire or The Apostle. Avoid this unless you want to know how NOT to make movies.",954115200,,1414,4.359848484848484
1342087,4,B00004REV2,The Omega Code was an excellent movie! It is great for christians that seek a good action movie. The acting is good not great but no less then some of the recent movie we have seen at the box office. I suggest you pick  this movie up today and share it with all your friends!,954115200,4,275,4.0

1342089,5,B00004REV2,"This picture helps the viewer put the books of Daniel and Revelation into a modern, realistic perspective.  I applaud TBN for finally supporting someone with the courage to step out and produce an entertaining work that  explains the prophecies of the Bible.  Don't let its lack of exposure keep  you from ordering this film.  Any movie fan will tell you that the size of  the bucks isn't necessarily in direct proportion to the value of the movie.  This presentation is great entertainment and an interesting conversation  piece for the buyer whether he is familiar with the Bible or not.  My DVD  is on the  way!",954028800,6,614,4.752380952380952

1342091,1,B00004REV2,"Promising premise. Bad Acting (hello! Casper Van Dien?Pluuueeese), badly executed story, horrible writing and weakdirecting. Enough said. See it if you want a laugh at the expense of Trinity Broadcasting.",953251200,15,204,5.833333333333333
1342092,5,B00004REV2,"After seeing the previews, viewing the web  site and listing to all the hype on TBN,  I really wanted to see this thriller.  The movie  stars Michael York and Casper Van Dien,  and has an intriguing title, The Omega  Code. The movie started out somewhat slow but  then picks up speed as you  are introduced  to the main characters and the plot of the  movie.  Dr.  Gillian Lane is a world famous  motivational speaker and mythology expert,  which really doesn't seem to fit Casper  Van Dien character in the  beginning of the  movie.  Stone Alexander (Michael York)  is the European  Union Chairman and also the  Antichrist.  The whole movie is based around  the biblical code that tells the future of what  is to come in the last  days.  In the whole movie  there are many different twists and turns  and  it is somewhat confusing at times to  those who really don't know any thing  about the end times.  You can tell the good  guys from the bad guys but  many people  have voiced on the Internet about how they  really don't  understand most of it,  but if you are a Christian and you have read  the  book of Revelation it won't be  confusing.  It isn't totally accurate about  the End Times, and dose leaves out the  Rapture and adds the whole bible  code  spin into it.  But despite all that, the movie  is much better then  the junk that  Hollywood is running today.  It will make some people think  about the movie  if they are ever left behind in the Rapture.
This isn't  the best movie, but it is the BEST Christian movie out there. Is there  anyone who disagrees?",951696000,62,1572,4.421428571428572
1342093,3,B00004REV2,"Having spent the better part of 18 years studying Bibleprophecy, I had high hopes for this film.  The production values areexcellent.  However, only a basic introduction to Bible Prophecy is given, and though the Bible Codes work well in the movie, I'm not convinced of their validity in this area.  Michael York gives the best performance of the lot and is most enigmatic as the manipulative world leader.  No suprises for the well-read prophecy student, but a basic introduction for the novice.  Though not perfect, it ranks among the better prophecy films produced.  Try to remember it was made for only $6.5 million dollars, which is 1/3 what some actors alone receive for starring in a film.",951350400,2,696,4.905982905982906

There is not one redeeming quality in the entire production. Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves for passing this off as entertainment. This film exposes the ""Christian film industry"" for the joke that it really is. And if you're the type of person to buy into the ""Bible code"" in the first place, then there really is no hope for you. A waste of film, to be sure.

It grabs your attention from the beginning and holds it to the end. As a matter of fact, when this movie hit the theaters, the news media called this the BLOCKBUSTER that Hollywood missed!!  You really will enjoy this movie. As far as the film not being biblically accurate - It's fictional movie that's based on the Bible - what part of the word fiction is so hard to understand?

Unfortunately, I have no idea what the ending was even about.  A big glowing light suddenly sweeps over the earth and then a shot of a computer printer printing out a message saying have a nice millenium.  Huh???  Watching this film, which must have been made to appeal to the biblical conspiracy theorists, was an agonizing experience and you can see why most of the actors careers obviously peaked before this film was made.",1325030400,,597,4.647619047619048
1342128,2,B00004REV2,"The movie is a common evangelical conception of what the book of Revelation means. The movie forgets some of the important aspects of the prophecy such as Wormwood poisoning 1/3 the waters and jumps right to the beast stuff. It uses a series of fake Bible Codes in order to make the prophecy of Revelation more convincing. The characters are hokey. People are either all good or all bad. The acting is soap-opera style of exaggeration to the point of being cartoonish. The whole idea that whoever controls Jerusalem controls the world is inane, even in the game of Risk.",1279756800,,570,4.71

1342132,1,B00004REV2,"When The Omega Code was released in 1999 - ironically, one of the best years for the cinema ever - Christians the world over were hyped that a film had finally been created for them - for them, and ONLY them. This was problem numero uno. In a year that gave us American Beauty and Magnolia, two extremely intelligent, redemptive, and moving films, The Omega Code came along and attempted to accomplish what those films had, only to lesser effect. You see, while The Omega Code may have redeeming qualities, it is neither intelligent nor moving. Aside from the fact that this film was tailored to a specific audience, leaving no room for a middle ground, it's a bit of a double whammy that the writing is lazy to the point of being horrendous. You wouldn't know that by reading the 'Christian' reviews, of course. They all felt obligated to call it one of the best films of the year. If you need proof, look no further than the DVD cover art. It's splattered with (hopefully) faux praise on the front cover, as well as the back. This film had everyone fooled. Yes, they worked on a limited budget. So did Darren Aronofsky. So did Henry Jaglom. So did David Lynch. So did Stanley Kubrick. You get the point.",1202169600,,1205,4.506849315068493
1342133,4,B00004REV2,"This movie is a suspense thriller about the discovery of the Bible's intangible secrets and hidden messages and the fight to control the world before the end of days. This suspense thriller take on the end times makes no mention of the so-called rapture. So this is more of a B-movie thriller. If you are a glutton for end time movies you will want to see this.

Casper Van Dien from Starship Troopers is the lead of this film. He plays opposite Michael York of Logan's Run and Michael Ironside of Starship Troopers. This is nothing like the ""Left Behind"" movies. The acting is good and it appears to have had some of its scenes shot on location in Jerusalem. There is nothing new with the idea of a code being hidden in the Bible. What is new is the fact that the Anti-Christ must solve the code in order to fulfill prophecy. Far fetched, yes, but an interesting premise.",1191283200,,872,4.45
1342134,3,B00004REV2,"It was watchable but not inspiring. The actors seemed good, however I think that it lacked depth. The plot was based on bible codes, which might have had more meaning if I believed in them.  Also it was missing a lot of other things that would have made it a good movie-such as a strong enough good guy (to counteract all of the bad guys that they had), better settings in some of the shots and much more Christianity.",1190419200,,418,4.291139240506329

1342136,2,B00004REV2,"OK, it's a here-comes-the-millenium, there-go-the-prophecies sort of flick. Micheal York is the grinning antichrist, but he's the only one I recognized. (The others may be happy not to be recognized.) This time, the oracular foretellings come from the bible code, that humorous exercise that proves that, once you get enough stuff piled together, bizarre coincidences become compulsory. Just to make sure that we really believe the oracle, it's a computer. We all know that computers are never wrong (or at least mighty hard to argue with), so the prophecies must be true.

And they keep springing out of the machine, with each one arriving at the moment when its message becomes dramatically necessary. I'm not sure how that bible figured out just which messages were needed when, since it was written so many thousands of years ago, but it got the times right to within about ten minutes. Dang, that's one smart bible. Not smart enough to deliver that final fortune cookie without the mysterious Omega Code being plugged in. Why biblical passages written in Hebrew needed a Greek code to open themselves up, I'll never know - but it just shows that the bible isn't just smart, it's sneaky.

Then, just when all the pieces come together, the movie stops. I don't mean that it ends, in the sense of having an ending. It just runs out of minutes and goes away. All we get is one final message saying, pretty much, ""Have a nice millenium.""

It could have been worse. That clever bible coder could have added a :) smiley. The movie probably had one until outraged theater owners started sending cleaning bills and orders for barf bags.

It stars Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers) as a motivational speaker who falls in with rising world leader Michael York (Logan's Run), unaware that the latter is manipulating world events using the ""Bible Code"" -- prophecies coded in the bible.

The acting is good and the story suspenseful enough to keep you interested.

1342141,3,B00004REV2,"The Omega Code is a rather strange film; a product of the Trinity Broadcasting Network, it is an Armageddon film that portrays the End Times with increasingly little regard to actual Biblical prophecy and only mentions Jesus once in passing.  Strictly as a film, it's not all that bad.  Sure, there are some plot holes and a few goofs, but the cast is surprisingly well-known and the special effects are actually pretty good (especially for a $7 million dollar film).  The real problem comes with the storyline and the tendency for lead players to ham it up.  Frankly, I don't really consider this a Christian film at all, as it basically just exploits the popularity of the dubious Bible code and wanders far afield from actual Biblical prophecy.

The ""hero"" of this film is, of all things, a motivational speaker named Gillen Lane (Casper Van Dien) who just happens to be an expert of sorts on the Bible Code (despite the fact he is in no way religious).  When we first meet him, he's jumping all over the furniture of a talk show set like Tom Cruise on Oprah, preaching his secular message of personal evolution through the proper mindset.  A short while later, he joins up with the fabulously rich philanthropist Alexander Stone (Michael York) to help make the world a better place.  Stone does so much good for less fortunate people that he is appointed chairman of the European Union.  Stone isn't what he seems, however; as we in the audience know, he has gone to great lengths, including murder, to acquire the key to the biblical Omega Code.  By reading the computer-generated prophecies of the code, he determines what to do and when to do it.  So it is that he sets his Jerusalem Plan in motion, blowing up the Tomb of the Rock, only to swoop in and do the impossible: secure a genuine peace deal between Israel and Palestine.  As part of the seven-year deal, he pledges to rebuild the Tomb of the Rock as well as Solomon's Temple side by side on the Temple Mount.  Lane is with him all the way, handling all of the PR.  Stone's henchman (Michael Ironside), a former priest turned bodyguard/hit man, gets jealous of Lane's influence and kills Stone, pinning the blame on Lane.  While Lane is on the run, though, a miracle happens: Stone is resurrected (luckily, the hospital folks had just left him in a private room still hooked up to monitors for untold hours after declaring him deceased).  Stone's resurrection only adds to his fame and influence.  When he says the world needs one government, nations get in line to kiss his hand.  Nationalism just vanishes overnight, which is absurd; there's certainly no way America would just sit idly by and let some pasty European become king of the world.

During his coronation inside the brand new Jerusalem Temple, Stone goes far beyond proclaiming himself king; he actually declares himself God.  At that point, all masks are pretty much off, with Stone pledging to annihilate any nations who oppose his leadership.  The only thing Stone lacks is the final piece of the Omega Code, crucial data which just so happens to fall in Lane's hands.  There is one pretty effective plot twist that brings Stone and Lane back together at the end, but it's hard to categorize the ultimate conclusion as a contest between ultimate good and ultimate evil.

As a Christian, I have to say that this movie does not carry any sort of effective Christian message at all.  While it does draw some material from actual Biblical prophecy, it increasingly goes its own way, relying on insipid pronouncements from its fictional Omega Code to push the apocalyptic story forward.  Jesus and the Gospel are almost completely ignored altogether.  To me, this is the kind of Biblical prophecy film that non-religious writers would produce - yet its origins lie with the Trinity Broadcasting Network, and that is what makes the whole movie experience somewhat unsettling.  In the end, you're basically left with special effects and an increasingly sensationalist story to carry the day.  As such, The Omega Code, whatever its origins and purported intentions, really does little to distinguish itself from all manner of End of Days films coming out of Hollywood in the last decade.  Don't consign this film to viewers here in the Bible Belt, as it really doesn't have all that much to offer Christians.",1120262400,18,4333,4.786290322580645
1342142,1,B00004REV2,"My, my, my, if only there was something below a rating of 1. I am, admittedly, not a student of the Bible, so I can only offer my opinion of ""The Omega Code"" as a stand-alone film. And that opinion is low indeed. From the start, Omega Code is obviously a religiously centered movie, and yet it seems to want so bad to be secular. Slick camera shots, two big name leads, and the ""action flick"" format seem to scream ""Look at us! We're making a secular film with Christian subject matter! We've done the impossible!"" But rather than intelligently weaving religious aspects into an already strong movie, the filmmakers seem to treat the mainstream and biblical elements of Omega Code like the hot and cold water in a broken gas station sink. Sometimes it'll be hot, sometimes cold, but never properly mixed. And in this case, neither are well executed separately either. So we're left with a motion picture that spends half its time on mind-numbingly boring biblical diatribe and the other half on mind-numbingly boring hackneyed action scenes. Don't get me wrong. ""The Ten Commandments"" among other films has proven that the words of the Bible don't have to be boring. But in this film, boring is all they can hope to be. In fact boring is the operative word in this flick. Boring boring boring. So boring, that even when attempting to lampoon it with a friend of mine, we were quickly silenced by the sheer mesmerizing tedium taking place on screen. How could a movie with so many explosions be so boring? I'll tell you how. 1) It doesn't respect its audience. 2) It was ill structured and ill conceived. 3) It was clearly written by a mentally-challenged orangutan. Final thoughts? This thing makes ""Batman and Robin"" look like ""The Sting"".",1118793600,7,1740,4.7081967213114755
1342143,3,B00004REV2,"After reading some of the other reviews, I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I actually enjoyed this movie.  Admittedly, I was not expecting a lot, as it was part of a ""4 DVD's for $6.00"" deal that I got at my local video rental store.

I liked this movie much more than ""Left Behind"".  The plot was OK (if somewhat at the TV Soap level), the special effects pretty good, and the scenes of Jerusalem and Rome were nice.  I liked all the actors from previous roles I had seen them in.  I particularly liked the Angelic guys who kept showing up to screw up Michael York's evil plans.

Considering the source of the movie (Trinity Broadcasting Network), I'm surprised that it turned out this good.  Look folks, it's just a movie.  It kept my interest and was actually entertaining.  When you realize how many really bad movies are created every year, this one is far from the worst.

In the ""End-Times Soap Opera"" genre, The Omega Code is fine.  I have seen several movies by Christian movie companies on this subject that are really, really dreadful.

This movie attempts to deal with the issue of the finite nature of our world (and our own personal lives) in a manner digestible by those not familiar with the concept.  If it got a few people to think about something beyond this life, than it served a good purpose.",1114387200,2,1317,4.506329113924051

It's sad when Christians feel they have to support such a bad movie because the ""message"" jives with what they believe. Don't get me wrong. I'm not bashing the message. I don't agree with it, but that doesn't mean I don't think it deserves to be seen and heard. Goodness knows there's room for more positive portrayals of Christianity and moral values in movies.

However, supporting bad films with good messages is only going to encourage more bad films. Support what you like in a movie--the positive story, the lack of gore, the lack of language--that's fine. But don't lower your standards just because you're desperate for good movies. Bad writing is bad writing--whether it's porn, a head-bashing action flick, an off-color comedy, or a Christian-friendly film. Bad acting (and Casper Van Dien may be bad acting's poster child) can mess up the best of movies--to say nothing about a film with weak plotting and writing to begin with. Please, please, PLEASE stop supporting trash just because it happens to fit your worldview. If you want your views better represented, demand more--demand better. Don't settle.

[And, I'm off my soapbox now]

A movie with (I'm guessing here) about a five-million dollar budget should NOT try for big explosions. The special effects look like an episode of something off the Sci-Fi Channel, and that only takes away from any story the movie might be trying to tell.

As for the story itself. It's sloppy, it's pretentious, and it doesn't make sense. I've read the Bible and enough Christian books (including end-times literature), to understand what's going on. I can't even imagine having to sit through the movie without that background. As it is, this is a weird mix of Christian pre-millienialism and pseudo-kabbalistic jibberish.

He delivers his usual better-than-average ""bad guy"" portrayal.

1342149,4,B00004REV2,"Some of this film may be ridiculous, but it is always highly diverting, with a marvelous over-the-top performance from Michael York, after he rises from his fatal head wound, somewhat reminiscent of a Frankenstein birth.

 It has a rather preposterous End Times plot, with a computer spewing out prophesy from a Bible Code program. The film begins with this explanation of the Bible Code: ""A mathematical phenomenon whose hidden messages are said to contain the whole of human history"" (and there is much debate in the ""real world"" with scholars who are attempting to explain or evaluate the Bible Code), and that ""He who controls Jerusalem in the last days, controls the world"". Hal Lindsay, of ""The Late Great Planet Earth"" fame, is given credit as ""Bible Prophesy Consultant"" for the film.

 The characters:

 Michael York is the Bad Guy, media mogul and world manipulator Stone Alexander, who though not quite as brilliantly unconstrained as in the sequel to this film ""Megiddo - Omega Code 2"", nevertheless puts on quite a show. A must see for those who enjoy flamboyant Ham & Cheese Deluxe on film.

 Casper Van Diem, is Gillen Lane, a ""motivational guru"", who I found quite insipid to start with, but as the film unfolds, and his part becomes more physical (running and jumping fences, etc.) he is stronger and more likable.

 Catherine Oxenberg is Cassandra, who seems to magically appear whenever Lane is in trouble, to supposedly save him from his relentless pursuers. She's an annoying little vixen, who does wonders for plot progression.

 Michael Ironside is Dominic, who is Alexander's hit man, and much more, and is very good at being rotten to the core.

 The unnamed prophets are played by Jan Triska and Gregory Wagrowski, and they do a fine job as Prophet 1 and Prophet 2.

 Filmed on location in Italy and Israel, the cinematography by Carlos Gonzalez is terrific, and some of the special effects quite well done. Part nicely paced dramatic thriller, part awful B movie, and 100% good entertainment, the total running time is 1 hour and 40 minutes.",1090454400,3,2068,4.882521489971347

It begins with a man (Michael Ironside, prostituting himself for cash) shooting a monk SITTING BEHIND A F**KING LAPTOP with a silencer and then being apprehended by to men who give him his hat and let him go.  These guys are angels.  Praise the Lord.
It spirals into the worst cinematic attempt at a Biblical message I have ever seen.  The funniest parts involve the Antichrist, this idiotic English guy who can't act and takes over the world in, ah, about a week.  But wait!  Jesus comes to save the day!

Also, I'm glad that they didn't go too hollywood. A chase was just a chase and not an excuse to blow up half a city. (Of course that came later.) I love horror, and I've always loved a good story about the end of the world (the ultimate horror).
Being an atheist, I tend to regard the bible as mythology (I don't say this to offend), and mythology can be used very nicely as springboard for horror (witness Lovecraft, etc.).",1068336000,,557,4.264150943396227
1342153,5,B00004REV2,"The Omega Code is an instant epic masterpiece in the Christian movie industry in my opinion. It depicts the final days of world history as portrayed in the prophetic Scripture books of Revelation and Daniel. The makers of Omega Code uses these books as a guide in forming the basic structures of the plot, infusing accuracy as well as vivid realism.
The two greatest aspects of this film is the truly excellent character development and the accurate portrayal of the end-times. The cast is absolutely perfect. The two best performances in my opinion are that of Casper Van Dien and Michael York. Casper Van Dien stars as a famous motivational speaker who seeks to unlock the mystery of the Bible Code. He is under the potently strong influence of one Stone Alexander (Michael York) who desires to mentor his young supporter on how to become a world leader. Little does the young doctor know that Stone Alexander will soon rule Jerusalem and ultimately the entire world, as prophesied by the books of Revelation and Daniel. The young doctor soon finds himself desperately seeking to escape Alexander, seeing him for what he really is: a potent personification of evil. He is the one who signs a covenant of peace with Israel and soon acquires worldwide acclaim as a divine savior. As the world is drawn in by the evil deceptions of Stone Alexander, there is an intense struggle going on between several main characters to acquire the final apocalyptic code, which is missing from the databanks of underground decoding technology labs. The Antichrist (who of course turns out to be Stone Alexander) is a leader in this struggle. The young doctor finds himself encountering the adventure of a lifetime. Not only must he survive the horrors of the end-times, but he must also confront the Antichrist and reveal him as what he truly is: an evil deciever indwelt by Satan himself. During the course of his experiences he also eventually finds salvation through Jesus Christ and frees himself from evil forces seeking to threaten his destiny.
The Omega Code is a brilliant, extremely well done film that vividly depicts God's plan concerning the end of the world. The movie climaxes with the death of the evil Antichrist and his False Prophet, and the return of Christ to the planet to establish the divine millenial reign of Christ and His saints. The Omega Code is a movie accurately and vividly depicting the spectacular struggle between good and evil. Filmed in the religious capitals of Jerusalem and Rome. PG-13 for strong thematic principles and violence. 5 stars.",1059782400,2,2564,4.910138248847926
1342154,2,B00004REV2,"The producers of this movie were so focused on getting their Message across that they forgot about making a movie.  I would liken it to adapting one of Shakespeare's longer plays to the screen.  Obviously there are scenes that must be cut; a good director and screenwriter will know how to adapt the play to the screen, so that the storyline remains intact, but still entertaining to the movie audience.  The producers of the Omega Code were so busy, scupulously dotting their Scriptural i's and crossing the Scriptural t's, that they produced a movie that bogs down under its own ponderous weight.
It isn't as though Revelation, as weird as it can get sometimes, doesn't provide some good material for a movie.  Though lacking in narrative in the same sense as Acts, for example (now there is a rollicking good time, just waiting to be made into a movie!), the vivid images it provides should be enough for a competent production team to employ with some success.

It is safe to say that if you think that your a christian but do not understand the message, then you are not a true christian but a self proclaim one who thinks they are real christians.

1342156,1,B00004REV2,"I thought this movie was not only horribly, painfully, awfully bad, but also offensive. Lets break this down into bullet points:
-Plot: This is the least bad of the points Ill go over. Its a somewhat interesting idea. One major problem is that the Biblical code they use seems to involve writing passages in a grid, with no spaces, and then picking letters in a regular, mathematical pattern to get messages. This is actually a genuine trick used in Judaic mysticism, and I believe also Islamic mysticism. There are a few errors, though. First off, its shown once being done in English. The Old Testament wasn't done in English. It was in Hebrew or Jewish Aramaic. Further, this trick only works well in those languages because the vowels are not written. The consonants carry unwritten vowels. This makes puzzles like this work well in Semitic languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Aramaic, etc.). Now, what I immediately noticed is that this little ""trick"" is portrayed as if the Jews never realized it, even though theyve been doing it for millennia. A Christian, who doesnt seem to speak Hebrew or Aramaic, has to figure it out using English (see point above), and ""show them the light"".
-Acting: I cringe using that word here. ""Acting"" implies that people actually act, or have some talent at it. The most interesting characters were the two angels, and the devil. The angels were, in my opinion, under-used. (I was also sad to see that they didn't pull out any Old Testament style smiting. I was looking forward to seeing a special effects loaded can of Righteous Wrath being opened at some point in the movie.) I actually ended up sympathizing with the devil because that was the only character who showed *any* acting skill. Everyone else ranged from cardboard props to annoying.
- Music and Setting: Nice. Nothing special. Ok. However, some of the props used lead to.
- Message: The message I got was, ""Other religions are just fumbling around, waiting for a Christina leader to show them whats really going on...The movie is none-too-subtle about Catholic bashing. If you look closely, the only visibly Catholic character is an ex-priest who was de-frocked for murder, or homosexuality, or both, and who is in knowing service of Satan. If you look even closer, the big golden thingy on the Devils desk is called a ""monstrum"". Its a sacramental used to hold a Eucharistic host for public adoration and some benedictions. They are found in Catholic churches. (Im not sure about Anglican.) They are something distinctly Catholic, and the Devil uses one to decorate his desk.
So, overall, the movie is horrible. I found the Catholic-bashing in a ""Christian"" movie particularly offensive. I thought the portrayal of other religions was demeaning. The acting was horrible. The whole thing is worse than a waste of time.",1050364800,27,2812,4.909663865546219

1342158,1,B00004REV2,"When I saw the previews for this movie (as expected for everyone else, too), I thought it was going to be an action-packed apocalyptic film about Christ's second coming. Instead, it's about an eccentric preacher who is on the run from all the satanists, and from the anti-christ himself (Michael York). At first I was very enthusiastic about it all, but I was still reluctant to go see it in theaters. So, I waited for it to be available to rent, and got myself to Blockbuster and checked it out. Within half an hour of the beginning of the movie, I was incredibly bored. It took WAY too long to get into the thick of the plot, and even then it was sadly disappointing. I seriously think the writers of this one need to go back and study the book of Revelations much more thoroughly. ""The Omega Code"" is more like a poorly interpreted version of the coming armageddon. Although the film itself had decent acting, it lacked any well-constructed storyline. They bypassed biblical prophecies and jumped straight into the new-age of dehumanization. As for myself, I'm not all that religious, but I do believe strongly in God, and I have read 'Revelations' numerous times. I consider the bible a guide to life, not a nest for someone to pluck fairytales from so they can produce a revenue. If they wanted to make a *realistic* movie about the coming of the anti-christ, and the end of the world (in biblical aspects), they should've had a far more heavy budget to work with. Special effects don't make a movie like this; it needed a much more in-depth plot, better prophetical implications, and not so many spoofs from ""The Fugitive"". I've suffered a great misfortune by seeing this disaster of a movie.",1040169600,,1698,4.663333333333333
1342164,1,B00004REV2,"I must admit that although this movie is stunningly bad, I oddly enough enjoyed it.  As a person who is not terribly religious, I can still appreciate good actors trying very hard to make a bad movie good.  Kudos to Michael York and Michael Ironsides in that respect.  York shows off his acting talents while delivering the silliest lines ever, and Ironsides does his usual badass performance as an intense gun toting bodyguard and #2,  his outfit seemingly lifted straight from Schwarzeneggers ""Total Recall"".  I guess all bad dudes wear leather blazers, who knew.  There is one line that he says with a straight face that is so hilarious I can't even mention it....you must watch the flick yourself I won't give it away.  As for Casper Van Dien, his acting ability has the depth of a kiddie pool.  This is verified by his wonderfully bad role in ""Starship Troopers"".
I can credit christians for one thing....they toned down the violence and had the decency to make the camera cut away when York was shot in the head.  Too many hollywood flicks seem to have an orgasmic love of 'head shots', something I personally don't consider entertainment.
If you are a christian you will love this DVD.  If you aren't, well you might still like it.  Have an open mind, remember Harrison Ford wasn't available.
The ending was kinda disappointing, but I guess they had to stick to prophecy and avoid a hollywood version.  It ends on a good note of sorts.",1037664000,4,1442,4.678571428571429

I recommend this movie as a thought-provoker and interesting idea. Again, you do not have to believe in the Bible Codes to enjoy the movie, nor do you have to agree with every detail of theology.

1342166,5,B00004REV2,"Movie reviewers have to tell readers up front if they are going to give away a movie's plot and ending.
But what if the plot and ending is the FUTURE EVENTS OF MANKIND?
This movie, the Omega Code dares to take the viewer on a forbidden journey------INTO OUR IMMEDIATE FUTURE----without flinching until the very end. More on this later.
The Bible has been with us since Guttenberg created the mass produced book, in fact it was the other way around, the word created the printing press, and the free reformation society we have enjoyed for over 500 years. However, at the dawn of the 21st century the personal computer has unlocked that a supernatural hand wrote the Bible embedding a code of future events that in this film, schlock self-help guru played by Casper van Diem has toyed with to get-rich-quick. His public self-empowerment efforts has captured the attention of a world peace philanthropist played by Michael York. Be advised as you watch this film to ask yourself who is using who? What may seem to be predictable plot is not what it appears.
Before we discovered the Bible code, we could have always simply READ the book of Revelation to learn how the end times (the Omega, last letter of the greek alphabet) will unfold. Frankly, readers and viewers ""do not want to go there"". To take us where we don't want to go, the scriptwriters have used the Bible code to revolve the action instead of the direct approach. Michael York has all along been basing his actions on the Bible code in order to eliminate having to take any real risks; as he says ""he always leaves himself a way out"" and become the ruler of the European Union. Those actions are to unify the world and make him the one world government leader, the anti-christ, the man of sin imitating God (777) but falling short (666). However, he needs a good ""PR man"" and van Diem is it. Or is he? The movie takes us from the destruction of the Islamic dome of the rock to the rebuilding of a mosque and temple mount for Judaism (both sides get something) to the anti-christ declaring HE is the god of this world.
This is not a game, nor is this just a movie. This is a warning of what is to come.
In the most chilling scene in the movie, before becoming the world's quasi-benevolent dictator, Michael York has died from a gunshot wound received when van Diem escapes from his lair shown with a hospital vital signs ""flatline"". However, as van Diem and TV reporter/helper Oxenburg escape in a business jet which throttles up for take-off, the anti-christ's vital signs come to life. Alive, though declared dead to the world, what was before a self-ambitious man is now been indwelt by Satan and when his chief henchman enters the room (played by Michael Ironside) he lets him know WHO IS THE BOSS....you will almost wet your pants, its that scary. Its scary because most Americans have read the Bible (to include the book of Revelation---they just don't want to ""go there"") and this is no science fiction flight of fancy as turning on your TV and seeing events in the middle east proves. Its TRUE. Its going to happen someday in our near future, and the word ""creepy"" is not strong enough here.
Americans from recent polls sense trouble in the future on a global scale and are apprehensive; at the very end this film falters--I'm sure on purpose---from showing the actual last 3.5 years of the anti-christ's reign on earth where WWIII will break out. The film implies that God, Jesus Christ will return before WWIII and the plagues on mankind are poured out, which is incorrect but probably is as far as you can take an American audience. At this point they have seen and heard more than they have bargained for. So don't let me spoil the real ending here; go find a King James Bible and read the book of Revelation as-is and learn the actual ending of the story that this outstanding, daring movie begins.",1030752000,2,3873,4.582132564841499

The translation, which tells of the past, present, and future, is also predicted to hold the blueprint of the universe.  To better use the information, Stone keeps knowledge of it secret.
Caspar Van Dien plays a motivational speaker and scholar, Dr. Lane, who initially works with Stone.  Towards the end of the movie, he will have a conversion that keeps him on the side of righteousness.

The film may be execrable, but at least it's never dull. Non-fundamentalists might prefer to view it as an anthropological document (or a psychoanalytic diagnosis) than as a legitimate cinematic narrative, especially given that a sizable number of Americans think the story here is practically Gospel truth.

Watch, if you must, for the film's not-so-latent racism and geopolitical ignorance -- more sources of accidental humor than legitimate targets for outrage. And aren't those Catholic bishops dolled up in Greek Orthdox robes? As Boris Badinov would say, ""Hoo boy.""

Thank the Trinity Broadcasting Network for those 100 minutes of your life that you just wasted.  The folks at TBN, of all people, should know that any a movie about the power of God that doesn't have George Burns listed in the credits, is a bad idea.
I'm having a hard time deciding what is more preposterous - the thought of a book that predicts every major event in world history, or the fact that Casper Van Dien still has a job.  While the plot of ""The Omega Code"" would be mildly interesting if they passed it off as fiction, the movie turns into a convoluted and frustrating mess once they try to convince you that secret codes actually exist in the Torah.

I could not bring myself to review this movie personally, but I thought I would share my kids reactions.
By the way my kids are 11 and 8, have a religious upbringing but are aware of what goes on in the world.

My tastes probably run contrary to the ""true believer"" but I count Prophecy I and II, the Omen, 7th Sign, Prince of Darkness and Pi as good, original takes on the Biblical theme.  Those who LOVE Omega Code probably won't like these movies cuz they may seem ""heretical"" or not in keeping with the strict Bible texts.  Those who hated Omega Code might, just might, love these movies.
Cabalists and codesearchers might be interested in the book ""Foucalt's Pendulum"" by the same author whose book ""Name of the Rose"" became such an unpopular film (which I loved, by the way).
Omega Code sounded really intriguing on the back of the DVD case, but I found myself surprised that I was actually able to sit thru the whole movie; it was painful.  Van Dien, Ironsides (I love him ever since Scanners), and York are not bad, acting-wise, but the way the plot plays out and the overly predictable events made me wince.
This movie essentially took Pi's premise and oversimplified it, making cheesy ""cap'n crunch"" codewheel decipherings of ancient texts and creating simplistic ""prophecies"" out of them.
I didn't mind the low budget or the so called bad special effects or even the bad acting (except maybe the blond talk show chick - she really really annoyed me up til I found out she was a bad-guy).
Notable surprises:  the blond talk show chick is a baddie.
Notable negative points:  sometimes I can't understand the two prophets cuz their accents are so bad.  Couldn't we have found a couple of english speaking jews from America?  One of them was so bad I had to constantly rewind the DVD to understand him.
I also happen to be somewhat of a science-head who believes in evolution (only cuz there is too much proof to refute it).  If God exists, I think He created a beautiful symphony of physical laws and cause-and-effect in our universe.  Things didn't just appear in a flash.  We see examples of evolution happening in front of our faces in scientific studies everyday.  Just cuz the Bible (translated, after all, by essentially primitive-society Humans) doesn't discuss certain modern scientific truths, doesn't mean they aren't true, or that He didn't ordain these truths (the earth is, after all, round)

the truth is that the one original thing this movie had going for it, it simply let fall to the ground in a shameful heap of crumpled of kleenex. that is the concept. the story should have carried this movie from beginning to end and made it memorable regardless of all the other film elements. it is that good and creative a storyline. however, the movie ignores what could have been done with such a concept and adopts cliched movie violence and excitement instead. of course, the violence and excitement only serve as head-ache inducing snore-pills. the omega code does what it should never have been able to do: makes you wish you'd spent two hours of your life watching paint dry, or ants walk through grass.

At least Jack Chick is obvious in his hatred of the Catholic Church; this film tries to be subtle when it bashes Catholics and Orthodox Christians.  There was no good reason for Michael Ironside's character to have been a former priest and despite how Jack Chick may pervert the Bible, the Catholic Church has nothing to do with the anti-Christ.

But let's get something straight.  This movie omitted far too many important prophecies.  Where was the rapture?  Or the mark of the beast?  They were left out because of the effect they might have on the characters.
The other problem with this movie is that it's impossible to understand.  I was raised in a bible home, I've always studied the Bible, and I still don't get some of this movie.  There's a scene on an airplane where Casper Van Dien goes into this long, insignificant babble about some kind of 69 ladder wrungs and the top one is missing, or something like that.

Some of the special effects in the movie are lame but big deal.  The biblical interpretation of the end times are not horrible.  I did not feel that this movie radically departed from what is biblically possible for the end times.
Though I personally enjoy the Left Behind series better, this movie really does have a lot of similarities to Left Behind.  The main fault with the movie, though, is that there IS no mention of people left behind!  The writers of the film included no rapture in the film as far as I could tell.
It's not a bad movie though.  Would I spend my money on it again, knowing what I know now?  I probably would.  Should you spend your money on it?  I think so.

Michael York, what on earth was he thinking?  I kept  thinking to myself... gee, he certainly makes a better Tybalt (original  Romeo & Juliet film) than Satan, even if both characters are  villainous.  He seemed so campy in his role, overexaggerated to the point  of silliness.
Some of the plot was mildly interesting and the special  effects were cool.  I think that's where the 1 star comes in to justify  that.  I made the mistake of spending money to watch this in the theatre.  I wish I had only wasted a dollar to rent it instead.

I hate to  say that it seems like this film was merely an attempt to try to imitate  Hollywood films with all the fancy special effects and explosions but, in  my opinion, what matters most in a christian film is the message of  Salvation that it contains, not all the glitsy special effects.

True, the acting isn't  going to bring you to tears...and there are holes in the plot that cause  you to scratch your head.  However, there was one thing about this movie  that I liked.  When Stone (The lead character) is being tormented by demons  in his cell, he calls out to God and JESUS...and the demons vanished.  This, I must say, is very cool and actually did bring me to tears.  I was  a bit confused in places, and the ending smacked me in the face it was so  abrupt...but overall, this movie is worth watching, if just to see if it is  as bad as some of these reviews make it out to be.

Sorry.  Revelation is one of my favorite  books of the Bible and I couldn't wait to see this interpretation of the  End. I wasn't disappointed. Also, it was absorbing and entertaining seeing  the future in pictures instead of words. I enjoyed seeing  something truly  in line with Christianity and not something produced by a bunch of  Hollywood types like the recent tv shows on Christ. What a joke. This movie  travels along at a breathneck pace as scripture is fullfilled in the last  days.

1342305,2,B00004REV2,"...how little I enjoyed this movie when I saw that professional Bible pseudo-expert Hal Lindsey was at the spiritual reins.
This is one of those cocky self-proclaiming ""Christian"" films, produced under  the apparent assumption that its intent (which, according to one of the  stuntmen in the ""making of"" section, at least, is to ""save  souls"") justifies its poor acting, muddy story line, and atrocious  Biblical scholarship.  Yes, there is a Bible.  And yes, you can discover  some pretty interesting juxtapositions by selecting certain letters from  its original texts.  But is this film really, in the words of actor  Catherine Oxenberg, ""real""?  Can Lindsey and his disciples  honestly expect any rational, faithful Christian to believe that one human  being's entering a previously hidden portion of Hebrew scripture into a  computer could make the difference between global harmony and Satanic  rule?
Now, I'm perfectly willing to write off the scripural and  theological value of a film if it is decently entertaining and at least  thought-provoking.  (""Stigmata"" comes to mind.) But unfortunately  for ""The Omega Code,"" other than a smattering of cool (though  largely plot-irrelevant) special effects, I finished the movie with one  question: ""Why did I bother?""
You don't have to take my word  for it, but do yourself this favor: before buying ""The Omega  Code,"" rent a copy on DVD.

1342306,1,B00004REV2,"John's Apocalypse can be understood either as the nightmarish vision of a disturbed mind or else as a deeply symbolic religious diatribe. The idea of making a movie about the literal interpretation of the nightmare itself  could be very interesting from the cinematographic point of view, but,  certainly, can be on no value whatsoever to Christianity - it would in fact  trivialize the Scriptures.
This movie fails on all counts: As  entertainment it's badly done even though I actually sympathize with the  actors who were trying to do their best with an extremely stupid script and  mediocre directing. As a Christian movie, I think it is a disaster: it is a  thinly veiled attempt to scare people back to religion. It pushes people to  think about the surface rather than the content and meaning of the good  message. For example, in the movie the Salomon Temple is rebuilt  physically; any reader of the New Testament knows that the Temple  symbolizes Christ's body or faith in Christ. A basic idea in the movie is  that God not only chooses to speak to humanity through a book, but chooses  to put in it important information as a ""code"" decipherable by  computers! Superstition has nothing to do with Christianity and this movie  will not do any good no matter how many people call it  ""Christian"".

1342371,1,B00004REV2,"This film was dreadful in almost every regard.  The story concept was intriguing, but the writing was terrible and the presentation was butchered.  The basic premise was that the mysteries of prophesy for all of  human history were encoded into the bible.  A bible scholar breaks the code  and he is killed and the code stolen by Stone Alexander (Michael York) who  then uses it in his attempt to set himself up as king of the world.
The  direction in this film was awful.  Robert Macarelli was uniformly bad in  direction of the actors, the camera work, and the use of cheesy special  effects.  The film had the look and feel of a bad TV production.
But  Macarelli's paucity of talent in direction was greatly exceeded by the  abysmal acting.  No number of acting lessons will ever help Casper Van  Dien.  He was so plastic and forced in his presentation that I retched at  almost every line.  He needs to be modeling clothing in magazines or some  other endeavor where we don't have to hear him speak.
Michael York, who  is actually a good actor, seemed like he had caught whatever bad acting  virus Dien brought to the set, since his performance was also stiff and  overacted.  Michael Ironside gave his standard bad guy performance which  was probably the only decent acting in the film.
In a word this movie can  only be described as AARRRRRGH.  Avoid it like bubonic plague.  If you must  see it, be sure not to eat for at least five hours beforehand.  I rate it a  2/10 (and that is being kind).",956793600,,1502,4.51685393258427

I have no desire to unfairly bash this work yet I feel no urge or loyalty to praise it either.  Therefore, in  memory of Howard Cosell, I only want to  ""tell it like it is.""  The overarching fact I learned from this viewing is how a movie with real  potential can be utterly destroyed by unbelievably poor directing.  The  bright spots of the movie for me were Michaels York and Ironside, yet even  their talents could not overcome the handicap of the lamentable directing.  As for the ""acting"" of the ""star"" (Casper Van Dien),  all I can say is that Lee Majors and Chuck Norris now have fresh  competition as to who wears the crown of the most mono-dimensional and  painful-to-watch ""actor"".  In my opinion, the choice of a  different director and a different actor as ""hero"" could have  transformed this movie into something really special.  The potential is  obviously there, but Casper's acting and Marcarelli's directing just pull  the whole thing down like a gasping sailor tied to Titanic's anchor as she  slides inexorably into the cold and dark depths.  My REASONS TO WATCH THIS  MOVIE: 1) If you just want to watch a Christian film, regardless of  quality; 2) If you want to get some visual input as to the content of the  book of the Revelation; 3) If you want to view a movie without sex or  profanity; 4) If you like computers and want to see some interesting  special effects; 5) If you are loyal to TBN and want to do your part in  supporting their effort in making this; and 6) If you want to see a crystal  clear demonstration as to how poor directing is an obstacle too big for  even a good actor to overcome (York or Ironside).  My REASONS TO AVOID THIS  MOVIE: 1) If you need to maintain a feeling that your money was well spent;  2) If pathetic acting and even worse directing might cause you frustration  or anger; 3) If you expect to be entertained by it; and 4) If having your  intelligence insulted offends you.

For a low budget movie, I say they did a pretty good job. I did feel, however, that there  were some big weaknesses it though. The military power and influence of  Micheal York's character was not established enough for me. When he started  barking out for his Generals to act, I wondered who he was refering to. His  military influence was nowhere spelled out. And Casper Van Dien's Tony  Robins like character was a bit too much in the talk show sceens. I can't  believe he let the director make him jump around like he did. Other than  that, Van Dien is a pretty good actor to me. The Abomonation that makes  Desolate scene was the WORST!

If the producers make another film on  this or other topic and listen to some of the critique here, I believe that  a really good work that is widely accepted is possible.",956102400,5,1158,4.375586854460094
1342392,1,B00004REV2,One forgets to even look for a plot in this movie as it is so poorly acted and directed. The acting is wooden and what plot there is  lacks continuity and development. Wouldn't even suggest this for a rental.  Read the book,955929600,3,223,4.285714285714286
1342393,1,B00004REV2,"If I could have given this movie less than one star, I would have.  This movie promotes Equadistant Letter Sequencing which is heresy because it is saying God said something that he didn't say.  I would rather eat my own  liver with a rusty spoon than watch this movie again.  The only redeeming  quality of this movie is that (other than the ELS stuff) it follows the  book of Revelation fairly closely.  This movie should have a warning lable  on it saying ""Watching this movie could be hazardous to your  salvation.""",955670400,,519,4.615384615384615
1342394,5,B00004REV2,Yes it was poorly directed and a score like a movie that you would hear on the Simpsons tv. But it was very intelligent and had a message to deliver.

1342396,4,B00004REV2,"Having read the book, I asked myself whether watching the movie would be worthwhile. And, oh yes, it was! While not quite measuring up to Spielberg, it was quite refreshing having the story told in less Hollywoodian style.  The movie follows the book script strictly but this only emphasise the fact  that some books are better on screen.
Good directing, credible  story-telling and a wonderful couple of villains - Michael (York) and  Michael (Ironside) - carrying the film through. While York's slick face and  British accent makes him the likeable world saviour from the beginning, the  evil, ever-present smile of Michael Ironside portrays just the wonderful  sidekick that would love to mess things up. Perfectly played.

I missed it in the theaters, so when it came out on video, i watched it, and let me tell you, it's one of my favorites.  I'm  buying ASAP.  When i read the reviews, i was surpised to find that many  didn't like this.  When i read them, it seemed that most of the negative  comment were from non-Christians, and most of the positive comments were  from Christians.  Since i'm a Christian, I can't give a balanced view, or  attack the negative reviewers.  I just want to say that I personally don't  think that you have to be a Christian to appreciate this movie.  It does  help if you know about Revelation, but I just don't think that non-  Christians should not see it because of what it's about.  This movie has  stirred up alot of stuff, and it's interesting how the non-Christians have  opposed it so much.  But anyway, whoever you are, you need to see it.

Then  back to L.A. to take a job at some college. And, get this: he is being  chased by some bad guys in a car and he has to pull over to use his cell  phone to call his wife!

1342422,4,B00004REV2,"I do not suppor the Christian right, but there is no denying that the events portrayed in this film (based upon fundamentalist interpretations of Biblical prophets) make for an exciting and spectacular yarn. The  super-natural events are right in sync with the Opening-of-the-Ark scene in  Raiders of the Lost Ark, and no more far-fetched than the use of the Force  in Star Wars. The production quality was excellent, and the script and  acting acceptable for an action thriller. Why the negative reponse? I can  only guess that it is because the film makers were seeking to do more than  entertain and many people found this offensive. If you can set aside your  prejudices and judge the film only on its merits, this is clearly a  better-than-average suspense yarn. You don't have to agree with a film's  point of view to be able to enjoy it. Look at Oliver Stone's  ""JFK"" for example. The idea that the JFK assasination was  carefully executed by a coaltion of the CIA, Mafia, New Orleans gays, Cuban  patriots, and the Right-Wing Military/Industrial complex is so outrageous  that it is laughable, yet it makes for a compelling drama and entertaining  movie. If you watch Omega Code with the same spirit, you'll have a good  time. And wouldn't it be funny if we found out they were right? Maybe  Oliver Stone was right too.",954547200,8,1327,4.779735682819383
1342423,1,B00004REV2,"On what sounded like a good title The Omega Code it sure sounds good and hey there doing a movie about religion something that is rarely done in Hollywood these days. When this movie debuted it cracked the top 10 that  weekend at the box office with an impressive $ 2.4 million for a movie that  was only showing on roughly 300 screens and in 29 states scross the country  it became an indie hit it's budget for only $7 million. Believe me it shows  the low budget quality is clear. The second rate special effects and acting  made an intriging title made such a bad movie.
The Movie stars  ""Biblical Expert"" Casper Van Dien who thinks he knows how to  decode it working under the ultra hammy Micheal York who wants to take over  the world. This movie was void of suspense after the first five minutes.  Really jetisoned any religious pretense. It just goes with second rate f/x  and lame action sequences and such bad acting that would make any of the  worst movies of 1999 seem like a first rate piece of movie making. As  always Casper Van Dien overacts like it's the end of the world here.  Really truly this is one god awful mess. Strictly for the Bible belt crowd.  Not for mainstream audiences.",954460800,10,1201,4.424657534246576
1342424,3,B00004REV2,"even though i've seen much better Christian movies than this, i have to agree that considering the budget put in, its a pretty good movie. as long as it opens doors for more christian productions in future, its all worth  it! and direction wise, Matthew crouch is still learning, but like they  say, 'its not just a movie, its a miracle!' so if God's working on  this..everyone better buckle up..! you never know what would happen.",954374400,4,431,4.644736842105263
1342425,1,B00004REV2,"So that subtitle has already been taken.  It was still the primary theme of this movie, which was easily the worst I've seen since Very Bad Things.  Let me try to figure this out.  A businessman with all of the charisma of a  cut rate Infomercial host (played by Michael York) and his fallen-priest  assassin sidekick (Michael Ironside who always has roles like this, just  normally in better movies)get ahold of a special computer program that will  decipher the hidden prophetic messages in the Bible which they will then  use for fun & prophet.  I mean profit.  To help them interpret these  messages they inlist the aid of a fifth-rate self-help guru (Casper  Van-Dien).  Actually, this kind of makes sense.  There does seem to be  something insidious & evil about those infomercials.  Somehow or other  this group of people who couldn't sell a glass of water for $.05 to a man  dying of thirst with $50 in his pocket manage to create a one-world  government.  The self-help guru discovers that he has been a pawn &  that York & Ironside are out to take over the world & bring about  Armageddon, so he tries to stop them & becomes a fugitive. Michael York  & Michael Ironside are both usually very good actors.  How they ended  up involved in a movie like this is anyone's guess.  It is very heavy  handed, ludicrous & would fail to convert anyone who isn't already a  devout Christian.  In fact, it may cause some to become Agnostic or  Atheistic.  Rent Pi for a movie with a similar plot handeled more  efficiently.  And, if you want movies without profanity, Iron Giant,  Disney's Tarzan, Mighty Joe Young (the surprisingly good remake), The  Rocketeer, any of the Star Wars movies, most of the Star Treks  (they only  swear in IV & Generations & then only sparingly), the list goes on.  And when you watch these movies you won't feel like your intelligence has  been insulted, either.  If only the same could have been said for The Omega  Code.",954201600,6,1952,4.623529411764705

1342427,4,B00004REV2,"As I left the movie theater I kept thinking of all the people I wanted to see this movie. In a ""nutshell"" it is Satan versus God in a last days Revelation scenario. The producers put a twist on it with the Bible  code theme, but the central topic is clear. I believe that having knowledge  of the Bible and Revelation definately helps. It seems to tie in closely  with the ""Left Behind"" book series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry  Jenkins.  My only beef with the movie is that it went a bit too fast  and did not cover some important things in more detail. Of course it is  near impossible to cover seven years in 1 hour and 40 minutes. Perhaps two  episodes would have dealt with this problem.  Nevertheless, the  Spiritual warfare and the fact that Christ wins in the end make this movie  a must see, not only for Christians, but definately for non-Christians too.",954115200,8,859,4.3734177215189876

7920784,3,B00004REV2,"RELEASED IN 1999 and directed by Robert Marcarelli, ""The Omega Code"" is a biblical thriller about the end-times focusing on two men caught-up with the so-called Bible Code, hidden cryptograms within the ancient Torah that supposedly reveal global events of the past, present, and future.  One man (Michael York) seeks the power to control the world while another, a motivational speaker (Casper Van Dien), risks everything to find the truth. Michael Ironside plays the formers aide while Devon Odessa plays the latters wife in a troubled marriage. Catherine Oxenberg is on hand as a reporter.

This was a TBN production that cost $7.5 million in 1999 dollars (which means itd cost about twice that today). Most of the money was spent on the excellent locations (Israel, Italy & California), as well as the main cast and the CGI, which is cartoony but decent for 1999. The story is a meshing of ""Left Behind"" (2000) and ""The Apocalypse"" (2000) with a similar tone, but less effective in regards to story (of course, both of those movies came out the next year). Anyway, it helps if you're up on biblical prophecy, as detailed in Daniel and Revelation; if not, you'll likely be lost.

The movie starts good. Van Dien plays an interesting protagonist and you care about his family, but by the midway point I didn't find myself absorbed in the story despite the thrills (explosions, chases, etc.). Things perk up later, but the ending is decidedly forgettable. I cant even remember if the motivational speaker got back with his family (and I just viewed it last night). Somehow the human interest element got lost in the hubbub. Still, it is interesting observing a cinematic interpretation of biblical end-time prophecy, comic booky though it is. The main cast members are earnest and there are worthwhile moments here and there.

Just one question: WHERE is the Rapture ('cause it ain't in this movie)?

THE FILM RUNS 100 minutes and was shot in Jerusalem, Rome & the Los Angeles area (Costa Mesa). WRITERS: Stephan Blinn and Hollis Barton. ADDITIONAL CAST: Jan Trska & Gregory Wagrowski play the two prophets.
