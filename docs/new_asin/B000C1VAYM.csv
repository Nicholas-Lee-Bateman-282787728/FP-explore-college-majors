Yugo, a professional negotiator, is hired by a Russian expat in Japan to negotiate the release of a relative of his in Siberia.  His family was broken up during the Russian revolution because they were connected to the Tsar.  Of course, once Yugi arrives in Russia the plot thickens, and it turns out his client actually wanted to rescue his relative because she holds a ring that, when matched with one of his own, tells the location of a large sum of gold ""lost"" in the revolution.  Add the Russian intellignce sevice, who also wants the gold, several everyday Russians who want to help Yugi for various reasons, and the cold climate of Sibera, and the story arc becomes riveting.",1143158400,,783,4.611510791366906
