1085562,3,6305845336,"This movie is not totally irredeemable.  First off, I'd get rid of the custom designer, a four year old girl can dress her Ken and Barbies better than the dressers of this movie.  Along with the custom designer,I would also chuck the milliner and the screnwriter.  Most importantly, I would give Carrie Ng more to do than appear towards the end.  She is the only believable character and worth seeing.  Chingmy is  very pretty, but can get annoying but not as much as Simon Yam. I felt like jumping in the screen with a scissor and giving him a proper haircut, among other things.  And why get in the pool with body suits on?  If you didn't want your actors to be naked in the pool, then they should have been doing their stunts somewhere else, like the roof or on the fences.  These are the areas where creativity lacked and lagged.  I've always marveled at Hong Kong cinemas for their imaginative interpretations of what an action movie is suppose to be, but this on falls a little short.  I did like Wai Yui as granny Les Killer, but it got a little too disturbing when she started groping the junior assassin in training. Wai Yui is quit good in this movie though.  She gave the usual shoot out in the garage a new twist. Your money is not completely wasted, there are some high flying fight scenes, and some really funny moments, but laughable ones too.  I'd say, Rent it before you buy it.  Owning it means watching it a couple of times, shelving it away and when you get in a quirky mood, pop it in your DVD.",1073347200,,1515,4.364285714285714
1085563,1,6305845336,"This movie sucked.  It was a pointless film to start with, and the DVD just made it worse.  I would very strongly discourage anyone from buying or even viewing this horrid film.  Although this is only my opinion, if you are looking for a good action or thriller, I would suggest any of the ""Die Hard"" films.",1009929600,,307,4.350877192982456

Yea, I love Fellini, Polanski, Welles, Hitchcock...all the great directors....love their stuff. But for a film  that is just soooo damn sexy (the female cast is incredible, I wanted them  to kill me!) you can't go past this all out action thrill fest. No, it's  not deep, you don't get an understanding for the human condition, but you  get an understanding of how sexy an action flick can be.

1085568,3,6305845336,"This is certainly one of the more wild Hong Kong action films I've seen in awhile.  The action is cool, the women are sexy and the entertainment value is high.  A genre piece to be sure, but it works.  If you have any problems with women using their feminine wiles to get what they want, as well as a considerable amount of female-female violence, then you should probably run screaming from this film.

::Rating for this version of movie only::

NAKED KILLER itself is - well, you'll either love it or hate it for its completely gonzo storyline and production: A man-hating hitwoman has an affair with the screwed-up male cop hunting her, and is mentored by a Lesbian Hitwoman Of A Certain Age - while another Lesbian Hitwoman has a sick lust/hate relationship with the other two women culminating in just about everybody left alive BUT the poor male cop putting on rubber fetishgear while stalking and murdering each other in the most sexualized ways possible. It's more politically incorrect than the Tea Party - albeit a lot better looking, and more fun if you've got a sick sense of humor.

I bought this because it was billed as ""The Uncut Version"", with a running time of nine minutes longer than the other versions sold. I suspected it might be an overseas cut - what I didn't expect it that it's an overseas cut dubbed into English and NOT anamorphically enhanced, so that it just sits in a window in the middle of my HDTV screen! Image quality is, to be charitable, really poor - it looks like some online AVI copy burned to DVD.

I'm asking for my money back....",1348012800,5,1192,4.639810426540285
7897110,4,6305845336,"This movie falls in the genre of j-adventure, not enough blood for a splatter film and not enough nudity/sex for a pink film.  What you do have is an interesting story of a woman who becomes an assassin for the right reason and stops for love, unfortuately those involved don't want her to quit.  This movie was entertaining and well acted for the caliber of film it was.

7897115,4,6305845336,"1992 Hong Kong Erotic Thriller.  Rated R for strong sexuality, violence and language.  Caution: contains brief nudity (the opening credits), and the movie is very violent and bloody.  Something of a romance. Also known as Chiklo gouyeung and Chi luo gao yang.  The producer mentions a ""Naked Weapon,"" saying that it had been intended as a sequel, but ended up a different movie with different actors and director.

DVD Features: Along with the movie, which can be heard in English or Cantonese, or read in English or Chinese, the DVD contains special features and trailers.  There are seven trailers on the DVD (other than this film's trailers) and which include: Magnificent Warriors (rated R; war film, Japanese invade; stars Michelle Yeoh; trailer in English), City Hunter (PG-13; Jackie Chan film; other than humor and fighting, can't tell what the movie is about; trailer in English), Magnificent Butcher (PG-13; Sammo Hung; Action director: Yuen Woo Ping), Hong Kong 1941 (rated R; Chow Yung-Fat; Japan invades Hong Kong, resistance movie), Heart of Dragon (rated R; 30 yrs old, limited intelligence, ""great detective"" takes care of him; Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan), Kiss of the Dragon (rated R; Jet Li is a spy, also includes Bridget Fonda), and The Transporter (PG-13; in Euro-accented English).  The Special Features include: this film's Trailers (two, an original (which has scenes in it I don't recognize being in the movie) and a new trailer (which is in English and doesn't have scenes in it I don't recognize)), Photo Galleries (two, one for the film (even the photo gallery has pictures of a scene not in the movie, maybe its my DVD, cutting out that type of thing for me), and one for the ""beauties"" of Hong Kong (very long slide show set to music)), Interviews (3 separate interviews with the producer (who speaks in English), director (in English; mentions nude scenes, seriously, what's wrong with my DVD, why do I only see nudity in the opening credits?), and one of the stars: Simon Yam (in English)), Promotional Materials (posters and still photos) and Production Notes (synopsis, cast and crew notes).

Credits: Starring: Chingmy Yau (Kitty; ""Return to a Better Tomorrow""), Wai Yiu (Cindy; ""The Flower Floating on the Sea""), Simon Yam (Tinam/Tom; ""Once Upon A Time A Hero in China""; ""Tomb Raider 2""), Carrie Ng (Princess; ""Best of the Best""), and Madoka Sugawara (Baby).  Written by: Wong Jing (""Naked Weapon"") and Directed by: Clarence Fok Yiu Leung (""Century of the Dragon"").

Plot: Hong Kong Detective Tinman (also known as Tom) is investigating a series of murders in Hong Kong that he believes are related and committed by a female assassin (he notes his suspicions but they are initially not believed to be likely, namely because his brother has been killed, and the nature of the deaths).  Meanwhile, Tom has started a ""relationship"" with Kitty, a woman that is rather rough on the male population, and later revenges her father's death (which was pretty much an accident).  Due to her actions, Kitty is now on the run from the police and organized crime, but is helped by a hit woman named Cindy (who teaches her how to become a better killer, using any weapon on hand or using her body).  Cindy had another student before Kitty, and this student (Princess) and her female lover have targeted Cindy and Kitty for death.

Review: Interesting opening credits, and it certainly says something about the rest of the film that it includes nudity (though the fact that the first scene involves a naked hit woman taking out a man, but without anything ""good"" visible, also says something).  A rather professional looking movie, but the dubbing is not the best (though, oddly enough, unlike some Asian movies I've seen, the spoken words and the written words actually match, for the most part).  Though having the hit women twirl her loaded gun is strange and not professional looking.

A rather interesting and good movie, that is actually erotic, unlike many of the ""erotic thrillers"" out there.  Oh, and it also appears to be an overall better film than most ""erotic thrillers.""  On the other hand, there is a lot less nudity than I would expect (for the most part, none, the opening credits lie; maybe the US version of the film had the nudity edited out).

The movie has a connection with movies like ""House of Flying Daggers,"" and ""Romeo and Juliet,"" in that all three movies involve people who become romantically linked but work (or are otherwise members of) for different factions in a feud (here, criminal/police).

The plot is kind of rambling along, almost seeming to have little point.  The acting is difficult to determine due to the nature of the dubbing and my not speaking the language the film was originally filmed in.  Despite that handicap, I believe that the acting was good (every actor; I hadn't seen any of these actors before and I am interested in catching some more of their films).  Overall, I would rate the film 4.22 stars.",1118102400,7,4975,4.8882282996432815
7897116,5,6305845336,"I had a great time watching this movie on VHS. It's a movie I enjoy watching over & over again. If you like Asian action movies with girl-girl romance scenes, some violence with fancy moves, perverts getting their just reward & adult themes give this flick a look. I'd consider my collection of Asian action flicks incomplete without Naked Killer. If the characters were your neighbors life would never be dull.
