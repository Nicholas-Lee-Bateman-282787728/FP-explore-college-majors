7801986,5,1935944649,I have used and studied over 100 cd/tape/dvd courses of all types.  Jim Rohn's all are among the best of them.  Always 5 stars!,1435190400,,127,4.25
7801987,5,1935944649,"Jim Rohn is one of my favorites.  So eloquent, direct, and humorous.  Has a truly developed skill in leading.  Much wealth is contained in this Seminar.",1426291200,,152,4.769230769230769
7801988,5,1935944649,"Sometimes we need reminders about how we need to go about getting things done. Jim Rohn is the master at making things seem so obvious. Of course!!! You'll hear that many times, and think it as well. Enjoy every minute of this great series.",1401753600,,240,4.4772727272727275
7801989,3,1935944649,"Mr Rohn makes some terrific points and has good ideas but he is very ""old school"" in some of his approaches to, for example, leadership and even to a small degree, parenting. I am currently in my PhD studies for Organizational Leadership and his suggestions are absolutely not what is currently held as best practice. Mr Rohn is also, based on the lecture, a devout Creationist mentioning the Earths age as 6000 years old - lots of biblical parable embedded into the program. This is not necessarily a bad thing at all but it might be nice to know before you buy. Please note, I gave three stars due to old school content not because of the bible stuff.",1401494400,3,653,4.495798319327731
7801990,5,1935944649,"Interesting to discover that so many of our modern,well known self-help gurus appears to have gotten their inspiration from Jim! Worth every minute listening - and re-listening and re-listening.",1384473600,4,194,5.724137931034483
7801991,4,1935944649,I have only recently began to follow Mr. Rohn however his impact on my life has been dramatic already. This course helps you work on developing the critical stages in your life so that you can become successful. He uses humor and stories to ingrain the principles he learned over the years starting from the day he met Mr. Earl Shoaff.,1355788800,7,335,4.508196721311475
