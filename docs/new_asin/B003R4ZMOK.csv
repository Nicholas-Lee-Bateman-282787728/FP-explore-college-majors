4176584,5,B003R4ZMOK,"I've seen every episode so far and loved them all.  I even watched 3 of them twice while waiting for the 4th to come out.  If you have ever seen his stand-up and liked it then buying this show is a no brainer, you will laugh constantly.  He has really honed his craft and become one of the greatest comedians of our time and this show is a great mix of little bits of standup and a fictional (I hope anyways) version of his life in short story segments.  A very unique format I haven't seen before quite like this.  The humor is dirty, dark and silly at times while remaining smart but unpretentious.  Really a treat, I hope the network gives it a fair shot and they get a strong audience so we can enjoy more of this show.

in short, watch this show and check out his standup if you get a chance.  You will be so glad you did.",1279324800,3,827,4.061728395061729

Love the writing and the fact that this stars alot of hilarious, underrated comedians.
Hopefully people will try and give the show a chance; we need more brutally honest, funny television these days. The show is more real than any ""reality"" television on right now. Spend two bucks and enjoy yourself, you won't be disappointed.",1278806400,,404,4.785714285714286

4176849,5,B003R4ZMOK,"This excellent TV show got a Peabody Award in 2012. I am writing this about ALL of the seasons of ""Louie"".
This is the sitcom you watch after Seinfeld because after Seinfeld people would wonder what could be better than Seinfeld?  Seinfeld was such a long time ago that its humor is dated now. Very 90s.
Although I did notice that CK borrowed some material from Seinfeld and just ran with it and turned it into strictly-adults-only humor for his ""Louie"".
""Louie"" is a sophisticated mix of humor and drama. Sometimes the show can be surreal and then not surreal at the same time because stuff like what CK puts on his show really happens, esp. in this country now. Example from ""Louie"": When Louie travels to Oklahoma. You have to see that episode and all of the episodes to see what I mean. So don't be offended. CK's humor can often be very surreal and still very funny.
The music used for this series is the best I have ever heard and it fits the down-emotions vibe of this excellent show.
However, after watching all of the episodes, CK screwed up by dropping the Jazz/Blues that he used on the first 3 seasons. That was great music. After that, it seemed like they were experimenting with other music and it did not work. The show was still good though.
The ""cinematography"", if it's still called that in the digital age, is the best ever for a sitcom. Great camera angles used to set the scenes.
The early seasons of this series are too heavy on homophobic rants in CK's attempt at humor with that, I did notice that he cut back a lot on that in the following seasons.
Great comedy/drama series. Is that a first? Well written and highly entertaining.
Why ""Louie"" never got an Emmy is unfathomable.",1468454400,,1702,4.490322580645161

But what makes this eerie are the stand up scenes. Louie describes heartbreaking scenes and does so with a smile on his face. And people in the audience laugh hysterically. It's almost as if that's how Louie contrives his material; he comes up with things that make him want to cry and then he tries to make people laugh at it. It's kind of sick.

It's a mix of stand up routines and short sketch bits. In the sketches, the other actors are often other stand up comics who have the same sense of humor as Louie CK. I assume they are all comics Louie knows personally from comedy clubs. So there is acting chemistry between everyone. This just makes everything flow better and be funnier.

It comes down to how much you like Louie CK. If you hate his stand up, you will probably hate this show. If you like his stand up, you'll like this show because it's the exact same style of humor you're used you from Louie CK.",1464480000,,744,4.307142857142857

I guess that's the reason his show is so good.  He's talking about his life and the world he lives in. The same world most of us live in. He's the best comic on the scene, that's a fact.

One thing, Lou--when you're doing your bit in the Cellar, do you always use the same 3 guys at the table sitting stage right? It's distracting. It's sloppy. If they aren't the same 3 guys, then they're awful close to the same. Put a woman or 2 there, or do something to really switch it up. Nitpicking? Maybe, but it's distracting.

You're the best in the business, Louie CK. But you've earned it. I remember 25 years ago, you doing a bit on Conan with Robert Smeagel (?), about how to communicate with your dog. Haha. You had all your hair still. Thanks, right?",1451433600,,906,4.1657142857142855

4177356,5,B003R4ZMOK,"Seinfeld revolved around a stand-up comedian constantly sabotaged by the catastrophic social faux pas of himself and the people inextricably involved in his life, intercut with performance sets by the actual comic. So is Louie. But where Seinfeld was purportedly ""a show about nothing,"" Louie is a show in which from moment to moment, you can safely expect nothing. Not only does Louis C.K. straddle the gaps in social protocol and everyday confrontations we all understand, but also the extremes of comedy and tragedy. It's a gallows comedy, in which we can find ourselves laughing in elation at the both wry and surreal absurdity of one moment, then clenching our chair arms in both tension and incredulity at moments of agonizing pain and even at times a true sense of impending brutality.

There is no continuity from one episode to the next, or even from one vignette to the next. Each episode is comprised of usually two scenarios book-ended by stand-up sets by Louie, which may or may not turn out to be part of one of the scenes. It's the direct inversion by an observant everyman's misanthrope of the TV sitcom. Whereas every sitcom we've ever seen has one essential soundstage, an ongoing play-like farce that runs before two cameras, all the same characters show up and everything not only works out but is just the same as before by the end, each week Louie will give a stream of consciousness an unsystematic narrative silhouette almost invariably a sequence of encounters with characters who enter and exit, yet very few ever return. Some actors and actresses return in different roles. Louie's mother is at one point played by an old woman as an appalling malignant narcissist and in another episode a humble, warm-hearted young working-class woman.

The show is written, directed and edited by its star, and he creates a visually realistic look and atmosphere for his small stories, captured quite cinematically. In the God episode, arguably the boldest, most powerful episode, he injects solemn amber tones, almost I dare say comparable to Gordon Willis' work on the Godfather films. There is a considerable proliferation of long takes in which two characters will share dialogue that sounds and feels no less real than that which we'll share with someone tomorrow. Sometimes, he's bold enough to prolong a single, stationary take in which nothing is being said on-camera, but all the action that affects the character in the shot is occurring off-camera, and in that very single take, we're carried seamlessly and steadily from deadpan absurdity to genuine terror. Then comes the cut: Life goes on; nothing's really that big of a deal. Simply put, each week, C.K. delivers one or two of the most powerful and memorable short films you may ever see.",1441584000,,2766,4.959051724137931

4177672,4,B003R4ZMOK,"I'm torn on this one. Louie seems torn too. On the one hand, he wants to think he's a ""good"" person, but then he seems to really spend a lot of his show justifying his behavior; which seems to indicate he doesn't truly think he is.  I know he's a comedian and this is meant to be funny, and some of it genuinely is, but I really have to say that I hurt for him as I watch this show. I can't stop watching it, so I guess that's good from a review standpoint, but it's almost painful to see how he struggles to work through the issues with which he deals.

One thing that seems to be a recurrent theme is that Louie is only saying what we're all really thinking. If you said to him that you never wanted to kill your children, I get the sense that he'd accuse you of lying. We're all sinful, and we all have the capacity to have such feelings, but I think the religious struggle depicted here (he spends a lot of time on this subject BTW) shows that he was just thrown under the bus by his unbelieving mother, which really had an impact on him. After that, he spent a lot of time trying to reconcile his Christian education with his mother's mis-teachings.  Of course we all love our mothers and we look up to them, so how do we reconcile what they ""teach"" us and what is taught by the church.

As a Christian, I really do live in the world and pay attention to what's going on here.  I like to observe and interact with unbelivers so that I can better understand them.  I pray for LouieCK and everyone like him. I really do understand him better now.  I had turned off his comedy show one time because it was so very offensive and hard to watch, but after watching season 1 of this show, I understand him better now. I really think God could use someone as smart and funny as Louie. It would be nice to have him on our side.",1434499200,,1823,4.103932584269663

4177764,5,B003R4ZMOK,"Louie C.K. is a genius, there are no two ways about it. Years ago I watched what I think was his original HBO series (where he lived in an apartment with one young daughter), but this new series if far superior. (I don't get HBO on cable any more, so I'm watching these in Amazon Prime, which I love.) In this series Louie is divorced, shares custody of two daughters with his wife and much of the show takes place on stage during stand up.

But much of each episode is also a very sophisticated and interesting adult sitcom. It's obvious that his humor is completely autobiographical (whose isn't?), but he manages also to tie in universal themes: unrequited love, family stress, crappy career choices, etc.  There are a few episodes in later seasons that are a bit on the gross side (and I've been a radio comedian for 25 years, I have a high tolerance for grossness--really high) and a few episodes actually hit me the wrong way with grossness, but this first season is quite gentle comparatively. Really funny and extremely inventive, but more gentle.

Louie is probably the funniest man alive right now and he writes and directs the episodes, so he's obviously very controlling and a perfectionist (gee, let's see...writes, directs, stars in...yeah, I guess that is controlling). I go to bed with Louie almost every night, and in terms of the dreams I have, it certainly beats going to sleep with the Sopranos, which I was doing for the past several months.",1433030400,,1462,4.680933852140078

So far I have watched the first disc of season 1.  This is what I would call ""uncomfortable comedy"" or ""Seinfeld: The Next Generation.""  (I made those up just now, but wouldn't be surprised if someone else beat me to it).  You definitely can't watch this show with kids in the room.  Sex jokes and dirty words.  But it's generally funny and makes me laugh.  And again, sometimes the jokes (or situations) can be a bit uncomfortable.  I also like how things are often unresolved at the end of the episodes.

I love all the New York city scenes; they are one of the most fun parts of the show...getting to trek around the neighborhoods with Louie and observe all his wonderful nuances and eccentricities. I also love the opening credits as he walks down the city streets as nightlife unfolds and he dashes into a pizzeria for a slice of pizza before he heads out to the comedy club to do his set.

I think Louie is very beautiful; his skin, his teeth, his eyes, his physique...it's amazing to me how much he gets on himself about not being attractive or not having a killer body...because to me, he is a regular guy and infinitely appealing. Perhaps it's his personality that melds so well with his looks and in totality makes him so massively enjoyable as a human being. He's warm, real, funny, touching, endearing, insightful and delightful. I love the show and it's such a great escape for myself to turn to Amazon and its great line-up of shows, snuggle safely in my warm bed with tons of winter comforters and blankets, my dogs at my side, and an icy cold bottle of Budweiser Black Crown to sip on while I laugh with everything Louie has to offer.",1416700800,,1266,4.410256410256411

Louie is obviously very intelligent and clever, and I found the sketches (taking kids on an outing with a difficult school bus driver; an awkward first date) very funny.  But the stand-up portion of the show delved into several topics that I didn't think were funny at all, and actually somewhat disturbing (people dying from hunger because he bought an expensive car; taking his dog to be euthanized and talking about piles of dead dogs as though that were hilarious).

We are usually fairly in tune with our likes and dislike along these lines, but I had to disagree.  I found it to be a just a rehash of Seinfeld but without the supporting cast.  I could not stand Jerry, but the crew around him made the show work ... although I did not see a single episode until it was re-released.

Louis is a divorced man with two young daughters who spend some time with him.  Even when he's wearing his ""daddy hat"" there are a lot of asides and innuendo taking place out of the girl's purview. At night he does his stand up routine which can be raunchy and at times over-the-line of what's acceptable. He tackles all subjects; from sex to Osama bin Laden with the same cheekiness.

At just 20-somthing minutes per episode, these fly right by, because they're so funny. I'm very much looking forward to watching the other seasons!

The episode that did that for me was from season 4, not season 1. It's called ""So did the Fat Lady"".

Here's the thing though, I went back and started from Season 1, and the brilliance is there from the start. The range of talents that Louis CK demonstrates in these shows is downright prodigal. He writes them, directs them, acts in them, even edits them, and it's all done with masterly skill.

He's a famous comedian, the show takes that for granted, so his lifestyle and activities are pretty alien to me, and probably to you too, but the truth of the human interactions in the show cuts right through those differences and illuminates my world in unexpected and moving ways.

The show isn't really a comedy (though there are some very funny moments) except in the sense that all of human life is a comedy. If your taste runs heavily to Michael Bay or Judd Apatow movies, it might not be for you, but if you've ever enjoyed a movie written by Charlie Kaufman, or directed by Franois Truffaut, or, if you're just open to having your assumptions take a beating, I recommend Louie without reservation.",1403913600,2,1517,4.569852941176471

The first disc was okay, but the second one refused to play, I tried on three different players (a regular Blu-ray player, a ps3 and a ps4) on both my PS consoles, it would make them freeze to the point that I had to unplug them and they just kept reading the disc without success.

I prefer to watch shows that have a beginning and then an end. This first episode was actually 4 or 5 snippets (jokes/routines) that did not have an overall theme.

It is Lenny Bruce meets Seinfeld. I expected actual topical and intelligent non-scatalogical or vulgarity laced humor, not cellar club smut presented as entertainment.

Sometimes, he makes me laugh. I get a little tired of all the self-loathing sex talk. It can get a little tedious. I don't really care for most of the female characters.  Having said this, I really enjoyed his portrayal of parenthood and of all the negative feelings that caretaking brings up and uncomfortable situations that confront him like other people's strange children.  The 2 young actors who play his daughters are wonderful.  I loved seeing how people lived in NYC and the backstage look at a comedy club.

The show itself features a number of guests who are mostly if not all friends of Louis C.K. and the show benefits from this, even though some of them play different people it lends an air of familiarity and trust to the performances on the show. It's also obviously extremely funny in a very dark way, so those that are faint of heart should probably avoid this show.

I imagine if you like LCK's standup, you probably would enjoy it but for me I was never a big fan and this shows change in tone during the second season reminded me exactly why.  For me, LCK humor is just a series of one uncomfortable self-exposure/TMI that seems to have the sole goal of reveling a very pathetic, self involved male who seems obsessed with aging, body functions and is generally upset he doesn't rate better quality sexual partners.  In short, he's a loser in a very creepy way and it bleeds through the screen...then you have all these other unlikable characters like his bratty spoiled daughters, one complete with an adorable speech impediment along the lines of Elmer Fudd, his disgusting sister who howls and screams nonstop due to gas, his bit*chy neice and other sister....life is too short to waste time on this stuff.",1397174400,,1005,4.661016949152542

I went into this show a bit hesistantly.  How would C.K.'s style translate into a television show?  Especially a television show on FX (without the no-holds-barred, no-censorship of a channel like HBO?)  The answer is FANTASTICALLY!!!

It's not just a comedy.  You'll be pleasantly surprised by how much genuinely solid writing is present everywhere in the show.  You'll frequently forget it's a scripted TV show, as it takes the form of a nigh-documentary quite often.  Special standout episode is episode 6, where he deals with a female heckler / over-talker in arguably the most hilarious fashion ever conceived by man.

The show is quite over the line, and it's not the top of thing you'll want to sit down and watch with your parents, but it's utterly fantastic from start to finish.",1395705600,,945,4.783950617283951

That said, I started watching his Louie television series and couldn't even get past the first 20 minutes on either occasion when I watched it.  I confess that I'm not a big fan of most of the so-called sit-coms on television in the first place. Louie did absolutely nothing to change my mind.  In the past, I really liked a few programs such as Cheers, Seinfeld and All In The Family, but that's about it.  I am almost tempted to give Louie two stars instead of three, since any time I find myself so thoroughly unimpressed with what's taking place onscreen that I simply have to turn it off, then it is hard for me to justify saying it's even ""okay"".  However, I should have probably tried to at least stick it out through the end of the episode to properly evaluate and rate it.  So, again because I like Louis C.K., I am willing to at least give it the benefit of the doubt and let it have those three stars.  Again, I really did try to watch that first Louie episode on two different occasions, but I just couldn't sit through it all the way without wanting to turn it off out of sheer boredom.  Maybe I'll force myself to give it yet one more go in the future and stick it out to the end before rendering judgement (which is probably what I should have done before writing this review).

Great commentaries and extras but mainly just bought it for the great episodes (especially the dog pound!)

Only downside to the purchase is the rather flimsy Blu-ray Case which is not fully covered nor hard plastic, would swap it out with anotehr one buts its double disc so cant really (as don't have many double disk boxes). Also the double sided disc, i.e. blueray/dvd is redundant for me but had to buy this version as it seems to be the only one with all teh commentaries/extras.

4178886,5,B003R4ZMOK,"Best known for being the brains behind numerous late night talk shows and as an outlandish stand-up comedian, Louis C.K. and FX's ""Louie"" ventures into the ""Fictionalized, but still partially true"" (think David Byrne's ""True Stories"") world of the comedian's everyday experiences. Turning it into a more realized attempt at Seinfeld's ""a show about nothing"" tagline (i.e. Slice Of Life). It's really hard to nail down what makes this show so perfect, but Louie's genuine likeability as a fat, balding underdog of a stand-up performer has something to do with it I'm sure. You want him succeed, but at the same time, you also want him to fail miserably.

The show is intertwined with transitions between Louie's stand up act and poignant vignettes that are at times both humorous and melancholy. One of my favorites is the season 3 two-parter, ""Daddy's Girlfriend"", where Louie's daughters encourage him to get back on the ""dating horse"". He later bumps into an book store clerk named Liz (played by Parker Posey) and falls madly in love with her. But as they venture out into the neon playground of late night New York, Louie realizes how much of a broken human being Liz is, regardless of how perfect she appears to be.

Another aspect that I really do enjoy is the use of classic blues, jazz, and R&B from the 40's-60's as the show's background music. It adds an entirely new dimension to the vignettes that I feel deserves to be celebrated in every possible respect considering that shows these days are so concerned with using the latest hits to appeal to a younger, savvier audience.

In short, I can not say enough good things about this show. It is truly one the best comedy programs that I've seen in quite some time and has something for everyone to enjoy, even if you don't particularly like Louis C.K.'s raunchy stand-up",1377129600,,1831,4.787974683544304

4178912,4,B003R4ZMOK,"This is only a review of the first episode, but I've watched the rest of Season 1 since writing it and it only gets better.

Louis C.K. has become one of my favorite still-living comedians in recent years. The degree to which I identify with his self-deprecation and generally dark sense of humor is staggering. Sometimes I feel as though I'm getting a glimpse of a future version of myself, only older, balder, more miserable, and divorced, but somehow finding a way to keep myself and others laughing about it.

So, when I learned he created a television show in 2010, it should have been something I jumped onto from the start. But, for various reasons, I have only just started watching, even though I am very familiar with the show's style, tone, and background.

The concept alone makes Louie sound incredibly similar to Seinfeld, one of my favorite shows of all time. Essentially, the formula for the ""Pilot"" episode shows Louie doing stand-up at a local comedy club where he discusses everything from his kids to dating after divorce. The show then transitions to a more traditional, single-camera set-up that shows vignettes of Louie's life that are usually related to the bits he performs on-stage.

Again, it sounds incredibly similar to Seinfeld, but it's in the details that you realize the two shows couldn't be more different.

Besides the obvious lack of multiple cameras and a studio audience, Louie's tone is incredibly surreal. One of the most stand-out moments involves the reaction of Louie's date when he leans in for a kiss. I won't spoil anything, but it's a reaction you won't see in any other live action sitcom.

The sequence involving Louie's date showcases the aspect of the episode I both enjoyed and hated all at once. In short, the date is incredibly awkward. Painfully so at times. I can't handle embarrassment or awkward situations very well in my own life, but watching someone else suffer through it? Simply excruciating. And, of course, that's exactly what I had to sit through as Louie attempted to impress a young, beautiful woman.

That's not to say it wasn't funny. The date was hysterical. It's just that I was cringing as much I was laughing during that particular sequence.

Perhaps the aspect of the show I was most disappointed with  was the scenes of Louie doing stand-up. I found many of the bits incredibly lacking compared to material I've heard him do in the past, which usually leaves me with a beet-red face and no air in my lungs.

The exception to this, however, is when he talks about the death of a childhood dog. This piece of material exemplified everything I love about Louis C.K. His ability to recount the experience of losing a pet, perfectly capturing the pain and sadness that goes along with a story like that, and make it one of the funniest parts of the episode is simply incredible. So while I found the stand-up bits as a whole lacking, but still incredibly funny compared to his other work, the story of his dog dying is enough to forgive the rest.

Usually, when it comes to shows created by and starring comedians, the acting ability of that comedian can often be the weakest element in an otherwise solid production. In the case of Seinfeld, Jerry was never much of an actor, but, as the show went on, they were able to adapt Jerry's character to work in a way that Jerry, the actor and comedian, could play convincingly. It doesn't seem like this will be an issue for Louis C.K., as he displays a natural, if at times uneven, performance.

Overall, the ""Pilot"" episode of Louie makes for a promising start to what has become a critically-acclaimed series. My interest has certainly been piqued and I'm looking forward to more.",1359504000,,3701,4.729813664596273

4178918,5,B003R4ZMOK,"The first season of Louie IMO will go down in history as one of the best TV sitcom show seasons in TV history. I did not expect the profound depth from a sitcom comedy show. Sure you expect some funny jokes (since Louis CK really is a skilled and talented comedian as many of us already know) but his outlooks on life and the scenarios sketched display a kind of humanity and character that puts contemporary TV to shame. This may sound pretentious but I assure you that the careful viewer will see it in the show but Louie is remarkably good at showing the sublime in the everyday. The most touching shows I've seen are in season one.

For example, one episode has Louie on a date with a woman he clearly is smitten with. When they are having a coffee at a local joint they unfortunately are seated next to some obnoxious high school jocks and they relentlessly bully, humiliate and intimidate Louis in front of his date. The scene is so skillfully written and directed (both by Louis CK himself) you can't help but feel all the emotions of anger, fear, helplessness, disappointment, humiliation someone in that position must feel. Louie's date looses her attraction for him at the pitiful sight of him not ""standing up"" for himself despite the fact that he showed remarkable poise and courage in not responding to the bullying by sinking to their level. Again, one is magnetically drawn to identify with Louie's unfortunately predicament. Later Louie is so understandably angered and upset he follows one of his tormentors home and has a talk with his parents. We then learn from that exchange that the bully obviously comes from an abusive home and then we identify with the bully in turn. So this one show shows the profound nuances of life and I think any decent person can identify with Louie's moral tribulations in these scenarios. What's amazing is that Louis CK shows all this profound depth while still displaying the absurdity and humor in life too! What more do you want from a show? Other episode are just as memorable such as the flashback episode of Louie's loss of faith as a child and his touching interactions with his mother.

I've seen the other seasons of Louie as well. While still very good, they don't approach this first season's profundity and heart which as I've said, I think makes it a classic. What is amazing is that Louis CK was the sole writer, director producer and editor of this show and managed to make it on a spartan budget and using home editing software. Life is hard but Louie shows that there is also humanity and humor in it as well. See this unpretentious but at the same time deep and funny show for yourself.",1356998400,,2656,4.60126582278481

It is a safe show and there is nothing that can be earned from it but then where my complaint lies about this show is exactly what I like about this show to keep me bringing back. I am always curious about Louie, it will not be wrong to say the show is a spin off on a lot of people in New York. This brings me to my take on this show, I think it's a very HONEST show, I think the show never tries to show a life that cannot be lived or believed in.

It is tempting therefore to instantly compare Louie C.K. to both comics and his show to theirs.  And, above all, to compare all three to the early Woody Allen, who carved out his early career in tv, standup and comic movies.

The hugest difference right off the bat is that Louie is NOT JEWISH. If you are fans of the other three, this is a HUGE difference because the other three derive a lot of their comedy from being part of the Jewish American culture set in New York City.  Louie also is a single father with joint custody who takes care of his two daughters half of every week in a very hands on way.  No one can picture the other three doing anything of the sort.

Yet there is still a striking similarity and I think it is to do with all of them train a macroscopic lens on their personal lives with their comedy. No detail of making it through the day intact is left uncovered by any of them. Another similarity is that they are all disasters with women in their comedic personas.

If you are a fan of Jerry and Larry, you need to immerse yourself in several episodes of Louie to quiet your tendency to expect it to be SEINFELD or CURB.  By about the third or fourth episode, you are totally into Louie C.K. and are no longer comparing him to Jerry and Larry.  I loved the comic stylings of Louie C.K. and his examination of his world.

It's structured sort of like Seinfeld, about a 40ish guy who is a comic and also living his life. There the resemblance ends. Louie is an overweight, divorced guy with joint custody of his two little girls. He travels and does his show, which is so reminiscent of George Carlin I didn't know whether to laugh and celebrate Louie or cry because George Carlin is no longer with us.

4178950,5,B003R4ZMOK,"I didn't know much about Louie C.K. before watching this, but I had a vague impression that he was a buffoon.  I was listening to an interview he did with NPR, and it was interesting enough to get me to take a look for myself.

I was wrong about Louie.  He is not a buffoon (at least, his character on the show isn't).  This show is depressing and hilarious all at the same time.  I haven't ever seen another show like this - where normal life is portrayed and the depressing is funny and the funny is hilarious.  My favorite thing about this show is that the character is really trying to raise his kids right - you can see that when he tells them they have nothing to complain about, and that they can ask their Aunt why she is racist.

And this character is so sweet - the earnestness and sweetness that he has pull at your heart.  It's as if he's the only sane one in the world, and he's standing there watching the world go by, confused and not understanding why people are jerks and idiots.

I don't know - I'm usually good with words - but I don't have the words for this.  It's a great show.  Watch the pilot and another episode before you make up your mind (the pilot is not my favorite).",1346025600,,1197,4.160869565217391
4178951,2,B003R4ZMOK,"I was enjoying this show for the first five episodes. I thought Louis was a generally funny guy who was doing a good job satirizing our society in a way that made me laugh. Then, Louis did what too many comedians do - he took the easy route. He decided that the right way to put down a female heckler was to call her a c*** and suggest that a male audience member should put his d*** in her face. Really?? That's not edgy. That's the kind of sh** women have to deal with every day. Not only is he suggesting that calling a woman a c*** and threatening her with sexual assault is the right way to put her in her place, but he's also resorting to lazy, unoriginal comedy.  Would Louis really want some dude calling his daughter a c*** or threatening her with sexual assault, like he did to that young woman? It seems that Louis has trouble grasping the difference between satire (eg, a rape joke that makes fun of the rapist or of our sexist society) and sexism. I hope that his audience starts holding him accountable for improving his comedy.",1344729600,6,1042,4.316326530612245
4178952,5,B003R4ZMOK,"I was under the impression that TV comedy had died years ago and a half-wit warlock  resurrected it, lumbering and Zombie-like, as ADHD crap like ""Family Guy"" and ""Robot Chicken"" or cookie-cutter detritus like ""Two and half Men"" and ""How I Met Your Mother.""  You know, where you get the impression that the people making the show are laughing more than the people watching it . . . and the former is not really laughing all that much either.  ""Louie"" is the zombie apocalypse survivor who makes it through the night, pushes open the storm cellar door, and emerges with a shotgun, justifiably ready to blow the heads off whatever is still dumb enough to be staggering around.  It's written, directed, and headlined by Louis C.K., who looks more like the guy who rents you a U-Haul than a stand-up comedian, but that's perfect.  He is the master of timing, especially the slow burn, generally playing straight man in a world that makes little sense and therefore is a lot like ours, flashing a lightning-fast wit just often enough to remind you, thank God, somebody else out there gets it.  The show takes a page from ""Seinfeld"" -- and that's a supreme compliment -- in its jokes and set ups, commenting on the minutiae of daily life, relationships, self esteem, responsibility, and so forth, even though its aesthetic is more mopey than jokey.  Think ""Seinfeld"" on Xanax and with much more pathos, ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" without the smarm.  Louis C.K. plays a modern everyman, a divorced 40-something trying to figure out just what the heck happened while a confusing world swirls around him with more intent than purpose.  It has the guts to ask the questions people really have and to not always give them the answers they want, albeit with laughs.  A standout episode, for instance, features the ever date-hungry Louie finally coaxing a woman out, then convincing her to stay out a little longer at a donut shop, only to have the night ruined by a group of dumbass teenagers who turn Louie's badly conceived effort to be the grown-up in the room into an exercise in emasculation.  It's painful to watch, but it's the metaphor for Louie's life as a flawed man struggling to do what's right even when he isn't sure what that is.  When his date takes the gesture as a personal humiliation for her -- she understands why Louie does it but nonetheless feels he's a loser and ends the date -- we're reminded of why Louie is the conscience-addled square peg in a world of narcissistic round a-holes.  Believe it or not, there are some laughs in there, but how the episode resolves itself, especially when Louie follows one of the teenagers home and we're not sure what he or the punk's parents are going to do, is the essence of a good The New Yorker story.  ""Edgy"" is an overused word, and almost always misapplied, but ""Louie"" is edgy in its authenticity and more like listening to real people tell you their problems while chuckling over a beer.  The show has a Gen-Xer's sarcasm, but a better description would be say that it's ""adult,"" so that when we see Louie struggle through an awkward first date or suffer the travails of modern air travel, it's less about the gags and more about the truth people face in their lives.  Observations are grounded in reality rather than silliness, and that makes them all the more funny.",1342137600,,3324,4.675814751286449
4178953,5,B003R4ZMOK,"I'd never heard Louis C.K.'s comedy before watching S1, but knew, through various media channels that it was a more acidic type of dark comedy, which can, like any good sarcasm or cynicism, come out of the gate strongly, but ultimately wear out its welcome, as it can fall into cliche with its social commentary on things we all can relate to, and that kinda bum us out.

Not so with Louie.  Sure, he's got his ascerbic moments, and they are damn funny, but there is a ""realness"" to the season that evolves from about episode two until the season finale. I won't spoil anything for anyone, but the humorous aspects of the middle-aged, out of shape, single parent comic are flipped to reveal the darker underside of that life. That is the reality of living, the duality of living, that Louis C.K. Exposes so slowly that it definitely evokes a much different emotional response than laughter. The fact a comedy show attempts such depth is intriguing, and I am interested to see where the show takes us from here.

Bottom line - there is something to appeal to everyone, and certainly something to offend everyone, but I can't imagine many who, approaching Louie with a receptive attitude, will walk away unsatisfied. Fantastic, (r)evolutionary show.",1340841600,,1247,4.790697674418604

4178963,5,B003R4ZMOK,"This is Louie C.K.'s anti-sitcom, a work of pure inspiration and creativity, that refuses to pander to the bulk of television watching nit-wits who turn on the boob tube to be spoon fed punchline after punchline.  Funny is only a fraction of the equation, as the bulk of the show is mainly focused on realism, existentialism, (who am I, why am I here, what is the meaning of this?) and the crushingly hum-drum grind of everyday life.  Louie's struggles with being a divorcee', familial strife, his own degrading health, and his inability to connect with other people provide moments of transcendent television, that go so far beyond a comedy series, it is almost unfair to pigeonhole it as such.  There are definite moments of hilarity, and each episode features a small stand-up segment that usually offers the most laughs, but some episodes are funny in their subject matter alone: a doctor (Ricky Gervais) who is a little too close with Louie for comfort; Louie being told as an eight year old how to pleasure a woman, by his father; and a dentist who uses knock out gas as more than an anaesthetic.  Where ""Louie"" as a series really shines, is in it's depiction of the maddeningly mediocre. The real world that you and I live in as seen through the eyes of a sweet, funny man may not sound that interesting, but any true fan of the show knows that these are the moments of pure gold and the reason this series is so endearing.  I don't want this to become another ""Arrested Development"", where a brilliant series only lasts three seasons because the I.Q. of T.V. watchers has plunged further than the stock market!  Watch this, you'll either get it or you won't, and if you don't there's plenty of other shows out there for you, but if you do, there's only one show as true, honest, heartfelt, and hilarious as Louie.

4178967,4,B003R4ZMOK,"Louie Season 1 is comedy spliced with some thought provoking moments and general insight into a comedians life, be it heightened dramatically for more comic effect.
Now the season itself is great, but the Blu-Ray/DVD combo release is a great idea but can fall short on some fronts.
I have to admit one big issue being you can get fingermarks on the discs which isn't such a big deal, but some temperamental players will then struggle or not play the disc.

The other issue is that this is a release to the public so carries an adult rating, so why does it still have censored swearing and censored remarks? I'm all too aware that on American t.v. this is normal procedure, but really a DVD release needing the same treatment?
I'm not bringing this up as i want to sound like the swearing is a big deal or i need this to enjoy the Season, but if its going to be ultimately censored even when it comes to release to DVD and Blu Ray you might as well consider cutting those scenes as the viewer is not getting the material as it was intended to be delivered.

Great Season, DVD/Blu Ray Combo is a decent idea which could well be utilized better in future.

For a show originally shot in HD, I'm really confused about how the transfer to Blu-Ray could be so disappointing. The video quality on these episodes is very uneven, particularly for very dark scenes. Considering how great this show looked in HD during its original broadcast, it's a shame that certain sequences on the Blu-Ray are washed out. I'm guessing this is due to the compression needed to mash the episodes down onto two Blu-Ray/DVD hybrid discs. Whatever the cause, it might be better to stick with the original DVD release and not go with the DVD/Blu-Ray combo version, or just go with digital streaming.

Considering how much time and effort creator Louis CK put into a show that looks as good as this one does, it's  a real shame that the studio dropped the ball in transferring the series to Blu-Ray.",1312329600,23,1009,4.6892655367231635

It has to be said though that the discs are truly awful.  Blu-Ray on one side and DVD on the other is a guarantee that whatever format you prefer, you've just paid more for the side you're not going to use.  Not only that, but people have reported they don't play properly in Blu-Ray players.  In my experience, both discs skipped a lot (one episode wouldn't play at all) in two separate DVD players of mine.

I'm sending my copy back for an exchange, hopefully they'll change it to separate formats.

Update:  Amazon replaced my copy and the discs play perfectly.  I was scared all the discs would be like that since they're flippers.

4178974,1,B003R4ZMOK,"So I'm starting here with that simple statement, I don't get it. And I just don't. I watched this series just released on DVD and found that I just didn't get the attraction or rave reviews the show has garnered. For a comedy show about a comedian I found it offered very few laughs.

LOUISE tells the story of comedian Louie (played by Louis C.K.). Just divorced and a doting father, it tells of his everyday life and what happens in it. Some moments are touching, some funny and some just perplexing. But it's his life and so we watch what happens. We try to relate to the situations he finds himself in. And short of living in New York I don't think many people do find themselves in most of these situations.

The series covers such topics as dating after divorce, trying to raise kids, having fights with your friends and more. Intermingled with the stories are a few comedic moments but for the most part each episode just feels dry and lacking something. Laughs perhaps?

The series has received all sorts of accolades and comparisons to other series like CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM. I might be in the minority here but that's a series I've never seen. And if it's anything like this one I doubt I'd ever want to.

So what is it about series like this that make people rush to praise them and talk about how wonderful they are? Why is it that shows concerning themselves with the miseries of someone trying to get on with life are entertaining? All I saw here was a man who had great friends but had trouble with a love life or a life at home. Isn't that the life that most people lead? Aren't we all having problems we have to confront and find solutions for daily? And if so and I'm living this, why would I find it entertaining watching someone else do what I do every day? Well I mean with the exception that I'm not making nearly as much money or on TV each week.

I've seen Louis C.K.'s stand up act and know he can be quite entertaining and funny. But there's a difference between writing a stand up routine that is fine tuned over so many weeks on the road and trying to make up new jokes or funny antics on a weekly basis. The episodes I made it through here felt like they were one joke ideas that entire episodes were then built around. A single joke with plenty of filler. It would be as if a regular hamburger were placed on a Big Mac bun and covered with double toppings. Sure the meat was there but it was so covered by other items that you couldn't enjoy it.

I don't know. Perhaps over time I will get what everyone else is saying about shows like these. Perhaps I won't want to. Until then I'll watch things that make me laugh, make me cry, keep me on the edge of my seat or make me jump out of it. As for now I think I'll pass by this one. You should too unless you like something so far off the wall that you can't even find that wall.

I know I'll be raked over the coals by fans who adore the show as has happened to me before here. But the fact remains that not all comedy works for all people. Some may enjoy this while others don't. If you choose to give it a shot, then walk in with an open mind not swayed by my slam or by those who praise it.

4178976,5,B003R4ZMOK,"I love LCK and what I particularly like about him and his comedic viewpoint is that nothing is sacred and everything is worth examining, but nothing is more important or right or worng than anything else.  He is brutally honest. I remember from one of his HBO one-man specials where he says he is not gay but we would certainly do all kinds of sexual things to Brit actor Ewon McGregor because he found Ewon especially attractive and he didn't know why.  It takes a real man with real integrity to say that and I applaud that he always seems to tackle gay issues especially humourously and innocently.  In Season 1 there are lots of references to gay topics and in one particular episode it really hits close to home.  What I like about the show Louie (and his general comedic writing) is that he deals with the weirdness, the stupidity, the craziness, but also the grandness, the profoundness of everyday life. He takes nothing for granted and you can tell he examines life's nuances carefully in his art but yet he can also tackle the big issues: love, sex, religion, politics, art and reveals the comedic, and sometimes tragic, sometimes tragic, sides of these subjects.
I like that he takes what would seem to be on the surface of things a mundane topic but then distorts it and examines it to reveal how really strange life can be. Also, what I like about LCK is that there is a certain innocence to his point of view, so even subjects like penises or vaginas, excrement, or ejaculate (Season 1 is replete with these references), is treated as if they are just a part of life, which if course they are. I also can't help feel in somehow comparing LCK's comedic to that of noted story writer Raymond Carver, who often wrote about everyday people, going through seemingly mundane things in life, but therein lies a certain profoundness in those experiences, and sometimes a comedic one, sometimes heroic, sometimes tragic. It's not the best comparison but there are shades of that feeling when reading Carver's work and listening to LCK. ""Louie"" the show is a real treat because each episode is not how you expect the episode or any episode to develop, there is no formulaic pattern, just some comedic (and often surreal ones at that) moments happening in the life of Louie.",1308873600,2,2277,4.656716417910448

But more than the gleeful excess of serious and honest gut laughter this show provides, there are also some really painful moments in which we find Louie put into an awkward or terrible situation.  These scenes are so tense and gut wrenching it's almost painful to watch, but in a good way.  It's not like the stressful wacky scenarios of Seinfeld, but situations that evoke real feelings of discomfort and embarrassment that's I find really compelling, and an excellent partner to the in your face comedy of the inappropriate.

The balance between regular joke humor and the much more subtle comedy of these horrific situations is struck admirably.

I think this show is a good example of what a real genius in the field can do with complete control of a production.

Its unique, shameless, and most importantly insanely funny, much like Louie himself.  So glad it's getting multiple seasons.",1307836800,23,984,4.8562874251497
4178979,1,B003R4ZMOK,"""Louie"" is a fantastic series and I hope FX sees it through to Louis C.K.'s satisfaction and grants him as many seasons as he likes. However, preliminary artwork has been revealed and shows that the Blu-ray edition will use ""flipper"" discs, with Blu-ray media on one side of a disc, and DVD media on the other side of that same disc (for more examples, see Universal's BD/DVD ""flipper"" releases of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jackal-Combo-Blu-ray-and-Standard-DVD-Blu-ray/dp/B00371QQ34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jackal (Combo Blu-ray and Standard DVD) [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-Africa-25th-Anniversary-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00371QQ5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of Africa: 25th Anniversary (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Traffic-Combo-Blu-ray-and-Standard-DVD-Blu-ray/dp/B00371QQ8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Traffic (Combo Blu-ray and Standard DVD) [Blu-ray</a>]).

Beyond the problem of most consumers paying more for a dual format release, the biggest practical problem with these releases is that you cannot put the disc down anywhere outside of the player or its case, and you must handle the disc by its edges at all times--there is no labeled side that you can rest the disc on while swapping them out, for example.

This type of release is completely unacceptable, and I cannot purchase this set if it is packaged with BD/DVD ""flipper"" discs.

I beg 20th Century Fox to re-consider this poor decision and release the Blu-ray edition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Louie-Season-1-2Disc-Combo-in-Blu-Ray-Packaging/dp/B003R4ZMOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Louie Season 1 2Disc Combo (in Blu-Ray Packaging)</a>&nbsp;with Blu-ray Discs only, or alternatively, with separate Blu-ray and DVD discs.

Again, I cannot support this release until the situation is rectified. My deepest apologies to Louis C.K. and the entire creative team behind ""Louie""; I really hope this message reaches someone at Twentieth Century Fox in time to correct this planned release.",1304812800,51,2214,7.406844106463878
4178980,5,B003R4ZMOK,"As a Brit, I was first introduced to Louis CK by Ricky Gervais, and came across his stand up and previous sitcom, which were pretty good. This series by contrast is by far one of the best television programmes I have seen in years.

Louie is heartfelt and honest, and brutal. It is sometimes very funny, but is best seen as an engaging and witty drama series.

What is particularly exciting is that Louie is entirely autered by its creator Louis CK, who writes, directs, produces, acts as star and edits the show. He comes across as very human in every sense. He bears his soul and shows the dark recesses of his mind and through this his warmth and humanity also shine through.

I can't recommend this show highly enough, it is sometimes challenging as all good television should be, but you can also see each episode in bite size chunks. The contrast between the strength of this show, and the formulaic, tired generic and obvious humor of other traditional sitcoms is very striking.

Watch this programme, it will stay with you.

4178982,5,B003R4ZMOK,"Louie C.K., is one of the funniest people on the planet. ""Lucky Louie"" was equally hilarious, but hampered by it's low budget and HBO not giving it a chance to develop. ""Louie"" seems to give C.K. more freedom, and feels a lot like one of his hilarious stand-up acts. Can't wait to see where this one goes in Season 2.",1300924800,9,317,4.3

I lasted for 5 of the 13 episodes in 2010's Season 1.
