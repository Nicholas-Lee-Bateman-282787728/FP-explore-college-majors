4714068,4,B005K08J8U,"Over 20 years later, Frankenhooker remains a totally trashy treat.  From the mind of Basket Case creator Frank Henenlotter, Frankenhooker revolves around an ex-medical student (James Lorinz) who seeks to bring his fiance (Penthouse pet Patty Mullen) back from the dead after her untimely death via remote control lawnmower.  What follows are some disgusting and hilarious moments, which still remain wonderfully enjoyable even all these years later.  Synapse has done another fine job with this Blu-Ray release, featuring some great special features and a wonderfully restored picture.  While Frankenhooker isn't for everyone, you won't find many films like it, which makes it all the more worthwhile for you to see if you've never experienced what Frankenhooker has to offer.",1330732800,2,776,5.495798319327731
4714069,5,B005K08J8U,"Without giving away too much of the plot,a geeky already unbalanced young scientist loses his loved one in a freak accident.
Let's just say it's rather unusual, in a darkly hilarious way. This drives him to the point of no return, socially isolating
himself and takes desperate steps to preserve her, then is inspired to bring her back, going to some hookers on old 42nd
Street. Coughs up a scheme making a fatal substance he calls,""super-crack"", to acquire the hookers ""parts"", let's just say.

This one is a real hoot. Many hilarious bits throughout. Fans of Henenlotter's other films and grindhouse/cult/exploitation fare will not want to miss this one. It delivers all the goods, of course,:gratuitous nudity, cheesy gureilla-filmmaking FX, and laughable dialogue and bits in all other departments. The gore is downplayed for laughs in this one, intentionally, as this is supposed to be strictly for laughs. There's gore-like FX, delivered in hilariously tongue-in-cheek form. For example,(WARNING:POSSIBLE SPOILERS), exploding hookers. Literally, after consuming the ""super-crack"". Limbs fly all about. Then there's a really twisted ending I don't want to give away, but let's just say, very grotesque and Tales From The Crypt-like.

This is of course, all delivered in a sleazy but light-hearted, tongue-firmly-in-cheek manner. With a seedy background and shady characters throughout. Not for everyone,but surely for those who take all this as a major plus.

The new Blu-Ray courtesy of the great Synapse Films,is outstanding. Presented in anamorphic 1.78:1, colors look sharp and vivid,an appropriate amount of film grain as well. No DNR that I can detect. Given the age and budget of this film, I don't think it's reasonable to expect this to look like a bigger budget or more recent flick.  Audio is presented in a fine DTS-HD MA 5.1 Surround,and DTS-HD MA 2.0 stereo. I can't speak for surround effects as I don't have a surround sound system, but audio is sharp and very clear. Will have no trouble hearing anything.

Comes with a solid collection of extras, ported over from the 2006 Unearthed Films DVD including a very informative and entertaining audio commentary with Frank Henenlotter and FX makeup designer Gabe Bartalos. Lots on info on making this movie, MPAA problems, various actors, the film's reception and reputation etc. Very energetic and funny as well. Then a feature with Patty Mullen, former Penthouse Pet and the film's star. A fairly brief(approx 8 min) but fun and energetic interview. Then, we have a segment covering the film's FX, we get some good behind-the-scenes footage filmed during production, as well as interview with Gabe. We even see him at The Bunny Ranch in NV!Good stuff. Jennifer Delora interview follows up, very informative and fun(approx 21 min). She is really good remembering all kinds of stuff,and then some!(approx 19-20 mins).

All in all, I highly recommend this to genre fans, film buffs, film students or anyone looking for a good time. Synapse Films has done a terrific job as always.",1320710400,3,3046,5.15587044534413
4714070,5,B005K08J8U,"I experienced the joy of getting this HD release a bit early. Don May and Synapse Films have delivered the goods yet again.

The picture quality is of the highest class with a very filmic look. It's Blu-rays like this that make me wish I had the space (and the money) for a proper home theater room with projector. There's a very fine layer of grain present that looks natural but unobtrusive, the remainder of the image very detailed and representative of its film roots. There are some emulsion scratches here and there, but nothing that will take away one's enjoyment. A little more scratch cleanup would have been appreciated in this case, but it's not a problem.

Most of the extras from the Unearthed Films DVD have been carried over, save for a short five-minute photo gallery and some trailers for other films. The exciting trailer for ""Frankenhooker"" is thankfully in HD; I wish more companies would follow Synapse's example and offer HD trailers of the films, particularly when it comes to these cult classics.

The film itself, if you haven't seen it, is a riot--very quirky humor with a bit of a twisted side. I can't imagine anybody not laughing at the exploding hookers scene, or the female body part monsters toward the end (including what special effects artist Gabe Bartalos named ""the Titty Twister""--you'd have to see it to get it). The special effects in these scenes are well-made and with high comical effect. No gore here, just hokey fun. It's difficult to really call this a horror film; whereas Henenlotter's other films--the ""Basket Case"" series, ""Brain Damage"", and ""Bad Biology""--all exhibit rather horrific subject matter and scenes fused with the humor, ""Frankenhooker"" is straight-up comedy.

The performances all around are entertaining with James Lorinz (a.k.a. ""the Doorman from 'Street Trash' "") and Patty Mullen (vivacious Penthouse Pet) leading the show exceptionally well. You'll adore Lorinz' mad scientist depravity, drilling holes into his head to help him think, and Mullen's jittery head movements, face spasms, and snippy dialog.

I suck at writing film reviews, but there it is! Thought I'd talk about the film in addition to the video quality for once.

This is a highly recommended Blu-ray Disc. If you're a fan of the film, ditch the DVD and pick this up; and if you've never seen it before and can laugh at the stranger things in life, buy it and show it to all your friends. Then congratulate Don May for a job well done and pick up every one of Synapse's other Blu-ray Discs (and spam him--lovingly, of course--with requests for ""Street Trash"" and the remainder of the Coffin Joe trilogy to come out soon on the format).",1318809600,9,2671,4.872246696035242
4714071,4,B005K08J8U,"Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict --I love Henenlotter's first film, Basket Case, but for me his masterpiece will always be Frankenhooker. Although Basket Case just oozes exploitation cred, with its gritty shots of the city and wonderfully dated gore effects, Frankenhooker is the perfect blend of mad comedy and exploitation grit. The film didn't do that well at the box office, but it gained a huge cult following, largely because people saw its VHS box, which responded to a button by playing a line from the film. It's in that context that the film really works. It's a goofy film that really wants you to love it. Because of that, it throws everything but the kitchen sink in. There's broad slapstick comedy mixed with copious amounts of nudity and random goofy gore. The film also loves to mix it up between strange interior sets and shots of the Big Apple where the prostitutes live. The mix of gritty realism and comically fantastic makes a beautiful blend.

Henenlotter isn't the only reason the film is a success. The film's two main actors are also perfectly cast. James Lorinz didn't have a lot of experience before taking the lead in Frankenhooker, but he handles the role with charisma to spare. He makes his mad scientist simultaneously manic, sympathetic, and funny. His acting here makes me serious wonder why he didn't immediately become at least a huge cult star in the 1990s. His opposite number--Penthouse Pet Patty Mullen--does an excellent job as Elizabeth as well. She's perfectly comfortable playing both the innocent wife-to-be and the dolled-up Frankenhooker. The guy who plays the pimp, Zorro, is also totally hilarious as both a really threatening guy but also someone who's pretty farcical as well.

I first saw Frankenhooker on an extra-less gray market DVD, and was quite pleased with the 2006 official release. That DVD has been ported to hi-def here, and the results are remarkable. Frankenhooker was never going to look perfect, but this AVC-encoded transfer looks better than I would have expected. There's a little bit of print damage here and there, but overall detail is strong, grain is well-handled, and colors are spot-on. There's a little bit of noise here and there, and black levels could be deeper, but this is way better than those who remember that old VHS would ever expect. The film comes with both a 5.1 and a 2.0 DTS-HD track. Both are excellent, with clear dialogue and great reproduction of the film's score. The 5.1 track adds a bit of low end and occasional surround use.

The extras come straight from the previous DVD special edition. They start with a Henenlotter commentary track (where he's joined by makeup guru Gabe Bartalos), and Henenlotter is his usual informative self. He dishes on the film's production, its problems, as well as its afterlife on video. Then we get a pair of interviews, one with Mullen and the other with Jennifer Delora (who played one of the hookers in the film). Both women seem quite happy with their time on the Frankenhooker set and are happy to share their stories. Delore also provides a ""scrap-book"" with photos from the set. There's also a nice 20-minute featurette on the film's special effects that's includes some nice behind-the-scenes footage. Finally, the film's trailer is included--in HD, no less.

4714072,5,B005K08J8U,"A Minor Classic for Cult fans.

Synopsis: After the tragic death of fiance Elizabeth who died due to a freak lawnmower accident her fiance Jeffery Franken dreams up a too bring her back to life. He decides to give her new body by taking the best body parts from various prostitutes. After he reassembles Elizabeth he gets more then he bargained for when she takes on the persona of the prostitutes who body parts now make up her body and she goes on a rampage through the streets of New York looking for John's who are looking for a date.

Frankenhooker is like a cross between Mary Shelly's Frankenstein and the film Weird Science. Who hasn't dreamed of or wouldn't want to put together a perfect woman. Unlike these other films that explore a similar idea the plot for Frankenhooker sees Jeffrey Franken who wants to bring his dead girlfriend because he misses her and not to advance science. It is also amusing how he wants to give her the perfect body when while she was alive she battled a weight problem.

One of the films strongest assets is its special effects which while at times not perfect they still get the job done. The most memorable scene is when a group of prostitutes start smoking the super crack Jeffery Franken made and then they all start to explode. The most colorful and charismatic character in the film is a pimp named Zorro who brands his ladies with a Z that he burns into their arms. Patty Mullen (Doom Asylum) is also really good especially once she takes on the persona of Frankenhooker. She also gets some of the more memorable lines in the film. James Lorinz (The Sweet Life) is wonderful as the prototype mad scientist Jeffrey Franken and his enthusiasm for his work is infectious.

Part of Frankenhooker's charm is that the film never takes itself seriously. Fans of director Frank Henenlotter who go into the film expecting the gore and violence to be on the same level as his previous films Basket Case and Brain Damage might feel under whelmed since this film relies more on comedy on less on these two things. Overall Frankenhooker is a biting satire that cleverly pays homage to the Frankenstein legacy.

The BluRay:

Frankenhooker comes on a 50 GB dual layer BluRay. The film is presented in a 1080 progressive anamorphic widescreen. For this release Synapse Films have created a brand new 2K high definition transfer from original vault elements. Colors and flesh tones look accurate, black and contrast levels look consistently good and details look sharp throughout. There are no problems with compression and DNR is never an issue.

This release comes with two audio options, a DTS-HD MA 5.1 Surround mix in English and a DTS-HD MA Stereo mix in English. Both audio mixes sound great, with the differences between the two being minimal. Dialog always comes through clearly and everything sounds balanced and the more ambient aspects of the soundtrack are well represented.

When compared to the Unearthed Films DVD release, the audio / video presentation for this new release from Synapse Films is a substantial upgrade.

Frankenhooker was originally released on DVD in 2006 by Unearthed Films and all of the extras pertaining to the film have been carried over for this release. Extras include a theatrical trailer for the film (1 minute 33 seconds - anamorphic widescreen), three interviews, the first interview with actress Patty Mullen (8 minutes 53 seconds - 4:3 full frame), the second interview with actress Jennifer Delora (19 minutes 32 seconds - anamorphic widescreen) and the third interview with special effects advisor Gabe Bartalos (21 minutes - 4:3 full frame) and a image gallery titled `Jennifer Delora's Frankenhooker photo scrapbook' and a audio commentary with director Frank Henenlotter and Gabe Bartalos. The interviews with Patty Mullen and Jennifer Delora, both ladies are candid as they recall in great detail working with director Frank Henenlotter and their experiences making Frankenhooker, while the interview with Gabe Bartalos covers the make-up effects and this segment is filled with a lot of cool behind the scenes footage. Topics covered in the audio commentary track with Frank Henenlotter and Gabe Bartalos include technical aspect of making the film like the special effects, casting and other behind the scenes stories. Also included with this release is reversible cover art. Overall Synapse Films gives Frankenhooker its best audio / video presentation to date.

Funny as hell..Patty Mullen nails the hell out of her role and her funny faces are the best..The part where Zorro the pimp gets knocked out by the flying severed head still makes me laugh out loud..having been a part of the drug culture back in the day really makes this movie extra funny for me because ive been around people like this and its very spot on..I also like how Frank incorporates the purple color in the movie as he did with blue in Brain Damage..another spot on classic favorite of mine..these movies and the first Basket Case will be a part of my collection forever and i never get sick of watching them..saw them all thousands of times and will watch thousands more..too bad he doesnt or isn't making these type movies anymore..i would have loved to see him do the Insect Nation movie he talked about making but said the movie was too far out and disgusting for any studio to take it on.
Too me these b rated low budget funny movies are much more fun and entertaining than todays garbage or any oscar winning movies..glad most are on blu ray and dvd now so i can watch them anytime..there are a few im still waiting to be released but rights issues and ignorant fools are holding them up. Anyhow..i just went blu ray and i know Synapse goes balls out on quality so im gonna grab this edition and still keep my UnEarthed films dvd because i love the menus on it..the extras i hear are the same on the Synapse version but thats fine with me..the interview with the red head girl who played one of the hookers is a trip..cant remember her name(Jennifer?).lol..but she looked like she was flying high on some sort of substance..but was very enthusiastic and proud to discuss her role and the movie..and Patty is still adorable as ever..what a sweet fun cutie she is..too bad she wasn't given other roles..would be cool to see her in another Frankenhooker spin off if someone could come up with a decent script..she's all for it!!..5 stars all the way..if this type movie aint your cup of tea..you are very lame and have no sense of humor..haha!!",1455840000,,2094,4.484293193717278
4714086,5,B005K08J8U,"I have somehow gone 35 years of my life without seeing this movie, deprioritizing it, assuming it's no big deal, sticking to the classics and new releasesboy was that a mistake!!!  After just 7 minutes (yes, I paused and checked) of this B-movie madness I already know two things: 1) this movie is garbage, and 2) this is exactly the kind of garbage I LOVE!

We meet Jeffrey Franken (James Lorinz; Street Trash, RoboCop 3), a man who has somehow been kicked out of three medical schools, and his reanimated Cyclops brain creature experiment that he is working on in the kitchenand everyone simply thinks he's just a little weird for working on a REANIMATED BRAIN with one eye on the kitchen table!!!!  But his whole life is about to change when his fiance Elizabeth (Patty Mullen; Penthouse Pet, Zombinatrix) is killed in a freak accident with a supercharged lawnmower he invented.  The news coverage of the massacre is hilarious!  Oh, yeah, this flick is something special for sure!

Jeffrey Franken is no Victor Frankenstein (2015).  He over-explains his downward spiral into mad scientist mania to his mother as if reading a list of symptoms from a psychiatric manual.  While comically narrating his own insanity he draws elaborate blueprints of electrodes over a body's framework (and it has boobs LOL), power drills his skull to alleviate headaches, and has dates with his fiance's disembodied head.  Needless to say the acting and writing are terrible (but maybe ""good"" for the bad horror genre), but this movie remains a delight.

So since Jeff needs perfect female body parts to bring life back to his fiance, naturally he goes to the city and arranges a prostitute crack-whore party, plays doctor, measures nipples, wrestles hookers and watches them literally explode as they overdose on drugs--and we overdose on cheesiness.  Nudity and disembodied limbs abound.  Jeff superglues and welds his perfect Elizabeth back together from sacks of spare hooker parts, a pile of severed breasts, and a trash can of severed legs with bunyans from extensive streetwalking.

Once Elizabeth is back on her feet after a deliciously B-movied-up Frankenstein's laboratory scene, she stumbles about with all the twitchy grace of a newborn foal and sports a Sylvester Stallone lip sneer.  Assembled from mostly hooker parts, she behaves likewella frankenhooker--all the way down to the undead sex scene during which she sex-electrocutes her first John to death.

Written and directed by Frank Henenlotter (Basket Case 1-3, Brain Damage, Bad Biology), this relatively goreless exploitation cult classic deviates from his violent normal pedigree, having not a scary nor brutal moment--it's pure slapstick comedy shown through a campy horror filter.  A few steps above the raunchier Full Moon releases (Head of the Family, The Killer Eye) or anything from Troma studios, this goofy flick boasts severed heads, abundant bare breasts, mutant monsters made of spare hooker parts and rubber limbs galore!  It's awkwardly weird, strangely funny and classically so-bad-it's-good.  The final twist is quirky campiness at its inappropriate best (think Sleepaway Camp).",1454803200,,3149,5.214285714285714

4714092,4,B005K08J8U,"It's a classic, and this Blu-ray version looks phenomenal, but just on its own merits it probably would earn three stars. It's a little unevenly paced and slow-starting. Director indicated that he cut out all of the full-frontal nudity and I think that that was a mistake for a movie called ""Frankenhooker.""

It does have its moments. The (spoiler alert) exploding hookers, and mutant creatures made out of odds-and-ends body parts, are funny in their absurdity. Patty Mullen is amazing in her role as the female lead, especially considering that she had so little acting experience. And there are a few hot women here who show a little skin.

What elevates this to four stars are the aforementioned beautiful transfer, the impressive DVD authoring and the several extras: a few behind-the-scenes featurettes and a director's commentary. (The SFX designer also is on the commentary track, but in name only since director Frank Henenlotter insisted on shouting over him for the duration.)

This 1990 black comedy cult-trash is about a Jersey mad scientist (Lorinz) who uses the body parts of 42nd St crackwhores to bring back his wife (once Penthouse pet Patty Mullen), recently deceased in a lawn mower mishap. When the electricity strikes and the hooker awakes, across the river to Times Square she goes on the prowl for doomed johns. Raunchy and as silly-as-it-gets, folks with more mainstream tastes will scratch their heads. But if you're a fan of trash cinema and cult films FRANKENHOOKER is kinda like cookie-dough ice cream. One must be a fool not to see the social commentary regarding the crack epidemic which was in full swing when this was made. FYI Blu-Ray features are a real plus.",1344643200,2,837,4.739726027397261

8476342,2,B005K08J8U,"For a movie with such a genious title, it does a poor job living up to it. For those interested, the Frankenhooker doesn't show up until about 3/4 of the way in. You're not missing anything if you don't watch this flick.",1524096000,,220,4.261904761904762

Just read the description and imagine the earnest ineptness that would flow from that origin.

8476347,2,B005K08J8U,"Let me start by saying that I love cheesy, B-movies filled with gratuitous nudity. However, Frankenhooker wasn't nearly as fun and entertaining as I had hoped. (This review is for the actual film, not the quality of the blu-ray, which seemed fine to me.) I really enjoyed the movies, ""My Boyfriend's Back"", ""Night of the Demons"" and ""Re-Animator"". I had never seen Frankenhooker before buying it on Amazon and I figured it'd be similar to the movies just mentioned. It is similar, just not as good. The concept for the movie is funny in my opinion, but it takes the protagonist the entire movie to  ""build"" his Frankenhooker. There's a lot of missed opportunities that are wasted with boring scenes that didn't need to be in the movie. Watch Re-Animator instead.",1509235200,2,762,4.816793893129771
