6582141,3,B00MI85C1O,"Avoid the Drive-In Collections are all pretty poor in just about every respect ...Check out the Peekarama series which are as a whole of much better quality and better then most hard core flicks at a very good price for double sex features. Which show all, but not kinky as a whole, fair reproduction. Not a tease as many, but non-stop action,and often the actors are really enjoying themselves ...can be rough and crude yet still sensitive at times

Better then most current x rated type films which seems more artificial and twisted",1418774400,3,534,4.741935483870968

6582144,5,B00MI85C1O,Easily one of the best archival releases of the year.  William Lustig's first two films have never looked better and they are both presented uncut with some tremendous extras (including two amazing commentary tracks with Lustig and Refn).  Outstanding in every way!,1410134400,20,265,5.285714285714286

8672489,5,B00MI85C1O,"Interesting to turn on the director's commentary option, if you're interested in that sort of thing. 'Violation' is the better of the two movies as far as story line and plot is concerned, but are you really concerned that much about story line and plot? All in all, a good look at the style of this type of genre back in the late '70s. Personally, I think it has more character and substance than today's similar genre, but to each his own.",1461283200,2,441,4.390243902439025

8672491,5,B00MI85C1O,"Wow talk about retro 1970's porn! The Billy Bag Double Feature is awesome to say the least, both films have some scenes shot in pre Disney Times Square. Some say 1970's NYC was a cesspool but you know what? NYC was a very vibrant and original in that era and william Lustig captured some of that energy in these films. Mr lustig went by the name of Billy Bagg during this period.",1430611200,13,379,4.277777777777778

8672493,5,B00MI85C1O,"I loved both of these movies.......greatly. Vintage eroticism like this is too cool......a ""throwback"" to my my High School days of the 70's. Is it just me......but does every movie Jamie Gillis participates in....he plays the role of a sick bastard? Says a little about Jamie....doesn't it.",1427932800,11,291,5.212765957446808
