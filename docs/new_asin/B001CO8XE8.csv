8288367,5,B001CO8XE8,"Traces of Death 4 gives you a good reason to be ""Proud to be an American"" and reafirms that there is ""No prayer for the dying"".

I started this movie with hesitant curiosity, as I knew the after effects from watching the previous installments; I anticipated in dismay what horrors waited behind the (play-less) state from this episode at the time being. Already being fully aware of the vulgar display of frightening realism (that undoubtedly progressed) through-out 3 prior installments I unknowingly stepped into another fantastically gruesome ""hay-ride"" headed straight for and visiting ""the gates of hell"" regarding humanity.

I knew I could ""hack"" it, hell I just made it thru extreme footage of horrendous deaths such as someone in great political power ""blow his brains out"" with a 357 Magnum ""Dirty Harry"" style, over past wrong doings. Am I at fault for decidedly showing an interest in such atrocious activity? As much as I wanted to push away the thought of such repulsiveness I could not stop myself from watching even more. I shoved back the thoughts of horror that awaited and unwittingly pressed play...

Darron (Brain Damage) stood in a cemetery full of old and gothic tombstones. He wore a black leather jacket that displayed ""Dead Alive Productions"" underneath his ""NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD"" drawn letters that advertised ""TRACES OF DEATH"". His back was again to the camera. Who was this man with the long ""80's metal hair"" who offered no explanation to his apparent display of unrelenting morbid fascination with utterly disturbing media footage? Just as history had shown this was not something someone involved in this supposed ""cult"" was willing to share.

This is demonstrated by recorded narration from ""BRAIN DAMAGE"" proclaiming the following message (this is all said as he is digging up a fresh grave within this gothic cemetery!): ""When we left before, you were ""dead and buried"" locked six feet under. From beyond the grave I`ve heard your agonizing screams, like a blood drenched vision you burned in your brain. Your images of death are growing stronger. The message is clear... Brain Damage is back and traces of death is resurrected!!! {Beep... Beep... Beep... The title screen pulsates like a beating heart for a brief moment before ---------

Let the spectacle of death resume... Ghastly ""haunted house"" like music quietly plays in the back ground. ""During the elections in El-Salvador these two male bodies were found on the side of the road."" The camera zooms in on two men with their throats cut so deeply that ear to ear would be an understatement. Someone at the crime scene is rotating the first man's head by the hair to allow better examination by a camera. His neck looked like a second mouth that would only speak out against the horrid fate that had descended down upon it.

The ""media eye"" moves to his partner in crime opposite the road beside him. His neck is slashed so deeply that only the spine has kept its connection with the rest of its body.

Why would someone do this? What terrible wrong did they do to deserve such barbaric cruelty? Knowing that basically ""spitting on the sidewalk"" is punishable by death in certain parts of the world led me to believe that this brutality cannot be rationalized. Apparently those who live in this region by tradition felt the same way. Military police stood around the road as the bodies were roughly picked up and slung into beat around pickup trucks as carelessly as they were tossed on the side of the road. Their faces are cold and unaffected. This is business as usual in the day in the life of El-Salvador.

If any notion of remorse was felt by the people or the authorities it was kept hidden. Obviously who's calling the shots around here is no other than the El-Salvadorian Death Squad. A code of silence is in effect here and even the authorities know that if it is broken they too will meet with the same or even more wickedly disastrous results.

Get ready to ""head-bang"" Darron's selection of Death Metal from the hottest bands in the underground music industry blast forward... The song ""Bastard Saints"" is played over footage of poor third world countries and its citizens that are stricken with neglectful and punishing untreated diseases and deformities. Men, women and children lie helplessly on crude steel beds (with a blanket to help ease the suffering as they lie in agonizing non-treatment).

This is watched over by those that secretly have compassion for their fellow man. It is sad to see anyone endure such atrocity especially the children! Let it be said that even if provisions were available to aid in these impossible states of suffering thru recovery and treatment, their efforts will no doubt, be answered with violent repercussions. A deep throat slashing and discarding of your remains (dumped like trash) at the side of a road.  It is clear that sometimes mercy is death.

Shortly after this tearful display they show a pregnant patient at another ""underground"" clinic discovered by the Death Squad.  Pay back for this unforgiving compassion was allowing this woman to rot and steadily decay as a public display on her blanket of comfort; this woman was treated low budget style like the ""David Blaine trapped in ice for 3 days"" gag... Imagine the slow but rapid chemical change in the decaying body and living with that visually on your street every day? The rotting dead human has the most rancid smell that at the more advanced stages of decay is carried for Miles and miles and will be a warning and a reminder to all who oppose the Death Squad.

A torture segment displaying the Death Squads handy work will include victims without eyes, headless and brutally slashed bodies lined up in a row.

A cool down period begins with foolish stunts by those jumping off extremely high structures and doing flips in the air, one man doesn't complete his sixth flip and lands on his neck. His neck cracks out in a deafening silence. In a scene from ""When animals attack"" a Moose strikes back unexpectedly on a passerby in a public street in Colorado. The music is completely kick as$ here, so close your eyes if necscery and enjoy the music. More Third world children are shown while suffering along with severe cases of leprosy as an old woman shows her skills of knitting without any fingers... That is a display of strength and courage in the face of ""true"" adversity.

Also a disease known as elephantiasis has plagued a man through his testacies for so long that three men must lift up and carry them behind him. When he sets down this gigantic deformity is used as a built in table for the man to eat, write and work on!  Don't get too warm and cozy yet, Darron is now going to show you his most extensive collection of deformed, pre- maturely born infants with afflictions too terrible for me to repeat through words or another viewing. Some of them are actually still clinging to life!

This is followed by a series of ""Birth defects"" from all different sources from a vast period of time. The miracle of birth, in all of its unique and unusual forms (Siamese twins hermaphrodites and fleshly distortions that are hard to recognize as human, among many other freakishly disgusting oddities endured by humans.

The ""killer music"" continues as more montage murders, mass executions and senseless bombings are featured. This will include tapes smuggled out of Iraq and Afghanistan. A new direction will take course from this point on and it begins with a brief narration from Brain Damage as is quoted here: ""PLO"" terrorists high- jacked  this boat and made their way to Cypress there were no living witnesses to tell of this crime""! People spree murdered, captured, bound and ""left for dead"".

(One interesting note was that I noticed in all of these foreign countries that are controlled by participants of these types of atrocities, (not crime) as this would imply illegality on the part of the violent order that is controlled by Death Squad regimes) was that they all use the same kind of rope: a blue twine like material... one of my friend's from the Gulf War noticed this as well and said ""I've heard about being ""all wrapped up in RED TAPE"" but evidently all of these terrorists must shop at the same store because every one of them f'ers is tying up people with personal politics with ""Blue Velvet"" like rope... maybe it could be intertwined???

The rest of the sequences back off a tad bit and go back to the basics: Dead bodies, decaying worm eaten skulls and maggots engulfing the decaying human (the classic TOD stuff) now however having withstood the series this long feels like a ""slow stroll through the park"" as this now becomes the cool down periods instead of auto accidents and motorcycle wrecks. Darron is on to something here but I'm not sure why I feel mentally toughened by reinforced rapid desensitization.

No time to think about it now because Darron is going to show a body art and piercing segment to get your mind back in the game. It starts out innocently enough; a woman having a (click) piercing and then showing a woman who has 37 vaginal piercings and lets not forget TOD never forgets the men! Out of the Previous T.O.D's this one is the shortest and sickest one yet!

Once again Darron has succeeded in causing me as a viewer to feel a sense of guilt for watching it to this point, no accusations by him are made and no explanations are given as to what it is I was actually seeing. I was left on my own to wrestle with speculative thought based on the vastness of probability: My convictions and my own accusing.
