4066059,3,B0033XKV96,"Cartoons older than 1953 were filmed in different aspects as to when they are put into widescreen, it will look a little odd. That is why Warner Bros used the fake widescreen matting. It is as simple as that. I have the majority of the shorts on other Looney Tunes releases, but they have a better video quality on this single disc than on the previous releases. The shorts, like Daffy's Inn Trouble, have been restored to their original versions with nothing edited out. This isn't the best Looney Tunes release, but it is not as bad as what other reviewers have said.

The 15 shorts are:

Tick Tock Tuckered
Nasty Quacks
Daffy Dilly
Wise Quackers
The Prize Pest
Design for Leaving
Stork Naked
This is a Life?
Dime to Retire
Duck the Devil
People Are Bunny
Person to Bunny
Daffy's Inn Trouble
The Iceman Ducketh
Suppressed Duck",1347753600,2,828,4.587837837837838
4066060,3,B0033XKV96,I have all the Looney Tunes Golden collections and me and my family loves them all. What I did like about this collection is both the Bugs and Daffy cartoons weren't duplicated. There were some classic stuff I was looking for too and got it. The problem here was the cropping to widescreen. Tops of heads were cutoff and it makes me wonder who was the editor that ruined these collections. Did anyone checkout the finished product? I understand that the newer collections after these were made are in full screen and I hope the new Bugs and Daffy DVDs down the road follow the same coarse.,1305072000,3,589,4.514018691588785
4066061,4,B0033XKV96,"I really hate how people all over Amazon are complaining about the fact that the post-1953 cartoons are ""matted"" to look widescreen. I'll admit it was a bit of a stupid idea for WHV to do that and I'm glad they stopped, but it doesn't cover up any IMPORTANT parts of the image anyway, so I don't think it's worth all the complaining.

What IS worth complaining about (hence the removal of a star) is that the cartoon entitled ""This Is a Life?"" is pretty much a CLIP SHOW of Bugs Bunny cartoons that have already been released on the LTGC sets. I wish they included another Daffy Duck cartoon like ""Beanstalk Bunny"" instead. Otherwise, it's EXCELLENT!

What's GOOD about the DVD is that almost ALL of the shorts are restored (except for ""Tick Tock Tuckered"", which is a bit grainy), and it even includes the uncut version of ""Daffy's Inn Trouble"" (which is often edited on TV to remove a scene where Daffy tries to shoot Porky only to end up shooting himself), which is also my FAVORITE on the disc!

So stop complaining/worrying about the fake ""matting"" and BUY THIS DISC TODAY!",1301702400,6,1078,4.546391752577319
4066062,5,B0033XKV96,"I'm not normally one to write reviews for these things, but after reading all the negative reviews I had to put my two-cents in. Now the gripe with this set is that the cartoons are presented in a widescreen format, but when the cartoons are ripped from the disc that tells a different story. ALL the cartoons, but ""Design for Leaving"" ripped from the disc in a 4:3 format. I even played the DVD myself in a DVD player just to get both sides of the story. At first it played in widescreen (very grainy picture), but a simple click on ""Maintain Default Aspect Ratio"" and it turned to 4:3 in an instant (with better picture quality). On the back of the box it even says that it is presented in the standard format (preserving the original theatrical exhibition). So if you are on the fence and at least have a little technical know how, then please buy this DVD, we may never see them released ever again. Thank you Warner Bros., and I would love to see more of Daffy in the future. Please!

P.S. As soon as I can get my hands on a camera, I will post a video review.",1297900800,12,1065,4.246305418719212
4066063,4,B0033XKV96,"Hey, it's Daffy Duck. Yeah, the less-than-perfect formatting is less than perfect, but these cartoons are still pretty fun, particularly the later Chuck Jones material, and having fifteen Daffy Duck cartoons that were not on the earlier collections is kinda nice. I just watched the disc with my kid and we laughed plenty... I mean, it's DAFFY for cryin' out loud!  This product may be imperfect, but it's still fun, and I'm sure these cartoons will be properly restored someday to a state that will make purists happy - in the meantime, I'd be glad to buy your used copy. :-)",1295308800,,576,4.702970297029703
4066064,2,B0033XKV96,"The ""Golden Collection"" of Warner Brothers ""Looney Tunes"" and ""Merrie Melodies"" classics drawn from a wide variety of years are all very good to exceptional. Unfortunately, ""Daffy Duck: Frustrated Fowl"" isn't one of them. While the cartoons included here are from good to exceptional, the presentation is not. Someone at Warner made the bean counting decision to present these in widescreen. They weren't planned, shot or ever presented in widescreen. As a result, the image has been stretched and cropped to fit modern TV's; that's a bad thing because much of the humor here is VISUAL so some of the humor is blunted as a result.

You can read elsewhere about what is presented here but my focus isn't on the content but the presentation which is badly done. I'm really surprised that Warner who usually does an exceptional job of presenting their classics has chosen NOT to reissue these titles correctly. As of this date (1/11)these have not been transferred correctly for this set. That's too bad because these cartoons many of which haven't appeared on home video anywhere may not get another release unless Warner corrects the problem and reissues these.

My advice avoid this set along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bugs-Bunny-Hare-Extraordinaire-Looney-Tunes-Super-Stars/dp/B0033XKVEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bugs Bunny: Hare Extraordinaire (Looney Tunes Super Stars)</a>.

4066065,4,B0033XKV96,"The cartoon selections on this collection are all top notch! Most of these I haven't seen in years. They are all ""Old School DAFFY""! The funny, crazy, LOONEY Daffy! The one who yells out ""Hoo! Hoo!"" while bouncing around all over the place. You know, before the 60's regime ruined him by turning him into a bitter, foul, Fowl. Pairing him with Speedy Gonzales & such other nonsense. Picture quality is pristine & the sound is crisp & clear. The only downside is that there is ZERO, Nada, Zilch as far as bonuses go. No booklet, no documentaries, commentary - NOTHING!!! If it weren't for this, it would be a Five Star collection.",1292371200,,629,4.575221238938053
4066066,2,B0033XKV96,"Mandatory, inappropriate widescreen. No extras. No care taken in menus or presentation. Something has come off the rails at Warner. That's OK, I'll wait until someone else is in charge and decides to do the right thing and continue proper restorations. Until then, if you were a fan of the Golden Collections, don't bother with these, they are a travesty.",1291161600,6,355,4.933333333333334
4066067,1,B0033XKV96,"I was really looking forward to this and the new Bugs Bunny release but will absolutely NOT be buying either because of the cropping.  My God!  We FINALLY got to the point where studios realized we don't want pan-and-scan and now they crop tops and bottoms!  What next?  If there are morons out there who can't support the fact that their TV screen isn't completely filled the least WB could have done would have been to make it a 2-sided disc - with the original aspect ratio on one side and the cropped versions on the other.  As it is, it's worthless.",1289865600,3,554,4.392156862745098
4066068,3,B0033XKV96,"From what I can tell, this is good edition for people who own all the Golden Collection discs (or the abbreviated spotlight version, or whatever they call that.)

There's some amusing cartoons here.  In spite of what some reviews seem to indicate, there are cartoons with both versions of Daffy here - ""daffy"" Daffy, and ""annoying"" Daffy.

I admit to not having seen all the episodes, but what I have seen are ok.  There's some Bugs and a Taz in here too ( a Taz I don't recall having seen before.)

Near as I can tell, the complaints about the picture being cropped are probably true.  When I view it in widescreen, it looks normal, and when I view it in 4:3, it looks squashed.  Which probably means they chopped the top and bottom of the cartoons to manage that (as I think all the cartoons were in 4:3 aspect.)  Why anyone would think that's acceptable is beyond me.  But I am not going to fly off the handle and suggest it's the end of the world.  It's artist castration though, I agree.

Anyway, I am pleased with the purchase, as I have seen most of the Golden collection episodes many times, and there's some stuff here I have never seen.",1288828800,,1146,4.38388625592417

8388147,5,B0033XKV96,"Daffy Duck is my second favorite cartoon character after Sylvester.  This DVD has him going up against Elmer Fudd, Porky Pig, and even the cartoonist.  As usual Daffy's antics cause him great pain but he keeps coming back for more.
There is an annoying statement about the perceived prejudices of the era when the cartoons were made.  It is annoying because it sticks and will not release to the main menu.  Try using a different reader and go to chapter index and work your way thru to the menu page.  I have found this also in the Sylvester DVD.",1512432000,,547,4.484848484848484
