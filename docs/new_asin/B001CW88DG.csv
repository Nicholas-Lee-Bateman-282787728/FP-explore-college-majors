3520398,5,B001CW88DG,This is the second DVD I have purchased from Proactive Soccer and Coach Paul Janaway. The latest product is a great teaching tool. It gives me an opportunity to have my players get more touches on the ball in a fun setting. The drills are challenging yet obtainable with a little practice. I found them just challenging enough that the boys will keep at it until they can master them. Well thought out!!,1229385600,3,403,4.534246575342466
3520399,5,B001CW88DG,Your soccer player will love mastering the tricks that Coach Janaway presents and demonstrates.  The tricks will build their confidence and give them the edge they'll need in competitive play.  Another winner from Proactive soccer.,1229385600,3,231,5.571428571428571
3520400,5,B001CW88DG,"This is a stage by stage learning program for each trick and move. It has a fast shot ;a slow shot with graphics; another slow shot and then fast shot again. It has been designed using the visual learning technique which has been proven as the best way to learn these tricks. ""Tell me and I will listen, show me and I will learn""

This is an amazing learning tool for people interested in developing new tricks. The kids seem to love doing tricks and this stage by stage process really works. They learn by watching!! Don't they learn everything that way..think about it! This has my kid out in the yard practicing!
Don't waste your money on the more expensive DVD's, this did the job for us!",1219968000,4,692,4.40625
3520401,5,B001CW88DG,"I'm a bit of a clumsy clod, so showing my son--little Mike--how to do the tricks he wanted to do was nearly impossible.  This video made my job easy.  Now we're both doing the tricks we've always dreamed about.",1218672000,2,210,4.358974358974359
3520402,5,B001CW88DG,I've been working my way through all the tricks in this video and I'm picking up some good skills. I play on a weekend league and have already benefited from this DVD. I watch it on my laptop while I practice in the yard. Super fun.,1218672000,2,232,4.065217391304348
8290223,5,B001CW88DG,This is great for adults and kids to watch. They have slow motions that helps too. Hope I can do the tricks one day!,1375228800,,116,3.875
8290224,2,B001CW88DG,"First off, the video just shows how the tricks are done - I would think that an instructor or coach would have been a good choice to add besides the player demonstrating.
Secondly, for each trick you want to look at you have to select it from the menu... No option to just have the video play through.  So each trick you then have to scan through the menu to the next trick you want to see then select play.

Not a fan at all...",1356739200,,428,4.023529411764706
8290225,3,B001CW88DG,"- The DVD is helpful if you do not have any other resources
- Other DVD present only the relevant tricks and with better coaching/narration
- This is a ""budget"" version of other DVDs. Scenes are performed in a backyard, by young players, and coaching points are only shown on the screen without narration.",1302220800,,305,4.666666666666667

8290227,5,B001CW88DG,"When I first watched this DVD, I was amazed at how effective it teaches each trick. ""Soccer Tricks"" shows each move with superb depth and detail. The slow motion replays break down each skill step by step, in an easy to follow, extensive manner. In addition, the normal speed replays show the viewer how the trick should be performed at high speed, game situations.

Quite simply, this is a fantastic DVD at a great value. You will not regret purchasing ""Soccer Tricks"". Whether you are looking to impress your friends with new skills, or humiliate opposing defenders in your next soccer game, this DVD is for you. This is another masterpiece from Coach Janaway.",1264291200,,662,4.807017543859649
8290228,1,B001CW88DG,"I purchased this for my daughter who is 11.  While the names of the ""tricks"" are different they are moves that probably all soccer players know-the roller-coaster, fake and take, etc-but they just call them something else.  The DVD has very annoying music and you have to push play between every ""trick"".  Honestly, don't waste your money.",1239667200,,339,4.912280701754386
