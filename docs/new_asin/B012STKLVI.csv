8726528,2,B012STKLVI,"This review is of the series content only.

As each episode passes this series gets lamer and lamer.  The acting feels geared towards elementary school children.  In what could have been a great premise this is put in a basket of ""blah"".",1478908800,3,237,4.595238095238095
8726529,5,B012STKLVI,This series was excellent. I only wish it were still on tv. I looked forward to watching it every weekend. If you all are into a clean western with less mild language then this is your show. Great actors and amazing twists and turns. The last episode will have you wishing for more episodes. Please support shows like this one because there's too many shows out today that aren't appropriate. A MUST SEE!,1476748800,6,404,4.5479452054794525
8726530,1,B012STKLVI,Watched the first episode. Acting was universally amateurish. I just could not justify spending time on watching the rest of this series. Very disappointing.,1464134400,4,157,5.583333333333333
