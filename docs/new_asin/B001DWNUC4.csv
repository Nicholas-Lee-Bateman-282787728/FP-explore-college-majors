3541431,1,B001DWNUC4,This show was cringe-inducingly bad.  The lack of chemistry between the co-hosts is overcompensated for with either awful writing or awful adlibbing.  They make glaring mistakes from an engineering and scientific stand-point and it just doesn't work. They're trying too hard to be MythBusters or something. I'm definitely happy this show got canned. It was insulting of Discovery to think that people would enjoy this tripe.,1326412800,2,424,5.409090909090909
3541432,1,B001DWNUC4,"The cast wants to be a mythbuster but they continuously make silly and stupid mistakes. The create a small house to see what happens when a tornado/hurricane hits. (They fail to secure the building to the ground and the house gets blown away. They are testing the strength of a 2x4 versus a 2x4 wrapped with carbon fiber... their testing is conducted by the four of them standing on the board... the regular 2x4 snaps with the three guys and the girl standing on the guys feet. The carbon fiber covered 2x4 doesn't snap but the 4 of them are lined up and the weight is distributed differently.

How do you make a house wild fire proof? You wrap it in a fire retardent material like the stuff worn by nascar drivers... the stuff works... except when you leave the frayed edges exposed to heat... they light up... duh... stupid bad science spelled the doom for this show.",1317513600,3,869,4.5

It teaches creative problem solving and the reality that not all innovative ideas work.  We wish there were more.",1224547200,5,282,5.086956521739131
3541434,1,B001DWNUC4,"Let me be frank here... there's only one reason to watch this show... If you want to see vague pseudo-scientific solutions to non-existent problems fail in spectacular ways.

That's it. The producers of this show took real world problems then saddled their cast with ""solving"" them by applying unworkable solutions.

It was almost like I could feel IQ points being forcibly sucked from my body every minute as I watched this show.

The second season got better because they allowed the cast to come up with their own solutions instead of pre-assigning one. But still...

Terrible show.",1223856000,3,585,5.0

And as long as you're not looking for some deep research-based, educational (how things work) sorta show, you'll enjoy this series for it's ability to simply make you think about how to creatively solve problems in unconventional ways.

8295187,5,B001DWNUC4,"I don't know why people are putting hate in the comments. So what, it's like Mythbusters? That matters? So what, they think aerated concrete can stop cars? It can! It just has to be low density! So what, advertising Rhino truck liner? They weren't! They were showing its strength! So what, they never do paperwork? Have you ever thought that maybe they do it off screen? All this hate against the show is the reason it was canceled. The reason there will never be another season. The reason I will never be able to watch the new episodes that have just been published. Shame on all of you! Shame on everyone who is hating on this! I won't be surprised if you gave all the team members, in the first and second seasons, to die of sadness! You should be ashamed, all you haters! I think this show is one of the best I've seen. You haters wanna hate on a show that would've been succesful until it's canceled? Go hate on My Little Pony! At least that show deserves some haters! Sheez.",1436140800,,981,4.366120218579235

8295190,1,B001DWNUC4,"No two shows are the same. I get that. But when a television show is advertised like another show, I expect the shows to be similar. Granted, I only saw this episode, but I couldn't watch more. This is the pilot, the one that is supposed to draw me in. And it failed. The chick is on there to be a chick, I can see no other purpose for her. The experiments seem half done at best. The team gets so excited over so little in the beginning, it's hard for me to get excited with them later. This is not my type of show.",1394150400,,516,3.9238095238095236
8295191,1,B001DWNUC4,"Let me begin my rant with an interesting statistic: In 2012, U.S. children grades K-12 ranked 25th place in mathematics and 17th place in science when compared to other countries. Some stats looked marginally better when broken down by age group, but overall, we're a bunch of dolts!  This show is living proof of the failure of America's education system.

My review is based on the first episode, I couldn't handle any more!  Is this what passes for science these days?  What a bunch of dumb shmucks!  So they think they're going to stop a car traveling at 60 mph by using the same methodology used by airports to arrest an aircraft overshooting the runway?

We begin by watching a video of a large jet liner making an emergency stop using a material known as aerated concrete. Without any follow-on research, it was concluded this would be a good way to stop cars.  Did anyone bother to ask the company that installed the arrestor strip at the airport the composition of the concrete?  Did anyone bother to determine the weight and speed of the plane? Did anyone bother to determine the total force on the nose wheel as it sunk into the aerated concrete?  In fact, did you see ANYONE do ANYTHING remotely resembling mathematics or physics?

Did anyone bother to consult highway engineers? Had these people done their homework, they would have learned that such barriers are, in fact, already in use on many highways cut through mountainous and extremely hilly terrains.  Why this obsession with aerated concrete when there's a simpler and cheaper solution already in use -- SAND!  Try driving your car through three foot of loose sand!

All of their ""tests"" were failures that could have been predicted in advance with pencil, paper and a calculator. A 4,000 lb car rests on 4 wheels, each supporting (roughly) 1,000 lb. For each wheel, the weight is distributed over an area of (guessing here) 6"" x 6"" (36 square inches); that gives us a rough surface pressure of 28 lbs per square inch.

In order for the car to ""sink"" into the concrete, the material must lose cohesion under a pressure of 28 psi -- something the so-called ""scientist"" could have easily tested with a SMALL sample of concrete back at the lab. Instead of guessing about the concrete-to-air ratio (i.e., low, medium, high), they could have gotten precise tables from the concrete company and determined the proper density ahead of time. Even, if you carefully lowered a 4,000 lb car equipped with regular tires onto a deep bed of sand, it will sink 3-4 inches right from the start, that's a lot of resistance to forward motion. Then one has to consider the ""snowplow"" affect as the forward motion causes the sand to build up in front of the tire.

But the really BIG mistake in this program was the failure to ask the REAL engineers who designed the airport runway stop-strip as to WHY they chose this particular material.  But we'll never know as our intrepid ""scientist"" and ""engineer"" never bothered to ask such an important question.  About the only person who seemed to know what he was doing was the stunt driver!

Airplanes are not cars, they're built to fly, not drive around on the ground. Stopping a huge jet liner without injuring crew and passengers is a whole different box of apples compared to stopping a car, any REAL scientist / engineer would have understood this at the outset. Instead, we see a bunch of clueless morons spending a lot of money on something that was destined to fail -- sorta like the way Government works.",1367539200,4,3512,4.71078431372549
