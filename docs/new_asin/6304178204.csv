7864449,5,6304178204,"I was actually able to purchase an audio only version of this on ""I Tunes"" for a few dollars.  I enjoyed it a lot and was able to listen to it while taking a walk, using my ""I Pod"".

General MacArthur is an epic figure, and as usual, there are two schools of thought about him.  If one is interested in a complete study of this complicated man, one might consider ""American Caesar"" by William Manchester.  Thank You...",1477699200,,418,4.32051282051282

7864454,4,6304178204,"My hubby is a LTC, he had nothing nice to say about MacArthur, but that doesn't mean that he didn't do a lot of things well in his lifetime.  This is a brief biography with appropriate content for middle or high school.  I found it interesting, as I am a middle grades teacher who doesn't have a whole lot of experience with much after the Civil War.  I have posted a viewing guide for this video on teacherspayteachers website.",1348185600,3,428,4.3924050632911396

7864456,5,6304178204,"It's so very easy to condem someone. Let's just take a moment to look at the BIG Picture.  MacArthur was a human being if I remember correctly. We all have our weak moments. Humans some times do make mistakes and he did make a few serious mistakes.  If your not biased or overly prejudice, then look at the Real complete FACTS and Big picture of MacArthur. Let us not attempt to twist and distort the true facts. Let us read the whole historical book not just one or two small paragraphs in the book. If you want to take something out of context, then just read one or two paragraphs about someone's few mistakes. Just read the facts about this Great Great man purely from a historical view point. Gerneral of the Army Douglas MacArthur, dispite a few of his human short commings was not an Angel as some may believe. He was though, a True Military Genius in every sense of the word!

The man really had his moments of True Genius. A truly brilliant man and leader. Oh, leaders do make a few mistakes, but General Douglas MacArthur made so many great and intelligent decisions during world war II, Korea and in Japan that his human mistakes prior to WWII were blown into oblivion where they belong. His great decisions out weighed 100,000 times over and above the mistakes he made prior to WWII. Any one who can read and write and is not ignorant can easily see this. You would have to be deaf dumb and blind to read only one paragraph in a book and JUDGE a book only by its' cover, as some people are so happy to do. Gerneral Douglas MacArthur was really a true military genius and great leader who I have the greatest respect and admiration for. He was the best of the best Gernerals this country ever had. He was a God given gift to this great country and to Japan after the war ended.",1128297600,12,1788,4.347305389221557
7864457,1,6304178204,"What a joke.  General Douglas MacArthur's contributions to victory in World War II are slight at best!  If you want to know the truth  about this man and what his accomplishments (or lack thereof) REALLY were, as  well as what is taught in the military acadamies of this country, try reading some of the biographies about MacArthur that go beyond the surface.  Want an example?  How about letting the largest concentration of B-17  bombers west of Pearl Harbor be destroyed ON THE GROUND!  Nearly 18 hours passed between the time Pearl Harbor was attacked and this man did NOTHING.  His career throughout World War II is full of similar instances that cost lives, money and the foreign policy of the United States.  He was against the leap-frogging policy that the he later claimed as his own idea by using the baseball phrase ""hit-em where they ain't!""  He fought hard against that idea until he saw that it worked.  He was also against the whip-saw strategy of attack in the pacific.  There are other books (Eric Larrabee's ""Commander in Chief"" is the best) that de-myth the mythical general.  Don't buy this video!  The  people responsible for it should be ashamed for the poor and shameful job in not finding the truth about this man and instead, they took the easy way out in putting this superficial ""biography"" together.  It is full of lies and distortions.  A&E, you really should be ashamed!",951868800,15,1400,4.7625
