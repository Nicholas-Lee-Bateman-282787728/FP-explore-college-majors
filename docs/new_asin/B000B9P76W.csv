But be warned, if you watch it everyday for three weeks straight, it gets a bit boring. ^_^",1202428800,,249,4.813953488372093
8446737,5,B000B9P76W,"Ah, do you love Tom Jones?  No, not the Welsh lounge singer, the 18th Century novel by Henry Fielding so ably brought to life by Albert Finney in the 60's and again by Max Beesley in the British television series of this century.  Haggard, much in the spirit of Tom Jones deals with the same line of country-- the British Squirearchy of the 18th century.  But where Squire Allworthy and his adopted son Tom are examples of the good hearted English gentlemen of the period, Squire Haggard is the relentlessly impecunious gamester, his son a sad rake.  Their only unencumbered asset is Grunge, the Steward, who both envies Haggard's social standard while preaching about the rights of man.
Each of the 14 episodes opens with Squire Haggard writing in his journal, recording the relentlessly dismal weather and the (often fatal but always hilarious) misfortunes of his fellow denizens of 18th century Britain.",1089331200,5,906,4.940789473684211
