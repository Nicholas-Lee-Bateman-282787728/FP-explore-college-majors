8472639,5,B005H3K17M,A blockbuster theory which rings very true. Real food for thought.,1493078400,,66,5.090909090909091
8472640,1,B005H3K17M,"An interesting 'documentary' by a 'doctor'. Most of Dr. Strecker's 'claims' are 'almost' ridiculous. I once heard a speech in the 1980s about 'chemical and biological warfare. that hinted at the threat of AIDS/HIV. It had a line that said (about HIV/AIDS) ""How can it be in a book from 1969 under Chemical And Biological Warfare. That made me think.

This 'documentary also made me 'think' --- that 'people' are innately stupoid.

Maybe Robert Strecker (the Doctor) actually DOES believe what he's 'genuinely' describing herein. Who can say. He seems and sounds 'adamant'.

If you believe that the HIV/AIDS virus is a laboratory concocted disease then this dvd will NOT dissuade you.
If you believe it's a 'naturally' occurring disease then this dvd will annoy you.

It's an interesting find nonetheless...",1483660800,,806,5.129770992366412

8472644,5,B005H3K17M,"While this is the DVD, I purchased the VHS format in 1989. I attended the 1st International Conference on Alternative Medical Therapies for AIDS in 1989 in San Diego, CA. Both events confirmed to me, AIDS was not just some accident wherein a green monkey bit some unlucky African but there was something much more sinsiter going on. In the presentation, Dr. Strecker gives overwhelming evidence and a logical sequence of events pointing to the US Army's secret development of an organism capable of attacking and destroying the host's immune system. What is most troubling is that the US Congress approved and financed the project from our own tax dollars.
During 1988 thru 1993, I worked as a medical assistant for 3 different alternative medical doctors who treated AIDS patients using Vitamin C IV drips, Anthropomorphic medicine, herbs and ozone therapy. I personally experienced the steady improvements and conversly, unfortunate deaths of a several dozen patients. This put me in a unique postition to understand what Dr. Strecker presented in his Memorandum. It was this information and that from renowned virologist, Dr. Peter Deusberg, that opened my eyes to the truth about AIDS.
Not one to just trust what Dr. Strecker claimed, I copied all the references at the end of the tape (had to continually hit the pause button to write down the information). Over the next few months in 1989 and since then, I have spent hundreds of hours at both medical and law libraries photocopying and downloading (PDF files) the documents and studies, Dr. Strecker refers to in the Memorandum. It is a frightening realization that the government I once held dear and hopeful for, has chosen a chilling Dark Path under the guise of ""national security"" and a ""War on Terror"", both of which are false.
Every adult should read and study this Memorandum and prepare themselves for the ongoing war on the people which has accelerated with development and deployment of Ebola and Marburg viruses. What the US Army tried to do with the AIDS virus, has been accomplished with these two ""new"" viruses - genetically modified RNA capable of devastating our world population.",1414540800,6,2155,5.005571030640668
