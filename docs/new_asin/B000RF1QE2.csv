2865784,5,B000RF1QE2,"A few months ago I found myself sick on a Sunday afternoon with a few hours to kill on the couch. Sadly, there was nothing good in our Tivo and Sunday television can be pretty abysmal. I decided to surf the internet a little and wound up on a link to the NBC website where you can watch full episodes of most of their top shows. I decided to just watch the Pilot of Friday Night Lights. I keep hearing it's pretty awesome and since I liked the movie, and I like Kyle Chandler, I gave it a shot.

Cut to seven episodes later at two in the morning, eyes swollen from crying as I'm forcing myself to shut the computer down even though all I can think about is that I have to get through the other eleven before Wednesday.

I am going to make a bold statement here, I think this is the best show on network television. In the space of seven episodes I became hopelessly attached to Coach Taylor, his family, and his players. I watched the next 11 in record time and by the end of the season, I was practically ready to move to Texas.

The story centers around Coach Eric Taylor in his first season as Head Coach in the ""football is everything"" fictional small town of Dillon, Texas. His wife Tami is a guidance counselor at the school and his daughter Julie is a sophomore. The Taylors have the kind of marriage I daydream about. There is a scene where Coach is watching game tape in his office really late one night and Tami shows up with food and beer. She looks at his tired face and says, ""the field's empty, wanna go make out?"" There is a playful sexiness to this obviously well lived in relationship that thrills me to the tips of my hopeless romantic toes. They've been at this for years but it still seems fresh and alive. They definitely argue and disagree but it's the kind of confident fighting you can do when you know the other person isn't going anywhere. And they both have good relationships with their daughter. I like it when TV admits it's OK to like your parents.

And there is the football team. Instead of a parade of stereotypes, we have a bunch of high school boys who seem like real high school boys. Some of them are that teenage boy combination of overly cocky but really insecure, some are just legitimately cocky. The sophomore that gets pushed into the starting QB role when the senior gets injured has a crush on the Coach's daughter and it takes him almost six episodes to work up the nerve to say more than about two words to her. She's smart and a little bookish and he awkwardly drops it into a conversation that he likes Jackson Pollack-apparently trying to show her he's not just some dumb football player. She lightly calls him out for the strange reference but she's clearly delighted that he's trying so hard. Maybe I love their interactions so much because I was one of those smart girls in high school and boy attention was few and far between enough that those moments always felt like out of body experiences for me. I can still get butterflies thinking about the look on a boy's face when he's doing a terrible job of impressing you but the very act of trying is melting your heart.

The Coach loves football and he's out for the State Championship the town is fervently expecting, but from day one-it's these boys he loves more. Head Coach in a small Texas town isn't a job, it's a lifestyle. And because he ends up being a father figure to half the team, he has a scene with a kid in every single episode where I end up in tears, wishing somehow I could get on his team. I don't know how his pep talks manage to sound so sincere and inspiring when they could so easily up as empty cliches but I credit Kyle Chandler with inhabiting his character so completely that you believe he believes every word he says. Whether it's the injured QB who will never play again or the whole team after a hard fought win, he has the right simple words that you just really want to believe.

Anyway, what I really want to say is that this show is tightly written, beautifully shot, tremendously acted, and uses it's fabulous soundtrack to complement-not manipulate-the stories. It's not one bit preachy but there is a definite sense of right and wrong that has really resonated with me. It's careful to make the character three-dimensional enough though that you are just as quick to forgive them as you are to condemn some of their dumb decisions.

Please watch it. I'm a little embarrassed for all of us that Grey's Anatomy-which I fully admit to watching-and all it's melodrama and morally bankrupt storylines won the Emmy for Best Drama when this little bit of perfection was quietly strangled by it's time slot against American Idol. Buy it buy it!",1184716800,14,4679,4.427409988385598
2865785,5,B000RF1QE2,"The first time my husband and I watched this show, we kept having to pause our Tivo to stare at each other and ask: ""Is it just me, or is this show SHOCKINGLY, AMAZINGLY WONDERFUL???"" We couldn't believe that a show this good was on television.

I'm a TV buff, to be sure, but my first choice of entertainment is books. I read the H.G. Bissinger book on which this series (and the Billy Bob Thornton film) are based. The book is one of my all-time favorites, right up there with the work of Tracy Kidder. And I ***hate*** football. (If you're skeptical about all this, I'll just go ahead and say it, simply because I want to reiterate what everyone else says -- ""Yes, this is show about football. But it's NOT ABOUT FOOTBALL."") Because I loved the book so much, I stayed far away from the film. I still have never seen it. But I learned soon after the TV series debuted that one of its most luminous actors, Connie Britton (who plays Coach Taylor's wife) plays the same role in the film. Now I **need** to see the film.",1184716800,8,1019,4.307291666666667
2865786,5,B000RF1QE2,"Family rifts, pigskin action, small town conflicts, and intriguing teen soap plotlines - on the level of the best teen soaps like ""Dawson's Creek"" - dominate NBC's sterling new series ""Friday Night Lights"".  To borrow a phrase from TV Guide, it's the best show you're not watching.

 Puzzlingly, the show manages to attract a mere seven million viewers each week.  Given the success of football-themed theatricals at the box office - most of them lesser creative enterprises - this series should have been a slam dunk.  Or a touchdown...  Or whatever.  The show is even based on a popular movie of the same name.  If only things were so easy to predict in television.

 Fortunately for viewers, cooler, more patient heads are prevailing at NBC these days, which has extended the show's order to a full season of 22 episodes.

 True, some people are made dizzy by the show's signature shaky camera work, but the effect generally enhances the show's allure.

 Kyle Chandler is turning in one of the most disarming performances in all of television as Coach Eric Taylor.  As head of the Panthers, he is ultimately responsible for an entire town's reason for being; the identity the small community of Dillon, Texas, rides on this one man's shoulders.  It seems no matter which way he turns, someone is nattering at him, offering unsolicited advice.  Whether dealing with his family, the players or the townsfolk, Chandler is the show's true heavy, and he makes it easy to buy the coach's unmatched leadership and unfettered morality.  That skill makes Connie Britton's ability to keep up as the his wife and the school's guidance counselor all the more impressive.  Their conversations, even when they're bickering, are one of the show's most amusing pleasures.

 After much contemplation (not to mention much viewer anticipation), their teenage daughter Julie (Aimee Teegarden) finally agreed to go on a date with newly minted quarterback Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford).  Saracen is of course not your typical football player.  A backup quarterback thrust into the spotlight when the star of the team has a paralyzing mishap on the field, Saracen is sensitive and a little bit bumbling, but in a completely charming way - conveniently making it absolutely impossible not to root for him.

 There are other dramas and many more characters to follow, running the gammut from the player whose life was changed by that tragic football injury to another who is an alcoholic involved in a traitorous love triangle, from a dimentia-afflicted grandma to a dad at war in Iraq.  In recent episodes, the pressure on high school athletes to bulk-up through the use of steroids has been addressed in painful sequences, and one story strand featured an unemployed, washed up former football star desperately seeking a job.

 ""Friday Night Lights"" handles all of these issues painfully, heartbreakingly well.  The series may occasionally be hard to watch, but it offers a uniquely satisfying weekly glimpse of small town life.  It's not even a contest.  ""Friday Night Lights"" is a winner.

2865787,5,B000RF1QE2,"I didn't even consider watching this show at the beginning of the 06/07 season. It was a show about football, enough said.

Then it was critically acclaimed and low-rated, which I find is a sign of great television, so I gave it a chance. I didn't love it immediately--it took me a couple of episodes to get into it--but by the time I loved it, I really loved it. I was so glad that NBC had posted aired episodes on-line so I was able to catch up.

It is well-acted. beautifully shot, and emotionally engaging. And the price of this set is unbeatable. I look forward to sharing it with friends, hoping against hope that for once there will be a ratings turnaround in favor of quality television.",1183766400,55,695,4.421875
2865788,5,B000RF1QE2,"And I mean like a tremendous book.

Like when you were a kid and you sat on your favorite couch under the stairs, stack of Oreos and a glass of milk at your side, and devoured the next ""Black Stallion"" book by Walter Farley. Or the next Spiderman/Thor/Fantastic Four (pick one) comic. Or, as you got older, the next ""Horatio Hornblower"" adventure or the next ""Lord of the Rings"" saga or the next ""Harry Potter"" drama.

Watching ""Friday Night Lights"" (the TV Series) is just like spending time with a beloved book.

You can't wait to find out what happens to the characters next. You can't believe what terrible thing happens next. You can't believe what awesomely wonderful thing happens next.

You don't know that time is passing. You're in that best summer-like ""unscheduled time"" mode -- totally immersed in a world. You are transported by the atmospheric music of ""Explosions in the Sky"" and the scary-big skies of Texas and the small-town kindnesses and the quirkily sweet citizens.

And it's like a book because you really do need to watch it from the beginning. Unless you're a wacko, you wouldn't start a beloved book from the last chapter, now would you?

I just stumbled across the show's first episode because I heard Kyle Chandler was in it and that Peter Berg produced it. I was totally unprepared for the 21 hours that came next. Something entirely fresh. Entirely different. Entirely unforgettable.

I haven't advocated so hard for a show to be watched or renewed since ""Firefly."" Those of you who watched that show's 14 hours will know what I mean. It was all about the cast. All about the family. All about the human connections and the little moments between people -- the laughter around the galley table, the orange knit hat with the pom-pom on top, the shared fear and hope and pain.

You'll see what I mean when you start watching ""Friday Night Lights.""  This series didn't win a Peabody Award for nothing.

First, you gotta buy the DVD. No sweat, right? All together now - ""clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose!""",1183680000,15,2034,4.704225352112676
2865789,5,B000RF1QE2,"HELP SAVE THIS SERIES! February 8, 2008 -- There is an extremely good chance that this evening's season finale (the decision not to make any more episodes for Season Two has apparently already been made) could be the last episode of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS forever.  Unless fans get involved.  There are things we can do to save this, which is still one of the two best series on network television (I have to include PUSHING DAISIES on the best of the best list -- the other greatest shows on TV are on cable, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, THE WIRE, and MAD MEN).  Here on Amazon you can do either of two things.  One, you can watch individual episodes of the show on Unbox.  Two, you can buy Season One on DVD.  Hey, it's only $18.99!  That is the cost of a large pizza with three toppings!  The other thing you can do is to go to any online FNL websites (either the official board on [...] or just about anywhere else -- Google it -- and find out about letter writing campaigns.  Fans last year saved what is quite frankly a pretty average show, JERICHO, from cancellation.  Surely the same can be done of one the most brilliant shows on TV.  Although NBC president Ben Silverman seems intent on cancelling the show, there is a legitimate chance that it could reappear on another network (come on CW!  it would instantly be your best show by a gigantic margin!).  I'll revise this as developments occur.

Warning!  Some spoilers are contained in the following review.

So many of my favorite shows seem afflicted with names that make nonviewers dismiss them without actually watching them.  Based on the name alone or the most superficial knowledge of the show, they feel they known enough to ignore them.  I've had a tremendous time convincing people that BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is not only not silly, but one of the most intelligent shows in the history of television.  Likewise, I've struggled telling people who I know love quality television that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA has nothing in common with the old Lorne Greene/Dirk Benedict cheesefest and instead is a television masterpiece that even someone who hates Sci-fi would love.  And so now I have, largely without success, tried my hardest to get my TV-savvy friends to grasp a very simple fact:  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS really isn't about football.  Yes, there is some football in it, but like BUFFY and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, this is a television series that utterly defies expectations.  All three shows are more about people and the decisions they make.  The vampires, the space ships, and the football are just window dressing.

With the possible exception of LOST (which is fully back on track after a shaky Season Three start), FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is the best series on network television (though I would add that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and THE WIRE are at least as good, but BSG is on the Sci-fi Channel and THE WIRE on HBO).  It came terribly close to being cancelled due to absolutely horrible ratings but managed to survive for a very simple reason:  it is a stunningly great show.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS represents television at its finest, a show as good as the very best that TV has produced in the past decade.  It belongs alongside BUFFY, THE SOPRANOS, THE WEST WING, SIX FEET UNDER, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, and other shows of that quality.  There were other very good shows to debut in 2006-2007 such as UGLY BETTY, HEROES, DEXTER, and MEN IN TREES, but FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is easily the best of those shows.  It received critical acclaim and accolades unusual for a network series with such dismal ratings and perhaps its lone chance of survival past Season Two lies in its performance at the Emmys.  I could be wrong, but my gut tells me that this could be one of those shows that finally wins an audience by the awards it will win.  I think there is an extremely good chance that FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS will win the Emmy for Best Dramatic Series and that perhaps two or three acting awards will be picked up by its actors.  I would lay even money that Kyle Chandler will win Best Actor in a Dramatic Series while Connie Britton will certainly receive a Best Actress nomination and deserves to win.  On the supporting actor and actress side, I wouldn't be surprised if three or four additional performers received nominations, especially Zach Gilford for his portrayal of sophomore quarterback Matt Saracen, Adrianne Palicki as sometimes bad girl Tyra Collette, and Minka Kelly for her remarkable, nuanced, and compelling job as Lyla Garrity.  And to be fair, there are three or four others who should receive consideration.  This is simply the most talented cast on television.  There are many, many reasons to watch this show and the quality of the acting is one of those reasons.

If you have not seen FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS repeat the following mantra over and over until you come to believe it:  ""This show is not about football.  This show is not about football.  This show is not about football.""  To be honest, if this show was about football I wouldn't watch it.  It is about people struggling to live their lives.  Take Matt Saracen.  As the sophomore backup to the team's star quarterback he didn't go into the season to play much if at all.  But after Jason Street, the team's greatest star, goes down with a crippling injury, he has to assume a job he is not prepared to take on.  Meanwhile, he has to continue to care for his grandmother who is suffering from mild dementia and requires a great deal of care.  His father, who is serving in the army in Iraq, is able to provide little direct assistance.  And if his life isn't complicated enough, he is deeply attracted to the coach's daughter Julie (with yet another marvelous acting job handed in by Aimee Teegarden).  Meanwhile, Matt struggles to keep friendships alive as he finds football success, which creates tensions with his musically astute Christian nerd friend (and member of a Christian hardcore rock band).  Yet another mark of the show's brilliance is that Landry Clarke, his friend, is not presented as in any way a simplistic character (and again, he is wonderfully played by Jesse Plemons).  He isn't one of your stock nerds nor is he in any way a stereotyped Christian.  He is literate, intelligent, socially awkward, and a really caring, compassionate friend.  His awkward attempted courtship of the party girl Tyra is one of many wonderful wrinkles in the season.

There are so many things to praise about this show that one could almost not come to an end.  But clearly at the heart of the show is the Taylor family.  I find this the most believable and compelling television family that I have ever seen.  Coach Taylor is not a perfect person, but he is a wise one, fully capable of admitting his mistakes.  His wife Tami (I did mention how extraordinary Connie Britton is in this role, didn't I?) is fully his equal on every level.  She is smart, insightful, empathetic, caring, and implacable.  With their daughter Julie they form a family that feels so real that at times you truly don't feel that you are watching actors performing but magically eavesdropping on a real life family.  There are many scenes between Coach Taylor, his wife, and Julie that left me agog and asking myself, ""Was that really acting?""

Another pole around which the show is constructed concerns attempt of Jason Street and his girlfriend Lyla to come to terms with his serious spinal injury, which leaves him without the use of his legs.  If there is one bit of unreality to the show it is the speed with which Jason adjusts to having suffered such a serious injury.  I understand why they did this.  It would have been tedious to stretch Jason's adjusting to being a paraplegic over a couple of seasons.  Instead, they took a process that should have taken over a year and shrank it for dramatic purposes to two or three months.  But the emotions and dilemmas that his injury creates for both Jason and Lyla make wonderful television.

I simply don't have room to mention all the wonderful characters on the show.  Even mentioning only briefly characters like Lyla's father (and president of the booster club), Jason's best friend Tim Riggins, star running back Brian 'Smash' Williams,  or the minister's intelligent but bipolar daughter Noannie Williams doesn't do justice to all the wonderful performers on this show.

Nor do I have time to do justice to how intelligently this show is written.  Even though it takes up themes that a host of other shows have dealt with, it always manages to do so freshly and innovatively.  The finest example is the episode that deals with the fallout from some crudely racist remarks made by an assistant coach.  The controversy builds to the point where it appears that all the black players will quit the team unless the coach is fired.  I won't spoil the resolution, but the episode ends with one of my favorite moments in the entire 2006-2007 season.

If there are two series currently running that I could make anyone and everyone watch, simply because they are so extraordinarily good, they are FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  There are so many similarities between the two shows.  Both have huge and talented ensemble casts.  Both are brilliantly written.  Both are filmed using handheld cameras and have a gritty, documentary feel to them.  And both defy all the expectations people have formed in thinking that they don't want to see them.  Both these series represent television at its very best.  Please do both yourself and this show a favor:  watch it.

In closing, I have to point out that one of the problems the show had in its first season was that no one knew when it was on.  The problem is the title.  NBC didn't want to put it on Fridays because that night is considered the kiss of death.  But the fact is that it is probably the only night they could ever schedule it.  No matter what they do everyone is going to assume it broadcasts on a Friday.  So, NBC surrendered to the inevitable and placed it on their Friday schedule.  Tune in and watch it!  And kudos to NBC!  Without any serious competition NBC has emerged as the leading purveyor of quality entertainment on television.  The irony is that they rank fourth in viewership.  CBS, with absolutely no critically acclaimed shows, ranks first.  With other networks willing to pull the plug on a show regardless of their critical acclaim (such as the CW killing their only critically acclaimed series, VERONICA MARS), I tremendously admire NBC for sticking with this and other excellent shows that may not get the greatest ratings.  Let's just all pray that the outstanding series gets the viewership it so richly deserves.

NBC Universal seems to be doing their part to increase the popularity of the series.  Many series retail for as much as $89.99 before discounting down to a lower figure, while the standard retail price for most series is around $59.95.  But they are offering FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS initially at $29.99 and only $19.99 after Amazon's discount.  No other show that I have ever heard of starts off at a price this low.  It truly is unprecedented.  To my mind they are making us an offer that we can't refuse.",1183680000,164,11175,4.721447028423772
2865790,5,B000RF1QE2,"I was (am) a huge fan of the movie ""Friday Night Lights,"" which I found to be incredibly well-acted and almost totally heartbreaking in its depiction of how important high school football is to at least some parts of Texas.  I'd rank it not only as one of the best sports movies ever made, but as one of the best movies of ANY kind of the decade thus far.

Those are big shoes for a television series to try and fill, but I have to say, this one is getting the job done pretty well.

The pilot episode is far and away the weakest of the entire season, and it had me more than little worried that the series was going to tank right off the bat.  It's not a bad episode -- just a little flat and uninspired (surprising, considering that it and the movie shared the same director, Peter Berg).

Things began to improve very quickly with the second episode, however, and the series seemed literally to get better every episode, right through to the end of the season.

The entire cast is terrific, but I think special mention needs to be made for the closest thing the show has to leads: Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton.  Both are terrific actors who are past due for real stardom, and if there were any justice, this show would do it for them.  They are utterly convincing in their roles as the team's coach and the school's guidance counselor.  Oh yeah, and they're married.  Together, their portrayal of a married couple is quite possibly the best, most convincing and illuminating, and most all-around affecting filmed relationship that I have ever seen on television.  You'd swear at some points that you were watching a documentary -- and a really good one, at that.

This is, quite simply, one of the best shows on television, on every level: the writing, the acting, the directing, the lighting, the music, EVERYTHING about this show is top-notch.  It's a family show, but not in the sappy sense; it's a sports show, but one in which the emphasis is on the people involved in the sport, NOT on the sport itself; it's a drama, but one that will frequently make you laugh.

If you consider yourself to be interested in great television -- anything from ""The Wire"" to ""Battlestar Galactica"" to ""Arrested Development"" to ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" to ""Hill Street Blues"" -- then you owe it to yourself to check this one out.

And if you haven't seen the movie, it's well worth seeing, too.",1183593600,69,2390,4.525581395348837

It's about relationships, raising children, community spirit, small town life especially in Texas with it's unique flavor and, of course, football. There's a great deal of focus on building teenagers' character: their values, commitment, respect for others, honesty, and confidence. If you are a parent, teacher or coach you will like this show. If you're a football fan, you will like this show. It's not essential to love football to watch this show, as there is plenty of focus on relationships, family life, and goings on in the community. There is an emphasis on the positive, or creating positivity. The acting is really superb; it's very natural; the interactions of husbands and wives, children and their friends, coaching staff and athletes all seem so natural, as if you're there and they are living out their real lives.",1447632000,9,925,4.974193548387097

2865865,5,B000RF1QE2,"I never saw this series when it was on TV.  I just thought it was about football and that I would never be interested.  But recently I started streaming, and for some reason decided to watch an episode or two.
I feel I just emerged from a coma after watching all 5 seasons in a binge watching session you wouldn't believe.  I stayed up late; I got up early; I didn't watch anything else on TV.
I lived in Texas for a few years, so I know all about high school football in Texas.  My daughter was one of those flag waving girls cheering for the team, so I went to every game.  I didn't pay much attention to the game and everyone I knew thought that was strange.  The whole town LOVED football, and we didn't  even have a very good team.
The characters in this show are so real, I feel as if I have stepped back in time and am still living in Texas.  The kids are real, the adults are real.  I love Kyle Chandler, who plays the head coach, Eric Taylor.  Coach Taylor and his wife have the best marriage ever portrayed on TV, or in the movies.  They are very happily married, although they still  have disagreements.  Their marriage is so realistic, it seems as if I know the couple.  Their daughter, Julie, and the other ""teens"" are just like typical teens everywhere, but especially in Texas.  But these are mostly good teens, who still drink alcohol, and have sex, just as all good teens do.  No one seems to spend much time in school, although they always show up for football practice, even if they have a hangover.  And some of the teens seem to have no adult who looks after them.  Tim Riggins lives with his brother and the two drink beer all the time.  Matt Sorenson live with his grandmother, who suffers from dementia (although the mildest case I have ever seen), so he takes care of her.  Tyra lives with her single mother, and her older sister, a stripper.  The mother doesn't seem to care what the girls do, or who they bring home to sleep with them. Lyla Garrity is a spoiled rich girl, who has everything she could want, until her boyfriend becomes paralyzed after an injury in a game.  Their plans of going to the same college (whichever one from which he accepts a scholarship), him playing pro football, and marriage and a family are all dashed in an instant.
The final season of this show ties up all the loose ends.  Yet I felt so sad when it was over.  Like I lost a friend.  I will probably watch it again, although not as fast this time.
I purchased the first season and had it sent to my aunt.  She doesn't think she will like it - because it is about football.  I hope she actually watches it so she will find out it isn't really about football.
But I did learn a little about football by watching this.  I may actually watch a game on TV sometime.",1429660800,5,2772,4.258620689655173

Unfortunately, it's no longer offered on Amazon Prime.

2865941,5,B000RF1QE2,"A truly great series.  Wish it had less focus on teenagers taking their clothes off.  The core of the series is the story of Coach and Mrs. Coach, and their life together, but there's a bevy of fine young actors that blend together quite well",1404518400,,242,4.355555555555555

2865950,5,B000RF1QE2,I just finished Season 1 and love it! I live in a large Texas city and think the show feels so real. The characters and their stories pull you in and it's hard not to love every one of them.,1402531200,,190,3.775

2865952,4,B000RF1QE2,"If not for a few things I would give this 5 stars. Some things were expected, the sullen athlete blaming himself with no reason for his friends injury. Hostile locals after one loss by the new coach. All in all though this is probably as fine as television gets, a thoughtful look at southern football at the high school level. The local fandoms craziness, the push to win, character building and also tragic injury. One thing I feel is lacking is the church aspect of this and the locals religion. But Hollywood could never get that right as none of them believe anyway.",1401408000,,571,4.553398058252427
2865953,5,B000RF1QE2,Just loved this series.  It's not a typical teenager show.  It's for all ages.  Very good and I highly recommend spending your time watching it.,1401321600,,144,4.68
2865954,5,B000RF1QE2,"One of the best series network TV has ever done. The writing, the acting, and the production values all rate 5 stars. Not to mention Connie Britton, Aimee Teegarden, Adrienne Palicki, and Minka Kelly. All beautiful and all supremely talented.",1401148800,,242,5.075

2865957,4,B000RF1QE2,"The series showcases the decisions that both the coach, players, and their families make (both good, but some poor choices) and the outcomes from those decisions.  There are couple of key relationships such as the coach and his wife, and the QB and his girlfriend that are quite compelling to follow.  The season follows the Dillion's teams ups and downs on their quest to win football in a small Texas town that is completely centered around the team.",1400630400,,452,4.782051282051282

2865962,5,B000RF1QE2,"I did not ""discover"" Friday Night Lights until its last two seasons, so I am thrilled to be able to start over from the very first episode and understand all the plot intricacies and back stories.  This series has story lines for people of all ages, masterfully interwoven to explore cross-generational impacts. On top of that, it incorporates traditional family and community values (including the importance of religion in people's lives and attendant hypocracy) while also depicting the values and mores of the younger generations.  By the way, football is merely the glue holding all of the story lines together, and people who are not football fans should still be mesmerized by this fascinating series.",1399680000,,708,5.147826086956521
2865963,5,B000RF1QE2,Enjoyable story hard to stop watching the episodes one after the other. Believable story with real life problems and refreshing solutions.,1399680000,,138,5.619047619047619

2865965,5,B000RF1QE2,"I watched the full movie version first and liked it so I bought the first season just because. Started watching and before I knew it,
I now own all 5 seasons of the series and was very disappointed when I found out that was it. I loved the show.",1399420800,,245,4.020408163265306
2865966,4,B000RF1QE2,"I began watching Friday Night Lights after watching all five seasons of Parenthood.  Friday NIght Lights is a very good show, but I really liked Parenthood better.  I am in my late forties, and I think I could just relate to more of the characters on Parenthood.  High school is a long way behind me.  But I would have loved Friday Night Lights when I was a teenager.  It is a good show.  I enjoy watching it and absolutely give it four stars.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was just that there are other shows I like a little better just because I can relate to other shows a little better, such as Parenthood and The Good Wife, which I also love.  So I would recommend that anyone give Friday Night Lights a try.  If you like Parenthood, Friday Night Lights is made by Jason Katims who is a big part of Parenthood.  So give it a try and see what you think.",1399420800,,872,4.167664670658683
2865967,5,B000RF1QE2,"Started watching Series One and it is so good, I have to allot myself only 2 to 3 episodes each time, if I could I would sit and watch ALL of this until it was all done.  I guess I particularly enjoy it as I was a Sophomore in High School, and actually traveled to Odessa and watched our team play them, it was not pretty.  These guys were all the movie said and then some.  If you love Texas Football, or just Football in general I highly recommend this Series, Great High school Football, with some American Graffiti thrown in.",1399334400,2,529,4.217821782178218

Love the characters and storyline!

HIghly recommend......",1399334400,,172,4.7
2865969,5,B000RF1QE2,"Friday Night Lights is, in some ways, a study of the human spirit and a paean to hard work.  It is moral, but not moralistic. It is a drama, yet sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.  It is complex and, ultimately, uplifting.  Don't get me wrong; I'm a fan of both the intellectual AND the weird and twisted.  This series is neither. What it is, is both wholesome and compelling.",1399248000,,373,4.522388059701493
2865970,5,B000RF1QE2,"The cast, the storylines, everything about this series, all 5 seasons, were fantastic. I would recommend this to everyone, even non sports fans, there's a story for everyone to relate to in one way or another.

2865972,5,B000RF1QE2,"Probably the best family drama ever on television. Acting is amazing, characters all believable, situations/ character choices are foolish at times but you understand the motivations.  This is TV at its best.",1399075200,,208,5.5
2865973,5,B000RF1QE2,Great drama that's not too corny. All the characters are really well fleshed out. Kyle chandler is amazing as the coach and so is connie britton as his wife is good too.,1398470400,,169,4.3125
2865974,4,B000RF1QE2,Great show! Make you realize all the pressure that teenagers and high school athletes go through. It brought back lots of high school memories.,1397952000,,143,5.0

2865976,5,B000RF1QE2,"One of the best TV series ever. It's so convenient watching it on Prime Instant Video since I missed it in its original run on TV. Warning: being able to watch each episode, one after another...no commercials, is highly addictive. Don't plan on getting much else done for awhile. It's that good. I might even watch a real football game sometime...think I've learned something 'bout the game now.",1397520000,,395,4.823529411764706

2865982,5,B000RF1QE2,"It is a rare thing to have a show that can appeal to anyone, including those who are not football lovers. All the character are well defined and believable.

2865984,5,B000RF1QE2,This show is truly one of the best I've ever seen. I recently gave myself a marathon of watching Season 1. I had forgotten how much this show moves me! Writing and acting are superb - highly recommended.,1396396800,,203,4.368421052631579
2865985,5,B000RF1QE2,Best 1 season of a show I've ever seen! Coach and Tammy are my favorite couple ever. I wish Dillion were a real place I could visit.,1396396800,,132,3.925925925925926
2865986,2,B000RF1QE2,"As a former teacher, I find it hard to believe that football players would be allowed to remain on the team after publicly drinking.  This sends the wrong message to young people today.  I also didn't like all the sex scenes in this.  I am not stupid, I know that sex in
teens is common, but come on, is it necessary for a show about high school football?  I can see why this show died.  Unfortunately, the premise was good.  I know that in some parts of the country high school sports rule.  This had too many predictable plots: the injured star quarterback, the player from the ""wrong side of the tracks who is an alcoholic, father, a loser golfer, the new quarterback whose father is away in the Army and he is left with a grandmother who has dementia, etc etc etc etc.  Every episode has some stupid twist written for a middle school mind.  The good part was the football scenes.",1396396800,,883,4.368098159509202

2865989,5,B000RF1QE2,"Friday Night Lights is simply of the best series ever put on television! You find yourself caring for the characters, and rooting for the team, and crying with a team when things don't go well or there is tragedy. the end of the series was a huge loss for television.

2865990,5,B000RF1QE2,"My wife and I are enjoying this a lot.  Nice to see a show that doesn't go over the top with regards to sex or violence and that illustrates that there are consequences (both good and bad) depending on the choices we make, and also that sometime things happen that we can't control but must learn to deal with.  This show has a good mix of joys, disappointments, humor, and sadness that is much more realistic and thus much more relate-able  than what one typically sees on tv.  I only wish there were more shows that could emulate this.  That is, we don't always need entertainment that seeks first to excites the senses, but rather gives us something about the real-life human experience.",1395878400,,690,4.5772357723577235

2865994,5,B000RF1QE2,"We love watching it as a family. I have 3 boys who love football and a husband who coaches.  Love the characters. We use a lot of the situations to teach our kids lessons about integrity, morality, and hard work.",1395705600,,212,4.3
2865995,4,B000RF1QE2,"Drama. So. Much. Drama. Friday Night Lights does a great job of drawing you in with character development and multiple story lines.  It reminds me a lot of 24 in this regard. The acting at times can get spotty and/or cheesy, but that's some times hard to discern from high school behavior anyways so at the end of the day that didn't really bother me. Great show, check it out!",1395705600,,377,4.385714285714286

2865998,5,B000RF1QE2,I found the series through my amazon prime membership and got hooked.  I watched all 5 seasons and still go back and watch episodes.  I liked the issues dealt with and the characters portrayed.  Many things reminded me of growing up near a small Iowa town.,1395100800,,256,4.521739130434782
2865999,5,B000RF1QE2,"Of course, I'd read the reviews and heard the raves from other people about this show, but I always thought, ""Eh, high school football.  In Texas.""  Lord, how wrong I was to doubt.  I binge watched this first season.  Hard.  I became immediately invested in almost all the characters -- even the ones who seemed annoying at first.  I LOVE Connie Britton and I LOVE LOVE Kyle Chandler so it had that going for it already, but the story and the acting and the directing (though I will say, I was initially a little nervous that the construct of the first couple episodes was going to last through the entire series; fortunately, that was not the case) all work together to create a show that is, in a word, outstanding.  I don't know how this show EVER almost got cancelled due to lack of interest -- then again, there may have been a lot of folks like me who didn't understand that it was definitely more than just a story about high school football in Texas.  I related to every single character at one point of their arc or another which just made me invest in the entire story even more.  I implore you if you ever thought you might want to watch, but don't want to make the commitment of ""catching up"" with all the seasons, do it.  Do it now.  Well, at least the first season.  I can't really speak to the rest of them ... yet.",1395014400,,1330,4.2971887550200805

2866009,5,B000RF1QE2,"Took me a while to actually start watching this, but I absolutely love it,  I've lost a lot of sleep watching episode after episode.  It's good clean TV with a message.  Funny how they show teenager's drinking all the time, but that's what teenagers do, right!  Hard to explain that to my kids, though.  I'm just starting season 2, and am so glad there are 5 seasons to watch!",1394064000,,376,4.391304347826087

2866012,5,B000RF1QE2,"It's the people that make this show good. They face problems where there isn't a right and wrong choice, and while you do have characters that you root for, there is no pure good guy or pure bad guy. They are real people",1393632000,,220,4.1395348837209305
2866013,5,B000RF1QE2,"This show has excellent acting, believable characters, and accurately portrays life in small-townTexas. Parallel story lines follow both the teenagers navigating high school society, with football reigning supreme, and their parents, for whom football also often gives their lives meaning and direction.

We totally indulged in this series & binge-watched to our hearts content (and our eyes' discomfort)! If you've never seen it, then give it a try. I loved the movie, so I don't know why I never gave the series the time of day...Love my Prime Membership & the fact that they have five seasons worth of FNL!",1393372800,,458,4.275862068965517

2866022,5,B000RF1QE2,One of those series you wished would never end. Character development is done so well that you think these are people you know. Gives you a real feel for what football means to Texas and what they will do to keep it that way. Awesome show! Miss it terribly.,1392940800,,257,4.26530612244898

I find it very inspiring and heartwarming.",1392595200,,366,5.258620689655173
2866027,5,B000RF1QE2,"Just finished season 1. Happy to find this gem of a series. I had caught a glimpse of Friday Night Lights off and on, but I expect it was on when another favorite was so I missed it on regular TV. It is a good mostly wholesome family series more about family and friends with some High School football and romance on the side. Very good acting and story lines with real life situations. I started season 2 last evening, looking forward to Coach returning to the home team.",1392508800,,472,4.314606741573034

2866034,5,B000RF1QE2,"Friday Night Lights is a  well written, and a wonderfully acted tv series that never got its just due.  Talented actors and many young stars combined to deliver a moving and exciting episode each week of the series.  Perhaps reality was stretched, but when is it not in the entertainment world?  Great watch would highly recommend!!",1392163200,,332,4.875

2866044,5,B000RF1QE2,"Very interesting series.  Always leaves you wanting more.  Acting is good, but at times it seems that incidents are odd and don't really match reality.  I guess Hollywood has to screw with even a good story???",1391472000,,209,4.75
2866045,5,B000RF1QE2,"I don't usually get involved with TV shows. I can count  on 1 hand the number of shows that I've watched on a regular basis in the past 5 years.  However, my husband started watching re-runs of Friday Night Lights on ESPN a couple of months ago and I started catching an episode here and there and I became hooked.  I was so happy to find the series on Prime.  This show is amazing.  Coach Taylor draws you right in with his epic speeches and insights in life.  The chemistry between Coach Taylor and Tammy is like no other.  The kids in the show are dynamic and deal with so many issues from paralysis to issues about sex.  I can't say enough about this show and I honestly don't even like football.",1391385600,,700,4.25

2866050,5,B000RF1QE2,"This is a great series that not only pertains to the demand and discipline of football but to family, friends and peer pressure.

2866061,4,B000RF1QE2,It's a very enjoyable series with all fantastic performances.  The football theme which it all centers around is a bit corny but once you start watching it's tough to quit.,1390867200,,172,4.733333333333333

Sure, it's a manpera (like a soap opera, but for men), but it is GOOD. So many little parts that are just so well acted. Plus if you played H.S. team sports, it's good to be reminded of how stupid we all were.

That's all, now go watch it.",1389916800,,427,3.896551724137931

I just finished rewatching season 1 , and it's staggering how they kept the quality so unbelievably high for 22 episodes. And not network tv great but any kind of tv.  This is just a gem of a show that has more beautifully wrought, quietly poignant moments than any other show.  Prepare to be emotionally swept up, big time.",1389398400,,585,4.5

2866091,5,B000RF1QE2,"This is my second go-around of watching all 5 seasons of Friday Night Lights.  I have recommeded this series to friends and family and always have received thanks for the excellent recommendation.
Friday Night Lights provides a wonderful snapshot of  the cultural, social, political, and economic life in a small Texas community, where highschool football provides the background for the story.  I particiularly like the ""moral compass"" that Coach Eric and his wife weave into the story, and the realistic stories of the students, families, and citizens of Dillon, Texas.  I grew up in a small town in Texas - much like Dillion. I am deliighted that in each episode, the cast, film crew, writers and director have captured the spirit and essence of real-life in similar communities across America.  Bravo and Yahoo!",1389139200,,815,5.097744360902255

2866093,5,B000RF1QE2,"I believe that Friday Night Lights is one of the best shows ever on TV. Whether you like football or not, it makes no difference. Its about people and life and struggles and triumph. From adolescent struggles to the challenges of marriage and family. A show that will truly make you laugh and cry. It is very well written, acted and directed. Peter Berg is one of the best in the business and hit an absolute grand slam with Friday Night Lights. Nothing is lacking, perfectly casted and written and carried out to perfection from A to Z. Would highly recommend to anyone. Each episode leaves you wanting the next.",1389139200,,613,4.581818181818182

2866096,5,B000RF1QE2,"Great series if you are jonesing for football.

2866112,5,B000RF1QE2,I loved this show and ended up watching all seasons. I knew nothing about football when I started watching but  it got me interested in the rules if the game. The actors made each character complex and interesting to follow and I think that it was easy to find someone on the show to relate to in terms of personal experiences. Great show!,1388707200,,339,4.380952380952381
2866113,5,B000RF1QE2,I started watching the series because I saw previous reviews. I can tell you that it was well worth my time to do so.

amazing cast. amazing direction. music, lighting, unreal. all of it. it almost seems like a documentary.

2866126,5,B000RF1QE2,"I wasn't a football fan before watching this series but can now say that I have a new understanding of the game. I highly recommend the entire Friday Night Lights series. It's well-written, well-acted and positively addictive. It has both the excitement of the game and all the intimate stories behind a small-town high-school football team, its coach and his family. Coach Taylor and his wife Tami are wonderful role models for educators, parents and neighbors, without being sappy or unreal. This is a realistic slice of small-town American life which doesn't shirk from difficult or unpleasant realities but manages to present a real core of decency and hope for the future. I was also very impressed that throughout the series (5 seasons), there is a solid consistency of style, story and direction. This is American story-telling and entertainment at its best.",1387843200,,865,5.098591549295775

Not too far away from what Texas towns are really like.  Full of sin, but also full of loyalty to the town & full of love for the Lord.",1387065600,,283,3.8275862068965516

I watched it because I liked the movie.

What a disappointment!",1386633600,,188,4.90625
2866140,4,B000RF1QE2,"This is a good show.  It's not great.  If you are, or ever were into filmmaking, you will find lots of continuity errors.  ""Extras"" looking into the cameras.  Moments of bad acting.  Props in the wrong place from scene-to-scene.  Scars missing, then re-appearing.  Pristine clean uniforms after a full football game, etc.  I understand this is not a movie and it's hard to get great extras but try to look the other away during the New York City scenes.  The background crowd is really into it and checking out the actors and the cameras.  I'm still in season 4 and it has not lost my interest as of yet but I can see where it's going.  I'm thinking that season 5 was a flop -- thus the discontinuation of the show.  But I'm not there yet.  If you've got nothing to do for several days, start with season 1 and keep moving until the end of season 5.  So far, it's taking me about a week to get to the middle of season 4.

The writing and acting are excellent, and it addresses issues of high school, small town life and parenting in a realistic way.  Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton are really enjoyable to watch as the main adult leads - their marriage feels very authentic, and as the football coach and the school guidance counselor, they deal with a lot of the students' issues firsthand.  There is drama, but it's not a soap opera.  Situations aren't drawn out.  People fight, people make mistakes, plans go awry, but then there's a resolution, or at least a decision, and life goes on.  You care about the characters, and even the unlikable ones are sympathetic at times.  I'm looking forward to following these people through the series.",1382918400,2,840,4.744827586206896

Kyle Chandler is killer as Coach Taylor, and, if like me, you've loved him since Homefront, you won't be disappointed.  This is a grown up show about high school kids straining against the oppressive culture of a small town whose only entertainment is football on a Friday night and the interpersonal drama that goes with it.  Watch the first episode and you'll be hooked immediately.",1382400000,2,507,4.538461538461538

The producers have filled-out the story in a way which, on the face of it, would not seem to have been worth more than 1 or 2 episodes by delving into real-life issues in a small town resonating with lessons for many today.",1381708800,,365,4.809523809523809

The actiing was excellent, writing and directing was tops, and after a short time you came to know the characters as if they were real and part of your family.  I have long felt that if art were any good it made you feel something, and this show made me feel something every week. Somewhere I read that the relationship between the coach and his wife was the best of it's type on TV.  It felt real to me.  I kept rooting for Matt Saracin because of the burden he carried for a high school boy taking care of a demented grand mother while trying to keep up his studies,  and play football. But my favorite character was Tim Riggins, the good/bad boy on the show. I was so happy you had all five seasons on Amazon and now I can relive the whole experience.

It had such a vein of goodness running through the struggles that I had a lump in my throat half the time. This is the kind of TV our kids should be watching.

2866218,5,B000RF1QE2,"Texas natives can tell you, there are few things in life that are more important than the bright lights that hover above high school stadiums, flickering with excitement and anticipation every Friday night during the fall semester.
High school football in the lone star state is a religion. Playbooks are Bibles. State rings are rosaries, clutched between the knuckles of past town hero's while prayers are sent up to some football deity on that fourth and goal from the one with five seconds to go.
People from there will tell you that it's more than a game. It's a way of life, of community, and congregation. Football in Texas is drama. You can go from triumph to overwhelming heartache and defeat in just a matter of seconds, in a single play or a single snap. And NBC's Friday Night Lights encapsulates this mindset, this way of life flawlessly.
Jason Katims loose adaptation of the original novel ""Friday Night Lights"" hits close to home for anyone who has grown up in a small town centered around a high school athletic team.  It's based in the fictional town of Dillon, Texas. Though Dillon doesn't actually exist, we do know that it's somewhere in west Texas, near Lubbock. It tells the story of the head coach, Eric Taylor and his wife Tami and the trials and tribulations that come with being the head coach in a football-obsessed town.
What sets Friday Night Lights apart isn't how it touches on a towns infatuation with a game, what sets this series apart is the characters. I dare you to watch Friday Night Lights and not fall in love with both Eric and Tami. Two people who, despite the towns all too often crazy antics, show more genuine care and appreciation for each other than you'll ever see between a couple, even a TV couple. They argue and disagree but they always come back to each other.
Friday Night Lights is the kind of show that makes you want to be a better person. The editing and the acting are so well done that after watching you feel like you're friends with these people. I felt like I was a resident in Dillon and every time I sat down to watch, I wondered what Eric or Tami or any of the residents or athletes would get into this week and how they would solve it.
 Friday Night Lights is about loss and heartache and heartbreak and trial and overcoming all of it. It's about taking what life throws at you and making the best of it. It's about understanding that things aren't always going to be easy, and that they hardly ever are but if you surround yourself with the right kind of people and attain the right mindset you can do anything.
This TV show gave that to me. How many shows can you say have done that? It's truly a remarkable series and if you haven't seen it you need to. It's about so much more than football.",1378252800,,2761,4.476190476190476
2866219,5,B000RF1QE2,"My son is a freshman and playing JV football. We started watching this show in the summer when he started practice. I had heard good things about this show and the realism of seeing how a championship team is made and wanted him to see what it took to be a good team member and player. He loves the show and it has help him realize that how ever hard his coaches are on him it is nothing like what they do in the show, and it helps him understand why the coaches are hard on them. It also helps him see that these guys make mistakes in their life and we talk about what the right thing to do is based on character and honor. We talk about making smart choices, we talk about honesty, clear communication to avoid misunderstandings. He now sees that football might be a way he could go to college and do something he loves. This show has been good for us to spur conversations and for a 14 year old boy, anything that can help him talk to his mama is a good thing.",1378252800,2,963,4.073684210526316

This is one of the finest shows ever made and certainly the best depiction of marriage I've ever seen captured on film. Like all great art, it inspired and moved me in ways I didn't anticipate. It made me appreciate what it means to be a parent, a spouse, a mentor, a friend, a family. How important it is to cherish and build hope in you community. And most importantly to never, ever give up.  In short, it's a handbook on how to be live and be loved. Highly recommended!",1377993600,2,596,4.418181818181818
2866222,5,B000RF1QE2,"After totally ignoring this series when it appeared in regular broadcast, I decided to watch the pilot. I sat in awe. The acting, the script and story line were excellent. I have almost finished the first season and I find myself drawn to the characters and wanting to know where they are going. Yes, there are the occasional trite jock flick lines, but they are few in number. And they are more then offset by the originality of the rest of the episode..

Overall, I would highly rate this series. I hope that seasons two through five are equally as well done.",1377907200,,561,4.5

2866230,5,B000RF1QE2,"And now I'm kicking myself because it was one of the best written, acted shows I've ever seen. I am not a huge fan of big network shows in general. They tend to be repetitive and boring. That said, this show was anything but (ok maybe a little repetitive with how they always seem to pull it out at the end of a game, but still not boring).

There is football, but that's really just a backdrop for the characters and their lives and interactions. Zach Gilford blew me away with his understated portrayal of Matt Saracen. Kyle Chandler as Coach Taylor was spot on. It reminded me very much of the football coach from my high school days. I ended up rooting as much for the team as the individuals. I literally got choked up more from this show than any other that I can remember, and that is a good thing. Not just tears of sadness but joy as well.

FNL might not be for everyone, but give it a try because you might be pleasantly surprised.",1377648000,,941,4.251396648044692

2866244,5,B000RF1QE2,"This series on Texas living has excellent writing that takes the snippet about Texas football that is depicted in the movie and elaborates on the stories of seemingly real people who actually live the unique lifestyle of Texas high school football. We were drawn in to the stories and characters because they were so genuine. Of course being a resident of Texas made it even that much more compelling, but anyone should be able to enjoy and crave the next episode because of the continuity that the producers of this series were able to maintain all the way to the end. Have no doubt that all of the characters and the things that happen to them surely exist in towns and cities throughout Texas...I see them all the time, The series explains the rabid passion for high school football being played at over-the-top facilities that exist all throughout Texas. Taking the story line right into the schools and homes of the participants was truly enjoyable.",1376956800,,954,4.787878787878788

I was impressed with the reality of day to day struggles and triumphs the story brought. This is quality all the way through . There's a person or more we all can relate to understand and like from young to older .
My hats off to all the cast the guild & people involved in this .. Thanks to you all ..
One of a kind , memorable with tons of class and character . Sad to see the last episode and have it all end but even with that the closure to most characters was appreciated .
If youve not seen this and think you can enjoy a quality show of day to day life revolving around an amaizing couple who has surrounded their life in small town atmosphere and  the upcoming of high schoolers growing up and of course the highs and lows of being very football minded . If at all you think its some thing for you then ENJOY .

2866257,5,B000RF1QE2,I wish the show was still on TV because of great acting and how High School football is portrayed which is very accurate. As an ex High School football coach there is too much pressure on coaches to win games instead of molding young men the values that however hard life gets you can overcome life's obstacles. The coach in this show does both and after watching all the episodes I am a diehard fan and would pay to see more episodes of this great show!,1376438400,,454,4.290697674418604

It's beautifully written, directed, edited and acted. It should have won multiple Emmys every season. See it for Taylor Kitsch's performances alone!",1373760000,,277,5.465116279069767
2866310,5,B000RF1QE2,"I don't have a TV so I didn't catch FNL when it aired (2006-2011).  And, frankly, neither organized sports nor the trials and tempests of rural Texas towns were subjects I deemed worthy of giving substance to. Especially football, with its inherent violence, thinly disguised misogyny, and the exalted place it lives in a popular culture that sanctifies, certifies, and ratifies bad behavior in boys. And even more especially, Texas, a state that seems to gloat over its proud heritage for being ground-zero in the manufacture and distribution of the above-mentioned qualities. I know. Harsh.

However, drawn to look at the show by all the good things I was hearing and seeing about Connie Britton, I launched head first into Season 1, episode 1.  I am happy to report that I shall now be forced to take a leave-of-absence from work in order to binge-watch all 5 seasons, 76 episodes in all, and catch myself up.

All the production elements (writing, scoring, photography, authentic locations, direction, and most importantly, PERFORMANCES) come together with considerable grace and elegance to tell the fictional story of life in the suburban Texas town of Dillon, revealed primarily through the framework of the community's near religious devotion to high school football.  In a seamless blending of constructed authenticity and faithful adherence to genuine emotions that tend toward believable actions, the sum of the show's constituent parts add up to an unexpected amount of insight and empathy for every individual in the Dillon community. Like many small American towns at the turn of the 21st century, Dillon's denizens find themselves caught between the allure of grinding up against the status quo or merely conforming to it.

Nevertheless, the show calls upon the viewer to neither fully reject nor wholeheartedly embrace any of the off-the-rack cultural value presented on the screen, because all social codes are conditional and fleeting. Rather, it asks the spectator to allow compassion for, and extend humanity to, all those who hold their own truths to be self-evident, regardless of where the  standards of others appear on the shifting scales of our own ethics or morality. No wonder this show had such passionate fans but low viewership.

There are very few shows I can compare this to. I resisted FNL, just as I resisted Nashville at first. I assumed both were just more examples from the bottomless well of drab TV soap-opera, depicting everyday life for a small group of self absorbed people, a cast of characters and a TV-narrative that could be thrown like a template over any location or fetish.  I will report back after I finish season 5, but I sense shows like these are serious mold-breakers.  In time, they may become the molds in need of breaking, but for right now, they are groundbreakers of the cathode ray for good storytelling.

Get on the bus!",1373414400,,2883,5.035714285714286
2866311,5,B000RF1QE2,"so good- watching it for the second time.  Was so disappointed with its low viewership when it was on TV- wonderful acting, great storyline.  The last season is soso- just because it gets away from its main characters.",1373414400,,218,4.7105263157894735

2866317,5,B000RF1QE2,I really had avoided watching this show because I thought it was going to be all about football and I am not a sports fan.  Well it reminds me of Titanic in that I thought that movie was going to be about the ship and that it sank. The movie was actually about the love between Jack Dawson and Rose and they just happened to be on the Titanic.  That is what Friday Night Lights is about. The relationships (all of which are interesting) simply take place in a town that takes their football very seriously!.  Love it!,1372982400,,517,4.255102040816326
2866318,5,B000RF1QE2,"This is an extremely well-written and  superbly acted series.  Actors Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton give outstanding performances as the couple at the center of it all,  high school football Coach Eric Taylor and his equally hard-working wife Tami (a high-school guidance counselor, when we first meet her).  On the surface,  the show is about the ups and downs of life in a small town where high school football is king.  But what impresses most is that with courage and sensitivity the show successfully takes on issues of class mobility,  racial conflict, changing gender ideals, and familiar tensions between the idea that it matters how you play the ""game of life"" and the too-tempting thought that winning is everything.

Yet this show doesn't preach and it doesn't provide easy resolutions to difficult life dilemmas.  What it does do is help you appreciate the richness and complexity of human experience,  even as it tells good stories with truly memorable characters.",1372982400,,980,5.1069182389937104

2866323,5,B000RF1QE2,Great series so far. Love the characters and a storyline that keeps me coming back for the next episode. The only thing I can say bad about Friday Night Lights is that I wish I would have started watching it a lot sooner!,1372723200,,221,4.162790697674419
2866324,5,B000RF1QE2,"Friday Night Lights is a great show, especially for football fans. The characters are well cast and well developed. The writing is sharp, the dialogue is realistic, and the story lines are interesting and well paced. It's a great show for families with older kids (12 and up) because it offers numerous opportunities for parents to discuss relavent issues with their kids. Can't believe we missed this when it was on the air, but glad we have had the chance to watch it as Amazon Prime members. I would highly recommend Friday Night Lights to anyone looking for quality television.",1372636800,,581,4.82
2866325,5,B000RF1QE2,"Enjoyed the stories very much.  Well played and directed.  I recommend it, but caution that the high school sex was a bit too much for me.  Doesn't anyone practice chastity anymore?",1372636800,,181,4.774193548387097

2866328,4,B000RF1QE2,"The show has good character development and well above-average cinematography.  In the later episodes, the producers and writers fell into the normal TV pattern of allowing the focus to shift to the drama of the relationships of the main characters and away from the gridiron, the drama inherent in the seasons of sports teams.  While not my cup of tea, the focus on high school angst is well done.",1372636800,,398,4.753623188405797
2866329,5,B000RF1QE2,"Somehow I missed this series when it was on tv.  I thought it was all about football and didn't want to watch it.  I like football okay, but not enough to watch a tv show about it.  My daughter insisted I give this another chance.  Since she lives in TX, I found this to be very entertaining!  The acting is excellent, great writing, great storylines.  The fact that it's actually filmed in a small TX town vs a studio lot in LA, makes a huge difference.  You can tell it's really TX, hard to duplicate that.  Yes, there's a lot of football in the series but it's all part of a wonderful storyline/series.  Great characters.

Ostensibly a portrayal of ""football as a religion"" in a west Texas town, it does present headshaking scenes that border on parody, but FNL actually is about love, family, character, and all those good things.  Very involving.  Don't miss it!",1372118400,,333,5.245283018867925

I am not a fan of that type of camera work where the camera is moving all over the place like the camera man forgot his tripod, so that gets on my nerves watching from time to time when the action gets slow.  Besides that, you will not want to stop watching it.",1371081600,,320,3.9076923076923076

2866355,5,B000RF1QE2,I choose to give this season five starts because of the quality of the streaming video.  The picture quality was great and came through with no problems.

This is NOT a sports show...it IS a story about the lives of people in a small Texas town where high school football is king. The wonderful cast of characters are what makes this show so wonderful. Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton as Coach Eric and Tami Taylor are just terrific in their roles. I wish all kids could have a teacher/coach/counselor like these two.

FYI - I've had no problems watching this on my Kindle Fire HD. Occasionally there is a lag when watching on my TV via my Roku but I'm sure this is due to the wireless, not Amazon. Amazon Prime and FNL are the best!",1370476800,,842,4.197530864197531

2866367,4,B000RF1QE2,This is one of the better acted shows I have seen in a long time.  It is not for younger kids unless you want to answer a lot of questions...these teenagers go through more adult oriented situations in one football season than I have experienced in 40 years.,1370390400,,258,4.375

The acting is first rate.  The foot ball sequences are exciting and held my attention - even though I have no interest in foot ball.  And I cared about the characters.

I was a little disappointed in the range of plot elements.  The series becomes predictable, especially in later seasons.  There were plot lines that were introduced, but then dropped - like the gay assistant coach, or the Mexican immigrant player - that could have opened things up.  Marketing, I'm sure.

But, at the end of the day, I binged through the all five seasons - so thumbs up!",1368921600,,727,4.714285714285714

and I thought I'd give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly it drew me into the characters and
the dilemmas/challenges they all face, and even the football scenes were absorbing and well done without being
too over the top about it. The characters seem very real, as are the issues they face. I especially like the arguments
the coach's family has, where they all talk/yell over each other and nothing gets solved. That reminded me a lot
of my family, and they usually realize things are out of control and come back to it later when they're calmer. The writers
are very talented at making all the side stories interesting, and keeping them all linked. I'm definitely a fan and am
already on Season 3, which is free with my new Amazon Prime. Love it!",1365897600,,879,4.46583850931677

So I watched the first one. Then the secondthirdfourthfifthand sixth in a row.

Two day's later I had seen the entire season.

By the way, the show is full of cute boys in the locker room (duh, why didn't I think of that?)  healthy, wonderful , male role-models with good looks and integrity and it shows prayer as natural and part of life- a given, a throw-away. I admired the subtly of that.

It's just full of heart, love and people who are committed to helping each other be the best they can be.

2866470,5,B000RF1QE2,"Friday Night Lights is much more then a high school football team sports drama.  Its about the state of Texas, about family life, about trust, about racism, about gays, about crime, about those with and without a family, and its about the College Sport Football Scholarship Machine that spits out and cuts the injured, even the slightly injured, and those not quite ready to make the college lineup.  Its about corruption and trust, and the good guys don't always win.

NBC attempted to correct its early marketing efforts that exclusively targeted a male high school student audience after the series first season by aggressively targeting teenage females, but the damage had been done, and females and others were turned off by the Friday Night Lights early weighty high school football marketing appeal.

If you are an East Coast Liberal you may be surprised to find yourself admiring Coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler the boss of the family) and his wife Tami Taylor (Connie Britton-who is really the boss of the family unbeknownst to husband Coach Taylor) and their conservative and probably very Republican Party outlook.

Its a sprinkling of you alls, and everything that goes along with a good deal of cleavage illustrating that everything is big in Texas, including football.  If you are an East Coast Liberal you may find yourself understanding your conservative counter part and what really makes him and her tick.  You will attend both black and white churches, and in a series of episodes see the effects of polar disorder on one teenager, and how it ends her boyfriend-girl friend relationship.

Values explored are not all black or white, but shades of gray, with subjects such as premarital teen sex, binge drinking, infidelity, black on white teenage dating, high school clicks, Rally Girls doing a football players homework, Alzheimers Disease, attempted suicide, and in one episode, a crooked American doctor practicing dangerous medicine in Mexico.  All of this is presented against a backdrop of poverty and high unemployment, as well as a schools real budget woes in a small rural town that lives only for football.

What happens to the left behinds, the teenager who is just out of the reformatory, the teenager who finds Jesus, the teenager who becomes a paraplegic, the teenager who is homeless, the teenager who is the only caretaker for his grandmother who has Alzheimers.  Its a hundred stories bundled into one and sometimes they throw in a little football, which really serves as a carry all for the rest of the themes.  Many episodes lack any football at all.

Im only into my third season and have to discipline my self to watch only one episode at a time. And I really don't like sports at all; my conclusion being that the real national sport is catching the players doing something illegal.  Unfortunately Sports are no longer about a player winning the game.  Friday Night Lights however is real.  Its well scripted, well acted, educational and very believable.

So listen up, its more then football.",1363219200,,3035,4.966403162055336

2866479,5,B000RF1QE2,It's not all about football!  I thought it was so did not tune in when it came out. It is a great program and I am now on season 3.  The stories are engrossing and the games are just the exciting highlights.  I recommend it to all you woman who also did not watch it because you don't like football.  I keep staying up past my bedtime watching episode after episode and will be sorry when I come to the end of this 5 year series.  It is THAT good.,1362441600,,447,3.922222222222222

He read the book and really enjoys that the show is so different from the movie. It is much different from a lot of the crap on tv, and it opens up dialogue between us about things and questions he has about high school and life in general. The dynamic of the coach and his wife is great and how he deals with both family issues and issues within his own team. Overall great show. Anything that opens conversation with my 16 year old about 'life' is welcome in my home.",1362441600,,636,4.221311475409836

2866489,5,B000RF1QE2,"""Friday  Night Lights"" was an exceptional series.  If you have ever lived in a small town, you will recognize the people of Dillon.  You will also recognize the danger inherent in high school sports heroism being the highlight of of a young man's life.

I only wish I had had a guidance counselor like Tami Taylor.  On a baser note, I also wish that the high school football heroes of my day had looked like Tim Riggins.",1361923200,2,420,4.402597402597403

2866492,4,B000RF1QE2,"It was not obvious to me that I'd be drawn into a story of high school football in a small west Texas town.  However, I was.  It's all about the characters.  They grapple with some interesting problems and they grow from their experiences.  There is depth in the characterizations.  It's not highly sophisticated, but it is interesting.

They almost lost me when the brought in the lawyer.  I'm personally tired of sociopathic lawyers who will sue anybody as long as they stand to make money. (Oh, oh, I'm sorry, they are ""just acting in the best interests of their client"" aren't they.  But we do have troubles with mercinaries don't we.)  But, I'm told the writers of the story soon get over this social dissolution.

2866496,4,B000RF1QE2,"We have been enjoying watching the first season of ""Friday Night Lights.""  Although I had seen it on TV and had read that it was a good series, I had never watched any of the episodes.  Because it is on Amazon Prime (viewing) on our Roku, we opted to try it.  You get caught in watching the next and the next and the next and before you know it, you watched 3 or 4 episodes in a row.  I like that!  It is a series where you just have to watch the next episode to find out what happens next.
That being said, when it boils down, it is a series where teens have many growing pains and the results of their peer pressure both good and bad.  Interesting.
It is nice to see a marriage that is good and that they really are crazy about one another.  I like that, too.",1361836800,,761,3.9671052631578947

The lives of these individuals are treated with great care and respect, and the actors are almost uniformly perfect. You come to understand and care for them as you would your own friends. Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton are particularly noteworthy in the leads. Unfortunately by the end of season one, the sloppiness of some of the writing starts to show.

The show actually stars Kyle Chandler, Connie Britton, Taylor Kitsch, Zach Gilford, Aimee Teegarden, Minka Kelly, Scott Porter, Brad LeLand, Gaius Charles and Adrienne Palicki. Did I forget anyone? Oh, and Derek Phillips.

Noble Chase Pack played a very minor character (little brother to Minka Kelly's character) for one episode. Cindy Creekmore played a character I can't even remember. Possibly the real estate lady who showed up in a few episodes. She is certainly not the star! Matthew Greer isn't even listed as far as I can tell. Every single season of FNL is listed incorrectly.

2866552,3,B000RF1QE2,"I'm late to the party, I know. ""Friday Night Lights"" season one ended a few years ago, but thanks to the joys of Netflix Wii streaming, I've discovered the show. I'd been meaning to watch it for a while because it garnered nothing but gushing acclaim. Tonight, I finished season one and started to check out various reviews, wondering if any reviewers had seen what I did.

Nary a one did. I'm posting this so a bit different voice can be heard.

I'd give this show 2.5 stars on a 5-star scale. It has annoying characters, especially the head coach, Eric Taylor. He's very egocentric and selfish in his personal life. His wife does an ok-ok job of calling him on it, but she ought to do more. He has a hard time seeing her perspective, and he is not respectful of her at all. I honestly don't see them as a healthy, respectful married pair. He expects his wife and daughter to be his sidekicks and yes-people.

One season is enough. I doubt I'll be watching the next season.

Pros: Coach Taylor IS decent to his players, especially an injured player. Nice study of race relations (but anti-gay messages. For example, the coach is anti-gay). Some interesting teen story lines and positive portrayals of people in wheelchairs, especially Herc.

Other cons: Whiny teenager drama. Too much teen sex (half the teen population seems to have gotten involved with an adult). Teens who look thirty. Wacky times (six a.m. piano lessons? Small stores opening at six a.m.?). Too many coincidences of characters running into each other-lazy writing, in other words.",1340236800,,1552,4.733333333333333

2866556,4,B000RF1QE2,"Clear heads. Full hearts. Can't lose.

Football is everything in the small town of Dillon, Texas. High expectations rest on the shoulders of the brand new High School Coach, Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler). He has immediate respect on the field, and a certain amount of respect among the township, but whether he stays or he goes depends on the outcome of his first game. His wife Tami (Connie Britton) wastes no time in ""becoming useful,"" in applying to be a counselor at the school, while his daughter Julie (Aimee Teegarden) catches the eye of young Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford), his back-up quarterback. The real star of the Panthers is Jason Street (Scott Porter), a young man with terrific instincts whom everyone knows is destined for stardom...

Until he puts his head down in a game, and winds up with a broken spine. Jason is crippled from the waist down and his injury sends shockwaves through Dillon, influencing everyone in his life -- his girlfriend Lyla (Minka Kelley), his best friend Tim (Taylor Kitsch), Tim's girlfriend Tyra (Adrianne Palicki), and especially Matt, who has to step up and take his place in the heat of the moment -- a place he is not prepared for. Coach Taylor has gone from having a sure-fire shot at the state championships to a team lost without its quarterback. His job, and his reputation, are on the line, not to mention the healing that must go in the lives of everyone involved.

I'm not a big football fan, but as this first season unfolded I became caught up in these characters' lives and learned to truly care about them as individuals, as well as be excited for the outcome of their games. The success of this series is that it makes you invest emotionally in what happens next. It tackles sensitive topics with surprising and at times unexpected results. It is as all-American as it gets and that's nice. Most of the young people are deeply flawed, but always we have the Taylor family to fall back on -- a marriage that has routine arguments but remains strong, headed up by a man willing to put aside his dreams to be what his wife and daughter need. He is a father figure to the boys on the team, strong when he needs to be, and unflinching in doing the right thing. If you do not admire him midway through the season, you're missing the point.

One of the most stirring episodes revolves around racism, when an assistant coach makes a stupid remark on television. I expected a completely different outcome to this two-episode arc than we were given; the show surprised me with its implication that people ought to be given second chances. The Taylors often fight, but their marriage is strong regardless. In fact, their biggest fight toward the end of the season is over who wants to be more selfless! I will admit that the implications of teenage sexuality were unfortunate, because it does somewhat diminish the luster of this series packing a moral punch. My biggest sorrow is that these kids act like Christians in church, but do not act like it outside of church. I don't think it is an implication of hypocrisy nearly as much as a sad reminder of the biggest threat to young people today: not living out their faith. If you choose to watch this series, it will reward you with some profound moments and many tears of both happiness and sorrow... but let it remind you that it's not enough to say you are a believer. You have to live it.

Parental concerns: Implied teenage sex on numerous occasions, including some heavy duty make-out sessions and ""afterward"" opening scenes. A character is almost raped but fights off her assailant. There is a lot of underage drinking and some brutal fighting, in addition to football-related violence. Several times, beatings include hospitalization-worthy results. Bad language is mild but frequent.",1334016000,,3791,4.729198184568835
2866557,5,B000RF1QE2,"Listen People, I never, in my 42 years, thought it possible for something this powerful to appear on network television. Here is a program with meaning and depth. It is produced with such honest vitality and creative skill that I was swept up in virtually every scene of every episode. I can not say enough about the power of this series. It addresses the complexities of our human (and American) condition in real ways. The actors inhabit their characters so completely, its scary. The writing is not at all trite or simplified. Its asks the viewer to consider things thoughtfully, without spoon-feeding the viewer a moral buffet. Let me finish by saying that I have known my wife for 8 years, and she has always HATED football. No more. Because of the humanizing way this show portrays the sport and the lives of each of the young players, my wife understands more about football, how it is played, and the kinds of men that play and coach the game. So guys, if you want your wives to let you watch more football, get her hooked on this. You can stream it on Netflix. You will thank me later.",1326844800,,1094,4.53030303030303

2866559,5,B000RF1QE2,"The big question for me is ""How did I miss seeing this show when it was actually on television?"" As I read other reviews, I saw that it was only on NBC for one season, and then was picked up by DirecTV. I've concluded that, since it's not rude or crude, but instead is an emotional, heart-felt portrayal of life in a small town, the media decided it wasn't worth their time. Interesting that Kyle Chandler won Best Actor at this year's Emmy awards.
Anyhow, after every episode I find myself saying ""I love this show."" I love the stories of the families, I love that each episode builds on the previous episode, and I especially love watching the chemistry and interaction between the coach (Kyle Chandler) and his wife (Connie Britton). The writing is exceptional--what a true-life picture of the struggles, compromises, defeats and victories encountered in a marriage and in life itself. If only more couples loved each other as much, and realized that a marriage takes work, compromise, and commitment, the divorce rate in the US would drop significantly.

Friday Night Lights as a series has flaws but it is still great.  The first season of the show was as perfect an initial season can be.  While the show does fall off during the second season, the third season was based on redemption, and the fourth and fifth had a cast overhaul, this first season will help you develop surprisingly emotional connections with all the characters.

2866566,5,B000RF1QE2,"I don't think you need me explaining to you what this TV series is about. Suffice it to say the first season is certainly one of the best given it's an incredible 22 episodes long. That length alone allows stories and characters to develop at pretty much the pace of actual life in this fictional small Texas town.

What is hilarious is the fact almost every football game shown has the Dillon Panthers winning and usually in overly dramatic ""cardiac kids"" fashion. When in one episode the play-by=play announcer says the Panthers are at .500, it doesn't jive with what we see throughout the first season as they basically almost never lose.

I think the series loses a lot by not showing more of the losses. It would have added more drama. Even so you'll be in tears in a lot of episodes as the writers sure know how to wring emotions out weekly. They also address many of the off-field problems associated with high school football (steroids, racism, sexism, alcohism and any other -isms that you can think of), but ultimately it's an optimistic and highly uplifting series. Plus you do not even have to like football to enjoy this. The relationships are what this series are all about. Throw in the choicest guys and girls on TV and that makes for as good eye candy as the football action.

The extras are a bunch of deleted scenes and a ""making of"" that I actually wished was a bit longer.

I'm sure after you get through this all you'll agree Coach Taylor (Kyle Chandler) and fullback Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch) are the stars of the series for their ability to let just a look or a few words tell so much.",1310169600,2,1611,4.506849315068493
2866567,5,B000RF1QE2,"Ok...let me say that as a sports and movie fan, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST TV SERIES THAT IS HAVE EVER SEEN in my entire life!!!! No joke. I honestly feel a shamed that I just now started watching this series (even though it began around 5 years ago) but thank god for good friends, NetFlix, and DVDs! [lol]

But seriously....I just finished season 1 of this TV drama, and man it is great! This show does not get the credit, nor did it get the advertisement it deserved over the past 5 years. I think when people think of this title ""Friday Night Lights"" we automatically think back to the movie of Boobie Miles and Odessa Permian, but....this series is DEEPER and MUCH better than that, trust me!!!

I will not go into detail cause this series is just something that you have to see. Yes there is football, but it is around 10% about football folks! This series is about a small town that loves football and the community and players that make it up (and yes towns like these do exist). You learn so much about each characters life, along with their hardships and struggles. This series touches on love, relationships, sex, team work, trust, racism, infidelity, morals, tough love, etc....the list goes on. But anything we will or may have gone through in life, this show has it.

The acting is excellent (beautiful women in this show too) i.e.- Minka Kelly, and the setting is superb! The story line just keeps you watching and watching.....each episode is around 45 minutes long, but after about the 3rd you are just hooked! DRAWN IN!!! I mean I'm just blown away about how good this show really is! You will laugh, tear up, feel the pain, cheer, and relate to a lot of these characters (Matt Saracen reminds me of me) and Tim Riggins is another one of my favorites.

But on the minute down side the only thing I had a small problem with was how ""cheesy"" the football game scenes were...they are very believable to an extent, but also a bit too dramatic....but Im telling you this show is about MUCH more than football which is why I love it!!! Folks buy this, Im about to start season 2 of this series as we speak....but I promise this show will not disappoint, season 1 to me was EXCELLENT!

As people say, you don't need to like football to like this show, but if you like football, you are in for an even bigger treat. You'll actually find yourself looking forward to each game. If you don't like football, there are plenty of great, realistic, heart-felt stories in-between the games to enjoy.

The relationships are what makes this show golden, and I'm not strictly talking romantic relationship. Tami/Eric, Matt/Julie, Lyla/Jason are all really great, but personally, my two favorite relationships are Coach Taylor and his daughter and the Coach's relationship with Matt. Kyle Chandler portrays Coach Taylor so realistically, and it's touching to see his character interact with the younger ones. He has so much heart and compassionate, and even though he comes across as being really intense at times, deep down, his family and his players mean the world to him.

There aren't a lot of special features on the season 1 DVD, which is the only downside. The deleted scenes are a nice touch, but make sure to watch them after watching each episode. They'll make more sense, and you'll find yourself saying, ""Oh, I know where this scene would have gone!"" Some deleted scenes are better than others; whereas, some are like ""Yeah, I see why this didn't make the final cut.""

The other special feature is about the making of season 1. There are a lot of cute behind-the-scenes clips. Kyle Chandler is a character in a couple of the interviews he gives. It's nice to see the cast and crew being all together and having fun.

I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the series just as much, if not more, than the movie. Although I find the character ""Smash"" rather irritating (and Rigg's self-destructiveness gets old fast) he is more than offset by the eye candy of the stunning characters Tyra and Lyla - very nice indeed. I like the action of the football games and the varying character dramas aren't bad. I also like how it shows the can do American spirit and never say quit attitude that has made our country great.",1267228800,,581,4.650485436893204
2866588,5,B000RF1QE2,"So much emphasis is placed on stereotypes in the world of literary criticism and social commentary that contemporary writers are often afraid of writing archetypes into their works. But the creators of 'Friday Night Lights' were brave and diligent enough to find those archetypes in small-town life and breath character into them.

FNL's bravery pays off in character roles as small as that of Ray ""Voodoo"" Tatum, an archetype representing Milton's Lucifer in 'Paradise Lost'. Voodoo isn't just the devil, he's the corporeal embodiment of temptation itself. Displaced from New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina, Voodoo becomes heavily courted by a number of rival schools. He becomes available to Dillon (the fiction high school the show is based on), but only at the cost of compromising Coach Taylor's integrity. Staying true to his archetype, Voodoo returns in the final episode of season one, approaching Smash Williams with one last temptation.

An archetype fleshed out into a full character is Buddy Garrity. A car dealership owner and Dillon Panthers booster, Buddy is the childish philanderer who is nonetheless charismatic in his gregarious nature and enthusiasm for Panthers football. He's the charmer that, like Voodoo, is something of a snake in the town to tempt Coach Taylor into wrong-doing.

And of course Kyle Chandler plays Coach Eric Taylor, the patriarch of the Taylor household and the Dillon football program. Coach Taylor is the good man that just wants to faithfully serve all his conflicting loyalties (the team, town, family), and he must agonize over temptations that offer themselves as shortcuts to the problems he agonizes over. Weighing on his conscience is his wife and confidant Tami, who simultaneously challenges and supports him in the way only a good mature marriage can achieve.

Every character around the Taylors is true to small-town Texas life. There's just no living between the Mississippi and the Rockies without meeting Matt Saracen and Landry Clarke (we call them goobers), the pair of off-beat friends whose antics make growing up in a small town so eventful (I've spent enough time in rest homes to know Matt's grandmother as well).

No matter the archetype, no matter the misdeeds, every character has a charm and likability almost unique to FNL. Even characters as different from one another as Tyra and Lyla, two girls from completely different social statuses and outlooks, grow on the viewer with an equal amount of sympathy.

Inevitably with a drama with sexually-active teens, there are's loads of hurt and anguish, and this is handled organically by the series, with really no hints of feeling contrived. The apparent dichotomy of devout Christians straying and cheating is handled responsibly, without any hints that the show creators are sneering at the downfalls of their characters. One senses they respect their struggling characters, and one's heart is left full and aching.

The pilot episode is a great American masterpiece. 'Explosions In The Sky' made for great scoring. The shaky cam makes for surprisingly intimate visuals.

I just know that I get very frustrated every time someone complains about the lack of quality television, but then they say they don't watch FNL. What gives? It doesn't matter if you hate football, Texas or teen dramas, because this goes way beyond any of the stereotypes. It's about the people. Regular people who don't have any super powers and are not filthy rich. The stories told are ones we can all relate to. I think the problem with the lack of ratings is that the plots do sound ordinary and even boring, but it's how they are presented on FNL that is so magical.

If you haven't see the show and you're worried that you might not like it, don't worry. I have yet to meet anyone who has watched a few episodes and wasn't hooked. One note though, these episodes must be watched with your full attention. You can't chat on the computer, text message, or do anything else while watching. If you do, you'll miss so much. There are so many emotions conveyed by the characters with just a look, or twitch of the mouth, and the camera zeros in on even subtle actions, like how a person is standing, or a hand movement.

2866600,5,B000RF1QE2,"I was the most skeptical person when I first watched this television series.  I'm not a fan of the movie, football, and generally I'm not a fan of dramas involving high school students.  But that isn't what Friday Night Lights is about.  FNL is about life and choices, struggles and celebrations.

Friday Night Lights will melt the coldest, most skeptical heart if you give it a chance. Simply put, it captures the true essence of not only small Texas football towns, but also the very bonds that tie people together.  You will feel a part of the Taylor family.  You're best friend will be Matt Saracen or Julie Taylor.  You'll smile, laugh, and cry because the cast and show are so in sync with character development that they literally jump out of the screen and become a part of your life.

This is because of the freedom of movement the producers give the actors.  The cameras and characters flow freely without rehersals, performing their roles passionately.  As a result, you experience not merely a televised performance but a literal mirror into another world.  From the opening soundtrack to the closing credits everything comes so natural: the music, scene, and people are so authentic it literally breaks primetime telivision molds.

Ultimately, this is the reason why it's run will be short-lived.  Soak in Friday Night Lights for all its worth, you won't ever see another show quite like it once its gone.",1234742400,3,1418,4.83402489626556

What really sets this show apart is the chemistry of the cast coupled with the superb writing.  It gives a realistic look at high school in a small distressed town. It's not candy coated or sappy, but it's not overly dramatic. FNL is easily one of the greatest shows on television.",1234483200,2,466,4.295454545454546
2866602,5,B000RF1QE2,"Although I'm not a fan of sports in general, I've actually seen quite a few sports-related films. Friday Night Lights is probably one of my fav. movies involving sports, mostly because of the excellent writing and directing. I decided to give the series a shot since I'm such a fan of the movie.

In my opinion the show offers some of the best writing on television. The first episode was decent, but I didn't actually get hooked until the third episode (normal for me). Now, I just finished watching all three seasons -- it's that good.

The first season is pure brilliance -- great storytelling; some of the best relationship drama I've ever seen. The writing is so true to life with family situations, and relationships. You really feel what these characters are going through, not just because of the writing, but also thanks to some top-notch performances by all these young fairly unknown (not as much now) leads.

The second and third seasons were still very good, but neither can top of first. Then again, the writer's strike really took a toll on the show, causing both the 2nd and 3rd seasons to split and end with much less episodes than before. Either way, it was still nice to see these characters progress and evolve to bigger and better things (going to dif. colleges).

Even for those who don't like sports (me), you can still get into it for the excellent storytelling it offers. Hopefully the series gets picked up for one last season, but I hear NBC isn't too keen on the show anymore, so who knows. I think the show has one more season in it before they're forced to bring in all new characters (since the ones we've followed would all be in college already).",1233705600,,1679,4.605351170568562

I am not sure if it was officiall cancelled but then it was picked up by satellite, though I have not seen those episodes.

Firday Night Lights generally follows a smalll town and a high school football team, but to think of it as football would be wrong.  It is a common element for the charactors but there is so much more.  It really is about the players, the coaches and town and their lives and struggles, along with success along the way.

Kyle Chandler is superb in his role as the coach of the team.  A proper blend of toughness and caring.  His wife is just as brilliant in her acting, and in fact you would be hard pressed to find anyone in the cast who does not do an incredible job.  From the peoplein the athletic depretment to the local businessmen who sponsor the team.

The first season sets the background right away as a player is injured and expands to bring the other people into the storyline quickly.  No one is perfect and no one is toatlly evil and these nuances come out.

2866622,1,B000RF1QE2,"Friday Night Lights is a show which is unorthodox glaringly because it focuses on a seemingly boring subject: high-school football in a small, rural, southern town. The reason an audience has eluded this show is precisely because of this seemingly boring premise, yet the ardent defenders of this show will sensitively cite character development, themes and ""heart"" of the show. Another reason critics dislike the show is because of the jerky camera which resembles amateur camera work, or even a drunkard fooling around behind the scenes. The plan of the producers was obviously to make the show more ""realistic"" by doing the extreme close-ups and the like, but they failed heavily.

For my money, I refuse to care about the aforementioned criticisms of this show because I feel that my criticism of this show should be the only reason why people dislike this show. In my view, the most obvious affront of FNL is how it disparagingly stereotypes red-state Texans!!!! Whether it's their Christian religion, their southern accents, their passion for football, or their small-town folksiness, white, Christian Americans are being ridiculed in this show because FNL is an elitist show made by Hollywood liberals. In fact, the only reason this show is so popular among critics (read: liberal shills who vote Democrat) is because it reinforces, in its discriminatory stereotyping, the views of liberals on the coast of people in red-state, ""flyover states.""

Here are some abominable examples of abusive, liberal-elitist stereotyping in FNL's 1st season.

First and foremost is the way many of the actors absolutely parody the southern accent of their characters. Lyla Garrity sounds like a bimbo-ish airhead with her perkiness. The Matt Saracen (does anyone know Saracen means ""Arab"" or ""Muslim""; how PC can you get!) and Landry characters epitomize what liberals on the coast think of Southerners. This is demonstrated inarguably by the way the actors have their characters speak in their southern drawls. Matt's always insecure and like ""Uuuuuh, hi there J-J-Julie (Coach Taylor's daughter)!"" His best buddy, Landry, relentlessly utters lines like ""Uuuuuh, h-h-hi there, Tyra. D-d-do you want suuum help wit dat?"" The point is that the liberal actors intentionally speak their southern accents to make Texans look as inbred, dumb and uncouth as libs stereotype them to be!!!!

Another maltreatment is how FNL shows these red-state Texans in social/cultural situations which are often at odds with the Christians they are.

For instance, the Lyla character is a Christian as is her dad, Buddy, yet both are written by the liberal writers to be such personal hypocrites with their cheating on their respective significant others. Lyla, of course, cheats with the lowlife miscreant Riggins while her dad is thrown out of the house by his wife after he admits to an affair. These story developments aren't defensible enough to be cited as mere plot devices; it's inarguably blatant that they're meant to derogate Christians as hypocrites, and one can almost imagine the gloating schadenfreude the liberal writers experienced while penning this BS.

In criticizing this shabbiness of a TV show, I cannot omit the egregious exaggeration of ""religiosity"" that's skewered by the writers. Again, one can just imagine the sadistic, liberal-slanting writers gloating with malice when they contrive scenes which show the characters in prayer, such as before a big game. The way the mocking writers derogatively portray Texans is almost like the unflattering movie Jesus Camp where Christians are misrepresented as ""Jesus Freaks"" and general radicals. This is irrefutably established in scenes showing characters like Smash and his fat momma praying with their eyes closed and mouths open as if in rapture.

Yet another unforgivable trespass is the abuse of the Iraq war veteran (Matt Saracen's father) to make a barely veiled attack against the Iraq war policy!!!! The context of the episode arc featuring Matt's father was to disparagingly mischaracterize Iraq vets as returning to troubled homes without enough money to make ends meet. Viewers WILL remember that Matt's father wanted to move the family out of town because he couldn't afford healthcare for Matt's senile/demented grandma and even took a job as a used car salesman.

Completing the lib-elitist stereotypes is an episode dealing with racism where Smash is allegedly defamed by one of the assistant coaches due to his black skin color. Of course, subordinating to the liberal ideology, the assistant coach looks like a bigot full of hatred while Smash is doubtfully portrayed as a courageous ""martyr"" who stands up for his ""rights"" despite the fact that his actions actually hurt his whole team!!!!

As I lectured earlier in my thesis, the reason critics (read: liberal agents planted in the media) love FNL is because it reinforces all the demeaning stereotypes of white, red-state, Christian Southerners. FNL questionably depicts all characters in Dillon to be basically white trash from broken homes, white trash who drink and copulate excessively, and white trash who are economically destitute. All the lowest, unflattering tangents are here, whether it's driving pickups or wearing ballcaps or polishing shotguns.",1208476800,16,5271,5.295454545454546
2866623,5,B000RF1QE2,"I got into this show for 2 reasons. The first one is I love football. The second one is that I loved the movie.

Now I didn't think this show was going to be nearly as good as the movie, since it's not based on a true story and it's on a TV budget... not a movie budget. But I still wanted to give it a try. And man am I glad I did. Friday Night Lights is MUCH more than just some dumb football show. Yes it does have football and yes it's centered on football, but in all honesty, it feels like football is just a secondary to the great story that we have going on right before our eyes.

Coach Eric Taylor has taken the reigns as the new head coach of The Dillon Panthers football team. QB#1 Jason Street is the golden boy on the team. He's supposedly one of the best quarterbacks that's ever been seen (according to Notre Dame at least). A close second to Jason would be Brian `Smash' Williams. The star running back that can actually back up the big mouth he has. Smash is also a star player that WILL be going somewhere someday. The Panthers are littered with talent in other spots as well, but a curveball is thrown to them in their first game of the season and Jason Street has to leave the game only to be replaced by the somewhat shy Matthew Saracen. Can Saracen help lead the team and win them and Coach Taylor the first game of the season? Well, watch the show and find out...hehe.

Coach Taylor is played by Kyle Chandler. His wife Tami is played by Connie Britton. I seriously do not think they are even acting when you see these two together. I completely forget I'm watching actors. They meld together so seamlessly you would think they are actually married. You can see the love in their eyes when they talk to each other on just little things like grocery shopping. You can see the hurt in their eyes when one of them slips up with the wrong thing said. You can see the irritation in their actions of having to explain themselves to one another because they've been together for so long. And even though they have their faults... they have the type of relationship most of us look forward to having one day (hopefully). Julie Taylor, their daughter, is played by the ever so cute Aimee Teegarden. She is perfectly matched with her parents. Even though she acts a little to smart for britches (like my grandpa used to say), she is still a really good daughter... who Matthew Saracen has a secret crush on. It's great to watch this high school romance happen between the two. It seems almost real to me. Saracen always starts to talk, only to come out with half sentences before she walks off, because he can barely keep his head straight when she's around... lol... I love it. These two relationships on camera work so well that you really do just fall back into high school again as a teenager. Plus, and boy have I been there, the relationship between Coach Taylor and Matthew Saracen has to be some of the funniest stuff to watch. Poor Matt gets in from Coach on AND off the field.

That's only two things I love about this show with much more going on that I won't really go into great detail. But you have Tim Riggins who is the `misunderstood bad boy'. Sounds pretty clich but it he pulls it off pretty darn well. Then you have Lyla Garrity, the beautiful (and oh is she ever) cheerleader/church girl that is going to marry Jason Street one day. She's slowly being pushed away by Jason because of what he's going through. Her life and future is changing drastically, and sadly, around her. Tyra Collete is, what I'm thinking at least, the school bad girl (drinking and sex of course). Her home living is a mess due to her mom and her school life is bad because she's always with Tim Riggins and she's just doesn't care about school. Or so we think. Another funny character is Landry Clarke, the best friend of Saracen. Just about every part he's in has me laughing.

Friday Night Lights deal with a lot of high school issues such as love, sex, family, drugs, and friendships. The one thing that I just did NOT care for AT ALL was the few episodes on racism. A friend of mine said the same exact thing to me the other day when he got done watching the show. That's the only thing I just did not like at all about this show. It seemed like it had no actual ground to be brought up. Like it was forced on us. And it was basically one coach vs. all the black kids (kids... not parents) on the team. It was completely idiotic and just seemed out of place. Ah well.

I thought the show was going to be cancelled after the second season, but thankfully it's still alive and made it into the third season. I just don't see how TV execs can cancel such a good show when they don't even have any idea of where to put it on TV. The first time was up against American Idol (I believe)... and the second time is on Friday Night. Um. Don't you think your main targeted audience would be OUT on Friday Night watching high school football games or going out and hanging out with friends? Hmmm... smart thinking TV execs.

As for this DVD set, it's got some good extras on it, according to my friend. Sorry I haven't gotten around to them yet. But for 20 bucks... this is a STEAL of a deal.

Support Friday Night Lights. Don't let another good TV show get cancelled again (I miss you Arrested Development!)",1208304000,14,5311,4.3093093093093096

This show is set in Texas and follows the lives of several people / families in a tight-nit community who are crazy over football. Football is the backdrop of this show, however it is really about everyday people, their relationships and struggles. The characters and their stories draw you in, and I think most people would be able to relate and enjoy them. The film style is different from what we currently see on tv and is an art form in itself.

2866636,5,B000RF1QE2,"I thought the first episode of Friday Night Lights was filled with foolball clich and outright ripping off Remember the Titans and Varsity Blues.  Fortunately I gave the show another try.  I'm not entirely sure where the turning point was when I went from finding the show clichd to being one of the upper tier of great television but I have a feeling it had to do with the greatness of Landry Clarke, Matt Saracen's socially challenged, math loving best friend.

Landry isn't the only great character on the show, if fact every character on the show is well crafted, from the cast members right down to the guest stars (well Tyra's mother aside). You end up getting deeply involved with each and every one of them and the camera work and the locations makes you feel like you are actual resident of the town of Dillon, Texas. You are heartbroken when Tyra gets assaulted. You feel the pain when Jason finds out his girlfriend cheated with his girlfriend. Emotions wash over you when Mrs. Taylor confronts her daughter when she finds out she is planning to have sex. And even as clichd as most of the games were (how many games did they come from behind from to win on the final play?), you still get the tingles when the games start and are on the edge of your seat when the games inevitably goes down to the wire.

Now I am not one to talk about acting because there are actually very few great actors in Hollywood. And most acting awards are given not to the best actor but to the best written characters as great writing can make moderate actors seem like great actors (see Sarah Michelle Gellar in Buffy the Vampire Slayer). With that said, all the award shows that haven't recognize Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton, have instantly lost all credibility, But whenever Chandler and Britton were on screen together I started to smile because I knew something great was coming up. And nobody does the passive aggressive annoyance better than Kyle Chandler, just see any scene he is in with Buddy Garrity.

Keep in mind the DVD is bare bones in terms of extra, but still, having the whole season for under twenty dollars is a steal.",1204329600,5,2133,4.558746736292428

He is guided through this Inferno by another paraplegic (and my favorite character), Herc, whose blend of sarcasm and support allow Jason to find and express the ""better man"" that lies within.

2866643,4,B000RF1QE2,"3.5 stars

I initially avoided this show.  It looked like another tired teen drama set around an improbable string of close football finishes.  I also heard that the pilot included a horrifying injury to a main character and I just did not feel like taking on a long term commitment to a fictional character that would make me sad.  But when my favorite sports columnist (Bill Simmons) took it as his personal quest to keep FNL from getting canceled and pleaded with his readers to check it out I put Season 1 on my Netflix queue.  It turns out I was about half right.  The show is full of gorgeous 25 year olds pretending to be teenagers except for the adult nature of their romantic and sexual relationships.  Ethnic stereotypes are in full swing.  The football games were close (only one was decided with the Panthers on defense during the final possession).  And the injury arc is vesting and difficult.

However, three unexpected qualities of this show make it not only watchable but engaging.

1. At the center of the cast is one of the healthiest, most inspiring marriages I've encountered in visual media in some time.  Coach Taylor and his wife challenge each other, respect each other, admit fault, banter playfully and work hard to keep it interesting.  As a partnership of two very strong personalities they believably fight often but they also fight well, rarely overstepping the boundaries of respect and always coming to a place of self evaluation.  They serve as a moral center for the kids of the school and many in the community.  Both actors embody their characters in believable and compelling ways and I was completely vested in them before I was vested in the team or the series.

2. Much has been made of the ubiquitous unsteady cam.  I have no opinion on this.  I find it neither artistically overwhelming nor particularly distracting.  But it is not the artistic center of this show.  I appreciate art that can convey a sense of place, capturing details that unveil the beauty of particularity that makes a community home to some (e.g. Steinbeck or Garden State).  It is obvious that this series has been filmed with the artistic eye of a very good film maker.  Particularly when Texas montages are used to transition between scenes, you get the sense that `Dillon, Texas' is at once sad and beautiful and, though foreign in its dissimilarity, it is fundamentally the same as the place I grew up or the place I now live.

3. Finally, the character of Matt Serecen is so endearing that he almost makes the series worth following by himself.  The suddenly promoted backup quarterback is a quirky, artistic `sophomore' with very adult responsibilities.  FNL is most interesting when he and/or the Taylors are on screen.  He and his friend Landry (a Matt Damon look-alike in the `school geek' role, but I digress) have 80% of the laugh out loud lines in the season.

So, while, like most teen dramas, I feel a bit creepy watching FNL, there was enough actual substance and art here to keep me watching and to allow me to recommend it.",1203465600,4,3055,4.704331450094162
2866644,5,B000RF1QE2,"I had heard this show referred to as ""one of the best shows no one is watching,"" so I decided to give it a try. It exceeded my expectations by miles.

The pilot had a bit too much going on for my taste, and it left me thinking that I'd never figure out who was who and what was going on... But the second episode completely hooked me and I feel like I ""know"" all these characters personally at this point!

If the writing is phenomenal, the acting is out of this world amazing. It doesn't feel like your usual recurring TV drama; it feels much more like a documentary. I found that I became very attached to the characters and was often on the edge of my seat wondering how things would work out for them. Even the characters that you ""shouldn't like"" grow on you!

Since it has ""football"" in the title, I can imagine that it has turned non-football fans off to trying the show. I happen to love football, so those scenes are great, but I have friends who don't like football who I ""made"" watch this and they absolutely love this show! The football games actually get very little time in the episodes; the story of the characters struggles and accomplishments is the true focus.

Personally, I don't care for the extreme close-ups, because sometimes they don't include the person's eyes.  But I suppose the camera work is one of the things that differentiate this series from the competition.

Texas high school football is the underlying thread that ties all the episodes together, but I wouldn't call this a program about football.  It's really about relationships.",1202515200,,647,4.8807339449541285
2866647,5,B000RF1QE2,"I'm not even kidding.

With the writer's strike going on, I took a chance and watched the pilot episode of Friday Night Lights on NBC's website. That was enough - just the pilot - to make me want the rest of the season. (That was when I promptly ordered this DVD set from Amazon. When it arrived, my boyfriend and I sat down and devoured the whole season in a weekend, which seems to be pretty standard for others who watch the first season.)

If you're thinking, ""I'm not into football - why would I want to watch a show about it,"" then stop! That's what I thought at first. But it's not about football. Yes, football is in it (high school football), but it's about people. It is raw, and real, and it cuts through to the soul every episode.

2866651,5,B000RF1QE2,"I teach at an art school here in San Francisco and last semester one of my students (hi Kate) kept plugging this show, saying it was the best show on TV, she even wrote a paper analyzing it and in general propounding Friday Night Lights as one of the great art spectacles of our day and eventually, at Christmastime, I gave in and started watching the first season on DVD.  Well, I had read the original nonfiction book back when it first came out and I admired it, but I was thinking, a whole show based on that book would be depressing with a capital D.  Suffice it to say that after the pilot I was hooked, and so was my wife (who hates sports and hates sports shows even more).  It was like a Christmas miracle on Minna Street.  Now that we have watched the whole of season one, I can happily say that, we are wondering how to contain our impatience until the second season gets boxed up.  Especially with the writers strike which seems to mean that season two will end at 13 episodes.

Oh well, I forgot to mention that pundits claim that, like HEROES, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS took a dramatic and misjudged turn early on in season two which led to fans' outrage.  I wonder what it could be!  People said that melodrama had come to Dillon High School.  Well, season one was entirely about melodrama so how bad could it be?

The hardest thing to believe in FNL is that Jason Street is in high school.  The actor who plays him is talented, sort of, but he's got to be thirty if he's a day!  I know that the Texas sun could age a person and that Lady Bird Johnson looked thirty when she was a mere girl, but come on, this guy is supposed to be 17 and he could be playing a teacher at the school.  Most of the other kids seem roughly of high school age, so Jason Street stands out for sure.  In fact the girl who plays Julie seems sometimes as though she were 11 or 12, when she decides she wants to explore her sexuality I felt like the show was moving into Lolita country here.

Everyone is fantastically beautiful.  But that's probably exactly right.  I have only been to Texas a few times but everyone *was* beautiful, though in a slightly different vein than the actors on FNL.  Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton, come on!  There isn't a better looking couple on TV and Kyle in particular is like Tom Brady in looks, you just want to shut your eyes and capture that steeljawed magnetism forever, especially when he's mad at a player.  The one who's on the plain side is Grandma Saracen, but then the poor actress is hampered by having to play the part like she's just about to slide into Alzheimer's Disease, and she's only 42.  She's close to the real life age of Jason Street, and you can tell she has no idea of how a real life elderly woman would respond in the stupid situations they dream up for her.

That scene where Matt has to pretend he's his own grandfather and sing ""Mr Sandman"" to his grandma to calm her down was just about the dumbest thing I've seen on TV in generations.  But then why do I give it five stars?  Because it has a fresh, hand held vigor that distinguishes itself immediately from most TV shows.  The storylines aren't too byzantine, and if cliches pop up from time to time (whenever two cheaters kiss they are always immediately observed by the person who would get most upset), the honest dramatic acting sort of obscures these flaws.

The characters are so well developed and acted out that you can't help but have feelings for all of them. I think that some of the situations that the younger ones find themselves in are a bit too adult (traveling to Mexico to help a friend during the school year with no adult intervention & drinking at the football field) but I can forgive the producers for this.  The interactions of the characters is so real and remarks made as asides are right on target.  I do love football but that is not why I love this show.

2866672,5,B000RF1QE2,"Friday Night Lights was a great book that was made into a great movie, but the television incarnation is probably the best by far. Shows with this much heart, superb acting, fantastic chemistry and incredible writing are few and far between on the television these days. It's just too bad that people think it's all about football.

While the show does feature a football team, or more specifically, the Dillon High School Panthers, the show is about so much more than just what happens on a field. It captures the lives of people in the small Texas town of Dillon and how football or the football team affects their lives. In a place where football is king, everybody is touched in one way or another by the local football team.

But, the show explores so much more than football, delving into the personal lives of the players, the new coach and his family and all the other people in town. It deals with complex issues, yet knows when to  insert the light moments that are always a part of life. There is no doubt that this show captures real life better than anything on television in the last few years.

FNL follows coach Eric Taylor (the perfectly-cast Kyle Chandler) as he takes over the Panthers after years as an assistant coach. He has a talented running back Smash Williams (Gaius Charles), a star quarterback Jason Street (Scott Porter) and a hard living full back Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch). However, he also has the expectations of the entire town on his shoulders, as everyone from the guy at the grocery store to the mayor has an opinion on how the team should be run, what plays should be used and more. The townspeople view this as their team and Coach Taylor is faced with balancing the wishes and needs of an entire community with what he knows is right for his team.

Things go horribly wrong in the first game of the season, the very first episode, when the star quarterback is paralyzed in an on-field incident, leaving the team in the hands of the quiet, shy backup quarterback, Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford). From there, viewers are drawn into the story of the Dillon Panthers and the people who cheer them on.

Coach Taylor and his wife Tammi (Connie Britton, who was also in the FNL movie) see their relationship put through some tests as the coach works through tough times with his team. However, it is her steadiness that keeps him going and helps him find a way through the hard times. Their daughter Julie (Aimee Teegarden) also becomes a handful as she enters her sophomore year in high school.

After being paralyzed, Street faces many critical choices as he fights to maintain some semblance of a life. His longtime girlfriend, cheerleader Lyla Garrity (the gorgeous Minka Kelly) stands by his side through the first part of his injury, but finds herself succumbing to the bad boy Riggins, who himself is having a hard time dealing with the injury to his teammate and best friend. The Lyla-Riggins storyline takes a tough turn when Jason finds out and stops talking to both of them. While the three eventually get back to talking, their relationship may never be the same.

Riggins has his own issues to deal with, as he lives with his brother thanks to his not present parents. He is constantly drinking and seemingly throwing his life away. The only place he feels complete is between the lines on Friday night. His relationship with Lyla also screws up the ""relationship""  he had with Tyra Collette (Adrianne Palicki), a union that was rocky at best to begin with.

As the new starting quarterback, Saracen finds himself in a place he is not comfortable, at the center of attention. The shy young man works hard on the field and off, taking care of his grandmother while his father is in Iraq. The return of Mr. Saracen provides a good storyline for Matt, who finds that things are almost easier without him there and when the elder Saracen returns to Iraq, Matt goes back to the fulltime care of his grandmother, who is seemingly dealing with worsening dementia. Perhaps the most touching storyline involves Matt and Julie, the coach's daughter, as they explore their blossoming relationship under the watchful eyes of Coach Taylor and the entire community. Matt also leans on his best friend, Landry Clarke (Jesse Plemons) for advice of all kinds, much of which is questionable at best.

The end of the season provides a glimpse at a relationship between Landry and Tyra, one that finds the two actors working a lot together and the chemistry is absolutely perfect. While the way the story is take to start season two is questionable, nobody can deny the chemistry between these two characters. They deserved the chance to shine and they got it.

A simple review like this can't even begin to touch on all the storylines and issues that cropped up in season one. From domestic violence to teen relationships, from alcohol abuse to adultery, this show touches on major issues in society and deals with them in a way that makes it absolutely impossible to stop watching.

The DVD set contains a number of deleted scenes and a great behind the scenes look at making the first season. The set I purchased also came with a money back guarantee, which tells the viewer that the people in charge believe in this show.

I was hooked on Friday Night Lights from the opening credits of the first episode and this DVD set brought me right back to them and I found it tough to not watch five or six episodes at a time when the clock was pushing midnight. This is a phenomenal show and a great DVD set and anybody who thinks that television isn't what it used to be needs to check this show out.",1194912000,3,5622,4.637185929648242
2866673,5,B000RF1QE2,"Maybe it's because I'm from a small town like Dillon, TX, or maybe it's because the writing, directing and acting are so amazing, but whatever the reason, this show has quickly become one of my all-time favorites.  It has all the teen angst of My So Called Life, plus so much more.  Growing up in a small Southern town where high school football really was a religion, I can so identify with this show (even though I was a nerdy kid who almost never went to football games).  Nonetheless, high school football players really were revered as gods, and cheerleaders really were seen as either sluts or goddesses (or both).  Church really was intertwined with every day life; small-town businessmen like Buddy Garrity really did have that much influence.  And even though I don't like football, my heart aches, breaks and rejoices for each and every character here, on and off the field.  This is simply one of the most beautiful, poignant, touching, intense pieces of television I have ever seen.  And at such a phenomenal price, it's quite a bargain.  Trust me, if you like My So Called Life, you will LOVE this show!",1194912000,2,1116,4.687179487179487
2866674,5,B000RF1QE2,"I don't own a television but through the generosity of NBC and wonders of a broadband internet hookup I've been able to watch the first season as well as all shows of the current season.  Kudos to NBC for making ALL of the episodes of the first year available online.  I note they've been removed recently but I'm happy to see this DVD available to prospective viewers.

One of the reasons I don't own a television is that most of what is available is dreck.  I probably would have ignored Friday Night Lights as well had I not come upon a glowing review of the show in the New York Times.  I visited the NBC site and found that full episodes were available.  I quickly began a marathon, watching all twenty four episodes of season one within a week.  That is a wonderful way to introduce oneself to a television show.

As has been observed by other reviewers football is very much in the background of this drama, the framework for considering the gritty stuff of life.  Fortunately, the writing is first rate and the performances uniformly excellent, permitting the producer to explore very real issues with honesty and power.  Although this show is several decibels quieter in presentation, it reminds me of Hill Street Blues, the first ensemble show that carried the story from episode to episode.  It is easy to care for the characters, regardless of their foibles.

I'll likely buy this DVD simply so that I have another chance to go through season one again without interruption.  In the meantime I'll keep current with episodes of season two as they appear.  This is definitely television worth fighting to keep going.  Tell your friends and share your DVDs.",1194739200,,1666,4.696551724137931

You want to be in the show, with the characters.  You want to help them in times of trouble, be with them in times of celebration.  Yes, ""Friday Night Lights"" has that great of an effect on you.

Apparently those who saw the first season were up in arms about the potential cancellation of the show. So we decided to watch the first season. We were blown away.

2866681,5,B000RF1QE2,"So, not really being a football fan, I really wanted to adventure into Friday Night Lights when it came out on TV. But I didn't. So the other day, when I saw it advertised on BestBuy for $14.99, I decided to buy it.

Should I start on why I don't really support high school football? It's not hate, it's just that it is not fair that when other sports (basketball, soccer, golf, tennis, track, hockey, well you get the idea) get better results than football, they are never recognized, plus, they are never really taken as 'seriously' as football...well, I don't think so.

I really, really wanted to watch this show (I really have no idea why), and even after watching the not so good (but not awful) pilot, I became in attached to it. I became caring about the injured player, about the annoying booster club guy, about Matt Saracen (the new QB one), about the coach, about the coach's wife, about Matt's grandma, about the love triangle...it's just a well produced teen drama. Yes, TEEN DRAMA. Heck, even the teens look like teens this time!

You just can't go wrong.

I think that if prices were always so low, more of us would experiment and get DVD sets of shows we wouldn't normally get. That would open us up to more novel and interesting viewing experiences, and we might discover some great gems in the process.

My note to studios - Please follow this lead and mark down your DVDs, please. DVDs are not too expensive to make, for years we have been ripped off by paying too much for it. I read on a forum recently that a 6-Disc DVD set would actually only cost about $8 to make (DVD cost included).

The direction of the show is great.  The photography is gritty and the acting is good.  The actors on the show has done a great job developing their characters.  The cheerleader character was generic and annoying, but I guess most cheerleaders in real life are.

Each character is on some sort of personal journey to be better people, though they often fall short due to their own humanity.

The results are sometimes mixed: Veronica Mars, I think, never quite deserved the hype, while I still wake up in the middle of the night, heart racing, realizing that I had a chance to watch Arrested Development while it was on the air and never did.

I have just completed the 1st season of Friday Night Lights on DVD. The series only gets better as it deepens and builds, but if you're wary, just try the first disc.  For me they were the best first 4 episodes of any TV show I've ever seen.

There are a lot of great shows, true, and I'm not going to say that this is the best, but other great shows never got off to a start like this, that I can remember. Buffy, The Wire, Battlestar Galactica, Six Feet Under, all wonderful programs in my opinion, and all took their time hitting their stride.

But right out of the gate, Friday Night Lights is a masterful portrait of small-town Americana, blending unbelievably resonant and emotional moments with nuanced and fully-realized character portraits that make this time and place come alive in a completely dimensional way that never cheats and never takes shortcuts.

Kyle Chandler, as the new headcoach of the Dillon, TX high-school football team and the wonderful Connie Britton as his wife anchor this story of dreams, and how mythologized a game can become until a team not just a team, but the ticket to realize the dreams of everyone even remotely connected to it (think of the role the Brooklyn Dodgers plays in the hearts of New Yorkers, and you'll be close).

A knowledge or love of football is not a prerequisite to watching this series, although you may just wince or cheer a little more during game scenes if you do know a thing or two.

But the show is not about football. It's about an America that we have not seen on television in some time. Every show on the air these days is about well-off people doing things not even remotely connected to a reality we can relate to in the least. Remember when a show like Roseanne actually showed an American family struggling to raise their kids and pay the bills? Friday Night Lights is about real people in an insular atmosphere that is not hopeless, but is often heartbreaking and crazy and joyous all at once.

Look, I'm doing my part. I'm telling you to watch a show most of you haven't watched and probably won't. But the new season starts this Friday, and it will so totally be cancelled if more people don't watch this year. Watch the first disc of the 1st season. Why not? Give it a try. If I convert one person, I've done something awesome for the day.",1191369600,4,2685,4.487704918032787
2866699,5,B000RF1QE2,"The show debuted last year to critical praises and rightly so, this is one of the best drama I have seen. It portrays a real gritty side to the whole high school experience which is usually glossed over by Hollywood.

When it came out on DVD, I bought it and wound up watching the whole season in only four days. Interestingly, contrary to the title, it isn't really a show about football. Rather, it is a show about a town and the people in it, their relationships and growing pains, set in a backdrop of high school football.  It is a great drama, which makes you really care for the characters. I started recommending this show to all of my friends. The most common resistance I hear is ""it looks like the OC or Dawson's Creek"" from my male friends, and ""it's a show only about football"" from females.

Simply put, this is the best TV show my wife and I have ever seen, or at least the best since that aborted semi-season of My So-Called Life.

Unbelievably good acting, incredibly understated but powerful writing (except for the absurd football scenes, but so what?), phenomenal music.  Just absolutely perfect, especially once they drop the annoying jittery cinema-verite stuff after the third epi.

2866713,5,B000RF1QE2,"Or a fan of Texas, for that matter.  WATCH THE SHOW ANYWAY.  It's that good.

That being said, this is not a show about football.  Like all of the most incredible tv, this show is about people - character-driven drama at it's absolute finest.  The boring, boooorrring pilot episode shows us each character as a stereotype - who we might see them as if we were, say, outsiders who might not think too highly of the pampered Texas football stars and the locals who have nothing better to do on a Friday night than go watch a high school football game.  And, frankly, you just won't give a darn.  (Although I'm a tv addict, even I fell asleep during the pilot.)

But then, each character grows.  And each character has such flaws.  And such conviction.  And you get to SEE them.  Really see them, and what you find is depth and strength and courage and weakness.  The show faces issues boldly without beating us over the head with them (race, gender, prejudice, rape, etc.), providing a forum to express the issues that Americans face everyday.  And though some of these issues are heavy, the tone of the show is one of strength in overcoming adversity.  Of challenges overcome and the power in forgiveness and in doing what is right rather than what is easy.  The team motto says it all:"" ""Clear Eyes.  Full hearts.  Can't lose.""",1189468800,6,1327,4.5508474576271185

I'm praying that NBC will not make the same mistakes that Fox has been known to do with their hit shows. Seeing the Friday night time slot doesn't give me much hope that many people will find this show next season.

The only real knock that I have for the first season is that towards the end it becomes quite obvious that the directors and writers had no idea if there would be a second season. These episodes seemed to try to hastily wrap up the entire series just in case there wouldn't be a next year.

Thankfully it looks like it'll be back. It is a shame summer is already over and NBC didn't take the opportunity to put this show on against the mindless drivel on every other channel.

2866720,5,B000RF1QE2,"In a weird bit of irony, NBC's hit tv series ""Heroes"" was released on DVD the same day as ""Friday Night Lights"", critically lauded but ratings challenged as many wondered whether it would even last longer than a season. While Heroes got all the attention (admittedly deservedly), this show was one of those cult shows that was little seen but praised and underrated by many. But usually this means that the show is the absolute best on TV and we all know it's simply personal preference so while the show does have some small flaws, they never overwhelm the show which is a nice plus.

Taking place in Dillon, Texas where the town's football team, the Panthers, is all the rage. But 2 new developments hit the town hard as a new coach is brought in, Eric Taylor, as well as the team's quarterback star Jason Street suffers an unfortunate accident leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Coach Taylor has to somehow bring his team back and make them faster and stronger with new quarterback, the confidence-lacking Matt Saracen. But of course, not everything is about football as everyone has their own issues to deal with such as affairs, drug taking, infights among the team as well as the town's bitterness towards the team should they lose. The team will have to muster everything they have as they make their way to the State Championships.

It's strange to have a show that's not built around a unique premise such as superpowers (Heroes), man vs machine (Battlestar Galactica) or mystery upon mystery (Lost). Instead, this is a show about football and the people affected by it so it's more character-driven rather than CG effects and action scenes. While it's a different change of pace, it's also great to see an emphasis on acting in realistic situations which helps since it has a really talented cast. From Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton playing the most realistic couple I've seen on TV to Minka Kelly, the sexy-but-smart Lyla Garrity and Tyra Collette who's not just a bad girl for the sake of being a *****. My one problem is a couple of characters such as ""Smash"" Williams who has an ego bigger than the field he plays in. Even though he gets more deeper storylines, he still feels like that arrogant kid we first see him being.

My other complaint is that the events that transpire within the episode are great filled with nuanced acting and believable situations but there are times you can't figure out where they were. While it's obvious some episodes like ""I Think We Should Have Sex"" where Taylor's daughter Julie says the episode title to her boyfriend, Matt the quarterback or ""Mud Bowl"" where the team plays on a homemade field but there are times where you remember a specific moment such as Lyla doing a bad*** moment at a car dealership or when Tyra goes after her mom's abusive boyfriend but you can't figure what episode these took place in. While it's obvious that the season arc, the team's struggle to get to State, is there but individual episodes might not have the weight of what came before it or afterwards.

With the extras being skimpy, a behind the scenes featurette and tons of deleted scenes for the episodes just feels light against at least a couple of commentaries and could've benefited from being a bit more heavier in the extras. But with its lovely music by band Explosions in the Sky, a talented cast and a premise that you don't have to love to get (I STILL don't know how the hell you play football), it's still a show you can enjoy.",1188691200,3,3490,4.651539708265802

This first season features excellent acting and some of the most compelling television available on network television.  The show revolves around a high school football team in the small town of Dillon, Texas.  The coach and central figure is varsity coach Eric Taylor, played by Kyle Chandler.  Coach Taylor's family is featured prominently, as the family is linked to each of the team's players and their families.

The first season features 22 episodes that introduce us to the trials and tribulations of the players, their families, and the football team.  I found myself standing up and rooting for the Dillon Panthers during game sequences as if I was watching a live game.  The scenes are that good.  Even though high school football is a central theme in the series, you do not have to be a sports fan to enjoy this series.

Fortunately the show has been renewed so that this DVD can be enjoyed along with new episodes.  Continuity is important in a series like this.

It stars the gorgeous Kyle Chandler (from Early Edition) who plays Eric Taylor, the newly appointed head coach to the high school in Dillon, Texas (Dillon High School Panthers) and Connie Britton (who I remember from Spin City) as his wife.
The show expands on the hit movie of the same name.  It focuses mainly on the team and the coach who is feeling the pressure of the town's pride and honor riding on his shoulders to make the team the best they can be and be successful.
I love the episode Best Laid Plans where Coach Taylor has to make his decision to maybe take another job and Jason moves into a new apartment and also Git'er Done where Jason is still unaware that his best friend is spending a lot of time with his girlfriend.
I love the theme of team spirit and pulling together as a team on their way to victory.  I love the characters and their relationships and the hope that the team gives to Dillon.

I feel that the writing is very realistic and truly draws you into the lives of these characters. The character of Tim Riggins, played by Taylor Kitsch has to be my favorite. The role is so well written and his quiet, yet intense performance allows you feel compassion towards his character. He is right on in his interpretation of the internal struggles of an alcoholic. Friday Night Lights became my favorite new show and I was able to see the earlier episodes online. I look forward to season two and highly recommend this DVD set. $19.99 is a steal!",1185926400,7,986,4.771929824561403
2866738,5,B000RF1QE2,"I was first introduced to FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS via the film starring Billy Bob Thornton which I loaned from a friend following his recommendation.  I wasn't particularly bothered about watching it (not being a big fan of American Football) however one night I thought `what the heck' and put it on.  I have to say I was completely surprised by the quality of the script and the acting.  I was intrigued to learn that a TV show had been produced as well and was about to air on ITV4 here in the UK.  I was interested to learn how they could turn the premise into a full length TV show, without it turning into the OC with football thrown in, so I thought I'd give it a go.

With the exception of both THE SHIELD and THE WIRE very few TV shows grip me from the first episode.  I have to say that I can now add FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS to that list.  The characters are well drawn and fleshed out, the cast are fantastic and all make you believe in the character they are portraying.

Both I and my friend have been strong advocates of this show, often mentioning it to work colleagues and friends alike in the same breath as THE SHIELD and THE WIRE.

Slowly, over the last few months, both critics and viewers in the UK have started to pick up on this little gem which is tucked away on Wednesday nights at 8pm here in the UK.

Without a doubt the best shows on TV are coming from the U.S. and this is certainly one of them.  Well done to NBC for renewing it for a second season!",1185235200,8,1471,4.162544169611308
2866739,5,B000RF1QE2,"I cannot believe I missed this show while it aired.  Instead I watched it online, which compromised the raw beauty of this gem. Luckily it is on DVD for a marathon re-watch.  I quickly learned that FNL is not a ""football show"" or ""a teen soap"".  This is an amazing show with great characters, true dialogue, and the humor and awkwardness of life.  The closest comparison I can think of is ""My So-Called Life"".  It is intimate and grand at the same time.  You won't easily forgot this show after you've seen it.  Give it 2 or 3 episodes and you'll be hooked.  I can't wait to see all the deleted scenes.",1184889600,5,602,4.3125
2866740,5,B000RF1QE2,"I've never posted a review before, but after today I felt compelled to write one. I saw that the Emmy nominations came out today, and was shocked to see that Friday Night Lights was left out of EVERYTHING!!! The acting and writing on this show are incredible. This show has moments in every episode that feel real and true, that make you actully think about issues and topics that face all of us at some point in our lives. Hopefully the ratings for the second season will be better and a ton of DVD sets will be bought, so that the show can continue on. $19.99 is a steal for this show, and I hope that people who did not watch the first season will buy it. I promise you will not be disappointed.",1184803200,5,698,4.2164179104477615

I didn't grow up in Texas, but I did grow up in a small town in Missouri, where the Friday night lights drew many to the stadium.  I had older brothers who had coaches who helped shape their lives.  Before I hated football, I loved it.  This series, and it's multidimensional characters, made me love it again.",1526688000,,390,4.7611940298507465

8200427,5,B000RF1QE2,"Friday Night Lights.... How did you and a BIG part of America miss it?
American Idol was on and everyone thought it was a H.S. football melodrama. It really was more of a Life is real in Texas show.
Yes cliches galore, however it's surrounded by More real life than cliches.
I am guilty of not watching when on TV however I binge watched every single episode and recorded every season when it was running on repeats.
Its nothing special that turns into a spectacular series.
I went on to see movie, read book and been to Texas 2 times (there is no Dillon Texas) anymore that is.
Some tid bits to make FNL fans smile and newbies say huh?
Connie Britton (Tammy Taylor)
Brad Leland (Buddy Garett) Only 2 actors to be in Both Movie and Series.
See Candy is owned by Warren Buffet",1524355200,,775,4.3517241379310345
