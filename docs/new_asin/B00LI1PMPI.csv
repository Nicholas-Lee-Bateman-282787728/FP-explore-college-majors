6487818,4,B00LI1PMPI,"First off this is directed and written by truly a visionary talent that I absolutely love behind the camera and also his writing talent. He is able to capture his actors and also create a feel that leaves lasting impressions upon the viewer. He is it stunning in creating and building up his characters and also the scenarios those characters are going through. Christophe Honore is a brilliant talented young fresh original and brilliant director, He has directed so many very stunning films such as 2006's Dan's Paris and 2007's Love Songs and 2009's Making Plans for Lena, just to name a few.

Just about every picture I see that he creates ends up leaving a lasting mark on my love affair of cinema. I was finally given the opportunity to watch this film titled, Man at Bath which was a 2010 film. What's interesting to note about this movie is this stars gay porn actor Francois Sagat. This would be his second main stream performance in a feature film. Now many diehard gay porn lovers will know him throughout many of his pornographic films probably most notably in the many Titan Media Porn Studio film. His first main stream film was in the 2010 violent and controversy L.A. Zombie. Now he did appear in another mainstream movie but really didn't act, he was just billed as the male addict in 2009's Saw VI. He is a very muscular, beautiful, sexy handsome looking man and he is very gifted and versatile in the sexual department and also acting. Very lustful, very eye candy-ish. Very manly man in the overall persona, specifically in the gay porn world. He is of French nationality. Most recently a model. Many will know him as a pornographic God to the fans of his appearances and abilities. Ultimately it was a treat to see him acting in this movie.

Your main character Emmanuel is a gay hustler who lives with his lover Omar. Both live in Paris. They fight and Emmanuel is heartbroken and has to basically strive for himself and on his own. Now Omar heads to Manhattan and the movie follows both men as they discover a new life and accepts on their challenges of breaking up and coming to terms with their current life settings. They have to ultimately find themselves again and both are having to struggle and find their ultimate stable in life.

6487819,3,B00LI1PMPI,"Hmmm.  Not porn, though many brief sex scenes.  Not drama, though there are snippets of stories.  Not much bath, either.  This is an odd film, showing a variety of people not necessarily having a relationship with one another.  The story line is not evident, nor is the point.  But still strangely mesmerizing.",1419292800,2,310,4.865384615384615
6487820,3,B00LI1PMPI,"Francois Sagat at his finest, i don't think his expression ever changes, if he's dancing around the house cleaning or if he's raping someone, kind of the same muscle brute persona with that odd hair helmet which seems spray painted on, even at close range. i'm pretty convinced  others in this movie, and they have precious little to do, were cast because they do not hold a candle looks wise to Francois, just messy haired French boys or women. I was particularly unconvinced when Francois is invited to a menage a trois and they ignore him. Too funny.",1418774400,6,553,4.642857142857143

6487825,2,B00LI1PMPI,"I wonder if this film is stereotypically French.  It has minimal sets and casting, yet may explore larger issues about the human condition.  Its point in saying the best guy for you may be the one that you are already with may resonate with many gay men in long-term relationships.  Nevertheless, I must agree that this film is just not particularly strong.
Franc,ois Sagat said that he stopped making porn years ago.  Well, this film may not help him get a bunch of non-porn roles.  (Ron Jeremy also pines for the day when he can get non-porn acting roles, but doesnt seem to understand that all those, limited, roles would go to Danny DeVito first.)  But look!: the very first image we see of Sagat is his firm, delicious, meaty, bucket-naked backside.  This film shows many images of him fully nude and thus tries to appeal to his physical sexiness from jump.  Dont get me wrong: at one point you see him in a pullover and jogging pants and his muscles still look savory.  This film is slightly shy of softcore and doesnt seem like a huge departure.
This work may be slightly derivative as well.  At one point, Sagat dances in close to no clothes.  This reminded me of Tom Cruises underwear dancing scene in Risky Business.  Sagats lover films much of the action here on a low-budget camera.  This visual perspective seems similar to the gay, French flick My Life on Ice.  Sagat blinds his lover with tape as they engage in sexual activity and that may harken back to 9.5 Weeks.  There are technical problems as well.  This film is supposed to take place in the US and France.  However, the spoken English language scenes were hard to hear.  Further, the film never had any French language music in it, just Anglophone stuff.
There were two times when a couple, one gay and one straight, were in coitus while a 3rd person was less than a few feet away watching.  I wonder if this is a shoutout or a slam against porn fans.  Franc,ois Sagat has swarthy skin and features, but plays a character with the Western name Emmanuel; his characters lover is paler but has the name Omar.  This couple is discrepant in another way: there is no way a man as beautiful as Franc,ois would get with the odd and plain-looking man that played his lover here.  I mean, he had nothing to be ashamed of down there, but he was no John Holmes, and he wasn't rich either.  Skeptical viewers will exclaim, Like Franc,ois has to settle for that!?!
Ive seen worse.  Further, should M. Sagat play another non-porn role, I might see it should I have the time and loot.  Nevertheless, this is no Color Purple!",1409702400,8,2583,4.526997840172786
6487826,2,B00LI1PMPI,"Boring and self important film with a fractured narrative and dialogue overly intent on persisting itself as philosophic or existential art. It's such a cliche on a shallow topic. I can't honestly review the film because after 20 mins I fast forwarded through the film just to see what happens.
There's potentially some worship of Sagats looks, even when the narrative deprecates him. I didn't feel a strong enough presence from him to buy in to the ""beauty isn't all there is"" slant. Granting the actor some leverage, I applaud Sagat's efforts to extend himself as an artist if only this piece weren't so uninteresting. The story line of the so called boyfriend in NYC was difficult to follow because the actor has such a different appearance I didn't realize it was his story. Many scenes there appear covertly filmed boring moments of which I never landed on one interesting moment.",1486598400,,885,4.867549668874172

I was unaware that he had moved form porn to other aspects of the film industry; but that's ok, I think there may be some potential for him in the right story. Unfortunately, the plot was hard to figure out and seemed just all over the place. But if your a fan of his, there's certainly enough here to keep you entertained.",1456617600,4,411,4.35064935064935
