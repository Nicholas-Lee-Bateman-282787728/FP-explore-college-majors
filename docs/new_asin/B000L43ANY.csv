8160225,2,B000L43ANY,Sub titles got in the way of watching the film. The film was not worth the money i spent to watch it.,1378944000,,101,3.6363636363636362
8160226,5,B000L43ANY,"Granted, I only bought this film because Emmanuelle Seigner is in it, but it turned out to be her best performance of the movies she has starred in during the 2000-2009 time-frame.  Yes, I categorize her works based on decades (1980-1989), (1990-1999), (2000-2009), (2010-present).  When she is cast in French films, she never fails to deliver and holds her own against any other actress you care to mention.

She plays a burnt out pop star superbly, and the story is not at all what I expected based on the trailer, cover, or even synopsis.  Very good examination of the relationship between her and the mentally imbalanced young girl who idolizes her to the point of obsession.  Surprisingly realistic, not the run-of-the-mill celebrity worship story with predictable events like you would see in US made films of this genre.

Emmanuelle Seigner is also one of the few actresses who can't help but remain pretty even when she is supposed to be ugly - a good thing, and not a comment on her acting ability at all as she is excellent.  She went on to further expand her career as a singer shortly after this film was made and had two albums (""Ultra Orange and Emmanuelle"" in 2006, and then later ""Dingue"" under her own name in 2010) - both are actually pretty good.

Now 47 years old, she is still sexier than most women half her age and is the very definition of a natural beauty.  If for no other reason, watch the film to see her.",1375056000,,1433,4.56640625
8160227,4,B000L43ANY,"A teen-age fan of a Madonna-eque pop star ends up befriending the star, and before long all sorts of boundaries
start getting crossed.  Picture a dash of ""All About Eve"", a little of Altman's  ""3 Women"", and mix in some ""Almost
Famous"" and you have some of the feel of this dark, but fun brew.

Terrific performances by the two protagonists - Emmanuelle Seigner as the singer, Islid Le Besco as her obsessed
teen protg drive the film, making scenes that could have seemed ridiculous ring oddly true, if strange.

Not everything works.  Among other things the singer's music feels far too cute and generic to drive the kind of
dark obsession we see.  And some twists stretch credulity or reason at moments.  But if Bergman had directed
""About Famous"" we might have gotten something a little like this heady mess of sexuality, loss of self, obsession,
complex familial relationships being created and destroyed, loss of innocence, etc. etc.",1363305600,,938,4.861635220125786
8160228,5,B000L43ANY,"Fascinating drama about a megastar pop singer and one of her obsessed fans. Casting is perfect in this film, Seigner and Le Besco are wonderful and really pull you into the drama. Definitely raw and challenging, but great cinema. There is a fairly important character decision that seemed a little surprising to me, one I've had a hard time accepting even on a second viewing. It provides the final drama, but it is the only flaw in an otherwise strong film.",1320364800,,458,4.666666666666667
8160229,5,B000L43ANY,A great film. Isled le Besco and Seigner are so fascinating to watch. I love this film.,1268265600,,87,4.176470588235294
8160230,5,B000L43ANY,"I loved the film---some great acting turns, especially by the young lady in the lead.  I could feel the intensity of her emotion!  It's been many years since I had a hopeless crush on a celebrity (and never to this degree), but I felt like I was going through this experience with Lucie, feeling her love, longing, pain, disappointment, and devotion.

That said, beware! This film is NOT widescreen, and the transfer is terrible, from a dirty and scratched film.  Chopping the sides of the film off also cut off part of the burned-in subtitles.  This wonderful film deserves a better presentation!",1255132800,5,597,4.813725490196078
8160231,4,B000L43ANY,"I'm no liitle girl, rather a 57 year old male -a physician and surgeon,
and I was very much impressed by this gem when it aired recently on Sundance. I was hoping to download its signature song here, ""Je ne partirai pas ce soir"" (unsuccessfully) when I came across the first and only review. It helps to know French, I suppose, but it is a fine film indeed and I enjoyed it immensely ... despite my age and sex.",1238198400,5,411,4.215189873417722
