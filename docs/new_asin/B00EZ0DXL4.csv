5957427,5,B00EZ0DXL4,"The third series in this intense and engrossing drama begins slowly; then the dramatic tension evolves. Personal problems and lives are not ignored, but are included as subplots without distraction from the political tale. One could not imagine that Danish politics could be so engrossing; but, there are universal dilemmas which arise from the ambitions and personalities of the participants. The acting, direction, and production are first rate!",1392681600,2,447,5.588235294117647

5957429,4,B00EZ0DXL4,I have  seen all 3 seasons on TV. It is one of the best TV series about the political arena.  I wanted to share it with friends so purchased both Seasons 1 and 2 this past summer. I have a big question. Are there English subtitles on Season 3.?The information lists only Danish subtitles. I want to purchase Season 3 . However it must have English subtitles. Could one of the reviewers please let me known here.,1390953600,,411,4.324675324675325
5957430,5,B00EZ0DXL4,"Borgen is so wonderful and Sidse Babette Knudsen is beyond praise.

If this actress had been born in London or New York, she would be as famous as Helen Mirren or Meryl Streep.

We have to ration ourselves to keep from watching all of it in one long blast of pleasure. I can't imagine an intelligent, thoughtful person who wouldn't like Borgen. NB: our young Lab is also fascinated by it.",1390694400,20,388,4.450704225352113
5957431,2,B00EZ0DXL4,"Unreflective of inspiration that animated seasons one and two, which soared with stellar creativity, originality, and excellence in acting. I adored them and was saddened that season three fell so flat.",1390176000,3,202,5.548387096774194
5957432,4,B00EZ0DXL4,"i personally found a lot of the magic gone in this show after the first two seasons. in this season, our lead character wants to found her own party. the logistics of this is gone into great detail and if you love politics, this may be seen as an improvement by you. it led to quite a few boring moments for me including several shows about the Danish pork industry. jasper now works on tv in the news and has had a kid with the blonde newscaster.  she has gone to work for the new political party. although this is more interesting drama, there is a hole in the plotline. for two seasons jasper was given to us as the tormented son of a pedophile father who endured horrific incest. in the third season, jasper is presented as newly single again and having a complete stable of women going in and out of his bachelor pad.  this is an incredibly unlikely result for a victim of pedophile incest from his father.  that he has fathered a son in a heterosexual marriage after that is quite a stretch as to credibility but the other verges on the impossible.  too bad because jasper was the best character on the show as a political spin doctor who was a secret victim of the worst child abuse. much better is the male tv newscaster who ends up with an American style producer who wants his news show to stop being such a downer and start delivering happier news.  this portion of the show was terrific.  all in all it was still much better than your average tv fodder but fell from its former lofty position.

5957433,5,B00EZ0DXL4,"I watched Seasons 2 and 3 on PBS, left a rave review of Season 2.  Some of what I said about Season 2 applies to Season 3 as well, e.g., BORGEN having the perfect balance of the interpersonal and the political, public and private. I can't think of another show that more deftly illustrates the impact of political discourse on people's lives, and vice-versa, and it does so every week in a way that consistently delivers a POWERFUL punch both intellectually and emotionally. The camerawork is phenomenal, so intimate, pulls you right in.

I love the subtitles, obviously done by non-Native English speakers, e.g., ""Hey- those are just the perps that come with the job..."" [percs], ""you need the pressure of the right people"" [support], ""so"" substituted for ""but"", compassionate for sympathetic, etc., just slightly off, charming. As with British shows (such as the Irish crime-drama Single-Handed- Season 1&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Natural-Justice/dp/B004RZV4PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Natural Justice</a>, another favorite, available with Prime), Danish TV doesn't censor obscenities, interesting to hear four letter expletives in Danish. It's often obvious what's being said from the inflection, even through they're blanked out in the subtitles for American TV.

Another aspect I find intriguing is the depiction of government on a much smaller scale. One soldier killed in Afghanistan produces a national outcry. In one episode the prime minister's kids were upset with her for not cooking dinner. Birgitte washes her own dishes, tries to unstop the kitchen sink, and cleans the house, but also flies to Africa to broker peace talks.

I have family in England, and BORGEN well illustrates the close ties and interdependency of EU nations and people, quite foreign (literally) to our insular way of thinking. Similarly, American politics and the media are so polarized, polarizing, it's refreshing in the extreme to see a story that shows conflicting, and yet well-fleshed out, comprehensible points of view. Everyone's human, fallible, sure, but it's not as simple as good guys vs. bad guys. Not to go off on a tangent, but for example, animal-lovers in America often villainize hunters- yet I've read that hunters have done more to safeguard animal habitats and preserve more species than any other group in America (starting with Charles Audubon, an avid hunter). BORGEN takes the time to paint people and issues in relatively fine brushstrokes.

I said of Season 2 that I loved the interplay between the personal and the political. Another reviewer thought it too personal, not political enough.  Season 3 focused much more on the political, less on the personal, and I found that equally satisfying, perhaps even more so.  The politics, the nuts and bolts of forming a new political party, and all the machinations and strategizing relating thereto was absolutely fascinating.  ***SPOILER ALERT***  What personal themes there were were handle with great subtlety, e.g., Birgitte's new romance, her health problems, Katrine's new relationship, Torben's personal and professional challenges...they didn't detract a bit from the political intrigue.

I've just seen Episode 1 of Season 1 on PBS (they're starting over), I can hardly wait to see the rest of Season 1 [see FINAL UPDATE at end]. Having seen seasons 2 and 3, the most obvious difference is Birgitte's lack of self-confidence.  Other things I want to mention: 1) unisex bathrooms (with stalls) in Denmark, no-one bats an eye;  2) people smoke, even at work;  3) there isn't such an emphasis on thin, young, gorgeous actresses, women look normal, have meat on their bones, are sans make-up at home (Katrine doesn't even wear makeup to work, only when she's going to be on camera), pad around with cellulite showing, and women of all ages, with normal wrinkles, are shown.  Also, women don't look like they were produced by a cookie cutter with the same hair styles, tight clothing, stiletto heels, no cosmetically enhanced breasts in sight, such a nice change from American productions (ditto for the men, they look real), 4) everyone rides bikes to work, even heads of political parties, and finally 5) the Danish use the terms ""welfare"" and ""welfare programs"", with their original meanings, as we used to, meaning for people's betterment, for the improved, enhanced quality of people's lives, no negative connotations.

I find BORGEN captivating, fascinating on many levels.  I love the tension and dynamism between the press and politicians.  A favorite character is the news chief of TV1, Torben Friis, phenomenal, another is marvelous Hanne Holm.  Actually, there's not a character on the show who's not richly drawn, superbly acted, I wish I could mention them all (Hesselboe, Kasper, Pia, Bent, Philip, Svend, Ulrik, Laura, Magnus, Jeremy, everybody).  Most of all, I love Birgitte, and her integrity.  Though hardly perfect, she wrestles with what the ethical course is, and for her ends don't justify the means.  Every week there's a famous quote that embodies the theme of that show.  One of them was from Abraham Lincoln, who said (I paraphrase): Most men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him POWER.  That sensibility informs the entire show.  The writing, the acting, the direction is as good as it gets, for me, just wonderful.  I plan to buy the entire series.

UPDATE: Having now watched all three seasons, my admiration has grown exponentially, the circle complete (symbolized by Hanne's crooked scarf before her TV1 broadcast from Borgen in Episode 1, and again, straightening it before going on the air live from Borgen in the final episode).

I'm now in even GREATER awe of Season 3, culminating in the final episode- for me, the series's crowning achievement, the piece d'resistance.  It means much, much more after seeing how it all began, the complete journey.  Episode 30 is studded with magic moments.  I won't list them all, but among them are Birgitte's final doctor's visit, Jeremy accompanying her to Borgen, Philip and Jeremy's bittersweet meeting, Katrine finally finding her man, Torben finding his voice (and where his heart lies), the suspense surrounding the formation of the new government, and most of all, how Birgitte, when faced with the toughest decisions of her life, shows her mettle by putting her country's interests ahead of her own.  Simply SPLENDID, inspiring, the arc of her growth, as well as that of the series, now complete.  One of the BEST TV series EVER.",1387324800,38,6562,5.22

5957435,4,B00EZ0DXL4,"Season 3 of Borgen was good but not as strong as the first 2.  Without spoiling anything for people who've never seen the show, the ending of season 2 creates a big change for the major characters of the show.  Season 3 picks up a few years after that and while it was interesting to see how the show turned out, I can't say I agree with the outcome.  Borgen is a fantastic show throughout, I just wish the magic of the first two seasons was carried over to season 3.  I give a huge amount of respect to the creators of the show for realizing the show had hit it's peak and not carry it on and on like they do here in the states.",1385078400,11,629,3.9682539682539684

5957453,1,B00EZ0DXL4,"People jumping in and out of bed. Parents divorced. Kids left to take care of themselves when not shuttled between strangers, grand parents, parents, or whomever is around to watch them. It is only fitting that the reporter, Katrina's, last scene is of her without her little kid. And of course it is only fitting that the father and ex-husband of Birgitte Nyborg shows up to met her new bed mate while fathering/mothering the kids as she wheels and deals in the government games. People having affaires at the office. Men who wear high heels. Weak male characters that whimper, cave in, and run out on their families or just collide into someone for a few minutes since most aren't strong enough to handle a family is the best male role model you get here. Mother and daughter talk where the mother and daughter giggle about the mom having an affaire with the neighbor. The only time God is mentioned is when they use his name as a curse word. The conservatives are mocked, vilified. Traditional Danes are ridiculed as silly and irrelevant. Bringing in outsiders seems to be of utmost importance to this group although they don't seem to hide their awareness of the differences. I guess the ""we are still in charge"" attitude hasn't been debunked just yet. Arguing over the differences between a ""street walker"" and a prostitute in determining that prostitution should be legal. Introducing your kids to men who fly in once in a while to share your bed only after you have cemented that he gets lonely on the road and frequents prostitutes. Propping up a political system that gives more power to the politicians than it does the voter. Yes, Shakespeare was correct something IS rotten in Denmark. I have a feeling that the ending to this series and season was fudged a little. If they truly wanted to show politicians in their truest form and stay true to their heroine they would have stayed true to the leading character instead of turning her into a some women's movement role model with ""morals"". She would have taken that PM job without hesitating. We all know it. She knows: if Birgitte Nyborg could talk on her own she would have pulled out another great fete against the writers of this series this time by forming a gov with the group giving her PM. She is nothing more than a power hungry beast dressed in a women's suit carefully bobbing up and down on her high heels. This was a series about a lot of selfish soulless beings. I don't even think they are still part of the human race.",1423958400,,2496,4.61123595505618

Borgen failed to tick any of those boxes and remained gripping, vivid, real, exciting and authentic until the end.  Well, 97% of the time.  Birgitte is sensational, so is Katrine, as the 2 main female characters, and the combination of politics, media, and personal lives of the main players gives a wonderful insight into facets of issues which affect our lives.

5957495,5,B00EZ0DXL4,"The series is often referred to as the ""Danish version of West Wing.""  But aside from a few pious-sounding speeches in the opening episode of Season One that seems to echo the feel-good themes from Aaron Sorkin's West Wing scripts, this series is far more nuanced in its characterizations of the lives of the main characters, both personal and professional.  You identify with them as real people, and the specific themes of Danish political, economic and cultural life are close enough to our own for American audiences to identify with.",1405555200,2,538,4.966666666666667

5957516,5,B00EZ0DXL4,"BORGEN is back! The third and final season of this brilliant Danish political series is one of the most anticipated DVD releases of 2014 for fans of top quality drama.

Season Three is set two and a half years after the end of Series Two. Birgitte Nyborg is no longer prime minister and a number of relationships from the previous two seasons have changed dramatically. Most significantly, star journalist Katrine (Birgitte Hjort Sorensen) is still working at the TV station and has had a child with Kasper Juul (Pilou Asbaek), with whom she got together at the end of Season Two, although they are soon separated. Her balancing of motherhood with career is one of the main story lines in Season Three. This develops even further when she quits her job to work with Birgitte as Birgitte re-enters the world of politics.

Another switch is less focus on Kasper Juul (who is now a secondary character) and more emphasis on Torben Friiss (Soren Malling), the head of the top TV station known for its exemplary coverage of politics. Torbens story arc is fascinating to watch as he is forced to deal with a young, trendy new boss who is more interested in ratings than news. Kasper is seen initially clean-shaven and with longer, tousled brown hair, a stark contrast from his buzz cut and stubble beard which helped give him his haunted-by-personal-demons look in the previous two series

With Birgitte out of office, the logical question remains: When/if will she get back in? Her return to politics is at the heart of episode one and is what hooks the viewer back into the series.

The next two episodes focus on Birgittes failure to be welcomed back to her former party. The solution? Create a new party. This is where Season Three really takes off. The formation of the party gives us more of an understanding of Birgittes personal integrity. For example, she will not accept desperately needed donations to her party if there is the slightest hint of promises to the donor. The founding of the New Democrat party and Birgittes straightening out of its principles take up episodes two and three with the requisite development of the key relationships, as well.

The middle episodes see the New Democrats struggling to win public support as they weigh in on some issues of the day while continuing their commitment to political integrity. Issues like the ethical treatment of animals and issues surrounding sex trade workers are hot button contemporary concerns. BORGEN handles them fairly and in such a skilled way that the viewer is drawn into the wheelings, dealings and compromises that are at the heart of modern-day politics.

Then, while the New Democrats seem to be making great progress with public opinion, Birgitte is dealt a stunning blow to her health which she insists on handling on her own. Will her stubbornness topple her house of cards? Or does she find her way out of this set-back as well? It isn't easy for BIrgitte to admit to any form of weakness. Pride goeth before the fall?

The balance of the episodes remind us that relationships and politicking- is what we love about BORGEN. The politics are intriguing, the relationships keep the intrigue personal.

Birgittes illness, dramatically speaking, is a brilliant touch, a reminder that nothing is more humbling than our own bodies when they fail us in some way. Even after she finally allows her family in on her secretwhich her doctor strongly recommends for the sake of her recoverythere are still challenges to be overcome, adding to the dramatic narrative, especially as election day creeps closer. Tensions mount, involving betrayal, desperation and illicit affairs. The deceptions cause more than one breakdown.

A more critical eye might find flaws where Ive found none. Truth be told, Ive been swept up in this magnificent series since the beginning. It is astonishing that BORGEN simply gets better and better.",1397433600,11,3893,4.9132420091324205
5957517,5,B00EZ0DXL4,"Experience the political drama of a Danish coalition government. It's been called the West Wimg of Denmark, but it is so much more. Fantastic acting and writing.",1397347200,,161,5.0
5957518,4,B00EZ0DXL4,"I liked Borgen, respected it, enjoyed it. But I didn't LOVE it, as opposed seemingly everyone in the universe (OK I found one Luke-warm review out of about 20 by major outlet writers - the rest were flat out raves). My wife loved it. My friends. So maybe I need to see it again? But 30 hours is a big investment in something that didn't blow me out of my chair.

It's about Danish politics, and the almost accidental rise of one woman - Brigitte Nyborg - a member of one of Denmark's 8 parties to the role of Prime Minister  after her less- pragmatic, better known male rivals self-destruct. It followers her, and those around her -- her team, the press, her political rivals -- as they try to stay balanced in the always choppy and morally confusing world of politics.

There's no question the show is extremely well acted. And the characters cover a wide range of jobs, temperaments, levels of honesty and ethics, while almost all remaining human beings (I do wish the leader of the far right party wasn't quite such a cartoon). The human problems the lead character faces as the pressure of high office takes its tolls on both her family and her ethics are believable and moving. And I loved that all the major characters are allowed to be flawed and make bad decisions while still being treated as decent people at heart.

Yet, for me there was something a bit too neat, a bit too old-school in the show's 'crisis of the week' approach, where almost every episode sometimes wildly complex political issues and situations manage to get resolved. While the personal issues are allowed to work in a more serialized way, evolving slowly over time, I don't love how the show pushes to close the book on a brand new political crisis almost every episode. It leads the show to need sudden convenient twists that can feel melodramatic at times, and sometimes makes our heroine just a little too perfect, a little too much smarter than everyone in the room for me to buy it.

Warning: mild, general spoilers for the 3rd season ahead

In the series' 3rd (and last) season, there was, for me, some compromise of what had seemed the show's own moral core. While I applaud the idea -- so lost in the US -- that effective politics is largely about pragmatism and compromise, in the show's 3rd season it starts to feel like Brigitte has become ALL about pragmatism and compromise to get what she wants , and that the show itself isn't seriously challenging her shift. Without some ideological, moral core I found it harder to care who won out. There is a clever last second reprieve that eases the problem to a certain extent. But I spent a lot of the last season feeling increasingly uncomfortable that the series itself DIDN'T seem to be uncomfortable as it's heroine increasingly seemed a woman whose talents were exploiting the political machinery as an end in itself -- without deeply, critically questioning her character, or making us face the intriguing but uncomfortable possibility that perhaps she isn't the truly good hearted, nobly intended politician we all wished for, and that she had always seemed to be.

None-the-less, a LOT is good in the show, and given it's near universal enthusiastic embrace (and the fact I certainly quite liked it, even if I didn't love it) I may just be forced to hang onto my blu-ray set, and one day give it another go.",1397260800,,3354,4.6268907563025214
5957519,5,B00EZ0DXL4,"Borgen is still THE BEST OF THE BEST! Speaking honestly, of all the films and TV shows I've seen,
the superb Danish series Borgen stands out as the absolute best. Having just finished watching Season 3 for the second
time, I can easily say that the creators (all exceptionally talented, including the actors, directors, producers, writers, editors,
photographers, composers) managed to sustain the exquisite quality throughout. Sidse Babett Knudsen deserves widespread
recognition for her fantastic performance; in fact, there isn't one actor in Borgen who isn't pitch perfect. Also, the sensitivity, astute
observation, wisdom, and kindness that pervade the script blew me away. I feel very grateful to the creators of this

Sidse Babette Knudsen (Birgitte Nyborg) proved herself to be one of Denmarks finest actors but I must say all the actors gave breathtaking performances.

5957524,5,B00EZ0DXL4,"My favorite television program series was Breaking Bad until I watched Borgen and I now favor Borgen slightly even
though it's sub-titled from Danish to English. I could relate much more to the human interactions that take place in
Borgen as I have personally experienced some of the events portrayed and it was as though I could feel the actors
joy and/or pain from my own past experiences or past experiences from friends and loved ones.
It touched me several times and I looked forward to each episode and am sorry it didn't continue beyond the three seasons.
It is political in nature which turns some people off and it's sub-titled which turns more people off but the writing and acting
trump those two negatives and it will capture your heart as it did mine. Give it a look, you will be surprised at how captivating
it is. The casting couldn't be better and the acting is every bit as good as Breaking Bad.",1395532800,,912,4.567073170731708

5957529,4,B00EZ0DXL4,"Coming back to Borgen after a year's lapse, I was so looking forward to it. As the Series 3 started, I was let down a bit. Episode one was exciting as we were introduced to Birgitte Nybirg as a woman on the move, sort of a roving CEO, making lots of money giving speeches, living in luxurious spaces. Then, we got to episode two, and what was Nyborg going to do. We meet all of the characters again, and are introduced to new ones. Husband number one is gone forever as a husband, but they are good friends. What I found that was with the parents who were separated or divorced,the child care was pretty much split. Good for Denmark!

We find out at the beginning that two and a half years have lapsed. The children look older, but not the main characters. Katrine Fonsmark, who plays Hjort Sorenson is a TV news anchor, seems to like it, but with her child now becoming a toddler, she may change horses in mid stream. Nyborg is drawn back into politics, she just can't stand what is happening to her country. However, no party really wants her, so she starts her own. Here is where we meet the rest of the characters, and the ten episodes are well drawn together with exciting and informative situations. The characters who had dropped out of the series because of divorce or ill-health, are welcomed back. Everything is different and yet it seems the same.

Nyborg has a boyfriend from the UK, played by Alastair Mackenzie, and she speaks English only, when she is with him. That was the most noticeable change of all. Excellent English, by the way, with only a trace of an accent. Each episode as I said introduces a new situation, ill health, new elections, lovers come and gone, but always they revolve around politics!

This was a great season, it provided everything I needed for a finish. Kudos.
