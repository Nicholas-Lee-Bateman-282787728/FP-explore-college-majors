331697,3,6301474961,"(previous film ""Godzilla's Revenge"")
Summary:  Godzilla must fight to protect the citizens of Japan from the terrifying, pollution-spawned monster Hedorah!
The 11th, and certainly strangest/wildest, entry in the original Showa series of G films is truly an ode to the '70s, complete with Japanese hippies, sexy go-go dancers, out-of-this-world animation segments, discotheques and an all important ""Be Kind to the Environment"" storyline/message.  And who can forget the ultra groovy theme song ""Save the Earth"", as heard in the original English dubbed version!!  We're really talking WILD here, man!!
This G film, along with ""Godzilla Raids Again"", is by far the hardest of all G movies to find on video, so if you're a fan you definitely need to pick this one up if given the opportunity to do so ... you'll really be missing out on a truly wild G rush if you don't!!

331698,2,6301474961,"These are the movies that try men's souls.  The Godzilla series was at or near the bottom of the barrel with this flick.  Some feel that dubious distinction was reached with ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" or maybe the juvenile ""Godzilla's Revenge.""  A giant blot of industrial waste has a life of its own.  It flies through the air, and spreads more pollution in its wake.  At one point, it attaches itself to a giant smokestack and inhales the belching smoke and fumes.  That may appear benevolent, but the end result is more filth in the environment.  Godzilla decides to battle the giant whatever-it-is and save the Earth.  The special effects of low budget Japanese sci-fi flicks are an inside joke that continues to amuse, regardless.  This is the film where we see Godzilla use his heat ray as a jet propulsion device.  Yep, he actually flies through the air like a jet plane.  One could take the film as a live action spoof of a Bob Clampitt cartoon, but that is a stretch.  The filmmaker's warning of the danger of uncontrolled pollution may resonate with very young children.  Anyone over the age of five is on their own.  ;-)",1014163200,3,1127,4.626262626262626

You gotta rent this, buy it, or whatever you gotta do, but you gotta watch it somehow. It's a very fun (and funny) movie about polution.",1010534400,,275,4.411764705882353
331700,5,6301474961,Godzilla was great in this movie. He teaches us not to be so wastfull and not to polute our land .Because IT can turn on us and destroy the world .Godzilla teaches us to clean up and be kind to nature. When nature turns on the humans. I realy hope we are ready .,996451200,3,262,3.8703703703703702

7812107,5,6301474961,"Talk about your deja-vu! This VHS is a very good copy (even for a used cassette) which plays to perfection on one's VCR. It includes the ORIGINAL English-dubbed voices from AIP, including Adryan Russ' 'Save The Earth' song at the beginning, something of which most Godzilla fans remember & enjoyed back in the day when WOR-9 used to show this movie the day after Thanksgiving in the 1980s. If you want to re-live those good times exactly as you recall them, this VHS is for you!",1403136000,,478,4.569767441860465
7812108,4,6301474961,This one was a hit in America even back in the seventies as Godzilla fights a pollution spewing smog monster.  It is as good as any in the series.  And it's' dubbed of course. Whiy it's not on dvd or even blu ray yet is beyond me.  The vhs tape has the terrible quality of a vhs tape and it's not widescreen. vhs tapes sucked but that is all you can buy here. Someone needs to get this and all the Godzilla movies out on blu ray.,1401840000,,429,3.9080459770114944
7812109,2,6301474961,The VHS tape does not work properly.  It will play normally for 30 seconds then vertically skip for 30 seconds throughout entire film.  Tracking does not fix the problem.,1253145600,,170,4.827586206896552
7812110,2,6301474961,"Actually this movie is very rare and its OOP i can see why
because this G flick is very horriable. For one where in hell
did the director go with this story and who wrote this?Its
about some pollution monster name hedorah that pollutes the earth
and godzilla fights it to protect the earth. The only good thing
about this movie is the end monster action because it seems
in my point of view hedorah was actually beating up godzilla
not until the humans intefering with their project they were
using to defeat it. But over all i give this a two star because
this monster G flick was pretty bad but if you haven't watch it
go ahead and watch and you may like it better then me. Im a huge
G fan and i was really disappointed in the movie as well the
director and producers.",1079740800,,770,4.20945945945946
7812111,3,6301474961,"I am still trying to decide if the person who made the decision to translate ""Gojira tai Hedora"" as ""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster"" was a total idiot or a genius.  Certainly this is a title that stops and makes you take notice, but it is not exactly descriptive.  Hedora spews forth poisonous gas rather than being made of smog; after all it is hard to wear a suit and play a monster made out of smog.  My first thoughts were that just as Godzilla (with Haruo Nakajima in the rubber suit this time around) was created by atomic explosions, Hedora (Kenpachiro Satsuma) would be created by pollution.  But then someone in the film claims Hedora hails from a galaxy far, far away and comes here on a meteor, where he feeds on pollution. Take you pick; two origins for the price of one.  Hedora might even be an answer to one of humanity's growing problems except for the aforementioned poisonous gases he keeps emitting.  Besides, Godzilla is already using his radioactive breath to burn away sludge in the water and none of the scientists seem particularly upset about this.
""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster"" is pure formula from Toho Studio, which means we have seen this before and done better (although there is something to be said for the inherent silliness of a film like this).  We have the small boy, Ken (Hiroyuki Kawase), who loves Godzilla.  We have the Japanese scientists all concerned with the ecological disasters afflicting their nation who are suddenly confronted with a monster that manifests their concerns.  Godzilla shows up for a quick battle and easily dispatches Hedora, who licks his wounds, eats more garbage, and comes back stronger than ever.  In fact, Hedora can now fly.  If you think that is something, wait until you see Godzilla uses his radioactive breath to fly as well in the climatic battle sequence.  As for the Japanese flower children taking their hallucinogenic drugs in this 1971 film, the less said about them, the better, although it does provide a clue as to the weird little bits of animation that pop up in this film.
This is probably the worst of the Godzilla films, which gives it an inherent appeal.  ""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster"" is exactly the tacky Japanese rubber suited monster movie that you want to make fun of from start to finish.  It would be perfect in that regard if only the dubbing was off some more.  Besides, Godzilla flies.  Do you really want to go your entire life without seeing that particular bit of celluloid history?",1039305600,5,2488,4.711316397228638
7812112,5,6301474961,"Most people don't understand how Godzilla films became so campy in the '60s and '70s. As a long-time fan, I can admit that some of these films were hard to stomach (Megalon and Gigan, I'm talking to you) and some are just weird (Godzilla vs the Sea Monster). But Godzilla vs the Smog Monster (a.k.a. Hedorah) gives us a rare peak into the late-60's Tokyo scene: go-go dancers, tight pants, wakka-chakka pop music, and groovy hair styles...what a happenin' place to be! This is a Godzilla movie with an enviro-political message: get rid of pollution before it gets rid of you! The Smog Monster is created from Man's own industrial waste. Godzilla is awakened, presumably by the screaming citizens on the mainland, and proceeds to open up a Fuji-sized can of whupass on the ever-changing Hedorah. Sure it's campy, but the average audience member back then was a 13-year old boy. So sit back and enjoy it. I like mine extra campy, with a little cheese on the side.",1034985600,11,961,4.6923076923076925
