8267863,5,B0017ZCUQY,"I was a devout Latter-Day Saint from birth to 18-yrs old.  I was baptized, confirmed, went to the temple, baptized for the dead (something I still feel uncomfortable about), received a patriarchal blessing, everything up to serving a mission.  Despite all of this devoutness, I always had my deep concerns about the church.  Something just never sat right with me.  I was never vocal about it, fearful of the consequences that come with having an opposing view in this church.  At 18-yrs old, I became inactive; more of a rebellious choice than anything.

Anyway, to the point!  I watched only the part about Bill's involvement with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. After I watched this, I can tell you without a doubt that what Bill says about The Mormons is stop-on accurate! There were somethings that he states that I was unaware of.  So I went to the source.  I asked my old bishop, my family who remains in the church and all of them reacted with the same kind of hush-hush response which only caused me to suspect that what Bill states in undoubtedly true. I urge Mormons both active, and inactive to watch this.  You won't go to Hell for renouncing a heavily Masonic and Necromantic society who's doctrine is based on nothing that can be archeologically proven and forged by the pressing of The United States government.",1308960000,11,1344,4.705128205128205
8267864,1,B0017ZCUQY,"After watching this series of films, I'm convinced Schnoebelen is either certifiably insane, or a liar on par with Baron Mnchhausen. Maybe a little of both? Either way it certainly is a prime example of irresponsible film production.

OK, I was loaned the set of films by a friend, and made it about half-way through before I couldn't take it anymore (Plus my laundry was done! LOL!)! I admit I did cheat and go fairly close to the end though, as I wanted to hear him with my own pair of ears come out and admit that he was indeed a blood sucking for reals vampire. For doing that much, I was not disappointed.

For the most part, the movies (at least for what I saw of them) were an anti-Masonic/anti-Catholic rant, and trying to tie it all into part of a world wide satanic conspiracy. For example, he makes the claim that the Pope is a Mason and may very well be a closet satanist. *sigh* I suppose since Schnoebelen has close ties to Jack Chick, I shouldn't be surprised. That aside, he makes quite a number of really bizarre claims such as:

1. A trip to the planet Saturn for some kind of an initiation. More accurately a black moon orbiting Saturn with a structure on it that just happened to look like the Denver Airport, only it was all black and had pustules on the surface. Furthermore claims there was a crater in his front yard from his return... his mom and dad saw it. Yes, really.

2. H.P. Lovecraft's writings were based upon reality.

3. Living in a haunted house that would make the Amityville Horror look mild in comparison.

4. Claims to have talked to Satan on several occasions.

5. The reason for the problem for child molestation in the Catholic church is that many Catholic priests are also satanic priests (he claims being a Catholic priest is a requirement), and that is part of their rituals.

I mean this is on top of his claims of being a vampire amongst other things, and it just goes on and on. Thing that really bothers me is that he offers all of this with absolutely no shred of evidence. None! Zero! Zip! Nada!

What I really find amusing though is that in spite of his allegations of being in the deep end of the pool so to speak as far as his involvement in satanism, he still maintains that he was this nice guy that wouldn't harm a fly. Seriously... he claims that while there were all these other colleagues that were making human and animal sacrifices, all he ever did was sacrifice a hamster, and to this day he feels bad about that. Give me a fraking break!

Thing is, doing the research into his background, and one can't help ask themselves what this guy isn't an ""expert"" in? There are some very credible sources out there that cast some serious doubts as to his time line, credentials, and just how deep he ever really got into any of this material. Case and point is that he became a born again while continuing to practice Freemasonry, Wicca, and Mormonism for quite some time afterwards according to his very own claims. It certainly leaves one to wonder what exactly his real agenda is.

Verdict? At best these films are good for a few laughs for those who can see through the baloney... figure any poor sap willing to plunk down their money for this garbage deserves at least that much. Otherwise save yourself the trouble.",1243814400,14,3277,4.454090150250417
