6603824,5,B00MWVRWYC,A very short movie with a heart-warming ending and message of faith.....the little shepherd boy's dad was a shepherd at the birth of the Christ-child and has subsequently died in a boulder accident. Good acting......,1418169600,5,216,5.2
6603825,5,B00MWVRWYC,"Excellent short film for the whole family to enjoy! It will surely strengthen your testimony of our Savior, a great reminder for Christmas and anytime of the year!",1417478400,8,163,4.857142857142857
6603826,1,B00MWVRWYC,"This brief film seemed like a good idea to get in the Christmas mood but to me it really just came off as poorly executed Bible fan fiction. The acting is terrible and that is probably mostly due to the lines in the script being written in a terrible style that makes it impossible to deliver the lines in a natural way. The story is completely apocryphal. Deep down it has a good message but you'll have to be really forgiving to enjoy this film. The kids seemed to like it, I guess, and maybe that is the intended audience.",1417478400,3,525,4.26
6603827,5,B00MWVRWYC,"This is a movie (short) meaning it is only 25 minutes long, not the normal 90 minute plus feature film, but what a fantastic story to help us remember what Christmas is about . . . I would highly recommend this movie for your family Christmas party or just to show to your kids to give them a reason to give thanks for what they have and remember the REAL REASON for the Christmas holiday.",1417392000,7,389,4.2

6603837,5,B00MWVRWYC,"Great family movie that focuses on the Savior and leaves you with good feelings. Perfect Sabbath day film for kids, and short length for those who don't have a long attention span. Darin Southam is wonderful at portraying Jesus.",1460592000,,228,4.871794871794871

6603848,5,B00MWVRWYC,"I don't know what it is about Christmas movies, but the ones that are heartwarming, pack a punch full of emotion, have a Christmas miracle, and help me remember what's really important are the best! This is a short one, about 25 minutes long, but it's got all of the elements of a truly great movie. Definitely check this one out to get into the true holiday spirit.",1450656000,,366,4.397058823529412

6603851,4,B00MWVRWYC,"This was a short (22 minutes) movie, but it was a nice one.  I'm guessing it's a Mormon film, since I got recommendations for a Mormon propaganda film after I ordered it, but the message was not about propaganda, just a Biblical themed one and my family enjoyed it.",1444348800,5,265,4.408163265306122

6603854,4,B00MWVRWYC,"A short film.  A story of simple faith, and the results of that faith.
The boy actor, Jacob Buster, played his role well.  In the story he is crippled, yet he looks after sheep to help his mother.
His father happens to be a boy shepherd at the birth of Jesus.  He wants to meet this Jesus, when Jesus comes to him.",1438992000,4,314,4.032258064516129

Writing, acting, story line were all very well done.  I know I cried but could not see the rest of the family as they were all in front of me.  All of the children were spellbound.",1514332800,,313,4.098360655737705

8675208,3,B00MWVRWYC,"This movie's plot is derived from the first televised opera, AMAHL AND THE NIGHT VISITORS, by Giancarlo Menotti.  The widowed mother, the crippled boy, the crutch and the innocence of a boy's faith are even more poignant in the opera.",1481241600,,234,4.85
