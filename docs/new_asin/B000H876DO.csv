8137538,5,B000H876DO,"What Penn Stater would not cry when they hear John Cappeletti's Heisman speech in 1973 when he dedicates his trophy to his sick brother Joey?  If his speech doesn't bring tears to your eyes, you need to have your head examined.

This is the true story of Joey Cappeletti, who loves sports and idolizes his big brother John.  However, he has leukemia.  John, a Penn State football player, aims to win something for Joey, hence the title.  In 1973, John leads Penn State to a perfect season, in which he wins college football's highest individual honor.  His inspiration is his little brother Joey.  Joey gets to mingle in the locker room with the players on football Saturdays, and even receives his own jersey as a birthday present from coach Joe Paterno.

Of course, I cried like a baby when I heard the Heisman speech.  But then, who doesn't?",1330387200,,844,4.648648648648648
8137539,1,B000H876DO,"I bought this video, and it was NOTHING like the description except the actual movie.  Very disgusted.  I thought I was buying a nice video with the origonal poster like the description.  Well, to my surprise, it was a burnt copy of the movie with some computer printed paper, and dvd paper cover.  I am not impressed or ammused.  I highly recommend blocking this seller from any buisness in the near future.  Congrats crook, You got me, JERK!",1268438400,2,443,4.615384615384615

I contacted the seller and asked for another dvd. I got another copy about 2 weeks later and again the dvd kept freezing. So, my son and I have not been able to watch the movie at all.
