7988869,4,B000093NPK,"I loved this show mainly because of the fun action. Its fun and nothing serious and good entertainment and if you are looking for something serious then this ain't for you.

Some of the fighting can be kinda fake cos of the strings here and there. A real pity that its been cancelled in during season 4",1106265600,,302,4.298245614035087
7988870,4,B000093NPK,"This is one show that I somehow miss on tv, but decided to pick up on a whim.  The production values seem quite high for this series; the cinamatographic scope rivals that of Buffy or Alias, and the action sequences are equally surprizing, even outdoing the work of Whedon (sorry, Joss!).

It is, however, in the storyline where Mutant X comes up short.  It lacks witty banter and plot points which could surprize instead are spelled out for the viewer.  My understanding is that this series has had trouble with Fox because of its similarities to the X-Men franchize (they're both even sponsored by Marvel!), so the set-up with Adam feels a little more forced than simply being born with a mutation.  The series, however, still deserves a look-see for the curious television fan who doesn't have the time to research syndicated listings.",1091491200,3,838,4.8321678321678325
7988871,5,B000093NPK,"I love this series, period! But what makes it unique from other shows is its change of personality from season to season without losing its greatness. Season One was mostly the team battling evil scientist Eckhart. The action scenes were Hong Kong style martial arts. They corrected that in Season Two by using their mutant powers instead of fists, which is why Sci-Fi/Fantasy fans watch these shows in the first place. And they branched out storywise by facing a variety of villains not linked to Eckhart. In Season Three, their scientist/leader Adam is gone and the group is on its own.
But back to this disk. As a huge Victoria Pratt fan, I had to have this one first because ""Fool For Love"" is on it. Pratt covers just about every aspect of acting in this episode. To boot, she and husband/director TJ Scott do a full length commentary, discussing not just memories of the show, but also technical stuff on how the show is made. For Pratt fans, this is a rare chance to hear her speak as herself. You won't be disappointed. You also get a better picture of why Scott is a good director. As in other work, here he chooses some unique camera angles that are effective, but not often used.
Another great thing about watching this DVD was the improvement in sound and picture quality. First, you get anamorphic wide screen which gives it a movie theater feel as well as greater fullness to the shot. Also, you hear sounds that you don't hear on TV, as well as better sound on what you did hear. It's like seeing it again for the first time.",1065744000,10,1540,4.503571428571429
