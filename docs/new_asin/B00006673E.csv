7962094,5,B00006673E,"I love this show. It's one of the few that I love that my husband likes also. My daughter is starting to watch it too.
This show is great in the fact the Yusuke doesn't always win, unlike some shows where you know the 'hero' will always win the fight no matter what. Yusuke actually gets his butt kicked multiple times, he's not some all-powerful fighter.

Love this anime!!!",1361923200,,375,4.434782608695652
7962095,5,B00006673E,"Yusuke Urameshi is a high school delinquent. He doesn't go to class, and he's always getting in fights. One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

Yusuke's 2nd case is to compete for the chance to become an apprentice to a famous psychic. The trouble is another demon is competing for the same honor. If it gains this power humanity could be in major trouble.

This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1440,4.2101449275362315
7962096,4,B00006673E,"It's a requirement of every action anime that the hero undergo some kind of training with an older and more powerful master of... whatever. That finally kicks in in the third volume of Yusuke Urameshi's journey, ""Yu Yu Hakusho - A New Apprentice"" -- lots of fighting, magical powers, and a surprising revelation about Yusuke's psychic classmate Kuwabara. Oh yeah, and a bad guy too.

Yusuke is sent to the mountain abode of the aged psychic Genkai, who is selecting her final apprentice ; he's secretly there to weed out the devious power-stealing demon Rando for Spirit World. As an odd twist, one of the countless applicants is also Kuwabara -- and the two boys quickly take the lead in the competition, whether it's bizarre video games or a deadly trek through Genkai's swamp.

When there are too many contestants left after the swamp, Genkai decides to winnow down the numbers with a one-on-one tournament -- and Yusuke quickly encounters a particularly nasty foe who can beat him senseless in the dark. And Kuwabara is set against an opponent that he doesn't seem able to beat, until he expectedly generates a special new weapon of his own.

Unfortunately, the tournament pits Yusuke against the deadly ninja bodyguard Kazemaru, whose shuriken are able to track their target. And Kuwabara is pitted against a deceptively childlike little man. Which one is Rando? Seriously, guess!

We've seen that Yusuke Urameshi can kick large quantities of butt and has the spirit gun, but now it's time for him to get a crusty old mentor and some formal training (in true action anime style). ""Yu Yu Hakusho - A New Apprentice"" seems to be gearing up for Yusuke to have all that, but first he has to figure out (with only his unused brains to guide him) who Rando is and somehow defeat him. God help the world.

Unsurprisingly there's a lot of fighting in these four episodes -- ki swords, psychic helmets and a few clever twists (such as Yusuke using his cigarette) -- and some rather fun competitions to see who is eligible. One fun scene involves a karaoke machine and the tone-deaf Kazemaru, as well as a punching machine and a rock-paper-scissors video game. And Yusuke spices things up during the swamp trip by going up against a ""lethal man-bat"" who talks like Gollum.

After some episodes devoted to Yusuke's work as a spirit detective, we do get to see a bit more of Kuwabara and Yusuke's antagonistic friendship -- they bicker, gripe (""Don't be an ignoramus, Urameshi!"") but they really do care about each other, as when Kuwabara is badly injured. And the big rough'n'tough guy also gets a new weapon of his own -- a spirit sword, a blade made out of his ki during one of the fights (""But how do I turn it off?"").

""Yu Yu Hakusho - A New Apprentice"" is a pretty solid introduction into this mini-arc, although it never gets around to FINISHING the storyline. So be sure to have the fourth volume on hand.",1242345600,,2906,4.686274509803922
7962097,5,B00006673E,"Yusuke competes to become, and keep a demon from becoming, the apprentice of the new character Genkai. He is not the only one we know competing though, Kuwabara is as well. It is one competition that keeps you on your toes, but provides plenty of laughs as well.",1052784000,,262,4.479166666666667
7962098,4,B00006673E,"I only gave it four stars so I could save 5 stars for the very best YYH videos, but this is still a great and essential part of the story. Vital character development develops here as the series prepares for all the adventures that lie ahead. Brutal ending, and one that makes you want to get the next video. Buy and enjoy!",1032393600,,323,4.225806451612903
7962099,5,B00006673E,"I am not going to talk about nothing and get annoying and sound obsessive in this review, I'm gonna get right down to the point. If you have seen te first 8 episodes than i suggest you read this otherwise don't and see those first 8 so what I am saying is not confusing you.
Episode 9: Yusuke had just finished his first case as spirit detective and of course he is in for another. Boton(Yusuke's assistant and Grim Reaper) tells Yusuke of Genkai(a very powerful psychic) who fears her death is near, is holding a series of tests with the winner being taught her powers.  It is thought that a demon, Rando, will enter the tournament in disguise. Rando is a very powerful demon who has taken the lives of 99 psychics for there techniques and if he inherets genkais powers he would be unstoppable. Yusuke shows up at Genkais where he finds Kuwabara. Kuwabara being Yusuke's Rival being there for a different reason then everyone one else there, decides he will pass the tests hopping he can beat Yusuke in the end.
Episode 10: The tests are over and now it  is down to 8 finalists including Yusuke and Kuwabara.  Genkai decides to have everyone left to fight in a tournament, but this won't be easy because they have to fight in the dark. Two fights are over and Kuwabara is next up. Things don't look good for Kuwabara. Just when Kuwabara is about to die something happens his energy forms into a solid object(a sword). The battle ends and Yusuke is up next. Things look even worse for Yusuke where he must fight the incredibly powerful Kibano. Can he come up on top or will he be defeated before he can get to Rando.
Episode 11: Yusuke continues his fight and finally ends it.  Now Genkai has brought the 4 Semifinalists outside to finish the tournament. Yusuke doesnt get a break and now must have another battle this time with Kazemaru. Kazumaru has many tricks up his sleave. Is Rando Kazemaru or could he be Shorin? Can Yusuke defeat the extremely powerful bodyguard.
Episode 12: Kuwabara's Semifinals match is next against Shorin. Shorin might look small and weak, but looks aren't everything. Shorin also is a powerful fighter, though just a child, with interesting techniques. Will Kuwabaras spirit sword be enough to defeat Shorin? Just an idea for you the last episode doesnt end the case so you might want to buy Volume 4.",1027123200,5,2332,4.585131894484412
