8248931,1,B00133GTIA,"I was sorely disappointed with this DVD. I give this product 1 star for the simple reason the title is misleading. There is no content on this DVD regarding general information about solo guitar composing and arranging. This DVD is more of a Master Class on six of Juber's songs. The six songs are ""PCH"", ""Liquid Amber"", ""Gardenia"", ""Mosaic"", ""Stolen Glances"", and ""Bullet Train Boogie"". On each song, Juber in great detail goes over the chords and chord components used through the songs. It is incredibly boring to watch and somewhat hard to follow. It is actually easier to absorb this information from the sheet music of these songs included on the disc as a PDF document. Juber does not elaborate much beyond information that is already on the sheet music. If you are looking to learn how to compose and arrange for solo guitar, this DVD product is not the place to start. I was hoping to learn about what the title described, but instead got a video of Juber playing his songs and telling us what chord he is using.",1388707200,4,1021,4.615384615384615
