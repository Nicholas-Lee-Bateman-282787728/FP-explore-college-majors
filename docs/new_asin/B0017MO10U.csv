3173711,5,B0017MO10U,Watched the movie. I enjoyed it very much. It's like the old time Stargate. Grandfather paradox and Goa'uld. I wished the movie was longer. I pre-ordered one for my collection.,1215388800,4,176,4.9
3173712,3,B0017MO10U,"They went back and killed your grandfather.
The Time-line changed and the Gould are back in force
taking over Earth.
This movie is answer to how do you get a new episode
when you have completely won.
It also brings back Richard Dean Anderson much like a Captain Kirk
guest shot for a future  Star Trek.
My beef is that there is plenty of good sci fi
to make movies of, why try to make Rocky XX out of
Star Gate SG1?",1215302400,5,415,4.060975609756097
3173713,5,B0017MO10U,"After 10 seasons stargate was still going strong.  The Arc of Truth which finnished up the Ori story line was just ok in my opinion but this one was amazing... The effects, story and acting was perfect.  It was exciting to see my favorite team back in action allong with Baal the last of the system lords.  If you ever liked the original feel to stargate you will love this.  I am amazed at how well they did and it even had Jack back too.  Two words... ""Buy This!""  Bluray is even better!  I only wish this came to theaters........",1215216000,14,532,4.26
3173714,4,B0017MO10U,"A real action-packed adventure. There's never a dull moment in Stargate Continuum. I'd love to give you more details but seeing how it hasn't been released yet, today is July 3rd, I don't want to spoil it for my fellow Stargate brothers and sisters.

This is definitely a must have for your collection. You won't be disappointed, at least not much. However, I didn't like how one character had to make a sacrifice in the end. Aside from that, I'm very happy with this movie.",1215043200,11,474,4.576470588235294

3173724,5,B0017MO10U,"For all of us Stargate fans of many years running, ""Continuum"" may well be our last viewing of the cast we have enjoyed for so long, at least all doing Stargate. Whereas ""Ark of Truth"" wrapped up the storyline unfinished when the series ended, ""Continuum"" gives us closure on the last System Lord on the loose ... the ever elusive Baal. Baal was a good choice to end Stargate stories with. Surprisingly charming and engaging despite his predilection for absolute evil, using him for this finale casts a fitting salute to the ongoing System Lord arc which had such sturdy legs in carrying the series year after year.

Here the SG-1 team returns to Earth on the heels of mysterious circumstances to find that Earth as they know it has changed in ways both subtle and dramatic. Although the people they should know, but don't, believe them, they are completely unwilling to take any action to set things ""right"" ... in fact quite the opposite. The most damaging change is the lack of a Stargate program, and when the System Lords show up to begin their bombardment of Earth, it becomes obvious to everyone that they should have paid more attention to the returning SG-1 members!

The blu-ray presentation is beautiful ... reference quality. Sound and effects are at the typical blu-ray level of magnificent. Obviously, I have not the slightest technical quibble with this presentation.

As the ""Star Trek: TNG"" finale reminded us, all good things must come to an end. If this is the last Stargate story we see from our beloved original cast, it was a satisfying and fitting curtain call.",1503360000,5,1584,4.773722627737226

3173734,3,B0017MO10U,"Not as good as I hoped. The film seamed slow paced and had, in my opinion, a very simple story line. I had hoped Richard Dean Anderson was a bigger part of the film. He was more of a side character. I had expected something extremely epic, but it felt more like an average season episode. It did finish the story line for Baal which was good to have finalized, since the last season didn't show what happened to the last of his clones.",1488931200,,435,4.190476190476191

3174052,2,B0017MO10U,"The original Stargate movie was amazing. Stargate Continuum feels like a longer television episode. I wanted to like it, and wasn't expecting much, but had to stop this thing in the first act. Only die hard fans could enjoy this tripe.",1403568000,,235,4.7560975609756095

3174056,3,B0017MO10U,"in my opinion. Maybe 3 1/2 stars. I felt Ark of Truth was a little anticlimactic at the end. Continuum is paced a little differently, but not dull.  Interesting to see Cam, Daniel, and Sam in street clothes again. Non stop action finale. I've seen it twice now and would probably watch it again if it came on.",1402876800,,309,4.327586206896552

I am a big fan of Stargate SG-1 and was saddened when it went off the air therefore when the movies came out I was happy.  This particular one is a nice continuation of the characters, but can be watched and followed even if you had never seen a Stargate SG-1 show before.",1400976000,,420,4.109756097560975

Of note, M. Shanks -- definitely deserves kudos.  Believable and, in my opinion, hit the mark on authenticity .  The others' acting seemed forced (Beau Bridges), while others seemed too comfortable (yes you, Richard Dean Anderson) in their role -- it made for an uneven overall perception of the movie's performance.  The story line was decent which kept me awake for the entire movie; I tend to drift during movies that follow the original.  But this one was ok.

3174106,2,B0017MO10U,I am a fan of all things Stargate. But this episode is a total bummer. We are supposed to believe that just a few cosmetic time changes - or is that cosmostic? - time changes warp and twist everyone's character from hero to zero. The warped characters of the other-dimensional Stargate regulars are all losers. Guess we better stick to our own dimension!,1394755200,,354,4.634920634920635

The Goa'uld were the ""best'' bad guys in the series and the big one (after Ra) was Ba'al, good way to end things with a major character brought back and plenty of plot twists & turns.

3174260,5,B0017MO10U,"It's mid-2012 and I've watched this film about 5-6 times by now.  As far as reviews go, I give Continuum 5-stars as a fine sci-fi B-movie with the understanding that B-movies should be judged within their own category.  Due to budget constraints, this work went direct to DVD and was never intended as a major theatrical release; many of those who wrote very negative reviews apparently did not understand this. True, there was no award-winning score, parts of the film seemed rushed, we couldn't spend enough time with our beloved characters and there were plot holes you could drive a truck through, but who cares? This is SG-1 on another mission to save the galaxy, there's no time for all that other stuff!

I thought Continuum was the perfect end to the franchise but had my fingers crossed when they rebooted the series with Stargate Universe, a show that went down in flames and deservedly so (though the final two episodes got it right, just too late). There comes a time when all good things must come to an end; for Stargate, it was with Continuum.

Side Note: It was nice that they gave Claudia Black a completely different character, a very juicy role as bad bad girl who ends up slicing her husband (a system lord no less) in half -- vertically -- from head to -- uh -- the family jewels. Now THAT's just plain mean!

I wish we had more entertainment of this caliber; you know, good guys vs. bad guys, good guys win.  I think that's why this show appealed to adults just as much as it did to the kids. These characters had principles, morals and stood up for the the things they believed to be right and true -- no moral ambiguity, no relativism, no philosophical navel-gazing. More importantly, they were family and some of us considered them a part of our family.

As he stood near the gate entrance ramp to give last-minute orders to SG-1 and see them off on yet another dangerous mission, General Hammond would always impart these final words as the team entered the gate:

3174264,2,B0017MO10U,"The original Stargate movie was pretty good, but I apparently missed at least one in between, because this one seemed to be assuming I knew things about the characters that I did not know.

3174271,5,B0017MO10U,"June 27, 2011

I have just completed my viewing of all ten Stargate SG-1 seasons and the two movies: Ark of Truth and Continuum. Regarding the seasons, I despised the episodes that were silly and comical. Fortunately there were only a few, and therefore they should not dissuade you from watching the other episodes. Certainly Stargate SG-1 is one of my favorite TV series. It's right up there with Star Trek NG, Star Trek Voyager, Star Trek Enterprise, 4400, Battlestar Galactica, and Smallville.

The two Stargate movies are also very good, with one important qualification. To get full appreciation of the movies, you should have familiarity with the series. I think the last three seasons--8, 9, and 10--should suffice, though of course all ten seasons would be best. Also, you should watch Stargate: The Ark of Truth after watching Season 10 and before watching Stargate: Continuum.

Another reviewer says that Stargate: Continuum feels a bit rushed. I agree, but I neither condemn the movie nor lower my rating of it for that reason. As happened in a number of the Stargate episodes, sometimes the viewer needs to fill in details. Sometimes you get only a few words explaining what happened. But if you are attentive, if you have familiarity with the Stargate universe, and if you have a decent science-fiction imagination, you should be all right.

Again, I think Stargate: Continuum was a very good movie. As I write, it stands as the conclusion of the Stargate SG-1 epic, and I am pleased with it.",1309132800,,1506,4.894117647058824
3174272,5,B0017MO10U,"Firstly, I am a STARGATE newbie so please bear with me. I bought SG:C beause I was in the mood for realisic sci-fi. In that regard, it does not dissapoint. What accucally caught my eye was the Browder/Black acting team. If Mr. Browder was Han Solo in FARSCAPE, then he is Indiana Jones in SG:C",1298419200,,293,4.345454545454546

This was basically a two part stargate episode with a  higher budget and it was one of the last things that Don Davis ever filmed before his death. He played General Hammond and many other characters during his career of course. (rip d.d.) Anyways this is in no way deserving of bad reviews IF you like stargate sg-1. It's a average tale for the team as they travel through time, personally I would have liked a nontime travel story for their final adventure. Sadly At this date I can't see them making another one. I wish they would though. The blu ray looks stunning and it's a even better deal on the two movie pack with 'the ark of truth' blu ray. I still have hopes for this series to be on blu ray but that's not happening at this time. However the excellent series ""space 1999' has made it to blu ray and that's a plus. ALthough it doesn't help us sg fans!  Anyways I enjoyed this movie but it's not the best story of this series by far. This one is for sg fans all the way and that's who should want this one the most.

The first half is lacking in action, and you don't see much of O'Neill in this one. He shows up in the first few minutes of the film and the last few, but that's it. And the story is lacking in structure. The second half of the movie wasn't that bad, but still not worth wasting your money on.

3174281,4,B0017MO10U,"STARGATE: ARK OF TRUTH more or less wrapped up the Ori portion of SG-1 and STARGATE: CONTINUUM does pretty much the same thing with the Gou'ald arc.  I think this is appropriate, given that the Gou'ald started off the movie that anticipated the series.  There aren't a lot of Gou'ald left at this point, only Ba'al. But at least they go out with a bang, with an innovative, fun, interesting story.  The first two post-SG-1 movies have not been masterpieces, but they have both been very good.  This is no mean feat.  If you contrast it with the various BABYLON 5 movies, the SG-1 movies have been far superior.  This despite the fact that BABYLON 5 was a far more impressive show.  The two SG-1 movies have been so successful that a third is now in the works.

Hopefully that movie will have more involvement with my favorite member of the SG-1 team, Claudia Black.  I'm not quite certain where her pregnancy fell in the filming schedule, whether she had it immediately before filming or if she had it afterwards, but it did mean that she was not fully available.  Her diminished role hurt the show some.  I always felt that SG-1 improved sharply as soon as she joined the series.  She brought both a sexiness and some humor that had been missing before she arrived.  Hopefully she will play a much more prominent role in this film.

The financial success of these two movies are great news for SF fans everywhere, even if they don't follow SG-1.  The DVD industry hasn't quite figured out what to do with direct-to-DVD.  There are a lot of niche markets that could support direct-to-DVD films.  The success of the SG-1 films might, for instance, mean that long hoped for sequel to SERENITY (though the ongoing success of various cast members -- Nathan Fillion, Summer Glau, Gina Torres, Adam Baldwin, and, most recently as main face of the alien invaders on V. [though she also had a prominent role on SG-1], Morena Baccarin].

They should at least do like Star Trek did, the movies yes, but also ""so far"" Season 1 of TOS and already planned to have the 2 other seasons come out in a couple of months... this gives hope to get all Star Trek in Blu-ray.

Unfortunately as some have already pointed out, it was a disappointment. Others have already touched on the mediocre story and predictable ""coincidences"". I haven't read through all of the reviews so maybe someone else has mentioned this problem. Basically, as of this review, the voices/sound of the actors on the dvd is horrible. It's as though they ran out of money so they couldn't afford to overdub the actors voices and simply went with the sound that was recorded in the scene no matter how bad it was, ie; reverb, echos, barely audible, etc. I gave it 3 stars just because I love Stargate and the actors, but it's sad to think they are ending these adventures with this substandard last entry.",1247184000,,823,4.7622377622377625

While the idea is very good, I'm sorry to say the movie was profoundly very tedious, not as exciting as I hoped. So if you want alternate universes please check Star Trek Deep Space Nine or the books in which the idea is used.

3174289,4,B0017MO10U,"The ending of the ""Stargate SG-1"" TV show left some threads dangling -- the last Goa'uld System Lord was still in hiding, and the Ori were still threatening the world.

Fortunately the Goa'uld plot threads are more or less tied up in ""Stargate: Continuum,"" the second of the two Stargate direct-to-DVD movies. This movie is a bit of a mind-bender (especially with all the time-skipping and temporal wrinkles) but it brings back all the favorite characters (and some dead ones) and finishes the story off in true Stargate style.

SG-1 and General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) are watching the execution and extraction of Ba'al... but unfortunately, it's not the real Ba'al. The real Ba'al has time-traveled and altered the timeline, causing Teal'c (Christopher Judge), Vala (Claudia Black) and the Tok'ra to vanish, and resulting in Jack's death.

Unfortunately, this alternate timeline becomes more perilous after a year -- Earth is being threatened by the supreme System Lord Ba'al, his queen Qetesh (in Vala's body) and his First Prime Teal'c. But when Qetesh and Ba'al clash over his past on Earth, the altered SG-1 must band together to find and destroy Ba'al's time machine, and somehow restore the timeline to what it once was. Or to something resembling it.

""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" and ""Stargate: Continuum"" are basically intended to wrap up loose ends, and as a standalone story ""Stargate Continuum"" is not quite as satisfying as the television show was. And frankly, ""Continuum"" may need multiple viewings to keep up with the time-bouncing plotline -- it scrambled my brain on the first time.

But as a finale, it serves the Goa'uld storyline well -- lots of action, space battles, ""snakeheads,"" and a way bigger budget that a TV episode would ever have allowed. And it has everything that you'd expect from ""Stargate SG-1"" -- icy strandings, some recurring characters (Apophis!), and alien nasties with overwhelming power. There's less of a moral dilemma here, but it's still pretty good.

It also has excellent scripting: plot threads drawn from the TV series, witty dialogue (""That is, after all, why we've come. Why we had to endure all of that singing. Get rid of the last bad guy and then there's cake""), and some nice quiet moments, such as Teal'c talking with Tomin about their bloodstained pasts. And they manage to throw some interesting twists at the audience, such as a shocking revelation about the Ori.

And seeing the actors as their SG-1 characters is like putting on a comfortable old shoe. Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks are suitably brilliant and courageous, and Ben Browder gets to shine as a strong, slightly quirky soldier. Meanwhile, both Christopher Judge and Claudia Black are impressive as their ""alternate timeline"" selves who are still part of the Goa'uld empire.

And of course, Richard Dean Anderson utterly steals the show whenever he appears (""Hey, have you ever tried to find a bathroom in a pyramid?"") and this is the last appearance of Don S. Davis as General Hammond. Rest in peace.

It's a little sad to see the main storylines of the Stargate universe end, but ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" and ""Stargate: Continuum"" are well worth seeing. Nice finales.",1242259200,6,3216,4.996261682242991

Jack is back and gets `into it' with Baal.
We finally wrap the 10 year storyline of the System Lords.
General Hammond returns, but sadly in his final role.

Baal changes time to a degree where the Stargate program never got started, the Gate is lost and this opens the door to the Goauld invasion.  Our heroes, with the earlier timeline in their memories (somehow??) fail to convince their counterparts in this timeline until it's practically too late.  Can Tealc be counted on?

Edge of your seat suspense - great Air Force jet shots.  This story would almost be a regular episode but the production values are superior to what I've seen on SciFi Channel.

Great special effects, space battles and a somewhat twisty time-travel storyline brings the gang together for one final leap in the Stargate universe.

I really hope they bring back more movies.  I hear there's a new spinoff which is written by the same guys who wrote Stargate SG-1.  Can't wait.

The Layman's Guide to Time Travel segment was rather enjoyable as an actual Astrophysicist describes some of the fundamental concepts behind time travel and the use of Einstein-Rosen bridges (aka wormholes). The Grandfather paradox also played a short role in the film, but many questions were still left unanswered although the viewer can assume the path of events (namely Mitchell's return to 1939 and how the other Mitchell figures out the events at the end of the movie). It was an excellent Stargate movie but the overall feel still seemed like a long series finale rather than a motion picture caliber film. I suppose it is necessary to keep the budget down and I would still recommend SG-1 fans watch Continuum because it wraps up everything quite nicely and a LOT of the old characters make a reappearance.",1229126400,2,1001,4.964285714285714

3174317,1,B0017MO10U,"And a slap in the face to the fans of this lame show!
I have watched every episode of this series at least once; some twice or even three times, if they are exceptional!
But what I cannot stand is being taken for a chump!
I am not going to go into a detailed review of these two ""Straight to DVD movies"".  There are more than enough posts to cover the bogus, rehashed plot elements.
I am briefly going to cover one important fact.  The Stargate & Company franchise's attitude to their viewers: ""To hades with you, give us your money chimp!""
This is the formula that is truly in place for the continuation of Stargate & Company!
They were supposed to release these movies on DVD and then air them on SciFi.  Greed entered the picture; and now it's like waiting on some lost Orson Welles masterpiece to finally be aired on telelvision.  Well, this is not masterpiece--though I wish it were lost.
To think of all the time spent by so many viewers of the show, and then these schmucks do not end the series; they just want to force everyone to buy a DVD that ends the series; but wait, it doesn't end it so you have to buy ""Continuum"" to have an ending.  But they are already trying to assemble the original cast for a third ending?  How many endings to we have to have?  As many as shall make them so comfortable they can buy their own Stargate! :(
And if you doubt my assessment, then you need only know that Stargate Atlantis is ending after only five seasons.  They are going to film a movie continuing their battle with the Wraith (the Goua'uld with bad, blue skin problems); this we are told shall air on Scifi, then go to DVD.  And if this promise is kept?  What about after?  I bet no more Scifi first airings.  Oh no: straight to DVD, and we may never see Atlantis movies on Scifi again.  Not that that wouldn't be a tragedy.  But the idea I am to shut up and buy a DVD to find out the ending of a show takes you and me for utter imbeciles.
In short: they can take the whole franchise, along with the con, and shove it up their ""stargate hole""!
And a third series is in the making: ""Stargate Universe"" or something like that.  It shall air on Scifi.  If it's successful, welcome to Ori-hell.  It's end without ending; and shall go to ""DVD movie of the week status!""  Just like these.
Idiotic.
We should all ""dial-out""; and leave Stargate as a very bad memory.  Sort of like roasted Prior, without the parsely!  Stick a fork in ""it"", and this franchise!  It is done . . .

Where was the originality, the interaction, the character development?  This movie could have rocked the house instead I went and made dinner.  Returning to realize I didn't need to rewind.

Production values are excellent.  Scenes hinted at in previous episodes regarding a massive invasion of earth by space are finally seen, and they do an excellent job of portraying earth under attack by space.

Virtually every old enemy re-surfaces in the movie due to the altered timeline story, and it is refreshing to see the familiar 'baddie' characters reprising these roles, even if only briefly.

You'll appreciate this movie the most if you see it after watching the main stargate series, obviously.  But the pacing, the interesting story, great special effects, and the excellent performance by Cliff Simon as Baal really make this a wonderful science fiction production in general.

It's also worth a pause when Daniel Jackson looks at the back cover of a book he published in the alternative timeline.

It would have been great if they threw in an appearance of the Russian commander that were in earlier StarGate episodes. Also, I wish Jack had a little more animosity towards Ball - after all, he did torture him more than any human ever (previous episodes). And in fact, after the torture episode is when Jack became more sarcastic. The writers probably did not even realize the timing of this slight character change. Jack is, through his sarcasm, still no doubt hiding the psycological pain of the torture Ball inflicted on him.

I was a huge Farscape fan (have all of their DVDs), so when we went to Stargate SG1 to Stargate SG1.3 I accepted the ""Bump"" and was sorry to see it wind down.
My only problem with both the regular and Blu-Ray DVDs was that Amazon gave me tracking numbers for both products, (which were pre-ordered), and the Postman had nothing to deliver for a month or so-both were in transit. I hope this means that MGM made a tidy profit and more will follow.

I think with ""Continuum"" they tried a little too hard to do something different. The idea was interesting, but the old time travel thing used so often in sci-fi was a little too stale here. Plus it seems to have detracted from what makes the show work: the characters. While some characters stayed themselves, others changed and were marginalized (Vala and Teal'c for example). Obviously when a series and contracts end it's hard to get all the actors back for a new project at the same time, but I think they could have kept the ""team"" dynamic that made Stargate work.

The movie has a very good story line and plenty of action.  It is not ""dumbed down"".  By that, I mean it leaves some things up to your imagination and thought process.  The flashbacks in time are kept to a minimum.  The special effects are great without being outrageous as in some movies.

The movie does have a bit more foul language than the rest of the Stargate episodes. Then again, it is kept to a minimum and used only in times of great distress.  It is still suitable for children, though.

I would like to have seen more of Apophis and the rest of the bad guys.  An appearance by Bra'tac as an advisor to Teal'c would have been nice.

At any rate, I think every person that is a true fan of Stargate will enjoy this movie.",1221782400,,862,4.291925465838509

Second: What happened with Richard D. Anderson, Brigadier General, USAF? He was advertised to play a larger role in this movie not a small teaser appearance. It felt like he didn't want to be there. Many feel that his wise cracks and ""poke fun at the man"" attitude portrayed by his character made the show. I am not knocking Gen. Anderson; he is one of the best actors of the 20th / 21st century. But if he is going to play O'Neill please do it full force or don't tease the fans.
Third: I thoroughly enjoyed the movie but the magic was subdued. This would have made a great TV Special Event to be released on DVD after it aired. Billing this as a ""Major Motion Picture Event"" is misleading. The ""lost in time"" and ""alternate time line"" has been done to death. With the entire universe just one Stargate step away why rehash an old story line. This was a missed opportunity to WOW the fans and pick up more followers.

We turned out the lights and watched it on my 55"" flat screen like we were at the movies. It has all the big picture feel to it, so one wonders why it didn't go to theatres? The fan base is huge and I would have paid for it.

Anyhow, it starts off well, moves into the plot line and just kind of loses its interest. we are supposed to believe that three SG 1 characters just give up and go along with the powers that be. totally unbelievable. then they need them and call them back...lame.

The witty return of Richard Dean Anderson as General Jack O'Neill will be enough to get the stalwart fans in a frenzy. But this story is much more than just a patch to ease the SG-1 fanatic's withdrawals since the series end. We are revisited by the die-hard Gua'ould system lord Ba'al, who is facing execution. But a crafty story woven through the fabric of time throws the entire existence of the SGC and the stargate program out of whack. All of the key players from the series run make their cameos, including an appearance by the late Don S. Davis as General Hammond (God rest his soul). This is a small screen spectacle that could have easily blazed across the silver screen. And the rumors are already circulating as of early September 2008 that pleasing DVD sales have spurred a third SG-1 adventure...with a rumored script already in the works.

I usually have found spin offs lacking from original releases but I just fell in love with this series and how the charactors all interact and bring out the best in each others charactors. I found Stargate Continuum to possess a fantastic storyline that keeps you captivated through out the movie. My only critical point is that the ending kind of comes up abrupt, kind of ""huh"" its over. I still loved this and will add it to my Stargate collection. A word of caution to potential buyers - there are bad imitations from market place sellers so beware. Amazon.com took great care of me as I was one who got taken from a low price and recieved a bootleg copy with sub titles you can not turn off.

It doesn't fill in any gaps or danglers left from the series as did the DVD-only release for ""The Ark of Truth."" The quality and story is top-notch as always although it's more of a small-screen episode. The extra features certainly make it worth watching (Amanda Tapping and submarines... by way of e.g.), if not purchasing for a home library.

The biggest thing about SG-1 is that it was such a compelling episodic piece that TV without it is bland... just as when the Star Trek serials were killed off by the bean counters, or BSG by it's regenerators... at least there's ""Stargate Atlantis"" for now... and the hopefully continuing DVD-only pieces like ""The Ark of Truth"" and ""Continuum.""

3174383,4,B0017MO10U,"This is the second movie after the conclusion of SG-1. It is a little more like a movie (rather than a long episode) because they are not finishing a story arc from the series.  Admitedly, they're still dealing with pre-established characters and situations.

It starts off with the team (and Jack O'Neill--hooray!) going to watch Baal, the last of the system lords, being forcibly removed from his host.  Baal tells the team that he is actually the last clone of Baal and that the real Baal has something special planned now that the final cloned symbiote is about to die.  Now the team, used to this sort of nonsense from Baal, don't believe him (I wouldn't either).  But then Teal'c disappears into thin air (casting darker doubts upon Vala's sudden absence from moments before).

Now, I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so I'm just going to tell you what you ought to know from the cover anyway.  It involves time travel and an alternate timeline. We see many familiar faces too, including some of the other system lords and Hammond. And, as always, there is lots of typical stargate comedy.

Having said this much, I assume that those who have seen the series (seasons one through ten) will be able to imagine what sorts of events go on (even if the particulars aren't all laid out for them).  Those who have not will be surprised (if perhaps a little confused).  As always, it helps in the watching of this film if you have a solid background with the characters and the events of the TV series.

I hope they will continue to make movies for the fans to see and hopefully will continue to incorporate both characters into the story line.

Made only for DVD and relying on special effects did not result in a good movie...
The Stargate Continuum movie we ordered from Amazon dot com still has to arrive at our house in Bandung Java. We watched it on BluRay hired from a local video DVD shop......and it is hoped this is pure co-incidence. Amazon US's customer care center tells us that both the Stargate Continuum order and another for 3 standard DVD's were shipped via DPGM (most likely Deutsche Post) and that the problem might be with the Indonesian Postal service. Considering we've never had a problem with the local labour intensive Indonesian postal people, I'd be of the opinion that there has been a gltich somewhere else. DVD's ordered via Amazon.co.uk arrive at our place within days from the United Kingdom. We've given it another try for some more blu-rays....fingers crossed I hope these will get here without ""going missing"".
Amazon in the US and UK have great web-sites and good service...let's hope those who are entrusted with  delivieries will keep their act ""clean""!

The title there is a joke since this is the third movies in the series, along with The original feature that spawned the series, and the ""Ark of Truth.""  I enjoyed the movie, but not as much as I expected. The twists in the end caught me off guard, because you won't expect what eventually happens to resolve the storyline. It felt a little bit cheap, like a 2 part TV episode more than a epic movie finale. On the other hand if, it didn't end the way it does, then it would have felt like a rehash of a previous episode. You'll know what I'm talking about if you see it.

One who has watched it ever since I got hooked on the show in the beginning as well as the Stargate movie way back in the day so when I say this movie was awesome, that means a lot. Time travel movies are always eeh at points because let's face it we have no idea how real or fake some situations might be. However this alternate time plot really gives this movie a great deep story and with the main bad guy being Bal, it's an instant classic. Definitely better than the first SG-1 DVD, The Ark of Truth, although completely different story but I have to say I like them both for what they are as well.

The movie was completely lacking in emotional exploration of the characters.  Delving into the character impact of separation and isolation in an alternate reality, and in the case of Daniel, the loss of a limb, might have added 10 minutes of time, but it would have significantly improved the movie.  I'm tired of lazy, sloppy writing.  Stargate is a great show for its themes and characters (and actors, all of them) but it has been poorly treated by its writers.

Continuum was just plain fun. Which is what I loved about SG-1. The reason I gave it four instead of 5 stars is because the whole going back and changing the time line thing's been done almost to death.

3174458,5,B0017MO10U,"Back To The Old Orifice Again

Rick Anderson, aka MacGyver, playing his alter ego, Jack O'Neill, in his breakout Sci-Fi show ""Stargate, SG1"" has previously referred to the Stargate as the ""Old Orifice"" with great nostalgia.
Even though the ""gate"" never attained the same reverence as the ""U.S.S. Enterprise"" did in the original Star Trek Sci-Fi show, it is without a doubt the single most important artifact of the popular show.
In the ""Stargate"" world, the limits of the gate led to more conventional forms of transportation during story development. The SG1 teams were later able to choose to travel via spaceships or even be scrambled and beamed ala Star Trek. However, it is ""the old orifice"" that takes center stage in this romp back through time.

Many of the unique features of the gate are presented which lead to problems that even the Ancient builders never seemed to bother fixing. For instance, why is every gate traveller subjected to being dumped on the other side of the wormhole without so much as a cheap shield that would protected them from a hostile greeting party?
As this scenario plays out, we discover that getting there really is the only fun part. Stargate's slickest bad guy, Bal'l, is back in form as the universe's biggest pain in the gate. While the entire team doesn't operate together in the beginning of the story every one is brought together near the end...for the ""do over"" of a lifetime.
 This is the best ""after series"" movie to date and captures the spirit of the early ""gate"" adventures.
If only B'all had brought along a personal shield the entire world would have turned out...well, you buy the movie and find out for yourself.",1219708800,,1669,4.788194444444445

3174476,4,B0017MO10U,"It's amazing what can end up coming from a simple movie. Back in 1994 a science fiction epic called Stargate hit the big screen. Written by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, and directed by Roland Emmerich, this movie ended up becoming a huge franchise.

Novels based on the original movie, Stargate SG1, Stargate Atlantis, an animated series called Stargate Infinity, books based on both television series, a D20 modern Role Playing Game, an impending Massive Multiplayer online game, comics, a rumoured third TV series and of course two direct to DVD movies.

This review is about the second direct to DVD movie, called Continuum.

As per usual, this review contains no spoilers other than what you might have seen in trailers or what you gleaned from the back cover. I don't like spoiling things for people.

The movie takes places shortly after the end of the series, and deals with the capture and the end of the last System Lord.

What appears to be a simple ceremony, one that would end with the extraction of the Symbiote, ends with what appears to be the re-writing of history.

Yes, it's a time travel movie, and it has all the elements any fan of science fiction would expect. Once again, I will not give away any spoilers about these elements or the rest of the plot itself.

Anyhow, in a way, the movie was a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting something a little more - well, epic in scale.

Hey, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, and even though I prefer Stargate Atlantis, it was good seeing the return of Richard Dean Anderson and all the rest of the regular cast.

Even Teal'c's former master.

Sorry, I digress.

Anyhow, the point of the matter is that this movie seemed to be nothing more than a two part episode that had been left over from the series... a two part episode that they had wanted to film, but for some reason it got pushed to the back burner and was never included in one of the last seasons.

Still, it had a good budget that allowed for the return of all your favourite characters (see above), and excellent special effects.

The funny thing is, even though it was direct to video, and had probably a slightly larger budget than normal for an episode, this movie was leaps and bounds better than a lot of direct to DVD movies that have come out in the recent past, ones that had budgets that probably far surpassed that of the one for this movie.

And Continuum was better, worth far more of your hard earned dollars than these others that I have hinted at, but will not name at this time.

This simple fact boggles my mind.

For those of you who happen to miss SG1, it's a nice visit from characters you've grown to love over the years and have missed since the end of the final season. It's almost a homecoming if you will for fans of the original series.

Frankly put though, The Ark of Truth was a better movie, but then again, it was produced to wrap up several story arcs.

This was more of a stand alone, almost a `thank you, here's one more adventure through the gate for all the loyal and loving fans'.

Personally, I really hope that we'll see more Stargate movies in the future. It'll be wonderful to see `old friends' once again.

Now, as to the bonus features included on the DVD - you have the ever present commentary with Brad Wright and Martin Wood, as well as three featurettes. The first is the Layman's Guide to Time Travel; the second Stargate goes to the Arctic and finally the Making of Stargate Continuum.

For rapid and casual fans alike.

If this were the only stargate show, I would not have any desire to watch another.

My wife and I had settled down to watch good entertainment and I really was not at all happy with what I saw.  It seemed confusing to me how they were pulling elements from different times and trying to put them under a single time.

3174481,5,B0017MO10U,"For fans of the first eight seasons of SG-1, this is a must-have. Not only is the filming far beyond what I'd expect to see on TV, the acting (especially by Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black) is outstanding. For those who like action, the CGI was good (though thankfully limited) and it's really hard to beat the big shots provided by the Arctic and all that military hardware! It was also very nice to see bit parts played by real armed forces personnel, just as in the past. Being a fan of time travel and alternate universe themes myself, the plot was well-done and was quite a bit different than what they've done in the past. The only complaint I might have would be that there was no forward movement in the development of the main characters, something to be expected in AT/AU stories.

However, I did come away with a much better appreciation for Cam Mitchell, which is a big deal for me.  I also never cared for Vala up until now- but Vala/Qe'tesh was superb in this movie, thanks to Claudia Black. Though his part wasn't big, it was great seeing O'Neill again, especially Colonel O'Neill, and it looks like there's still something up with the General and Carter. In general, though, this is an action film and all of the  character interactions are necessarily brief. Another ten minutes of run time could have given us that great team banter back again, and there were flashes of that, but they were limited by (I presume) aiming for a two-hour TV time slot.

All in all, I'd say the movie was technically very nice, exciting to watch, had a few nice character moments, and carries the story arcs developed in SG-1 very well. Since Ark of Truth and Continuum were great caps to two of the main story arcs, I'm looking forward to new adventures in future movies and maybe find out what the heck O'Neill has been up to the last few years, because certainly it seems that the SG-1 saga is far from over.",1218931200,,1910,4.495677233429395

Although Stargate:Continuum was another take on someone messing with the timeline,(see the Stargate episode 'Moebius') this movie is fun to watch.  It was too short for my taste so I'm hoping there's another movie planned in the future.  We learn some background history about the Stargate when Baal goes back in time to alter the timeline so he can defeat the other Goa'uld system lords and later conquer Earth.  The movie does a nice job working in (although briefly) many of the characters from over the years.  O'Neill makes a brief appearance (yay) and Mitchell gets to be a hero.

I was looking soooo forward to this movie and was disapointed. I own the entire series as well as there Sister series ""Atlantis"" and this will be the first part of it that I just won't buy.

ONE reviewer here said that he did not understand how Daniel got his leg back.  Uhhh ... DUH!!  OBVIOUSLY he got himself a PROSTHETIC leg.

The reason I only gave this movie 4 stars was because in other reviews on other sites, it was said that there were going to be hints about a NEW PROPOSED SG series called STARGATE: UNIVERSE.

I saw NO such hints.  BUT, I suppose that it could be because, last I read, SG: UNIVERSE is still up in the air as to whether it will be produced or not.  I really hope it IS produced, it sounds like a very unique concept in the SG franchise.",1218672000,,660,4.224

There was no comparison in watching the Arctic scenes (so-so) vs Planet Earth Blu-Ray (great).  Not sure why they'd even release this as blu-ray unless they're pulling a fast one.

The story had holes in it bigger than the gate itself.  When time changed, people were disappearing like Back to the Future style. poof?  The paradoxes are ridiculous..  like why is Baal able to travel back and stop the stargate from arriving in the US.  if he did that, he wouldn't know about Earth in the first place.  where did Baal get Anubis's ship?  how did Daniel's leg reappear?  why make mitchell the hero?  you'd think for a $7mil budget, they'd pull a better script together.

If ""Continuum"" is the new standard of what we (the fans) can expect to see in the future from this franchise, then they should just stop making these films now.  The plot to ""Continuum"" is silly, the narrative (the story and how it is told) is completely bland and devoid of life.

Okay, I'll confess that I bought Continuum because I needed a Stargate SG-1 fix. Since my beloved series traveled through that final wormhole after 10 fantastic years, I miss them. I'd have bought this movie regardless of what reviews might have said because I wanted to hang with the team again. Therefore, I was thrilled when the movie wasn't just watchable but was a well-plotted story filled with great characters who make you believe they really are a go-to team capable of saving the earth from destruction.

Full of twists and turns, the production values of Continuum make you feel as if you're watching a big-screen theatrical release rather than a made for video spinoff of a television series.

I won't spoil the surprises, but they are many and they're well-thought out and make you easily suspend disbelief. Get it and prepare for a thrill ride that doesn't depend on your being a former fan.

It's very well done, and it made me laugh and get a tear in my eye and also suprised me in places. Having lived in the COLD(Nome, not WAY THE HELL UP THERE), it was enjoyable to see the ""Making of"" featurettes, and I have to say it was as enjoyable as the movie. Being a Ben Browder fan, I loved the hair this time, Is it different?... or is it just me?  I had a hard time accepting him even with my LOVE of him after I watched the episodes to familiarize myself with the show when he came on because I fell in love with the O'Neil character.  In this movie and when I watch season 9-10 now, I'm HEARING his character and laughing because the writers gave him some funny ____to say, but I couldn't hear him for the comparisons I was making.  My Bad! What an impossible job to come in a replace the lead!  I especially loved seeing the characters settle into their new lives. Daniel Jackson calling himself was a touching scene. It was refreshing since it isn't always possible to 'relax' with a series time-frame. This might be a more feminine point of view...since some other reviewers might have enjoyed more action. I love action too, but often miss more 'personal' moments. I hope the fact that I had to got to 3 stores to find it(because they were sold out) is a huge incentive to make more Stargate movies.

There are twists and turns and surprises around every corner. One interesting note; the Arctic scenes are actually filmed in the Arctic and the submarine is the USS Alexandria, a nuclear sub with her crew.

Davis, and a great story.

I really liked how they played out the ""no Stargate program"" storyline.  If this was the last SG-1 movie (hopefully not), they definitely went out the right way.  I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie.",1218499200,,632,4.770642201834862

However, considering that it is the second Stargate 'feature film' this year, maybe I expected too much.  After all, the writers are pitching a fit about having to come up with 20 episodes a year for TV series these days.  The first few seasons of SG-1 contained at least 22 episodes each; and DS9 seasons typically contained 24 episodes or more!  It's a tough life writing Sci-Fi I guess.

I also agree that Continuum is certainly a better movie than The Ark of Truth.  Based upon both of these flicks, it looks like we're being treated to Stargate SG-1 Season 11 in roughly 1 1/2 hour episodes about every four months.

The next movie should include deleted scenes and bloopers in the special features?And since the movie is only available on dvd why not make it longer giving each character more play?I have seen most of the original series but plan on buying the box set next so I can see them all again.

It was also great to see Richard Dean Anderson and hear the quirky ""O'Neill"" humor again, I have missed it.

The movie has some outstanding scenes in the Arctic not the least of which is a sub coming up through the ice. The ""grandfather paradox"" raises some questions that has led to spirited discussion at Gateworld and other other places. Excellent commentary and extras.

When Baal travels back to Earth's past, he ensures that the Stargate program doesn't happen. Samantha Carter, Daniel Jackson, and Cameron Mitchell arrive back on Earth in a different reality and must figure out how to correct the timeline before the Goa'uld invade Earth and destroy all hope.

Fans of the record-breaking Stargate SG-1 series are in for a treat. Many characters from the show's past make brief appearances, as well as the late (and sorely missed) Don Davis. But the highlight for me was the featuring of my favorite Stargate bad guy: Baal, played by Cliff Simon. Baal's character has a wonderful blend of sarcasm and condescension, which has led to some wonderful scenes with the SG-1 team. And of course, all of SG-1 is back, including Richard Dean Anderson as Jack O'Neill.

Unlike the previous movie, The Ark of Truth, this movie is a stand-alone. And with the incredible special effects, this would have been great to watch on the big screen. From filming in the below-freezing temperatures of the Arctic to back in Vancouver, the scenery and backdrops are exceptional. I also had high expectations regarding the storyline, since it included time travel, one of my favorite subgenres of science fiction. I wasn't disappointed.  Though there were some convenient loopholes, the plot was fun and exciting.

All the regulars are back and we couldn't have been happier.  It was a lot of fun (something you don't see too much of on TV anymore).
I won't give any spoilers (where would the fun in that be???), but we do get to see some old bad guys and even Vala as K'tesh(!).  This is a movie for fans of the series.
My family and I really enjoyed it and hope that many more will too.  As mentioned in a different review, this was Don S. Davis' last appearance as Hammond as Mr. Davis died of a heart attack in June.  Condolences to his family aside, this is a blow to the SG-1 family as well.  He was there in the beginning and lent a touch of realism to the series and the movie.  He will truly be missed.  I hope in the next movie, he will be honored in some way by the cast and writers.

This story brings back the Goa'uld in a big way, right when you think they're going to be forever eliminated as a threat to Earth.  Tons and tons of actors from SG-1's 10 seasons are enlisted, and the storyline is awesome.  Too many times, TV shows that make a movie spend too much time giving the production a ""movie"" feel.  Continuum feels like a lost episode of SG-1 - time travel conundrums, what-ifs, and plenty of action kept me on my toes from start to finish.

Another plus, my girlfriend, who has only ever seen the original movie (Stargate) and Ark of Truth, really truly enjoyed Continuum and wants to watch the series.

I watched anyway not expecting much and gladly I was not disappointed.

The movie was rushed and it was flat, it felt like they wanted to make a movie but had no idea what to do. my Wife who has been watching the series since the very fist episode, walked out 20 minutes before the ending, when I asked if she wanted to see the end she asked ""would it make a difference?"" and I have to agree with her.

besides the story being unremarkable and tired there are the usual array of nits. I won't get into all of them because I don't have enough minutes in my life to recount them all but the crux of it for me is: Bal changes time and SOMEHOW our heroes are unaffected so they go about trying to fix things. when I read that originally I figured it would be explained in the film, nope no such luck. apparently the writers decided that SG1 was unaffected and that was that, no explanation as to why the entire universe changes and only our heroes are spared. the movie just goes downhill from there.

I don't know why they bothered to make this film, it is obvious that they really didn't have an idea of what to do so they just ran film and ran with it.",1217980800,10,1404,4.113138686131387

The movie itself is a good rompin' episode of the sci fi classic. But save your money and get the DVD.

3174514,5,B0017MO10U,"Yeah, I am a huge Stargate fan.  The franchise created by Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright is the longest running sci-fi series in the US.  While longevity might not always indicate quality, Stargate lived 10 seasons on network TV because it presented long story arcs along with interesting characters and situations that you wanted to watch week after week.

So, with that, this second movie produced after SG-1 was not renewed as a series on the Sci-Fi channel-- ""Continuum"" was definitely a treat. While the prior movie tied up lots of loose ends, Continuum is really a continuation of the franchise.  The use of an alternate time line provided an opportunity to give familiar characters different roles than they have played in the past.

The story, without revealing any details is ""simple"".  Ba'al as a continuing bad guy has a fail safe to prevent his (un)predictable demise.  The Stargate time line is changed and the Stargate program is not developed as it had been on Earth.  It is up to SG-1 to set things right, stop the destruction of Earth and the Gou'ld take down of the galaxy.  For such a familiar story line you would think it would be getting OLD.  Guess not!

Highlights?  Jack O'Neill makes an appearance.  Vala is wonderfully different in character, as is Teal'c -- both characters revealing a potential past.  The concept of time travel --especially getting to see how it is accomplished-- is always fun, along with the paradoxes time travel always seems to present. Oh, and as one of my friends always used to say to spoil things I had not seen yet.... ""everyone dies"".

If you are a fan, Buy this movie.  You will enjoy it.  If you are not a fan, start with season 1 and work your way forward!  You only have 10 seasons of spectacular sci-fi to get through.

I just hope that this is not the last thing we will be seeing of Stargate SG-1.  A tear forms in my eye thinking that might be the case....",1217721600,,1924,4.602941176470588

Now, all of us fans know this story is derivative of MANY previous Stargate episodes involving Time Travel, however, it's the execution that makes it stand out.  Ark of Truth was a good conclusion to the TV storyline, but this actually FEELS like a movie.

3174519,5,B0017MO10U,"This movie was SO enjoyable!!! If you were a Stargate SG-1 fan, you will have a very good time with this movie - and it WILL be over WAY too soon.  The writing for the ""Continuum"" script was EXCELLENT - action-packed and an interesting, clever story line. I liked the bigger budget effects - direction and production were a notch above what TV has time/money to do (and, by the way, the ""Stargate SG1"" TV series is WORTH BUYING - really wondered what SciFi was thinking when they cancelled it). I wanted even more cast time in the ""Continuum"" storyline (there were places which could have used it, but the budget didn't permit, I've read).  I LOVED having snippets of all the characters old/new (so good together) - especially having ""Jack"" back. It would have been great to have Jack in much more of the movie. I always get laughs from the writing for Jack's witty sarcasm. I realized with great nostalgia, how much I MISSED the SG1 TV show (with these characters - so great to have them all together in ""Continuum"" - the regulars Samantha, Jackson, Teal'c, Vala - Jack's return, Landry, Hammond, Hays, etc.). I think Ba'al is a wonderful bad guy. I wish the $ people (MGM, I've read) would decide to do more SG1 movies this well done or even better with a bigger budget (maybe do 2 films at one time) - if they can fund scripts this clever and well-written AND with the full cast which includes Richard Dean Anderson.  Even though they'd have to film around everyone's schedules - leave no wo/man behind!  All characters are needed (we've grown to love them altogether) - to be REALLY GOOD - as this movie is - would make me want to spend my money to buy it - as this movie did.",1217635200,7,1680,4.444805194805195

I didn't like how the government split them up and I wondered how they got each other's cell phone numbers when they were not to communicate, but that's life.

I just didn't believe the government would let them live on their own or utilize their knowledge until after Baal appeared.  Granted, I believed the part of the government setting on their butts, but with all of Carter's knowledge they would not have let her go off and live a solidary life.

I caught the twist in the beginning - that part was good and you saw the foreshadowing, and it made for a full circle of where Stargate began, but it wasn't enough to make this a ""Wow"".

This is classic SG-1, impossible odds, the team working together, and a satisfying conclusion.  This is a balanced story between the characters (although Vala gets short-changed again), and not the Cameron Mitchell love-fest AOT was.  The special effects were stellar, the score is phenomenal, although at times too loud to hear the characters lines.  If this is what future Stargate movies will be like, sign me up to pre-order right now.

Taking story elements and themes from pretty much every season of the show, Continuum chronicles the final chapter of the Goa'uld System Lords.

Sweeping, breath-taking cinematics shot on site in the Artic and compelling storyline aside, one thing that I was very pleased to see was the continued humanization of Claudia Blacks' character, Valla, as evident in one of the closing scenes of the film - hinting at the growth hinted at in the character during the Ark of Truth film.

It plays like the shows I came to love and look forward to while the series was on the air and it has the added bonus of a larger budget which shows in the special effects and in the sets.

3174530,1,B0017MO10U,"I was let down by this movie, I've read the other reviews and I can understand how people are excited by seeing their favorite characters back again, but personally I think they are over-rating this film and not being critical enough.  Don't get me wrong, its ok but that's about it, it would have made a good two part episode but not a great movie.  The problem here is they are adding a little extra for effects or going on location and just selling episodes as movies at $16 to $20.  So what were my problems:

Length - this was too short for what they wanted to accomplish.  They could have added an hour to this and really added to the plot.  If I'm going to buy episodes of Stargate, I at least want to feel like I'm getting enough for my dollar.

Subplot - The subplots were stupid, Mitchell's grandfather just so happens to be the captain of the ship carrying the stargate in 1939.  Yeah that's believable, your audience isn't stupid and that subplot added nothing to the overall film, it was a complete distraction.  Oh, and of the entire Armed Forces to just happen to be at the North Pole training - It's Jack O'Neill, yeah ok again your audience is stupid and you're the smartest script writers in the world.  Give me a break.

From TV to Movie -  I sense a lot of the problems with this film, and potentially future films is going to be coming from an overly excited crew that are getting to do more making a movie than they did making a TV episode.  They seem to be more concerned with their locations and adding cursing to the script then they do about the quality of the plot and script writing as well as directing the acting.  The whole ""we filmed it in the artic"" means nothing, you get one scene of Sam and Mitchell walking across the tundra and some aerial shots, big deal nothing makes up for a good plot or at least spend more on the special effects.  This is even becoming a formula for the Stargate movies, let's pick a cool location, and then have one or two of the character just walk while we fly around filming them and we can add an orchestra piece and that's really going to impress the audience, or are we impressing ourselves while making the film.  The problem is they are impressing themselves not the audience, it just slows down the film for the audience and the film is already too short for that, spend the time with plot development not impressing yourself with the location.  They think if they can impress us with their cute stuff, but nothing, nothing can replace a well thought out script and thoughtful dialog.  **spoiler** There are two examples of this that drove me crazy, one was when Jack is killed by Baal, don't you think after 8 seasons of building up the Carter/Jack relationship she might start crying or freaking out and then when Daniel falls through the ice is frost-bitten and they have to leave him behind to die, don't you think that might call for an emotional moment or some great final words before you leave a beloved member of the team to his death.  No we only get Daniel saying, ""Bye,"" that's it...great script writing, well thought out.  This is why this movie needed to be longer, this why they shouldn't focus so much on location and cute curse words, so you could fully develop the plot and script.

Richard Dean Anderson - OK most of us thought he was going to be a major part of the story, hello, why wouldn't you make him a bigger part of the story; he was the bedrock of the series.  Instead we get a couple of unremarkable cameo appearances, with goofy dialog and no substance.  That was a let down, especially since you advertised him so heavily as being in the film.

Effects - I really was expecting more effects then what we got.  I thought there was going to be a great battle scene in space or cities getting blown up, but not really.  It was a big let down for a short movie without much action, just the film makers trying to impress us with location, or planes and subs, etc.  It wasn't great.

I'm getting ripped off - Bottom-line, I love SG-1, I've seen every episode, but I really want thee show back... I'm not going to keep running out to buy these extremely short films.  It's a marketing scheme.  I'm sure they are making a lot more selling these DVDs then producing the show.  I'm done buying the films.  They just aren't worth it.  Put the show back on the air or why don't the ""movie makers"" just make a sci-fi stargate mini-series at least you would have time to fully develop the plot.

The movie itself had me captivated from beginning to end and I feel regardless of whether anyone has seen the series, this particular movie is captivating and inviting to viewers ignorant of the original series. In my view the main characters Jackson, Mitchell, Carter and Anderson possess average acting skills. Ba'al & Tealc are excellent. The plot was well planned and being a time travel fan my interest was obviously heightened by the story line. For the most part the effects are very good. (With a few glitches here and there.)

3174533,5,B0017MO10U,"Continuum works a timeline/time-travel plot which is very similar to that of Moebius (from the eighth season on TV). All's well that ends well - or so it seems. Can we be sure that we are back in the ""correct"" timeline in each of these SG-1 stories? The fish situation in O'Neill's pond (comparing Moebius vs. Threads) was treated none too subtly, for one thing.

While we awaited its release, the hype surrounding Continuum seemed to imply that individuals were disappearing at Ba'al's ""execution"" as a result of a change in a timeline such that they were not meant to exist in it.  Hasn't that hokey plotline been done before, and would the Stargate writers really do that to us?  At any rate, look who vanishes first.  And check out that special ""knowing"" look on Ba'al's face at the second disappearance.  Clearly there is a plan afoot.

Isn't one timeline - however it may branch off from another - just as valid as any other timeline?  The ""alternate"" Landry most adamantly addresses this idea to the SG-1 team who had somehow jumped into his timeline and is trying to ""fix"" things.  Further viewings bring more thinking on the matter.  Stargate consistently does that, ya think?  I so love this series for that, and one could not ask for better actors to move it along.

The writers are always exercising their collective intelligence to the extreme, and they have given us a consistent series of episodes over the years - filled with character development, irreverance, team spirit and reasonably good science.  Let's have one more movie that takes its time in these matters and allows the characters to enjoy each other more. And enough with alternate timelines and time travel already. That's been done to death.  Let O'Neill SO kick some Tokra butt, and have him and Carter finally get it on in the ""official"" timeline and retire to an ascended state, or at least the state of Minnesota. ""Fly Away"" by Bread would make a perfect ending song.",1217462400,,1952,4.739644970414201

The interaction between characters was great as always and the plot was entertaining.  It was great seeing ""the gang"" all back together.  I hadn't realized how much I'd missed new episodes of SG-1 until I saw the first scene. In the end I was only slightly disappointed.  My biggest (and really only) complaint was that I wish it had been longer.  It felt like a long episode, not a ""movie""  I would have preferred it was more like 198 min long instead of only 98 min.  I also wish Jack had featured a bit more prominently in the story instead of Cam.  Don't get me wrong, I like Cam alot (Ben Browder is awesome) but Jack has always been my favorite.

3174536,4,B0017MO10U,"I'm probably what would be considered a hard-core fan: I own all 10 seasons of the show on DVD and even some of the Fandemonium books. I watch episodes daily. I also think the show should have ended with the episode Threads and am not a big fan of the story ark in seasons 9 & 10 (don't like the Ori).

I was really excited about this movie and had been waiting impatiently for the DVD to come out for the past couple of months. I finally got the DVD yesterday and watched it last night with my husband, who enjoys the show (but is definitely not a hard-core fan). I did try to tone down my enthusiasm before watching the movie as I knew I was likely to be disappointed.

I did not enjoy Ark of Truth that much since I don't like the Ori, but I have to say I was not disappointed with Continuum. There were a few bits and pieces that bothered me and I'll have to find out if the things they did jive with the SG universe as we know it, and I always get confused with alternate timelines. But the movie was definitely enjoyable. It had a different feel from just a 2-part episode. The camera angles were different, the Arctic scenes were pretty cool. I'll definitely watch it again.

RDA's role was pretty minimal. I thought he was a bit too out there in the first and last scenes, but I did enjoy the scene with him & the team in the sub. That seemed more like the Jack of the early SG1 seasons.

I found the music to be a little too ""there"" at times, especially at the beginning of the movie. Basically, I noticed the music and wondered whether we really needed it. Might just be me over-analyzing things though.

I haven't watched all of the extras yet, but the ""making of"" extra was pretty nice and long, a definite improvement over the barren DVDs of the early seasons.

A good episode, but nothing more.  It was better than the first SG-1 Series Movie - Stargate Ark of Truth.  Just about anything would have been better than that first movie.

And where was the romance with Jack and Samantha?  We've all waited light years for something long-term to FINALLY happen between these two before one of the actors dies in real life.

Will we have to wait until the actors are in their 80's or 90's to see a real relationship bloom with these star-crossed and formerly military-restricted sweethearts where they can get it on for the long term?

The possibilities for comedy and creativity are endless if the creators of these series/movies take this next giant step.

If you make another movie please let Carter have a life with her beloved Jack.  It is just getting to be so one-dimensional.  The possibility of adding the depth of a real relationship between these two would really add to the dimension of this series.

Please don't let SG-1 go down in history like the real people in Washington, DC.  They have no lives.  I just moved away from there.  I spent the last 52 years of my life there.  I was born there and was enmeshed in the politics and workaholism of the Washington, DC mindset.

When I wanted to stop being a workaholic I searched for a Workaholics Anonymous in the DC area and NO ONE HAS STARTED ONE.  GO FIGURE!!!!!

Please let the SG-1 Characters have more of a life than their real governmental counterparts in the Washington, DC based government and military.  It's about time!!!!  There is more to life than power and prestige.  Jack and Samantha need to get it on.

It was great to see Teal'C and Daniel and the other regulars.  I marvel at Christopher Judge's physique each time he is on screen.  He is a wonderful actor also.  Best wishes from me to all of the actors, crew, writers, etc.

I do have a technical observation of the first half of the movie.  It was shot too dark.  It was far too difficult to see what was going on for most of what was happening at first in the Antarctic.  If a new printing is made of this movie you might want to lighten it up a bit.

It was with sadness that I read of the recent passing of Don S. Davis.  I hope he is smiling down from up above as so many of us enjoy seeing him once more in this movie.  May God Bless him and his family as they mourn his passing.

Thank you to Richard Dean Anderson and the rest of the team.  My family and I have Seasons 1-10 and we enjoy watching them over and over again.  The SG-1 Series has so much depth and creativity packed into each episode that I am sure it is hard to top the episodes with a movie.  But I hope you take my advice and add that missing component - Jack and Samantha together - and we want to watch :)",1217376000,4,2920,4.3290203327171906
3174543,3,B0017MO10U,"Spoiler Free Review

The Good:
This movie is much better than The Ark of Truth. The special effects are first rate. It was nice to see the old characters. You see a little more grit ie. blood and bad language. Overall it was enough to get my ""Stargate Fix"".  But not enough to recommend a buy. Buy if you want to complete your Stargate dvd collection. Otherwise, rent it.

Ben Browder is finally hitting his stride. His performance was much better in this movie. I stopped thinking of him as John Crichton and thought of him as Cam Mitchell. Claudia Black and Beau Bridges were outstanding.

The Bad:
The story felt very rushed and like a long tv episode.  There could easily have been a Continuum 1 and 2 if the writers would stop and develop the characters a bit more.  I think most fans prefer quality over quantity.

As much as love Richard Dean Anderson, his performance wasn't that great.  He is self aware on camera and his timing is slightly off. You could tell he's simply out of practice. I wonder if they were just too afraid to tell him.

The Ugly:
The amount of Botox used was incredible! RDA and AT have the same flat faced mask look thru most of the show. The result is that RDA seems sad and AT seems bored. We all know the whole cast is older. Stargate has been on what 13-14 years?  Why do they have to stay young?",1217376000,9,1332,4.313253012048193

Like the lack of snow on their coats when they slide and exit the ship in the beginning; although the whole Arctic photography was outstanding.  Then there was the 1929 ship, which was sitting way too high in the water to be carrying the chapa eye, but then that would have made the storyline more difficult.  Then there was the..........well you get the point.  But, hey, that's what a small, Canadian budget gets you.  The acting was outstanding from everyone.  Most notably from Valla, Te'alc, and Mr. Bridges.  Samantha seemed not too interested and Col. O'Neil was eye candy for old timer fans, but they didn't make the film any weaker.

3174549,4,B0017MO10U,"I was a bit disappointed with Ark of Truth.  The actors did a great job, but there were too many gaps in the story.  This, however, was a really, really good film.  It was fantastic to see so many people brought back for this one.  The special effects were great, and the actors did a great job, too.

It wasn't perfect, however.

People vanishing from an altered timeline...  That just doesn't happen.  There are infinite possible universes out there, and when travelling through time, you create a new branch.  You don't destroy things in the parallel universes.  It's a fundamental part of the Stargate universe.

Ignoring that, however, the film is terrific.  If you need your SG-1 fix, with plenty of action, special effects, and cast members, this delivers.  Great job by everyone.

Sci-fi Channel, Please make more!
Everyone else, Please buy this so they will!",1217376000,2,867,4.8493150684931505
3174550,5,B0017MO10U,"Following on the release of The Ark of Truth, Continuum is the second Stargate SG-1 movie to come to DVD.  Unlike Ark of Truth, Continuum is not potentially weighed down by having to overtly tie up loose ends left by the series. While, in fact, it does tie up a few loose ends rather nicely it also does something else: it brings Stargate SG-1 full circle.

The plot is classic SG-1: the last of the system lords Ba'al (played by the ever villainous Cliff Simon) is about to be executed with SG-1 and Jack O'Neill in attendance. Suddenly people start disappearing and SG-1 members Daniel Jackson, Samantha Carter, and Cameron Mitchell flee through the Stargate to a world where the Stargate never made it to America just before World War II thanks to Ba'al meddling with history. After facing alternate versions of people they know and being dismissed, Earth comes under attack from Ba'al, his queen Qetesh (aka Vala) and his first prime Teal'c.  The team must find out how Ba'al changed history and put it right...or else. Writer Brad Wright brings together two of the series' best threads: time travel and the threat of Goa'uld invasion together to bring the series not only full circle but what could also be called SG-1's greatest hits.

One of Continuums biggest pluses is that it brings the original cast back together. Richard Dean Anderson appears once again as General Jack O'Neill and while he does not appear in the entire film, his presence his certainly welcome and makes for a great addition to the film. Also returning for this film is the SGC's original leader, General Hammond. The late Don S. Davis makes his final appearance as Hammond in the film's alternate timeline and while it's a shame that he doesn't know the team in those scenes, his appearance (like O'Neill's) is a welcome addition to the film.

The big thrill of Continuum is watching familiar characters in the alternate timeline. It is here more then anywhere else that the film brings the series full circle. We get to see the Goa'uld system lords back together again even SG-1's first nemesis Apophis in a surprise appearance. On top of the alternate versions of Teal'c, Vala, Hammond, and O'Neill we get to meet alternate versions of Hank Landry and President Henry Hayes.  Landry is played masterfully by Beau Bridges who is able to make the lines between the ""real"" and alternate Landry's almost indistinguishable. Hayes, played by William Devane and last seen in SG-1's seventh season finale Lost City, is much the same as the ""real"" version we've met before; skeptical at first and then forced to face the incredible with a brave face. Their appearances are what separates Continuum from Ark of Truth and marks an improvement.

The film also makes a fine blend of the cerebral and action sequences. While ostensibly an action story, Continuum also takes moments to explore, on the personal level, the effects of seeing a world and people you know be almost completely different.  Yet when the film needs action it has action from submarines rising in the Arctic, to dogfights and gun battles the film shows what SG-1 could be at its best: intelligent and yet action packed.

The stand-out aspects of Continuum are the amazing location photography, special effects, and music. The location filming in the Arctic (done in below zero temperatures) is amazing, beautiful, and breathtaking all at once. Considering this is a relatively low-budget film it's an incredible addition and it makes the film feel even bigger in scope and scale.  Scope and scale are the purpose behind another one of the film's highlights: the special effects. From dozens (if not hundreds) of Goa'uld ships to dogfights and extensions and additions to sets, the special effects in Continuum continue SG-1's proud tradition of bring feature film quality effects to the small screen.  Then there's Joel Goldsmiths' score which like Ark of Truth evokes the epic feel of the film.  Each of these make Continuum stand head over heals above many of the direct-to-DVD sci-fi films released all the time.

The special features should please any SG-1 fan. There are two excellent behind the scenes documentaries, one about the making of the film and one dedicated to the Arctic filming. The one on the Arctic filming is especially interesting for allowing one to see the challenges of filming in one of the most remote places on the planet. The big star of the special features is the commentary by director Martin Wood and writer Brad Wright. Their commentary reveal both the joy, hardships, and difficulties of bringing Continuum to the screen.

Continuum is not only an excellent addition to SG-1 but brings the series full circle. From classic elements to the return of favorite characters and villains to outstanding photography, effects, and music Continuum takes what could have been a boring attempt to tie up the loose ends of the series and creates a action packed adventure.  Continuum may well the end of SG-1 and if it is, Continuum is it going out on top.",1217376000,3,5023,4.886016451233843
3174551,4,B0017MO10U,"It felt more like an episode than a movie. That certainly isn't bad the fact it was another entertaining movie, but it is bad in the fact we have to wait so long between movies. This was another closer episode. Last time it was the Ori, this time the last system lord, Baal. The story centers on Baal's symbiote being removed but then they find out it is another clone and the real one has impacted the timeline so that he can invade Earth. Good acting, sets, music as you would expect from a well produced series. Fortunately there were plenty of episodes during the series that left themself open to return visits. They either need to make the movies more like movies or better yet bring back the series. They obviously don't mind making the movies and they have had a break from the series grind for awhile. Whatever their decision I'm just happy to get either. Being a fan since the very beginning when it first started on Showtime, I look forward to the further adventures of SG-1. Good quality DVD but I had to play mine on a multi-region player to get it to work. It would not play on a standard DVD player. Great replayability.

However I purchased the DVD myself with American Dollars, Greenbacks, Bucks.  And I thoroughly enjoyed it!  Man, just about everybody returned in this one.  Even that HOT System Lord Nirrti, albeit for a brief moment.  Apophis was there too, but all too briefly for my taste.  Jack O'neill was there also, AND there was talk of cake!  But again, all too briefly for him as well.  However it was a most excellent show and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  We can all thank God for this particular production of Stargate ""Continuum""!

3174553,5,B0017MO10U,"Just finished watching it.  It really was terrific.  Some reviews are right, it has similar time travel themes from some of the shows, but it is done in new places and in new ways.  Seeing the cast from the past was great as well.  Definitely worth it, you'll want to watch it again soon after the first!",1217289600,2,304,4.280701754385965
3174554,5,B0017MO10U,"First, let me preface this by saying I hardly, if ever, write reviews--especially for movies. And also that I am going to leave out any and all spoilers when it comes to the movie itself, with the exception of it's very general plot. For those of you who have, for some reason, not bought this movie yet.

When I first heard that this movie was going to involve time travel and an alternate reality, I was skeptical just like you. But I must say that the team really came through on this movie in waulity, writing, and even directing.

Martin Wood is not my favorite Stargate director, but he did a really good job on this movie.

Where this film shines through most is in the interaction and dialogue between the characters. This movie delves deeper into the characters of Samantha Carter and Daniel Jackson than any full season of the television show. Also, Jack's brief part in the movie was well done, and he was, of course, just as funny as always.

The real star of the movie, though, was Cameron Mitchell. Those of you who think that the show lost something with the departure of Jack O'Neill may find that surprising. But this film does something that two seasons and another movie were never able to do. It allows Mitchell to come out on his own as a character. He finally falls into place as an important central character and steps out of Jack's long, daunting shadow.

I won't say more than that because I don't want to ruin anything for the fans.

I'm obviously not very good at this, so I'm going to end this simply by saying that this is a very good Stargate movie and it is better than Ark of Truth, which was somewhat limited by the pure amount of plot points it had to cover to satisfy the fans. I was extremely happy with it. My only complaint now is that since it was an alternate reality story, it didn't sate my SG1 craving! I wanted to see the team together working a problem throughout the movie, like they were on a regular mission. I miss that, and episodes with the whole team working together were precious few during the final two seasons.

Someone tell me there will be another movie!

If you are a Stargate fan, this movie will make you happy. There are plenty of tasteful cameos--one in particular that knocked my socks off a little--and more than one reference to obscure Stargate trivial, but I watched it with a friend who knew nothing about Stargate and afterwards he made it a point to tell me how much he enjoyed it and he is now going to make it a point to watch the show.

So, is the movie good? Yes. It is. It really is great. Buy it, rent it, watch it. That's the only way we are going to get another one, I think.",1217289600,3,2656,4.349494949494949
3174555,5,B0017MO10U,"I really enjoyed the first DVD, STARGATE - THE ARK OF TRUTH, but felt it was lacking in two areas:  1. no Jack and 2. the ""movie"" was no more than a standard two- or three-part episode.  Well, in STARGATE - CONTINUUM, Jack is back, in not one, but TWO roles!  And the story itself is more than satisfying.  It is bigger and better than episode, has all the stops pulled out, and retains all of the great elements we have come to know, expect, and love from Stargate.

In STARGATE - CONTINUUM, we find our friends called back from their various exploits around various galaxies to witness the execution of the last of the Ba'al clones, thus the final destruction of the System Lords.  But, as always, Ba'al has a trick up his sleeve, and the twists, turns, and fun begin.  This movie is classic Stargate at its finest, with timelines changed, history rewritten, and our heroes needing to save the day and put everything right.

Richard Dean Anderson is perfect in his reprisal of Jack.  I really miss Jack when he isn't there.  Anderson's timing, ingenuousness, and droll repartee are archetypal Jack, and just what we wanted.  Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, and Christopher Judge are all together again as SG-1.  Cliff Simon out does himself as Ba'al.  There are special appearances by Beau Bridges, the beloved Don S. Davis, William Devane, and pretty much anyone who has played a character over the last 10 years.  It was wonderful to see them all together again, bringing the story full circle and putting a nice, neat, exciting bow on the entire package.

STARGATE - CONTINUUM is fast-paced, action-packed and tons of fun.  The special effects are terrific, and definitely a cut above a typical episode (which are pretty good to begin with).  The settings and scenery are beautiful to watch, and are mostly shot on location.  You will find yourself cheering for our heroes, and wondering how they are going to get out of this mess and save the world, as always.  But, as always, they do.  And we wouldn't have it any other way.",1217289600,72,2060,4.685236768802229

3174557,5,B0017MO10U,"If you have ever enjoyed a single movie or episode of Stargate you will love this. Like everything Stargate you need to at least be familiar with the basic premise of the TV show to grasp it. That said, even if you haven't seen an episode in close to 9 years you will understand it enough to know you are in for a treat. It is dramatic, funny, and most of all a fun ride. My only complaint is its length. The 98 minutes goes by all too fast. I'd have been happy with another 10minutes, and ecstatic with an extra 20 to fully soak in the characters and story. Make no mistake in what time there is has been used well, but a few climactic scenes could have been lengthened a bit to stress the true direness of the situation.

The BD transfer is overall very good especially many of the arctic scenes. There was no doubt on those it was all on location. There are a few shots interspersed that look as if came from a standard definition stock most notable a couple of the airplane shots. The rest of the footage is standard fare for a BD transfer. The arctic shots truly are what sets the BD above and beyond the DVD copy. I just wish there was a digital copy included is my only real gripe.",1217289600,8,1188,4.165217391304348
3174558,3,B0017MO10U,"In Stargate Continuum, several actors from the past ten seasons of the show make an appearance, including the much anticipates Richard Dean Anderson guest spot. The movie does several things to separate itself from the the long running TV show such as adding a bit of spice to the language(there is some cursing) and give us a little bit more blood when it comes to the violence. Other than that, it really isn't that different from any 2-part or 3-part story arc from the episodes in the seasons. So essentially, instead of watching a movie, you are really watching a 3-part series finale without the restrictions put on it by a cable network for ratings purposes, which is actually kinda nice. The problem however, is that this story has been done before. If you have seen the SG-1 season finale of season 8, then you have seen this movie already, just with different characters in some spots. My problem with this movie is that it really isn't a movie it's just another episode, although I love the series, so of course it is fun to watch our favorite characters do what the do. But after awhile you begin to realize, as I have, that MGM has actually done nothing new with any of the Stargate franchises for about the last 3 years. The writers seem to suffer from ""copy & paste"" syndrome, or sheer exhaustion and can't give us anything new. It is hard, as a die-hard fan to notice this until you take the time to look back and see how you have gotten where you are. The perfect example of this? Star Wars Episode I. The first time I saw it after waiting in line for 36hrs I thought it was the best and coolest movie ever made. My anticipation of its release however, clouded my judgment. When I saw it the 3rd time I realized I hated Jar Jar Binks. I haven't watched that movie for almost 4 years now. I am fearful of the same happening with the Stargate SG-1 movies and the most recent season of Atlantis as well. I love watching and re-watching the first 8 seasons of SG-1 and first 3 of Atlantis but with these movies I don't think I will. They are enjoyable, but they have lost their magic and the awe that I felt at the end of seasons 6 and 7 when I though that SG was the best show on TV-and it was. But when You have a budget ten times greater than you did for the season finale of season 7, why can't you do more on screen? Many fans who are awaiting that ever elusive ""epic space battle"" will be disappointed because, despite the millions they spent on this film, it's not there. Like the title says, great quality with the sets, acting and effects, but there is nothing new. I guess the actors are getting paid too much now for the extra flair, but that's why I keep coming back, and that's why I will still buy this film, because I still have hope that the writers can give me not only a new and fresh story line, but something more grand and majestic than I've ever seen in outer space. (And with lots of explosions!)
Final thoughts:
Mildly Disappointed, yet entertained.
Grade: C+(I really hate to give this grade b/c I love SG-1 sooo much, but lets be real, it's just really not that great. Someone from Gateworld commented that this was the best story line ever for SG-1, but that makes me wonder if they ever watched any of the other time travel episodes. It's really NOT that different, if even at all. Unfortunately disappointed)",1217116800,9,3350,4.387459807073955

3174560,5,B0017MO10U,"In my humble opinion, this movie welcomely outshines Ark of Truth.  And I hope that further SG movies are of this same caliber or better.  While the Ark of Truth was simply too pat a solution to the problem of the Ori, Continuum has a manageable plot that can be dealt with satisfactorily in a hour and a half.  Even considering this, the one downside to Continuum to me is that it felt edited down, that is, while watching I got the sense that they cut out footage/story development to maintain the pace of the plot or to meet some time limitations.  Personally, this irritates my movie tastes.  I like character development/plot development just as much as action.  And I felt that an additional 10-15 mins to the movie to amplify some plot issues or highlight some interesting scenes would have been optimal.

I hope this doesn't give too much away, but there are some good, novel action scenes.  Particularly, there is a jet plane dog fight at night emphasis night, which I think adds novelty and an aesthetic appeal that cliched day time dog fights don't have.  In general, production values were much better than the TV series.

Cliff Simon was excellent as Baal.  The Goa'auld haven't been this cool since Anubis.  This really comes out in the Baal, Katesh, Teal'c relationship triangle that was very well acted and takes some unexpected twists.  Kudos to Claudia Black and Christopher Judge who was great as always.  Incidentally, Cliff Simon was really ripped.  I think this physicality added something to the character.  It gave Baal a physical embodiment of his mental, youthful flexibility that has always contrasted him with the other more arrogant, stagnant System Lords.

3174563,4,B0017MO10U,"Several weeks ago, I was invited to a Special Viewing of Stargate SG-1 Continuum.  I was, obviously, very excited and shocked that I was chosen to see the movie before it came out...  Plus, with all the reviews stating that this would be a typical SG1 episode (With Rick), I couldn't wait!  (What can I say, I'm a HUGE RDA fan!)...
The beginning of the movie was perfect.  To see the ""Old Gang"" together, again, made the opening that much more enjoyable!  Plus, RDA was great with the character moments, and just him being himself!  Trust me when I tell you that you will not be disappointed in the beginning...!
After the beginning of the movie, it seems that the writers had to ""cheat"" to allow the main characters to keep their memory of the altered time-line!  The other problem with the movie is that it seemed to be rushed to a certain degree!
I will admit that is was extremely nice to see so many old faces, but the problem was that there wasn't enough time to spend ""quality"" time with all of them, and the fact of the matter is that the writers had to keep the story moving!!  I will admit that they did, thankfully, have a few more character moments between the cast than in SG-1's ""Ark Of Truth"", but it still wasn't enough in my opinion.
Please do not get the idea that this movie was bad...  In fact, I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys the Stargate show, but at the end of the movie, you will feel like something was missing, and you'll want more, but you'll have to wait for another Stargate movie to be made!!  (BTW, don't forget to look at Col. Mitchell's locker...  Something will have changed; can you see what it is?)  What was it Jack O'Neil said, ""Even us humans know time travel is nothing but trouble...!""
In any case, I would still recommend this movie to any Stargate SG-1 fan, but in my opinion, I believe that ""Ark of Truth"" was a better movie, though not by much!  However, I will be purchasing this movie, and hope you all do the same!  Besides, if we all purchase this movie, then MGM may make more SG1 movies!

The movie sets up scenarios that aren't resolved to satisfaction.

The worst thing about the movie is that Jack is getting fat.  I know, doesn't really have much to do with the movie per se, but it was depressing nonetheless.  You'll get to see a few old familiar faces, some of whom were killed off long ago, and the alternate timeline thing works really well.  The special effects are top-notch.

3408221,5,B0017MO10U,"For all of us Stargate fans of many years running, ""Continuum"" may well be our last viewing of the cast we have enjoyed for so long, at least all doing Stargate. Whereas ""Ark of Truth"" wrapped up the storyline unfinished when the series ended, ""Continuum"" gives us closure on the last System Lord on the loose ... the ever elusive Baal. Baal was a good choice to end Stargate stories with. Surprisingly charming and engaging despite his predilection for absolute evil, using him for this finale casts a fitting salute to the ongoing System Lord arc which had such sturdy legs in carrying the series year after year.

Here the SG-1 team returns to Earth on the heels of mysterious circumstances to find that Earth as they know it has changed in ways both subtle and dramatic. Although the people they should know, but don't, believe them, they are completely unwilling to take any action to set things ""right"" ... in fact quite the opposite. The most damaging change is the lack of a Stargate program, and when the System Lords show up to begin their bombardment of Earth, it becomes obvious to everyone that they should have paid more attention to the returning SG-1 members!

The blu-ray presentation is beautiful ... reference quality. Sound and effects are at the typical blu-ray level of magnificent. Obviously, I have not the slightest technical quibble with this presentation.

As the ""Star Trek: TNG"" finale reminded us, all good things must come to an end. If this is the last Stargate story we see from our beloved original cast, it was a satisfying and fitting curtain call.",1503360000,5,1584,4.773722627737226

It did finish the story line for Baal which was good to have finalized, since the last season didn't show what happened to the last of his clones.",1488931200,,435,4.190476190476191

3408583,5,B0017MO10U,"I hated when Jack (Richard Dean Anderson) left the show so I was happy to see his role revisited in this movie even though it he was not featured.

I am a big fan of Stargate SG-1 and was saddened when it went off the air therefore when the movies came out I was happy.  This particular one is a nice continuation of the characters, but can be watched and followed even if you had never seen a Stargate SG-1 show before.",1400976000,,420,4.109756097560975
3408584,5,B0017MO10U,This was a really good movies. It ties off the Baal story line quite nicely. Wish they'd make more Stargate movies.,1400803200,,115,4.523809523809524
3408585,4,B0017MO10U,"Having never watched the TV series, I wasn't familiar with the characters, but that didn't matter. OK special effects. Nothing to write home about. Not a big mind twister, either, but entertaining enough.",1400544000,,204,5.212121212121212

However, You will need to have followed some earlier episodes of Stargate to fully understand this movie.
For me that was not a problem.",1397692800,,169,4.666666666666667
3408592,1,B0017MO10U,The acting is horrible!!! I could only stomach about 15 minutes of it and that was torturous enough. Maybe I'm a little bit of a glutton for pain but that is just me. Maybe there are people out there who can watch this and be ok with it. I can't so there you have it!!,1397520000,,268,3.890909090909091

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes this genre.",1397260800,,273,4.372549019607843

3408596,4,B0017MO10U,"Decent story!  So-so acting....not that I am an actor, but then again I am not paid 6 to 7 figures for doing a movie either --- maybe use some of that money for acting lessons.  Of note, M. Shanks -- definitely deserves kudos.  Believable and, in my opinion, hit the mark on authenticity .  The others' acting seemed forced (Beau Bridges), while others seemed too comfortable (yes you, Richard Dean Anderson) in their role -- it made for an uneven overall perception of the movie's performance.  The story line was decent which kept me awake for the entire movie; I tend to drift during movies that follow the original.  But this one was ok.
Would I recommend this movie to a friend, definitely....will I watch it again, probably not.",1396656000,,734,4.651162790697675

3408601,1,B0017MO10U,Terrible... Couldn't make it past the first 15 minutes. Juvenile acting; Anderson looked like he was participating in a bad high school play.,1395705600,,141,5.173913043478261

3408603,2,B0017MO10U,I am a fan of all things Stargate. But this episode is a total bummer. We are supposed to believe that just a few cosmetic time changes - or is that cosmostic? - time changes warp and twist everyone's character from hero to zero. The warped characters of the other-dimensional Stargate regulars are all losers. Guess we better stick to our own dimension!,1394755200,,354,4.634920634920635

3408610,4,B0017MO10U,"A good story for those already familiar with the Stargate SG-1 season 9 and 10 characters  for those not so familiar, much of the en-passant humor is lost, particularly interactions between Ben Browder and Claudia Black.",1394064000,,220,5.111111111111111

3408614,2,B0017MO10U,"The ending never really ties everything up...Beginning of the movie, for about 10 minutes, is so dark that you have a hard time figuring out what's happening...In the end you ask yourself 'how did that ....?'.",1393459200,,209,4.833333333333333

3408616,3,B0017MO10U,"The movie and plot are not as good as the original movie, many aspects of the plot are unexplained and even rather silly.  It is very much a product of Hollywood's approach to Science Fiction, which does not seem to give serious or knowledgeable writers a chance to contribute.  There are exceptions, particularly in more recent years, but Continuum has the feel of a '50s movie.",1392854400,,379,4.7272727272727275

3408757,5,B0017MO10U,"It's mid-2012 and I've watched this film about 5-6 times by now.  As far as reviews go, I give Continuum 5-stars as a fine sci-fi B-movie with the understanding that B-movies should be judged within their own category.  Due to budget constraints, this work went direct to DVD and was never intended as a major theatrical release; many of those who wrote very negative reviews apparently did not understand this. True, there was no award-winning score, parts of the film seemed rushed, we couldn't spend enough time with our beloved characters and there were plot holes you could drive a truck through, but who cares? This is SG-1 on another mission to save the galaxy, there's no time for all that other stuff!

I thought Continuum was the perfect end to the franchise but had my fingers crossed when they rebooted the series with Stargate Universe, a show that went down in flames and deservedly so (though the final two episodes got it right, just too late). There comes a time when all good things must come to an end; for Stargate, it was with Continuum.

Side Note: It was nice that they gave Claudia Black a completely different character, a very juicy role as bad bad girl who ends up slicing her husband (a system lord no less) in half -- vertically -- from head to -- uh -- the family jewels. Now THAT's just plain mean!

I wish we had more entertainment of this caliber; you know, good guys vs. bad guys, good guys win.  I think that's why this show appealed to adults just as much as it did to the kids. These characters had principles, morals and stood up for the the things they believed to be right and true -- no moral ambiguity, no relativism, no philosophical navel-gazing. More importantly, they were family and some of us considered them a part of our family.

As he stood near the gate entrance ramp to give last-minute orders to SG-1 and see them off on yet another dangerous mission, General Hammond would always impart these final words as the team entered the gate:

I have just completed my viewing of all ten Stargate SG-1 seasons and the two movies: Ark of Truth and Continuum. Regarding the seasons, I despised the episodes that were silly and comical. Fortunately there were only a few, and therefore they should not dissuade you from watching the other episodes. Certainly Stargate SG-1 is one of my favorite TV series. It's right up there with Star Trek NG, Star Trek Voyager, Star Trek Enterprise, 4400, Battlestar Galactica, and Smallville.

The two Stargate movies are also very good, with one important qualification. To get full appreciation of the movies, you should have familiarity with the series. I think the last three seasons--8, 9, and 10--should suffice, though of course all ten seasons would be best. Also, you should watch Stargate: The Ark of Truth after watching Season 10 and before watching Stargate: Continuum.

Another reviewer says that Stargate: Continuum feels a bit rushed. I agree, but I neither condemn the movie nor lower my rating of it for that reason. As happened in a number of the Stargate episodes, sometimes the viewer needs to fill in details. Sometimes you get only a few words explaining what happened. But if you are attentive, if you have familiarity with the Stargate universe, and if you have a decent science-fiction imagination, you should be all right.

Again, I think Stargate: Continuum was a very good movie. As I write, it stands as the conclusion of the Stargate SG-1 epic, and I am pleased with it.",1309132800,,1506,4.894117647058824

What accucally caught my eye was the Browder/Black acting team. If Mr. Browder was Han Solo in FARSCAPE, then he is Indiana Jones in SG:C",1298419200,,293,4.345454545454546

This was basically a two part stargate episode with a  higher budget and it was one of the last things that Don Davis ever filmed before his death. He played General Hammond and many other characters during his career of course. (rip d.d.) Anyways this is in no way deserving of bad reviews IF you like stargate sg-1. It's a average tale for the team as they travel through time, personally I would have liked a nontime travel story for their final adventure. Sadly At this date I can't see them making another one. I wish they would though. The blu ray looks stunning and it's a even better deal on the two movie pack with 'the ark of truth' blu ray. I still have hopes for this series to be on blu ray but that's not happening at this time. However the excellent series ""space 1999' has made it to blu ray and that's a plus. ALthough it doesn't help us sg fans!  Anyways I enjoyed this movie but it's not the best story of this series by far. This one is for sg fans all the way and that's who should want this one the most.

The first half is lacking in action, and you don't see much of O'Neill in this one. He shows up in the first few minutes of the film and the last few, but that's it. And the story is lacking in structure. The second half of the movie wasn't that bad, but still not worth wasting your money on.

3408778,4,B0017MO10U,"STARGATE: ARK OF TRUTH more or less wrapped up the Ori portion of SG-1 and STARGATE: CONTINUUM does pretty much the same thing with the Gou'ald arc.  I think this is appropriate, given that the Gou'ald started off the movie that anticipated the series.  There aren't a lot of Gou'ald left at this point, only Ba'al. But at least they go out with a bang, with an innovative, fun, interesting story.  The first two post-SG-1 movies have not been masterpieces, but they have both been very good.  This is no mean feat.  If you contrast it with the various BABYLON 5 movies, the SG-1 movies have been far superior.  This despite the fact that BABYLON 5 was a far more impressive show.  The two SG-1 movies have been so successful that a third is now in the works.

Hopefully that movie will have more involvement with my favorite member of the SG-1 team, Claudia Black.  I'm not quite certain where her pregnancy fell in the filming schedule, whether she had it immediately before filming or if she had it afterwards, but it did mean that she was not fully available.  Her diminished role hurt the show some.  I always felt that SG-1 improved sharply as soon as she joined the series.  She brought both a sexiness and some humor that had been missing before she arrived.  Hopefully she will play a much more prominent role in this film.

The financial success of these two movies are great news for SF fans everywhere, even if they don't follow SG-1.  The DVD industry hasn't quite figured out what to do with direct-to-DVD.  There are a lot of niche markets that could support direct-to-DVD films.  The success of the SG-1 films might, for instance, mean that long hoped for sequel to SERENITY (though the ongoing success of various cast members -- Nathan Fillion, Summer Glau, Gina Torres, Adam Baldwin, and, most recently as main face of the alien invaders on V. [though she also had a prominent role on SG-1], Morena Baccarin].

I haven't read through all of the reviews so maybe someone else has mentioned this problem. Basically, as of this review, the voices/sound of the actors on the dvd is horrible. It's as though they ran out of money so they couldn't afford to overdub the actors voices and simply went with the sound that was recorded in the scene no matter how bad it was, ie; reverb, echos, barely audible, etc. I gave it 3 stars just because I love Stargate and the actors, but it's sad to think they are ending these adventures with this substandard last entry.",1247184000,,823,4.7622377622377625

While the idea is very good, I'm sorry to say the movie was profoundly very tedious, not as exciting as I hoped. So if you want alternate universes please check Star Trek Deep Space Nine or the books in which the idea is used.

3408786,4,B0017MO10U,"The ending of the ""Stargate SG-1"" TV show left some threads dangling -- the last Goa'uld System Lord was still in hiding, and the Ori were still threatening the world.

Fortunately the Goa'uld plot threads are more or less tied up in ""Stargate: Continuum,"" the second of the two Stargate direct-to-DVD movies. This movie is a bit of a mind-bender (especially with all the time-skipping and temporal wrinkles) but it brings back all the favorite characters (and some dead ones) and finishes the story off in true Stargate style.

SG-1 and General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) are watching the execution and extraction of Ba'al... but unfortunately, it's not the real Ba'al. The real Ba'al has time-traveled and altered the timeline, causing Teal'c (Christopher Judge), Vala (Claudia Black) and the Tok'ra to vanish, and resulting in Jack's death.

Unfortunately, this alternate timeline becomes more perilous after a year -- Earth is being threatened by the supreme System Lord Ba'al, his queen Qetesh (in Vala's body) and his First Prime Teal'c. But when Qetesh and Ba'al clash over his past on Earth, the altered SG-1 must band together to find and destroy Ba'al's time machine, and somehow restore the timeline to what it once was. Or to something resembling it.

""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" and ""Stargate: Continuum"" are basically intended to wrap up loose ends, and as a standalone story ""Stargate Continuum"" is not quite as satisfying as the television show was. And frankly, ""Continuum"" may need multiple viewings to keep up with the time-bouncing plotline -- it scrambled my brain on the first time.

But as a finale, it serves the Goa'uld storyline well -- lots of action, space battles, ""snakeheads,"" and a way bigger budget that a TV episode would ever have allowed. And it has everything that you'd expect from ""Stargate SG-1"" -- icy strandings, some recurring characters (Apophis!), and alien nasties with overwhelming power. There's less of a moral dilemma here, but it's still pretty good.

It also has excellent scripting: plot threads drawn from the TV series, witty dialogue (""That is, after all, why we've come. Why we had to endure all of that singing. Get rid of the last bad guy and then there's cake""), and some nice quiet moments, such as Teal'c talking with Tomin about their bloodstained pasts. And they manage to throw some interesting twists at the audience, such as a shocking revelation about the Ori.

And seeing the actors as their SG-1 characters is like putting on a comfortable old shoe. Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks are suitably brilliant and courageous, and Ben Browder gets to shine as a strong, slightly quirky soldier. Meanwhile, both Christopher Judge and Claudia Black are impressive as their ""alternate timeline"" selves who are still part of the Goa'uld empire.

And of course, Richard Dean Anderson utterly steals the show whenever he appears (""Hey, have you ever tried to find a bathroom in a pyramid?"") and this is the last appearance of Don S. Davis as General Hammond. Rest in peace.

It's a little sad to see the main storylines of the Stargate universe end, but ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" and ""Stargate: Continuum"" are well worth seeing. Nice finales.",1242259200,6,3216,4.996261682242991

3408802,4,B0017MO10U,"There are several reasons to watch Continuum:

Jack is back and gets `into it' with Baal.
We finally wrap the 10 year storyline of the System Lords.
General Hammond returns, but sadly in his final role.

Baal changes time to a degree where the Stargate program never got started, the Gate is lost and this opens the door to the Goauld invasion.  Our heroes, with the earlier timeline in their memories (somehow??) fail to convince their counterparts in this timeline until it's practically too late.  Can Tealc be counted on?

Edge of your seat suspense - great Air Force jet shots.  This story would almost be a regular episode but the production values are superior to what I've seen on SciFi Channel.

Great special effects, space battles and a somewhat twisty time-travel storyline brings the gang together for one final leap in the Stargate universe.

I really hope they bring back more movies.  I hear there's a new spinoff which is written by the same guys who wrote Stargate SG-1.  Can't wait.

The Layman's Guide to Time Travel segment was rather enjoyable as an actual Astrophysicist describes some of the fundamental concepts behind time travel and the use of Einstein-Rosen bridges (aka wormholes). The Grandfather paradox also played a short role in the film, but many questions were still left unanswered although the viewer can assume the path of events (namely Mitchell's return to 1939 and how the other Mitchell figures out the events at the end of the movie). It was an excellent Stargate movie but the overall feel still seemed like a long series finale rather than a motion picture caliber film.

I have watched every episode of this series at least once; some twice or even three times, if they are exceptional!
But what I cannot stand is being taken for a chump!
I am not going to go into a detailed review of these two ""Straight to DVD movies"".  There are more than enough posts to cover the bogus, rehashed plot elements.
I am briefly going to cover one important fact.  The Stargate & Company franchise's attitude to their viewers: ""To hades with you, give us your money chimp!""
This is the formula that is truly in place for the continuation of Stargate & Company!
They were supposed to release these movies on DVD and then air them on SciFi.  Greed entered the picture; and now it's like waiting on some lost Orson Welles masterpiece to finally be aired on telelvision.  Well, this is not masterpiece--though I wish it were lost.
To think of all the time spent by so many viewers of the show, and then these schmucks do not end the series; they just want to force everyone to buy a DVD that ends the series; but wait, it doesn't end it so you have to buy ""Continuum"" to have an ending.  But they are already trying to assemble the original cast for a third ending?  How many endings to we have to have?  As many as shall make them so comfortable they can buy their own Stargate! :(
And if you doubt my assessment, then you need only know that Stargate Atlantis is ending after only five seasons.  They are going to film a movie continuing their battle with the Wraith (the Goua'uld with bad, blue skin problems); this we are told shall air on Scifi, then go to DVD.  And if this promise is kept?  What about after?  I bet no more Scifi first airings.  Oh no: straight to DVD, and we may never see Atlantis movies on Scifi again.  Not that that wouldn't be a tragedy.  But the idea I am to shut up and buy a DVD to find out the ending of a show takes you and me for utter imbeciles.
In short: they can take the whole franchise, along with the con, and shove it up their ""stargate hole""!
And a third series is in the making: ""Stargate Universe"" or something like that.  It shall air on Scifi.  If it's successful, welcome to Ori-hell.  It's end without ending; and shall go to ""DVD movie of the week status!""  Just like these.
Idiotic.
We should all ""dial-out""; and leave Stargate as a very bad memory.  Sort of like roasted Prior, without the parsely!  Stick a fork in ""it"", and this franchise!  It is done . . .

I have been a Stargate SG1 and Stargate Alantis fan for years.  It was cool to see them together for a brief few moments but then it turned out to be another episode.  Where was the originality, the interaction, the character development?  This movie could have rocked the house instead I went and made dinner.  Returning to realize I didn't need to rewind.  Admittedly, I did rewind the first time but then didn't bother for the second and third.  I was getting bored.

Production values are excellent.  Scenes hinted at in previous episodes regarding a massive invasion of earth by space are finally seen, and they do an excellent job of portraying earth under attack by space.

Virtually every old enemy re-surfaces in the movie due to the altered timeline story, and it is refreshing to see the familiar 'baddie' characters reprising these roles, even if only briefly.

You'll appreciate this movie the most if you see it after watching the main stargate series, obviously.  But the pacing, the interesting story, great special effects, and the excellent performance by Cliff Simon as Baal really make this a wonderful science fiction production in general.

And though the movie is theater-quality production, the hi-def transfer is definitely low tier. Dark areas are grainy and many shots are less than clear. It's also worth a pause when Daniel Jackson looks at the back cover of a book he published in the alternative timeline. Clearly no one thought anyone would do it as no care is made in the editing or writing of text.

It would have been great if they threw in an appearance of the Russian commander that were in earlier StarGate episodes. Also, I wish Jack had a little more animosity towards Ball - after all, he did torture him more than any human ever (previous episodes). And in fact, after the torture episode is when Jack became more sarcastic. The writers probably did not even realize the timing of this slight character change. Jack is, through his sarcasm, still no doubt hiding the psycological pain of the torture Ball inflicted on him.

The way this story happened - as a result of Ba'al trying to manipulate an entire galaxy just to save himself from being destroyed (how self-absorbed the Goau'ld can be) - seemed very in-line with the Stargate universe and a natural adventure SG-1 would have.

I was a huge Farscape fan (have all of their DVDs), so when we went to Stargate SG1 to Stargate SG1.3 I accepted the ""Bump"" and was sorry to see it wind down.
My only problem with both the regular and Blu-Ray DVDs was that Amazon gave me tracking numbers for both products, (which were pre-ordered), and the Postman had nothing to deliver for a month or so-both were in transit. I hope this means that MGM made a tidy profit and more will follow.

I think with ""Continuum"" they tried a little too hard to do something different. The idea was interesting, but the old time travel thing used so often in sci-fi was a little too stale here. Plus it seems to have detracted from what makes the show work: the characters. While some characters stayed themselves, others changed and were marginalized (Vala and Teal'c for example). Obviously when a series and contracts end it's hard to get all the actors back for a new project at the same time, but I think they could have kept the ""team"" dynamic that made Stargate work.

3408856,5,B0017MO10U,"First of all, my advice would be to completely ignore the negative reviews.  Continuum is a great addition to the Stargate story.

The movie has a very good story line and plenty of action.  It is not ""dumbed down"".  By that, I mean it leaves some things up to your imagination and thought process.  The flashbacks in time are kept to a minimum.  The special effects are great without being outrageous as in some movies.

The movie does have a bit more foul language than the rest of the Stargate episodes. Then again, it is kept to a minimum and used only in times of great distress.  It is still suitable for children, though.

I would like to have seen more of Apophis and the rest of the bad guys.  An appearance by Bra'tac as an advisor to Teal'c would have been nice.

At any rate, I think every person that is a true fan of Stargate will enjoy this movie.",1221782400,,862,4.291925465838509
3408857,4,B0017MO10U,"First: I love the Stargate series and have the entire collection on DVD. Stargate is the best SiFi series ever created. Continuum was a needed fix for any SG1 junky.  I hope that there are many more SG1 movies to come or better yet, bring the series back for a few seasons....
Second: What happened with Richard D. Anderson, Brigadier General, USAF? He was advertised to play a larger role in this movie not a small teaser appearance. It felt like he didn't want to be there. Many feel that his wise cracks and ""poke fun at the man"" attitude portrayed by his character made the show. I am not knocking Gen. Anderson; he is one of the best actors of the 20th / 21st century. But if he is going to play O'Neill please do it full force or don't tease the fans.
Third: I thoroughly enjoyed the movie but the magic was subdued. This would have made a great TV Special Event to be released on DVD after it aired. Billing this as a ""Major Motion Picture Event"" is misleading. The ""lost in time"" and ""alternate time line"" has been done to death. With the entire universe just one Stargate step away why rehash an old story line. This was a missed opportunity to WOW the fans and pick up more followers.

We turned out the lights and watched it on my 55"" flat screen like we were at the movies. It has all the big picture feel to it, so one wonders why it didn't go to theatres? The fan base is huge and I would have paid for it.

Anyhow, it starts off well, moves into the plot line and just kind of loses its interest. we are supposed to believe that three SG 1 characters just give up and go along with the powers that be. totally unbelievable. then they need them and call them back...lame. Claudia Black had a good time (doesn't she always?).

3408873,5,B0017MO10U,"If you are a Stargate SG1 fan you will definately want to purchase this movie. I have been a fan since the beginning with the original Stargate with Kurt Russel. I usually have found spin offs lacking from original releases but I just fell in love with this series and how the charactors all interact and bring out the best in each others charactors. I found Stargate Continuum to possess a fantastic storyline that keeps you captivated through out the movie. My only critical point is that the ending kind of comes up abrupt, kind of ""huh"" its over. I still loved this and will add it to my Stargate collection. A word of caution to potential buyers - there are bad imitations from market place sellers so beware. Amazon.com took great care of me as I was one who got taken from a low price and recieved a bootleg copy with sub titles you can not turn off. I then purchased from Amazon.com and recieved a perfect ""New DVD"". Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did",1220745600,,967,4.377777777777778

3408875,4,B0017MO10U,"""Continuum"" is a to-be-expected episodic continuation of the SG-1 series.  It doesn't fill in any gaps or danglers left from the series as did the DVD-only release for ""The Ark of Truth."" The quality and story is top-notch as always although it's more of a small-screen episode. The extra features certainly make it worth watching (Amanda Tapping and submarines... by way of e.g.), if not purchasing for a home library.

The biggest thing about SG-1 is that it was such a compelling episodic piece that TV without it is bland... just as when the Star Trek serials were killed off by the bean counters, or BSG by it's regenerators... at least there's ""Stargate Atlantis"" for now... and the hopefully continuing DVD-only pieces like ""The Ark of Truth"" and ""Continuum.""

3408880,4,B0017MO10U,"This is the second movie after the conclusion of SG-1. It is a little more like a movie (rather than a long episode) because they are not finishing a story arc from the series.  Admitedly, they're still dealing with pre-established characters and situations.

It starts off with the team (and Jack O'Neill--hooray!) going to watch Baal, the last of the system lords, being forcibly removed from his host.  Baal tells the team that he is actually the last clone of Baal and that the real Baal has something special planned now that the final cloned symbiote is about to die.  Now the team, used to this sort of nonsense from Baal, don't believe him (I wouldn't either).  But then Teal'c disappears into thin air (casting darker doubts upon Vala's sudden absence from moments before).

Now, I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so I'm just going to tell you what you ought to know from the cover anyway.  It involves time travel and an alternate timeline. We see many familiar faces too, including some of the other system lords and Hammond. And, as always, there is lots of typical stargate comedy.

Having said this much, I assume that those who have seen the series (seasons one through ten) will be able to imagine what sorts of events go on (even if the particulars aren't all laid out for them).  Those who have not will be surprised (if perhaps a little confused).  As always, it helps in the watching of this film if you have a solid background with the characters and the events of the TV series.

I must say that I enjoyed it very much and would suspect that many sci-fi fans would be able to jump right in and see it.  Hope you like it too.",1220745600,,1654,4.494983277591973

Ben Browder does add his own ""spin"" to the show but it just wasn't the same.  The movie gives you the best of both characters but still leaves you wanting to see more of Jack.  I hope they will continue to make movies for the fans to see and hopefully will continue to incorporate both characters into the story line.  This movie was good but a little hard to follow sometimes, but then it wouldn't be SG-1 if it wasn't now would it?

Somehow, they managed to get practically all of the actors portraying the various heros and villians over the years back together for the story. For example, there are lots of cameos by all the best ""System Lords"" we loved to hate in the TV show.

If you're a Stargate fan, you won't want to miss this.

Like a lot of the episodes, SG-1 gets itself into a pretty deep pickle before finally coming through in the end, but it's a good story and certainly worth watching.

Made only for DVD and relying on special effects did not result in a good movie...
The Stargate Continuum movie we ordered from Amazon dot com still has to arrive at our house in Bandung Java. We watched it on BluRay hired from a local video DVD shop......and it is hoped this is pure co-incidence. Amazon US's customer care center tells us that both the Stargate Continuum order and another for 3 standard DVD's were shipped via DPGM (most likely Deutsche Post) and that the problem might be with the Indonesian Postal service. Considering we've never had a problem with the local labour intensive Indonesian postal people, I'd be of the opinion that there has been a gltich somewhere else. DVD's ordered via Amazon.co.uk arrive at our place within days from the United Kingdom. We've given it another try for some more blu-rays....fingers crossed I hope these will get here without ""going missing"".
Amazon in the US and UK have great web-sites and good service...let's hope those who are entrusted with  delivieries will keep their act ""clean""!

The title there is a joke since this is the third movies in the series, along with The original feature that spawned the series, and the ""Ark of Truth.""  I enjoyed the movie, but not as much as I expected. The twists in the end caught me off guard, because you won't expect what eventually happens to resolve the storyline. It felt a little bit cheap, like a 2 part TV episode more than a epic movie finale. On the other hand if, it didn't end the way it does, then it would have felt like a rehash of a previous episode. You'll know what I'm talking about if you see it.

Time travel movies are always eeh at points because let's face it we have no idea how real or fake some situations might be. However this alternate time plot really gives this movie a great deep story and with the main bad guy being Bal, it's an instant classic. Definitely better than the first SG-1 DVD, The Ark of Truth, although completely different story but I have to say I like them both for what they are as well.

The movie was completely lacking in emotional exploration of the characters.  Delving into the character impact of separation and isolation in an alternate reality, and in the case of Daniel, the loss of a limb, might have added 10 minutes of time, but it would have significantly improved the movie.

Continuum was just plain fun. Which is what I loved about SG-1. The reason I gave it four instead of 5 stars is because the whole going back and changing the time line thing's been done almost to death. Though they did manage to portray the characters as outside of time in a fresh way. Aw, what the hell. I'll give it the fifth star.

3408955,5,B0017MO10U,"Back To The Old Orifice Again

Rick Anderson, aka MacGyver, playing his alter ego, Jack O'Neill, in his breakout Sci-Fi show ""Stargate, SG1"" has previously referred to the Stargate as the ""Old Orifice"" with great nostalgia.
Even though the ""gate"" never attained the same reverence as the ""U.S.S. Enterprise"" did in the original Star Trek Sci-Fi show, it is without a doubt the single most important artifact of the popular show.
In the ""Stargate"" world, the limits of the gate led to more conventional forms of transportation during story development. The SG1 teams were later able to choose to travel via spaceships or even be scrambled and beamed ala Star Trek. However, it is ""the old orifice"" that takes center stage in this romp back through time.

Many of the unique features of the gate are presented which lead to problems that even the Ancient builders never seemed to bother fixing. For instance, why is every gate traveller subjected to being dumped on the other side of the wormhole without so much as a cheap shield that would protected them from a hostile greeting party?
As this scenario plays out, we discover that getting there really is the only fun part. Stargate's slickest bad guy, Bal'l, is back in form as the universe's biggest pain in the gate. While the entire team doesn't operate together in the beginning of the story every one is brought together near the end...for the ""do over"" of a lifetime.
 This is the best ""after series"" movie to date and captures the spirit of the early ""gate"" adventures.
If only B'all had brought along a personal shield the entire world would have turned out...well, you buy the movie and find out for yourself.",1219708800,,1669,4.788194444444445

3408973,4,B0017MO10U,"It's amazing what can end up coming from a simple movie. Back in 1994 a science fiction epic called Stargate hit the big screen. Written by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, and directed by Roland Emmerich, this movie ended up becoming a huge franchise.

Novels based on the original movie, Stargate SG1, Stargate Atlantis, an animated series called Stargate Infinity, books based on both television series, a D20 modern Role Playing Game, an impending Massive Multiplayer online game, comics, a rumoured third TV series and of course two direct to DVD movies.

This review is about the second direct to DVD movie, called Continuum.

As per usual, this review contains no spoilers other than what you might have seen in trailers or what you gleaned from the back cover. I don't like spoiling things for people.

The movie takes places shortly after the end of the series, and deals with the capture and the end of the last System Lord.

What appears to be a simple ceremony, one that would end with the extraction of the Symbiote, ends with what appears to be the re-writing of history.

Yes, it's a time travel movie, and it has all the elements any fan of science fiction would expect. Once again, I will not give away any spoilers about these elements or the rest of the plot itself.

Anyhow, in a way, the movie was a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting something a little more - well, epic in scale.

Hey, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, and even though I prefer Stargate Atlantis, it was good seeing the return of Richard Dean Anderson and all the rest of the regular cast.

Even Teal'c's former master.

Sorry, I digress.

Anyhow, the point of the matter is that this movie seemed to be nothing more than a two part episode that had been left over from the series... a two part episode that they had wanted to film, but for some reason it got pushed to the back burner and was never included in one of the last seasons.

Still, it had a good budget that allowed for the return of all your favourite characters (see above), and excellent special effects.

The funny thing is, even though it was direct to video, and had probably a slightly larger budget than normal for an episode, this movie was leaps and bounds better than a lot of direct to DVD movies that have come out in the recent past, ones that had budgets that probably far surpassed that of the one for this movie.

And Continuum was better, worth far more of your hard earned dollars than these others that I have hinted at, but will not name at this time.

This simple fact boggles my mind.

For those of you who happen to miss SG1, it's a nice visit from characters you've grown to love over the years and have missed since the end of the final season. It's almost a homecoming if you will for fans of the original series.

Frankly put though, The Ark of Truth was a better movie, but then again, it was produced to wrap up several story arcs.

This was more of a stand alone, almost a `thank you, here's one more adventure through the gate for all the loyal and loving fans'.

Personally, I really hope that we'll see more Stargate movies in the future. It'll be wonderful to see `old friends' once again.

Now, as to the bonus features included on the DVD - you have the ever present commentary with Brad Wright and Martin Wood, as well as three featurettes. The first is the Layman's Guide to Time Travel; the second Stargate goes to the Arctic and finally the Making of Stargate Continuum.

For rapid and casual fans alike.

My wife, who is the big stargate fan, was also.  She watched it a second time and said she was glad she bought it ... after being really disappointed on the first viewing.

If this were the only stargate show, I would not have any desire to watch another.

My wife and I had settled down to watch good entertainment and I really was not at all happy with what I saw.  It seemed confusing to me how they were pulling elements from different times and trying to put them under a single time.

3408978,5,B0017MO10U,"For fans of the first eight seasons of SG-1, this is a must-have. Not only is the filming far beyond what I'd expect to see on TV, the acting (especially by Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black) is outstanding. For those who like action, the CGI was good (though thankfully limited) and it's really hard to beat the big shots provided by the Arctic and all that military hardware! It was also very nice to see bit parts played by real armed forces personnel, just as in the past. Being a fan of time travel and alternate universe themes myself, the plot was well-done and was quite a bit different than what they've done in the past. The only complaint I might have would be that there was no forward movement in the development of the main characters, something to be expected in AT/AU stories.

However, I did come away with a much better appreciation for Cam Mitchell, which is a big deal for me.  I also never cared for Vala up until now- but Vala/Qe'tesh was superb in this movie, thanks to Claudia Black. Though his part wasn't big, it was great seeing O'Neill again, especially Colonel O'Neill, and it looks like there's still something up with the General and Carter. In general, though, this is an action film and all of the  character interactions are necessarily brief. Another ten minutes of run time could have given us that great team banter back again, and there were flashes of that, but they were limited by (I presume) aiming for a two-hour TV time slot.

All in all, I'd say the movie was technically very nice, exciting to watch, had a few nice character moments, and carries the story arcs developed in SG-1 very well. Since Ark of Truth and Continuum were great caps to two of the main story arcs, I'm looking forward to new adventures in future movies and maybe find out what the heck O'Neill has been up to the last few years, because certainly it seems that the SG-1 saga is far from over.",1218931200,,1910,4.495677233429395

Although Stargate:Continuum was another take on someone messing with the timeline,(see the Stargate episode 'Moebius') this movie is fun to watch.  It was too short for my taste so I'm hoping there's another movie planned in the future.  We learn some background history about the Stargate when Baal goes back in time to alter the timeline so he can defeat the other Goa'uld system lords and later conquer Earth.  The movie does a nice job working in (although briefly) many of the characters from over the years.  O'Neill makes a brief appearance (yay) and Mitchell gets to be a hero.

There was no comparison in watching the Arctic scenes (so-so) vs Planet Earth Blu-Ray (great).  Not sure why they'd even release this as blu-ray unless they're pulling a fast one.

The story had holes in it bigger than the gate itself.  When time changed, people were disappearing like Back to the Future style. poof?  The paradoxes are ridiculous..  like why is Baal able to travel back and stop the stargate from arriving in the US.  if he did that, he wouldn't know about Earth in the first place.  where did Baal get Anubis's ship?  how did Daniel's leg reappear?  why make mitchell the hero?  you'd think for a $7mil budget, they'd pull a better script together.

If ""Continuum"" is the new standard of what we (the fans) can expect to see in the future from this franchise, then they should just stop making these films now.  The plot to ""Continuum"" is silly, the narrative (the story and how it is told) is completely bland and devoid of life.  It was as though all these characters we have come to know, suddenly had their souls written out of the script.",1218585600,4,594,4.584905660377358

Okay, I'll confess that I bought Continuum because I needed a Stargate SG-1 fix. Since my beloved series traveled through that final wormhole after 10 fantastic years, I miss them. I'd have bought this movie regardless of what reviews might have said because I wanted to hang with the team again. Therefore, I was thrilled when the movie wasn't just watchable but was a well-plotted story filled with great characters who make you believe they really are a go-to team capable of saving the earth from destruction.

Full of twists and turns, the production values of Continuum make you feel as if you're watching a big-screen theatrical release rather than a made for video spinoff of a television series.

I won't spoil the surprises, but they are many and they're well-thought out and make you easily suspend disbelief. Get it and prepare for a thrill ride that doesn't depend on your being a former fan.

If you're a Stargate fan, then you'll feel like you're seeing old friends and the movie is just too short for a good reunion at any length.  It's very well done, and it made me laugh and get a tear in my eye and also suprised me in places. Having lived in the COLD(Nome, not WAY THE HELL UP THERE), it was enjoyable to see the ""Making of"" featurettes, and I have to say it was as enjoyable as the movie. Being a Ben Browder fan, I loved the hair this time, Is it different?... or is it just me?  I had a hard time accepting him even with my LOVE of him after I watched the episodes to familiarize myself with the show when he came on because I fell in love with the O'Neil character.  In this movie and when I watch season 9-10 now, I'm HEARING his character and laughing because the writers gave him some funny ____to say, but I couldn't hear him for the comparisons I was making.  My Bad! What an impossible job to come in a replace the lead!  I especially loved seeing the characters settle into their new lives. Daniel Jackson calling himself was a touching scene. It was refreshing since it isn't always possible to 'relax' with a series time-frame. This might be a more feminine point of view...since some other reviewers might have enjoyed more action. I love action too, but often miss more 'personal' moments. I hope the fact that I had to got to 3 stores to find it(because they were sold out) is a huge incentive to make more Stargate movies.

There are twists and turns and surprises around every corner. One interesting note; the Arctic scenes are actually filmed in the Arctic and the submarine is the USS Alexandria, a nuclear sub with her crew.

Davis, and a great story.

I really liked how they played out the ""no Stargate program"" storyline.  If this was the last SG-1 movie (hopefully not), they definitely went out the right way.  I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie.",1218499200,,632,4.770642201834862

However, considering that it is the second Stargate 'feature film' this year, maybe I expected too much.  After all, the writers are pitching a fit about having to come up with 20 episodes a year for TV series these days.  The first few seasons of SG-1 contained at least 22 episodes each; and DS9 seasons typically contained 24 episodes or more!  It's a tough life writing Sci-Fi I guess.

I also agree that Continuum is certainly a better movie than The Ark of Truth.  Based upon both of these flicks, it looks like we're being treated to Stargate SG-1 Season 11 in roughly 1 1/2 hour episodes about every four months.

As much as I like Ben,bringing Jack and Don back to complete the whole team made the movie. Time travel always great to stimulate the mind. It was over to soon. The next movie should include deleted scenes and bloopers in the special features?And since the movie is only available on dvd why not make it longer giving each character more play?I have seen most of the original series but plan on buying the box set next so I can see them all again. I'd like to see a two part crossover movie between SG-1 and Atlantis at some point. Being former military and a closet geek Stargate helps fill a much needed adventure fix.

It was also great to see Richard Dean Anderson and hear the quirky ""O'Neill"" humor again, I have missed it.

The movie has some outstanding scenes in the Arctic not the least of which is a sub coming up through the ice. The ""grandfather paradox"" raises some questions that has led to spirited discussion at Gateworld and other other places. Excellent commentary and extras.

When Baal travels back to Earth's past, he ensures that the Stargate program doesn't happen. Samantha Carter, Daniel Jackson, and Cameron Mitchell arrive back on Earth in a different reality and must figure out how to correct the timeline before the Goa'uld invade Earth and destroy all hope.

Fans of the record-breaking Stargate SG-1 series are in for a treat. Many characters from the show's past make brief appearances, as well as the late (and sorely missed) Don Davis. But the highlight for me was the featuring of my favorite Stargate bad guy: Baal, played by Cliff Simon. Baal's character has a wonderful blend of sarcasm and condescension, which has led to some wonderful scenes with the SG-1 team. And of course, all of SG-1 is back, including Richard Dean Anderson as Jack O'Neill.

Unlike the previous movie, The Ark of Truth, this movie is a stand-alone. And with the incredible special effects, this would have been great to watch on the big screen. From filming in the below-freezing temperatures of the Arctic to back in Vancouver, the scenery and backdrops are exceptional. I also had high expectations regarding the storyline, since it included time travel, one of my favorite subgenres of science fiction. I wasn't disappointed.  Though there were some convenient loopholes, the plot was fun and exciting.

All the regulars are back and we couldn't have been happier.  It was a lot of fun (something you don't see too much of on TV anymore).
I won't give any spoilers (where would the fun in that be???), but we do get to see some old bad guys and even Vala as K'tesh(!).  This is a movie for fans of the series.
My family and I really enjoyed it and hope that many more will too.  As mentioned in a different review, this was Don S. Davis' last appearance as Hammond as Mr. Davis died of a heart attack in June.  Condolences to his family aside, this is a blow to the SG-1 family as well.  He was there in the beginning and lent a touch of realism to the series and the movie.  He will truly be missed.  I hope in the next movie, he will be honored in some way by the cast and writers.

This story brings back the Goa'uld in a big way, right when you think they're going to be forever eliminated as a threat to Earth.  Tons and tons of actors from SG-1's 10 seasons are enlisted, and the storyline is awesome.  Too many times, TV shows that make a movie spend too much time giving the production a ""movie"" feel.  Continuum feels like a lost episode of SG-1 - time travel conundrums, what-ifs, and plenty of action kept me on my toes from start to finish.

Another plus, my girlfriend, who has only ever seen the original movie (Stargate) and Ark of Truth, really truly enjoyed Continuum and wants to watch the series.

I watched anyway not expecting much and gladly I was not disappointed.

The movie was rushed and it was flat, it felt like they wanted to make a movie but had no idea what to do. my Wife who has been watching the series since the very fist episode, walked out 20 minutes before the ending, when I asked if she wanted to see the end she asked ""would it make a difference?"" and I have to agree with her.

besides the story being unremarkable and tired there are the usual array of nits. I won't get into all of them because I don't have enough minutes in my life to recount them all but the crux of it for me is: Bal changes time and SOMEHOW our heroes are unaffected so they go about trying to fix things. when I read that originally I figured it would be explained in the film, nope no such luck. apparently the writers decided that SG1 was unaffected and that was that, no explanation as to why the entire universe changes and only our heroes are spared. the movie just goes downhill from there.

I don't know why they bothered to make this film, it is obvious that they really didn't have an idea of what to do so they just ran film and ran with it.",1217980800,10,1404,4.113138686131387

It also flips out completely for a few frames here and there and displays a randomly colored pixelated image.

The movie itself is a good rompin' episode of the sci fi classic. But save your money and get the DVD.

UPDATE: I upgraded the firmware on my LG drive and it solved most of the issues with this disc. The lurching/stuttering/syncing problems are gone.

3409011,5,B0017MO10U,"Yeah, I am a huge Stargate fan.  The franchise created by Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright is the longest running sci-fi series in the US.  While longevity might not always indicate quality, Stargate lived 10 seasons on network TV because it presented long story arcs along with interesting characters and situations that you wanted to watch week after week.

So, with that, this second movie produced after SG-1 was not renewed as a series on the Sci-Fi channel-- ""Continuum"" was definitely a treat. While the prior movie tied up lots of loose ends, Continuum is really a continuation of the franchise.  The use of an alternate time line provided an opportunity to give familiar characters different roles than they have played in the past.

The story, without revealing any details is ""simple"".  Ba'al as a continuing bad guy has a fail safe to prevent his (un)predictable demise.  The Stargate time line is changed and the Stargate program is not developed as it had been on Earth.  It is up to SG-1 to set things right, stop the destruction of Earth and the Gou'ld take down of the galaxy.  For such a familiar story line you would think it would be getting OLD.  Guess not!

Highlights?  Jack O'Neill makes an appearance.  Vala is wonderfully different in character, as is Teal'c -- both characters revealing a potential past.  The concept of time travel --especially getting to see how it is accomplished-- is always fun, along with the paradoxes time travel always seems to present. Oh, and as one of my friends always used to say to spoil things I had not seen yet.... ""everyone dies"".

If you are a fan, Buy this movie.  You will enjoy it.  If you are not a fan, start with season 1 and work your way forward!  You only have 10 seasons of spectacular sci-fi to get through.

I just hope that this is not the last thing we will be seeing of Stargate SG-1.  A tear forms in my eye thinking that might be the case....",1217721600,,1924,4.602941176470588

Now, all of us fans know this story is derivative of MANY previous Stargate episodes involving Time Travel, however, it's the execution that makes it stand out.  Ark of Truth was a good conclusion to the TV storyline, but this actually FEELS like a movie.

The writing for the ""Continuum"" script was EXCELLENT - action-packed and an interesting, clever story line. I liked the bigger budget effects - direction and production were a notch above what TV has time/money to do (and, by the way, the ""Stargate SG1"" TV series is WORTH BUYING - really wondered what SciFi was thinking when they cancelled it). I wanted even more cast time in the ""Continuum"" storyline (there were places which could have used it, but the budget didn't permit, I've read).  I LOVED having snippets of all the characters old/new (so good together) - especially having ""Jack"" back. It would have been great to have Jack in much more of the movie. I always get laughs from the writing for Jack's witty sarcasm. I realized with great nostalgia, how much I MISSED the SG1 TV show (with these characters - so great to have them all together in ""Continuum"" - the regulars Samantha, Jackson, Teal'c, Vala - Jack's return, Landry, Hammond, Hays, etc.). I think Ba'al is a wonderful bad guy. I wish the $ people (MGM, I've read) would decide to do more SG1 movies this well done or even better with a bigger budget (maybe do 2 films at one time) - if they can fund scripts this clever and well-written AND with the full cast which includes Richard Dean Anderson.  Even though they'd have to film around everyone's schedules - leave no wo/man behind!

I just didn't believe the government would let them live on their own or utilize their knowledge until after Baal appeared.  Granted, I believed the part of the government setting on their butts, but with all of Carter's knowledge they would not have let her go off and live a solidary life.

I caught the twist in the beginning - that part was good and you saw the foreshadowing, and it made for a full circle of where Stargate began, but it wasn't enough to make this a ""Wow"".

Kudos to all the cast and writers.  It was a great program and it will be missed.  Sorry, not a fan of Atlantis.",1217635200,,976,4.181818181818182

This is classic SG-1, impossible odds, the team working together, and a satisfying conclusion.  This is a balanced story between the characters (although Vala gets short-changed again), and not the Cameron Mitchell love-fest AOT was.  The special effects were stellar, the score is phenomenal, although at times too loud to hear the characters lines.  If this is what future Stargate movies will be like, sign me up to pre-order right now.

Taking story elements and themes from pretty much every season of the show, Continuum chronicles the final chapter of the Goa'uld System Lords.

Sweeping, breath-taking cinematics shot on site in the Artic and compelling storyline aside, one thing that I was very pleased to see was the continued humanization of Claudia Blacks' character, Valla, as evident in one of the closing scenes of the film - hinting at the growth hinted at in the character during the Ark of Truth film.

The whole cast is fabulous in this one, and I'm particularly partial to time-travel SF anyway. Surely Ben Browder must be considered for more SG-1 related shows -- either in movies or in a new series.  He's great, and so is Claudia Black, in this one.  See it.

It plays like the shows I came to love and look forward to while the series was on the air and it has the added bonus of a larger budget which shows in the special effects and in the sets.

3409027,1,B0017MO10U,"I was let down by this movie, I've read the other reviews and I can understand how people are excited by seeing their favorite characters back again, but personally I think they are over-rating this film and not being critical enough.  Don't get me wrong, its ok but that's about it, it would have made a good two part episode but not a great movie.  The problem here is they are adding a little extra for effects or going on location and just selling episodes as movies at $16 to $20.  So what were my problems:

Length - this was too short for what they wanted to accomplish.  They could have added an hour to this and really added to the plot.  If I'm going to buy episodes of Stargate, I at least want to feel like I'm getting enough for my dollar.

Subplot - The subplots were stupid, Mitchell's grandfather just so happens to be the captain of the ship carrying the stargate in 1939.  Yeah that's believable, your audience isn't stupid and that subplot added nothing to the overall film, it was a complete distraction.  Oh, and of the entire Armed Forces to just happen to be at the North Pole training - It's Jack O'Neill, yeah ok again your audience is stupid and you're the smartest script writers in the world.  Give me a break.

From TV to Movie -  I sense a lot of the problems with this film, and potentially future films is going to be coming from an overly excited crew that are getting to do more making a movie than they did making a TV episode.  They seem to be more concerned with their locations and adding cursing to the script then they do about the quality of the plot and script writing as well as directing the acting.  The whole ""we filmed it in the artic"" means nothing, you get one scene of Sam and Mitchell walking across the tundra and some aerial shots, big deal nothing makes up for a good plot or at least spend more on the special effects.  This is even becoming a formula for the Stargate movies, let's pick a cool location, and then have one or two of the character just walk while we fly around filming them and we can add an orchestra piece and that's really going to impress the audience, or are we impressing ourselves while making the film.  The problem is they are impressing themselves not the audience, it just slows down the film for the audience and the film is already too short for that, spend the time with plot development not impressing yourself with the location.  They think if they can impress us with their cute stuff, but nothing, nothing can replace a well thought out script and thoughtful dialog.  **spoiler** There are two examples of this that drove me crazy, one was when Jack is killed by Baal, don't you think after 8 seasons of building up the Carter/Jack relationship she might start crying or freaking out and then when Daniel falls through the ice is frost-bitten and they have to leave him behind to die, don't you think that might call for an emotional moment or some great final words before you leave a beloved member of the team to his death.  No we only get Daniel saying, ""Bye,"" that's it...great script writing, well thought out.  This is why this movie needed to be longer, this why they shouldn't focus so much on location and cute curse words, so you could fully develop the plot and script.

Richard Dean Anderson - OK most of us thought he was going to be a major part of the story, hello, why wouldn't you make him a bigger part of the story; he was the bedrock of the series.  Instead we get a couple of unremarkable cameo appearances, with goofy dialog and no substance.  That was a let down, especially since you advertised him so heavily as being in the film.

Effects - I really was expecting more effects then what we got.  I thought there was going to be a great battle scene in space or cities getting blown up, but not really.  It was a big let down for a short movie without much action, just the film makers trying to impress us with location, or planes and subs, etc.  It wasn't great.

I'm getting ripped off - Bottom-line, I love SG-1, I've seen every episode, but I really want thee show back... I'm not going to keep running out to buy these extremely short films.  It's a marketing scheme.  I'm sure they are making a lot more selling these DVDs then producing the show.  I'm done buying the films.  They just aren't worth it.  Put the show back on the air or why don't the ""movie makers"" just make a sci-fi stargate mini-series at least you would have time to fully develop the plot.  Anything is better than making your fans buy these films, or make better planned out films.",1217462400,62,4576,4.395486935866983
3409028,5,B0017MO10U,"First off, this movie is an introduction to the Stargate franchise for me; I know the series appears to be coming to the end, I intend to purchase the series. There fore there are many questions to be answered for me.

The movie itself had me captivated from beginning to end and I feel regardless of whether anyone has seen the series, this particular movie is captivating and inviting to viewers ignorant of the original series. In my view the main characters Jackson, Mitchell, Carter and Anderson possess average acting skills. Ba'al & Tealc are excellent. The plot was well planned and being a time travel fan my interest was obviously heightened by the story line. For the most part the effects are very good. (With a few glitches here and there.)

3409030,5,B0017MO10U,"Continuum works a timeline/time-travel plot which is very similar to that of Moebius (from the eighth season on TV). All's well that ends well - or so it seems. Can we be sure that we are back in the ""correct"" timeline in each of these SG-1 stories? The fish situation in O'Neill's pond (comparing Moebius vs. Threads) was treated none too subtly, for one thing.

While we awaited its release, the hype surrounding Continuum seemed to imply that individuals were disappearing at Ba'al's ""execution"" as a result of a change in a timeline such that they were not meant to exist in it.  Hasn't that hokey plotline been done before, and would the Stargate writers really do that to us?  At any rate, look who vanishes first.  And check out that special ""knowing"" look on Ba'al's face at the second disappearance.  Clearly there is a plan afoot.

Isn't one timeline - however it may branch off from another - just as valid as any other timeline?  The ""alternate"" Landry most adamantly addresses this idea to the SG-1 team who had somehow jumped into his timeline and is trying to ""fix"" things.  Further viewings bring more thinking on the matter.  Stargate consistently does that, ya think?  I so love this series for that, and one could not ask for better actors to move it along.

The writers are always exercising their collective intelligence to the extreme, and they have given us a consistent series of episodes over the years - filled with character development, irreverance, team spirit and reasonably good science.  Let's have one more movie that takes its time in these matters and allows the characters to enjoy each other more. And enough with alternate timelines and time travel already. That's been done to death.  Let O'Neill SO kick some Tokra butt, and have him and Carter finally get it on in the ""official"" timeline and retire to an ascended state, or at least the state of Minnesota. ""Fly Away"" by Bread would make a perfect ending song.",1217462400,,1952,4.739644970414201

The interaction between characters was great as always and the plot was entertaining.  It was great seeing ""the gang"" all back together.  I hadn't realized how much I'd missed new episodes of SG-1 until I saw the first scene. In the end I was only slightly disappointed.  My biggest (and really only) complaint was that I wish it had been longer.  It felt like a long episode, not a ""movie""  I would have preferred it was more like 198 min long instead of only 98 min.  I also wish Jack had featured a bit more prominently in the story instead of Cam.  Don't get me wrong, I like Cam alot (Ben Browder is awesome) but Jack has always been my favorite.

3409033,4,B0017MO10U,"I'm probably what would be considered a hard-core fan: I own all 10 seasons of the show on DVD and even some of the Fandemonium books. I watch episodes daily. I also think the show should have ended with the episode Threads and am not a big fan of the story ark in seasons 9 & 10 (don't like the Ori).

I was really excited about this movie and had been waiting impatiently for the DVD to come out for the past couple of months. I finally got the DVD yesterday and watched it last night with my husband, who enjoys the show (but is definitely not a hard-core fan). I did try to tone down my enthusiasm before watching the movie as I knew I was likely to be disappointed.

I did not enjoy Ark of Truth that much since I don't like the Ori, but I have to say I was not disappointed with Continuum. There were a few bits and pieces that bothered me and I'll have to find out if the things they did jive with the SG universe as we know it, and I always get confused with alternate timelines. But the movie was definitely enjoyable. It had a different feel from just a 2-part episode. The camera angles were different, the Arctic scenes were pretty cool. I'll definitely watch it again.

RDA's role was pretty minimal. I thought he was a bit too out there in the first and last scenes, but I did enjoy the scene with him & the team in the sub. That seemed more like the Jack of the early SG1 seasons.

I found the music to be a little too ""there"" at times, especially at the beginning of the movie. Basically, I noticed the music and wondered whether we really needed it. Might just be me over-analyzing things though.

I haven't watched all of the extras yet, but the ""making of"" extra was pretty nice and long, a definite improvement over the barren DVDs of the early seasons.

A good episode, but nothing more.  It was better than the first SG-1 Series Movie - Stargate Ark of Truth.  Just about anything would have been better than that first movie.

And where was the romance with Jack and Samantha?  We've all waited light years for something long-term to FINALLY happen between these two before one of the actors dies in real life.

Will we have to wait until the actors are in their 80's or 90's to see a real relationship bloom with these star-crossed and formerly military-restricted sweethearts where they can get it on for the long term?

The possibilities for comedy and creativity are endless if the creators of these series/movies take this next giant step.

If you make another movie please let Carter have a life with her beloved Jack.  It is just getting to be so one-dimensional.  The possibility of adding the depth of a real relationship between these two would really add to the dimension of this series.

Please don't let SG-1 go down in history like the real people in Washington, DC.  They have no lives.  I just moved away from there.  I spent the last 52 years of my life there.  I was born there and was enmeshed in the politics and workaholism of the Washington, DC mindset.

When I wanted to stop being a workaholic I searched for a Workaholics Anonymous in the DC area and NO ONE HAS STARTED ONE.  GO FIGURE!!!!!

Please let the SG-1 Characters have more of a life than their real governmental counterparts in the Washington, DC based government and military.  It's about time!!!!  There is more to life than power and prestige.  Jack and Samantha need to get it on.

It was great to see Teal'C and Daniel and the other regulars.  I marvel at Christopher Judge's physique each time he is on screen.  He is a wonderful actor also.  Best wishes from me to all of the actors, crew, writers, etc.

I do have a technical observation of the first half of the movie.  It was shot too dark.  It was far too difficult to see what was going on for most of what was happening at first in the Antarctic.  If a new printing is made of this movie you might want to lighten it up a bit.

It was with sadness that I read of the recent passing of Don S. Davis.  I hope he is smiling down from up above as so many of us enjoy seeing him once more in this movie.  May God Bless him and his family as they mourn his passing.

Thank you to Richard Dean Anderson and the rest of the team.  My family and I have Seasons 1-10 and we enjoy watching them over and over again.  The SG-1 Series has so much depth and creativity packed into each episode that I am sure it is hard to top the episodes with a movie.  But I hope you take my advice and add that missing component - Jack and Samantha together - and we want to watch :)",1217376000,4,2920,4.3290203327171906
3409040,3,B0017MO10U,"Spoiler Free Review

The Good:
This movie is much better than The Ark of Truth. The special effects are first rate. It was nice to see the old characters. You see a little more grit ie. blood and bad language. Overall it was enough to get my ""Stargate Fix"".  But not enough to recommend a buy. Buy if you want to complete your Stargate dvd collection. Otherwise, rent it.

Ben Browder is finally hitting his stride. His performance was much better in this movie. I stopped thinking of him as John Crichton and thought of him as Cam Mitchell. Claudia Black and Beau Bridges were outstanding.

The Bad:
The story felt very rushed and like a long tv episode.  There could easily have been a Continuum 1 and 2 if the writers would stop and develop the characters a bit more.  I think most fans prefer quality over quantity.

As much as love Richard Dean Anderson, his performance wasn't that great.  He is self aware on camera and his timing is slightly off. You could tell he's simply out of practice. I wonder if they were just too afraid to tell him.

The Ugly:
The amount of Botox used was incredible! RDA and AT have the same flat faced mask look thru most of the show. The result is that RDA seems sad and AT seems bored. We all know the whole cast is older. Stargate has been on what 13-14 years?  Why do they have to stay young?",1217376000,9,1332,4.313253012048193

Like the lack of snow on their coats when they slide and exit the ship in the beginning; although the whole Arctic photography was outstanding.  Then there was the 1929 ship, which was sitting way too high in the water to be carrying the chapa eye, but then that would have made the storyline more difficult.  Then there was the..........well you get the point.  But, hey, that's what a small, Canadian budget gets you.  The acting was outstanding from everyone.  Most notably from Valla, Te'alc, and Mr. Bridges.  Samantha seemed not too interested and Col. O'Neil was eye candy for old timer fans, but they didn't make the film any weaker.

It was fantastic to see so many people brought back for this one.  The special effects were great, and the actors did a great job, too.

It wasn't perfect, however.

People vanishing from an altered timeline...  That just doesn't happen.  There are infinite possible universes out there, and when travelling through time, you create a new branch.  You don't destroy things in the parallel universes.  It's a fundamental part of the Stargate universe.

Ignoring that, however, the film is terrific.  If you need your SG-1 fix, with plenty of action, special effects, and cast members, this delivers.  Great job by everyone.

3409047,5,B0017MO10U,"Following on the release of The Ark of Truth, Continuum is the second Stargate SG-1 movie to come to DVD.  Unlike Ark of Truth, Continuum is not potentially weighed down by having to overtly tie up loose ends left by the series. While, in fact, it does tie up a few loose ends rather nicely it also does something else: it brings Stargate SG-1 full circle.

The plot is classic SG-1: the last of the system lords Ba'al (played by the ever villainous Cliff Simon) is about to be executed with SG-1 and Jack O'Neill in attendance. Suddenly people start disappearing and SG-1 members Daniel Jackson, Samantha Carter, and Cameron Mitchell flee through the Stargate to a world where the Stargate never made it to America just before World War II thanks to Ba'al meddling with history. After facing alternate versions of people they know and being dismissed, Earth comes under attack from Ba'al, his queen Qetesh (aka Vala) and his first prime Teal'c.  The team must find out how Ba'al changed history and put it right...or else. Writer Brad Wright brings together two of the series' best threads: time travel and the threat of Goa'uld invasion together to bring the series not only full circle but what could also be called SG-1's greatest hits.

One of Continuums biggest pluses is that it brings the original cast back together. Richard Dean Anderson appears once again as General Jack O'Neill and while he does not appear in the entire film, his presence his certainly welcome and makes for a great addition to the film. Also returning for this film is the SGC's original leader, General Hammond. The late Don S. Davis makes his final appearance as Hammond in the film's alternate timeline and while it's a shame that he doesn't know the team in those scenes, his appearance (like O'Neill's) is a welcome addition to the film.

The big thrill of Continuum is watching familiar characters in the alternate timeline. It is here more then anywhere else that the film brings the series full circle. We get to see the Goa'uld system lords back together again even SG-1's first nemesis Apophis in a surprise appearance. On top of the alternate versions of Teal'c, Vala, Hammond, and O'Neill we get to meet alternate versions of Hank Landry and President Henry Hayes.  Landry is played masterfully by Beau Bridges who is able to make the lines between the ""real"" and alternate Landry's almost indistinguishable. Hayes, played by William Devane and last seen in SG-1's seventh season finale Lost City, is much the same as the ""real"" version we've met before; skeptical at first and then forced to face the incredible with a brave face. Their appearances are what separates Continuum from Ark of Truth and marks an improvement.

The film also makes a fine blend of the cerebral and action sequences. While ostensibly an action story, Continuum also takes moments to explore, on the personal level, the effects of seeing a world and people you know be almost completely different.  Yet when the film needs action it has action from submarines rising in the Arctic, to dogfights and gun battles the film shows what SG-1 could be at its best: intelligent and yet action packed.

The stand-out aspects of Continuum are the amazing location photography, special effects, and music. The location filming in the Arctic (done in below zero temperatures) is amazing, beautiful, and breathtaking all at once. Considering this is a relatively low-budget film it's an incredible addition and it makes the film feel even bigger in scope and scale.  Scope and scale are the purpose behind another one of the film's highlights: the special effects. From dozens (if not hundreds) of Goa'uld ships to dogfights and extensions and additions to sets, the special effects in Continuum continue SG-1's proud tradition of bring feature film quality effects to the small screen.  Then there's Joel Goldsmiths' score which like Ark of Truth evokes the epic feel of the film.  Each of these make Continuum stand head over heals above many of the direct-to-DVD sci-fi films released all the time.

The special features should please any SG-1 fan. There are two excellent behind the scenes documentaries, one about the making of the film and one dedicated to the Arctic filming. The one on the Arctic filming is especially interesting for allowing one to see the challenges of filming in one of the most remote places on the planet. The big star of the special features is the commentary by director Martin Wood and writer Brad Wright. Their commentary reveal both the joy, hardships, and difficulties of bringing Continuum to the screen.

Continuum is not only an excellent addition to SG-1 but brings the series full circle. From classic elements to the return of favorite characters and villains to outstanding photography, effects, and music Continuum takes what could have been a boring attempt to tie up the loose ends of the series and creates a action packed adventure.  Continuum may well the end of SG-1 and if it is, Continuum is it going out on top.",1217376000,3,5023,4.886016451233843
3409048,4,B0017MO10U,"It felt more like an episode than a movie. That certainly isn't bad the fact it was another entertaining movie, but it is bad in the fact we have to wait so long between movies. This was another closer episode. Last time it was the Ori, this time the last system lord, Baal. The story centers on Baal's symbiote being removed but then they find out it is another clone and the real one has impacted the timeline so that he can invade Earth. Good acting, sets, music as you would expect from a well produced series. Fortunately there were plenty of episodes during the series that left themself open to return visits. They either need to make the movies more like movies or better yet bring back the series. They obviously don't mind making the movies and they have had a break from the series grind for awhile. Whatever their decision I'm just happy to get either. Being a fan since the very beginning when it first started on Showtime, I look forward to the further adventures of SG-1. Good quality DVD but I had to play mine on a multi-region player to get it to work. It would not play on a standard DVD player. Great replayability.

3409049,5,B0017MO10U,"This DVD was released on 29 July 2008.  So any reviews you read that are posted before this date are obviously bogus.  However I purchased the DVD myself with American Dollars, Greenbacks, Bucks.  And I thoroughly enjoyed it!  Man, just about everybody returned in this one.  Even that HOT System Lord Nirrti, albeit for a brief moment.  Apophis was there too, but all too briefly for my taste.  Jack O'neill was there also, AND there was talk of cake!  But again, all too briefly for him as well.  However it was a most excellent show and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  We can all thank God for this particular production of Stargate ""Continuum""!

3409050,5,B0017MO10U,"Just finished watching it.  It really was terrific.  Some reviews are right, it has similar time travel themes from some of the shows, but it is done in new places and in new ways.  Seeing the cast from the past was great as well.  Definitely worth it, you'll want to watch it again soon after the first!",1217289600,2,304,4.280701754385965
3409051,5,B0017MO10U,"First, let me preface this by saying I hardly, if ever, write reviews--especially for movies. And also that I am going to leave out any and all spoilers when it comes to the movie itself, with the exception of it's very general plot. For those of you who have, for some reason, not bought this movie yet.

When I first heard that this movie was going to involve time travel and an alternate reality, I was skeptical just like you. But I must say that the team really came through on this movie in waulity, writing, and even directing.

Martin Wood is not my favorite Stargate director, but he did a really good job on this movie.

Where this film shines through most is in the interaction and dialogue between the characters. This movie delves deeper into the characters of Samantha Carter and Daniel Jackson than any full season of the television show. Also, Jack's brief part in the movie was well done, and he was, of course, just as funny as always.

The real star of the movie, though, was Cameron Mitchell. Those of you who think that the show lost something with the departure of Jack O'Neill may find that surprising. But this film does something that two seasons and another movie were never able to do. It allows Mitchell to come out on his own as a character. He finally falls into place as an important central character and steps out of Jack's long, daunting shadow.

I won't say more than that because I don't want to ruin anything for the fans.

I'm obviously not very good at this, so I'm going to end this simply by saying that this is a very good Stargate movie and it is better than Ark of Truth, which was somewhat limited by the pure amount of plot points it had to cover to satisfy the fans. I was extremely happy with it. My only complaint now is that since it was an alternate reality story, it didn't sate my SG1 craving! I wanted to see the team together working a problem throughout the movie, like they were on a regular mission. I miss that, and episodes with the whole team working together were precious few during the final two seasons.

Someone tell me there will be another movie!

If you are a Stargate fan, this movie will make you happy. There are plenty of tasteful cameos--one in particular that knocked my socks off a little--and more than one reference to obscure Stargate trivial, but I watched it with a friend who knew nothing about Stargate and afterwards he made it a point to tell me how much he enjoyed it and he is now going to make it a point to watch the show.

So, is the movie good? Yes. It is. It really is great. Buy it, rent it, watch it. That's the only way we are going to get another one, I think.",1217289600,3,2656,4.349494949494949
3409052,5,B0017MO10U,"I really enjoyed the first DVD, STARGATE - THE ARK OF TRUTH, but felt it was lacking in two areas:  1. no Jack and 2. the ""movie"" was no more than a standard two- or three-part episode.  Well, in STARGATE - CONTINUUM, Jack is back, in not one, but TWO roles!  And the story itself is more than satisfying.  It is bigger and better than episode, has all the stops pulled out, and retains all of the great elements we have come to know, expect, and love from Stargate.

In STARGATE - CONTINUUM, we find our friends called back from their various exploits around various galaxies to witness the execution of the last of the Ba'al clones, thus the final destruction of the System Lords.  But, as always, Ba'al has a trick up his sleeve, and the twists, turns, and fun begin.  This movie is classic Stargate at its finest, with timelines changed, history rewritten, and our heroes needing to save the day and put everything right.

Richard Dean Anderson is perfect in his reprisal of Jack.  I really miss Jack when he isn't there.  Anderson's timing, ingenuousness, and droll repartee are archetypal Jack, and just what we wanted.  Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, and Christopher Judge are all together again as SG-1.  Cliff Simon out does himself as Ba'al.  There are special appearances by Beau Bridges, the beloved Don S. Davis, William Devane, and pretty much anyone who has played a character over the last 10 years.  It was wonderful to see them all together again, bringing the story full circle and putting a nice, neat, exciting bow on the entire package.

STARGATE - CONTINUUM is fast-paced, action-packed and tons of fun.  The special effects are terrific, and definitely a cut above a typical episode (which are pretty good to begin with).  The settings and scenery are beautiful to watch, and are mostly shot on location.  You will find yourself cheering for our heroes, and wondering how they are going to get out of this mess and save the world, as always.  But, as always, they do.  And we wouldn't have it any other way.",1217289600,72,2060,4.685236768802229

3409054,5,B0017MO10U,"If you have ever enjoyed a single movie or episode of Stargate you will love this. Like everything Stargate you need to at least be familiar with the basic premise of the TV show to grasp it. That said, even if you haven't seen an episode in close to 9 years you will understand it enough to know you are in for a treat. It is dramatic, funny, and most of all a fun ride. My only complaint is its length. The 98 minutes goes by all too fast. I'd have been happy with another 10minutes, and ecstatic with an extra 20 to fully soak in the characters and story. Make no mistake in what time there is has been used well, but a few climactic scenes could have been lengthened a bit to stress the true direness of the situation.

The BD transfer is overall very good especially many of the arctic scenes. There was no doubt on those it was all on location. There are a few shots interspersed that look as if came from a standard definition stock most notable a couple of the airplane shots. The rest of the footage is standard fare for a BD transfer. The arctic shots truly are what sets the BD above and beyond the DVD copy. I just wish there was a digital copy included is my only real gripe.",1217289600,8,1188,4.165217391304348
3409055,3,B0017MO10U,"In Stargate Continuum, several actors from the past ten seasons of the show make an appearance, including the much anticipates Richard Dean Anderson guest spot. The movie does several things to separate itself from the the long running TV show such as adding a bit of spice to the language(there is some cursing) and give us a little bit more blood when it comes to the violence. Other than that, it really isn't that different from any 2-part or 3-part story arc from the episodes in the seasons. So essentially, instead of watching a movie, you are really watching a 3-part series finale without the restrictions put on it by a cable network for ratings purposes, which is actually kinda nice. The problem however, is that this story has been done before. If you have seen the SG-1 season finale of season 8, then you have seen this movie already, just with different characters in some spots. My problem with this movie is that it really isn't a movie it's just another episode, although I love the series, so of course it is fun to watch our favorite characters do what the do. But after awhile you begin to realize, as I have, that MGM has actually done nothing new with any of the Stargate franchises for about the last 3 years. The writers seem to suffer from ""copy & paste"" syndrome, or sheer exhaustion and can't give us anything new. It is hard, as a die-hard fan to notice this until you take the time to look back and see how you have gotten where you are. The perfect example of this? Star Wars Episode I. The first time I saw it after waiting in line for 36hrs I thought it was the best and coolest movie ever made. My anticipation of its release however, clouded my judgment. When I saw it the 3rd time I realized I hated Jar Jar Binks. I haven't watched that movie for almost 4 years now. I am fearful of the same happening with the Stargate SG-1 movies and the most recent season of Atlantis as well. I love watching and re-watching the first 8 seasons of SG-1 and first 3 of Atlantis but with these movies I don't think I will. They are enjoyable, but they have lost their magic and the awe that I felt at the end of seasons 6 and 7 when I though that SG was the best show on TV-and it was. But when You have a budget ten times greater than you did for the season finale of season 7, why can't you do more on screen? Many fans who are awaiting that ever elusive ""epic space battle"" will be disappointed because, despite the millions they spent on this film, it's not there. Like the title says, great quality with the sets, acting and effects, but there is nothing new. I guess the actors are getting paid too much now for the extra flair, but that's why I keep coming back, and that's why I will still buy this film, because I still have hope that the writers can give me not only a new and fresh story line, but something more grand and majestic than I've ever seen in outer space. (And with lots of explosions!)
Final thoughts:
Mildly Disappointed, yet entertained.
Grade: C+(I really hate to give this grade b/c I love SG-1 sooo much, but lets be real, it's just really not that great. Someone from Gateworld commented that this was the best story line ever for SG-1, but that makes me wonder if they ever watched any of the other time travel episodes. It's really NOT that different, if even at all. Unfortunately disappointed)",1217116800,9,3350,4.387459807073955
3409056,4,B0017MO10U,"The only thing that bothered me is that this already happened before. A few times in different ways. Several twists in the story keep you interested though. Can't wait for the blu-ray to come out so I can go buy it. Production and acting made it very believable. Just for that, I'm gonna go watch it again right now!",1216857600,,316,4.372881355932203
3409057,5,B0017MO10U,"In my humble opinion, this movie welcomely outshines Ark of Truth.  And I hope that further SG movies are of this same caliber or better.  While the Ark of Truth was simply too pat a solution to the problem of the Ori, Continuum has a manageable plot that can be dealt with satisfactorily in a hour and a half.  Even considering this, the one downside to Continuum to me is that it felt edited down, that is, while watching I got the sense that they cut out footage/story development to maintain the pace of the plot or to meet some time limitations.  Personally, this irritates my movie tastes.  I like character development/plot development just as much as action.  And I felt that an additional 10-15 mins to the movie to amplify some plot issues or highlight some interesting scenes would have been optimal.

I hope this doesn't give too much away, but there are some good, novel action scenes.  Particularly, there is a jet plane dog fight at night emphasis night, which I think adds novelty and an aesthetic appeal that cliched day time dog fights don't have.  In general, production values were much better than the TV series.

Cliff Simon was excellent as Baal.  The Goa'auld haven't been this cool since Anubis.  This really comes out in the Baal, Katesh, Teal'c relationship triangle that was very well acted and takes some unexpected twists.  Kudos to Claudia Black and Christopher Judge who was great as always.  Incidentally, Cliff Simon was really ripped.  I think this physicality added something to the character.  It gave Baal a physical embodiment of his mental, youthful flexibility that has always contrasted him with the other more arrogant, stagnant System Lords.  I wouldn't mind further movies finagling Baal back into the stories.",1216166400,12,1755,4.875

This movie shows great potential, but ultimately it acts as only a closer, giving no real satisfaction to the watcher. Hardcore SG-1 fans will enjoy this movie, but if you're not a long time fan or only watch the show occasionally,  may as well give this one a miss.

3409060,4,B0017MO10U,"Several weeks ago, I was invited to a Special Viewing of Stargate SG-1 Continuum.  I was, obviously, very excited and shocked that I was chosen to see the movie before it came out...  Plus, with all the reviews stating that this would be a typical SG1 episode (With Rick), I couldn't wait!  (What can I say, I'm a HUGE RDA fan!)...
The beginning of the movie was perfect.  To see the ""Old Gang"" together, again, made the opening that much more enjoyable!  Plus, RDA was great with the character moments, and just him being himself!  Trust me when I tell you that you will not be disappointed in the beginning...!
After the beginning of the movie, it seems that the writers had to ""cheat"" to allow the main characters to keep their memory of the altered time-line!  The other problem with the movie is that it seemed to be rushed to a certain degree!
I will admit that is was extremely nice to see so many old faces, but the problem was that there wasn't enough time to spend ""quality"" time with all of them, and the fact of the matter is that the writers had to keep the story moving!!  I will admit that they did, thankfully, have a few more character moments between the cast than in SG-1's ""Ark Of Truth"", but it still wasn't enough in my opinion.
Please do not get the idea that this movie was bad...  In fact, I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys the Stargate show, but at the end of the movie, you will feel like something was missing, and you'll want more, but you'll have to wait for another Stargate movie to be made!!  (BTW, don't forget to look at Col. Mitchell's locker...  Something will have changed; can you see what it is?)  What was it Jack O'Neil said, ""Even us humans know time travel is nothing but trouble...!""
In any case, I would still recommend this movie to any Stargate SG-1 fan, but in my opinion, I believe that ""Ark of Truth"" was a better movie, though not by much!  However, I will be purchasing this movie, and hope you all do the same!  Besides, if we all purchase this movie, then MGM may make more SG1 movies!

It's the SG-1 ""old reliable"" with time travel and parallel worlds. The exploration of Bahl's character is interesting, but doesn't really focus on the interesting questions. The movie sets up scenarios that aren't resolved to satisfaction. It's the usual, ""hey, let's create an alternate reality where we can kill off everyone or make a good guy into a bad guy, because it'll all get changed back at the end!""

The worst thing about the movie is that Jack is getting fat.  I know, doesn't really have much to do with the movie per se, but it was depressing nonetheless.  You'll get to see a few old familiar faces, some of whom were killed off long ago, and the alternate timeline thing works really well.  The special effects are top-notch.
