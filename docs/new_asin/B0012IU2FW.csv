After watching this, i realized that the only way to share Sacred Harp singing with others would be to involve them in one of these all day sessions. I found a group in Greenville, SC, and am bringing some new students to a Sacred Harp sing.

Since she's a musician, I thought the video would be a collection of sacred music by harpists! That would have been pleasant, but instead, what I learned and heard was no less than enthralling. Made me want to find a sacred harp group in town and join. The history that is related by both young and elderly singers communicates the singers' genuine enjoyment of the musical style, and their love of God. Anyone who has ever sung in a glee club, choir, school chorus, quartet, or wedding, needs to get acquainted with this most original of American music.

3089573,5,B0012IU2FW,I first saw this documentary on PBS. Wonderful history and account of sacred harp singing. I would recommend this to any music historian or Christian who wants to reminisce.,1358208000,,173,5.0
3089574,5,B0012IU2FW,"I have always had a fascination with Sacred Harp singing, and though I've never experienced it myself in its traditional, most pure sense, have sung many of the hymns. At my old church job, was the oldest - and only colonial church built in Washington, D.C., we were visited as much a history buff's destination as a worship place for the parishoners.

As such, in addition to the rich Angelican literature we frequently performed music of the colonies and early America, and I was always happy when the Sacred Harp came out. A few years ago a friend in Georgia told me about a documentary that featured his Sacred Harp group, about the history of Sacred Harp/Shape Note singing, etc. but I never heard any more about it. Somehow I missed the original airing on PBS, but a few weeks ago stumbled across a site that mentioned this documentary ""Awake My Soul"" and I had to have it. What an amazing, thoughtful, fascinating and uplifting film this is.

Filmmakers Matt and Erica Hinton, devotees of this music, are aided by a wonderful assortment of Sacred Harp singers, young, old and in between, who are part of the tradition for myriad reasons. To hear this music, sung like this makes me realize how much we've lost as a culture by forcing this music away and out into the backwoods of our country. In the early 20th century one could find almost nothing about this music, and in the 1920's a German Professor at Vanderbilt University, musicologist George Pullen Jackson stumbled into it only to be amazed that this ""Lost Tonal Tribe"" still existed in the country. He wrote, ""The nation's earliest music had been preserved not by the universities and institutions, but by unschooled country folk.""

The worldwide cultural associations with this music are rather amazing. Anyone interested in true world music, and hearing this for the first time will hear remarkable similarities with a variety of music including medieval, middle eastern, Spanish, and influences of Byrd and the other great British composers of his day. A friend remarked ""It sounds like that 'Mysteries of the Bulgarian Voice' album you dig so much."" And it does, but it shares, I believe, the melting pot qualities of other early European music, French dance music, the sometimes otherworldly modal harmonies, the double dotted rhythms, parallel fifths, etc.

It's almost a little dangerous sounding, which is, I think, part of it's enticement. The singing is loud, violent and emotional. The singers arranged in a square, with the leader (a different leader every one or two songs) sing full voiced and strong with the motto ""If you can hear your neighbor, you're not singing loudly enough"" - strictly enforced! The harmonies are unusual and beautiful, and most of the singer's faces reflect their heartfelt association with the text and the tune. It's an amazing thing to watch and hear - but which may put some off, and frighten others. More than once does the brutal quality of the full, open-throated singing arise, with one young teenage singer stating how it's just about the opposite of what any voice teacher or choral conductor would instruct. Amen!

The Hinton's did their research on Sacred Harp singing and more than just a ""feel good"" piece, they delve into a little history of shape notes, going back to 11th Century Italy and the monk Guido of Arezzo's development of his hexachord system for musical notation. They speak of the movements earliest New England roots, fuguing tunes, composers, such as Billings who infused this tradition with such beautiful music and harmonization, and how efforts by the likes of Lowell Mason and the Better Music movement drove these traditions out of New England, and how it was bruised and battered, kept alive almost in secret society fashion in America's deep south. They also go briefly into the Singing Schools that popped up all over the country at the time, teaching people how to learn to read and sing this music.

This part of the film has some wonderful photographs, including some of the covers for the songbooks of the time, one particular one standout for me was the hymnal whose cover reads: Genuine Church Music Comprising A Variety of Metres All Harmonized for Three Voices Together with a Copious Elucidation of The Science of Vocal Music by Joseph Funk I want a copy!

The interviews are splendid, the reasons for participation vary, though most are religious, as are the bases of this music itself, but it's appeal is infectious regardless of one's religious (or anti-religious) leanings. (My friend who's been involved forever, is an atheist - ""But I can't keep away from these people. We all love each other"" he's told me). One of the most powerful statements comes from a gentleman who asserts how, in modern life, most people in can only experience art as an outsider: going to museums, concerts, etc., and never can know the perspective of being a participant in the creation of something.

The 2 disc ""special edition"" is worth getting - with well over 4 hours of extra features, including 2 hours of selections - some 60+ songs - videotaped live at Sacred Harp ""Singings"" in a variety of locations, while the directors were researching. Additionally, for those who fear they may not understand some of the deep south accents, the whole thing can be watched with subtitles. What a powerful, beautiful, film this is. There were moments, the music took hold of me and shook me to my very core.

Sacred Harp is not just some songs we sing, it's something we do, much like living, breathing and eating, we sing this music.

Sacred Harp singing is a transforming experience, and ""Awake My Soul"" does an incredible job of conveying what it is like to be part of it.  It is both educational and deeply emotional.  I asked Matt Hinton once at a screening at a national Sacred Harp Convention, ""What led you to make this documentary?""  He looked incredulous and said, ""Have you HEARD this music?""

3089583,2,B0012IU2FW,"Having thought that 'Awake My Soul' was to be a two-disc CD set of Sacred Harp singing, I was surprised to find that it was a DVD set that had to be viewed rather than heard.  The first DVD centered upon interviews of many individuals concerning how they became involved with Sacred Harp singing.  Of interest was the portion concerning the development and history, with brief samples of singing in church U.S. colonial times.
  The second DVD consisted of actual singing from several congregations in southeastern U.S.  While very enjoyable to listen to, after the first hour, I wondered if they would ever run out of songs.  The exposure was very informative, and I would no doubt feel comfortable in giving it a try, but I would have liked a little bit more introduction to the reading of the notes.",1273622400,3,802,4.692857142857143
3089584,5,B0012IU2FW,"I'm a transplanted Californian, and had never heard about this music until we moved to Tennessee in 2004, and were introduced by actually attending a singing down on Lookout Mountain.  We were hooked.

The documentary is wonderful!  We owe Matt and Erica a tremendous debt for making it.  But you will never know the power of the music, and of the community that keeps it alive, until you attend an annual singing.

Check out [...], click on Singings, and then click Annual Sacred Harp Singings -- Denson Book, and search through the monthly listings.  Or, on the main page, scroll down and check out what is happening in your own state.  Call the group nearest you and ask for more information about the Annual Convention -- then GO and be a part of it.

Singing Sacred Harp turned out to be the best musical experience of my life -- we go as often as we can, and although we've only been singing four years and have a lot to learn, the power of this communal praise to God in song can bring us to tears as well.",1233100800,2,1013,4.379679144385027

His love of the music comes through so clearly in this documentary.  It is worth watching, over and over.",1278028800,10,763,5.056
3324080,2,B0012IU2FW,"Having thought that 'Awake My Soul' was to be a two-disc CD set of Sacred Harp singing, I was surprised to find that it was a DVD set that had to be viewed rather than heard.  The first DVD centered upon interviews of many individuals concerning how they became involved with Sacred Harp singing.  Of interest was the portion concerning the development and history, with brief samples of singing in church U.S. colonial times.
  The second DVD consisted of actual singing from several congregations in southeastern U.S.  While very enjoyable to listen to, after the first hour, I wondered if they would ever run out of songs.  The exposure was very informative, and I would no doubt feel comfortable in giving it a try, but I would have liked a little bit more introduction to the reading of the notes.",1273622400,3,802,4.692857142857143
3324081,5,B0012IU2FW,"I'm a transplanted Californian, and had never heard about this music until we moved to Tennessee in 2004, and were introduced by actually attending a singing down on Lookout Mountain.  We were hooked.

The documentary is wonderful!  We owe Matt and Erica a tremendous debt for making it.  But you will never know the power of the music, and of the community that keeps it alive, until you attend an annual singing.

Check out [...], click on Singings, and then click Annual Sacred Harp Singings -- Denson Book, and search through the monthly listings.  Or, on the main page, scroll down and check out what is happening in your own state.  Call the group nearest you and ask for more information about the Annual Convention -- then GO and be a part of it.

Singing Sacred Harp turned out to be the best musical experience of my life -- we go as often as we can, and although we've only been singing four years and have a lot to learn, the power of this communal praise to God in song can bring us to tears as well.",1233100800,2,1013,4.379679144385027

8246029,5,B0012IU2FW,"I first purchased this 7 years ago and consequently a number of copies since to give as gifts. It is a wonderful documentary and does an impressive job telling the story of sacred Harp. It is no easy story to tell as it is such an unusual music form that the only way to really, truly get to know what it is all about is to experience it. And that is what it is intended for, group participation. Not a concert or musical show of any kind. Each singing event is a wonderful and unique public celebration that is wrapped up in beautiful tradition, sacred poetry, soul stirring melodies and harmonies, and the warmth of a welcoming community of adherents from all walks of life. This film gives a nice glimpse of the history and living traditions that are currently employed keeping this music alive and growing today.",1453161600,,816,4.52027027027027

It's completely wonderful -- if you love choral music, or don't know anything about shape note singing,
this is a must.  True human passion is an amazing thing.",1409702400,,243,4.651162790697675

8246034,5,B0012IU2FW,"I had never heard of this Sacred Harp before I saw some of it on YouTube. Then I saw clips of this documentary and decided to get it. What an amazing piece of hidden, lost or forgotten American music history. I even asked a music teacher and she was not familiar with it. Well worth watching!",1397001600,,292,4.232142857142857
8246035,5,B0012IU2FW,"Wonderful!  Am Scot-Irish, so this touched a sweet spot.  Had heard of Sacred Harp singing, but had not heard a whole lot of it.  What piqued the interest was the scene in ""Cold Mountain"", but that was a professionally-performed setting.  Some of the music is rough-edged, which adds to its value, since SH was sung by many who could not read music and made up with enthusiasm what they lacked in musical talent.",1390780800,,412,4.602739726027397
8246036,5,B0012IU2FW,"We loved this documentary!  Awake My Soul lived up to it's title.  We were a little concerned when looking that the DVD contents that we may not be getting the actual movie as it wasn't listed... Don't worry, it's there and well worth the money.  The second DVD is filled with a collection of wonderful singing.  We only wish that this disc had been a CD so that we could listen to it in the car when driving!  You simply can't watch these discs without singing along.  We couldn't wait to attend our first Sacred Harp singing after watching this!  Simply great.",1389312000,,562,4.450980392156863
