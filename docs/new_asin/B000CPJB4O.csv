8100145,3,B000CPJB4O,"It was an enjoyable dvd to watch. I liked it throughly. It`s really hard, tho. The dance like we do title is kind of a misnomer. To dance like they do you`ll need a personal trainer and them to both come to your house so one of them holds your hand and the other goes into the kitchen to whip you up a frozen margarita - because trust me, YOU GONNA NEED ONE.

The production is top-notch. The dancers themselves are personable and warm. Its really a great video to WATCH. YOU AINT GONNA DANCE LIKE THEM THO. I mean I find darrens dance grooves hard on my brain. This video, there was no coming back from. I mean they don't MEAN to but, lord have mercy, you try to attemp this, you gonna see just how BAD a dancer you are! This is one step away from broadway. Maybe make that half a step.

Now I know if i read this review i just wrote i would now have to buy it just to see, out of spite. But in all honesty this is not a laypersons dvd learn to dance. If you are a professional dancer, then this is the one for you. If you're like me and you want to dance like this but probably never will, then buy it to watch and go wow - because, baby, thats probably all you ever gonna do.

Good luck in the future, guys! You are every inch the amazing, natural talented wonders on the dance floor. And very charming at that.",1223424000,3,1314,4.00763358778626
