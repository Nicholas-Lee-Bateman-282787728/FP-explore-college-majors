8483743,3,B005QUDIIU,"Genuinely odd 1941 film about twin brothers, one hopelessly insane and the other, well, rather bland and under the impression that his twin died when age 11 since he was sent away to school and his family faked the death of the crazy sibling and locked him away in a hidden room in the family home.  The sane brother finds out that his brother is still alive shortly after he attends his father's funeral--but by the time he and the doctor who forged the death certificate and was helping with the deception get to the family home they find the servant dead and the insane brother escaped.

One strange thing about Among the Living is that the insane brother, while undeniably dangerous, is also far and away the most likable character in the film.  He had been locked away in a small room for nearly his entire life so being out in the real world he is like a child, innocent and experiencing the pleasures and complications of being an adult for the very first time.

He's also liable to commit murder--but not out of malice or evil, but because his head isn't right as a result of abuse he received while trying to protect his mom from his brutal father.  The insane Paul Raden comes across like a cross between James Stewart's Harvey and Frankenstein, the latter connection made stronger when a reward whips up ""the villagers"" into a frenzy to find the killer.

Among the Living never quite gets its odd tone right--it frequently feels more like a strange comedy than a thriller.  Despite the set-up, the good brother has very little screen time so this never works as a good twin/evil twin film.  Much of the plotting doesn't even make sense--the good brother keeps letting the town doctor talk him out of calling the police even though he knows his twin is a murderer, making himself an accomplice for no good reason.  He also does virtually nothing to try and find his dangerous brother, even after being visited by him.

Predictably, since they are twins the good brother eventually becomes mistaken for the murderer.  Unpredictably he becomes the victim of an angry mob kangaroo court that was set up impromptu to make his lynching legal.

What the point of Among the Living is I really couldn't say.  It makes little effort to work as a thriller, has more effective comedic and melodramatic elements that are barely developed, then throws in some social commentary about mob justice that seems to come from a completely different film.  Where Among the Living works is in its sweeter moments of the insane, sheltered brother experiencing life for the first time--but, strangely, that doesn't seem to be the film anyone was actually trying to make.

Among the Living is mercifully short and the twin performances by Albert Dekker as the brothers is halfway effective--plus you get an early look at Susan Hayward who plays a pretty but not very nice girl who takes advantage of the insane brother after he takes a liking to her.  If you have a fondness for 1940's B movies this is pretty daffy and not very effective but it is interesting.",1460592000,,3047,4.677902621722846
8483744,1,B005QUDIIU,Very bad DVD-R copy.  Never specified in description.  Some of the film was so dark that you couldn't make out what was going on.,1385510400,2,129,4.333333333333333
8483745,4,B005QUDIIU,"albert dekker does an admirable performance in this early noir about the dual personalities of two twin brothers.  ,Age has withered and distorted the fine cinematography which enhances the dark tones of this film.  AMONG THE LIVING even with the short comings of what Age has done to the quaility of the film is still a well done production.",1353196800,3,342,4.779661016949152
