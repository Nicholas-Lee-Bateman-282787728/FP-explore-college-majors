5878327,1,B00DYA7Y8Y,"Cast, Need More Schooling In Acting. Or There Not Actors At All - Very Sad/Bad - The Movie Not Good At All - Not Worth The Price I Paid $1.99, It Should be Free. Don't Waste You Money.",1384300800,3,184,3.8684210526315788
5878328,4,B00DYA7Y8Y,"Goyo is a 17 year old gay teen, very close to his twin sister Rosa.  They live  in the Coachella Valley of California, where their parents work as migrant farm workers in the grape fields.  His father, Ramon, does not accept his son's sexual orientation, and is verbally and physically abusive to him and his mother, whom he somewhat blames for it. The problem worsens after Goyo had a tryst with a new young man in the camp, who Rosa later becomes interested in an starts dating.  Ramon throws Goyo out of the house for trying to seduce his sister's fianc.

This is an emotional, well-acted 2010 coming-of-age film, written by a screenwriter who based it on his own family.  I felt the characters of the sister and the mother were rather one-dimensional, and would have liked to see more development there.  Overall, however, this is a touching story that illustrates how society's preconceptions can hurt a young man such as Goyo.

This film is bilingual, since the older generation talks in Spanish while the younger ones speak English.  You can choose English or Spanish sub-titles on the DVD.  There are no other extras.  I give the film 4 stars out of 5.",1380585600,17,1160,4.665024630541872
5878329,4,B00DYA7Y8Y,"I truly enjoyed the plot! although this is the story of a young boy coming out of the closet and trying to figure out who is accepting of him. the actors portraying this film gave me a glimpse of how in the Latino culture, the father is abusive with the uneducated mother that has only love for her kids yet she is very weak, towards the end she finds strength and is able to stoop up on her own. The sister? well she has so much love for the brother but jealousy is dangerous....Dad? such a jerk yet, well acted for being a small budget film.",1448928000,,543,4.132075471698113

5878333,3,B00DYA7Y8Y,The story is worthwhile and an important one to tell. Poor acting and production values distract from the message but this is certainly a noble effort.,1424390400,,151,4.846153846153846
5878334,2,B00DYA7Y8Y,"The story line had good intentions.  Like most movies that portray a gay role, they focus on situations that are somewhat taboo and that happen more than we think.  Like this affair.  The cast could've used better direction from the writers and directors.  Trying to fit too much stereotype (the race and sexual preference) makes it feel a little to obvious in some scenes.  This film couldn't done better as a short story film in a series of narrative scripts invoking the different scenario a gay Mexican American can and has faces through their life.  It would help the audience capture the individual and not the poor quality of the film.  All in all, the story line was good but the acting, scenes, plots, were not well scripted or captured through the lens.  This could've done very well with the right direction:-)  Even as a low budget film...",1421107200,,851,4.695945945945946

5878336,5,B00DYA7Y8Y,I really enjoyed this movie. It was touching and reflects a family's coming to terms with a child's sexuality. I would recommend this to all my friends.,1419811200,,152,4.666666666666667

5878338,2,B00DYA7Y8Y,"The story had potential, yet the acting destroyed it. The best character was the neighbour Rosa.
I like indie movies, low budget films, but this movie simply couldn't hide the terrible acting.",1416441600,,192,5.03125
5878339,3,B00DYA7Y8Y,"Waterberry Tears tells an important coming out story centered in the Mexican American farm worker community of Southern California.  What the film lacks in production value, it makes up for in sincerity and heart.",1416355200,,213,5.264705882352941
5878340,3,B00DYA7Y8Y,ok but not the best acting,1415923200,,26,3.5
5878341,5,B00DYA7Y8Y,"I enjoyed it. The movie shows a different side, not often discussed by Hispanic families. It discusses a mixture of issues including immigration, machismo, conservative cultures, tradition, alcohol abuse, gender roles, physical and emotional abuse and obviously acceptance. For being a very low budget film, it introduced a good amount of characters and acceptable performances. Good job overall!",1413158400,,396,5.844827586206897

5878344,5,B00DYA7Y8Y,I really liked this spanish english movie. Not many are shown in spanish so it was a nice pallet for viewing. Was surprised with the ending and truly liked it a lot.,1405123200,,165,4.1875
5878345,3,B00DYA7Y8Y,The movie was OK. Dialog and filming were OK. So I gave the movie an OK.,1404950400,,72,3.5625
5878346,4,B00DYA7Y8Y,"All believable except possibly the ending.  So much going on and a wrap up that could have happened but in reality, much more conversation and anger would have been exerted exceeding the given movie time.",1394496000,,204,4.828571428571428
5878347,4,B00DYA7Y8Y,Good story about being Hispanic and gay.  One immediately feels for the boy and dislikes the father intensely.  Its unbelievable that the father turns around so fast at the end.,1394409600,,177,4.866666666666666
5878348,5,B00DYA7Y8Y,"This movie was a great drama of one gay  boy's life.  I liked the way they interjected the suggestion that he was raped as a young boy, not to suggest that was the reason he was gay, but to give meaning to the acting out place he would go to.",1394064000,2,242,3.82
5878349,1,B00DYA7Y8Y,This was so unsatisfying  that I started to skip through it.  The boy's acting wasn't too bad.  The others' acting wasn't too good.,1392681600,,131,4.608695652173913
5878350,4,B00DYA7Y8Y,I could relate to it. Well done. believable.and it kept my interest until the end. The acting could have been somewhat better.,1392163200,,126,4.7727272727272725
5878351,2,B00DYA7Y8Y,"This little filme is not really bad, but it is so predictble and lacking in nuance: the poor gay boy oppressed by the hard line father, the weak mother, the sister that steals his brother boyfriend, the macho and bad bissexual etc. all clichs, with an unbelievable happy end. It could even be a TV show in a gay country (imagine it!) and it smells of propaganda.. The cause is good but the film is weak.",1392076800,,403,4.315789473684211
5878352,4,B00DYA7Y8Y,"While I was happy to see a somewhat real portrayal of what some friends have had to contend with as out, gay Hispanic males living in the inland empire (southern California), I'm still saddened that some aspects of the culture don't allow for acknowledgement of gay men as part of the culture.  Films such as this one can hopefully shift some perspectives...",1391817600,5,358,4.774193548387097
5878353,1,B00DYA7Y8Y,"For a flim that says it was done in 2013 it was very poor  acting, filming, etc.  The story plot was not bad.",1390435200,2,109,3.6956521739130435
5878354,5,B00DYA7Y8Y,Great coming out and coming of age story for both the boy and the father. Well done b rated movie,1389830400,2,97,3.9
5878355,5,B00DYA7Y8Y,"You have characters here who are dis-functioned, and yet, they manage to grow and come together  This is much more than a gay movie.  There is an evolution to the the characters and story nicely weaved together.  I recommend it.",1389484800,7,228,4.65
5878356,3,B00DYA7Y8Y,Love & acceptance wins in the end--Yeah!  This suspenseful drama touches your emotions and you feel the pain of being different.,1389484800,3,128,5.095238095238095
5878357,4,B00DYA7Y8Y,The story was great but the production was such that I was unable to fully enter the story. I always felt like I was watching a movie.,1389225600,,134,4.0
5878358,2,B00DYA7Y8Y,"There are too few things to interest people in this movie. The whole gay teen versus the machismo attitude of the father story line has potential. However, the bad acting made it painful to watch especially the over acting by the actress portraying the mother.",1388966400,,260,4.8

5878361,5,B00DYA7Y8Y,"it was a little strange at first, but I watched the entire movie and the ending was really good. I have gay friends that are Latino and they have faced alienation from their families. I was pleased at the ending of this film!!!!",1388448000,4,228,4.325581395348837
5878362,4,B00DYA7Y8Y,"Though this low-budege indy is uneven in many respects, there were MOSTLY good acting performances. The metaphor of waterberry tears (no body want them) and the protagonist's life (he erroneously thought no body wanted him)  was moving.",1387670400,6,236,5.378378378378378

5878365,5,B00DYA7Y8Y,Good story about a young Mexican kid who is gay and unaccepted by his Dad and the pains he goes through  just to be who he is .The ending is sweet and the kids brother in law is HOT !... very loveable characters  and the acting is good ..... buy it or rent it  cause it is money well spent and enjoy it !,1385769600,7,304,3.71875
5878366,2,B00DYA7Y8Y,"Within 5 minutes of renting Waterberry Tears, I was wishing I could cancel the online rental and choose something else. I finally just accepted that I was going to watch a full-length student film. Ultimately, it was an admirable effort. The actors did surprisingly well (once I was able to get past the poor film quality.) The writing was ok. I don't regret watching it because I study gay cinema and it's valuable for that reason. I do regret paying to watch it. I was sick with the flu and this took too much effort to enjoy (getting past all the flaws.) I wanted something comforting...more palatable, more quality. I wish amazon would let you cancel in the first 10 minutes. I could've rented something more enjoyable. I won't watch it again.",1385424000,,747,4.666666666666667
5878367,2,B00DYA7Y8Y,"This movie is just so terribly sad - I'm sure it's an accurate portrayal of life as a gay youth in Mexico, but it's the same old thing. The same macho malarkey, the same supposedly straight-man on the down-low, using and abusing everyone. Whether it's Mexicans, blacks or midwestern Christians, the result is always the same. It made me want to beat up on both the rapist and the father, and I hate that feeling.",1385424000,2,412,4.506666666666667
5878368,3,B00DYA7Y8Y,"This is a compelling, well-paced story that held my interest to the end.  That is not to say that the acting and filming aren't a bit amateurish, but through it all they won me over.  The story has a number of twists and turns but, all in all, it seemed as quirky as real life can be.  For an Anglo like me, it also gave me a glimpse into the lower-class farm labor life of Mexican immigrants.",1385251200,8,393,4.077922077922078
8599041,5,B00DYA7Y8Y,"What a great movie. I watched in Prime and ordered the DVD for myself right away to put on my top shelf collection. Story about Mexican American family of grape pickers in suburbs of Palm Springs with gay son. Supposed to be about him but family and surrounding characters are so strong and such good actors he becomes just a part of the story. Good film quality, subtitles when needed, and good quality sound if you can stand Mexican music (lol). Sexual themes, but nothing graphic.",1528848000,,483,4.627906976744186

8599044,3,B00DYA7Y8Y,"A gay Mexican-American teenager's emerging sexuality comes into conflict with his machismo father, and a closeted suitor of his sister, played against a backdrop of California's immigrant Hispanic farm community. The performances are credible, if not a bit melodramatic; and the use of video over film, gives the story a more immediate treatment.
Young actor, Raul Rodriguez, has a flare for the camera, and delivers a heartfelt performance.",1468627200,2,441,5.5
