7215828,1,B00YI7U7O0,This show is freaking awful!!!!!! It is not funny and not smart and well made. The humor is nothing but fart jokes and it is stupid as heck. The show is about a kid and a pet snake who live everyday lives. WOW the creators should take lessons from Disney's Teacher's Pet Teacher's Pet is the polar opposite from this trash. The humor is very funny and I laugh every time I see that show. Teachers pet is for the whole family instead of school drop outs with no good sense of humor which is Sanjay and Craig. Another thing about Sanjay and Craig are that the characters are annoying. They are not like-able at all but make you want to punch them in the face. A lot of the episodes are plain disturbing like the one where Sanjay gets pregnant to his fart. I am not kidding. WTH!!! Why is this on nickelodeon??? Back to Teacher's Pet. The show is very creative and have funny episodes instead of scaring ones. The characters are lovable especially Spot Helperman aka Scott Leadready. What show #2 Teacher's Pet and not loser and dweeb.,1442275200,,1032,4.408376963350785

7215855,3,B00YI7U7O0,"Unlike Breadwinners which is pure unadulterated Garbage, Sanjay & Craig is actually the kind of Junkfood you can enjoy watching.  While having some visual simmilarities with Bob's Burgers the show is much more manic and crude in its humor.  And while it may be random & low brow it still manages to have its own odd charm.

 And hey at least its not breadwinners!",1474934400,,363,4.625

If it wasn't for the fact my child loves to watch it and I cannot find this anywhere else, it would definitely be returned. Plus the refund would probably take as long as the delivery. I would never recommend this.",1455753600,,284,4.0

8718341,5,B00YI7U7O0,"I am a very conservative mom, I didn't let my oldest kids watch rugrats when they were little because Angelica was naughty.  I have since changed my mind, lol.  I never let my kids watch fairly odd parents because the kids were so disrespectful to the parents and the cartoon made the parents out to be so stupid and I was not and will not let my kids watch shows that make parents out to be worthless pushover dummies.  Now at first I really didn't like this show, but I have 4 sons and 4 daughters.  My boys are great respectful boys, treat women very well with great respect, don't take things that they haven't earned, etc!  But when they watch this show, they laugh and laugh and laugh.  There is nothing I enjoy more than watching my kids laugh, even at 28, 23,  19 and 11!  This show is gross!  It really is gross, but it's what boys do!  lol  It was good insight for this mom!  lol  I will buy them all if they put them all on DVD.",1511481600,,939,4.121546961325967
