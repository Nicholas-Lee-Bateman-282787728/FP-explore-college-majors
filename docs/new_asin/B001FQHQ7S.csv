Always thought Willie Nelson handsome, but would love to see his profile carved into eternity @ Mt. Rushmore, along with a few other American icons.
Love the historic tour of famous NYC jazz clubs as backdrop too.",1283126400,2,419,4.441558441558442
3588202,5,B001FQHQ7S,"Very enjoyable DVD.  My wife is a little bit country and I am a jazz fan.  We both loved it.  Sounds like an odd couple, but it comes off great!",1268352000,3,144,3.7333333333333334

3588204,5,B001FQHQ7S,"I'm a long time fan of both Willie and Wynton and I can tell you that this intimate and spectacular concert is played at a much higher artistic level than I have ever seen or expected from both.

Wynton does not try to upstage but to complement Willie like a true second line musician. He uses a wide variety of mutes, colors and even singing and humble, involved and charming commentary to make his points.

Willie's guitar playing is amazing. He takes his usual Django Reinhart-inspired acoustic guitar style to reach deep into his soul to draw a high-level jazz performance out of his heart He swings like never before.

Sharing the front-line with Willie and Wynton is the surprising leadership of Mickey Rafael, Willies harmonica players. Insteadof choosing to use a Little Walter ""Mississippi saxophone"" style or a straight harp country harp style, Rafael draws deep in his sould to pull out a Sonny Boy Williamson II style ""St. Louis"" trumpet sound which like Clark Terry and Miles Davis emphasized economy of notes and maximizes sound colors and feeling. His performance is so striking that the documentarian has to insert a short discussion of Mickey Rafaelto answer ""Who was that guy on harp?"" questons.

I spent two hours a couple of years in Wynton's NY condo sipping on a glass of Armanac as we discussed Sonny Boy Williamson II's story and the institutionalized racism of the Mississippi delta. He called his children and ex-wife, listened to a couple of students who stopped by, and taught a few more some advice on the phone all the timewriting a book and some music with his trademark trumpet on the table. He's the real deal and exactly like the Wynton you see in the documentary.

Enjoy.",1249430400,9,1706,4.789115646258503
3588205,5,B001FQHQ7S,"What can I say, except wish I had been there.  Willie Nelson is a national treasure and I'm really starting to fall in love with Wynton - smile.",1242864000,5,144,4.142857142857143
3588206,5,B001FQHQ7S,"Smooth, exceptional performance.  Exceptional quality as you would expect from Lincoln center.  Commentary by Wynton and Willie add important dimension that make the music even better.  High quality jazz and blues for both the refined jazz listener and the casual listener.

3588207,5,B001FQHQ7S,Willie again finds a way to blend his unique country style with that of a renown artist of a different genre. Awesome jazz with an interesting twist!,1231632000,3,149,4.555555555555555
3588208,4,B001FQHQ7S,"Both jazz fans and country fans will love the recent collaboration between trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and country music icon Willie Nelson. When their two performances at Jazz From Lincoln Center in January 2007 were recorded and released by Blue Note this summer, the album jumped to the top of the jazz, pop and country charts. Thanks to Eagle Eye Media, the ""match made in heaven"" is available to see, as well as to hear, on Willie and Wynton"" Live From Lincoln Center. The 85-minute film (not video) contains extended solos and, on hot numbers like Louis Jordan's ""Caldonia"", Nelson plays his acoustic guitar as though he was always playing jazz. The camera moves very quickly and rarely spends more than five seconds on an image, which is the only defect I could find. This is an historic moment and the performances of old pop and jazz standards create a DVD  I'll certainly watch again.

3588212,5,B001FQHQ7S,"This is one of my very favorite DVDs. I love Willie, and this is my favorite recording of his, from all of the videos and albums of his I've seen and heard. This is very much a best of both worlds deal for me, because I love jazz as well.

Wynton and his band are amazing. Willie said it all when he said, ""What a band."" I love the set list. I also never tire of hearing the between song interview clips, because of the obvious mutual feelings of love and respect that shine through in them.

Watching this video is a wonderful way to relax for an hour or so and watch one of my favorite singers and guitarists sitting in with some of the best jazz musicians on the planet. And one thing that is very nice and very uncommon about this DVD is that I never hit the fast forward button.",1390608000,,783,4.077922077922078

You do not have to be a jazz lover to be able to appreciate Wynton's fantastic group, any more that you would have to be a country western fan to enjoy Willie's laid-back singing.
