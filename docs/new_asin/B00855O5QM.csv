5132165,4,B00855O5QM,"Bought this DVD on Cyber Monday and got it 2 days later per my Amazon Prime Membership. Loved it! This DVD is easy to follow and learn. Although it seemed a little stiff with the explanations, that went away the longer the DVD went on. The guy mostly explained the steps and different moves but since i'm a female, i wanted the woman to maybe elaborate a little more on each move. Other than that, the product overall is exactly what i was looking for!",1354320000,3,452,4.329411764705882
5132166,5,B00855O5QM,"Girl here, I've always been a ""dance by myself"" kind of person, but with a friend's wedding coming up, I decided it was time to learn at least a few basics of dancing with a partner so that my partner and I could present a united front on the dance floor. I've gotten a couple other dance DVDs from the same people (""Sexy Moves for the Club"" and ""Girls Night Out"") which I loved, so I figured I'd give this one a shot.

This DVD doesn't disappoint. As always, they explain the dance moves well and make it easy for anyone to pick up, though you will probably have to watch the DVD a few times to remember everything. We didn't love ALL the moves, but we did enjoy most of them.

They also have a complete choreographed dance that you and partner can do together for most songs, so the two of you can look like you really have it together.

Overall, I'm really glad I got this DVD. I'm feeling totally ready for the wedding, and learning this together with my guy was really fun. It's also inspired us to dance together more often since we now have a series of go-to moves.",1354233600,13,1072,4.219512195121951
5132167,4,B00855O5QM,buy this DVD.  Easy to follow.  Easy to learn.  Dance that you can actually use in a club and feel great.,1354233600,,105,3.9047619047619047

5132169,5,B00855O5QM,"A great DVD!  Not only instructional but filled with great music, graphics and production value.  I do wish there was an advanced level DVD but this is great for teaching the basics.",1344124800,2,182,4.65625
5132170,5,B00855O5QM,"This video was amazing! My fiance bought these DVDs to get the basics down before we took private lessons for our wedding.

I will admit I was a little skeptical, But after completing this DVD we were able to take our private lessons and start on a higher level (when we told our instructor about our prep for private lessons, he told us not to tell anyone about this DVD as he will be out of business ;) In short we were able to skip the beginner level lessons and saved hundreds of dollars on lessons!

The DVD itself is great, the moves are broken down and easy to follow! I would definitely recommend this to anyone, if you are getting ready for a wedding or just want to dance socially with a partner, this DVD will work wonders! Good luck",1343865600,5,744,4.2695035460992905
5132171,5,B00855O5QM,"I loved this DVD.  Everything from the cover to the menu just begged me to dive right in and the whole thing is shot in a beautiful set that makes learning fun!  The instruction was so clear and fun.  They spent just the right amount of time with each dance lesson. There are two instructors that give different tips for men and women, which is great if you are doing this with a partner. The music was great, and changed from latin to pop to dance and it even had some oldies.  I just wish I could get my hands on the music in the video because I can't seem to find it anywhere.  In my opinion, this is the perfect crash course purchase for someone who is looking to learn to dance fast.  The lessons range from latin moves, to slow dancing, to formal dancing, to casual dancing, and it teaches you ways to spice up dancing with your partner without learning any formal ballroom dances. I bought this DVD for a wedding, but I can use these moves anywhere now.  I'm just so impressed with this DVD!",1343088000,3,998,4.248677248677248
5132172,5,B00855O5QM,"This video was fantastic! Easy direction, great music and definitely something I plan on trying out!!
I have been looking around for something like this for a while, and I am glad I was finally able to find the best video out there.",1341187200,,232,4.4186046511627906
5132173,4,B00855O5QM,"I bought this DVD after a friend suggested it to me! The dance moves were broken down in a way that I could actually follow along, unlike a lot of other DVDs! Highly recommended!",1341014400,2,178,4.264705882352941
5132174,5,B00855O5QM,"I am so happy we found this! It was so fun, like a private lesson just for the two of us. My boyfriend, who has two left feet, was able to pick things up easily and then we added our own style to personalize some of the moves. We can't wait to show off and have recommended this to all of our friends. Although we started with skepticism, going through the series turned our lesson into a serious date night. I have another DVD from this series (""Sexy Moves in the Club"") that's also really fun to do alone or with my girlfriends as a brush-up before we hit the town in our stilletos. After I ordered my DVD, I got a personal email from the company who distributes this DVD thanking me for my business and confirming my order. That was was really nice touch.",1341014400,3,758,4.198630136986301
5132175,4,B00855O5QM,"I was sent this DVD to review. I found the menu a little tricky to work as I was playing it from my laptop and found it a little hard to click on the play button to get it to play at first. I wasn't too sure what to expect I was mainly interested in the partner dancing and was the reason I requested to review this DVD. I would say this DVD is heavily latin/salsa based and would be ideal for those people who are looking into this type of dancing. I am not certain when I will get to use these moves as I mainly listen to R&b and found most these moves not suitable for this type of music.
I had to rewind a fair few times the more tricky moves but there were some moves which I got after a couple of watches which was great! The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. The music was OK and was not distracting. The moves are performed by the same cast (one female and one male) which made it easy to follow as it was the same people throughout so was not distracting. The bar setting was really nice. Lighting was good and colours. So it did not distract you from learning. Camera angles were sufficient.

Overall I am unsure when or where I will use the moves. I have not used the moves yet.
I have purchased a dvd by the same company in the past sexy moves for the club? which i did like and did use some of the moves. I did practice mainly on my own due to me and my partner working different shifts so was hard to find time to come together. I prefer the teaching methods of moves rather than choreography as it creates better moves to use in real life situations.

I cant see my self ever using the first two moves from the DVD as they are pure salsa and I have never been to any location which plays salsa music. Although these moves are easy to follow and learn. The moves on the whole dvd are very informative. The 3rd move was a little more complicated and more thought process was required it also gave a more 'natural' look. i quite liked the 4th step and tweeked it alittle so I could possibly use it in a club maybe. I prefer this move on my own and not with a partner; as i think it looks better. I do find it a little hard to believe that these moves can be used with any kind of music like it stated on the dvd - although I have not had chance to test this yet. I can see myelf possibly using the 5th move. tHE CROSS SALSA STEP AND side to side step was a nice move. I also quite liked the last two moves on the  dvd.

Overall this is  a well taught DVD and would be very good for those who are interested in this type of dance style. Very good teachers and very good information.",1391904000,4,2608,3.998080614203455
5132176,5,B00855O5QM,"After reviewing this instructional dance DVD, I must say that I found the instructors to be very good teachers. Both are spontaenous and actively engage your attention, and they know how the exact type of problems that we might encounter (like getting dizzy etc.) while learning along. This is the second DVD I have tried from learnoutloud.com, and both did not disappoint me. Both instructors do a good job highlighting the little nuances that you should watch out for, and these nuances are different for the guy and girl.

Each dance move is broken down into individual sections on the DVD, so I can easily switch to watching any of the moves I want quickly. I would recommend watching through the whole thing first to see all the dance moves, and then pick the best ones you want to learn first. A couple of the moves are pretty advanced though, so you have to be patient and thankfully both of them make it simple and step-by-step.

If you have little experience with dancing like me, but need a quick way to learn simple, 1-2-3-4 step by step instructional dance videos that make you look immediately impressive on the dance floor, I would highly recommend check out this DVD.",1390608000,,1182,4.677884615384615
5132177,4,B00855O5QM,"The video is great for someone who has zero background in dancing. Fun, easy, and broken down very well. It is a little clumsy to access the different steps, but that is a minor complaint.",1390348800,,188,4.4
5132178,4,B00855O5QM,The steps are very easy to follow and learn.  It's great for beginners and those that can already dance! The couple do a great job of presenting the steps with flare.,1384387200,,166,4.354838709677419

5132183,5,B00855O5QM,"Do you think you can't move the way everyone else does?  It is tough enough when you are freestylin' solo - think you could never master dancing with a partner?  Well....think again.  This DVD will break it down so it is actually easy, fun, and enough to impress all of your friends and family.  They will think you have been dancing for years.  Who needs an excuse to put on your dancing shoes?  You will want to spend your Saturday nights in front of the DVD - even if you have no place to go to show off your dancing!  There is a choreographed dance that you and your partner can master....as well as tons of other moves you can show off on the dance floor.  Definitely worth the money!!",1354492800,,690,4.253846153846154
5132184,4,B00855O5QM,I truly enjoyed previous DVDs from club dance and was excited to see one that I could do with my husband. It is easy to follow and lots of fun!,1354492800,2,143,3.8

8525247,5,B00855O5QM,This product is exactly what I was looking for! I couldn't be happier with my choice. Each dance technique was easy to follow and clearly explained. The instructors maintained great pace throughout each move as I followed along. Great camera work as well. I have a busy schedule with work and it's nice to have a product that allows you to practice on your own time in the comforts of your living room.,1450137600,,402,4.52054794520548

8525249,2,B00855O5QM,Was very disappointed.  The DVD was based mostly on Salsa - for the much younger crowd.  Not at all what I expected.,1419033600,3,116,4.2272727272727275

8525252,1,B00855O5QM,"Super confusing!  I am used to mirrored instructions, so that you follow as you see it.  This is not, and I had a difficult time trying to follow.",1405900800,6,146,4.178571428571429
8525253,1,B00855O5QM,"I wish I could have rated this a zero as giving a single star may imply it has some type of value when in fact it is not only useless, it is actually frustrating to try to learn anything from.

Im really a generally positive guy, so let me start with what is good about this DVD:

1.  Both instructors are decent looking (the girl may be revealing a bit much, but i'm not complaining about that).

2.  The overall quality of the footage is decent along with the audio and music however generic it may be.

Now allow me to break down where this DVD fails miserably:

1.  Mass Confusion:
 Get ready for mass confusion because right away the instructor is going to inform you that when he moves his right foot you are to move your left foot, however he will never again repeat this throughout the remainder of the video nor will he even tell you which foot he is starting on the majority of the time or ever tell you which foot to start with.  Plus he constantly changes his location and direction on the screen.  He will constantly say ""this foot"" and ""the same foot""
Mirroring the instructors works to some extent while they are both facing you, but once they face each other we have to realize that when he moves his left, we move our right which feels totally goofy, especially be it that they never say ""left"" or ""right"", just ""this"" or ""that""
Once they get into actually dancing you will become so lost and frustrated you are likely to begin arguing amongst one another in a desperate attempt to avoid hitting the pause and rewind buttons on your remote.

2.  Cant be legit moves
 I cannot help but imagine that this instructor created most of the moves out of thin air, which may not have been so bad if he knew what he was doing.  His turns don't look good plus they are near impossible to learn.  Atop that, when any of the moves they teach are finished they end up with flat, straight feet that are not ready to get back into a rhythm Plus, for a good bit of the more complicated moves they either only teach the leaders foot moves or visa versa, or neither at all.

3.  All over the place
 The Dvd has a totally awkward structure as although they may start with the basics of salsa, they then get into a different dance all together, teach random moves that they call good for anyplace or any music and often without breaking down the steps at all.  We were expecting them to put it all together towards the end, but that never happened.

In closing,
Years ago I tried a few other dane lesson DVDs and I will say that by far this series of videos are by far the worse.  Yes, I had the unfortunate luck of buying a few from this same series all at once.
This DVD purchase not only cost us the money of the purchase price, but also our time, lots of headaches, and a lot of confusion.  Im still not sure what to do with any of what I just went through.  Hence I not only do not recommend this DVD I also want to warn people to stay far, far away from it.",1398124800,16,2960,4.207446808510638
8525254,4,B00855O5QM,"The dancing pair do a good job of showing how to be fluid and relaxed on the dance floor.  There is more Salsa Dancing than I would prefer, but it is different and the basics are covered well.",1396310400,,192,4.052631578947368
