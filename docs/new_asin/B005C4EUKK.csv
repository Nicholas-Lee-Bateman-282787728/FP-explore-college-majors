If you think you may have been born at the wrong time and perhaps in the wrong country.  If you have ever believed in love.  This book is for you.  It is genuinely timeless.",1377734400,3,308,4.083333333333333
8464758,5,B005C4EUKK,"Lyrical, compelling, haunting--perfectly in the spirit of the incomparable novel that inspired it.
