Teachers like that the film is short.  Hoping to show support to anyone trying to keep the memory of those ""difficult to talk about times"" in our history.",1490572800,,331,4.655172413793103
8333328,2,B001PIHOUA,"I hate to give this 2 stars, for I have awesome respect for these guys, and what they endured for us! Still, the DVD was quite short and overpriced for what it contained. The worst part was the fellow who spoke of his hell he endured. I could understand very little of what he had to say, and that ruined the whole thing for me.",1487894400,,328,4.061538461538461
