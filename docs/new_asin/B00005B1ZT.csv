7936294,2,B00005B1ZT,"1995 was the busiest year yet of Don Wilson's film career: not only was this the beginning of his stint as a commentator for the UFC, but he also appeared in five movies - the most he's ever done in a single year. Disappointingly, things didn't start off on a good foot, with the sixth installment of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>&nbsp;franchise not being a particularly strong vehicle or a particularly good action movie. One of the weaker&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>&nbsp;imitators I've watched, it seems to do the trick for established Dragon fans but probably won't interest action devotees in general.

The story: when an Islamic terrorist squad hijacks a nuclear missile launch site in America, the only man capable of stopping their plans is military courier Sergeant Nick Corrigan (Wilson).

One thing I've got to hand to the film is that it wastes no time in getting underway: the bad guys are infiltrating the underground base within the movie's opening ten minutes, and Don is dropped into the thick of things so quickly that he has next to no time to establish any kind of character, thereby making Nick Corrigan one of the most interchangeable characters Wilson has played. The story ends up being fairly generic, with lead villain Jonathan Fuller (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Castle-Freak/dp/157347049X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Castle Freak</a>) leading a team various bad guys which Wilson must dispatch one-by-one while alternating contact to the outside with a sympathetic major (Robin Curtis,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-IV-The-Voyage-Home/dp/B002I9Z8BM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</a>) and a jerkish general (Wynn Irwin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hart-to-Hart/dp/B000GRU09I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hart to Hart</a>). It gets pretty boring at times, but temporary reprieve is offered by occasional scenes of absurdity, such as the terrorists fooling the military with a trick involving bunnies, Wilson deflecting machine gunfire with a trashcan, and (SPOILER) ultimately saving the day by throwing caution to the winds and shooting up all computers in sight, somehow stopping the missile launch in the process.

Like most of Wilson's flicks, this one's decently cast with a fair selection of martial artists, including kickboxers Alex Desir and Dennis Keiffer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat-Annihilation/dp/0780622057/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</a>), Billy Blanks' brother Michael (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Expect-No-Mercy/dp/B00030WW58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Expect No Mercy</a>), and the late karate great Howard Jackson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Contact/dp/6302865239/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Contact</a>). Not all of them get to fight, but most do, and while the five brawls are generally beneath my level of acceptance, they're probably among Don's better ones, especially since they've were choreographed by the perpetual underachiever of fight direction, Art Camacho (see most of Wilson's flicks between 1992 and 2002).

Somewhat surprisingly, the movie makes a bit of a statement about the technical security of America's nuclear facilities needing to be updated to withstand the threats of the computer age. I hope that in the eighteen years since this movie was made, the people in charge have taken its advice to heart; I don't feel particularly safe if America's deadliest weapons are being monitored by computers that are responsive to being shot.  I also didn't feel particularly well while watching this movie, but I'm less concerned about that - Wilson's films tend to have that effect on me. Again, buy it if you're already a fan, but otherwise looks elsewhere for your kicks.",1360108800,,4205,6.837686567164179
7936295,3,B00005B1ZT,"Ground Zero really is a cheap knock-off on Die Hard.  I was ok with that because I was expecting more martial arts skills going into this film.  And after seeing the last 2 above average Bloodfist movies - parts 4 & 5 - I thought part 6 would keep the trend going.  Unfortunately, everything is wrong with this film and turns out to be an average, predicatable, and almost boring movie at best.

Since this is a Die Hard knock-off, you pretty much already know what the outcome will be, and you pretty much will know the succession of events.  Group of terrorists take over a nuclear missle base and threaten to target big cities in exchange for large sums of money.  Don Wilson plays our hero named Nick Carrigan, and basically fights through the bad guys one at a time till he gets the job done.

The terrorists themselves are not convincing charcaters.  They are supposed to be Middle-Eastern but mostly look Caucasian.  Even still, their performances are poorly convincing, and the boss charcater is just that as well.  Two of the terrorists are played by Michael Blanks (Dragon Fire, The Circuit) and Art Camacho, (pretty much either in every martial art film or the choreographer for) so I was hoping for some good fights with these guys.  As with all the fights in the movie, they last 30 seconds at most, putting them at the quickest fights seen yet in all of the Bloodfist movies.  Michael Blanks was still my favorite, because of his beautiful unique kicking style.

I'd almost give a 2 stars for this film, but Wilson is fun to watch in his action scenes, he has some great kicking moments that look great.  I just wish there was more than 30 second long fights.  The rest of the film is predictable and fairly unexciting.  Lets hope the remainder of the Bloodfist series can end on a stronger note.",1184112000,,1810,4.557275541795666
7936296,4,B00005B1ZT,"I actually really liked Bloodfist IV and V as the stories were decent along with the action, so in turn I had higher expecations for Bloodfist VI. BF VI jus comes off being another hooky Die Hard rip-off with some terrorists breaking into a nuclear missle base and threatening to explode one. Now its up to Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson to stop them. If you found the other B-action entries into this series enjoyable, you might find some enjoyment in this entry. I basically own it to complete my Bloodfist collection.",1102636800,,513,4.648351648351649
7936297,5,B00005B1ZT,"Here comes the latest of the DIE HARD knock offs, only this is one of the good ones. Don ""The Dragon"" is Nick Corrigan, a military courier who was demoted for the wrong reasons and who packs a mean punch. He's on his way to a U.S. nuclear missile launch site at the same time when terrorists have shown up and taken control. Led by the charismatic ""Party of Allah"" Arab terrorist Fawkes (Jonathan Fuller), they have made demands for $100 million or they'll start shooting nukes at U.S. cities. Of course, their bad guys, and even if they get their money, they'll still shoot an ICBM at NYC. Corrigan shows up to try to stop them, using his martial arts skills to get the job done. As I said, this is one of our DIE HARD knock offs, but as I also said, this one of the good ones;in fact, it's one of the best, with more kung fu fighting and cooler sets than most of the others. Don ""The Dragon"" clearly is a world champion and, like I've said before in my reviews, is not as bad an actor as most other critics peg him as. Each and every one of the BLOODFIST films should've made it to theatres, not just the first three. I'm still debating with myself over whether GROUND ZERO or DIE TRYING are the best in the series, but I suppose it doesn't matter. As long as Don ""The Dragon"" can still carry a action film on his pinky their kick [boo-te] kung fu flicks.",1055376000,4,1357,4.203065134099617
