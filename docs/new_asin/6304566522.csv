First, this was a BBC production for TV, not a mainstream theatrical release so considering the budget for Saint Ex was low, the director did a masterful job.  Second, most British films do not tell stories with a Hollywood-like narrative.. They don't just show you everything and assume you know the subject you're watching so the viewer themselves can fill in the gaps.  Third, Miranda Richardson is simply gorgeous in this film and plays St Exupery's wife flawlessly.  Every other film I've seen on the Little Prince including the 1974 film with Gene Wilder and big budget animated film released last year was simply horrid & dreadful!  They're made for children and this movie is not.  Here you not only gives glimpses into Saint Exupery's personality but connects the dots so one can see all the various influences in his life which made the Little Prince possible..  It's an extremely good film but you the viewer have to go into it with the desire to see something a bit artsy and with a relaxed pace, otherwise you will probably not like it.",1505779200,,1152,4.787878787878788
7874257,1,6304566522,"You may think that it would be impossible to make a boring film about the exciting life of French aviator and writer Antoine de St. Exupery.  You're wrong.  This filmmaker achieves it!

By chopping up his life into bits and pieces, scrambling them, presenting such brief snippets that it is impossible to feel anything for any of the characters, this filmmaker has achieved the impossible and made St. Ex totally boring.

Maybe someday a decent filmmaker will come along and do St. Exupery justice.",1140998400,8,498,4.892857142857143
