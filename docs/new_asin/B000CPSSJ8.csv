8100158,3,B000CPSSJ8,"I am giving this a 3 star rating because it really lacks some very specific information. At one point they talk how they get the poles from one location to another and never do talk or show the setup they used. Also when showing which jigs they were using and setups. There were no close-ups of any of the lures suggested.
At one point he talks about fishing at a 12' depth in about 8' or so of water. Didn't see any film shots of that either. I feel that this is a great beginning, beginning, beginning video. It does a great job of advertising the different brands of product that sponsor him. But, it lacks detail on location, set-up, and rigging. If you know anything at all about spider rigging. Go somewhere else. I really don't think it is worth the money for what you pay. I am still looking for a more informative source.",1382400000,,830,4.326923076923077
