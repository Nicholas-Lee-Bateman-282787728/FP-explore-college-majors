7900796,5,8015356695,Since seeing the movie Ragamuffin last year I have become aware of all the other ragamuffins out there who are trying to understand the love of God in much the same way Rich Mullins did. This video sheds a little more light on Rich's life and the circumstances that brought such depth and meaning to his music. The video was very well done.,1427932800,2,340,4.412698412698413

7900800,5,8015356695,"This video of the musical legacy of Rich Mullins was phenomenonal. Such diversity, creativity and talent. Undoubtedly the no. 1 Christian musician of our time. Vocals, piano, guitar, hammer dulcimer.....this man did it all-plus the best lyrics of any musician who sought to enlighten others on his spiritual path. If you know nothing of this man's music and life you owe it to yourself to see and hear one of the truly inspirational Christian musicians and men of our time. This man was no slacker-----he gave nearly everything he earned to his church and the poor of the world. He just may be the greatest Christian man of the 2oth century...............",1376265600,3,655,4.90990990990991
7900801,5,8015356695,This a story of a unique but not so unique man. A man I wish I had gotten to know.,1353542400,5,82,3.15
7900802,5,8015356695,"I owned this video on vhs for at least 15 years and last month donated it to the local thrift store along with other older videos (thinking I could find this on dvd), when I realized I gave it away, I went to the thrift store asking sales people if they had it in the back or if someone was holding it for themselves with no success. Aaaugh, I was disappointed, but HOPED that the new owner of the video knew what it was and is sharing it with others.
Rich Mullins for me is the true essence of what Christian artistry is all about. His life, his music, his words... his love for people demonstrated a sacrifice that not many others can bear. I have never met this man, but I have loved him and am enriched by the love he shared with me. Where I'm from, most people only know him for his ""Awesome God"" song. That was only a tip of the iceberg of talents granted to this servant of God.
Homeless Man is poetic. Homeless Man is love. Homeless Man is ""What Would Jesus Do"" should he live among us again.
Thank you Rich Mullins, and most of all thank you God!",1353369600,12,1055,4.12621359223301
7900803,5,8015356695,I watched this movie 15 years ago and Rich's lifestyle still is ingrained in my head. His walk for the lord was intense and serious. A very encouraging film. Get it.,1292544000,6,165,4.354838709677419
7900804,5,8015356695,"A must have video for everyone.
A life well lived and a great example of a man putting his treasure where his heart is. If only more Christians had the thought of God like Rich Mullins did. Amazing insightful video.",1247616000,7,215,4.4
