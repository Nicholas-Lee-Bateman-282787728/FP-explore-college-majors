8144722,4,B000IAZ8GI,Order was correct but I wanted the PBS version of this TV special.  I waited and finally recorded the PBS version on my DVD recorder. Both versions are very similar.,1294272000,,165,4.5
8144723,5,B000IAZ8GI,"This is an excellent show performed before a live audience.  Richard Abel is somewhat reminiscent of Liberace but considerably less flamboyant.  The DVD offers a choice of watching the performance in French, with commentary and song introductions by Mr. Abel, or in English in which these are beautifully translated.  Many, but not all, are wonderful waltzes, some of which are rarely heard, and others of world renown. This is appropriate for all ages and a breath of fresh air.  I enjoyed both versions (even though I don't speak French) and the 3 bonus clips.  I would highly recommend it.",1161302400,5,592,4.9393939393939394
