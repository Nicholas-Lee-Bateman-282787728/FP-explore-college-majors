7052089,5,B00ULQSAY6,"I've had no exposure to Krav Maga before, but I've done a few kickboxing videos from Jillian Michaels.  Overall it's a good workout - not as hard as Insanity by Shaun T, and definitely more accessible to the common man!  There are a few terms that aren't explained, but because the instructor demonstrates the moves first and then has you practice them 2 times slowly, it's easy enough to catch on.",1453507200,14,398,4.591549295774648

7052095,5,B00ULQSAY6,"Krav Maga has been my home training staple for a few years now. But the dvd's are dated and out of production. So it is a pleasure to come across Michael South and his ""Krav Maga Workout"" dvd. This dvd is high quality in production and instruction. Michael South is clear and direct in demonstrating the move then he is right there doing the exercise with you. Plus the facilities are certainly of professional grade.
I may very well make this my go to workout dvd because of the Krav Maga and cardio, upper/lower body conditioning and flexibility routines combined .",1430179200,18,567,4.623762376237623

7052097,5,B00ULQSAY6,"I really like how the movements are explained when you first do them, then they are done slowly a couple of times to make sure you have the technique down.

7052102,5,B00ULQSAY6,"This is the missing link for solo training Krav Maga.  There are dozens of books, dvds, and internet videos teaching technical movements but there isn't a single video of an actual class or instruction in how to sculpt your training regimen.  I have trained in class in 8 different KM schools and they are all different with few exceptions.  However they all share the same core class plan.  Light warm up, stretch, followed by a fitness regimen, then on to practicing defenses and striking and then a cool down.  This video give you as close to an actual class that I think you'll ever find.  Video is clear and has good quality filming.  I would recommend this to anyone especially beginners and/or solo practitioners who are looking to put together their own training models.  Hope this helps. Train hard but drink beer and eat cake!",1491091200,4,836,4.7172413793103445
7052103,5,B00ULQSAY6,Great DVD set. Helping me to improve my flexibility and improved  my  Krav Maga. Very well done comma I will be ordering more in the future.,1490572800,,140,4.346153846153846
7052104,5,B00ULQSAY6,"Love This DVD, I'm just getting back into a fitness regime and not quite ready to go to the gym and this video gives me a really intense workout in the privacy of my own home, while this is not a KRAV MAGA fighting video it does utilize the basic moves ...can't wait to try the other's in his series.",1490400000,,300,4.016666666666667
7052105,5,B00ULQSAY6,"Love these workouts, they are going to compliment the rest of my training. I do calisthenics, kettlebells and circuit training (now Krav), as well as yoga every morning and cycling five or six days a week.

There are two workouts each about 40 minutes long with a warm-up and cool-down. There is also two separate flexibility routines to help out if you aren't that flexible yet. So there is lots of content. The instructor does the moves two times slowly so you can learn the moves, then you begin the round. Flexibility and joint mobility is very important to me, so I appreciate the variety of stretches in the workout as well as in the warm-up and cool down. I'm pretty flexible but this has some new stretches I've never done. There is a good balance of stretching, combatives, cardio and core work. Also, there is a good variety within each workout. I don't think there are two combinations that are repeated.

I'm new to any kind of martial arts so some of the terms could use a little explanation ie: ""elbows #5"" and ""ridge strike"", I think it was. Maybe these are explained in another video, but maybe a quick description of terms and strikes at the beginning or something. So I emailed the owner of the company these questions, and he responded right away. Even sent links to YouTube videos by instructors not affiliated with his company. The demonstration videos were a big help. Great customer service!

I like the pace of them too, they're not too fast nor slow. It doesn't feel like working out, you just follow along... next thing you know, you've done an awesome workout. It's fun!

This video will get you fit, toned and give you a few new skills. It would be good as a stand-alone routine or mixed in with your current training. Highly recommend!",1490313600,2,1764,4.60828025477707
7052106,5,B00ULQSAY6,"Below is the email I sent to the instructor in this DVD.  My son & I are loving it.

""Hi Michael ~ I just purchased your Krav Maga workout DVD from Amazon. Great workout! My 13 year old son and I are doing the workout together and it's great father/son bonding. I'm 6' 1"" 225lbs with a muscular build [I do mostly body resistance training] but HATE cardio as it bores me to death. With your Krav Maga DVD, I'm dripping in sweat at the end of a workout with a smile on my face. For us old guys, I'm 43, all of the pre and post stretching is a game changer. Keep up the great work. If we lived anywhere near one of your studios, I would have you give my son and I private lessons.""",1485907200,,679,3.948905109489051

7052111,5,B00ULQSAY6,this was a bit different from other workouts videos in that it's a pretty straight forward instructional video. The routines are a good mix of Krav Maga instruction and conditioning exercises. Anyone can follow along and go at your own pace.,1475971200,,241,4.902439024390244

7052113,5,B00ULQSAY6,"I was definitely surprised by how much I like this workout and the instructor's delivery.  It's a straightforward, effective workout.  I've used different ""MMA"" workout DVDs like GSP Rushfit and UFC Fit, which I like and still use, but I find the Krav Maga Workout to be a better workout for me to fit into my weight routine.

I've taken a few Krav Maga classes, so the techniques were a great refresher.  I will continue to use the workouts and stretch routines on this DVD until the disc wears out, then I'll order another one.

Great video workout - without the ads for shakes and other stuff I don't want.",1470355200,3,609,4.5

This Krav Maga video taught me some new self defense moves and is a great workout.  Not too difficult or too easy.  I'm looking forward to stepping up the intensity as I become more accustomed to the moves (which are easy to learn!)

7052118,5,B00ULQSAY6,This is a heck of a workout. 2 fitness and 2 stretching sessions. I am studying Krav Maga and Shaolin Kempo at a Dojo and believe they complement each other well. This DVD definitely enhances my workouts with both Krav Maga techniques and FITNESS. I recommend this DVD.,1463443200,8,269,4.625
7052119,5,B00ULQSAY6,I like the training videos.  they make me sweat and i am tired afterwards so i am happy.  i like that i can complete them in about 30 minutes which is better than other workout dvds which are much longer for about the same workout,1462060800,2,230,4.088888888888889

The only thing I would suggest is more care as far as handling the product before and during shipping. I ordered the workout dvd and the basic combatives dvd. I recieved the basic combatives dvd case broken on one corner but tge dvd worked perfectly so I kept, and the workout dvd scratched due to it not being placed correctly in the case. I inspected the dvd and noticed scratches on it but still decided to try it in the player. After trying the dvd it started to stop and skip so I returned it thru amazon and bought a replacement. I quickly received the replacement and had the same issue with the dvd not placed correctly in the case and scratched, tried the dvd and it worked this time around so I went ahead and kept it. I just think its a shame such a good video has these production issues.",1456272000,6,901,4.305882352941176

7052124,5,B00ULQSAY6,"I was able to go through both workouts this weekend. Although I do utilize other DVD programs to get martial arts cardio training, I am new to Krav Maga. I did find it more useful in respect to utilizing actual combative moves versus cardio moves (continuous punching and kicking like other DVDs) and I liked that it incorporated abs, squats and burpees. I did break a sweat on both workouts which is always the goal and was pleased with the results. I can rotate in these workouts for days that I can only get 30 min. cardio in or for two-a-days as a second workout.",1454889600,7,567,4.40952380952381

8707354,2,B00ULQSAY6,"I am writing this review as someone who has trained in krav maga for 6 years and who has instructed both civilians and law enforcement personnel in this great self-defense system. Krav maga was developed by Imi Lichtenfeld to enable people to defend against all kinds of attacks, including life-threatening ones. Therefore, techniques must be executed carefully and completely during practice, so that the user will do them well automatically under duress. The goal of civilian use of krav maga is to end a threat and remain uninjured. This DVD presents a set of exercises that provide a well-rounded workout. Michael South is clearly in good condition and sets an example for being flexible and able to sustain continuous activity. However, the krav maga part of many of the exercises is very poorly done. The techniques South utilizes are often inconsistent (sometimes done one way, sometimes anotheras with his front straight kicks that he calls thrust kicks, where at times he pushes his foot forward at an imaginary target and at other times in the same sequence he flips his foot upward). In actual defensive situations many of his techniques would not protect the defender and would help the attacker to win. I recognize that South presents his techniques in other DVDs. But much of the krav maga that he shows here would not work well in a real-life encounter. Here are some other examples: 1) In executing kicks he usually drops his hands, leaving his head vulnerable; 2) In his choke defense (a life-threatening situation) he reacts with only one arm and does not secure the attackers arm, leaving one of his own arm at his side, with his head vulnerable; 3) In his knee circles he drops his hands, leaving his upper body vulnerable in what would be a close-in defensive situation; 4) He does not use any turning of his ground foot (base leg) in kicks and knees, something that adds significant reach to the target, eases force on the hips and is basic to effective krav maga. There are many other examples. As an exercise video this is fine, but it presents poorly executed techniques that are likely to give the attacker a great advantage. There are much better krav maga videos available.",1534896000,,2201,4.840848806366048

8707358,4,B00ULQSAY6,"I bought this DVD to mix up my workouts a bit and maybe teach myself a few Krav Maga moves... I am pretty happy with it.

I have no formal training in Krav Maga so I have no clue how accurate any of the moves are... I was only looking for a good workout that really got me sweating and moving to add to the videos I already use for some variety... gaining any actual knowledge of martial arts in the process is a fun bonus for me but not my ultimate goal.

PROS
-Good workout... really gets me sweating and sore the next day.
-Decent length.
-Interesting moves.
-I like that the moves are demonstrated at a good pace.

CONS
-Some of the instruction is a bit confusing.
-The guy is a bit mono-tone.
-Could have some more energetic music to get the blood pumping.",1522195200,,761,4.198630136986301
