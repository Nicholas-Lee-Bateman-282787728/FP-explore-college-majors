3528146,4,B001DB6J6Y,Had seen both Chances Are & Only You previously and enjoyed them again. I find that romantic comedies are entertaining and lift my spirits if I am having a bad day and both these films do that for me.,1352419200,,200,4.153846153846154
3528147,5,B001DB6J6Y,"Two very enjoyable movies. I have watched them at least a couple of times each. With all of the junk that's
out there on the market, it's nice to watch movies without all the filthy language and blood & guts.",1351296000,,208,4.225
3528148,5,B001DB6J6Y,"There aren't a lot of movies in the afterlife/reincarnation genre, but they tend to be pretty good.  Movies like ""Heaven Can Wait"", ""What Dreams May Come"" and ""Defending Your Life"" are fun to watch because we don't often think about what comes next.  That said, I originally purchased this DVD set for ""Chances Are"" and considered ""Only You"" as a bonus since I had never seen it.  Having now seen ""Only You"", I have to say that ""Chances Are"" is definitely the more ""Guy-friendly"" movie of this two-pack.  There are very few male characters in ""Only You"" and Robert Downey Jr does not appear until the movie is well underway.  ""Only You"" feels more like a Marisa Tomei and Bonnie Hunt's adventure film with Marisa chasing a childish dream with her unfortunate fiance left in the dust.

On the other hand, ""Chances Are"" is about a couple whose life together is cut short when the husband, Louie (Christopher McDonald), is hit by a car.  In heaven, Louie desperately struggles to get back to his wife but the only route back is via reincarnation.  In his haste to return to Earth, an angel forgets to administer the drug that will erase Louie's memories of his previous life.  Louie is reincarnated and grows up as a new person, Alex (Robert Downey Jr.), but his soul remains the same.  Alex forgets his old life but when he begins dating Louie's daughter, major complications ensue (obviously) as memories of his old life and his love for his wife, Corrine (Cybill Shepherd) resurface.

Robert Downey Jr. also happened to be in another pretty good and similar-themed ""afterlife"" movie, ""Heart and Souls"".",1335744000,2,1602,4.768115942028985
3528149,5,B001DB6J6Y,"An excellent package deal for any Robert Downey Jr. fan.
Two of his best romantic comedies for a great price.
Shipped in excellent time with the standard shipping.",1329264000,,163,4.857142857142857
3528150,5,B001DB6J6Y,This was a Christmas gift for my sister in law!  Asked for Only You and got a bonus video Chances Are.  She seemed to really  appreciate it...could hardly wait to get home and watch it!,1324857600,,185,4.228571428571429
3528151,5,B001DB6J6Y,"I was looking for those movies that bring me great memories and finding this duo was just unvaluable and simply great! :)

The best part is it came in English, Spanish and French audio and subtitles! :)
I understand and speak English very well but my husband doesn't so it was definitely a plus to find this with the audio in Latin SPanish (because in America -continent- for us latin people we prefer the ones translated here than the ones translated in Spain) so two thumbs up!
It is hard enough to find the movies around Amazon in Spanish so I think it was a great great plus! :)

The other great thing is that I had no problems with the zone, I own a free zone dvd but you always take the chances, nevertheless I had no problems with it. It just played fine and the quality of the video is amazing considering these 2 movies were filmed around 80's and 90's

totally recommended :)",1311638400,2,885,4.319277108433735

3528172,5,B001DB6J6Y,These are awesome movies! I love Robert Downey Jr's early work and these two movies show just how talented he is. And how he hasn't really aged at all. Chances Are and Only You are great movies from his early days.,1425600000,,214,4.2439024390243905

Cute story,  but I wanted to scream whenever she was in a scene ...  ""Only You""  is a wonderful film.  I have seen it several times and highly recommend it.",1407628800,,325,4.213114754098361

3528200,1,B001DB6J6Y,I sadly never got this chances are/only you dvd because it got lost in the mail but thankfully the 35 greely promptly returned my money so i still never got the movies so i cant review something i didn't get.it go lost in the bermuda triangle apparently,1389052800,,253,4.404255319148936
3528201,5,B001DB6J6Y,I was looking for these exact two movies so was thrilled to find them in a package.  I bought them as a gift.,1387152000,,109,3.739130434782609
3528202,5,B001DB6J6Y,"Chances Are gets 5 stars because it came with Only You! it's a sweet funny movie and because I obviously really love Robert Downey as an actor and Cybil Shepard,it is worth seeing .Cybils husband dies but the worker angels who are processing him,realize its a mistake so they have him be reborn as Robert Downey,and he meets Cybils grown up daughter,who invites him to her house to meet her mother! it's very cute and eventually Cybil marries Ryan O'Neal who has known her for yrs. And always has loved her! whew!
Only You is one of my favorites as it has this slight psychic twist .Its about a woman about to marry who starts wondering if the man she has picked, is right for her. A Wigi Board and a fortune teller both mention ,a man,s name that she believes is her soulmate! When she answers a call for her fianc,a man with her soul mates name says he's a friend of her fianc and says congratulations and that he is on his way to Rome,Italy! That does it she flys to Italy looking for him along with her sister-in-law,Bonnie Hunt,who is adorable! Through a series of crazy running around and losing her shoe,she meets Robert Downey,who is a shoe salesman in Italy at a convention.he falls for her and helps her look for the guy with the special name! the scenery is fabulous and the ending where they both actually talk to the guy with The Right Name...is fab. love the ending!",1381536000,,1380,4.437007874015748
3528203,5,B001DB6J6Y,Wonderful!  Both movies are even better than I remember them!  Overjoyed to have found them both together as one purchase.  Great price too!!!,1379462400,,142,5.086956521739131
3528204,5,B001DB6J6Y,"Only You is probably one of the cutest movies I've ever seen. Marisa Tomei is strikingly beautiful and adorable and the chemistry between her and Robert Downey Jr melts off the screen (they dated for several years after this movie, so that chemistry is clearly not only amazing acting). The storyline is really cute and the scenery is beautiful. It's definitely heart warming.

This two pack also includes Chances Are, which is a pretty interesting idea and Robert Downey Jr has really good chemistry with Cybill Shepherd even despite their large age differences. I've never been a huge fan of hers, but she is really impressive in this movie; you really believe all of the emotions she is portraying. Not to give too much away, the story is also a little bit heartbreaking.

You really can't go wrong buying these two wonderful movies for $15.",1377648000,,844,4.813793103448276
3528205,5,B001DB6J6Y,"Got this for Chances Are...it is a good movie, have watched it so many times! love the characters and the concept of

 Only You is alright too, have watched a couple of times.",1377216000,,333,4.285714285714286

3528218,5,B001DB6J6Y,I have no negatives about these movies. My likes are solely based on Robert Downey Jr.'s performance. I find him to be an amazing actor who can really deliver. These show his earliest years that put him at the top today.,1376611200,,220,4.390243902439025

3528224,4,B001DB6J6Y,"I recently saw ""Chances Are"" on TV and it was totally gutted with commercials.  It's a very enjoyable movie that leaves you smiling and I decided I wanted to see it in its entirety without commercial interruptions, and am very happy to have it in my collection.  Insofar as the ""Only You"" film is concerned, I had not seen it before, but as it was included in the low price, I decided why not get the ""two-pack.""  ""Only You"" leaves a bit to be desired story wise, but the scenery in Italy is breathtaking, as is Robert Downy Jr., so I appreciate the movie from that perspective.",1363824000,,578,4.383177570093458
