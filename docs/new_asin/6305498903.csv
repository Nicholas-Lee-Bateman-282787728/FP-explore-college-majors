1041100,2,6305498903,The main drawback to 200 cigarettes is that it jumped around too much and didn't allow for character development.  I enjoy Ben Affleck's acting but he can do so much better than this drivel.,953683200,2,190,4.588235294117647
1041101,4,6305498903,"This movie is a lot of fun.  No, it is not profound.  I really don't think it's trying to be.  It has cast full of good actors who play their characters to a tee and never really take themselves too seriously.  It's a  good movie if you take it for what it is: Fluff. If you're going to watch  this movie, don't expect profound insight and depth of character  development... expect self absorbed characters, neuroses, and silliness.  That's what you'll get.  And in my opinion, sometimes that's enough.  Sometimes it's a Shawshank Redemption day, but it's also okay to have a 200  Cigarettes night!",952300800,2,598,4.653846153846154
1041102,4,6305498903,"Following in the steps of The Wedding Singer, we are once again thrown back to the days of too much make up, with a charming and varied cast reminding us all too clearly of what the early 80s were like (whatever DID  happen to Cindi Lauper?).  The accents are too true, the scene is right,  and while this certainly wouldn't garner any Oscars, the movie was still  endearing and cute.  Not very high accolades for any movie, but kudos to  all the actors, who rolled well into their respective parts, from the  wannabee bartender, to the cabbie still sportin' an afro (hey, these are  the 80's man!  Get ridda that thing!), to the neurotic from Ronkonoma.  (Ronkonka who? ).  I'm not sure what the whole point of the movie was, but  then, that was the idea, perhaps:  the intertwined lives of several folks,  none the protagonist, each the star, in this one eventful New Years Eve of  1981.  Watch it.... and I dare to count all the cigarettes...",951609600,4,945,4.535714285714286

1041104,3,6305498903,For Me this movie was pretty bad. There was only one part that made me give it 3* is the ending when he was describing the party it was so FUNNY.  OTHER THEN THAT IT'S BAD.

1041106,5,6305498903,"A little slow getting started, but hey, I loved this movie!  Hearing Christina Ricci's accent at the begginning of the film  threw me off a bit. But all the characters in 200 cigarrettes transformed  into highly adorable, funky, quirky, 80's type personalities, (pause!),  cool people on a mission to party like it's 1999. There! I said it!  I especially liked Martha Plimpton's character. I was feeling so worried  when no one was showing up for her party.
This film is an engaging look  at one night in NYC, (actually filmed in ""real time"" I'm assuming).  It carries you along on this seemingly ill-fated New Years Eve, where everyone  has got love on the brain.  Primary mission: find someone special to share New  Years Eve with.  Who can't relate to that?!  With the Millineum coming up close,  this is a perfect movie to get into the spirit of things.  And if you don't  have that someone special in your arms that night, watch this movie. It  makes perfect company.",939600000,10,972,4.690476190476191

The great actors (before a lot of them were famous). A high-strung girl is throwing a new year's eve bash and is terrified that noone is going to show up so when 5 minutes after party time arrives and noone is there, she starts drinking heavily. Too bad, she passed out right  before everyone starts showing up for the party of the decade (with a great ""cameo appearance"" at the shindig). At least there are lots of pictures for her to see what a hit her party was and that she really did have ""friends"". Feel-good movie that is great to curl up and watch when feeling nostalgic or getting together with other friends from the 80's. It also crosses generations. My daughter got a kick out of  seeing how we did it in the 80's. Wore out 2 VHS copies before finding it on DVD.

This is one of those movies you probably never knew existed. I discovered it by accident several years ago and I loved that there were so many familiar actors in it playing roles that are different from what you've seen them in before.

I put it on my wish list and kept checking back til I found a ""Used - Very Good"" copy for not much more than $20. [Update: It appears this was re-released not long after I wrote this review, so it can now be had for cheap!]

Gotta say, I really enjoyed the movie! Several other reviews mentioned that it is a ""slow starter"" and ""good, but not a great movie"". I'd like to address those comments first:
- I wouldn't say it is a slow starter. There is just a LOT going on, and WAY too many characters to keep track of. What I did was watched about 35-40 minutes or so, then restarted the movie from the beginning. That's all it took, and I'm glad I did it that way. I was able to meet all the characters then go back and pay attention to the story.
- If you are looking for a blockbuster hit, then NO, you aren't going to think this is a ""great"" movie. But if you are really into Indie films and low budget stuff, and ESPECIALLY if you are all about early 80s nostalgia... well, I just can't see you not loving 200 Cigarettes!

Here is a brief description of the movie (withholding all spoilers - safe to read):  It is New Year's Eve 1981 in NYC. We follow the evening's events of a whole slew of eccentric characters, many of who's paths have crossed previously in life, as well as at different points throughout the film. They are all heading to the same party, but no one wants to get there too early. The NYE bash is hosted by Martha Plimpton, who spends most of the movie agonizing over her pathetic party that no one has shown up to.

I'm very happy I was able to add this to my movie library without spending a fortune. If this is something you've wanted to see, I highly recommend it.",1360972800,4,1893,4.135869565217392

The premise is like many other movies at this time where a dozen subplots and 30 odd characters finally converge in a grand coda.  The problem is that none of the individual stories are very good, most of the characters are completely unlikable and the conclusion is so predicable and unsatisfying that you buy the DVD just to find out which bands were in the soundtrack so you can buy their MP3's.",1360022400,,493,4.52808988764045

The soundtrack, likely making more money than the film itself, cannot camouflage a complete waste of acting talent.

The far too busy screenplay lumbers along with one forced screwball situation after another. First-time director Risa Bramon Garcia, who's barely made a film in the decade since, bit off more than she could chew with this attempt at recreating the magic of George Lucas'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Graffiti/dp/B0044WSF5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Graffiti</a>&nbsp;and Richard Linklater's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dazed-and-Confused/dp/B003WLQGC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dazed and Confused</a>.

""200 Cigarettes"" is an aggressively manic ensemble chronicling 80's kids adorned in leather and green. There's epic bed-hopping in the year before AID's terror swept the land. Perhaps Garcia, working with Shana Larsen's clumsy script, was trying to forge a snapshot of the last gasps of a physically uninhibited time, but the entire work lacks contemplative vision.

Roughly five stories interlock, occasionally narrated by taxi driver Disco Cabbie (Dave Chappelle). Monica (Martha Plimpton) is having a party in her picturesque loft, but everyone is running late. Ellie (Janeane Garofalo) broke up with Kevin (Paul Rudd), so he's devastated while hanging at the coffee shop with Lucy (Courtney Love). New Jersey Val (Christina Ricci) has a fake ID and gets lost at a punk club where she meets Tom (Casey Affleck). Cindy (Kate Hudson) lost her virginity to Loverboy Jack (Jay Mohr), and they're on a second date. A hunky bartender (Ben Affleck) serves everyone a drink with a smile. I've left out quite a few characters who, in a roundabout way, are migrating towards Monica's loft with the speed of salmon.

With great frustration, we've been waiting the entire film for this mass of humanity to make it to the party, a final act where loose ends are tied together. Much to my anguish, ""200 Cigarettes"" abruptly concludes the moment they walk through the door, one of the film's many gimmicks. Compounding this failure is a tacked on ending (filmed in post-production?) where characters awaken on New Year's Day with partners least expected. Disco Cabbie, a sort of inner-city holy man spouting philosophical advice, displays throwaway Polaroid snapshots from the countdown festivities - yet another gimmick. So I've essentially watched a movie about a party that entirely misses the party.

Anyway, I came of age in the 1980s within the smokey confines of punk rock clubs and warehouse gatherings. While watching ""200 Cigarettes, I knew full well the costumes were off target, mixing modern trends with exaggerated imaginings. The music at the hardcore club was also wrong, but a soundtrack with Minor Threat (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-Step/dp/B000S584EQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of Step</a>) or The Misfits (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MisFits-Collection/dp/B000000I3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MisFits- Collection</a>) is not going to sell particularly well. Amidst the busy charade, I liked Plimpton's performance, displaying great comedic timing. Love is also surprisingly good as the wild child with a sympathetic ear. Her presence reminded me of my own 1980's moment when college friends and I arrived at Austin's Continental Club to see the unknown band Hole (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Through-This/dp/B000003TAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live Through This</a>). Alas, Love and her band were a no-show.

Perhaps we should write a screenplay about that?",1354320000,,5250,6.936459909228442

I must have not paid close enough attention to detail because when it arrived, it was in ITALIAN!!! Oh no!!! I remember reading the description and the details but somehow I overlooked this MAJOR detail. I realize it is my fault. I wondered why it took so long to ship; because it came from ITALY. This was only the second purchase I have made via AMAZON, and it was obviously a failure. Haha. Better luck next time. Thank you, though, it looks perfect. Perhaps this will be inspiration to learn the Italian language.",1344902400,,615,4.6

It's set in '81, and the chance to see all the ridiculous hairstyles alone is enough to get me interested. But another thing you should know is that it's jam packed full of hilarious and talented actors. We've got Dave Chappelle, Paul Rudd, Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck, Kate Hudson, Janeane Garofalo, Courtney Love, Jay Mohr, Christina Ricci, and even Elvis Costello...among many others. I guarantee that if you have even the slightest sense of humor you'll be laughing within the first minute!

Easily a cult classic. Hip in the non-squarest sense of the word. Comedy for people who like actual comedy. There is a strong enough romantic side to it to keep the ladies interested. Several lines worthy of daily quoting. Killer soundtrack. Awesome script. The list goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on....

The whole movie takes place over one new year's eve in new york and is so entertaining, wickedly funny with an intelligent comic scenes throughout the movie. Everybody managed to act so naturally; when they are drunk, happy or angry it is breathtaking and makes you giggle all the way.

Ben Affleck, Courtney Love, Kate Hudson, Paul Rudd, Dave Chapelle, Janeane Garofalo, Christina Ricci all in one movie!

Highlights issues like friendship between a guy and a girl, then getting drunk and messing it up, falling in love, virginity& innocence, despair on new years eve on getting off with any guy, teenagers& punks and the madness about this endless night. Rumour has it that they really do smoke 200 cigs during the film.

Martha Plimpton is a riot as the overwrought hostess with a failed party on her hands.

Ben Affleck is actually semi-funny for once- he is trying desperately to get into someone's pants- watch and see who he starts the new year with.

Courtney Love and Paul Rudd are friends- she wants to be more but she scares him....

Indy gal J. Garafolo is her dark and dismal chain smoking wisecracking self and fun again.

Dave Chappel is the cabby who tells the tale.

1041685,2,6305498903,"I found this movie somewhat entertaining, although the intertwining stories were a mixed bag of annoying and fun. Unfortunately the fact that the stories each receive only limited attention, and the story changes from one focus to another storyline entirely just as things start to seem interesting, makes this film a bit frayed and taxing to the patience. Nevertheless, the film is about a whole host of young people, dressed up and heading for a party (ostensibly Martha Plimpton's party), but they never quite make it there. Plimpton, someone I never really cared for, is actually rather funny in this role, and in fact hilarious when she misses her own party (and her idol, Elvis Costello). Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman are both quite funny; Courtney Love, Paul Rudd and Janeane Garofalo are also quite a trio. Overall this is light comedy; nothing special but still worth the effort.",1110585600,3,892,4.993288590604027
1041745,5,6305498903,"Wow! Being a fan of Courtney Love's music, and acting at some times, I vowed to see all of her movies. This one was next on the list, besides Basquiat. I was going to rent it, but my local movie store had 2 copies on VHS for sale for $2.99, I knew I couldn't pass it up. The film is set up like a soap opera, ya know? where the camera flits from person to person, and situation to situation. Its hilarious! This movie is great! I love seeing some REAL punk rockers in this film, as opposed to all the posers of today, (okay they might be actors but who cares?) 200 Cigarettes features an all star lineup, of todays hottest new actors. And most of the acting is suprisingly realistic. My favorite part of the whole movie is when Dave Chapelle(The disco loving taxi driver) tells a ""heart warming story"" of when he was jealous of a friend because he had a girl he wanted, and the friend ""Twayne"" ended up choking on a string bean. And Courtney Love portrays her character in the way that she REALLY is in real life. Its really ironic how similar her character and her true demeanor are.",1104192000,2,1084,4.266990291262136
1041746,4,6305498903,"I had to give this one 4 stars just because it is so fun.  It is deeply flawed at points and as deep as a puddle, yet it is funny and still has some moving moments.  The nostalgia factor works as well if you were out and about at the time.  Affleck comes across a big dope, but that's okay (cuz I think he is).  Ricci is great - why is she so underutilized?  That girl has a power in her.  Rudd is the sweet sort of everyman good guy and it suits him well.  Love is, well, actually ... good here.  I liked her and I felt for her character. Hudson is very, very funny, particularly in her scenes with Jay Mohr - they have great chemistry.  Garoffalo is the best in a tart-tounged smaller part.  Definitely worth a spin for an easy-on-the-eyes comedy.

1041747,4,6305498903,"A very funny and insightful examination of young adults all looking for love, happiness and meaning. The film takes place on new year's eve, 1981, and follows many different young people who somehow all eventually end up at the same party (which the hostess later wakes up to find she slept through.) Elvis Costello makes a cameo and provides a running joke in the last third. The soundtrack is great--all late 70's early 80's pop and new wave. And the one who steals the show is Dave Chappelle as the cab driver who manages to give a ride to practically every character at some point, dispensing equally silly and profound wisdom along the way, on everything from friendship and destiny to life before an afro and how to ""get booty."" (smiling at a girl is very important, as is avoiding talking about death--""Everyone knows they're gonna die someday, they just don't want to hear it from you."") Ben Affleck is very amusing as a clueless suitor. Oh, and Courtney Love was actually bearable. All in all, a very smart, enjoyable ride.",1091145600,5,1032,4.707182320441989

The film follows a bunch of young, 20-something people in East Village on New Years Eve 1981. The costumes are very eighties, the music is great and my favorite actress Kate Hudson was adorable in one of her first movie roles. The all-star cast; including Paul Rudd, Gaby Hoffman, Christina Ricci, Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck and Janeane Garofalo gives more stars than sneers. I also liked Martha Plimpton as cynical, grumpy Monica. The cameo by Elvis Costello was fine as well.",1035590400,,677,4.895652173913043

The movie sort of plodded along, not really going anywhere.  Sort of like a frustration dream--that never ends.  I do accept artistic license in film, even though Christina Ricci & Gaby Hoffman's accents weren't very good--their acting was.  I had the pleasure of living in NYC in 80's and sorry to say the costumes, make-up & slang were NOT authentic.  I really felt like it was a contemporary film.  I was searching for something real from 1981, after a while I kept asking myself, ""Why don't they just show the Mudd Club or Danceteria or CBGB's!""  At least they showed Gem Spa, and some other landmarks. That aside, it still could have been a good film.  I think the main problem was the aimlessness of the script.  And the direction--did everyone direct themselves?  The only things that kept my interest--were the music and the fine young actors, who did not have much to work with.  I sure hope they were adequately compensated.  And the most annoying part was Long Island new waver Gaby Hoffman not knowing who Elvis Costello was!!  The only people in 1981 who didn't who Elvis Costello was would be your grandparents.  Oh well, you better stop smoking, it's bad for your health.",1026864000,2,1326,4.655172413793103

1041797,5,6305498903,"As I was flipping through the channel guide to see what was on TV last  night, I saw this movie was on and figured ""What the heck, it sounds  like fun.""  This movie was more than fun, it was INCREDIBLE!!!
First  there's the music.  This soundtrack should be a staple for anyone who was  around during 1981.  Given that I was a freshman in college at the time,  this music brought back many wonderful and fond memories of a time less  encumbered by responsibility.  I found myself, as well as my partner,  dancing in our chairs when another great song came on.
The story itself  was nothing less than wonderful.  Who can't relate to finding ""Mr or  Ms. Right"" for New Year's Eve?  Watching Martha Plimpton go into  nuclear meltdown because no was was showing up to her party was one of the  highlights of the movie. Her reaction to finding out what a success her  party was after passing out put her on the same level of comedic genius as  Lucy, Whoopie and Meg.  Christina Ricci was, as usual, bright, funny and  insightful as the young girl trying to find her cousins party as she and  her uptight girlfriend (Gaby Hoffman played to the extreme!) get lost in  the bowels of The Village.  Their New Yawk accents were spot on and top  drawer.
While not wanting to ignore the rest of the cast (ie Ben  Affleck, Jay Mohr and Kate Hudson)who were all excellent, the story I loved  the best was the subplot between Courtney Love and Paul Rudd.  I almost wet  my pants watching a drunken Love belt out the lyrics to ""Looking  Through the Eyes of Love"" from ""Ice Castles"" and cheered out  loud when she and Rudd finally got together.
All in all I would STRONGLY  reccomend both the movie and the soundtrack.  It will make you laugh, cry  and, in the end, you'll be happy that you spent time with these wonderful  characters as they tell their story.",965433600,4,1842,4.42942942942943
1041798,3,6305498903,"Some critics panned this movie as one of 98's worst when in fact, it's better than some of the movies that they rave over. I feel that the only reason why this movie got such a bad rap is because it had to compete with  ""The Wedding Singer"".  I didn't think that the stories stepped  over each other as bad as the Amazon editorial reviewer had stated. I  thought that it moved around smoothly and defined their characters as much  as it could. (Let me remind you that there are 12 main characters here and  the movie was only an hour and forty minutes long.)  Some critics didn't  like Christina Ricci in this one. I found her to be cute in her Jersey  accent. Also, I call Courtney Love ""the next Cher"" as she plays  her  role flawlessly. All she needs to do is to run into the right movie  and the right character, and I can see an Oscar coming her way in the  future (Madonna who? ). She and Paul Rudd had some definant on-screen  chemistry here (If you can get past Rudd's character's whining). And wasn't  Dave Chappelle's ""Disco Cabbie"" the smoothest, coolest, and  craziest player since Chef on South Park? He was the true star of this show  and it's the best I have seen him since Robin Hood: Men in Tights. The only  thing I didn't care for in this movie was the Jack and Cindy capers (Played  by Jay Mohr and Kate Hudson). Those two really didn't fit in at all with  the other characters and situations with their corny, boring and witless  presence.  They brought the mood down to a screeching halt after getting  into the high energy scenes played by the better characters.  If you need  to go get a snack or to take time off for a bathroom break, go whenever you  see the two of them on screen. Want to see Jay Mohr at his best? Rent  ""Go"". Finally, I have to say that even though this movie had  charm, great costumes, fabulous casts, funny antics, dazzling  cinematography, a great feel of nostalgia, and a grooving  soundtrack......It's one of those movies that you could only watch once.",960422400,2,2004,4.381471389645776

I could go to a  frat party and see the same thing for free. There wasn't even an hour of  the reel gone, and I was terribly bored with the constant back and forth of  party to party, listless characters and dragging scenes.
