8694690,5,B00R9O4Z9W,This show is amazingly brilliant. The character designs and the sense of humor are so endearing and you will find yourself laughing out loud through much of it. Kenshiro on a mission to buy bananas is a standout!,1442361600,,212,4.605263157894737
8694691,5,B00R9O4Z9W,"I watched a preview of this show and it made me laugh. I have been a huge fan of Fist of the North Star during my high school years. DD Fist of the North Star is so funny and a good anime show. So what happens if the nuclear war  did not start? This show happens. So, Kenshiro is not the savior and Hokuto Shinken is useless in the modern day Japan. This anime had all of the Fist of the North Star like Kenshiro, Roah, Toki, Bat, Lin, Shin, Souther. even Jagi. The Fist of the North Star characters in this show are all chibi style. Kenshiro, Toki, and Raoh are fighting over a spot for a part time job at a convince store, but they will get in certain problems and mishaps during their battles. Unlike their original counterparts the characters are a bit different than them, Ken, Raoh, Toki are slow, dimwitted, and muscle headed fighters who get in fights all the time, Lin is a ditzy, airheaded teen girl, Rei wears a pantyhose on his head, Shin walks around wearing only his cape, and Jagi is not a violent sociopath killer. If you are a fan of Fist of the North Star, buy this funny show to tickle your funny bone and I gave this show a 5 star rating.",1433376000,2,1158,4.169642857142857
