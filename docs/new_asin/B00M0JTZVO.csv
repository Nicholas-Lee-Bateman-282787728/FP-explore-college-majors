6530385,5,B00M0JTZVO,"A great family movie. The story line reveals the much-needed family value of making time to be together and learning to have fun doing it. Magic Christmas is clean, wholesome, and worth enjoying with family of all ages. Gorgeous snowy winter scenery makes this a great movie you can get comfortable with by the fire!",1417219200,7,316,4.763636363636364
6530386,2,B00M0JTZVO,This movie was borderline boring. I keep waiting for the plot to start. It had no climax what so ever. It was a family movie and it does teach on the simple things in life are the most important. But with that being said save your money and wait for it to come on TV or go to the dollar store.,1417132800,4,293,3.819672131147541

6530391,1,B00M0JTZVO,"Save your money and your time.  I lost $10 and 80 minutes on this DVD.  Says it has Closed Captioning but it did not exist.  Subtitles are in Spanish only, so we had to crank it up to hear the dialogue over the background music/effects.  The story was lame and the snarky teen girl was over-the-top, while the vapid mom was about 10-15 years too young for the role & appeared to be married to a man her father's age (C. Thomas Howell).  We weren't expecting this to be some award-winner, just a sweet, enjoyable family movie.  But it fell short of the mark for even that. I couldn't wait for it to end, balance my checkbooks while watching it to keep myself engaged in something, and suffered through to the end because I thought my 12 year old was enjoying it.  At the end, she turned and said, ""Finally!  Now can we watch something else?""",1415318400,7,840,4.339743589743589

6530438,5,B00M0JTZVO,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. One can easily relate to the characters. I love the dad's enthusiasm and wanting to bring the family closer together. While the movie doesn't talk about God, by the end of the movie you will recognize His hand. Very good family movie!",1419984000,,281,4.64
6530439,4,B00M0JTZVO,"Entertaining Christmas movie.  To Jack Carter (C. Thomas Howell), family is everything, but his family is drifting apart. To bring the closer together, Jack decides that this Christmas it's time to take the family on a much needed vacation.  Off they go to a social-media-free cabin in Farthering Pines.  What happens next is extremely funny and well worth watching.",1419984000,2,366,5.169491525423729

6530486,4,B00M0JTZVO,"Kind of a hokey movie, but teaches some good values.  Family movies are hard to come by these days.  Good family values taught here.  Should watch this and you'll good and go and do good.  I think that was the intent of the film maker.",1419206400,,235,4.155555555555556
6530487,4,B00M0JTZVO,"Great family movie, was refreshingly not cliche",1419120000,,47,5.857142857142857
6530488,4,B00M0JTZVO,"This movie is a little different.  In a way it is a Christmas romance but the romance is really between Mom and Dad, who have been happily married for years and have two teenaged kids.
  What they don't have any longer is quite the same sense of family they once had:  the kids, as they get older, are less interested in hanging around with Mom and Dad.  Dad decides they need a vacation for Christmas and he knows just the place:  a place where he used to go with his Dad many years ago -- snow, mountains, seclusion, and her daughter has to leave her cell phone at home.
  It is slower moving than some movies, but that's because it's more subtle, the story is not so black and white and the goal they seek is a little tougher to define, let alone reach.  But it's well worth a little patience and I found that I liked it as it played out, and I look forward to watching it again.",1419120000,5,882,4.141176470588236

6530491,5,B00M0JTZVO,My family loved this. Perfect for watching while snuggled on the couch together or wrapping presents. Has a very good message about how we all just need to spend time together doing the simple things in order to be happy.,1418342400,,221,4.55

8669431,2,B00M0JTZVO,"Never was mislead by good reviews like this before. I got totally busted. Low budget movies doesn't necessarily mean ""boring and poor story"", but it does in this case. The acting is barely decent, but... Where is the magic when everything is so dull and predictable? I wasted 5 bucks and 80 minutes of my time.",1489795200,,310,4.553571428571429
8669432,5,B00M0JTZVO,"I love, love, love, this Christmas movie of A Magic Christmas!  All 26 of my Grandchildren loved it also. What can I say other than get the movie,  you won't be sorry. Thank You Vicku",1456185600,,183,4.2
8669433,5,B00M0JTZVO,Great family movie with a very good message.,1451692800,,44,4.625
8669434,4,B00M0JTZVO,"Ok first things first, this is a feel good christmas movie so if you are looking for a comedy christmas look elsewhere. I will admit though this movie is not what I though it would be. This movie is great at bieng a ""feel good"" movie. I found it a little boring but that's just me. There was a point in the movie where I though it would be like cheaper by the dozen and it wasn't. When its winter and christmas is just around the corner, I want to laugh at a comedy movie like christmas vacation (all time classic) but again that's just me. This movie was hardly funny and at times it got tiresome. If you like a feel good christmas movie then look no farther, a magic christmas is your movie!! Merry christmas everyone!!",1448582400,,721,4.231884057971015

They are exciting and fun, and always have the happy ending and the love of family. All have been and remain our favorites and are watched all year long.
