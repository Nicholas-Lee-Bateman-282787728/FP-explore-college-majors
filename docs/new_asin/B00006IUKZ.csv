It will leave you wondering who and how in the world did they come up with this. Quite possibly one of the funniest shows that you will ever see. It's about this white guy who accidently gets released from a mental institution right after watching a marathon of ""SHAFT"" movies. He thinks he is a black crimefighter, and even winds up with an oriental sidekick. Its jam-packed with crazy kung-fu fighting and dubbed voices. what more could you ask for???
If you have the slightest respect for creativity you will love this show. ITS CRAZY!!!! WOAAAA!
 And make everyone who comes over watch it too. They'll be glad you did. I highly recomend and encourage not only owning a copy, but giving them out as christmas gifts. Everyone will love you, and if all goes well you might become known as the ""Shafted Man"". I'm going as John Shat for halloween. my friends are going to love it.
Happy Day

8207927,4,B00006IUKZ,"My friends and I saw this as a midnight movie in Seattle a couple of years ago, and we've been renting the video every few months. Glad to see it's finally available for sale. It's pretty funny if you're into I'm Gonna Get You Sucka, Undercover Brother, Austin Powers, etc...
A nerdy white mental patient escapes from the hospital and thinks he's Shaft. He dresses like Shaft (a black 70s crimefighter), talks like Shaft, even buys an afro to wear. He decides to be a detective like Shaft and teams up with a kung fu fighting Japanese ballerina who talks out of sync and is looking for her brother's killer. They fight a gang of Steve Martin impersonators, get chased by another group of killers (including Gary Coleman!), go to a gay bar by mistake, run into some zombies, and generally get into lots of trouble before they find the bad guy and blow up his giant pink rocket and save the world.
I guess you'd say it was a parody of 70s drive-in movies (blaxploitation, kung fu, zombie movies, etc.) and it looks about the same as those flicks. Lots of shots of the main character dressed in an afro and bell bottoms walking around downtown Los Angeles, funky music, etc. I will say some of the sets look kind of cheap, but I guess that's part of the charm...
Oh, and the main character gets mixed up and thinks his name is John SHAT, not Shaft. There you go.",1031875200,4,1359,4.418326693227091
