Yuugi must duel against him to save his grandfather! Later, Motou Yuugi gets a strange video from Pegasus J. Crawford-- the famous creator of Duel Monsters. As it turns out, Pegasus is in possession of another Millennium Item: the Millennium Eye. However, unlike Yuugi, he abuses the Games of Darkness for reasons currently unknown. He kidnaps Yuugi's grandfather and tells him that in order to save him, he must come defeat him at ""Duelist Kingdom."" Thus, the adventure of Yu-Gi-Oh: Duel Monsters has begun!

*~*~*

As for my actual review, I would have to say that the American Teenage population has completely misjudged the series. We all thought Yu-Gi-Oh was another version of Pokemon-stupid, pathetic, and a first class merchandise distributor. I was like them, for a time. That was, until I got my hands on the `original' series of Yu-Gi-Oh. The un-cut version is completely different from the Four Kids edited version. While the other one was designed to fit younger viewers, the un-cut version will surely inspire anyone who is beyond the age of twelve. This product is rated PG-13 for mild language, blood and gore, religious implications, death, some scary moments and human sacrifice. Of course, the version I currently own is the Anime Video ""AV"" series-, which has poorly manufactured subtitles and some cut-off episodes. These professional episodes are well done-however, I know very little regarding the English track. I have little faith that the English track will be any good (after seeing the actor's most recent job-the Yu-Gi-Oh Movie 2004)-but I have some hope. I am willing to give them a shot at it.",1094083200,6,2233,5.0
2143961,5,B0002Y4SKC,"Oh, this just kicks (...). For the first time, 4Kids is releasing Yu-Gi-Oh! Uncut DVDs, probably to tie in with the movie release. On the first DVD, there are three episodes: Blood-Curdling Blue-Eyes White Dragons, The Illusionist Faceless Mage's Trap, and The Lost Exodia. Yes, the episode titles are different, to match up with the Japanese version, which will ALSO BE INCLUDED ON THIS DISC (hooray!). That means I won't have to hear Weevil Underwood's screechy voice, or Joey Wheeler's New Yorker accent. In addition, these DVDs will have NO alterations from the original Japanese versions. The DVD will also be released on the same day as ""The Insector Combo"", which has three more UNCUT episodes. I suggest this disc to any Yu-Gi-Oh! fans.

Warning to Parents: These discs may contain swearing, violence, and occasionally some mild nudity.",1093478400,8,844,5.115942028985507
2144012,3,B0002Y4SKC,"I only recommend this series for older Yu Gi Oh! Fans. If you hate this series anyway the Japanese uncut version will not  impress you in the least. This statement only holds water if you already like or are somewhat interested in the storyline.

Don't buy this DVD unless you already like or are interested Yu Gi Oh!

Ignore otaku sentiment about the Japanese version being better unless you're a fan.",1110412800,,402,4.633802816901408
2144013,5,B0002Y4SKC,"When I first heard about the Yu-Gi-Oh! Uncut DVDs, I had to get them. So, I bought them from here and waited for them to come in the mail. When the package came, I ripped open the box, and opened the DVD. I put it in the DVD player and started to watch them.

The first difference I saw was the theme song. It was a japenese song. The song was better than the English Duelist Kingdom song. The second thing I saw was that the cards are in japenese. I think the cards look cooler, but it doesn't matter. Next, I noticed that the characters talk slow. They also had to fill in words. For example, when Yugi answered the phone, he said, ""Yes, hello?"" You wouldn't say that when you answer the phone. They had to fill in words to match the syllables. One more difference is the language is more harsh. There is not a lot of cursing at all. I think there was only one curse in all three episodes. Tea also said stupid, what they had to take out of the English version.

Overall, I have to give this 5 stars. It was excellent. Every die-hard Yu-Gi-Oh! fan must watch this!",1105747200,2,1066,4.169902912621359
2144014,4,B0002Y4SKC,"5,000 years ago, the fates of men and kings were decided by deadly games known as ""Yami no Game"" (aka ""The Shadow Games"").  There were seven magical items possesed by powerful sorcerors known as the Millienium Items.  One of these items, the Sennen (aka ""Millienium"") Puzzle belonged to an ancient pharoah that went by the name ""Yami"", which gave him strange and mystical powers.  Years later, the puzzle was discovered in ancient Egyptian ruins, and somehow wound up in the hands of ordinary teenage boy Mutou Yugi.

It was completely broken in pieces, and Yugi believed that if he put the puzzle together again, it would grant him his wish.  So, he wished for friends, and surprisingly, when Yugi completed the puzzle, it granted that wish through his new friends, Jonouchi, Honda, and Anzu.  But the Sennen Puzzle ended up giving Yugi more than he bargained for.  Embedded deep within the confines of the puzzle was a dark, ancient spirit that would temporarily take control over Yugi's body, and would challenge those who ""trespassed in his soul"" to  a ""Yami no Game.""  These games were very deadly and the loser would have to face a ""Pentaly Game"", which revealed the true nature of the players' souls.

Fast-forward to the present time.  Yugi and his friends have just gotten hooked on the popular Duel Monsters card game.  After defeating president of Kaiba Corp and Duel Monsters champion, Kaiba Seto, Yugi is invited to attend the Duelist Kingdom tournament, hosted by world-famous Pegasus J. Crawford, inventor of the Duel Monstes game himself.  Yugi has no choice but to accept this invitation, for Pegasus has kidnapped his grandfather, and the only way for Yugi to rescue him is to defeat Pegasus and win the tournament.  Yugi's friends tag along for the journey, and along with his best friend Jonouchi, Yugi must duel his way to the top.  All the while discovering secrets about himself and his friends that he never knew about, and learning about the secret deadly magic of the Millienium Items....

Yugioh is a popular shounen anime (cartoons for boys) that began as a humble manga (comic books) series in 1996, written and drawn by Takahashi Kazuki-san.  It was seralized in the Shounen Jump magazine and continues to to be published to this date.  The series became an instant success, spawning two anime series, dozens of merchandise, and a real-world card game.  The first Yugioh anime series, produced by Toei Animation, was first aired on Japanese television in 1996.  This series was based on the early chapters of the manga, revolving around the introduction of Yugi and his friends, and revealing how our hero solved the Sennen Puzzle.  Unfortunately, this series didn't perform very well in Japan due to its poor voice actors, bizarre animation, and lack of direction, so only 27 episodes were ever produced.

In 1998, a second Yugioh series, completely separate from the first anime was produced, entitled Yugioh: Duel Monsters.  This series was based on the later chapters of the manga, revolving around Yugi's life as a champion duelist.  This series was much more successful, running for around six seasons and over a hundred episodes.  This anime had been adapted into many different languages, with some adaptions being better than others, and some being down right awful.  And the DVD that you're looking at now contains episodes one through three of this series.  For the first time ever, uncut Yugioh is now commercially available in the U.S.  This DVD release not only contains the original Japanese version presented with English subtitles, but also contains a new, uncut English adaption.

While the subtitles on the Japanese langauge track are indeed dubtitles (closed-captions for the English dub), the new dub is so incredibly accurate to the Japanese version that this doesn't present any major problems at all.  One thing that is particulary interesting is that the new dub, while uncut and accurately-translated, continues to use the names of the characters from the English edited version, but the Japanese names are included in the subtitles.  This is just a bizarre decision, and most fans don't understand why 4Kids didn't just decide to use the Japanese names for the new dub, since they're re-dubbing the entire show, anyway.

The video and audio quality is very good, but the audio is a little lower on the Japanese language track than it is on the English language track.  Another interesting thing about these DVDs is that rather than translating the Japanese text in the credits to English like most anime companies do, 4Kids decided to leave the text in Japanese.  While this may please most Yugioh otakus, the more casual anime fan would appreciate a set of credits written in English somewhere on the disc, which seems to be completly absent here.  Also omitted from the discs are the next episode previews, which may inevitably displease many Yugioh otakus, but all they showed were clips of next week's episode, so the skipping of these previews doesn't de-tract the enjoyment of the show any.

While the new English dub is completely uncut (with the expcetion of the names), featuring all of the visual footage and original Japanese background music left entirely in-tact, the new dub still suffers from poor voice acting.  All of the familiar voice artists from the English edited version are reprising their roles here, but the acting feels even worse in the uncut dub than in the edited version because it feels like the voice artists are trying almost too hard to match the lip-movement, so it doesn't sound natural.  Luckly, the Japanese version is optional here, so Yugioh fans can enjoy the series the way it was meant to be seen.

Contrary to what Funimation is trying to tell you, the dialog and subtitles do not count as extras, and there doesn't seem to be any bonus features on these discs whatsoever, aside from some trailers for other Funimation products.  This may prove to be a dissappointment to fans expceting textless opening/ending credits or character profiles, but at least Yugioh fans have the official English subbed version licensed now.  The two biggest problems with this DVD release are the unskippable previews at the beginning of the disc, and the fact that Funimation is only releasing three episodes per volume.

While this does make the price of the individual DVDs cheaper (most uncut anime DVDs are $30 each, but the uncut Yugioh DVDs are only $20), in the end this move will make longer series like Yugioh very expensive and difficult to collect, as well as take up excessive space in many anime collector's shelves.  Overall though, this DVD release isn't as bad as one would think it is.  Yugioh fans have to remember that this is 4Kids' first attempt at releasing subbed anime.  There was a time when they wouldn't even acknowledge the fact the shows they were licensing were Japanese, let alone release subbed versions of their titles, and uncut Yugioh was once nothing more than a dream, but now that dream has been realized.

Hopefully, 4Kids will be able to improve the quality of their subbed releases in the future, but the only way they'll be able to do that is if the fans show their support for uncut anime in the U.S. by buying these DVDs.  Yugioh otakus, don't let the few errors on this DVD release discourage you from buying it because it's not as bad as you think it is.  If you've only seen the English edited version of Yugioh and have been dying to see the Japanese version, don't pass this opporunity up to own it for yourselves.

If you already own a shady subbed copy of uncut Yugioh, you should replace it with the real deal.  And if you're a casual anime fan who's been interested in Yugioh for quite some time now, but the English adaption has been discouraging you from checking it out, now is the time for you to invest in this great series.  Yugioh is an excellent anime with unique animation, great characters, and an exiciting storyline that doesn't fail to deliver, and what better way to enjoy it, than to experience it the way it was meant to be seen: uncut and unedited.  Yugioh is rated TVPG for animated violence, some strong language, adult humor, and brief nudity.",1104969600,13,8200,4.862589928057554
2144015,5,B0002Y4SKC,"yay we now get what we all wanted, uncut yugioh! it gets me thinking though, we are now paying extra for something that should have been basic.

  this is what yugioh, from the creator's (takahashi) perspective, originally was. this all changed once greedy americans got their hands on it and butchered it to hell and felt like they would make a bigger profit out of it by focusing it on to little elementary kids. its creates crap unimaginable for an anime fun, like myself. i have watched several japanese episodes of yugioh before it was americanized and i can say as an anime fan that it has everything needed for a good anime.  everyone may be saying this isn't true, but you also may be judging it with the *cough cough* american 4kids version.

  some things that i have come across that have been butchered is the fact that some cards are edited due to the fact that the art is actually EGYPTIAN. isn't that what the show is about? for example, resurrection (monster reborn) is supposed to be an ankh but its replaced by some dumb sword looking thing. i may be going off topic, but still, it give you an idea about how much the americans screwed this whole series over (oh and by the way, im part azn).

  also, you people shouldnt be complaining about the dialogue, just watch it subbed, ive gotten used to it, trust me, and at the same time, you're learning a new language. another thing you guys are complaining about is the ""change"" in storyline. if anything was a change, it would have to be the stuff on kids wb, remember this is the original stuff in this dvd so people should now be judging the series and its ""changes"" according to this line of dvds.

  all in all, this first dvd only has one flaw, the amount of episodes, which i hope they will work on in the upcoming volumes.",1103155200,,1796,4.422492401215806
2144016,4,B0002Y4SKC,"At my house, we only have basic cable for our TV, so I could not get the WB on my vieweing list. So I did not get a chance to first experience Yu-Gi-Oh! until it aired in November 2002 on Cartoon Network. Needless to say, I loved it. I loved the characters, I loved the game involved, and I loved the Egyptian theme to it all. I was one satisfied 14-year old.

About a year later, however, I learend that many things had been cut or changed in the show to make it appropriate for kids to watch. The original version has a lot more religious references, actual cussing, sexual references and partial monster nudity and violence. For example, in the original version of ""First Fight"", the Harpie Lady was wearing nothing but spandex pants, and two strips of purple cloth over its chest. For the US version, they fully covered the monster so that it was now wearing an actual shirt. This was a fully reasonable change, as partial nudity would not have sat well with parents.

Unfortunately, not all of the changes (in my opinion) were as reasonable as the one meantioned above. Another change that was made was the removal of guns from all parts of the show. Unfortunately, this left anyone carrying one with the appearance of pointing his/her finger threatingly at another person. I could go on, literally, for days about my other complaints, but for the sake of this review, I won't.

The point is, the version of Yu-Gi-Oh! that was released on the airwaves left a lot to be desired. And, apparently, 4KIDS has now heeded the thousands of complaints, and released the first six episodes completely unedited. No more finger pointing,  friendship speeches that have been toned down in the cringe level, and the like. So, when I got this DVD in the mail, I had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, like almost all high expectatations, mine were bound to come back to haunt me.

One of the main advertisements for these DVD's was that the English dub track was going to be completely redone, so that it would now be a perfect match for the Japanese dialog. This excited me a great deal, as I have always been a big believer in well-done dubs, and have always protested about the horrible ones. Unfortunately, this was soon brought crashing down in my mind.

For starters, the dub is NOT completely accurate. They still use the English names, like Joey instead of Jounouchi, and Tea instead of Anzu. But I can forgive them for this, as the show IS still meant for pre-teens. The only thing I could not forgive 4KIDS for is the job that the English voice actors did for the new dialog. The English lines have been greatly slowed down, as if the actor has a stutter, and is trying to mouth every word out clearly. This, apparently, was done so that the new dialog would match the lip movements. It comes across as very cheesy. For a company that has such a great editing department (I mean, look at all the editing they did to the TV version! You couldn't even tell if you didn't already know!) would be able to change the lip movements to match the dialog. I mean, really, I had to switch to the Japanese dialog after a few minutes.

Also, the DVD is very much lacking in the bonus features department. The only features left to be seen on this DVD were audio options, and the previews included. We could have seen a little more in that department.

My final thoughts: Any fans out there who love Yu-Gi-Oh! will love this DVD because of the fact that it has the original music, the original Japanese audio, yadda yadda. But those fans who are fans of the English actors may be a little disappointed.

DVD RATING: 7/10",1100822400,5,3607,4.519938650306749
2144017,5,B0002Y4SKC,"I am a broke teenager who can't afford to pay $20 for 3 eps of a 224 anime series. So, I bought a VCD set of the original Toei Series, a boot set of eps 1-120 of YGO: DM, and downloaded the new GX eps.

Since I have only the japanese version, I can't rate the new dub, but here goes.

The uncut is like a different show. It is much better, and the dialogue covers so much more than the 4Kids version. It contains more violence, swearing, etc., but that's not why it's better. It's the dialogue. The dialoge is SO much different that if you compare them it really is like watching a different show.

2144049,4,B0002Y4SKC,"I was confused by this release at first when I discovered that the english dialogue was exactly the same as the japanese subtitles.  But, apparently they re-dubbed it for the uncut release. I do have a couple of nitpicks, though.  First, the timing of the subtitles is off quite often.  The subtitles will end before the character stops speaking.  Also, and it might be related to what I just wrote, but there's a scene where Yugi is saying something, but there aren't any subtitles.  Mai says something after she beats the no-name duelist, but again, no subtitles. Secondly, I would prefer if they translated the monster names.  It's a little disconcerting to hear, for instance, Kaiba say ""Cyclops"", but to see ""Hitotsu-me Giant"" in the subtitles. Here's hoping they release the ORIGINAL first season, currently only available in Japan.",1099785600,2,838,4.9928057553956835
2144050,4,B0002Y4SKC,"I was so looking forward to the 2 uncut DVD's that I was bound to be a LITTLE disappointed.  While the slightly different take on the plot from the 4Kids version was in some ways great, I missed the stupid banter from Joey a bit (this is a little more serious than the 4Kids).  Also, Mai's voice in the English Dub is not the same as in the 4Kids.  However, having said this, with the slight differences in plot and the more accurate translation, some character actions & the motivations of the characters do make a little more sense.  I am a bigger fan of the Battle City Duels than the Duellist Kingdom Duels so I suppose I was never going to be completely happy.  While listening to the original music & sound effects was great (especially the sound effects) I still prefer the 4Kids for the music, it just seems much more upbeat.  I would only give one recommendation, to add the 4Kids dub as well as the english dub already on the DVD.  That way, those who prefer the 4Kids translation can watch it with the original visual format, (& maybe even the original sound effects & music).  I would recommend this & the second Uncut DVD to any real fan of Yu-Gi-Oh as it is really enjoyable to watch & it is also interesting to note the differences from the 4Kids.  The slightly different plot may not suit everyone though.  The first 2 Uncut DVD's didn't really have anything in it (in my opinion) that could be called violent/gory/religious etc.  I hope they continue to bring out the Uncut for the whole first season & then start on the next.  I also hope that the complete Battle City Duels DVD comes out in a boxed set like the first season is.  These DVD's are definitely worth a look.  I think you'll know if you like it better than the 4Kids before the first episode is over.",1098835200,,1781,4.37386018237082
2144051,5,B0002Y4SKC,"This is what quite a few Yu-Gi-Oh fans have been waiting for...oh say...over a year.  Hopefully to be the first of many more to come, this DVD comains the first three episodes of the Yu-Gi-Oh:  Duel Monsters series CORRECTLY TRANSLATED!!  Not the junk they've been showing on television.

It contains both English and Japanese audio tracks with the original musical score (not that dub junk).  They've compleatly re-done these episodes to give the show its actual original plot.  It even has the Japanese opening and closing themes in both versions (not translated, but subbed), and even the small animation when the show cuts to commercials on TV (for those who know the original, the 3-d Puzzle rotating with hyrogliphes in the background).

As stated before in the previous reviews, they still have the American names for the charactors and cards in the English version (though they keept Grandpa's name Sugoroku), but they did change the some of the monster's attack names, such as Black Magic for the Black (Dark) Magician and Burst Stream of Destruction for the Blue-Eyes (and not Grandma's old White Lighting).  I have not seen the Insector Combo DVD yet, but I'm sure now they've finally aknowleged that they (the main charactors) are in Japan (Weevil and Rex are said to be from East and West Japan, not to mention Pegasus comments to Yugi, ""In your language..."" meaning Yugi is not from America).

2144053,5,B0002Y4SKC,"This is the original uncut Japanese version of the show. In turn all the episodes are in subtitlesbut this allows for the original Japanese voiceovers to do there job. Besides the fact that it is in Japanese other differences between this and its American conterpart include the character names, card names, dialoge, and the violence/gore level. The character names are all different they were changed in the American version to apeal to the audience. The card names are mostly basic differences because of the transilation from Japanese to Chinese then to English. Two examples are Green eyes white dragon instead of Blue eyes white dragon, also the Dark magician was named Black sorceror. The english dialoge is 90% different then th original Japanese. This was done to make it geared to a yonger audience. These differeneces include simple things like in the American Yugi would say to Joey ""Your going to win"" the japanese says ""You better not lose"". The most noticable diffrence is the violence and gore. In the American version blood and gore is totaly absent but in the japanese it is quite prevelent for instance one scene totaly redone for the American version was When Marik sent his parents to the shadow realm. The original shows him stabing his parents with millennium rod. The uncut versions gore and violence makes this inapropriat for some of the original American audience specifically the young ones. The diffeneces form the Japaneese to the American in turn change the show so drastically that the general audience who will buy this changes. These changes in my eyes make the show much better and buying it here will save you some money because from what i have noticed is that anime is generally more expensive than other movies, but that also might be my bad luck.

Funimation is doing us all a great service by releasing a DVD with an UNCUT JAPANESE version of each episode! So the subtitles are a little shakey - so what?! If that REALLY bothers you, go learn Japanese and move to Japan! Then you won't have to deal with the few errors these wonderful people who work hard to give us an actual representation of the dialogue make! Another dumb complaint: ""some of the boys are voiced by Japanese women"" - I'm sorry, but you're further out of the loop than I am if you think this is ""bad"". Yugi is a short kid - a little kid, if you will. All little kids who haven't hit puberty yet sound like girls so the Japanese voice the majority of little boys with girls. Oh darn.
Personally, I'll buy these DVDs with my last pennies if it means that I get to hear the ORIGINAL JAPANESE voices of Yugi, Bakura Ryo, and Malik (or Marik, whatever). I'm really tired of hearing Yami no Marik sound like a constipated old man (although I'm quite fond of Bakura's British accent in the dubs =3).
Oh, and Harpie Lady's attire? Oh darn - blue cartoon boobies!! Jeeze, some people...
Ah, the ""guns"" in the dubs - ""I'm gonna poke you!!"" Please... I'm gouging my eyes out...
Oh, I don't think a lot of people know this - the Millenium Rod of Marik's? It holds a nifty little blade that HE STABS HIS FATHER WITH. No Shadow Realm for him =3 Bwee~
Okay, I've thrown in my two cents ^-^ Now you may start hating me =3 I still want my Mariku-chan X3

[EDIT] BTW, if you want bad subtitles, try watching Hong Kong bootlegs XD They had Seto as ""Zither"" for a few episodes - and he's not the only one who got screwed in the translations.",1121990400,10,2019,4.230569948186528
8034706,4,B0002Y4SKC,"I am thrilled that 4Kids Entertainment is releasing something uncut and bilingual.  But I wish they wouldn't be so stingy as to give us only 3 episodes and play an ad when the DVD loads that cannot be skipped using Next, Menu, or even Fast Forward.  As for the quality of the show itself, I would recommend watching the dub on TV and pursuing the subtitled version if it catches your interest.",1116115200,,393,4.444444444444445
