The title within this colorful collection are: A Baroque Odyssey, Allegria, Cirque Reinvente, Dralion, Journey of Man, La Magie Continue, Nouvelle Experience, Quidam, Saltimbanco, Varekai, La Nouba.

$100+ bucks for these 12 dvds is definitely a bargain.",1130803200,109,492,5.833333333333333
2420856,5,B000BK4CBW,Perfect for our use. Just as described.,1408492800,,39,4.714285714285714
2420857,5,B000BK4CBW,Cirque Du Soleil is so unique and talented they just amaze me.  I am so glad that I bought this and all my friends have been borrowing them.,1396828800,,140,4.0
2420858,3,B000BK4CBW,"It's a family oriented circus act, but it can be so dark and suggestive of malevolence at times that it scares kids. PG 13 at best.",1394928000,,131,4.076923076923077
2420859,3,B000BK4CBW,"I love Cirque Du Soleil, and I have only watch 2 of the DVDs. But what I have watch, 1 early and 1 newer show, is sadly lacking. Not what I am use to with Cirque Du Soleil. I am hopping they get better and I may come back and rate this higher if they do! for now it's just 3 stars!",1388966400,,281,3.5483870967741935
2420860,1,B000BK4CBW,"I'm a big fan of Cirque du Soleil, so I hate to leave a bad review. I'm sure this collection is amazing, but after purchasing this collection on instant view, I'm saddened to realize that what I actually bought was ONE 38 minute long video, and NOT the collection. Definitely not worth the $10. I could have bought the DVD for less. True, this was the first time I'd ever purchased an instant view title, and I see now that it says ""Journey of Man"" (the movie that you ACTUALLY get), but I'm a long-time amazon user and like every other order I've ever placed (with no problems), I expected to get the item that I'm looking at, not something else.

In short, just be aware that if you buy this collection for instant view, you're just getting a 38 minute video, NOT the 12 disc collection that the listing is for. LAME.",1355270400,4,819,4.352941176470588
2420861,4,B000BK4CBW,"This collection is good, has the most of the videos and some of them are very good, are videos that cannot miss in your house, but it would be excellent if it included the special shows.",1353456000,,186,4.194444444444445
2420862,4,B000BK4CBW,I bought this for my parents thirtieth wedding anniversary along with a few other gifts and they loved it. They like to go see them when they come to town and so I figured they might like this. I had to sit through some of the old ones which don't have nearly the same sense of awe as the newer shows but still are impressive in their own way. I would suggest it for a fan or for a gift for a fan.,1328659200,,397,3.7951807228915664
2420863,5,B000BK4CBW,"What more can be said about Cirque Du Soleil than ""spectacular?"" The fine mesh of artistry, music, imagination, athleticism, dance, conceptualization . . . just not enough adjectives in the language to describe even one Cirque performance no less a collection. I've attended a couple of live performances that were, likewise, a sensory extravaganza. But one factor taints a live performance: there is absolutely no way your eyes and ears can appreciate EVERYTHING that is going on around the whole stage. You would have to attend multiple performances of the same show to take EVERYTHING in since a CdS show has every visible performer performing 100% of the time adding to the emotion of the show. At least with a recorded medium with multiple camera angles, cutaways and bonus footage of what goes on offstage, only then can you fully appreciate the artistry, dedication, hard work and creativity of the most entertaining show(s) in the history of theater, music and athletic performance! Have a bad day? Pop in a Cirque DVD, recline and the world goes away for at least 90 minutes. Buy at least one CdS DVD or enter heaven with the entire collection.",1279497600,,1153,4.917948717948718
2420864,3,B000BK4CBW,"5 stars for Cirque Du Soleil but the quality of some of the DVDs in this set is so disappointing that I stopped watching many older ones. As another post states; ""The early shows are almost unwatchable because the video quality is so poor. The content is really dated too. The music, costumes and acts are nothing like the modern shows. Starting with Drallion (1999) things got much better""

The newer DVDs are much better but with the overall DVD set experience, I will only by them in Bluray going forward.",1279324800,3,508,4.582417582417582
2420865,5,B000BK4CBW,"The collection of this boxset is filled with wonders from all around. I love the way each dvd holds a magical part within it. Love watching each one of these it holds a wonderful place within my heart for the people that work so hard to put on the shows each night & always gives others the feeling of joy & love. I was very happy to buy this set of 11 dvd's of the wonderful acts & magaical ways that Cirque always brings a place for hope, love & peace in my life & others...........
On with the show :)",1268006400,,504,4.0

2420867,4,B000BK4CBW,"This is a big collection of Cirque du Soleil shows. It is not complete though and is missing some shows from the years listed.

There are a number of shows that were done very early on and are not full of the pomp and circumstance of their newer shows but it is interesting to see the progression nonetheless. Some of the shows are not as interesting and we ended up not watching the whole thing.

My kids love watching them but after one or two viewings of a particular show they have had enough.

We had tickets to see Alegria so we specifically did not watch that DVD. After the show (which was great) we watched and even though the recording of Alegria was over 14 years ago, the performances were almost identical. It was like having a souvenir of the show to remember our experience.

I purchased mine during a Gold Box deal and it was a little easier on the wallet. It is a great set for Cirque fans but maybe purchasing an individual show might be better if you have a favorite.",1260403200,5,986,4.313513513513514
2420868,5,B000BK4CBW,"Beautifully photographed and edited Cirque Du Soliel performances. A must have set for any home entertainment collection. With an HD TV, it is an overwhelming experience.  Different from being there personally, but equally as enthralling.",1254528000,,238,5.8
2420869,5,B000BK4CBW,Wonderful set for family viewing or to give as a gift!  Would definitely recommend!,1254096000,,83,4.928571428571429
2420870,5,B000BK4CBW,"This collection is so stunning. From the early more ""simple concepts"" to the later ""world of dreams circus"" I am so pleased with the content. If you have kids interested in the arts, or just jumping around, they can learn and grow from watching these dvd's. The costumes are so creative. The stories mysterious and enchanting, thats if you are a deep thinker...otherwise there are giggles and gasps in every performance. Plenty of adventure for every age and intellect.",1252800000,2,469,4.949367088607595
2420871,5,B000BK4CBW,A great collection of Cirque Du Soleil's achievements. You'll be glad you bought it!! Many hours of viewing pleasure!,1252368000,,117,5.2105263157894735
2420872,4,B000BK4CBW,I bought this item about 3 months ago from Amazon for 120.00  It is now selling for 130.00.  For this price you get 11 DVD plus a bonus DVD.  The first DVD is called LA Magie Continue.  This DVD I would rate 3 stars not enoungh acts and not long enough. Next DVD is Cirque Reinvente this DVD is absoultly fabulous I give it a 5 star rating. The third DVD is called Nouvelle Experience absolutely 5 stars wonderful DVD. Forth DVD Saltimbanco great fun to watch 5 stars I would rate it. Fifth DVD Allegria absolutely wonderful 5 stars. Six DVD A Baroque Odysssey awful DVD I rate it 2 stars.  This DVD number 6 was the worst DVD I have seen in a really long time. Seventh DVD LA Nouba absolutly wonderful 5 stars.  Eight DVD called Journey Of Man way to short give rating of 3 stars.  The eighth DVD is very different and is only 39 minutes long. Ninth DVD called Quidam is absoultly fabulous 5 stars. Tenth DVD Dralion is very good DVD but not amazing 4.5 stars I would rate it.  The Eleven DVD Varekial is way to long and has to many acts that are just time fillers.  However some of the acts are wonderful though but not enough of them.  It is a time passing DVD Varekal I would rate it 3.5 stars.  The bonus DVD is called Midnight Sun.  I have not watched it yet but all ready determined that the product deserves 4 stars instead of 5.  Hope this review helps you in your buying decision.,1251417600,8,1390,4.180451127819549
2420873,5,B000BK4CBW,"I am so pleased with the collection.  Out of 12 discs, there may be 2 that didn't have me totally mesmorized.  I am a big fan of cirque and I didn't get disappointed with the set.  I will share with friends and family.  I recommend this purchase to anyone who is a cirque fan or anyone interested in viewing amazing, very talented people.",1228176000,7,338,4.317460317460317
2420874,3,B000BK4CBW,"I have to say that this set is in short terms one half good and one half not so good. It is good in the start and moving on.....then slowly starts to stray away from the Cirque we all love......the worst in MY opinion was the last one (a one-time performance...luckily)""Midnight Sun"" ACK!!! There were no costume efforts, and there were no acts or performances we are used to. Just a cheap show for the International Jazz Festival. Now granted...these performers can perform WAY better than myself...not taking anything away from them...but when you are used to the extraordinary...the simple does not cut it. I felt the performances should IMPROVE...not evaporate.",1213401600,13,665,5.0

Ademas contiene un dvd titulado una odisea barroca donde explica todo el trayecto del cirque du soleil. Entre otros temas se encuentra dralion una presentacin que tiene una gran influencia oriental en sus actos, varekai, alegria, saltimbanco, entre otros, adicional obsequian 6 tarjetas con la fotos de la presentacin de los dvd.

2420877,5,B000BK4CBW,"I love this DVD set, and the fact that it contains the nearly complete set is fantastic. The first two DVD's (""La Magie Continue"" and ""Cirque Reinvente"")are much more like your average circus, but the ""Nouvelle Experience"", and all the rest (Except for ""A Baroque Odyssey"" and ""Midnoght Sun"") are the trademark Cirque shows. The only thing that could make this set better is ""Corteo."" Most definitly worth the $100+.",1187308800,15,416,4.957142857142857

When we popped in the first DVD we thought we would be bored by the original ""traditional"" circus acts they started out with, BUT we were laughing and loving every second of it. To see how they grew is just a couple years the next and every DVD only get better and better.

I will be purchasing these sets for several family members over the years I am sure. It is an amazing collection.",1167868800,23,538,4.326732673267327

I was so thrilled! My husband immediatly opened it and watched the La Noubia (sp?) again and loved it as much on DVD as he did live. I would recommend this set to anyone who appreciates this type of show!! Definatley a 5 star (and considering we paid $398 for 4 tickets to see ONE show live, definately a great deal!!)",1167091200,9,493,4.25531914893617
