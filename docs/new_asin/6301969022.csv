BTW, I just finished reading the play and it is very close to the movie - the big difference being the play starts at the Hotel Monte Gabriele with no other preamble.",1199059200,4,332,4.370967741935484
388775,3,6301969022,"When playwright Robert Sherwood wrote IDIOT'S DELIGHT for the stage, it was a huge hit on Broadway.  Normally when this happens, Hollywood inevitably follows with a screen version.  Under director Clarence Brown, the staginess of Broadway was unfortunately retained so that even the star power of Clark Gable (Harry Van) and Norma Shearer (Irene Fellara) was not enough to make this a memorable pairing.

The problem with IDIOT'S DELIGHT does not reside in the stagy feeling leaping off the screen.  Rather, Norma Shearer as Irene plays two totally different characters that she tries hard to keep distinct, even though the audience (and her love lead Gable) knows quite well that they are the same.  Norma as Irene is an acrobat who falls heavily for Gable as Harry.  She tells him that they would make a good pair in his mind reading act.  Harry disagrees even though he makes it plain that he loves her too.  They separate and reunite ten years later at an Alpine resort somewhere in Europe.  Part of the problem with the audience's identification with both plot, theme, and character is the overly brief way director Brown handles the decade long separation.  Brown presents an unconvincing and dull montage of newspaper headlines that shout out the major events of the 30s.  When Harry and Irene do meet at that Alpine hotel, Harry has not changed--he still is a dancing hoofer, this time the leader of an all girl troupe, Les Blondes.  Irene has morphed into a blonde wigged Russian accented aristocrat who is the companion of a heartless munitions manufacturer.  As Irene speaks in the broadest Russian accent imaginable, the audience soon wearies of her over the top verbal antics.  By the end of the film, Irene reverts to her normal mode of speaking as she and Harry unite in a forced happy ending.  It is this forced ending that also grates on the audience's willing suspension of disbelief. Director Brown actually shot two different endings, a European version that ended with a patriotic song of defiance and one for the American moviegoer that ended is a honky tonk rendition of the Jazz Age.  As I watched both endings, I could see that the tragic undertones of a then looming war (the movie was shot before Hitler attacked Poland in 1939), overlaid the purported theme of delayed romance to such an extent that the audience did not know quite how to react to the finale of Harry and Irene singing as bombs burst all around them. Still, IDIOT'S DELIGHT is worth the viewing in that it acts as a dramatic counterpoint of irony when the munitions manufacturer boasts of the need for his product that will within a matter of months wreck the world. Gable and Shearer make this counterpoint bearable as their delayed love recovers its direction even as the rest of a mad world loses its own.",1118448000,4,2803,4.784232365145228
388776,4,6301969022,"I have been watching a number of Clark Gable movies of late.  He was featured the other month on Turner Classic Movies and I thought it would be interesting some of his ""other"" movies.  I learned a lot about how Hollywood could make a mediocre movie with a good cast.  However, I also saw some pretty interesting movies I never would have seen if I hadn't looking for Gable movies.  I sat down to watch ""Idiot's Delight"" fully prepared to see another turkey.  However, as the movie started to unfold, I realized that this was a notch above the others.  The first clue was an excellent scene in which returning wounded soldiers from WWI were delayed from reaching the hospital because of the crowds watching a parade of marching soldiers.

The movie moves along in some interesting paths and Gable is front and center the whole way.  He does a pretty good job, too.  The story eventually find a mixed group of people gathered together at a hotel in the mountains somewhere near Switzerland (I said it moved in interesting paths).  There we get a crash course on the evils of war; especially the anticipated war that was threatening to break out in Europe when this movie was made.  It was a bit heavy on pacifism which was ironic to future audiences who knew that only war could stop a madman like Hitler.  In fact, postponing the eventual confrontation only served to extend the eventual killing and suffering.  However, this was writer Robert Sherwood's plea for an end to all wars.  Sherwood provided a strong script for this impressive cast.  However, some of the actors weren't quite up to the task.  The biggest disappointment to me was Norma Shearer.  She started out well but then took on a different charater and completely overdid it.  If she had just emoted less and carried a milder accent, things would have turned out better.  Aviation enthusiasts will wonder at a military air base in a valley surrounded by mountains.  The ending was somewhat odd but Turner Classic Movies presented both the European and American audience endings.  The one for the Europeans was pointedly pessimistic ending with a chorus of ""Abide with me"".  The American version almost seems to end like there'll be a sequel on the Riviera.

All in all, I was fairly impressed with ""Idiot's Delight"".  The dialogue is better than most movies made these days so it might be worth a look on the Late Late Show.",1111104000,4,2392,4.694711538461538
388777,4,6301969022,"Not a movie I would recommend for most people, I personally will watch it anytime it is on. I prefer the stage, so that is probably why. Idiot's delight is a movie to be appriciated for it's unusualness, namely Clark Gable singing, and Norma Shearer in a blond wig singing in Russian. Had a very stagy feel I enjoyed. Also Norma Shearer's con artist character was charming, especially ""O-ma-haha I have never been there"" type comments. Was a little over dramatic at moments but I believe it was trying to make a very serious point. Many scences I throughly enjoyed, a fun ride over all.",1104969600,4,586,4.59047619047619
388778,3,6301969022,"Robert E. Sherwood's Pulitzer Prize-winning IDIOT'S DELIGHT was one of the great play of Broadway's ""golden age of drama"" in the 1930s: starring stage greats Lunt and Fontanne, it told a darkly comic tale of a group of people staying at an Alpine hotel--including small-time nightclub performer Harry Van and con-artist and sometime entertainer Irene, the latter passing herself off as a Russian of noble birth--whose largely shallow lives create a ridiculous and often disturbing counterpoint to the world as it edges toward war.

Unfortunately, and although it is fairly faithful the the stage original, the screen version of IDIOT'S DELIGHT is nothing to write home about, and not even starpower saves it; indeed, it proved one of Gable or Shearer's few box office failures.  There are several reasons for this, but the overall problem is that the production has the feel of a filmed stage play rather than of a movie; director Clarence Brown fails to endow the production with anything approaching a cinematic quality.  The cast is also problematic.  Although he delivers a surprisingly effective song-and-dance turn with ""Puttin' on the Ritz""--the only musical number he ever performed on screen--Gable is essentially miscast as Harry Van; Norma Shearer, almost unrecognizable in a blonde wig, is relentlessly over the top in her performance as the fake countess; and even the usually reliable Burgess Meredith (along with most of the supporting cast) seems overblown and stagey, as if he were playing to the balcony instead of the camera.

But in spite of these significant drawbacks, the disturbing nature of Sherwood's story still packs enough of a punch for us to recognize how powerful the material itself is, and the vision of fools dancing recklessly on the edge of war has clear resonation today.  Still, unless you are die-hard Gable or Shearer fan, you might prefer to catch this one on the late-late show instead of purchasing the expensive and out-of-print tape.

Crews is so drunk that she confuses the ""tips"" Gable gives her and mixes up her answers so that she and Gable are booed offstage, especially when ingenue Shearer, waiting in the wings, cues the drunken medium so loudly that the audience hears it.

388828,3,6301969022,"""Idiot's Delight"" (1939)
(mild spoilers below)

American anxieties about the impending world war color this 1939 musical melodrama. Clark Gable is cast against type in a role that's equal parts Fred Astaire and Humphrey Bogart.  An American song-and-dance man working abroad, he meets the woman who stole his heart years ago, played (rather stiffly) by Norma Shearer, posing as a European socialite who has hooked a sugardaddy industrialist who takes her to the grand hotel where Gable and his vaudeville troupe have landed.

The hotel is on the border of two feuding Alpine nations, and also near a secret air base packed with Art Deco bomber planes, which are constantly on drill as international tensions mount. The exact details of the political problems are left purposefully vague, and there seems to be an effort to look at the prospect of war evenhandedly -- a tragedy for all, with blame only on thoughtless politicians and war profiteers, rather than on the real-life Nazi scourge that many Americans were still trying to avoid directly confronting. Anyway, Gable Shearer and the others are caught in the path of inevitable war, and though stagey and outlandish, the closing scenes of mayhem and destruction are a real warning of what was to come. In dramatic terms, this feels a lot like a stage play that was put to film with minimal alterations, but it still works as a 'Thirties potboiler.  One highlight is Gable's ""Puttin' On The Ritz"" dance number which isn't quite Astaire quality, but still has an iconic '30s feel to it. Worth checking out - a 3.5 perhaps?

388851,4,6301969022,"- Harry Van (clears his throat): ""Excuse me, madam, but it seems to me the last time you told me of your escape, it was different.""
- Countess Irena, spinning yarns: ""Well, I made several escapes.""

IDIOT'S DELIGHT is hard to pin down, with regards to its overall tone. I guess, mostly, it's a comedy until the final fifteen minutes or so, and then it segues into melodrama. And depending on whether you've seen the international version or the domestic one, the closing moments generate an anti-war sentiment that either comes off as heartfelt or almost incidental. Of course, when I first saw this as a kid, all that heavy stuff sailed over my head. This film is best known for Clark Gable's one and only stab at a song & dance number (""Puttin' on the Ritz""). Astaire's not fretting.

Clark Gable plays hoofer and World War I veteran Harry Van who in the post-war era struggles to land a gig in vaudeville. In Omaha he spends a romantic evening with a peculiar stage acrobat named Irene (Shearer), and never mind that their first encounter originates from Irene's inadvertent sabotage of his mind-reading act. Harry is quite taken with Irene, not that he'd show it. Irene is a self-styled student of life and a grand liar. She regales Harry with flights of fancy so sweeping even Walter Mitty is calling bu11sh--. Later, maybe the next day, they part ways at a train station.

Many years later, maybe twenty years later, and Harry Van is touring the night clubs of Europe with his latest act, six song & dance sweethearts called Les Blondes. They're on a train ride from Romania to Switzerland when war is declared and the Genevan border is promptly closed off, stranding Harry and the girls behind enemy lines and forcing them to check in at a local Alpine hotel. In the hotel lobby, Harry is gobsmacked to glimpse a Russian countess who bears a striking resemblance to his old flame, Irene from Omaha. Harry takes in her platinum blonde tresses and her pronounced Russian accent and her airy ways and isn't buying it. Me, when I first saw the movie, it had me wondering whether the countess was actually a countess or a brilliant fake.

It's hoped that you pardon that dated feel, that you instead focus on the interesting period elements. Shearer's take on the Russian countess is so exaggerated, it borders on caricature. So there's that to nitpick. Conversely, I really liked her turn as the dreamy-eyed American girl Irene. Clark Gable plays Clark Gable to the hilt, swaggerful and virile. But notice how, whenever the Russian countess whom he believes is a fraud is in the room, he parks a perpetually skeptical expression on his mug. He just ain't buying what she's selling. His smirk makes me smile.

Will the countess maintain her charade? Or is she the real deal? We do find out just in time for the bombs to drop and for her and Harry Van to scramble for cover (worry not, the six cute Les Blondes got out in time). Like Hitchcock's FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT and a few other films, IDIOT'S DELIGHT does deserve credit for attempting to shed a light on the spectre of war then hovering over Europe. MGM shot two alternate endings. The international one features Gable and Shearer singing a spiritual hymn over a piano during the air raid. The domestic ending has Harry teaching the countess the code behind his old mind-reading act even as bombs detonate outside their window (an impressive special effects backdrop, by the way). This finale may not resonate as strongly as the international version, especially for viewers overseas. It's okay. The countess had already done her job, having earlier denounced the munitions magnate (or war merchant, if you like) with whom she was keeping company. The munitions man (Edward Arnold) didn't like what she had to say and so abandons her, leaving an opening for Harry the Hoofer to step in for a bit of rescue. For what it's worth, even though Shearer's condemnation of her escort comes off heavy-handed, it's still miles more graceful than Burgess Meredith's belligerent, jingoistic approach. It's okay to wave the flag with vigor, just don't poke out the eye of the guy marching next to you.",1351036800,,4147,4.754166666666666
388852,5,6301969022,"I loved this movie after the second time I watched it,Gable was great as a song and dance man.
And Norma Shearer's phony Russian countess is fantastic,this performance really stands out in a great career,her Russian accent is really funny and spellbinding at the same time.",1334707200,2,273,4.956521739130435
388853,2,6301969022,"Clark Gable was one of those actors who I never really `got'.  I mean, he had some stellar performances (`It Happened One Night' and `The Misfits' come instantly to mind) but for the most part I find him rather overrated.  Especially in `Gone With the Wind', where he is often lauded as the manliest of men and the epitome of the `ACTOR'...I just find that performance generic.  I happened to watch `Idiot's Delight' the other night, a film that was released the same year as `Gone With the Wind', and I must say that Gable captured a spark I don't often associate with him.

Let's get this out of the way first; the film itself is borderline terrible, but Gable is rather sensational.

The film follows Harry Van, a song and dance man who makes a living deceiving audiences with his charm and keen sense of timing.  While working in Omaha with an act involving an overweight, drunk faux-psychic, Van meets Irene, an acrobat with a longing for something more.  She tries to persuade Van to dump the drunk and take her on for his act.  That doesn't quite pan out and the pair part only to find themselves thrust together on the Swiss border on the cuffs of World War II.  Irene has donned the disguise of a Russian aristocrat and denies any and all knowledge of Omaha.  Forced to keep company thanks to circumstances out of their control, Van attempts to `out' Irene.

The film, for me, is too unfocused.  I know that it is based on an award winning play, but the concept just doesn't seem to translate well on the screen.  The comedic affectations put on by the two stars don't compliment the seriousness of the films core.  The emphasis on the war is too strong to support a comedic film, so either the war themes should have been diverted or underplayed or the tone of the film should have been of a more serious nature.

That, and Norma Shearer's performance is embarrassing.  What she does is borderline ridiculous.  In fact, it is ridiculous.  I know that she is playing a phony and thus her accent work should be regarded as such, but she is so preposterous in her every action that her character becomes an annoyance.  She isn't funny.  Clark Gable on the other hand really knocks this one out of the part.  He reminded me of that charming fire I saw in `It Happened One Night'.  His take on `The Ritz' is sensational.  He croons, he moves, he charms the pants off the audience and he does it all with an intensity and a realism that defies the film's conflicted focus.

Not saying he deserved an Oscar nomination, but this would have made a better nomination than his `Gone With the Wind' nom.

For me, the film's conclusion is also a big mistake.  I had the opportunity to see both endings shot for the film, the domestic and international, and neither really do anything to enhance the film's direction.  Instead, they blow off the wartime backdrop (which is far more than a backdrop) for comedic or romantic romps that undermine the apparent intentions of the film.  Both endings are messy in different ways, and in a way show a lack of respect for the seriousness of the themes.

I just wish that this film knew what it wanted to be.",1303257600,3,3145,4.507067137809187
388854,3,6301969022,"It's great that It's available at all. They should have included the alternate ending to this movie. TCM showed both endings last time I saw It, and It was really a great insight to what the people who were releasing the movie, wanted you to see.
  Two different ways of looking at the same situation. Maybe they'll include It with the next edition.",1295308800,,349,4.523809523809524
388855,4,6301969022,"more charm than any man should be allowed. From his self-effacing grin, clipped moustache, dimples, and broooad shoulders he is the compleat movie star. Although not known for his dancing skills, he looks smart dancing to ""Puttin' on the Ritz,"" with his bevy of blonde show girls (watch for Virgina Grey, Gable's long time on again off again girlfriend, as the most elegant of Les Blondes). Gable has a great match in leading lady Norma Shearer. She is always in character whether an acrobat from Omaha, or a Russian countess who escaped the ""Bolsheviki"" by the skin of her teeth in a variety of scenarios.

The script is an interesting take on the coming of WWII. Made in the magical movie year of 1939 (""Gone with the Wind,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Stagecoach,"" etc) in retrospect we know the cause of the war was nazi fanaticism and not greedy munitions manufacturers, the story is still absorbing and not at all ridiculous. Along with stars Gable and Shearer, a great supporting cast (Joseph Schildkraut, Laura Hope Crews, Edward Arnold, Charles Coburn, etc) and expert direction by Clarence Brown makes ""Idiot's Delight"" a fun couple of hours. If you are lucky, both endings (domestic and international) will be included.",1274054400,6,1223,4.908212560386473
388856,4,6301969022,"""How Strange"" is a phrase you hear throughout this movie and it's certainly appropriate.  Gable and Shearer play down on their luck Vaudevillians who cross paths for 24 hours in Omaha during a traveling tour. She falls for him but he's not ready to settle down. They part and 20 years pass before they meet again.. or do they?  Gable's character is a little older and wiser but Shearer's character Irene has reinvented herself as ""Irrrena"" an impossibly exotic Russian expatriate who denies ever knowing Gable. The setting this time is central Europe just before WWII is declared.  As played,  Shearer's  character is so over the top as to border on camp. Gable doesn't quite know what to make of this creature and neither do we.  She's like a drag-queen impression of Greta Garbo, her role model (allegedly) for this part.  As the very real danger of war creeps ever closer Gable refuses to escape but stay's with the now stranded Irena. She drops the pretense and admits she is the Irene he knew in Omaha. As the bombs begin to fall they embrace and confess their undying love for each other.  When the bombers recede into the distance, the two lovers, amazed to be alive, clutch each other as the music swells. This film is an odd mixture of low comedy and a deadly serious anti-war message that packs quite a wallop. Watch for Gable singing and dancing ""Puttin on the Ritz"".  But mostly watch it for Shearer's IRRRENA!  How strange indeed.

I have seen the film many times since it was released, always with pleasure, a pleasure which was, I think, greater this time than previously. Possibly, this is because Gable and Shearer are long gone, so, too, Edward Arnold and Burgess Meredith, and Joseph Schildkraut (whom I last saw as Poppa Frank, in the Diary of Anne Frank on Broadway). Yes, Shearer, played the accent over the top, so to speak, but she delighted me nonetheless for it. She was supposed to be entirely artificial, as I read the character Sherwood intended. Gable's break with the Gable persona, developed since the beginning of the thirties, was a delight, never before or after was he given the freedom to be nothing but a free and easy song-and-dance man, not big on talent or sexual magnetism, not a Hunk, appealing to women and men, just a small time entertainer. Meredith plays, in exaggerated style, the same character he created on Broadway and repeated in one of my favorite movies of the time, Winterset. Charles Coburn (also long gone) carries off his small role well with only a bit of the 'end of the world bitter-comic' style intended as dominant theme while Arnold does the first rate job he always did, whether in an A or as Star of a B movie. We should remember in watching, that most of the people involved, in front of and behind the camera, experienced the First World War, lived through the relatively prosperous twenties and then the disastrous (for the ordinary person-if not for them) thirties. For them, there must have been a sense of Madness repeated..so soon.
