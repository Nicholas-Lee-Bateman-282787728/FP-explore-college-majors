8500462,5,B006LQ0QNI,"I'm interviewed here, about Ayn Rand. What's important about Objectivism is what Rand wrote and said. For those who knew her or are interested in what it was like to be around her there is this group of interviews.",1525824000,,214,4.512820512820513
8500463,5,B006LQ0QNI,"A variety of entertaining and thoughtful interviews with people who knew and worked with Ayn Rand directly. Each person has their own perspective, which helps me triangulate to who this incredible woman actually was. Of particular interest was the nearly universal experience of Ayn Rand as generous and patient with people in her early years, then increasingly judgmental and impatient in her later years. I found this to be both inspiring and tragic.",1482537600,,452,5.205479452054795
8500464,5,B006LQ0QNI,This philosophy should be the foundation of our society in contrast to the muddled  and unfocused mess that the majority adhere to.  Kudos to the Objectivist  Socity for putting out these DVD's featuring tho early pupils of Rand,1439683200,,228,4.947368421052632
8500465,5,B006LQ0QNI,"The three-disc (i.e., three-volume) set, entitled The Birth of Objectivist, has quite a bit going for it, but I must warn potential buyers to consider what the set offers or, rather, doesnt offer.  Anyone expecting to get a long biography of Rand or a comprehensive look at the genesis of Objectivism should reconsider the investment.  Additionally, those seeking an Ayn-Rand-Institute approved pastiche of accounts of the genesis should also reconsider.  On the scale of bias, ranging from Peikoffs take and a cold unsympathetic biographical take, like Hellers, this one sits somewhere in the middle.  I think this is safe to say, being that The Objectivist Historical Projects presentation, here, is more journalism than it is history, where individuals involved with Rand are recalling to memory, as best they can, whatever they can recall some four(?!) decades later.

Nonetheless, the five-star rating, I feel, is merited on the grounds that this presentation serves as a unique supplement to the numerous biographies of Rand, portrayals of Objectivism, and, I might add, literature on the initial reception of Rands work.  For those interested in the fascinating character of Ayn Rand, her thought, and her philosophical movement, this is fairly important viewing.  While there is definitely room for complaint about what the project could have entailed, at less than three hours of viewing time, I think it extremely insightful, pound-for-pound.

I recommend this to anyone with an already-established knowledge of Rand, Objectivism, and anyone seeking to go beyond the basics.  I definitely do not recommend this as an introduction to Objectivism, etc.",1407801600,14,1660,5.403100775193798
