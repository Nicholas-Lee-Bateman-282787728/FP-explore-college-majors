8226040,4,B000WY9BSG,I used to get up with Cynthia every morning! She was a little goofy but in a good way. She made it fun to work out. Someone should get these on DVD. They'd make a fortune.,1351036800,5,171,3.7777777777777777
8226041,5,B000WY9BSG,"Cynthia Kereluk used to have a daily television show that aired in many countries.  From working out with this tape, it's easy to see why she stayed on the air for as many years as she did. She's a little corny, but this workout is so easy to follow, and she suggests modifications constantly.  She also uses a kind of ""picture in picture"" with a more advanced level showing off to the right of the screen.  The tape includes a warm up and cool down, and pulse counts to check if you're working too hard or not hard enough.  I've never found another workout video that's as enjoyable and easy to follow as this one.  She's the best video instructor I've ever seen, and I wish I could find more of her tapes.  I stumbled on this one at a garage sale, and I've been returning to it whenever I start a new workout routine for several years now.  One of these days, I'll have to figure out how to copy it on to a DVD, since finding it on DVD doesn't seem possible.",1296345600,6,960,4.184782608695652
