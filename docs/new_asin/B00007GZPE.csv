1810253,5,B00007GZPE,"I thought the video was very good.  Denise broke it down into three work-outs which you can do all at once or break them down and do at different times of the day or week.  I thought that she motivated very well and that she was easy to follow.  It was challenging in some places, but, to me, that's what makes a great work-out and pushes you to succeed your own expectations.  Thank you very much.  Keep making more great work outs Denise!",1041897600,8,440,4.253012048192771
1810254,4,B00007GZPE,"I am a fan of Denise's in spite of her being, well, Denise Austin.
 You cannot help but love her and her motivating us to continually battle the bulge! I was very annoyed with this video at first, I have been doing yoga on and off for two years and I was a) not crazy about the variations she added to the Ashtanga, and b) the music was HORRID for yoga. That being said, every single muscle was worked, the second segment was wonderful, and the third was effective and a lot of fun- I loved the ball workout,my back felt thoroughly stretched. So there you have it- buy it if you want to add to your yoga collection but don't expect an orthodox power yoga session. I will try to do this video in addition to her Pilates for Every Body and I will see what happens, so far I feel that every muscle in my body was worked and elongated.  So never mind the annoying aspects- go Denise!",1040515200,37,879,4.1647058823529415
1810261,2,B00007GZPE,"Thankfully, I bought this DVD at a library sale.  That said, here's why I dislike the DVD so much to give it a generous two-star rating.

I wondered why it was called ""fat-blasting yoga."" It's because she adds in aerobic moves.  It's not even Ashtanga. It's yoga moves with aerobic moves, and some are poorly cued.  Honestly, she moves so quickly that someone could get hurt.

If someone is interested in learning yoga, this is definitely not the DVD to try. There are so many more DVDs out there that are so much better.

If someone wants to lose weight through yoga, I'm sure there are better yoga DVDs out there where each movement is linked with one breath, such as Ashtanga.

Another annoyance is that modifications aren't shown.  I know enough about yoga to modify poses.  Standing big toe pose?  Seriously?

Oh, and the names she calls yoga poses. Yes, I get that she's trying to introduce the masses to yoga, but at least use their English name, not ""airplane pose"" for half-moon pose. I don't even remember what she called pyramid pose.

This was my first time with a Denise Austin DVD.  She's a bit over the top, with her eyes opening wide (creepy) and her constant chatter.  She needs to leave yoga to the yoga experts and stick with fitness.

Honestly, if you do any kind of yoga at all, skip this one.  It's unsafe. Denise is annoying. There are so many better options out there.

The positives:  nice music, there were other people behind her, so it wasn't just here.  The set is okay.  The cameras were on her and the others in a way that helped since her cuing was so off.",1448150400,,1588,4.466898954703833

1810267,5,B00007GZPE,"I guess I love this DVD because I've been using it for years and bought several as I occasionally left it somewhere I'd travelled. It is low-impact, and moves faster than a lot of yoga programs so it's more aerobic. I feel more in shape doing this than when I tried joining a gym and using equipment.  It's time- and money-efficient and it really works your balancing muscles which is important as I age. People tend to fall more as they get older because they don't do that. They get that wide-stanced gait rocking back and forth from one leg to the other to maintain their balance. Using this DVD I bet I'll have a younger person's gait into my 80's. The only thing I'm not crazy about is her patronizing commentary. Don't worry if you feel completely unable to do these moves at first. Keep trying...you'll develop the muscles.",1428105600,5,830,4.533333333333333

At least of this wonderful workout she has designed.  It is not a ""relaxing yoga workout"", as some have criticized.  Nor was it meant to be, in evidence by the title, ""Fat Blasting Yoga"".  It is fun to do, and the hour passes by very quickly.  That's simply great for a workout DVD!  Also, I have a lot of back problems, and this workout did not hurt my back.  In fact, my back feels pain-free after I do this workout.

1810306,4,B00007GZPE,"If you are a yoga purist, you will hate this workout.  (Refrain from sneering and just move on to Rodney Yee's Power Yoga DVD series, through Gaiam.)  But if you are a pragmatist who wants an effective workout you can easily adjust according to your schedule -- like me -- then this DVD is perfect.  Yes, Denise is way too talky for yoga (mute button works for this) and this is least graceful you'll probably ever see yoga demonstrated (which is why some of her transitions between poses are awkward), but if you do this workout as she prescribes, it really does deliver results.  I like that I can opt to do all 3 modules (30 minutes of cardio conditioning, 15 minutes of strength conditioning, and 15 minutes of core conditioning) or at the very least, I can knock out the 30-minute cardio section daily.  And if you can't do all of the poses, you can work up to them.",1361318400,2,871,4.41875

1810308,5,B00007GZPE,"As a Denise Austin fan for about ten years, I love this DVD. I like her motivating words and reminders to ""smile you're burning butter!""  Her focus is on quality versus quantity.  I'm currently about four months pregnant and up until recently this workout served as a good light impact exercise to help me stay fit.  I can see myself still using this DVD after the baby to get back in shape.",1358467200,,391,4.402777777777778
1810309,3,B00007GZPE,"I never finished the video because you need a yoga ball. It was never mentioned in other reviews. The first part was as usual with Denise its more about exercise then yoga,however you always get a good work out with her program.",1348876800,,228,4.4523809523809526

1810312,2,B00007GZPE,"This is not yoga.  This is what happens when you take a spastic high-energy aerobics instructor and have her try to settle down and do yoga.  I don't think Denise Austin even understands what the concept of yoga is all about.  This video is awful.  If you are beginning learning yoga, stay far far away.  I don't even know what you call this, but it should be banned from using the word yoga.

I am giving it 2 stars b/c maybe you could burn some fat if you could stand getting though it which I could not.  I'm not saying it's not fat blasting, I'm just saying it's not yoga.",1333929600,2,576,4.181818181818182
1810313,5,B00007GZPE,"I have used this video on and off for years, and it works if you are dedicated to the program.  She uses traditional poses, and weaves them into a heart rate elevating program.  Some of the poses are difficult, but as she says ""just do the best that you can do"".  I agree with some of the other reviewers, her encouragement can be a bit ""cheese"", but hey, we can use a little cheese from time to time!

Even if you don't have time to do the entire 60 minute program, just do what you can.  Often I don't do the last segment with the ball.  It is the perfect DVD to cater to your needs.

1810317,5,B00007GZPE,"I have done yoga for years. While I love the traditional classes, recently after doing power yoga for awhile, I wanted something else. This was exactly what I was looking for! She uses common yoga positions then modifies them incorporating moves you've seen in common fitness classes. After doing any yoga, I was never sore, but after one day of this, I was! Worth a try (I tried it for free on hulu to see if I liked it). Now, I'm adding it to my wishlist.",1325376000,2,457,4.325581395348837

I've been having this DVD for almost 8 years, and I keep going back to it!  Everytime I put it on, she makes me smile, and I feel like she is right there in the room with me, encouraging me in every step!  She's such a delight to watch! Granted, if you're looking for a more relaxing yoga DVD, I would check out Rodney Yee.  He is amazing and really encourages a more spiritual approach to yoga, which I love.  Denise is just very uplifting and a bit talkative, so if this is a concern, look elsewhere.  But this will remain a favorite of mine, and I highly recommend it. :)",1322870400,6,689,4.213740458015267

She is at once and the same time energetic, athletic, thoughtful, and deceptively sexy.  Again, you have to like or love Denise Austin to consider this disk.  If you are an adherent or aspirant to yoga in general, there are many yoga disks out there that are much better.  In fact, Denise Austin has made better ones.  This disk has some stretching and posing which is somewhat parallel to yoga but I would not pick this as my first choice to learn of or practice the fine art of yoga...",1319068800,2,608,4.4324324324324325

1810321,5,B00007GZPE,"Ok, let me tell you, this video is excellent. I've been struggling with my weight for a long time, and sure, I'm pretty young and will probably lose weight faster, but this video ALWAYS gives me motivation and results!

I don't even do the full hour when I do it. I just do the cardio, because it's REALLY hard, but it flies by. I think my knees hurt because I don't always do the poses right, and you definitely need a yoga mat for some of the workouts because your feet can slip and it gets REALLY annoying, but it's SO good. I'm not doing it right now, but I just wanted people to know that I absolutely love the video. I'm thinking of starting on it again. I've had it for four years and never really pulled through all 21 days, however, I think if I did, I'd have gotten an excellent body.

I know people say it's unhealthy to lose more than a pound of fat a week, but Denise had me losing POUNDS a week. Not to mention inches! You also feel really good about yourself afterwards, not because ""you did it"", but because yoga just makes you feel really good.

Once I began this workout, I had fun doing it with my friends and was able to stick with it until my friend who owned the DVD moved away.  Denise Austin doesn't use true yoga here, but I don't mind since I'd rather feel like I'm accomplishing something.  It's somewhat exhausting in the moment, but still totally do-able for a 20-something beginner like me.  You'll probably be tired and sore the next day, but in a good way!  I could tell my muscle tone was improving and my flexibility went through the roof!  I went from not being able to touch my ankles to being able to put my palms completely on the floor.  I also like that it is low-impact, since other cardio activites like running or traditional aerobics usually cause me pain because of my high arches.

1810324,4,B00007GZPE,"I am new to yoga but do aerobics nearly everyday.  Denise has found a way to really combine yoga with a cardio workout.  It is not a jarring workout like aerobics can be, but gets your heart rate up with fluid quick paced yoga moves.  I am not able to do all of the yoga moves ""fully"", being new to yoga and not a very flexible person.  After this workout I am SO stretched out, it feels wonderful!

I looked at other yoga tapes and most have workouts that are 30-60 minutes.  What I really like about Denise's program is that there is a 30 minute routine and two 15 minute routines, plus you can do as much or as little of the program as you want by selecting the chapters you want to do.  This allows me to add on 15-30 minutes of yoga to my aerobics, great combination!

I admit that I am quite fit, being a dancer and regular exerciser anyway, but I often sweat with other yoga videos (like the Total Yoga Fire). The asanas aren't hard, and her instructions (or lack thereof) are not helpful. Apart from that, i found her voice to be so annoying that it distracted me from my form and breathing, which is something that's hard to make me do.

I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, so I was looking for low-impact exercises that still left me feeling strong and like I had actually exercised.  This is it for me.  I can do almost every pose/step in this work-out.

This dvd is divided into three different sessions, so you can do one or all depending on your time allowance.  The third session uses an exercise ball.

I recommend this tape or DVD to anybody who loves yoga and is a fan of Denise Austin,1230768000,3,459,4.215909090909091
1810336,5,B00007GZPE,"I really like Denise Austin and she is a great motivator.  She may talk a little much but this DVD is great!!  I am in between beginner and intermediate level and this dvd is challenging and effective.  It is split up into three sections which is nice so if you don't have time to do the whole thing, doing one or two sections will still give you a good workout.  The first segment is my favorite because I love sun salutations and the moves she demonstrates really warms up the body and tones your legs and butt!!  I have been doing this for about two and a half weeks and notice my legs and arms are tighter.  God Bless Yoga!!",1229644800,2,628,4.191666666666666
1810337,4,B00007GZPE,"This is a high energy workout for someone who likes to do yoga but has a hard time getting the motivation for cardio.  It is fast paced and fun, and if you are familiar with basic yoga poses is a great addition to your yoga practice!!",1228003200,,234,4.086956521739131
1810338,5,B00007GZPE,My mom had gotten this on VHS a few years back and I loved it then. I knew its one of the only Yoga DVDs that doesn't concentrate on the spiritual ideas but incorporates some ideas with the exercise. I am not big on the spiritual concepts of Yoga but I love the movements. The cardio workout is hard for beginners but it is easy to learn.,1228003200,2,338,4.059701492537314
1810346,1,B00007GZPE,This is an excellent exercise video.  It combines cardio with YOGA moves for a total body workout.  Very good!!!,1220832000,,112,4.842105263157895
1810347,5,B00007GZPE,"I've had this DVD workout now for a few years, and I have to say I really love it!  I know some find Denise's chirpy style annoying, but I don't think she's like that at all in this DVD..  and I must say I've never heard her say 'Yea yoga' - and I've done this DVD hundreds of times!  perhaps its in the intro??

I find this a fantastic all over workout that is surprisingly effective in toning up given I'm generally a cardio workout lover..  I always feel so incredibly energised by this workout.  I actually feel healthier and more alive at the end of it!  seriously!

This is NOT however a spiritual type yoga DVD - it's a little faster paced than that and doesn't have that kind of yoga music that those type of DVDs do..  but I don't mind that, I see this as somewhere between a workout and yoga - and I really like that..

It's also fab for doing during that time of the month, rather than a full on cardio workout - as it's nurturing as well as energising and strenuous.

The only caution I would give is about the move which involves putting one foot up above the other knee and then sitting back.  I pulled my back on this move and I'd never had a back problem before, so I'd warn people to be very very careful on that move - and also the big toe stretch which also seems to pull on that same lower back muscle that I pulled.  Maybe that's specific to me - but just be careful.  I just do the chair pose while she's doing these ones.  It's only a minute or so, so it doesn't affect the overall workout at all.

You will need a yoga/pilates ball though for the third section, and ideally also a yoga mat.  Though I did it on the carpet for quite a while before I got a mat and it was fine..

I feel this workout has really stood the test of time for me.  I keep coming back to it, and really enjoy the workout.

I highly recommend it..",1217548800,3,1845,4.058171745152355

I like the workouts, I feel like I taking it kind of easy, but still getting a good work out if i do the first segment alone. On a really good day I go through all the segments, however there are a couple moves in the strength section that I will never be able to do and there are some movements in the ball section that i don't have room for in my living room. I had no problems catching on to the workout; since i got the disc i've taken several yoga classes at my gym and still use this workout at home.",1214438400,,640,3.8931297709923665

1810350,2,B00007GZPE,Denise Austin is a fantastic aerobic instructor but her yoga workouts are not something I recommend.  This workout is a yogaerobics workout - that's fine if that's what you're looking for.  I'm pretty advanced at yoga but her lack of guidance and jarring movements can cause serious injury to a non beginner.  Her voice is distracting because of the constant upbeat chatter and the music is just as distracting.  No focus on mindfulness - very important factor here! There is no real seamless movement into asanas as there should be.  After her workout I was more annoyed than relaxed - as you should be after serious yoga practice. She doesn't explain what the poses are for beginners - she jumps right in as if you should know them already.  Grant it - it will make you sweat and give you a good workout but you have to be careful because if you can't keep up - you run the risk of injury.  She should stick to aerobic workouts.,1213920000,2,930,4.5

I am so impressed with this DVD, it has seriously changed my entire life.  I have suffered from neck and upper/lower back pain for over 10 years.  I am 31 years old.  I have worked out forever, tried massage therapy....chiropractors....heating pads....sleeping differently.....20 different pillows, etc, etc.  Doing the first 30 minute session of this video 4 times a week, made all of my pain go away.  I cannot say enough about this DVD, even though Denise can get a little cheesy!  You gotta love her though!  I took a month 1/2 break from doing it, and my neck/back pain came back.  I think that Yoga is the body's natural way to stay healthy and this is a great DVD to try out! :)",1206748800,,799,4.455172413793103

And now I know that the one I used to do was Yoga Buns, which is much better and slower than this!  When I first watched this video, I was VERY dissapointed.  The very beginning of this video you are moving so fast that you don't really feel a stretch, and you aren't building any muscle.  Plank position really kills my arms, but if we're only in plank position for 2 seconds, I don't feel a thing.  The second part is slower, but it's only 15 minutes.  I think she should have made a Part 2 section that is the same as Part 1, but a lot slower.  She's going so fast so that you can burn fat, which I'm not so sure it's very affective at doing so, but I'd much rather be strong and flexible an really feel a stretch.  If you're new to yoga, don't buy this video.  Buy something a lot slower and really learn the names of the poses.  If you don't know the names, you won't really be able to do this video.  I do plan on continuing to use it, as I am now used to the pace of this video.  However, I am also in a weekly yoga class that does everything much much slower.",1202774400,,1213,3.9382716049382718

Yes, the postures resemble yoga, but the pace and repetitions are enough to qualify as a hard aerobic workout. Maybe I should have tuned into the word ""blasting"" because blasted is what my body felt like after a couple of minutes trying to keep up with Ms Austin. If you are looking for a traditional yoga class, pass on this one. You'll find little peace in this workout.",1188432000,3,481,4.415730337078652
1810366,1,B00007GZPE,"First of all, if you like Denise Austin I'm sure this dvd won't be as unappealing to you as it was for me.  I own only one other workout by her and I thought it was ok, but it was aerobics based- which she is good at instructing.
I received this dvd as a gift.  I've been doing hatha yoga for years for flexibility, balance and stress management.  Lately, I've been wanting to ""step it up a notch"" to try and loose weight with yoga along with some other types of exercise.  The package on this dvd said everything I wanted to hear and even the introduction sounded like what I was looking for.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  Denise clearly states in the intro that the benefits of yoga are isometric holds and the vinyasa flow (moving from one pose to another seamlessly).  The first half of the DVD is like yoga-robics where she is clumsily jumping around and throwing in some yoga poses, but they aren't held long enough to do anything!  I found it very hard to keep up due to her lack of instruction and I would not recommend this for people who are out of shape looking for exercise.
The only real yoga is on the second half (strengh conditioning).  But again, she butchers it via a lack of flow that is really the whole point of yoga.  Instead, you assume a pose, hold it, then switch to the other side.  Then she does another pose, etc.  Warrior is supposed to morph into triangle, not be stepped into it.

In general, I would not recommend this for yoga beginners or even experienced yoga practitioners.  This dvd is so out there I have no idea who it's being marketed to.  It's part aerobics, part very basic yoga done wrong, and even part tai chi (which isn't mentioned anywhere on the package and has no relation to yoga).  I took this dvd to moviestop and exchanged it with two gaiam yoga dvds that I am much happier with.  I certainly learned my lesson: aerobics and yoga should be done seperately and I am never buying another Denise Austin dvd again!",1185753600,3,1976,4.36986301369863
1810367,5,B00007GZPE,"This is the first yoga and/or Denise Austin video I ever purchased, and I think it's fantastic.  Some of the moves are definitely challenging to master and take coordination, but they get easier to do with practice.  After the first couple of days, I felt stronger and more energized.  I took a yoga class after working out with this video for a while, and the instructor swore that I had taken yoga classes before.  My fiancee (who is one of the most uncoordinated/balanced people I know) even uses this workout and likes it.  The only equipment it requires is a stability ball.  I have the VHS version, and it is conveniently broken into 3 segments that you can do separately or all together.  This is NOT an aerobic workout, as you are not constantly moving and your heart rate does not become accelerated (the definition of an aerobic workout).  If you want to get stronger and more flexible, I would certainly recommend this video.",1184976000,2,936,4.664634146341464

1810372,3,B00007GZPE,"I wrote a longer, more detailed review that was deleted accidentally. This is my first Denise Austin dvd, but I've been doing yoga for about 5 years.
In this she was very perky, like most aerobics instructors & remind you how hard you ware working, how this is working your abs or legs which just made me feel like I was killing my energy for no reason other then to kill off calories. She would sigh & grunt a bit & only once in a while say that it's a good stretch. *roll eyes* There was no instruction whatsoever & the only modifying was maybe looking at the backup 4 women & 1 guy. The set was a small carpeted all around set ala 1990s.
1st 30 min workout: Yoga cardio conditioning:
The music's tempo was very fast & was the usual cheap electronic stuff most use.  It starts with sun salutations, then with chair pose, she would add squats & lifting of a leg. With warrior pose, she would have you go backwards for lunges back/forth, for 3 legged standing, she'd have you get out of it & lift a knee back/forth & the same for tree pose with ""tai chi ball"" arm pose that is a way to look more ""zen"" but does nothing but rape & insult the beautiful, mind/health thousands of year old artform. This is not for anyone new to yoga & those in yoga would find this too easy & boring. Those who have issues with flexibility & balance would find the pace & lack of modifications to fast to keep up.
2nd 15 min workout: Yoga strength conditioning
The music is a tad slower & nicer, dealable. She assumes you're already warmed up & goes right into side angle pose, triangle pose, twisted triangle, standing wide legged bend, 3 legged downward dog, modified bow pose, 1 hand/1 knee balance pose, torso side stretches, twisted sage pose, sitting wide legged side stretches & fwd stretch, with hero's pose, child's pose & a lot of mountain poses in between for rests. This I liked better since there were more poses involved then most mainstream yoga dvds, she would hold some poses a decent amount of time & she didn't try to aerobicise it. She was still perky with ""this works the abs.. this is good for leg circulation"" comments *well, duh* I gave the 3 stars for this part.
The 3rd 15 min workout is with a stability ball which I do not want to own since it takes up space.
All in all, if you ALREADY have yoga dvds & have the flexibility & balance  to do the above poses, can do it confidently w/o added help, don't like the style of a dvd that teaches the mind/body connection with proper breathing,  and are more happy with a more cardio gym style workout, this is for you.

At first I didn't think that I could handle her, but once I started to concentrate on the moves, I didn't mind her so much, and her constant commentary is actually helpful, so that you can follow along by listening and not having to keep looking at the TV screen.

If you want a yoga tape in which poses are held for any length of time- this is not the dvd for you. If you are a beginner this is not the tape for you as she gives no instruction on the moves and how to do them. Every piece of this dvd annoyed me.

She moves too quickly through poses that need to be taken slowly to ensure you are doing each properly. Breathing is imp., as she addressed in the beginning of the tape, but it is not stressed throughout the routine. Not my favorite Denise workout- I like her Hit the Spot Pilates much better. I recommend the Richard Freeman's DVD for Yoga Practice- but I think all new yogies should attend classes prior to doing it by themselves.

1810386,5,B00007GZPE,"I'm rather suprised at the less-than-stellar reviews for this dvd, as it's one of my favorites. I'm going to go ahead and jump straight into listing the pros and cons:

CONs:

-as a previous reviewer states, the back of the DVD states that there are three segments, but then on the tv menu, there are 10 chapters. The way the dvd is formatted, there's really two main segments: cardio-conditioning and strength training-esque segment. I guess the third segment would be working out the core muscles (the abs) with the stability ball, but it's kind of lumped in with the strength segment.

-strength training segment seems a bit useless and redundant. I feel like I'm better off using weights to strengthen my muscles, so I always skip this section.

-if you're looking for a purely yoga dvd, you'll be disappointed, because this isn't pure yoga, but a yoga-inspired workout. She takes certain poses from yoga and turns them into intervals of quasi-cardio workouts. It obviously won't have the same effects of kickboxing, but doing these poses and moves DOES generate heat and causes you to sweat a bit.

PROs:

-like I said above, you do sweat, and that's always a plus in my book.

-improves your flexibility. I always feel so nice and stretched out when I've done this workout.

-it's different and adds a little variety to the workout routine. I can't do intensive workouts every day, but I do like to stay active and do at least SOMETHING every day...so this is a nice break from my regular kickboxing/step/running days. It's not too intense, but it definitely does something for me.

-Happily, Denise is a bit more mellowed out in this workout. Usually she's annoyingly perky in her workouts, but here she's relatively calm...I'm guessing b/c it's yoga and perkiness just doesn't go with the mood...

-I usually never bother to do the end-of-the-workout stretching in most tapes/dvds I own, but I just love the one in here. It's so relaxing and very nice on the muscles, especially the back.

So all in all, this is a pretty good dvd if you're looking for something different to try. In all honesty, you WON'T be going down to a size 0 even if you do this every day. You'll need to mix this up with more intense workouts to see any real weightloss, if that's what you're aiming for. But this makes a really nice supplement to a regular workout routine, or a workout in itself on light days, where you're just not up for a lot of exertion.",1152576000,4,2443,4.671328671328672

1810391,4,B00007GZPE,"I've been using this DVD off and on for a few weeks.  The first segment is a combination of some basic yoga moves (tree, warrior, with tons of sun salutations thrown in) done in a really quick style for a cardio workout.  At first it seems challenging (especially for people who aren't familiar with these poses) because she moves very quickly.

I'm not too thrilled with the last 2 segments of the DVD, I really don't like the balance ball segment.  Some of these moves are very tricky to figure out.  I've had a better core workout from the Gaiam balance ball DVDs.

Denise's voice is a bit annoying at times (she has an ex-smoker/phone sex operator throaty voice) but she's always perky and encouraging, which, even for a cynic, can be helpful when you feel like you can't keep up!

Overall, it's a good workout!",1142380800,3,815,4.541095890410959
1810392,5,B00007GZPE,"This is the first yoga anything I've ever attempted and I love it! Denise Austin is one in her own. She is very perky and sometimes you notice exercises are not evenly distributed, she even catches the people exercising with her off guard.

I really enjoyed the DVD and have been using it about 3 times a week for 2 months. I have noticed a difference in my figure and a huge difference in my flexibility. I was the least flexible person ever, I could barely touch my ankles, but now I can comfortably reach past my toes!

I have a lot of fun with the workout and recommend it to any beginner.",1141257600,4,593,4.238938053097345

At first, I was not really sure about her talking during the workout, but then she grew on me. She is very positive, and you really feel the burn during moves.  It uses a lot of muscle groups and allows you to incorporate yoga into daily exercise. I have noticed a difference in my arms especially.  If you have done yoga, then this is similar to Ashtanga or power yoga. I wish she had another yoga video because this is truly a great workout.",1139702400,5,590,4.212389380530974

I did this workout a month before going on vacation for the summer and I did it 3x a week. After having my 3rd child which was a very difficult pregnancy, the workout helped get me back in shape. I saw results in 2 weeks! Trust me, this DVD is a must! But remember to eat healthy at all times. Either way, exercise equals more energy.",1139184000,3,456,4.134831460674158
1810395,5,B00007GZPE,"I bought this dvd simply for the balance ball segment at the end.  I have all the Gaiam balance ball titles and I wanted to add something else to my collection.  However, let me just say that I don't skip all the rest.  This dvd is great!  Yes, it is not true classic yoga.  Being a huge fan of Rodney Yee, I still really like this dvd for what it is...a great conditioning routine incorporating some yoga and core work.  It is not nearly as intense as some of Denise's other titles.  As for Denise herself, I have always really liked her and I find her very encouraging.  Some people do not like her voice but I think she's great and when I am exercising and would prefer to quit and go eat a piece of cake, hearing Denise say, ""This exercise is great for the waist"" or ""Just keep it up, you are doing great"" is enough to get me back on track!",1137801600,7,844,4.103658536585366
1810396,3,B00007GZPE,"I decided to rent this video and try it before I bought it.  I watched it first and immediately noticed that it was only yoga inspired.  It looks as though Denise may have taken a few yoga classes and decided to infuse some of the ideas into her normal conditioning routine.  Throughout the workout she passes off lunges as ""warriors"" and squats as ""chair poses"".  The poses are never done in true yoga fashion.  If you are truly interested in yoga rather than just a workout, check out some of Rodney Yee's videos.  His videos are challenging and very true to form.

  On the other hand, I decided to complete the workout before sending it back.  I DID sweat through the entire work out and was considerably sore the next day.  I will give it good marks for incorporating a lot of difficult balancing exercises - something most workout videos lack.  I also enjoyed the balance ball segment at the end because I find the ball to be one of the most helpful home gym tools.

  I think I'm going to have to do the workout a few more times before I make a final purchasing decision.  It was tough and not boring but because It lacks the focus on breathing and other aspects of yoga I may just stick to good 'ol Mr. Yee.

She rushes through the movements (yes, it's supposed to be a ""workout"", but it's definitely hard to keep up the first few times). She is not nice to look at.

1810398,4,B00007GZPE,"Contrary to what other have been writing, I firmly believe that this video is for beginners. Yes, admittedly it takes about 4 times of progressing through the video before the poses seem more natural and easier to do, but I was able to pick up the technique fine, and this is my first experience with yoga.

I have been working out to this video 3-5 times a week for the past 3 months and am noticing some SERIOUS results. Before I began using this video I was running 2-4 miles (3-5 times a week). This video is honestly such a workout that I consider the days I run 4 miles instead of working out with Ms. Denise a break!

Yes, Denise Austin can get a little annoying. Especially after listening to and watching the video so many times I have come to the firm conclusion that it was filmed in one take... there are inconsistencies and Denise does have a tendency to ramble. HOWEVER, it's worth putting up with in order to get such an awesome workout.

I highly recommend this video to anyone looking to see improvements in flexibility and body tone.",1133395200,9,1051,4.435233160621761
1810399,4,B00007GZPE,"I have had this DVD now for about five months and have finally decided to write a review on it based on all the negative comments about it swirling around.
NO, this is not pure yoga - you will not feel spiritual about it, however, if you give it a chance, you will feel and see that you have gotten a great workout from it.  The moves are fun, and yes, the cueing by Denise is not great, but like any other workout video you have to do it a couple of times before you feel into the groove with it.  I find her chatty style charming and motivating at first - but when I know the moves and can push and concetrate even harder by myself, I can block it out.
BELIEVE ME,  if you really do it right, you WILL see a difference in your backside and your legs.. I would highly recommend trying this - After using this a couple of times a week at first, I now work it in about once a week to throw in some variety...

My favorite part of this tape is that there are three different sections that can be done continuously or in different orders.  Sometimes I do just the first section, sometimes all of the sections, and sometimes the last section.  I would recommend this workout to people who are looking for an alternative to the traditional cardio workout or traditional yoga workout.  Denise may be annoying to some but she sure motivates me!  ""So when you wave good bye, nothing jiggles!""",1121731200,4,552,4.708333333333333

Unlike traditional yoga, this will make you work up a sweat and you'll feel like you got the best of both worlds- relaxation and stretching from the yoga and the cardiovascular challenge of great aerobics. If you are concerned about Denise's presentation style or ""yammering"" as others have called it, better watch her for free on Lifetime TV (she does early morning workouts of yoga, aerobics, etc) and see if you like her style before you buy. I find her to be motivating and encouraging!

I like this DVD- you will too.",1115596800,,624,4.672727272727273
1810402,4,B00007GZPE,"Yoga is apparently supposed to be a way of relaxing your mind and body.  This DVD does not do that.  It is not even real Yoga.  But as someone who is out of shape, do I really care?  What I want is some form of exercise - ANY form of exercise that I can do regularly, as in general, I am keen to find any excuse to run away from exercise.

Denise appreciates that there are only so many minutes in a day, and after a lifetime of putdowns, her praise and encouragement is helpful - sometimes cheesy and worn out, but helpful.

I am the sort of person who needs to be told 'You can do it!' and 'I'm proud of you', I believe Denise is sincere in her encouragement.  If you don't need this sort of praise, you will  probably find it irritating.

I don't mind that there are no instructional guides to how to do the poses - since that would stretch the length of the workout beyond a length of convenience.  In one of her other DVDs, she says 'I recommend that you watch the entire workout before you try it for yourself, since you're not always going to be able to see your TV set', and this is what I do now as a habit with any of her DVDs.

There are three workouts, and I can clearly distinguish where each workout begins and where it ends.

The first is 30mins of 'Cardio Conditioning', but really this is more like aerobics based on Yoga poses - it is NOT yoga.

The second workout is 15mins of 'Strength Conditioning', although it is more like resistance training using your own body weight as resistance instead of weights.  I find this difficult, being quite a heavy person, but I hope that the more I do the workout, the better I will get at it.

The final workout is 'Core Conditioning', an abdominal workout using a stability ball.  I haven't been able to do this workout yet without falling off the ball, but I am getting better, and hope that the more I stay at it, the more I will get out of it.

Like I said, I wasn't bothered about whether it was actually Yoga or not, I just wanted a form of exercise that I could stick to.  This has fulfilled those requirements for me, and as far as I'm concerned, thats all that matters.",1115510400,23,2136,4.193627450980392

I am not a ""yoga"" type of person. I like to keep moving and enjoy aerobics and dance moves. This workout included yoga moves but keeps moving. I don't think she anything more than a few times and it's on to something else. YES... the first time I looked like a fool, but once you do it several times it's great. The only moves that are repeated many times are the ""sun salutations"" and, if done right, they help stetch and tone.

There isn't enough focus on the proper form of breathing and how it relates to each position.  The positions are not developed to their full potential and are done at a quick pace. She does so many sun salutations that I started rolling my eyes every time I did one! This program is good for beginners but soon gets boring and repetitious.  Denise's over-the-top cheerful voice, while toned down in this program, takes away from the soothing calm that yoga provides.  I did like the other people in the program, however, because they had normal bodies, not super-perfect like in some programs.  I am disappointed that Denise Austin has gone the way of most successful exercise professionals, in that she jumps on the latest fad and develops a video for it.  I often wonder if I am doing the positions correctly because no real instruction is given.  Definitely not for true yoga enthusiasts, but OK for beginners.

There is zero attention paid to the importance of the breath, to getting in tune with your body, to the calming and focusing effects of yoga-- and thus, to everything that yoga is actually about. Instead, Ms. Austin has tailored some of her cardio routines so that she could slip in some yoga poses and market it as a yoga DVD. Worse yet, she provides no instruction on the poses and there is thus a high risk of injury. And, on top of the ridiculously un-yogic practice itself, the tape is backed with high-energy music and her constant, mindless yammering. There's not a moment of silence in this entire routine. The woman obviously has no idea of what yoga is about in the least, immediately evidenced by the cover which, appropriately, shows her in a yoga-like pose, not an actual one.

The chapter entitled ""Introduction to Yoga"" consists of Denise talking about yoga, but gives no demonstrations or intructions on technique.  Also, the description of the DVD on the back of the case says that there are three different workouts:  one 30-minute and two 15-minute.  In actuality, you must choose from 10 chapters:

1. Intro to Yoga

2. Cardio Conditioning

3. The Warrior Series

4. Balancing Stick Series

5. Tree Pose Series

6. Strength Conditioning

7. Twist and Stretch

8. Core Conditioning

9. Obliques

10. Focus on Abdominals

Again, this is NOT for beginners.  When you choose a chapter, you are just thrown into a workout, without any instruction (i.e. ""Let's begin with a warrior pose"").  Having never done yoga before, I have no idea what a warrior pose is.  If you are a beginner, I recommend Yoga Journal's Yoga Step by Step.",1104192000,42,963,4.981012658227848

I worked up a sweat, but I could have easily injured myself if I hadn't modified the poses on my own. Also, the final workout is not possible without a stability ball so if you want to work your abs and you don't own a ball than you will get no help from this DVD.",1098403200,2,539,4.142857142857143

Once the basics are learned, following along with this DVD is easy.
I do wish there were alternative exercises for those who do not have the exercise ball in the 15 min ab segments.  I skip this part.
Contrary to all the negative comments about Denise's perkiness, I find her helpful and uplifting, and she keeps me on task. The reminders about body positions are necessary.

First, I find Denise's voice and continuous pep talk annoying.  She has an overly cheerful style that can quickly become irritating, especially when she coos something like, ""This is my favorite stretch!"" or, ""Yea, YOGA!""
Second, I find the exercises too difficult and the moves too fast.  For example, she has you balancing on one leg while swinging your other leg -- definitely not for the uncoordinated.
Third, she doesn't do much explaining of the exercises -- hardly any, in fact.  I guess you're supposed to be able watch her carefully while trying to follow, ""Down dog, up dog! Down dog, up dog, down dog -- aaand up dog!""
Finally, she doesn't suggest any alternative moves or strategies for those of us who aren't up to her level of balance or flexibility.  Figuring out that I'll need a chair to hold onto lightly while doing the one-legged exercises was easy, but actually using the chair is difficult because she changes moves/sides so often.  She doesn't give you time to perfect the positions or work on your stretch in case you aren't able to reach your big toe (or whatever).
I'm not totally giving up on the DVD, but I'm not very happy with it.  If I had it to do over, I'd choose something else.",1089244800,32,1370,4.640495867768595

I also lost 10 pounds and have more energy. The workout is not too strenuous. I never even do the whole hour, usually just one of the workouts of about a 20-minute duration. Denise is in her 40's also, so I found that encouraging.  Like Denise says, ""If you rest, you'll rust."" Buy the DVD and get moving!",1086739200,13,634,4.372881355932203

If you want a Yoga workout or a meditative experience, get either Baron Baptiste, Rodney Yee or take a class at your local gym/studio.

I had trouble making it through the yoga workout the first time I tried it, but after about 2 weeks, I noticed significant improvement in my strength, balance, and endurance.  The second and third parts are about 15 minutes each, focusing on strength training.  An exercise ball is used in the third section.  This video can be done all at once, or a section at a time depending on your schedule.  All three are excellent workouts and you will feel sore the next day!  Those of you who are familiar with Denise Austin's style will not be surprised, or let down, by this video.  For those of you who are not familiar with Denise, I recommend simply watching the video through once so you get the idea of the routine.  Denise tends to change moves quickly without a lot of notice and you may find that difficult at first.  Once you've done the workout a few times, it's easier.  I had no Yoga experience when I first bought this video, but I had no trouble learning the moves.

The first yoga section is much too fast to be yoga, but doesn't move enough to be a cardio section.  There are several segments of different types of poses like tree pose and warrior pose, but you don't really get a chance to hold any of the poses.  Between each segment Denise quickly runs through a sun salutation.  By the end I was just thinking `oh no, not again.'  There is little chance to learn the poses or the routines that Denise goes through really quickly.  They're not really that hard, but in some of the positions it is hard to see what she is doing, and she doesn't give very good cues.  Some of the moves and positions are quite difficult or you have to be pretty flexible to do them, and there are no alternatives.  During one of the segments, I just sat there, but I couldn't think of an alternative way to do the exercise.  I wouldn't say that most of the moves are too difficult for beginners, but going through it the first time was harder than it is for other yoga programs such as the yoga zone series.
The strength segment was a lot of fast lunges and fast balancing poses.  It was much like the previous section only faster.  The second and third segments could be put together for a shorter workout or the first segment done alone.
I liked the stability ball segment and wished that it were longer.  There were a lot of unique exercises for abs and glutes, but again Denise goes through the moves very quickly and there is time only for a few repetitions of each move.  The workout ends abruptly without any real cool down.  Usually I feel relaxed after doing yoga, but not after this workout.  All in all, I found the entire workout too long.  There wasn't enough yoga for it to be yoga and there wasn't enough strength or cardio for it to be either of those either, and Denise talks constantly through the entire thing.

Check out the tapes from Living Arts ...or better yet, if possible, take the money you would have spent on this and get yourself to a live class, where a real teacher can provide insights, feedback and corrections!",1076371200,3,536,4.37
1810430,5,B00007GZPE,"Denise Austin really is an awesome and motivating fitness instructor!  I just bought this on DVD yesterday and I haven't worked out in months, and I have a 13 month old baby and 6 year old, it's important that I keep in shape, and I also am in the military, so I HAVE to be in shape.  This is an awesome, motivating way to start your Weight Loss Goals in 2004!  Way to go Denise, another awesome VIDEO! :-) I felt so good afterwards, I actually had the energy the next morning to get up and run my 1 1/2 mile run on the Treadmill.  Thanks Denise. :-)",1073865600,4,550,4.064814814814815
1810431,5,B00007GZPE,"I love all of denise videos.  She is so motivating.  I  purchased two kathy smith videos and i DO NOT LIKE HER.  She has a funny shaped body like a frog standing on his hind legs.  I love denise austin voice, music,  background and well she just looks better than kathy smith.  Kathys arms are as long as her legs.  That's weird.",1072396800,,329,4.193548387096774
1810432,1,B00007GZPE,I found this workout NOT yoga I have no idea what Denise was swinging her arms around for at all and jumping all over the place like she just had a hit of cocaine or something.  Her voice was annoying and constant...she should have been trying out for a . waitress.  I am tossing this stupid tape!,1071878400,2,297,4.192982456140351
1810433,2,B00007GZPE,"I have a number of Denise's videos and while I find her voice and comments annoying ( I turn down the sound and put music on), I usually like her workouts.  I have done yoga for 2 years and have run, biked and done strength-training all my life, so I'm in better shape than the average 40+ woman.  I would NOT recommend these workouts for the average person.  It moves too fast in places and too slow in others. If your balance isn't that of a gymnast, you will be falling over numerous times and struggling to figure out what the heck she's doing.  I like to workout hard, but this is just not a well-designed workout.  Crunch's Perfect Yoga Workout is much better, especially the Fat Burning Workout.
Don't waste your money, if you can do this workout - you don't need it!!",1067990400,,775,4.354166666666667
1810434,5,B00007GZPE,"This is Fat-Blasting yoga, it is not traditional yoga.  The box clearly states that the poses are performed ""in a flowing style to increase the heart rate, boost metabolism and burn calories and fat.""  If you're looking for a DVD to teach you the traditional poses and breathing techniques, this is not the one.  If you're looking to lose some weight and gain some flexibility, this is an excellent choice.
My goal when I set out three weeks ago was to lose 50 lbs by next summer, and by alternating this DVD with Denise's ""Pilates for Every Body"" (along with a better diet), I have already lost 10 lbs.  It is difficult to give an overall loss, because these programs build muscle, which, of course, weighs more than fat.  Suffice it to say, I have a very defined waistline again, my stomach has flattened out considerably, and I can see definite muscle tone in my arms and legs.
I have had a difficult time in the past sticking to exercise programs, but I now find that I start to feel a bit sketchy if I haven't worked out by around 7 p.m. This workout is fun, and I found early on that you can do your own slight modifications to the poses until you've gained the flexibility to do them the way they are taught.  I look forward to working out every day, and I especially enjoy ""Yoga Days.""  After three weeks, I am more flexible, more balanced and more focused - and did I mention, lighter?
One complaint: I'm certain that in the Balancing Stick series, she has you doing one leg twice and the other leg four times, and I'm not sure she's consistent with count on other exercises.  Once you get familiar with the workout, though, you can adjust for that.
Denise tends to say ""This is my favourite,"" for several stretches or moves.  This is not as annoying as funny, when you realize that she really loves what she's doing.  She's very motivating, and she seems to realize that not everyone is at her fitness level.
Incidentally, I have suffered knee, shoulder and back injuries through gymnastics, and I find that this video does not aggravate those at all.  I recommend, however, purchasing a stability ball if you're serious about this workout.  It really takes the pressure off your back when doing things such as situps and double-leg stretches.",1063238400,38,2253,4.5632754342431765
1810445,5,B00007GZPE,"I'D LIKE TO SAY ,THAT I USED THE FAT BLASTING VIDEO FOR YOGA AND I LOVED IT. I THOUGHT DENISE WAS GREAT AND THE INSTRUCTIONS SIMPLE. THE BEST PART TO ME WAS THAT THROUGH OUT THE VIDEO DENISE IS ALWAYS TELLING ME TO DO MY BEST(MY BEST) NOT TO WORRY THAT I'M NOT ABLE TO DO SOME OF THE MOVES, (YET). THAT REALLY SHOWS ME SHE CARES AND I KNOW IN TIME I TOO WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO DO ALL THE MOVES. THIS IS MY FIRST YOGA TAPE AND I LOVED IT SO MUCH I WENT AND BOUGHT THE YOGA TAPE BY DENISE CALLED YOGA BUNS. I DO IT WENT I DON'T HAVE A FULL HOUR TO DO THE FAT BLASTING VIDEO. THANKS DENISE FOR MAKING ME SEE HOW GREAT YOGA IS. IT IS THE MOST REFRESHING WORK OUT I'VE EVER DONE AND I FEEL STRONG ALL OVER.",1062720000,4,703,3.7248322147651005
1810446,5,B00007GZPE,"Some people love Denise Austin and some, as I've read hate her.  I am in the former camp...even being someone who loves traditional yoga.
I have two of Denise's yoga tapes and I love them both.  Out of all my yoga tapes (about 20 or so) I consistently go back to hers again and again. Why?  Because I notice when I do hers I feel good immediately.  Time-wise her workouts are very effective because she doesn't have long pauses in between poses. When I need a break...I simply take it on my own and carry on.  I just feel wonderful after her work outs.
Her talking doesn't bother me and to me, she just seems nice and very positive.  I think she really does enjoy helping others improve their lives with fitness.
Denise, if you are reading this...it would be great if you made more yoga videos!  Thanks!",1060646400,5,803,4.385135135135135
1810447,4,B00007GZPE,"Although I find Denise Austin's voice extremely annoying, this Fat-Blasting Yoga video really works.  I love the low-impact full body workout that I get everytime I use the video.  Even after the very first workout, I could feel the difference, and after 4 workouts, I could SEE the difference.  What I like most is that it's easy, and produces results.  And for that, I can deal with the annoying voice and UGLY facial expressions of Denise Austin.",1060560000,2,449,4.792207792207792
1810448,4,B00007GZPE,"Denise is one of those unique fitness gurus.  You either love her or hate her.  I happen to think she is great and a real motivator and this is only the 2nd DVD I've bought from her.  This DVD is a great workout.  I have studied other forms of Yoga and while purists will scream this isn't yoga, it's Denise taking traditional forms of yoga and blasting it up.
She begins the video with a good warm up before she goes into the Yoga Aerobic Conditioning section.  In this section, you do one traditional yoga pose then she modifies and speeds it up adding extra movements for a flat blasting routine.  Poses such as Warrior, Balancing Stick, and Tree are modified effectively here to give you a good workout (it will make you sweat!).
The second section is Strength training with yoga postures.  This section can be tough as you hold a lot of postures with your weight for periods of time but is all around ok.
Be forwarned, for the 3rd and final section, the ""core"" section you will need a Stability Ball.  I bought a ball but maybe mine is too big I'm not sure as this section always gives me problems.  I also haven't had much ball use and find this very tough, but not unenjoyable.
Overall it's a good yoga based workout, decent music, and Austin is very motivational and informational through the work out.  Not bad, but not perfect.  Typical Denise and that's not a bad thing!",1057968000,5,1381,4.440476190476191
1810449,5,B00007GZPE,"I absolutely LOVE this workout! I have read some of the other reviews and here is my opinion: it is fast paced but very easy to follow, I never noticed the music, and the poses are not that advanced (I have never done yoga). I had reservations about buying this tape because Denise Austin is not my favorite workout guru....but WOW!!! Did she ever suprise me? This workout is fun and I look forward to doing it everyday. You will be sore the next day, but not to where you can't move and do your day to day tasks. It is a good sore, like you know you're muscles are being worked. It is also a very good stretching tape. I lost all my flexibility during my pregnancy last year, and this has helped a great deal. I also had reservations about a workout that promised a yoga body in 21 days, but again, I was pleasantly suprised. I have been using the tape 4 days a week for 3 weeks now and I can actually SEE a difference. My thighs and butt have NEVER been this firm. It truly is ""Fat-Blasting Yoga.""",1055808000,17,999,4.181347150259067
1810450,5,B00007GZPE,"This is a great video ! I honestly HATE working out, but I LOVE yoga. I already had a wonderful yoga video, but it was too long of a work out to fit into my schedule. I like the way this one is broken up into 3 short workouts. I like the way Denise keeps her moves simple, but effective. This video is EXCELLENT for your back. You feel pain free and thoroughly stretched after these workouts. I think Denise Austin is a sincerely sweet and motivating person. I recommend her videos to anyone who wants a realistic workout that you can stick with. As far as the stability ball, a large kids' ball works great.",1049328000,55,608,4.25
1810451,5,B00007GZPE,"I am a beginner to intermediate exerciser, this was my first attempt at yoga, This is so much fun!! I feel so great at the end of this workout, streched out and relaxed, I did not have any real trouble keeping up though I do have some work to do on balance, I love the fast pace, anything slower would just be boring, and I love that nice slightly sore feeling my muscles get the following day, (after doing the video 4 times I can already feel great improvement in my balance and flexability). I was really impressed that the first segments worked up such a sweat, I never thought of Yoga as a cardio, but at a beginner to imtermediate level this could be a rotation for a light cardio day, I usually do this as a second workout late in the day and it is wonderful!! You can break this up into 3 different workouts but I find that once I get started I have so much fun and the time passes so quickly that I end up doing the whole tape!!

1810452,4,B00007GZPE,"I have the Denise Austin Power Yoga Plus, which is two twenty minute excercises, based on Pilates and Yoga.  They are fairly easy, and give you a nice stretched feeling.  I also have Denise's Blast Away 10 Pounds, which is a bit harder, and includes lots of high intesity aerobics.  This video fell right in the middle - lots of good stretches and movements, but a little fat burning aerobic activity thrown in.  It is not traditional yoga, but that is not what you usually look for in a workout video - you look for that extra twist.  And Denise provides that.  She's also way bubbly, but in a sweet, supportive way.",1047945600,7,617,4.464285714285714

If you're new to yoga, you may want to try a beginners yoga video and get used to the poses as well as learn the poses by name because Denise really moves through them in this video!  It is great workout and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves yoga and wants to break a sweat.  You definitely feel results after your first work out.  It's also great how the video is split into 3 parts for the days you are running low on time.  One little note, the 3rd part requires a stability ball for best results. Happy exercising!! :)",1044403200,10,640,4.162601626016261
1810454,4,B00007GZPE,"As an experienced intermediate exerciser, this workout was a little something different.  It begins with a faster-paced 30 minute yoga workout that does increase your heart rate a little and challenges your muscles.  Sometimes however, the faster pace interupts the usual flow that yoga has, and you kind of stumble into the moves the first few times.  For safety I recommend practicing the moves by pausing the vcr throughout the first section the first time using it.  Honestly, I do wish Denise held the stretches longer.  I can feel the strength and flexibility benefits though, and after the first time, I had a mild soreness the next day to show I'd challenged my muscles, but no lasting pain of any kind.  The second workout on the tape is a 15 minute strength and flexibility workout,  where poses are challenging and held longer.  It challenges the arms as well, which is good, to provide balance since the first workout used mainly the lower body muscles.  The tape also includes a workout for abdominals and total body conditioning, which recommends a ""stability ball"", this portion gives your abdominals and back a good workout.  All in all, this video can add something different to your workout routine, once you get used to the rushed pacing.",1043452800,7,1257,4.886792452830188

I love to do it while I travel (which is why I wanted the streaming version), to ease me out and keep me moving after sitting for a long time on airplanes, cars, whatever. It also tones me, but after a back injury, I'm more concerned with flexibility and balance than body tone. This workout gives you all 3.
