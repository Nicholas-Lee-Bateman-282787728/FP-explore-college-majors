8676199,5,B00N47NO22,"While Republic Studios was and still is the king of serials made from the thirties through the early fifties, Universal Studios certainly was the king of the technicolor adventure B movies. ""Yankee Buccaneer"" is a rousingly good adventure. The technicolor is amazing and the movie brought back memories of Saturday nights at the Drive Ins with the family for this aging Baby Boomer. The cast was great. Anything that Jeff Chandler was in was a treat. It was nice seeing the ill fated Susan Ball, who was a well established B movie actress. Unfortunately Ms. Ball met an untimely death at the hands of her son.",1433376000,3,609,4.754716981132075
