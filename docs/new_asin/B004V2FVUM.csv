As the Police Inspector he is corrupt so that he can get close to the baddies of the city and then controls them as Shenshaah. Like the usual Superman movie, there is a heroine who loves Shenshaah not Vijay. And in the typical fashion as in SUperman movies, evil is finished at the end. Here the villain played by Amrish Puri is hanged inside the courtroom by Shenshaah. Shenshaah played by Amitabh Bachchan; this is one of his memorable roles ever. Meenakshi Shesadri plays the love interest of Shenshaah. Rohini Hattangadi plays the role of Vijay's mother. She has done justice to her role.",1306281600,,845,4.522875816993464
