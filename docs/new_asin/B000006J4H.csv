1194765,5,B000006J4H,"This Korean film by director Kim Sung Soo is a visionary masterpiece that brings to mind ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator.""
It takes place in ancient China, where Korean missionaries are betrayed by the Chinese and are taken into the desert to die. The Mongol hordes annihilate the Chinese guards and leave the Koreans to their fate. While wandering, the Koreans discover the Mongols have kidnapped the Chinese princess, and decide to rescue her and take her to safety. This is easier said than done, for the Mongols fight back with all the ferocity in their blood.
Zhang Ziyi is the most known star in this film, but she is hardly the main character. There and great performances by Jung Woo Sung as a quiet loner and Ahn Sung Ki, the skilled archer who gives Legolas a run for his money.
The scenery filmed in China and parts of South Korea is grand, and the battle scenes are filmed with finesse and brutality. Limbs are hacked off, arrows puncture necks, and heads are severed. This film is somewhat gory, so be warned.
This film was the biggest budgeted Korean film in history at the time of its release, and it was a box office hit in South Korea. It is a wonder why this film was never released commercially in the States, when it is on par if not far superior, to the films made in Hollywood. The DVD has some great extras in the 2-Disc edition, and I highly recommend this film to fans of Braveheart, Gladiator, and other epic sagas.",1063497600,36,1437,4.530769230769231

1194872,5,B000006J4H,"This is a Korean, epic movie filmed in the desert. In 'The Warrior' there are no huge battlions taking each other on or lots of high skilled martial arts; however, there are action and fighting scenes that are nicely filmed. There are slow parts, but I really didn't get too bored. The story has a human side but also good sequences of action. I felt the violence in the movie did not seem quite as harsh as many reviews have stated. Neither do I have a problem with the older, ambient sounding score. There's mostly flutes and drums playing. So it does not ruin the movie at all.

Furthermore, if you thought 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' was a good epic, then you might love 'Musa: The Warrior'. It's an older film, but it's a classic. The acting is pretty good, the camera work is good, and Sony did a nice job with the video. Also, I really liked the cast with Yu Rong Guang as the Mongolian general. Zhang Zi Yi plays the Ming princess, and I actually thought she was better here than as a Ching princess in Crouching Tiger.

In a short description of the story, it's about a delegation of Korean Koryo soldiers who are sent to make peace with the new Chinese Ming government. They are eventially put in a situation where they are fighting for survival and are at odds against the remnant Yuan leadership.

The features on the DVD have trailers of the film and several other Sony releases. There is no making of featurette. Also, the original language sound track and english dub are available.",1376265600,,1502,4.514705882352941
1194873,5,B000006J4H,"THE WARRIOR

Have you ever seen a movie that some one else introduced you to and you realize it is one that you should have know about on your own? Well that is the case with this film here titled ""Musa"" also know here in the States as ""The Warrior"". If you were to look at my collection you would have thought I owned this but it was brought into my collection after she showed it to me. What makes this even better is it is based on historical facts, not entirely of course but it is based on some real events.

The film was also actually the biggest release in Korean cinema history at the time, with the largest budget at the time as well. It is also one of the best films I have seen that really tried to make even the settings and props as historically accurate as well. Plus I do recommend that you do not watch it the first go round with the English dud. As with all these kinds of films it is much better in the languages they were filmed. Also if you can find it get the Korean cut of the film, the international is just as good if that is all you can find but it is shorter by almost 30 minutes I believe.

A Korean envoy is making their way home when they are ambushed and attacked by the Chinese, a theme that repeats itself a couple different times. They are arrested under the suspicion that they are spies. Once again they are attacked while prisoners this time by the Mongols but are released to survive on their own. While they were making their way through China they happen upon a captured Chinese princess, and decide that they need to rescue her. They see this as their way of getting in the good graces of her people and connecting their two peoples together. In doing so they are only making matters worse for themselves as it turns out. On top of that they pick up a Monk along the way and a former slave seems to be the most skilled of the group. That of course causes tension between him and the General of the Korean group.

Writer/director Kim Seong-soo does a great job with this film and makes it very entertaining throughout. He did a great job making this as realistic as possible and still incorporating very entertaining moments and action. The battles feel real and are very well done which makes for a great movie. Ziyi Zhang or Zhang Ziyi depending is great as Princess Bu-yong, but of course we knew she would be. Woo-sung Jung is excellent as the former slave of an ambassador who is now a free man, well unless you ask the General. Speaking of the general Ju Jin-mo is great in the role and the way he plays off of Jung's character and vice versa is great. These three really are excellent in this film.

Of course the entire cast is great like Ahn Sung-ki whose character is looked up to amongst the others is great as well. Yu Rongguang plays the Mongol general and does a great job as well. Now like I said earlier the action scenes and battles are great because they are treated seriously. I also enjoyed the setting the story takes place in since it really feels like they have a long way to go. That of course leads me into the cinematography which as is the case with most of these films is great. The scope and wide shots really add to the emptiness of the desert that they are in.

This is a good movie fro sure and if you are into these types of films then you will love it. It is not only an epic movie but it has adventure and love stories woven in as well. Like the former slave and general competing for the princess, so much so that they even do battle from time to time. This really is a good movie and while not the greatest I have ever seen it is still recommendable.",1307836800,2,3626,4.217579250720461
1194874,5,B000006J4H,"It is a film that has all the expected qualities: great action scenes, brave heroes, and love interest.  What makes this film unique and mysterious is the main character himself.  Everything in your gut says he is a good man, both from your experience of films knowing that he must be a good guy if the film is about him, and his devotion to his master.  But still, lying underneath that calm demeanor there is a distillness, of which, I believe, even he did not understand it's true root until the end of the film.  Without the actor's ability to portray such mystery, the film would have only been average.",1307059200,,608,4.5
1194925,1,B000006J4H,"I don't usually write reviews, but I saw so many positive reviews that I had to write this...

This movie is painful to watch. The characters are one dimensional and as some of them die you are actually relieved that you do not have to suffer through the actors' performances any longer. The music is awful! Imagine a really bad action movie from the 1970's...yeah, that really bad one that was recycled from the depths of B action movie hell circa 1976 and played on TV late at night in the early 1980's...that is what this movie sounds like.

The only good part of this movie is the costume design.

I don't want to waste any more time writing about this crap movie other than to warn everyone...don't waste your money!!!",1280361600,2,723,4.5038167938931295
1194926,5,B000006J4H,"I really don't know where to begin.

(possible spoilers ahead)

When I first saw this movie, I could only see how arrogant the Korean general was.  Then later, I realized how our social class (in this case, the Korean society in 14th century) awareness has made him that way.  In the desert, the social class differences didn't matter as much as before, but almost unconsciously, everyone carried out their specific role and followed it.  As the movie progressed, many characters (and the viewers) could clearly see that the system of assigned roles was flawed.

It pondered me how the princess, who was utterly selfish when it came down to persuasion of her interests, (like when she handed her fine yellow silk robe to another girl so that the girl could act as a bait) was kowtowed at when the villagers saw her.  Yet she also was true to her feeling when she gave a piece of cloth to a slave which clearly meant a lot to him.  The general saw the slave in a negative light due to slave's recent acquisition of his freedom from his deceased master (the general says about this: ""Once slave you are forever slave. That is the law of Koryo"").  But when Yesol (the slave) is captured by the enemies, the general becomes worried as much as anyone else.  And Yesol, (oh boy, what a great character!), although freed, he could not escape his duties to the family of his previous master, and when captured, Yesol was offered honor, prestige, and wealth had he joined the Mongols, but instead Yesol comes back (to a place where he could still go back as a slave if everything resolves) to fight with his travel companions, then he saves the life of the princess at cost of his.  Previously, before the final battle began, the general said something akin to: ""the greatest honor of a warrior is to die in a battle"", but when he is dying, he sees no honor and purpose of such death, and dies sad and disappointed.

So what is the whole point of me telling you all this?  It seems that all the characters in this movie has some flaws, but not due to their erroneous choices, but as the victims of their acquired perspective through the experiences of this world. Notice, when they made the right choices, it is due to following their ""true feeling"" rather than following how things are supposed to work out in this world.  Yes, I just indirectly said that this movie makes a good case of destiny affecting more than our choices to our life in this world.

So what is the movie trying to tell us?  Maybe the more ""noble purpose"" we humans think we have, the more we tend to become arrogant and wrong, and we provably won't notice it until the end of our lives.  Yesol, who was only a slave, who could not even properly understand freedom, ultimately died in the most fulfilling way, by showing what his love was capable of, unlike the general who had loftier ideals like (superficial) honor, which it ultimately bounded him and made him less free,  making him a less humane being.  Notice that I only talked about 3 characters in the movie, but there are more, and you will see how each finds their own truths (particularly pay attention to the archer guy, although he is almost like an observer).

If you really want to understand this film, you have to be an active viewer like the reviewer below suggested.  Keep looking at each character's faces and their expressions; if you do, I can promise you one of the most awarding film experiences.

The only flaw of this movie is that Koreans fought rather too well; but then, same happens to Americans with their own films.  I guess no one can escape the delusion of self-appointing protagonist mentality.",1251331200,7,3644,4.5552147239263805
1194927,5,B000006J4H,"This movie is by far my favorite Asian film, for a few reasons. Firstly, I'm not a big fan of the ""super powers"" martial arts films where everyone can practically fly; I prefer the films where I can at least pretend what the characters are doing is doable. ;) This film is heavy on action, but not ""super power"" action.

Secondly, and more importantly, the film is beautifully and artistically crafted. At points, the brilliance and subtly of the character expressions, interactions and behaviors are so stunning that you feel more like you're watching visual poetry than a film. That is where this film's true depth and stunning quality lies.

This is not an over-the-top Hollywood film, with big, flamboyantly expressed interactions and emotions; this is a subtler, more realistic and beautiful film. I wouldn't recommend watching this film if you're a ""passive viewer"" who prefers that things are shouted out, loud and clear; I would highly recommend this film if you're an ""active viewer"", who likes to engage with the story as you watch, picking up the subtle visual and audio cues to understand what you're seeing. If you like to see, hear, deduce, and feel what the characters are thinking and feeling, this is the film for you; if you like to be told in clear, uncertain terms, probably not.

That's what I really love about this film...it's the little things, a fleeting expression, an inflected tone, that tell the human bits of this story...as I say, visual poetry.

As for the rest, it is all very good too. The story is solid, the acting great, and the direction very good. It's a bit on the long side, so keep that in mind when you're viewing it. If you're like me, though, you won't even notice, and you'll be sorry when it's over.

5/5 stars",1250812800,3,1757,4.710097719869707
1194928,2,B000006J4H,"Before I write this somewhat of a downer, I want to say that I bought this movie based on the solid reviews it received here on Amazon.  However, I have come to believe that some of these (especially the 5 STARS) were written by people who were paid to write for the movie.  Being such a ""high budget"" film in Korea, it looked and had the feel of a really low budget film for all the scenes being outside and the props being pretty awful.

The Warrior takes place in 1375AD China.  Korea has sent troops to make peace with China's new government but are exiled to the desert.  After what seems like an eternity into the movie, Zhang Ziyi finally enters the film.  The plot is really drawn out and confusing.  The translations, which were very accurate, show how poorly the script was written.  IF you like endless movie-type cliches and a poor choice of words, you may disagree with the previous statement.

The acting was sub-par and the only redeeming factor for this movie was Jung Woo-Sung's character.  However, even he is not very entertaining to watch.  Zhang Ziyi's acting was pretty awful and, well, I guess she is playing the same character as in every ancient-based Chinese movie that she always plays...  Another annoying character is this Buddhist monk who happens to meet the Koreans and then follows the Korean general.  He is just one of many characters this movie could have done without.

As mentioned before, the plot is very drawn out and muddled.  I couldn't quite follow the movie and I truly didn't enjoy the acting.

As far as the actual cinematic production of the movie is concerned, the shots are all OKAY.  I put heavy emphasis on okay because Korean and Chinese martial arts movies [EDIT: Korean War Epic, not martial arts movie] usually have a certain feel to them and a beauty in all of the shots.  These scenes seemed poorly planned out and the directors eye didn't capture much of the natural beauty form the areas this movie was filmed.

The soundtrack was annoying and cliche to any cheesy 70's American made action/martial arts movie with heavy staccato's during the dreadful moments.

Overall, I would say that this movie was below average in the areas of Cinematography, Acting, Writing, Script and Soundtrack.  I feel like one of the only reasons this movie ever got watched is because Zhang Ziyi was casted, but she even helps ruin this movie at points.

Sorry for this negative review but I was really upset after reading the amazing reviews and paying for the movie.  Not even worth the used price of $3.76+shipping.

Recommendations based on this movie's attributes: All of which are better than ""The Warrior"".

Korean- Sword in the Moon (One of the best Korean martial arts movies I have ever watched), Crying Fist, Oldboy (Similar only in the graphic nature), Tae Guk Gi (Also has poor dialogue, but well-done), The Duelist.

Chinese- The Warlords, Curse of the Golden Flower (A little confusing, but easy enough to follow. Beautifully shot.), Hero (Another beautifully shot movie.), Fearless, Crouching Tiger (Classic), The Promise (the writing is very similar to the Warrior, not much to help you stay involved, but entertaining nonetheless.)",1234569600,9,3189,4.8161764705882355
1194929,5,B000006J4H,"This is a great movie.  I actually have the original Korean DVD.  Be warned, American marketing would like you to think Zhang Xiyi is going to give you some great fights with that Photoshopped sword in her hand.  In this movie, she is a princess, she isn't a wushu fighter.  The characters, story, acting, and fight sequences are exciting, but not ""wire-fu"".  I truly hate it when companies superimpose heads on different bodies and put weapons in actor's hands when it is not reflective of the movie.  The result, you sucker someone into buying a movie expecting something of which the cover speaks otherwise.  That in itself is false advertising.  But if you are interested in seeing a good movie, watch this movie (originally called Musa: the Warrior).  This isn't ""crouching tiger"", it's more of a gritty historic epic and worth watching!",1230508800,7,842,4.873239436619718
1194930,4,B000006J4H,"If you've read any of my reviews of other recent martial arts films, you know that I enjoyed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but generally found myself unimpressed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warriors-of-Heaven-and-Earth/dp/B000683VH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warriors of Heaven and Earth</a>. I was downright confused by the plot of Zu Warriors, though it had a few relatively cool moments and special effects.

The Warrior (I think ""Musa the Warrior"" is an alternate version of the film with different audio tracks?) falls somewhere between the extremes.

The film is shot with a lot of emphasis on sepia tone (earth tones). So, in that regard it's a bit unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon/dp/B00003CXR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curse-of-the-Golden-Flower/dp/B000MRA592/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curse of the Golden Flower</a>, and other movies of what I'd call Asian ""art house"" cinema.

But, whereas Warriors of Heaven and Earth seemed singularly unimpressive in its fight scenes and a bit depressing in its sepia tone desert scenes, The Warrior seemed to keep things more lively. It had a lot of pretty good, interesting fights (if overly violent / bloody in a few cases). I actually found myself empathizing with the characters, and caring what happened to them. [WARNING: Slight spoiler ahead] The movie was a period martial arts / drama piece about a Korean diplomatic envoy to China that was captured, escaped, and ended up trying to save a princess intended for the Ming emperor, in order to restore relations between China and Korea. It's too bad that all or most of the characters inevitably died off in the course of the movie.

I thought the movie came off quite well, despite not being as colorful or artsy as other movies in the genre. The fight scenes were good, the plot was a bit above marginally interesting (it kept my attention more than Warriors of Heaven and Earth). The grittiness was interesting, though sometimes a bit overwhelming with all the various killing going on in the process of trying to get the princess safely to the Ming emperor...

The titular character was actually rather interesting insofar as he was a bit dark and mysterious. In some ways, the character was extremely feral. It reminded me a lot of Jet Li's performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unleashed/dp/B000A2IPQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unleashed</a>. Essentially, both were slaves, trained to be extremely fierce fighters, but inevitably found their freedom (though in many respects didn't know what to do with it, once they had it).

If you're expecting Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Monkey/dp/B00005V1Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Monkey</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fearless/dp/B000K2UW06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fearless</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hero/dp/B00030590I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hero</a>&nbsp;type art direction and costuming, don't. It's quite muted in terms of the color schemes, often opting for sepia; there's not much by the way of colorful artistry. But it also suits the mood of the movie, which is quite grim and gritty.

In all, I rather enjoyed the movie. Certainly more than Warriors of Heaven and Earth or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Butterfly-Sword/dp/B00022PZJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Butterfly Sword</a>, neither of which I cared for; nor would I especially recommend them (unless you've seen EVERYthing else and are bored, or need to cure insomnia).

Curse of the Golden Flower,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Myth/dp/B000UNYK3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Myth</a>, House of Flying Daggers are all pretty good flicks.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-the-Black-Scorpion/dp/B00104AYGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of the Black Scorpion</a>&nbsp;is quite good too, though a rather bloody retelling of Macbeth.

So, if you're into really artsy colorful flicks, try the above. If you're into a pretty gritty movie with lots of interesting fight sequences (if a bit bloody), The Warrior is pretty good martial arts fare.",1218240000,2,4609,7.029668411867365
1194931,4,B000006J4H,"I had no expectations going into this film. My wife, who teaches Ancient History, got it and I wasn't enthusiastic about watching it. However, I was in for a surprise from the opening shot. The cinematography is excellent, the locations exotic, and the storyline is realistic and believable. All of the sub-plots detailing personal conflicts were true to character and followed logically, and sustained what was essentially a very traditional tale of mistaken identity followed by a very long chase.

I apprecated the fact that no effort is made to explain the extraordinary martial skills of Yeo-sol, he remains a mystery, although his character is fascinating. Also the Mongol General: Rambulwha was a very interesting figure, as was Jin-lip the archer, and even Ji-san the monk--interesting to see what it took to bring this quiet man of dignity to a homicidal rage. Even the lesser characters are carefully defined. This attention to detail was impressive and unusual in an action film. The final predicament reminded me so much of the Alamo, and when the Princess confesses her reasons for causing the whole imbroglio, and it's effervescent insignificance in the face of the blood, sweat and tears of those attempting to defend her, it's a devastating irony. The climax has a truly lyrical, haunting quality about it.

This is a deeply romantic, and very graphic, war story--yet it is appealing for the reasons I listed previously, as an interesting collection of character studies. Yeo-sol, the slave, who was the most liberated man of the bunch, is a phenomenon to watch. He moves with such, grace, style, and elan it is hard not to be wowed. One extra kudo for keeping the story realistic. Far too often in Chinese martial films the tendency to drift off in to Magic Realism is irresistable--but, to this viewer, is very annoying. The Warrior stayed ultra realistic--and I appreciated that--it is one of the aspects that I have always loved about most Japanese Sword films(well not Lone Wolf and Cub). One final note: when I first heard the title of the film as Musa--I asked, what does a historical drama have to do with Bananas? I thought they meant one of three genera in the family Musaceae; it includes bananas and plantains...",1217808000,3,2240,4.954787234042553
1194932,4,B000006J4H,"I love this movie.  Korea has a great sense of dramatic action.  They can be serious with beautiful style in their action sequences.  This is a fictional story inspired by a historical setting.  If you were moved by LOTR: The Two Towers with the story of warriors leading people away from the enemy to a place of safety where the stand for all you believe in will take place...then this is a good story for you.  If you are not familiar with Cowboy/Western flms or Eastern Warrior stories then this may feel unfamiliar or slow.

The cover is angering me because it is very missleading because they want someone passing by the ""Martial Arts"" DVD section to pick it up.  Miss Ziyi is not a warrior in this film.  Her being the popular Chinese actress for American audiences associated her with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Rush Hour 2 or House Of Flying Daggers expect her to be fighting always.  NOPE. So her holding a sword so bravely on a DVD cover is false to her character. (especially with the movie being called The Warrior)  She plays a bratty yet beautiful princess who has never stepped out into the real world in her life.  Woo-Sung Jung's character does not use a sword. He fights with a spear throughout the film.  If anything else he uses against an enemy was a horse whip.  The importance of swords I guess comes from a history of cool characters of fantasy or period films using swords.  Bad guys or second characters use the axe and that is rare.  Everything else would suck I guess.  Now the picture of these two actors are from posters & photos used in promotion for the film...but those hands were photoshoped poorly into the cover.  Woo-Sung looks like he is leaning over a sink ready to brush his teeth with that thing.

In conclusion, type in Musa for a dvd search of this film and you may be lucky to find on sale the Tai Seng release of this film titled Musa (translates to Warrior).  The quality is equal to this release.  I was lucky to get the Tai Seng release but then this one came out and for some reason the Tai Seng release is hard to find. I guess its not in print.  So if you can't find the tai Seng release then buy this one because the movie is good even though the DVD cover is lame.  Its just a lame cover like the domestic release of infernal affairs with some random Chinese woman dressed up like a Bond chick with a gun...whaaat?

It is discovered the Mongolians of the Yuan dynasty have a royal prisoner, the Princess of the Ming dynasty. Undetected by her captors, she skillfully drops a handkerchief with a message written in blood which Yoso manages to retrieve. The Koreans see an opportunity to prove their worthiness to the Ming Dynasty. They create a distraction and capture the Princess. Yeosol demonstrates great heroism in his daring efforts to fight the Mongolians and save the Princess.

Primarily, the film is about how the Koryo (the group of Korean warriors) evade the Yuans or engage them in battle - all this on behalf of the royal prisoner whom they saved ... and among the Koryo, Yeosol proves to be a rare and most courageous fighter. There are realistic fight scenes which are well within the context of the film but may be too gruesome and gorry for some viewers. Yeosol, the freed slave proves invaluable to the Koreans. His fighting skills far exceed those of any other soldier among the Korean warriors. However, General Choi continues to view him as a slave by the Korean laws ... despite his Master having provided him freedom. The Koreans plan to get to a river which they will cross to get to Nanching. Unfortunately, the Mongolians thwart their efforts by killing nearly everyone in the villages which are located on the river. Surviving villagers join the Koreans as they march on thorugh forests to protect their lives from the invaders. They are awed by the fact they are protecting the Princess of the Ming dynsasty.

Sadly, the Mongolians continue to advance and battle with the diminishing group of survivors. The remaining villagers and Korean warriors make it to a river embankment where a Ming fortress becomes their shelter. Unfortunately, the Mongolians create a camp on a nearby hill top, planning an invasion. The courage of the villagers and Korean warriors in fighting the Mongolians is awe-inspiring ... It becomes a battle to the end.

The intersecting story line of three groups of warriors, the Ming, the Yuan, and the Koryo (Korean warriors) who fight to save the royal captor sounds like a simple story ... but it is not. There are complex subplots which are subtley revealed as the story unfolds before the viewer's eyes. There are hidden nuances and underlying depths - revealed by the camera. The camera captures short views of faces showing emotional depth and meaning, especially between Yeosol, the former slave and Princess, Bu-Yong. The camera hones in on fight scenes between individuals in a manner which makes the viewer feel as if they were actually there. The amazing capability of the Koreans to capture the Ming Princess and protect her is worth viewing. They march through unknown territory against a menacing enemy. The battle for life is revealed in unimaginable ways. The loyalty of the villagers and the dedication and perseverance of the Korean warriors ... is very inspiring. One learns so much about the human spirit and courage in a film like this. One also learns how hierarchy and politics affect the soldier and common man alike. At one point, the Princess was willing to give herself up to the enemy, the Mongolians, when she recognized how many lives were sacrificed on her behalf. She saw how many had died so she may be protected and live. It is quite a revelelation to discover how she was captured in the first place by the Yuans, the Mongolians. This is superbly filmed war epic which depicts extraordinairy cultural reality. It is most highly recommended. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1185926400,5,4626,4.793233082706767

I'm not necessarily asking for a big budget martial arts epic, but this was not good. The english dubbed is amusingly bad. I do think part of the soundtrack was dropped.

1194990,4,B000006J4H,"Musa is about a band of koreans on a diplomatic mission in China that goes array. After being exiled into the desert they run into a captured princess. She promises them a boat if they deliver her home, and the koreans reason if they save her they can return to their own home victorious. There are several complex emotions that come into play. The Korean leader is full of self doubt and is also competing for the attention of the princess against a slave. The Koreans are resentful of said princess, blaming all of their woes on her. The princess herself is determined to maintain status and composure, however the deaths of her people and the Koreans began to take its toll. Musa is a grand epic, based on the simple desire to see one's home again. The battle scenes are well shot, and action does not let up. The final battle is especially good, focusing on the sacrifices and the bonds that the Koreans have made with the Hans. Musa means warrior, and the movie does not focus so much on just one, but all of them. When the inevitable happens it is enough to bring tears to even the most hardened eyes.",1148515200,,1107,4.431372549019608
1194991,3,B000006J4H,"This historical Korean War epic takes place during the first year of the Korean Woo Dynasty, the Yuan(Mongol Khan)Empire and the Ming Dynasty around 1375AD. A Korean diplomatic expedition is sent to reestablish peaceful political relations with the Ming dynasty. But they find themselves mislead by Ming representatives and never make it the chinese capital to fulfill their mission. They are then treated like criminals or enemies of the state and  they are escorted by Ming guards as prisoners to the desert until they are attacked by the Mongols. The Mongols in essense have no quarrel with the Koreans and leave them to their peril to survive the desert. The characters seems to develop at this point with plenty of realistic action here and throughout the film. It has the feel of 'Gladiator' but without the intense drama, development and interaction between the main characters. They are the spoiled brat myopic general, the solemn and free slave who is a well skilled talented martial artist, the practical strategist and noblisse obliged wise sergeant officer, the Ming Princess who is level headed portrays herself as royalty that cares for her people and the Mongol General sent in pursuit to recover the princess to use her as bargaining chip for the sister of the Mongol leader with the Ming King. The film plot sacrifices an interesting epic story that could be deeper in dialogue and character development for prolonged detailed battled scenes. The mystical but talented Warrior free-slave YeoSung is the central hero for this story for which the film is named. He is respected by the enemy Mongol General, despised by the Korean General and is trusted as the personal bodyguard by the Ming Princess, who seems to have romantic thoughts as a reward for his duties if they survive the chase. But that thought is only potrayed through the fine acting of Ziyi Zhang.

This is not a martial arts film, so the story that the film is trying to tell misses its mark at scoring hugely in the international market because it lack drama and character development. For example 'Hero'with Jet Li was based on the King Qin the first king of the Chinese Empire which developed the characters who interacted in the story beautifully and had drama while at the same time displaying excellent martial arts. A well told story has a good plot, excellent drama and character development. The characters in this film never draw you into the story. So the true meaning of a potentially fantastic story is lost making it unmemoriable. But I have to say that the battle scenes were of epic purportions that Hollywood should take a cue on. They are realistic and brutal the way a war film should be especially during this time period. If you are into this type of film I would suggest that you watch 'The Emperor and the Assassin' which basically tells the same story as 'Hero' but it is of epic purportions with brutality on the battlefield as well as, in the kings court like you will never see it. It hits you in the gut harder and more times than the 'Warrior' or 'Hero' because of the combination of drama and some graphic scenes that draws you into the characters and the plot. It also has some good martial arts scenes that are realistic and quick as they would happen in the real world.

The difference between the films 'Warrior' and 'Musa,The Warrior' is it seems that the Sony version 'Warrior' has a cleaner digitized picture with English subtitles. 'Musa' has language in Korean and Chinese with Chinese and English subtitles along with better dolby surround. Other than that the English Dubbing(language voice over) seems that it was done by the same people that did the old language dubbing in the 70's and 80's for the Chinese Kung Fu flicks and the anime Japanese films. The voice dubbings could have more inflection for the scenes and characters but I guess they reflect the drama and out of budget minded accountants that are responsible to use it as an after thought by hiring anime voice dubbers. I'm sure this is not the last time that this story will be told on film. I just hope it is given more care in being told by a more colorful and dramatic story teller to make it unforgettable for all audiences.",1147132800,5,4217,4.758196721311475
1194992,5,B000006J4H,"This movie is a lot better than some of you people (who just want action and not historical drama) are giving it credit for. And this film is not going to intrigue you if you are someone with a short attention span who only hoped to rely on ""dumbed-down"" English dubbing.

I've rented both the American (Sony) release (with 5.1 English dubbing, and 2.0 Korean), and the Hong Kong original (Modern Audio International Ltd.) with NO English dubbing but well done English Subtitles. As well as the dubbing being 5.1 in both Korean and Cantonese.

A bad video transfer, reduced sound quality, and bad subtitles, can all contribute to making a movie undesirable.

So now, this is what everyone probably wants to know:

The Hong Kong original from Modern International Ltd (VED19104), is the one that you will want to buy. The video quality is excellent (sometimes it seems a little yellowed but the definition remains sharp) and the sound quality is in room-consuming 5.1 surround sound stereo in Korean and Cantonese.

The American release of this film from Sony is simply called ""The Warrior"".
The original title is ""Musa: The Warrior"".
Amazon, here, just calls this Modern International Ltd version ""Musa"".
But, the Modern DVD box does say ""Musa: The Warrior"".

I can tell on some of these reviews here, that some people have watched the Modern version and some have watched the Sony version. But praise consistently goes to the Modern International Ltd version.

Try this. Rent the Sony version first if you have to watch it with English dubbing. This may help some of you slower people (don't be ashamed) to understand the film, although much of its appeal and important intricate dialogue will be lost in that version. Then rent or buy the Modern version. All the film's true splendor will blow you away, and you'll just have to depend on subtitles to get you through it. But, it's worth it!

Plus, this Modern International version comes in a beautiful multi-fold box with some embossed Chinese print. Truly, a beautiful collector's item.

1195056,4,B000006J4H,"I learned of this movie through one of Amazon's suggestion linkups and decided to get it mostly because Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi is in it.

Set mostly in China a little over 600 years ago a Korean peace envoy is caught by the wrong side in a war between the Yuan and Ming factions.

Sent off into exile by the Yuan they gain their freedom when a Mongol band attacks, killing their captors. The surviving Koreans decide to try to make their way back home and along the way manage to rescue a Ming princess (Zhang Ziyi)held captive by another Mongol band. The Korean General has decided that by taking the princess to her home they might salvage their original mission as they return home.

They make their way to an abandoned fort pursued by the Mongols (who are working for the Yuan dynasty)taking with them a group of refugees from a village the Mongols attacked while looking for the Koreans and the princess. Both sides suffer heavy casualties but in the end the Koreans are victorious.

I guess this movie was filmed largely in the Gobi desert (no extras to tell you anything)sure was a bleak, hot looking place. The fort had the look of a real, abandoned, location (no exlanation of why someone had abandoned so many much needed weaponry)- the costuming looked great and even the battle sequences had a fairly realistic look to them. I was sometimes surprised by the amount of blood seen flying/pouring from wounds- you saw plenty of that sometimes. Not so directly the injury itself, except for arrows striking various parts of the body. I don't remember ever seeing so many horses taken down in battle, no idea if any actually were injured.

The movie seems a little long at times but it is worth seeing. Zhang Ziyi (House of FLying Daggers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) was the only ""name"" I recognized, she did a good job in her role but don't expect to see much action from her.

For languages in the film you can choose either Korean or Cantonese Chinese, the subtitling is in English or in Chinese- this is offered in either traditional or simplified Chinese. I found that in reading the English subtitling that there was an occaisional awkwardness that wouldn't be there if written by a native English speaker, the Chinese/English package notes had the same flaw (but not hard to follow along with).

I noticed in the production (the movie seems to be a joint Korean/ Chinese production) credits that most of it was in, I think Korean, with some parts in English. The music was done in part by some Japanese something or a Polish orchestra. I think some Australian firm even had a hand in the movie.

Along their way the Koreans rescue a Ming Chinese princess, Zhang Ziyi, and attempt to protect her and return her to the Court.

As action movies go ""Musa"" is above average. The movie was filmed in the desert and the cinematography is excellent, several characters are interesting, and Zhang Ziyi is a sensual female lead.

I got tired of the endless sword fights, especially the exploits of the spear-wielding ex-slave, Yeosol. As in too many action films his superhuman feats depend upon his opponents being dumb as dodos. The Mongols were famous in their day for archery.  Why didn't one of them just plug this guy with an arrow from one hundred yards away and be done with him?  Duuh.

A bit more romance would have helped the film.  Zhang Ziyi is a formidable beauty with real screen presence, but other than a few longing looks between her and Yeosol we are not offered much in the way of a love story.  Zhang's transformation from being a spoiled princess to a more mature and sympathetic character is one of the highlights as ""Musa"" bludgeons its way to a blood-soaked conclusion. ""Musa"" could have been a superb movie if there had been less emphasis on gore and more on themes such as forbidden love between a princess and an ex-slave.

This movie does not feature any wire effects or flying as is typical of the wuxia genre, as seen in crouching tiger, but has realistic fight and battle sequences, with some of the best fight sequences put on film.

1195109,4,B000006J4H,"This movie was such a pleasant supprise.  My brohter bought it without any knowledge of what he was getting.  it is deffinately one of the best action/epic asian films ever made.  if you are a fan of Kurosawa's works then this is the movie for you.  this film strongly reflects seven samuria all the way down to the cinematography of many of the battles, as kurosawa did this director uses lots of cuts to create a feeling of chaos, includeing tracking shots of horses feet as the stampede into battle.  if this movie has a weekness, it's the editing.  the movie opens with a brief, but great little min montage, then leads into the prologue.(this prologue is horribly translated, so what it means to say is something like""following the fall of Gangas Kahn two dynasties are formed, the yan, and the ming.  the yan is made up of many remain factions of gengas kahns army, and ming is the new true chines government.  in this strongle of dynasties the ming is wining.""  well that is the important stuff, the rest is on the back of the box)  this film has a great back drop with a wonderfully realistic feel to it.  the editing though is very rough in parts of the film, and give it a rushed feel, like the movie was not finished.

the action is very good, some will complian about the gore, well there is alot, but it gives the movie its rough feel that makes the who'll thing comprehendible.  the subtitles are pretty bad, they don't translate well, but you can get the jist of what is being siad, this is were the very subtle acting plays a inportant role.  the acting is pretty fabulous at times.  i really feel that the slave is a slave, he aviods eye contact and has a very submisive posture to him throughout the earlier portion of the film.  this is reflected in his fighting style, he seems to absorb everything around him through his periferal vision, he is used to never being able to make eye contact, and always looking at the floor, so he has develope the ability to really view the world without looking at it.  this is in my opinion one of the best portayals of a slave ever.  many would argue that his natural skill with his weapon is very unrealistic.  well if you pay attention to his style, it isn't so far feched, really the slave(yeosol) is a wonderfull character who comes through well because of the actor's attention to detial.  really much of this movie is criptic and needs alot of analyzing.  the only thing holding back this film is the editing.

the fighting in the begining of the film is very hard to follow, the editing is at time very random.  but the end battle makes it all worth it.  the last hour of the film is the best.  the characters of this film are well developed, their personalities are reflected in there weapons.  it is nice to see the variety of weaponry, this gives the diferent secondary characters a great feeling in combat.  really the character developement in this movie is really good, one of the best i've seen in a movie that tries to cover so much.  the vilian is a great villian, he is booth human and good.  this makes the troubles of the film that much more dynamic.  this is so much like a kurosawa movie in that so much is happening all the time, but if you aren't paying attention, nothing is happening.  the fight choreography is spectacular in the end of the film.  part of what makes the fighting so much fun is the different weapons, Axes, swords, bows, spears.  i viewed the movie with an eye for criticisim, and if you want to compian look at the bad editing, leave the rest of what is a criptic and great film alone.

ok so if you have been wiating to see another good epic film and you thought that troy and alexander didn't do it(that is a whole different story)  pick up this one, it's worth the money, plus it comes in a really cool case.

i watched half of the movie without subtitles and could totaly follow the film, except when the editing got stupid, it's realy that good, just make sure you understand the back story, other wise alot of this movie will bae lost on you.

alas there is so much i could say about this movie, but i'm not writing a paper on it now am i.  sorry for the bad vocaublary, and typos, i'm bad at grammer.",1102377600,4,4208,4.375
1195110,5,B000006J4H,"An Epic Saga like none Hollywood has put out in years(exception - The Last Samurai).  Won International awards in 2001, I believe.

Synopsis:  The story is fiction but has its basis in history.  Hundreds of years ago in China, the Ming Dynasty was established and they (the newly established Dynasty) were in the process of pushing the Mongols out of China.  Korea was attempting to establish diplomatic ties with the Ming Dynasty and had dispatched a total of four emissary groups to China.  Only three ever returned.  This is the story of that fourth group - the one that was never heard from again.  Features top acting from a top cast of Chinese and Korean actors including the star of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - Zhang Ziyi - the gem of China. She will steal your heart in the end.  Some of the best choreography, cinematography, story and acting of any film.  While it is filled with many battle scenes - they were all central to the story and very well done.  The movie involves Heroism, Love, Loyalty, Honor, Friendship and ultimately heart wrenching sacrifice all supplemented with beautiful music and scenery.  Themes that Hollywood seems to have forgotten except for the excellent movie: The Last Samurai.

Basic Story:  It starts with the last Emissary group arriving in China only to be accused of being spies and exiled to the Gobi desert.  While in transist, their captors are killed by a roving troup of Mongols and they are left to fend for themselves.  They later come across a seperate Mongol group that had captured a Chinese princess. The Koreans battle the Mongols, free the princess and attempt to return her to saftey in China.  The rest of the movie involves their hasty retreat across the desert with the Mongols close behind and climaxes in a final epic battle at a deserted fortress.  The many well played characters are brought to life and have you identifying with each - at times despising some, but ultimately loving them all.  The battle scenes are especially well done as the excellent musical score stirs your heart to heroic levels.  This movie sets itself apart from the often times clownish Kung Fu films that have the actors flying through the air while performing meaningless acrobatics - the fight choreography in Musa is very realistic and the actors highly skilled.  The name Musa means warrior.  Highly recommended - I am saving my copy for my son - when he is old enough to appreciate the meaning of Courage and Honor.",1102291200,4,2468,4.77122641509434

The story is lacking since all the conflict is over a selfish monarch's desire for freedom from her born-with-the-whole-country-at-her-feet-but-I'm-still-so-unhappy lifestyle. All the characters are very well portrayed and the cinematography is lavishing, however the action is sparse, the plot development was not developed enough and the high body count was unnecessary. Other downsides were the fly-by subtitles (which made it hard to absorb the film visually and understand what's going on at the same time. The subtitles flashed so quickly I had to rewind and pause various times), film length (the story could have been told in 1 hour instead of over 2 hours), and gore (how many times do I need to see a man shot in the neck with an arrow? I mean gore is fine but it can be more benificial to the film with more variety and imagination). Also the bulk of the film seemed like a feeble attempt at reenacting the Battle at Minas Tirath to the point that I wanted to watch the LotR: The Two Towers instead (who wouldn't. Lord of the Rings, now that's a masterpiece!). In a nutshell this was the little film that could but just couldn't get over that mountain.

1195112,5,B000006J4H,"I rented this movie just for the heck of it a little while ago, having an interest in Asian history (Though my main interest is in Japanese, not Korean history). Anyway...

This was a very lucid movie about a group of Korean diplomats who, exiled from their target country for treason, and unable to return home for shame, attempt to redeem themselves by saving a member of royalty from a group of Mongols. If all went well, they would be absolved of all charges of treason, and could therefore complete their mission. The situation gradually degenerates from a heroic rescue to a frantic battle for survival as the Mongols seek retribution for the intrusion into their affairs.

Contrary to what some claim, there actually IS some character development going on in this movie; it's just not what they're used to. Asians are a very subtle people, certainly not prone to the same habits and melodramatic emotional outbursts of your typical Western character. You can slowly, but surely see the growing resentment by the leader of the group at the weakening of his authority; the frustration of the head archer at the stubbornness of the leader; the despondency of the Mongol chieftan as he attempts to fulfill his duties-- duties for which he has neither heart nor interest. As far as the princess goes... yes, she was annoying. But then, she was supposed to be. Get over it! Even members of royalty have their quirks. Particularly royalty, actually. Some characters, admittedly, didn't make much sense; the movie still flows fairly smoothly, nonetheless.

Besides having an interesting plot and characters, the scenery is also beautiful. There's something particularly fitting about the desert; it's as if it will swallow everything whole. The movie was also well budgeted, so the camerawork and action sequences were very well done.

Finally, the movie concludes with a very nice battle sequence and the usual Asian flair for depression and gloominess.

Some problems:

Some of the scenes can drag on for quite some time. I didn't mind, but I'm aware that many people have almost zero patience.

The relationship between Yeosol and the princess is odd. I personally have trouble understanding it, though that's not all there is to the movie.

It is not a celebration of ""cultural diversity in our time,"" nor does it promote ""character building values for the youth of America."" Sorry, the main character is not arbitrarily black, and violence solves everything.

---

So... in conclusion, I love this movie. Some people might not love this movie. We are all entitled to our own opinions, and theirs is wrong. But seriously, if you don't like a little drama intermixed with your bloody, gory action, then don't buy this movie. Or at least rent it first.",1097971200,17,2753,4.952277657266811

1195143,5,B000006J4H,"as well as the beautifully choreographed fighting. The hero, Yeosol, knows he can never get the girl, but he does get her heart, and he knows it by halfway through the film. Pain, self-sacrifice and death are the consummation of his passion. The interaction between him and the princess is subtle - an indrawn breath, a shudder as he passes near her, her acceptance of his dominant posturing, and the climatic scene where she slaps him until he grabs her hand, refusing to let her go until she asks nicely, her hand relaxes in his (film convention weaving hands rather than bodies), he lets her go, and she runs off, leaving our invincible hero shaking and for a moment completely unmanned. Wonderful. How old are the pair? The script seems to suggest they're very young. The hero is a freed slave whose former master refers to him as a child or a boy. But the actor (Jung Woo-Sung) is in his thirties and, though he has an ageless beauty of face, he carries himself with authority, and in the film he casually kills men in a way that wouldn't be credible for a stripling (like the youth, Danseng, whom he takes under his wing - and on the DVD don't miss deleted scene six for a bit more there). The heroine is likewise very young, we might think, from her impetuous behaviour in running off from the stifling palace, thus (presumably) getting herself kidnapped and starting the whole tragic sequence of events. The tentativeness, but, at the same time, the frankness, of the two lovers' feelings for each other, in a situation where anything physical between them is totally impossible, would fit with extreme youth. Watch every flicker of the eye, every inclination of the body - this is all done with the utmost discretion, but if you realise that nobody else (like the Korean general, the other poor sap who falls in love with her) even dares to raise his eyes and look the princess in the face ... well, that will give you a baseline, and you can read the interactions in those terms, not in western ones. One thing that was frustrating about watching the film with subtitles was that I often didn't know whether people understood each other. Evidently some of the more senior Koreans do speak Chinese, but what about the hero? When he and the princess speak (or more often, yell) at each other, does either of them understand the other? Are they communicating entirely on a visceral level? I thought this film was as sexy as all get out. The battle scenes are harrowing, because the characters are believable and likeable, including the enemy general. The men on either side respect each other. They fight and die honourably, and it all ends up being uplifting somehow, despite the gore, as the one warm-hearted old campaigner (Jinlip) emerges from the carnage with his humanity unscathed, and the princess stands alone, a chastened and broken-hearted young girl. I think I'm going to cry ...",1092700800,4,2898,4.695481335952849

1195208,5,B000006J4H,"At the time of its domestic release, ""Musa-The Warrior"" was the most expensive film ever made in Korea, an ambitious epic that took five years to complete but paid off handsomely at the Korean box office.
Set in 14th Cent. Imperial China, after the Ming ousting of the Mongol Yuan dynasty, the film follows a band of Koryo warriors escorting a diplomatic missing from Korea in an increasingly hostile China. When the Ming have them arrested and exiled as spies, the warrior band find themselves outcasts in the hostile landscapes of the northern Chinese deserts, and caught in the crossfire between the Ming and Yuan forces.
Discovering that the Yuan have taken a ravishingly beautiful Ming princess prisoner, the band begin to see a way out of their desperate situation; if they can rescue her and return her safely home, they will both heal the rift with the Ming and  find themselves a way home to Korea.
Of course, things don't run quite as smoothly as planned, and the exhausted and gradually diminishing band of Koryo soldiers, led by a general beginning to doubt his own ability and tacitly challenged by a recently freed slave whose supreme martial abilities come as something of a surprise, have to fight a series of bloody battles as they make their demanding journey through the deserts and forests of China.
These battles will be a bit of a shock to anyone expecting the high-wire martial arts mayhem of classic Hong Kong cinema---in their emphasis on hard, physical fighting and relentless bloodletting they owe more to ""Gladiator"" than to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".
Nevertheless, ""Musa"" contrives  to make its conflicts as visually ravishing as possible; the glinting swords, spurting blood and severed limbs are just parts of a larger canvas in which violence is every bit as balletic as in Peckinpah's `The Wild Bunch"" and just as unavoidable as in Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai""---both of which films, with their romantic evocations of doomed fighters, come to mind when watching ""Musa"".
Despite its influences, though, the film is never derivative of earlier epics and its tale of heroism and violence is counterbalanced by its beautifully, if economically, drawn characters and its reflections on the nature of freedom, choice, and individual responsibility.
All in all, ""Musa"" is a glorious achievement that ravishes the senses and touches the heart.",1078358400,3,2373,5.082051282051282

1195210,4,B000006J4H,"Though it includes Zhang Ziyi (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" ""Rush Hour 2""), ""Musa"" (literally meaning warriors) is a Korean film about the fate of delegatation sent from Koryo, ancient kingdom of Korea, in the 14th century.  According to the material I bought at the theater here, the story is based on the historical facts about the Korean delegates sent to China.
But you don't need much knowledge about the history in the Far East to enjoy the film.  Of course, it helps, but the point is not hard to follow.  Korean delegates, sent to Chinese capitol to express the good will of the nation, were captured by the Chinese government (it was soon after Chinese managed to chase away Mongols from the mainland, who once ruled them, and Chinese were naturally very sceptical).  Now the Korean warriors who had escorted the delegate are expeled to the hot desert land.
The only hope of coming back to their land is found in an  unexpected place: Chinese Princess Pu-yong (Zhang Ziyi) crossed their path who had been kidnapped by the Mogolian troops.  If they can bring her back to China alive, Chinese government will relent and possibly allow the warriors to leave for their home.  But the formidable Mongolian warriors are chasing them, and the danger is coming closer.
The good news about ""Musa"" is its good actors, who are really ""in character.""  The young and inexperienced general Choi Jung played by Joo Jin-Mo is good, but what you notice is the complex character Yeo-sol (Jung Woo-Sung), liberated slave who uses his deadly spear gracefully.
The complicated story is saved by the fighting scenes (which are more violent than you imagine) helped by the competent editing and stunts.  But more effective is its photography, which was shot on location out in the cold seaside and the hot desert.  From the first scene (in which the warriors tread heavily under the scorching sun) you will realize that the shooting was really demaning task.
The bad news is ... not the story, but Zhang Ziyi who should look hot as the leading lady.  She is as beatiful as in ""Tiger,"" but her role is clearly a supporting one, and curiously the director does not seem interesting in expanding her character's role to give the film deeper sense of humanity.
And it is hard to say this, but the direction is slack in general.  The actions are good (almost no wire actions), as I said, but the film somehow misses opportunities to make much use of them in the context of the story.  One example; there is a scene that involves a ""Stagecoach"" situation (you know what I mean).  Directors like John Woo would never let it go without presenting some unique martial arts fighting.  In ""Musa,"" though the action itself is thrilling, it ends so soon.  What a waste.
""Musa"" is a good example of Asian film industy which is growing bigger and stronger with multi-cultural staffs -- Koreans and Chinese join force.  You will like it if you love Hong Kong action films; but I am afraid if you wish to see beautiful Zhang Ziyi, the things might look otherwise.",1076544000,7,3036,4.730550284629981
1195211,4,B000006J4H,"It's interesting to compare warriors of yesteryears with warriors of contemporary time.  Many hundred years ago, there weren't any sophisticated guidance or radar systems, ability to see in the dark, arsenals that would simply annihiliate a country from the push of a button.  Rather, it all comes down to bravery or courage, brawn, & strategies to boot.  The general outline of the story is simple enough, the Korean delegates that representated the vassal states of China were distrusted & they were sent to exile in the majestic (on the same token, vast & hostile) Gobi Desert.  It was a turbulent time where Ming Dynasty was fighting against the Mongols (for those that were well versed in Chinese history, the Mongols would eventually persevered &  formed a new Chinese Dynasty called Yuan, the time when Marco Polo visited China).  The Korean delegates were serendipitously rescued by the Mongols who would kill any Chinese or Han people in their way.  Despite being rescued, they still had to find their way out of the desert.  The original intention was to return to Korea but along the way, they came across the Chinese Princess who was kidnapped by the Mongols.  The Korean General reasoned that by saving the Princess, that would put the Korean delegates in good stead as long as the Princess was returned safely & in one piece to the Emperor of China then.  That's when the movie kicked into a higher gear.  The Princess was saved but that only entailed the Mongols to hunt them down with a vengeance.  Towns were razed & seized, & countless of innocent lives were lost as Mongols showed no mercy in getting the Princess back.  The Korean general & his followers tried to outwit the Mongols but to no avail.  Eventually, they ended up in an abandoned fortress by the sea for a final showdown.  What made this movie impressive was not only the authentic landscape of China but the fact that it depicted the diversity of China & its rightful place for being the Middle Kingdom at that time, the gradual built-up of characters from Mongols, Chinese, & Korean perspectives to the extent that we can feel for those characters, the comprehensive composition of the whole film to make it a grand epic that it rightfully deserves.  We felt for the Mongols when the Generals sat by the fire & described their plight that they were to fight a losing battle & that would bring shame to Genghis Khan's tradition & about their longing to return to the Mongolian plains if they were to survive the battle; the Koreans who were trapped in their circumstances to follow the order valiantly to return the Chinese Princess to Nangking safely despite their longing to return to Korea as soon as possible; the surviving Chinese villagers who sang their village tune to calm the nerves of women & children that were trapped in the fortress; the impossible love between the Chinese Princess & the mysterious Korean slave (obviously the hero in this movie for his pop-idol look & those heroic slow motion shots against the wind) & the infatuation of the Korean General (another pop-idol look) towards the Chinese Princess (love triangle?); the confusion & the guilt that the Princess were carrying for bringing so many people to their deaths.  In the end, the movie isn't simply about those Korean warriors but about warriors in general of them performing their duties honorably, bravely, & unconditonally.  Despite that the fighting wasn't on-par with Chinese standard & having to resort to camera tricks, it gave this movie a certain rawness.  Zhang Jiyi gave a regal performance as the Princess.  Her initial spoilt nature was eventually given way to a Princess who knew her place as a Princess & leading her people to a final confrontation with the Mongols.  The cowardly Korean interpreter reminded me so much of that coward in ""Saving Private Ryan"" & in the end, he understood the significance of dying a honorable death instead of not helping his fellow comrades.  Sargeant Jipin had a quiet demeanour & he was the pillar of strength & the voice of reasons for the Korean contingent & he led the troupe when the General seemed to have lost his way to love.  The movie ended suitably with a phrase to say that it's the journey in life that matters but not the destination itself.  Overall, a very well-done movie, akin to ""Magnificent Seven"" or the ""Seven Samurais"", ""Gladiator"" & a movie that should be seen on the big screen.  Highly recommended.",1072310400,4,4443,4.8068331143232585
1195212,2,B000006J4H,"I first watched this movie at the Asian Film Festival in SF and throughly enjoyed it. I'd give it a 4 (despite the absurd kill ratios, the inexplicable fact that the Mongols never utilize their horse archers, or the ambigious status of the princess- is she really Yuan or Chu?)
However, this DVD itself only merits 2 stars (maybe 3 if you haven't seen the original Korean version.) Why? No extras, second rate English subbing, and most irritating, they cut out about 15 minutes of the movie which developed the second characters (particularly the interactions between the priest and interpeter Park, as well as the one-eyed guy who constantly and humorously repeated that he was too ugly to get a girlfriend).
It's not a deal-killer, and I understand they did the same for other foreign releases, but the movie feels underdeveloped just the same. Why does the priest tag along? Why does Park grow a spine at the end? Do we really care that the other random guys survive until the end? You wouldn't be asking these questions if they hadn't edited those parts out of the movie.
Also, this may have been particular to my DVD, but there was an irritating glitch around 1:16:45. At this point I'm not sure whether I'll return the movie or not.",1071878400,25,1238,4.68348623853211
1195213,5,B000006J4H,"I wouldn't have known about this movie if I wasn't an Amazondotcommer.  I found it in one of those, ""if you bought this DVD, you'd want to buy this too"" follow-ups.  So I thought I'd click on it and was surprise to see that it was a South Korean movie. I have never seen a Korean movie before, so I decided to order the DVD with high expectations due to the good reviews of fellow Amazoners.  And you know what, I wasn't dissappointed at all.  This movie is terrific.  It has all the elements of an ""edge-of-your-seat"" adventure: love, honour, bravery, conflict, vast sceneries and loads and loads of testestorone driven battle scenes.  What's not to like about this movie.  Compare it all you want to other similiar Hollywood movies until the sun goes down, at the end, it is movie in itself.  No trace of Hollywood here. It has a subtlety that is unique. This is evident in the numerous sub-plots.  The kidnapped Ming princess is obviously  smittened by the spear wielding, ex slave, Yeosol and he in return is equally enamoured, but these asumptions are only culled from certain gestures, a word spoken here and there and yet their love for each other is so palpable. And how about the young general, Choi.  His reason for saving the princess as he tells it to his men, is a ticket out of China.  Yeah, right.  The second that a breeze lifts the Princess's veil and he was able to see her stuning porcelain face, is the moment he decided to save her.  Imagine these two good looking, verile men fighting to the death just for her.  Just enough to make a girl swone. This movie is full of little gems like this.
The movie is also full of interesting characters like the Yuan General(Yu Ruan Goung from ""Iron Monkey""), the archery expert, Sergeant Jinlip, the cowardly novice, Douchong and they even managed to throw in a pregnant peasant.
The movie moves swiftly with no slow parts, and though it is very gory, (everything gets lopped-off including the horses, guess they don't have PETA over there in Korea) I think the bloody scenes are not  gratitious and thye are  well justified.
My favorite thing about this movie is how the three characters relate to each other and how in very little words and gestures, are able to convey the essence of who they are.  And as the events unfold to its tragic end, you can see that each have resolve their own fears even if it means their demise.
The 130 minutes didn't feel long and if anything, I hated for this movie to end. I thoroughly enjoyed it. My only complain is that this DVD has NO EXTRAS at all. It is handsomely packaged but NO EXTRAS.  would have been nice. But thank god, it's not dubbed.",1071360000,124,2646,4.497907949790795

No Hollywood movie can compare to this spectacular film of amazing proportion!!

The actors are top of the line as well as the camera men. This movie tops ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator"" for the shear realism and to me the reason it is 2 years late reaching America is that Hollywood didn't want to be put to shame. Once viewed this movie will stick in your mind. I watched the Chinese version and was blown away. The realism is so good that Koreans speak Korean and the chinese speak Chinese. While it has a no rating do be warned that the violence is graphic. And for less then 20 bucks such movie making is a steal.",1063929600,17,661,4.131782945736434

Second, the action scenes gave me a literal headache, trying to make out what the heck was going on! I couldn't figure who was fighting/dying, it was horrible in some scenes...all the blurred angles and what not.
The story line was so so and I also felt that Ziyi Zhang's character (princess) was over done. She was way too spoiled and never really redeemed herself even after all that she had been through. It's just an ok movie, maybe worth watching as long as it's free or cheap!",1416787200,,669,4.317460317460317
