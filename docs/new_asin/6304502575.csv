7873172,5,6304502575,"Own a VCR? Total art nerd? Feel undereducated in American art history? Get it. Hughes' critiques are insightful (and sometimes incisive), the body of work is broad but not overwhelming, and each tape is roughly 45-50 minutes long--an appreciably bite-sized chunk of time for someone who doesn't want to lose whole evenings to this intriguing series.",1427241600,,349,5.25
7873173,5,6304502575,"It's too bad this series isn't on pristine DVD. The VHS versions are a bit blurry and the sound is not so great but even so, it is a treasure and wonderful to watch over and over again. Robert Hughes was an incredibly eloquent writer and art critic.",1420070400,,249,4.208333333333333
7873174,5,6304502575,"Marvelous for the humanities, art, or art history major/geek/buff! Just wish it would come out on DVD. Highly recommend this series along with Hughes' book.",1336694400,,156,5.28
7873175,5,6304502575,"Robert Hughes gives another tour de force tour of art history, this time the American scene from its roots in Thomas Jefferson's classical city plans to the outrageous hype of the recent past. Sometimes, the most accurate assessments of a country are offered by a brilliant mind from another land. I just wish someone would re-issue this series on Blu-Ray or DVD. The VHS format is outdated and doesn't do the subject the justice it deserves.",1269993600,,442,4.828947368421052
7873176,5,6304502575,"...that I saw in the portuguese public tv in the late 90's, and, surprisingly I found that there's no DVD edition...
I think, till further notice that this is the best documentary about the american art.",1236211200,,203,4.666666666666667
7873177,5,6304502575,I have seen the entire series of AMERICAN VISIONS and consider it to be one of the best art commentaries ever. I have HUNTED for the DVD version of the series for years and think that it is VERY REMISS of PBS for not releasing  AMERICAN VISIONS on DVD. This is an excellent resource for students of art and history - it provides an insight into when specific art styles developed and describing the context in which they thrived. Robert Hughes is a knowledgeable and riveting presenter.,1208995200,,486,4.586206896551724
7873178,4,6304502575,"I was first exposed to Robert Hughes's unique and valuable insights into the world of art & art criticism with his groundbreaking SHOCK OF THE NEW (BBC documentary--which I would LOVE to see re-released on DVD!! Hint! hint!) on the history of Modern Art....there are some points of intersection, obviously, between AMERICAN VISIONS and SHOCK OF THE NEW.  But AMERICAN VISIONS encompasses the entire sweep of American art from Colonial and Revolutionary America down to the 1990s, and Hughes does a very good job...perhaps only as outsider (Hughes is a native Australian) can...of demostrating what is uniquely American about the Art found in AMERICAN VISIONS.  I refrain from giving Hughes 5 stars because he has grown more curmudgeonly with age, and I find I am turned off by his unsympathetic dismissal of 1990s ""multi-culti"" (his words) trends in arts & culture.  While I'll offer no blanket endorsement of Postmodernism either, I won't, like Hughes, throw the baby out with the bathwater.  Whereas Hughes sneers with contempt at contemporary Taos, NM, for example--I find the New Mexico art & cultural scene much more sympathetic, almost an after-echo of the 1960s.  Still, one has to admire Hughes's forthright opinions.  He didn't get to be the renowned art critic of TIME magazine by being unfailingly nice to everyone either.

  Check your local library's video holdings; If they don't have a copy of AMERICAN VISIONS (the complete set), urge them to get it today!  If they say their budget won't allow it, donate it to them! (significant library donations are tax-deductible, fyi!!).  I would also check with PBS to see if they plan on coming out with this series on DVD.  It's a bit steep to buy a personal copy of the whole series, but it'd make a great gift to a starving art student or working artist or art teacher who could not otherwise afford it.",1109030400,,1863,4.916932907348243
7873179,5,6304502575,I found this series to be in a word fascinating.  Robert Hughes manages to view the art of America through a historical and cultural perspective - particularly for the international viewer.  It explores the cultural and  social forces which influenced the artists and I must say that I throughly  enjoyed the series.  For a non-American I found it an excellent study into  the wealth of American Art - which is not especially that well-known  outside American itself.  Highly recommended!,960768000,,488,5.0886075949367084
