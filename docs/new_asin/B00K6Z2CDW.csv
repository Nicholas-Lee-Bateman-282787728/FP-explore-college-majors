It shouldn't strike anyone as ""portraying Japan as a victim and not an aggressor"" at all. It definitely does portray that all human beings caught up in a vicious war of any kind are all victims, regardless of nationality. And it definitely depicts the total insanity of the kamikaze strategy as sheer madness, futility and murder, as voiced by several of the characters in the movie.

Because the Allies (the good guys) fought the Japanese (the bad guys), reviewers like those mentioned above that have been brought up on John Wayne type Hollywood brainwashing have to instantly see any Japanese attempt to portray their own human feelings and sufferings as not worthy and something to be dismissed merely as Jap propaganda. They are the Japs, the bad guys, after all, so there's no need to say any more about them, is there?

The title Eternal Zero is not just referring to the name of the Zero fighter, but rather immediately tells us that the eternal 'O' powerfully symbolises the continuity of all life  an 'O', without beginning or end  another subtle and profound recurring theme which is prominent throughout the film. From this perspective, the final scene that bothers above lone-star and Variety so much really does give you something to ponder. All said, 'Zero' should be seen as a profound Japanese anti-war film.

This is a moving, well-told story with interesting plot surprises, beautifully-filmed with masterful CGI that is actually a pleasure to watch, and is above all, a very humane movie.
Beautiful, moving and poignant...this film deserves to be seen.",1470355200,,1887,4.977777777777778
8656451,5,B00K6Z2CDW,"Seen this from another import. Typically NOT a fan of JP movies because of how the way they act. What can i say i like non asian movies cause they speak more realistically. The story itself was good. I like watching alot of the WWII documentaries and i think this portrayed well what the normal people went through. Despite the governments being the ones making the decisions, its always the civilians that have to do the job and suffer for it. Though its a bit saddening to see hate trolls post reviews on a movie that was meant to portray the hardships of the people.",1470096000,,569,4.428571428571429
8656452,3,B00K6Z2CDW,"Buyer beware. This Blu Ray DVD has NO english subtitles, despite the description indicating this. It is a 100% Japanese DVD, with Kanji menus. If you do not speak or read Japanese, you are out of luck.",1463443200,,201,4.45945945945946

8656454,5,B00K6Z2CDW,"I just saw this movie on airline entertainment, NOT on a flight to/from Japan incidentally. I also do know a lot of WWII history of the Pacific War.  But the twists and turns in this movie are as numerous as those typified by the Zero fighter itself, and in the end is a tear-jerker of a beautiful love story. I want to buy this to keep in my personal film library, so I might turn to it again and again to appreciate is subtlety..  Like Clint Eastwood's film to humanize the Japanese defenders of Iwo Jima, these fictional portrayals do lend some credibility to an alternative view of history, from a defeated enemy's perspective.
  We should be able to appreciate the movie from an artistic standard, while putting it in the proper perspective of the irrefutable fanaticism of the Japanese military elite. Obviously, some kamikazis were willing and eager volunteers, while others were no doubt coerced or shamed into their suicide missions.
  I am not sure why the juxtaposition of the documented Rape of Nanking and this movie has occurred, because I do not believe they are historically connected in any way, other than they may be considered manifestations of the Bushido warrior's code extant in Japanese society at that time in their history.",1408924800,12,1249,4.813084112149533
8656455,3,B00K6Z2CDW,"This movie about kamikaze pilots with an unfortunate name in English made Morinaga heiress Akie Abe cry.  You fund her every time you buy Morinaga tofu, candy, etc. from a Chinese supermarket.  Do her tears disguise true colors come a knocking once again on the world's door.  Are you sure you are letting the right one in when you hear entreaties and see tears?  They're good now.  Superior to everyone in fact.

They're sly enough to claim that they are anti whitewashing and are antikamikaze and pro-peace but in a plane that is not remote controlled, they CHOOSE to take others with them into death.  And time and time again, we are shown examples that teach us that we can't be selfish and save our own families at the expense of someone else's because that is elitist thinking e.g. the guy who aids and abetts Khan in the latest Star Trek movie because Khan saves his daughter's life.

Why didn't they dive bomb their bosses HQ- that might have ended the kamikaze program, ne?

They really can't claim that they are not choosing sides - which is reminiscent of what Edward Snowden has been saying all along about the people knowingly wrongfully invading privacy in the name of security continuously even after knowing that the privacy they invade has nothing to do with security.

This movie gets released in Taiwan next week as if the Taiwanese are not faking pro-Japaneseness.

Eternal Zero vs Drift Compatible - Sophie's Choice which one invites amusement and disdain simultaneously.

And if you do see this movie, Google Indian POW RABAUL and women RABAUL so you get a more balanced view of how TRAUMATIZED these turkeys were re the Bombing of Rabaul.

Do you Morinaga?  I don't.

KYUSHU UNIVERSITY ATROCITY

After a bombing mission over southern Japan on May 5, 1945, the crew of a B-29 bomber had to bale out after being rammed by a Japanese suicide plane. The B-29 crashed near the town of Takete. After landing, the crew were taken into custody and transported to Kyushu University in Fukuoka about one hundred miles north of Nagasaki. In the university's anatomy department they were subjected to the most horrible medical experiments imaginable. One prisoner was shot in the stomach so that Japanese surgeons could get practice at removing bullets. Amputations on legs and arms were practiced while the victims were still alive. One was injected with sea water in an experiment to find out if sea water could be substituted for saline solution. One badly wounded American, thinking he was going to be treated for his wound, was anaesthetized and woke up to find that one of his lungs had been removed. He died shortly after. Others had part of the liver removed to see if they could still live. Only one airman, the pilot of the B-29, Captain Marvin Watkins, was taken to Tokyo for interrogation but survived the war. The other eight all died at Fukuoka. After the war, twenty three doctors and hospital staff were arrested, tried and found guilty on various charges by the Allied War Crimes Trials held at Yokohama. Five were sentenced to death, the others to terms of imprisonment. When the Korean war started in June, 1950, General Douglas MacArthur reduced most of the sentences. The death sentences were never carried out. All were released by 1958",1408320000,3,3281,4.809608540925267
