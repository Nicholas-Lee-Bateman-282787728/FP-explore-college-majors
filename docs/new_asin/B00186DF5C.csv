3411759,3,B00186DF5C,"These NFL FIlms release are getting SOOO Confusing.
If this set has the 1999 Super Bowl, why not make it a ""ROAD TO THE 1999 Super Bowl"" releases and have the playoffs of 1999 and then the superbowl.

There are all these different sets, with a few game here and a few game there.  NFL films is doing a terrible job of releasing games.
I am a music and Movie collector, and I think I know how many collectors think.
We want ENTIRE seasons, not 3 games from 3 different years just because they were good games.  I would watch the boring games where my team loses too, because I like to watch the progression of my favorite teams throughout the year.
NFL films should concentrate on releasing each superbowl, packaged with all the pay off games first. THen look at releasing the entire seasons of the superbowl winner.

ps. and start releasing on blu-ray !!!",1214438400,4,855,4.461538461538462

3411773,4,B00186DF5C,"One of the criticisms I had for the ""History of the Denver Broncos"" DVD is that it was missing some key games in the extras section that would have been much more appropriate to include than ""The Drive,"" as historically significant as it was--namely, the 1977 AFC Championship and the first Super Bowl victory.  That is rectified with this DVD release, as well as the second Super Bowl victory over the Falcons.  As others have noted, no frills on this set--just the games, although the player introductions for the Super Bowl are included.

There are legitimate gripes to be made regarding the video quality of the AFC Championship--the first quarter and a half or so is washed out, and then suddenly becomes much clearer for the rest of the game.  If you didn't get a chance to watch the original Orange Crush in the 1970s, seeing guys like Randy Gradishar, the vastly underrated Bob Swenson, Lyle Alzado, Rubin Carter, and Tom Jackson do their thing will make you realize just how good that defense really was.  The Super Bowls are fantastic and it's still thrilling to watch Steve Atwater slam into Brett Favre, John Elway do the helicopter, and Rod Smith do the long catch-and-run against an overmatched Eugene Robinson.

Another game or two would have improved this collection.  Others have noted the 1984 Snow Bowl and the 1991 playoff comeback against Houston, among others.  I'd also nominate the 1984 OT victory against the Raiders in Los Angeles, which was a great back-and-forth contest, and the 1973 Monday Night Game against Oakland that ended in a tie.",1337817600,,1567,4.842696629213483
3411774,4,B00186DF5C,"I'm not going to rehash what others have already said -  You know what games are available, who the players are, etc.  I bought this for my father who's been a Broncos fan since the early 70's.  He honestly couldn't recall if he'd seen the '77 game, so it was like watching a new game...  But the quality was terrible!  If the NFL worked on restoring the films of these older games, I'd gladly pay more money.  As a 20-something who can't remember football before the 90's, the game was unwatchably fuzzy for me.  It looks terrible on an HDTV, and even the audio is compromised.  You might as well put the first disc in the garbage.

However, I bought these discs for the Superbowl games, and they're clear and viewable.  Not a lot of extra junk, no frills, and you're not overpaying.  Until they restore the old film, they might as well just package the 97/98 Superbowls.  If it had just been those two, I'd give the product five stars.",1328659200,,937,4.415204678362573
3411775,3,B00186DF5C,"I bought this for the two Superbowl victories and it does have these games however, it does not have any of the post game celebration and is missing a lot of the between play action.  It states at the beginning of each DVD that some of the games or plays may be missing due to the age of the footage and they are not kidding.  The quality definitely reflects the time it was originally filmed but since this is the only way to get these games I didn't have a choice.  Overall I am happy with it, but I wish they would have put more effort into cleaning it up and including more footage.",1325030400,,586,4.12280701754386

3411777,3,B00186DF5C,"The two Superbowl wins and the '77 AFC title game certainly are the three biggest wins...and admittedly, they belong on a ""Greatest Games"" collection.  But too many legendary games are missing to call this pitiful offering a ""Greatest Games.""  My personal list would include:

14.  1999 Playoffs - Denver 38, Miami 3.  Terrell Davis, coming off his 2000 yard season, shreds the Miami defense for 199 yards on only 21 carries--and sits out the entire 4th quarter. The Fins, one of only 2 teams to have beaten Denver during the regular season, are just a bump in the road as the Broncos motor towards their second consecutive Super Bowl win.

13.  1999 - Superbowl XXXIII - Denver 37, Atlanta 19.  John Elway's final game, also memorable for Elway's 80-yard bomb to Rod Smith and because the Broncos finally kick the living cr*p out of an opponent during a Super Bowl.  The 1999 Broncos were clearly the best Broncos team ever.

12.  1977 Regular Season - Denver 30, Raiders 7.  Denver carries a 4-0 record into Oakland to face their arch-nemesis, the Oakand Raiders, also 4-0. Denver had never even fielded a playoff team before; Oakland was the defending Super Bowl champ.  Oakland scores on its first possession, Ken Stabler to Dave Casper, and Denver fans wonder, Are these Broncos for real?  Denver answers in emphatic fashion.  After that first Oakland possession, the legendary Denver Orange Crush defense absolutely destroys the vaunted Oakland line, stuffing the Raiders on the ground and harrying Stabler into making 7(!) interceptions.  Denver pummels its way to a 14-7 lead, and late in the half, appears ready to tack on another 3 points with a field goal attempt.  Surprise!  Holder Norris Weese pulls the ball up, and 60-year old kicker Jim Turner (of '69 Jets fame--ok, he wasn't 60 but he was at least 40 and fat and slow) ambles his way unnoticed to the back of the end-zone, where he pulls in the pass from Weese to put the Broncos up 21-7 at the half.  Stunned, the Raiders never recover their famous pride and poise, and Denver wins going away.  The Denver Broncos, finally, for the first time EVER, are for real.

11.  1983 Regular Season - Denver 21, Baltimore Colts 19.  OK, I got the blowouts out of the way, now for the close ones.  This was the first of Elway's legendary comebacks.  It's Elway's rookie season and he's playing only because Steve DeBerg is hurt; he throws 5 interceptions and Denver trails the Colts 19-0 heading into the 4th quarter.  Suddenly Elway turns into Superman, throwing 3 TDs, the final one on 4th down, and the Broncs win. It was a taste of the Hall of Fame career to come.

10.  1992 Playoffs - Denver 26, Houston 24.  Everybody remembers The Drive from the '88 AFC Championship Game.  But this game featured, uh, The Other Drive.  With 2:07 left and no time outs remaining, Denver is on its own 2 yard line trailing 24-23.  Using his own legs, Elway converts a 4th and 6 to keep the drive alive, then faces a 4th and 10 on his own 35.  Of course he converts the first down, hitting Vance Johnson for 44 yards and setting up the winning field goal by David Treadwell as time expires.

9.  1985 regular season - Denver 30, San Diego 24 (OT).  This game features an aging Dan Fouts vs. a young Elway, a 98-yard kickoff return by Mike Anderson, and two 4th quarter lead changes before Denver ties the game with a field goal as time expires.  But the reason this game is one of The Broncos' Greatest is the two blocked field goal attempts by Denver safety Dennis Smith--on consecutive plays no less (replayed because Denver mistakenly called time out before the first snap)--and Louis Wright's electrifying game-winning 60-yard touchdown return after the second blocked kick.

8.  1994 regular season - KC 34, Denver 28.  Classic Monday night matchup: Joe Montana vs. John Elway.  The game is tied at 21 going into the 4th quarter.  KC goes ahead with a field goal and is poised to run out the clock when Ted Washington causes Marcus Allen to fumble, and Karl Mecklenburg recovers for Denver with 2:25 left.  Elway promptly leads the Broncos on a scoring drive, taking it in himself on a rollout from the 6.  Montana gets the ball back with only 1:29 left...and proceeds to pick apart the Denver secondary, hitting 7 of 8 passes, capped by the winning TD throw to Willie Davis with 8 seconds left.  The only Denver loss on this list, but a game I'll never forget.

7.  1988 AFC Title Game - Denver 38, Cleveland 33.  Denver bolts to a 21-3 lead, then Cleveland comes back to tie it at 31 before Elway hits Sammy Winder for the winning 23-yard TD.  Cleveland's last-ditch drive ends with Ernest Byner's Fumble at the Broncos 2 with 1:12 left, part of NFL lore.

4 (Tie).  The Revenge Tour:  The 1998 Playoffs

Denver 42, Jacksonville 17.  After the previous season's monumental 30-27 playoff upset loss at the hands of the Jags, Denver redeems itself.  Denver again jumps out to an early lead but this time they keep the pedal to the metal.  Both Davis AND backup Derek Loville post 100 yard rushing games against the Jags, as the Broncos score early and often.  This has to be the most satisfying **s-whipping ever delivered by a Broncos team.

Denver 14, KC 10.  A real nailbiter in KC against the hated Chiefs, who had beaten Denver just a few weeks previously to claim the division title.  The Denver D make Davis' 1-yard TD plunge in the 4th quarter stand up, and the Broncos advance to the AFC title game against another old nemesis, the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Denver 24, Pittsburgh 21.  In Pittsburgh.  Denver intercepts Cordell Stewart 3 times and forces a fumble, and Davis and the O-line run the ball right down the Steelers' throats.  Denver is up 10 in the 4th quarter when Pittsburgh finally gets untracked and pulls within three.  Denver runs it right up the gut for a first down, and needs one more first down to run out the clock.  Elway tells Shannon Sharpe ""Just get open,"" and Sharpe does.  Elway's 5-yard pass converts the first down and all those ""Terrible Towels"" suddenly stop waving.  Beautiful.

3.  1977 AFC Title Game - Denver 20, Oakland 17.  Mile High Stadium.  Defending Super Bowl Champ Oakland had split the season series with Denver (see game no. 12) to set up the ultimate rubber match.  The Raiders score first, but the Broncos respond with a Craig Morton-to-Haven Moses 74 yard TD strike.  Game on.  In Oakland they still blame the loss on the early whistle on Rob Lytle's fumble, and Oakland coach John Madden still swears Jon Keyworth fumbled the ball before he broke the plane of the goal line on Denver's second touchdown.  Get over it, Raiderettes.  The real reason Denver wins is because when the game is on the line, the vaunted Raiders' defense can't stop the run.  After Ken Stabler's TD to Dave Casper pulls the Raiders within 3 late in the 4th quarter, Denver runs over Oakland guard John Matuszak in much the same way that a city bus runs over a squirrel, except unlike a squirrel, the 'Tooz had to keep getting up, only to be run over again.

2.  1987 AFC Title Game - Denver 23, Cleveland 20.  AFC Title Game, in Cleveland.  The Drive.  With Denver trailing 20-13 with 3 minutes left, Elway takes Denver 98 yards in 15 plays, into the teeth of the infamous Dog Pound.  His 5 yard bullet to Mark Jackson ties the game with 39 seconds left.  Rich Karlis wins it for Denver with a field goal in OT.

1.  1998 - Super Bowl XXXII - Denver 31, Green Bay 24.  This game has been done to death, so I'll mention a play that usually gets overlooked in the game summaries:  ""The Block.""  In the first half, skinny Denver wide receiver Eddie McCaffery absolutely destroys a hapless Packers linebacker on a Davis running play, sending the Packers a message they couldn't miss:  this time, with this team, it's gonna be different.  After 38 years of futility and 4 previous Super Bowl fiascos, the Broncos--yes, the Broncos!--are going to win a Super Bowl.",1290124800,4,7941,4.611150822015725

3411779,3,B00186DF5C,"After the great job that Warner Bros has done of releasing sets for other NFL teams and their NHL 10 greatest games sets, i was expecting more from this.  Don't get me wrong, it's great to finally be able to throw out my old recorded VHS tapes of Super Bowls 32 & 33, but 3 games is all we get for the Broncos?  Something is wrong here.

They should have done what they did with the NHL sets and done the Denver Broncos 10 greatest games.  Imagine how much better this would have been if we would have gotten a full collection instead.  I would have included the following games...

10.  1997 Divisional Playoff vs. Kansas City Chiefs
9.  2005 Divisional Playoff vs. New England Patriots
8.  1989 AFC Championship Game vs. Cleveland Browns
7.  1998 AFC Championship Game vs. New York Jets

3411780,4,B00186DF5C,"This set is really just a little taste of some of the greatest moments for fans of the Denver Broncos.  It is very good as far as it goes, but there should be a lot more included in a set entitled, 'Denver Broncos Greatest Games'.

Even though it is much less than it could and should be, this is a fun set.  It contains the 1977 AFC Championship game against the Oakland Raiders that sent the Broncos to their first ever Super Bowl.  This disk relives that great game with some of the all time greats for both teams including Randy Gradishar, Tom Jackson, Craig Morton, and Haven Moses for the Broncos.  Some of the Raiders' greats (it hurts a Broncos fan to even use those two words together) included are Kenny Stabler, Dave Casper, Lester Hayes, and John Matuszak, along with a much younger coach John Madden.

Disk Two contains Super Bowl XXXII, the Broncos first win in the big game against the Green Bay Packers.  There are some very memorable moments, particularly with John Elway and Terrell Davis.  Brett Favre had some great moments in a losing effort.

The final game included in this series is Super Bowl XXXIII, which saw the Broncos defeat the Atlanta Falcons for their second consecutive championship.

This is a lot of fun.  I would certainly encourage NFL Films to compile a much better collection.  There are many outstanding moments in Denver Broncos history that should be highlighted.",1253059200,,1406,4.6938775510204085

I have to say that it did come when I expected it whichis nice and after much time searching for the 77/78 playoff game from sites like the actual Broncos website to NFL.com to any search engine possible and even youtube I was so very happy to find this DVD.

This is the only full game dvd set there is that shows the entirety of the game not just highlights just as though you borrowed a trusted beta and vhs from a trusted friend. They did a great job editing the footage and by editing I mean the tracking is great and the picture was better than expected from a tape from 1977.

If you are looking for a great DVD and gift this would be it. My husband loves the fact that it is not just footage and highlights and all the other nitty gritty but the real game with real calls save the commercials all in real time!

3411788,4,B00186DF5C,"This DVD set contains the 1977 AFC title game, Super Bowl 32 ,and Super Bowl 33.

The two Super Bowl wins have already been replayed a few times on the NFL Network.  But not the 1977 classic.  So, like many Broncos fans, I bought the set primarily to relive the 1/1/1978 AFC Championship against Denver's biggest rival, the Oakland Raiders.

At first, I was disappointed in the quality of the Raiders game.  The entire 1st quarter looks like somebody's old VHS video tape that has been watched one too many times.  It is OK, but the colors are a bit washed out, and there is a definite lack of sharpness.  There are a few VHS-type flickers on the screen, etc.  But then early in the 2nd quarter - right before a Raiders field goal clangs off the right goalpost - there is suddenly a seamless ""merge"" to a much, much better footage.  After this switch, the footage is better and sharper, with vibrant colors and no defects.  The game looked fantastic from this point onwards, and I definitely felt like I had been taken back to Mile High Stadium on that bitter cold New Year's Day in 1978.  It was great to visit ""Broncomania"" in its early days - this was the Broncos' first winning season, their first visit to the NFL Playoffs, and (of course) their first AFC title.

Little did Broncos fans know that after the 1977 breakout year, they would wait 20 more seasons to finally get a Super Bowl victory.  The set contains both Super Bowls at the end of the Elway era - the memorable January 1998 win against the Packers (in which the Broncos were huge underdogs), and the blowout win against the Falcons in January 1999 to give Denver ""back-to-back"" supremacy.

Pros of this DVD set:  Great quality video (for the most part). 2 of the 3 games are nailbiters filled with tension - NFL/Broncos playoff football at its best.  Great to see the original TV broadcasts available for purchase - in their entirety - instead of boring and recycled NFL Films footage.

Cons of this DVD set:  No pre-game for any of these games - they simply start right before the opening kickoff.  The entire 1st quarter of the Raiders game just looks like OK VHS video.  The games are slightly edited - some huddles and dead action are removed.  The edits are done in a way that you might not notice the cuts if you weren`t watching carefully, but they are there and there are a lot of them.  Finally, this set doesn't include the ""Drive,"" the ""Fumble,"" or other classic Broncos playoff and regular season games.  Maybe those and other Broncos classics will be the subject of a future release?

Despite these issues, if you are a die-hard Broncos fans, this set is a ""no-brainer"" - you will not be disappointed.",1219881600,15,2684,4.532224532224532
3411789,2,B00186DF5C,"Here's what Warner Home Video says...
For the first time, the original network broadcast of three classic Denver Broncos games are available to own in this thrilling three-DVD set. Relive the excitement of these unforgettable moments in Broncos history: 1977 AFC Championship Game - After years of waiting, the Broncos defeated the archrival Oakland Raiders 20-17 to clinch their first trip to the Super Bowl. Haven Moses caught 5 passes for 168 yards and his two touchdown receptions from Craig Morton proved to be the difference in the game. Super Bowl XXXII - John Elway and Terrell Davis sparked the team's first world championship as Denver topped Green Bay 31-24. Davis was named the game's most valuable player, rushing for 157 yards on 30 carries and a Super Bowl record 3 touchdowns. Super Bowl XXXIII - John Elway retired on a winning note as the Broncos topped Atlanta in Super Bowl XXXIII. Elway, in his final performance, completed 18 of 29 passes for 336 yards and a touchdown. He was named the game's most valuable player. These broadcasts are an essential piece of Broncos history now available.

I couldn't agree more that this set will be missing countless big games in Broncos history. How about The Drive? How about The Fumble? Or Elway's most amazing comeback, the one against Houston in the playoffs? How about his comeback against the Raiders from a 17 point deficit? The 2 TD passes to Vance Johnson late against the Chiefs? Although I've already pre-ordered this set, I am already disappointed that it is clearly missing most of the best games I've seen the Broncos play over the last 20+ years. What a shame.",1215993600,25,1634,4.85663082437276

You get the point.  NFL Films has done a fairly good job (non-widescreen or Blu-Ray notwithstanding) of releasing full games for Super Bowl winners, much to the fans' excitement.

So what in the world happened here?  The material to work with is pretty good -- back-to-back champions to send out a legendary quarterback on top.  Look at the Packers' Greatest Games set -- it contains 10 games, 9 that had Brett Favre as QB.  Look at the Bears' Greatest Games set -- it contains 12 games from one season.  Few would argue that the late-90s Broncos are as legendary as those Bears, but 2 games from those seasons?  Come on!

How much better would this set sell if it went something like this:
1996 AFC Divisonal -- Jaguars 30, Broncos 27
1997 Week 12 -- Chiefs 24, Broncos 22
1997 Week 15 -- Steelers 35, Broncos 24
(These three losses set up the ""revenge tour"" quite nicely)
1997 AFC Wild Card -- Broncos 42, Jaguars 17
1997 AFC Divisional -- Broncos 14, Chiefs 10
1997 AFC Championship -- Broncos 24, Steelers 21
1997 Super Bowl -- Broncos 31, Packers 24
1998 Week 1 -- Broncos 27, Patriots 21 (celebration of previous title)
1998 Week 14 -- Broncos 35, Chiefs 31 (streak extended ... at least for another week)
1998 Week 15 -- Giants 20, Broncos 16 (paradise lost)
1998 Week 17 -- Broncos 28, Seahawks 21 (TD 2000 yards)
1998 AFC Divisional -- Broncos 38, Dolphins 3
1998 AFC Championship -- Broncos 23, Jets 10
1998 Super Bowl -- Broncos 34, Falcons 19

This is a set that would make Broncos fans finally put away their old VHS cassettes.  14 games, containing all of the best moments -- and low points that set them up -- that would completely sum up that era of football for Broncos fans.

If that's too much, then at least cut it in half to 7 games and include all 7 playoff victories in those two seasons.

NFL Films -- the money is out there for the taking.  The products are simple.  You've offered superior sets to every single Super Bowl winner dating back to the 1995 Cowboys.  Get it together for the Broncos!",1215216000,25,2540,4.381663113006397

8268429,4,B00186DF5C,"The Broncs' first two SB victories and first AFC championship. The first quarter of the 1978 game is poor quality, but improves to what one would expect from that vintage. The 1988 and '89 Bowls are just fine. The No Fun League needs to release more older games, at least from the 1970's, from the original broadcasts. They have put some games on Youtube, but mostly from the 2000's.",1495756800,,383,4.565217391304348
