6105826,5,B00GS1JRPY,"The most entertaining mystery animes you'll ever see, wrapped up in a mecha and you'd have never seen it coming...Du Hu Hu

Really that is probably the best way to put it. Robotics Notes sets you up with a plot which could only go Gundam, then you find yourself in a web of conspiracies. Who is the bad guy? Who is the good guy? The story plays out leaving you hanging at times and you will want to keep going.

When you watch it, don't keep a preconception that you know the world or how the story will play out in the end. Because you won't. Robotics Notes will take your preconceptions and rip them a new one.

Characters, are a little better than standard anime tropes. There are some common factors but they come off fresh part due to the plot.

The only major fault would come later as the truth starts to come forth. It may kinda leave you a little confused for a moment till you take everything in. So consider this a heads up. Pay attention to everything. It is all important. Some moments will really shock the heck out of you. Especially because you either won't see it coming or the series just suddenly gets very in your face real.

This is not a rent series, this is a buy series. If you are curious and on the fence, check out an episode or two online. At this writing, Funimation's intro price is very steep for a 12 episode part. Its a great series but $60 is high. Recommend waiting or shopping around. Till then...Du Hu Hu!!",1389571200,45,1443,4.290441176470588
6105839,5,B00GS1JRPY,Great! i personally love this series!,1417910400,,37,5.333333333333333
6105840,5,B00GS1JRPY,I like this anime. I enjoy the story and the artwork is good. It not like IS anime or Line barrel of iron anime but it is good. I can not wait to see the 2nd season. I like to know what happen!,1415491200,,193,3.511627906976744
6105841,4,B00GS1JRPY,liked it,1412553600,,8,3.5
6105842,4,B00GS1JRPY,"Ok to begin with, I love anime and this is the first time I've ever reviewed lower than a 5 and it hurts me to say but this anime isn't perfect. Don't get me wrong, it's good and the art and characters are amazing.  You will laugh and love most of it. HOWEVER, the story is everywhere!!!! It never really finishes any plot or the many many subplots that it starts. So if u watch it and wonder about something intriguing that they bring up... Most likely you won't get an answer.  The ending was the biggest disappointment.  There are a billion questions and plots and random themes. Worst of all I felt that the protagonist was shifted to 2nd lead character!
Nonetheless I would recommend because it's beautiful and cute, just be aware of upcoming flaws.",1411084800,,754,4.489051094890511

6105844,5,B00GS1JRPY,Thank you. Also let me be utilized.,1406419200,,35,4.142857142857143
6105845,5,B00GS1JRPY,really good case. show isn't half bad either :D,1406160000,,47,4.333333333333333
6105846,5,B00GS1JRPY,I didn't ever seen this show before I bought it... but the reviews and synpso piqued my curious. So I bought it and end up love this show. Great and added up to my collection. Artbox and other stuff are awesome!,1404864000,,211,4.170731707317073
6105847,5,B00GS1JRPY,really good show i highly recommend it and it connects with steins gate and chaos head,1404086400,,86,4.4375
6105848,5,B00GS1JRPY,"Pretty much met my standards, and that's saying something since I'm not typically one for ""mecha"" shows. Another good show from the people who brought you Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate",1404086400,,181,5.275862068965517
6105849,5,B00GS1JRPY,This is awesome series kinda unique in its own way it starts of slow but picks up around the final 9 episodes,1402012800,,109,4.0
6105850,3,B00GS1JRPY,"This isn't a great show, but it's still well done, the animation is nice, and it takes its topic of robotics seriously. My young daughters, who speak Japanese, are enjoying the show so that's a plus for them. While I haven't seen all the episodes, the show appears to be fine for younger kids as well as the target audience of teens. I do have a gripe with Funimation, though, which produced the Blu-Ray set. Every time I pop in the first disc it automatically shows a very graphic trailer for the feature anime Akira that cannot be skipped, and which shocked my daughters. I like that movie, but for Funimation to have strung together some of the most disgusting scenes (such as the disembowlment dream sequence) from that movie is irresponsible considering who the target audience of Robotics: Notes likely is. The show is recommended, but beware of the Akira trailer at the beginning.",1401321600,16,887,4.7290322580645165
6105851,5,B00GS1JRPY,"I recommend this show, it is interesting, not action-packed but definitely not boring. Need to watch both season to get the whole deeper plot, lots more going on than first few episodes suggest. Likeable characters with individual personalities. Very cute girls but no fan-service, so if that's what you want, get High School DxD (Great show also, but totally different) Oh, and this has GIANT ROBOTS!!",1398470400,2,402,5.106060606060606
6105852,3,B00GS1JRPY,"This anime almost does little to set itself apart from the very crowded anime library. It doesn't help that it's former brethren was Steins; Gate which one it's own was one of most interesting, entertaining, and smartly written series with lovable characters. This series is not Steins;Gate however it is very competent and enjoyable. The characters are very likable and I did not mind it's slow pace, I thought it worked for this series.
My favorite elements were, like Steins;Gate, the idea of a conspiracy or a sense of impending doom approaching, the slow pace gives this doom a more alarm, I am not sure if this pace pays off in the later half of the series since the cliffhanger left little to write home about.
If you're looking for a new anime with some entertaining story-lines I would grab this at a cheap price, i got it when it was 20 dollars here on Amazon but since then I noticed the price has gone way up. I'm not sure if it's worth it at 50 dollars.
Robotics; Notes isn't bad at all but it's not a breath-taker either.",1397520000,4,1035,4.481481481481482
6105853,5,B00GS1JRPY,Just got to say this show is just awesome. The back of the box pretty much tells you all you need to know.,1396483200,,106,3.652173913043478
6105854,5,B00GS1JRPY,"This series is off to a good start and I look forward to where it is going next.  There are definite ""call backs"" to remind you of its sharing the same fictional universe as Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate.  Besides the main school club story, a dark conspiracy with worldwide implications lurks just beneath the surface.  Definitely will be picking up Part 2 when it comes out.",1396396800,,373,4.707692307692308
6105855,5,B00GS1JRPY,"These day's many Anime Titles take themselves far to seriously, or don't take themselves seriously enough.  Robotics: Notes is a series that allows you, the audience, to just sit back and have some fun whilst at the same time enjoying a nice flowing story with healthy doses of hijinks without having to be worried about whether it is one of the other.  A little sci-fi, a portion of teenage romance, a bit of intrigue, a smidgen of humour all makes for an enjoyable story-line.",1395360000,7,478,4.678571428571429
6105856,5,B00GS1JRPY,"There's nothing negative I can say about it - Robotics: Notes was beyond good.  Right in line with Steins: Gate and the rest they are exemplary stories, excellent artwork, funny, serious - every thing possible wrapped into one show without making it a bit sloppy. And begging to be watched over and over.",1395273600,5,304,4.735849056603773

6105858,5,B00GS1JRPY,All i have to say is wow I'm really like this show i just can't wait for the second part to come out. If your thinking of buying this show i would say you should its funny.

8626619,5,B00GS1JRPY,"I bought this for my 12 yr old. My 8 yr old watched the whole series obsessively. So, clearly, it's OK for the younger set to watch, which not all anime (or any other kind of movie) is.

Also, VERY cool to see a girl excited about STEM and actively involved in it. She's the main driving force behind getting this robot built, running, and entered into a competition. Could be a great gift for the budding female scientist or engineer in your family or friends.

The series held the attention of everyone in the family. Good quality. Well written. Lots of fun to watch. We will get part 2.",1419292800,4,589,4.345454545454546
8626620,5,B00GS1JRPY,If you loved Choas;Head and Steins;Gate get ready for another trip into that world just only this time it's the near future this will be one of the most suprising animes you probably watch that involves mecha and mysterys. It's a must watch for all mystery fans. Plus the shipping was amazing I recieved my package 2 days earlier than expected.,1419206400,,344,4.655737704918033
