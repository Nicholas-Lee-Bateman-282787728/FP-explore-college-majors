8558121,2,B00AVZT0LE,"Pretty lame and painfully redundant sums it up nicely. This came today and I couldn't wait to watch. The DVD makes multiple references to the ""desire induction"" printed material that was said to accompany the ""tape"". I'm guessing the word tape dates this material and the newer DVD version doesn't come with any printed material. The only thing I learned from this DVD is that I should make one myself and sell it on Amazon. I've talked multiple women into orgasms over the internet. Not by typing, I use ""vent"" for private audio connections. If you know your way around a woman's body it's not hard to do if you're a patient person. I don't say that to brag as I have no need to impress anyone who may read this. The point is that the words paint pictures, the voice nails the auditory, and suggestion covers the kinaesthetic. All in all I have to say the Big O is a big NO. It got the second star strictly for anchoring. Wendi's ""How to Hypnotize Anyone"" DVD is pretty good and I gave it 4 stars. The advanced one also came today and I'll rate it tomorrow. It will do well to hit 3 stars but I'm going to watch it again without the lingering disappointment of The Big O hanging over it.",1360368000,4,1188,4.331838565022421
