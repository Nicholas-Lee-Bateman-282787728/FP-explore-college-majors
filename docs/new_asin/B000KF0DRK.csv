8155981,3,B000KF0DRK,"So I'm the first to review ""Sickness House""... Obviously an independent film characterized by its low budget, which is evident in the settings, ""special effects,"" and make-up effects, not to mention acting so bad that it hurt my feelings... Yet, I still kind of liked it. I must admit, I turned it off after the first five minutes, when I saw the ""doctor"" visit his patient in a clinic or private room that resembled somebody's kitchen. But... I had to see it with an open mind. Basically, two women visit deepest, darkest Africa on vacation and come back with more than for what they bargained. The illness finds its way to a New Year's Eve party and basically ruins everybody's night. Okay, so perhaps I'm holding on to this one because of its unintentional humor. Why are YOU going to hold on to it?",1282953600,3,802,4.576388888888889
