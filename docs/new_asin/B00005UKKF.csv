People say that she was lyp syncing---but they are wrong! I was there~!! This DVD will be packed with awesome performances and you will love every minute of it!!! And besides, it's Britney Spears! Who wouldn't love it (besides those few who hate her because they are so jealous it's scary!)!  Anyway, I wish that they had ten stars because it is worth that much and more! ENJOY!",1011139200,2,544,4.540816326530612
1665507,5,B00005UKKF,"I happened to be going to a conference in Vegas the week that Britney was performing at the MGM Grand. I heard Rosie O'Donnel Say on her show that she had just got tickets for the Britney show in Vegas on the 18th of November. Not paying much attention I quickly forgot all about it. The following day I got bored at work and while daydreaming I remembered what Rosie had said and thought, what the heck, ""I'll check out the ticket prices"", Figuring that they would be sold out for sure and I had no idea of when they went on sale. Much to my surprise they still had seats available, so I (just to see) typed in 2 seats and I could not believe that the seats were really good and not high priced considering what I have paid recently for concert tickets, like for Madonna. (well worth it though).
Anyway, bought the tickets, went to the show and although compared to the majority of those around me, I felt like a grandpa(I am 30). Even so, as much as I tried to act my age, before I knew it, I was up on my feet and feeling the energy.
I was not expecting much and have to say was embarrased to admit to anyone at home that I was even going. After her incredible show, I have admited to everyone that I am a fan of Britney Spears and you will be too, I guarantee it! I am sure the DVD will be less powerful than seeing it live, but just feel her amazing energy and see her for what she is, A young woman living out her dreams and allowing us to tag along! AMAZING!",1010534400,116,1465,4.072664359861592

1665510,3,B00005UKKF,"For those that love Britney Spears like me, you will love watching this concert. Britney Spears is legendary any way you look at it. She really only sings  ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"" in the movie, the rest you can just expect her to lip sync. It's very entertaining to watch her perform if you never had the opportunity to go to one of her ""live"" shows.",1484179200,,361,4.1571428571428575

In my opinion, this Dream Within a Dream tour was her greatest tour of all time. This was before anything ""crazy"" happened & before she misplaced her groove. With that being said, I highly reccomend attending her Piece of Me show if you're ever in Vegas. The B**** is back, baby! I've never seen a hotter show.

After watching this, I understand why she was and to some degree still is a great entertainer.  I know that she lip syncs but I can't imagine singing and dancing as hard as she does at the same time.  Actually, I really didn't care about her lip syncing, because she is an incredible dancer and really fun to watch.  BTW, I am over 50 and had no experience watching her or did not listen to her music.  I saw parts of this concert on youtube and was so blown away that I bought this dvd.  Let me just say that watching it on youtube and watching it on your own TV are two different things.  The in home experience is amazing.  She is a great entertainer and this concert is the reason she had and still has a huge following.",1398988800,6,853,4.152439024390244

1665550,5,B00005UKKF,"This DVD brings back so many memories.  It defines the era in which it was released.  The whole ""futuristic"" vibe is so funny to look back at.  It seems so retro but it was cool to see where Britney was back in those days!  I always find it so ironic that this concert featured a clip of her bald...kinda like telling the future which would come in 2007.  Overall, it's something that you need to own with your Britney collection if you are a fan.",1356652800,,447,4.211764705882353

1665552,4,B00005UKKF,"This DVD features Britney Spears at an appearance at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in 2001, during her Dream Within A Dream Tour.  Although Ms. Spears appears to be lip synching throughout much of the show, she and her crew of dancers deliver an energetic and exciting performance featuring most of her well known hits at the time.  Originally broadcast live on HBO, Britney wows the crowd in this 90 minute Emmy winning production.

A pop sensation since her debut in 1999, Britney Spears' meteoric rise in popularity has been built on more than just her talents as a singer, as her looks, dancing ability, and her evolving persona, have been incorporated into her music.  Spears is a talented dancer, and a fine stage performer in general, who seems to have grown up really fast from schoolgirl to sex symbol.  Befitting the huge venue at the MGM Grand, this show is about going big and making a huge splash, with a group of dancers supporting Spears in what are mostly energetic production numbers with impressive lighting and stage accoutrements.  A live broadcast with much at stake, made actually singing during these physically demanding dance routines impractical, so Spears lip synchs through almost the entire performance.  Even so she's hardly slacking off, ""singing"" and dancing through some complicated production numbers.  Judged by the audience's reaction, the popularity of the HBO broadcast, and DVD sales, her fans apparently have no major problems with Britney's performance.

This well staged production allows the energy level to rise and fall, and the mood to shift.  The stage at the MGM's Grand Garden Court is unique, and the performance makes good use of the unusually shaped stage, which has a long runway, and also features various trapdoors.  This is Vegas after all, and the show has all the glitz, glamour, and sex appeal, you might expect.

By the third song ""Overprotected"" Britney has hit her stride, performing in a circle of green lasers.  While Jon Voight provides an introduction, Britney makes her first costume change for ""Born To Make You Happy"" and ""Sometimes"", two of her less frenetic numbers.

It's time to get nasty, as the ensemble rocks through ""Boys"" and the fireworks explode on ""Stronger"" as Britney takes command of the stage by herself, before being joined by her troupe of Cirqueish male dancers.  The native of Louisiana engages with the audience, and pays her respects to the US military, before proceeding to ""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"", one of the few soft moments in the show.

Britney and her female dancers perform a rousing version of ""I Love Rock `N' Roll"" on a suspended platform.  The stage band gets to play for a while, as Britney and the dancers prep for the show's final numbers.  Britney emerges dressed in a white gown to perform ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"" on a raised circular stand, with smoke billowing from the bottom.  Performed to a dollhouse theme, the bouncy ""Anticipating"" is a little girl's fantasy gone wild, as Britney continues to keep the audience involved and engaged.  But Britney being Britney, she can't stay a good little girl for very long, and she proceeds into an extremely provocative rendition of ""I'm A Slave 4 U"".

The show closes with an encore, a spectacular and wet version of ""Baby One More Time"" which opens with water sprinkling down on the stage, as a hologram of Spears appears in the falling water.  Rocking again on that suspended platform, Britney and her dancers are soaked to the skin.  Closing the show in a boldly unique, and sexy fashion.

If you want to see Britney Spears in a glitzy musical extravaganza with lots of energetic dancing and edgy choreography, to the tune of prerecorded music, this is definitely the show for you.  While not a vocal performance in a true concert setting, Britney Spears works her butt off to entertain.  While perhaps intended equally for the eyes as well as the ears, if you are a Spears fan, that may not matter very much to you.  Unfortunately the DVD contains little in the way of extras, and it's disappointing that Britney never appears in the white glittered Elvis inspired jumpsuit, that is featured on the faade of the MGM Grand, and the DVD cover.",1328227200,,4216,4.811373092926491
1665553,5,B00005UKKF,The Britney I saw in this DVD has vanished. This concert is AMAZING. I recommend everyone to somehow watch this. P.S (I bought a copy on eBay for realllly cheap).,1312588800,2,162,4.433333333333334
1665554,5,B00005UKKF,"The DVD of the Dream Within a Dream tour is so visually beautiful to watch even my family members who aren't Britney Spears fans were watching it.  I admit, some of the song redentions were a bit hokey though.  At the time, this was Britney's most well produced tour.  Beautiful costumes, great dance routines in which Britney puts her heart and soul into, cool special effects, and just great overall energy.  At one point, she even takes a break to address the audience and what she says comes from the heart and really shows her sweet personality.

This DVD is also family friendly and doesn't contain any of the adults themes that were included in subsequent concert tours.",1299974400,,677,4.703389830508475
1665555,5,B00005UKKF,"Dream Within A Dream is one of the largest concerts Britney has put on and one of the most sucessful concert tours in the industry. Britney played to a completely sold out crowd in Las Vegas for her HBO special and it was just a spectacular feat of dance, production, and imagery. All of what you can always expect from the queen of pop herself, Britney Spears. This concert is also one of the best productions put on for a live show. It won an Emmy for HBO and was seen by millions of homes as one of HBO's most watched programs. It's still classic today to watch Britney move to the beat and become a ""Slave"" to the music as she performs all her hits. This is a def must have for any Britney fan!",1292198400,,698,4.139705882352941
1665556,3,B00005UKKF,I really like Britney but I must confess that this is not her best show. Even the audience showed lack of entusiasm during the performance.,1286236800,,139,4.6
1665557,5,B00005UKKF,"Britney has a world wide reputation as an established icon of the Pop Music industry. I personally believe that among professionals that today hold that view, it was this disk that made it impossible to ever believe anything else. The show is a classic example of everything coming together on the night, Britney is obviously at the peak of her professionalism and is completely unafraid to share it with her audience. Thoroughly recommended as the central show for anyone who wants to know, Who is the real Britney?

She doesn't she stand up on stage and sing, she is the definition of putting on a show. If you looked up ""show"" in the dictionary you'd see Britney's picture.

There is only one King Of Rock N Roll and that is Elvis Presley, get that suit of this trash bag ho before she insults his legacy just by wearing it.  Britney Spears is a manufactured, no talent, hack,  Elvis is The King there is a huge difference and why he got to wear his trademark suit.  Britney is nothing and this is an insult to Elvis, britney would maybe qualify as one of the King's groupies maybe.....thats as far as it goes.",1250035200,,512,4.247422680412371

I could tell that she wanted to give a great performance to her audiences and viewers. Britney Spears Live From Las Vegas is an awesome performance and to watch it on an 42"" inch flat screen makes me feel like I'm right there standing right next to Elvis who just happened to be in the audience. Elvis Is In The House! I love all the songs she sang, the dancing and her costume changes, but most of all I just love Britney! This video of her performance shows us when she was at her peak as a performer before her life started to spiral out of control. I would recommend this dvd to anyone who love, like or just curious about Britney you will not be disappointed.

This is a filmed version of her widely successful ""Dream Within A Dream"" Tour to promote '...Baby One More Time', 'Oops!...I Did It Again', and 'Britney'.  Alot of people claim that Britney ripped off other artists to create this tour, I highly disagree.  Britney took parts of her favortie artists' tours and mixed it all together to make her own.  This tour is not a ripoff of anyone, but a tribute at certain points while being strongly Britney's own show.

I purchased this expecting it to be cool, but not AMAZING! I never thought that anyone could equal any of Madonna's concerts, but in terms of entertainment and fun, I think Britney surpassed Madonna's tours.

You won't be dissapointed if you buy this.",1195603200,,784,4.727941176470588
1665572,5,B00005UKKF,"This DVD is actually pretty good. It has the links to either watch the full show or to watch each performance separately.

Britney Spears gives a really good show in this HBO live from Las Vegas presentation. Her songs are very catchy and the cameras are very good on following her and catching good close ups to Britney and her dancers.

This DVD has a really cool beginning, as well as a fun little band video. Britney and her team really ran the extra mile with this concert as it's really entertaining. It has really good choreographed dances, as well as special effects, and lots of costume changes. Also you get to see at least one Elvis there in the mix.

While the show starts with fire explosions and very high teck looking. It ends really cool with rain and a very nice sensual ""baby one more time"" that I kind of like better than the original one.

It's a fun concert, didn't find any mistakes on this one, defiantly one of Britney's greatest concerts or her time.",1182038400,,975,4.46067415730337
1665573,5,B00005UKKF,"Unlike today (May 2007), Britney's public image was riding high at this point and her tight clothes, amazing body and sexy dance moves are completely erotic. She is so unbelievably seductive and sensuous!! Her confidence and energy are infectious.

I just have one question: What in HELL is Jon Voight doing here??????? Jon Voight was famous 10 years before Britney was born, for crying out loud. He's an anachronism here.

But seriously! Not to mention, his little segment was hokey and silly, embarrassing and painful to watch, and it was a distraction from the substance of the rest of the show. Maybe Britney (or her management) was trying too hard to show her wholesome side. No one came to this concert (and no male bought it) to watch Jon Voight read a story to a little girl.

I'm surprised there was no audible booing at that point. I have owned the videotape for some time, but I think the DVD would be even better!

I also strongly recommend her Greatest Hits DVD for sexy alternative versions of some of her videos.",1180656000,,1027,4.657458563535911

1665575,4,B00005UKKF,"I have to admit to being a new Britney fan. I never got into her work until recently when I was listening to a trance remix of one of her songs and all of a sudden I got her music! Don't say she can't sing...the emotional nuances, the tone, and the true sensuality are all rich. You don't sell fifty million records by just being cute to look at, and you don't have to posses the vocal range of an opera singer to be a good singer. You have to mean what you are doing. That said, this dvd shows off the result of what must be ten years of hard work by someone who seems to be a born performer. It's not all my cup of tea but it's one concert dvd that should be in a lot of peoples collections. All performers in it did a top job.",1156464000,2,729,3.8666666666666667

I saw her in London in the UK, she was still preformed a Unbelievable show on DVD and was just like watchin her when i did in London. By the way, Britney does sing some songs live, like 'Baby One More Time', 'Not A Girl Not Yet A Women' and 'Sometimes' and the reason why she Occasionally does not sing live is because she jumps around and dances and would be out of breathe qucikly... so for that reason she can sing live!!!

A realy excellent buy!!! would recommend to any Britney fans!!!",1143331200,3,638,4.229508196721311
1665578,3,B00005UKKF,"Although this is a good concert and tour (arguably Britney's best), its certainly not ""the best"" of all time, as described by other reviewers.

Take away the fancy stage sets, the pyro and other special effects and you're basically left with nothing. Being a good performer is more than just gimmick. (Anyone is capable of that). If you can't entertain without those props backing you up, how good are you an entertainer? All of Michael Jackson's concerts contain nothing more than his stand up microphone and his band, and yet he still can leave you mesmerized beyond belief after the performance is over. Would Britney be able to do that? I very readily doubt so.

If you liked this tour, you'll probably enjoy Janet Jackson's 1997 'The Velvet Rope' tour. Britney borrowed a few things from this concert, most noticeably, the costumes for her back-up dancers during ""Stronger"" were clearly taken from the ones from ""You"". Janet not only delivers fun dance songs (""Escapade"", ""Nasty,"" ""When I think of you,"" etc), but also gives you something with substance and a message as well, with performances of ""Rhythm Nation"", ""What About"", ""You"" among others - its the full spectrum. Not just pop fluff. That is something the 'Dream Within A Dream' tour lacks sourly. Though I suppose, this is not to say it is Britney's fault, for she doesn't sing those type of songs in the first place.

'The Velvet Rope' tour may not have video montages and giant waterfalls like this one, but it'll dazzle you just the same...if not, more.",1143158400,,1521,4.819923371647509

She throws the most entertaining concerts, especially this one in Las Vegas. I haveto admit that she does lipsync on some songs but HOW IS SHE SUPPOSED TO DO HER BAD ASS DANCES!

1665586,3,B00005UKKF,"I had mixed feelings after viewing Britney Spears' Live from Las Vegas! HBO concert special.  First off, there was hardly any amazing choreography for this show, something that Spears usually has a plethora of.  Second, her rendition of her ballady single ""Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know"" sounded a little too deep, low, and Toni Braxton-like for my liking (let alone unnatural for Britney - did the microphone not process her voice right?).  Third of all, the effects --though amazing in scale-- could confuse as easily as the questioning over Britney's ""assetts.""  Britney's touching tribute to our nation's armed forces did add a tish of realness to the typically-fabricated Miss Spears.  Overall, a good but not amazing show.",1114041600,,731,5.058333333333334
1665587,5,B00005UKKF,"I was not a fan of Britney Spears before I saw this show on November 2001 on HBO. I had lived in Las Vegas, NV and moved out of there that summer. On Thanks Giving Day, while the rest of my family was getting ready and leaving to another family member's house to celebrate Thanks Giving Day, I stayed at home to get ready. It was late and so I turned on the TV, it always makes me feel better, well it was on HBO when Britney's show was going on. It was live from Las Vegas and it catched my eye, since I had lived there. I decided to give the show a couple of minutes to see what was going on and then I would head to the shower. But I didn't I was hocked by her performance! she was so energetic and there was so much going on, from cips of her band to her big screen presentation. Then she would be singing all of these songs and change clothes very fast. She would be flying in the air and dancing and well she was and still is VERY HOT!

Well it was this show that made me want to see more of Britney, it made me notice that she was not only a singer but a performer too.

Ever since I've been wanting to go to one of her concerts but I sadly miss her last one. I foudn out that it was going to be shown on MTV but I had to work duirng the airing dates of the show. I can't wait till they turn it into a DVD for me to see.",1108684800,3,1327,3.752688172043011

She did a lot of costume changes. She did a lot of songs from her three albums.  The show starts off with a dream, then builds up in momentum.  Spears does lip-sync on a few songs, but I happened to hear her band more than the record she was lip-synching over.  That concert proved that Britney is a dynamic performer and entertainer.  I hope they make a concert DVD of the Onyx Hotel tour that she did in the spring of this year. The Las Vegas element is why this concert is full of the excess and the big lights circling and swinging all across that stage.",1103414400,3,736,4.266187050359712

So please give her a break and stop this silly stupid and childish lies. Regarding, this concert yes I would agree it is obvious that some of her numbers were lip-sync and that I would advice her management to open up their eyes to let Britney sing live from start to finish. Yes, definetely dancing and singing at the same time is a difficult task but common britney will be motivated not only by 100 millions of dollars but by the ""Love and Respect"" of her fans who are truly depending on her and who serves as an inspiration to them.

I knew Britney was going to mime, but I didn't expect her to mime THE ENTIRE THING.

She is good at dancing though. If she doesn't want to get so puffed out on stage I suggest that she should quit smoking.

She doesn't sing any of the 16 songs, except ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"", that's the only song she sings in the whole concert, but the concert itself is great!

The stage where she ""performs"" is awesome, with fireworks, bunji flights, a ""flying stage"" in some songs, and the most amazing of all is the rain in the stage (of coure the people don't ger wet) in Baby One More Time. There's something else I have to object: the DVD does not include any special featurette!

In other countries, the DVD includes 3 music videos (I'm A Slave 4 U, Overprotected and I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman) and the Crossroads movie trailer. The DVD is great, and the new versions for some of the songs are awesome, the only one bad thing is that she doesn't sing almost any of the songs.

1665601,1,B00005UKKF,"For all of the praise and acclaim that Britney Spears receives from the media and from fans worldwide (what they see in her, I still don't know), there isn't much Spears has done to justify it - basically she comes off to me as someone that got by on pure luck rather than talent. She can't sing a note in tune, her dancing is substandard, the songs are accompanied by cheesy outdated sequencers, and the lyrics are nothing short of abominable - and this DVD proves it.  If the vocals have a pre-recorded sound to them, that's because they WERE pre-recorded - Spears is lip-synching throughout the whole ""live"" performance!
I'm sure Spears is aware of her many shortcomings - she hopes to distract everyone from them by wearing as little clothing as possible, including plenty of gratuitous cleavage shots (A note to parents: Keep this in mind when one of your children asks for this DVD). If there's anything I'll give her credit for, she sets a record for the amount of outfit changes she goes through during her performance - and that's about all I'll give her credit for. This DVD is all the proof you need that she is a lip-synching flunky and an average dancer at best - the only thing she's got going for her is her sex appeal, but that shouldn't translate to a successful career in the music industry.
In summary: This DVD is not worth your time or money. Spears can't decide whether she wants to appeal to children (through her cheesy bubblegum pop songs) or teenage boys and unmarried middle-aged men (through her revealing outfits), and comes up with something that's a complete waste of time, totally lacking purpose or substance. Basically, combine Teletubbies with a movie like ""Showgirls"", and you have Britney Spears: Live From Las Vegas in a nutshell - a concept that is as ridiculous as it is pointless.",1084406400,5,1821,4.672897196261682

Finally, the sound is VERY GOOD, BUT the tracks that were used on the concert were the same tracks from her album, so if you want to hear her songs then buy the CD, don't spend more money on the DVD is not worth it, at least they should have made a good mix for the concert, not putting the same tracks for her to lipsync.",1069804800,4,872,4.388888888888889

Yes, Britney wows the audience with her dancing, special effects, and filmed sequences, but these are all things I've seen before in many, many shows. Britney does serve her purpose for going out there and putting on a big show, but hearing the backing tracks that play on her CDs in the background and her lipsynching is not very interesting. After a while you get tired of it. Then comes the ballad and Britney tries her hardest to make the audience believe that she is a real singer, but it comes off very forced and almost painful (I'm going by her facial expressions as she sings). I'm not trying to bash Britney Spears, but writhing around on the floor soaking wet is not my idea of a great show - we've seen all of this before from her and others, so it's nothing new and exciting.

she puts into her act, but the bottom line after all her effort is how good of a show she really puts on.
I'll save you a lengthy read by saying this: if you like watching people dance this DVD is for you.
If you like hearing people sing then this DVD is not for you.
Despite what people say Britney does not purely lip synch.
Her voice is there in the mix as well as a the recorded version of her voice. Technically she sings along with herself, and her ""live"" vocal is put very low in the mix or removed completely when she has to dance strenously.
Every entertainer who dances does this: Janet, Madonna, Cher, etc...so let's not condemn Brit for doing what has been a standard practice for years now.
The rub on Brit is the fact that she does it for every song except the solo piano number. Most of the other stars mentioned don't use it as much, and in Madonna's case not at all anymore.
If you want to see the epoch of the teen pop boom of the late 1990s then this is the show for you.
My two criticisms: Her choreographer is uninspired and consequently her dance moves look like everyone elses.
The spoken owrd interlude w/ Jon Voight was a bad idea.
It's confusing and poorly staged.
Completely unecessary.",1028592000,11,1275,4.2727272727272725
1665667,3,B00005UKKF,"I don't know, i dind't like this performance at all.  The thing is that she tried being too ""sexy"" and it limit her as an artist. She was lipsyncing the whole time, If i wanted to hear her sing like that, i would just put her cd on and listened to it .  Also what's up with the weird costumes and the walking around?  She use to dance in unison with her dancers instead of standing around feeling on herself.  Big disappointment!",1028592000,2,429,4.195121951219512
1665668,1,B00005UKKF,"This would have to be the worst performance I have seen in a very long time. Britney lip-synced almost every song. Her tired dance moves echoed Madonna and Janet Jackson's early 90's performances.
It has been clear to many for a long time that Britney does not have a very strong voice and it is proven here. The songs also seem to all be part of medleys (performed mostly at under 3 minutes). Too much time and money is spent on costumes and set. Basiaclly it's a live music video. Also can't help but be a little confused by the whole 12 year old girl thing for one song and then the grown up wannabe madonna for the next???
The show is cheap. The DVD quality is very good. Britney is very bad live (even with pre-recorded vocals) and all the songs seem to have the same beat, same sounds and same formula ( intro / verse / chourus / verse / chourus / bridge-verse / altered chourus / chourus with ad lib / end ...",1028246400,5,916,4.2102272727272725

The best parts of the show are when she bungee jumps and when it rains(she wears a different outfit than she does on the HBO special).  The dance moves are great(even though she could cut down on the dancing and do some more live singing).  She does sing live some though, it's not ALL lip syncing.

It shows up close what you don't get to see at the concert...unless you have seats right on the stage. Britney does lip sync in concert on some of the faster songs, and you can tell in the video, but she dances so awesome that it just makes up for it!  If you're looking to buy it because of her ""singing ability"" then don't, because you'll be disappointed by the appearance of lip syncing, but if you want to see how awsome she is onstage then it's a must have.  The video was spectacular and made me want to see her in person.",1027555200,,650,4.0625

She is a great dancer and although alot of the songs are lip synced it does not matter because i do not know anyone who can dance like that and keep a not.  Her voice is shown in Her slower songs.  If you really want her to sing you can not see her dance well.  Madonna did it, Janet Jackson did it so why not Britney.  The concert is excellent and critics need to base it on a professional level not a personal level.  Well overall it is very entertaining.  Great for a party, to play in the background while you have fun.  Buy the DVD.",1026864000,,677,4.068181818181818

I have to say I'm an unstoppable and more than enthusiast fan of Britney's, but not only because she is a great performer/entertainer, she can dance amazingly, she's really beautiful; I'm also deeply convinced all her songs are truly outstanding and she's got an incredible voice: if you don't believe me, listen to such tracks as ""Born To Make You Happy"", ""Where Are You Now?"" or, in the Japanese version of ""Britney"", ""Before The Goodbye"": with her voice she can do things that never stop giving me goose bumps!!!!
Well, I don't know whether she lip-syncked or not during part of the concert, but I know SHE SURE CAN SING!!!! And I think she generally doesn't lip-syncs in concerts: Mariah Carey was at one of the dates of the tour and said HER VOICE CAN KEEP A GREAT COMPOSURE AND SHE DOESN'T LIP-SYNC AT ALL!!!! Believe good ol' Mariah!!!
And for those who say it is just a show, not a concert, I think THIS IS what all concerts should be: otherwise, what is the difference between listening to the singer performing her songs live and listening to the CD at home, beyond being close to the artist in the first case?
Britney is THE ONE AND ONLY QUEEN OF MUSIC and she will enjoy more and more success now and in the years, decades, centuries, ... to come, because that's what she deserves for her incredible contribution to music and her presence on earth!!!",1022371200,,1487,4.511111111111111

We all know Britney can make excellent videos, and we all know she can't sing that well live, but it does not matter because the one thing Britney can do is put on an incredible show. Britneys at her best on her Dream Within a Dream Live From Vegas tour. From the opening Oops...I Did It Again she will have you hooked as she performs each and everyone of her hits. The choreography, staging, costumes, and special affects are breathtaking. I do widh she would sing live, but then a part of me doesn't. Its not about what she sounds like or even the songs themselves, its the perfect performance of them that matters. She is an entertainer and she soars at entertaining. Highlights include the funky Boys, Overprotected, and What Its Like To Be Me, The finale of Baby One More Time is the most sexually charged performance with Britney getting drenched as rain pours down on the stage.

Watching this DVD is like reliving the experience!...She sounds good, yes, it is live!..Just with a vocal track....she is a great dancer...and just a good entertainer all around.

Fans always saying ""That's not a point, the point is she's stage presence and talent"" Well...remember, she's a well-trained-by-a-big-company-performer. how anyone can be a talented singer if he or she doesn't singing at all?
I coudn't find any musical elements in this massive show, It really feels like watching a big music video, not a 'concert'
Aside from that big disappoinment. It's a very enjoyable show. fun to watch...That's why I give it a 3 star. Recommended if you are dedicated fan of her, or fan of visually well-constructed show like me. But don't expect any musical experience.
If you looking for a concert has both 'show' and real 'Music' at the same time, then try Madonna's 'Drowned the world tour' DVD.

1665709,5,B00005UKKF,"I hesitated to buy this dvd for quite sometime.  I wasn't sure whether she could have pulled something off half way decent with such a mediocre dance director WadeJo.  I almost felt ashamed to had put this concert down without seeing it in person or television after watching it in its entirety for the first time.  She is definitely one of our generation's most entertaining spectacles.  Although she lyp-synched through her best hits to date, she captured the screen with such presence not even her best lookin dancers could manage.  Highlights include, ""ops.."", ""overprotected"", ""boys"", ""I love rock and roll"", ""lonely"", ""Slave"", and no doubt ""...baby one more time.""  Probably 3 of the highlights are worth watching over and over.  The energy of ""i love rock and roll"" is incredible.  The album cut is mediocre at best but the live version is just pure fun and class.  The funk fused ""boys"" should be heavily considered for single release after ""overprotected.""  BUt the last, encore performance of ""...baby one more time""..i don't have words to describe it.  It was erotic, teasing, artistic..etc.  If u thought her vma performance of ""ops..i did it again"" was incredibl, u'd no doubt love this.  this is far from perfect for example the cheesy production behind ""anticipating"" and her two best (but mediocre) ballads from her last two albums: ""dont let me be the last to know"" and ""not a girl, not yet a woman.""  ""Lonely"" in addition didn't sound as sharp as the album cut.  But the sound quality of the dvd is top notch.

The DVD of her concert made me feel like I was seeing it live again.  It was taped of the show that was the day before my concert.

I have seen some concerts in my time, including Madonna's 'The Girlie Show', Janet Jackson's 'The Velvet Rope Tour', and this concert is far better than any I have attended before. Not only is she a talented performer, with a passion for her art, but she also comes across as a genuine and warm-hearted person. The energy evident in her performer is electric, there isn't a dull moment in the whole performance. I guarantee you will be entertained from beginning to end.

1665713,5,B00005UKKF,"Yes, pop star Britney Spears has another DVD out this year. Besides past ""Live and More"", ""Britney The Videos"" and ""Time out with..."". This one takes the taco. Britney performs her ""Dream Within A Dream"" 2001 tour LIVE at the MGM Grand Garden Arena - November 2001. The MGM has seen its share of great artists. Barbra Streisand held her Millennium Concert there.
This concert is spectacular for all Spears fans. The choreography, the back-up track, the special effects, and the whole thing. Britney performes hits from her 3 albums ""...Baby One More Time"", ""Oops!...I Did It Again"", and ""Britney"". Britney has never disapointed me, and for that, she has millions of fans. Recently her little mishap in the UK didn't help for her persona, but, who can blame her. I'd be the same way!
""OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN""
This number opens the concert. It is naturally lip-sunc, but if you listen closely you can hear Britney sing a little. It's a great start.
""(YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY""
Remixed. Britney usually opens with this number. She tackles this one with tuns of dance moves and all pure Britney.
""OVERPROTECTED""
The newest single for the USA. This is performed as the album version. This is my favorite track off of the ""Britney"" album.
""MEDLEY:""
a) Born To Make You Happy
b) Lucky
c) Sometimes
This Medley basically gets rid of the ""...Baby One More Time"" and ""Oops!...I Did It Again"" album hits. It's nice to have a Britney medley!
""BOYS""
This is a FUNKY song. It's a R&B-type dance track. Britney is very sexy.
""STRONGER""
One of my most favorite songs. The dancing is increadible!
""I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN""
Britney sang A LITTLE BIT on this track. It's very beautiful.
""I LOVE ROCK 'N' ROLL""
This is more fast than the album version. It's funky.
""WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME""
The Britney-Justin song, since they recently broke up I'm sure she's not very thrilled about it. I like what it has to say.
""LONELY""
This track or ""Boys"" is bound to be a single off of the album.
""DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW""
My absolute favorite Britney song. I wish she would have performed it because she can perform the hell out of it!
""ANTICIPATING""
A Disco-type track. It's in a CRAYOLA type of background.
""I'M A SLAVE 4 U"" (Encore)
Very sexy and better than the album version. It's like the MTV Music Awards 2001.
""...BABY ONE MORE TIME"" (Encore)
This BIG-WET encore. A nice end to the show!
For the retards out there that think Britney won't be around for a long time...THINK AGAIN. She'll always be around. I LOVE YOU BRITNEY!",1017619200,31,2515,4.578713968957872

Yes, she does lip-sync, but let's face it, it takes nothing away from the production. You will be utterly amazed by the special effects at this concert and her dancing is superb. The music still sounds great whether she's singing or not. Plus, with all those dance moves, you can't blame her for needing to lip sync. I'm one of those who would rather sacrifice the voice for the production.
I was lucky enough to see this Las Vegas show in person, and the DVD does a great job of capturing the concert. In fact, I was able to get an even better view of all I had missed. Only things missing from the DVD are special features and a multiple-angle viewing option.

(You can even see the piano player count 1,2,3 so Britney knows when the audio will kick in.)

If Madonna can dance around the stage and be thrown up in the air and still manage to sing most of her songs then Britney can do the same thing.  Only excuse is that her vocals stink without the help of a studio.

The DVD will be just as disappointing as the actual concert if you except a real live performance.  If you've already got her CD's then you can turn off the volume while watching the DVD and pump up your stereo.",1012262400,11,1084,4.223300970873787

When Your whipping you head and moving all the time like she does you try singing, trust me, i would rather hear prerecorded vocals. She did awesome, and she looked great, its nice to know she is not holding anything back, and regardless of what people have to say, she does not care. She has matured, and whether you like her or hate her, she is a damn good performer. I love you Britney!",1011657600,,500,4.21875
1665741,5,B00005UKKF,"Britney Spears is really an awesome performer. She can definately dance, you have to admit that! She is also a good singer. Just cause you all wish you could sing like her doesn't mean you have to put her down. I know you're wishing you had all the money she makes. And if you think people only like her so they can see her so called ""Half Naked"" body, then why did I think 2 of her albums go like Platinum? Its not like each CD shows her performing! Millions of people buy her CD's because she has talent. And the reason why in concerts she sings ALONG with the recording is because if she sang while breaking out with her awesome choreography, you would hear her voice be shaky because she can't do both at once. However, even as she said in an interview, shes still up their singing her bottom off. So please, if for some reason you want to put down an awesome performer like her, just keep it to yourself. She is good. Anyways, about the DVD, I saw it on HBO and I went to her concert in Atlantic City ((which was identical to the LV one)) and it was awesome! She sings songs from her new ablum, along with songs from Oops!...I Did It Again and ...Baby One More Time! It's a must have! Thanks",1011657600,6,1196,4.181818181818182
1665742,5,B00005UKKF,"When I saw the concert, I was amazed!!!  This is something you should definetely plan on buying...
The music is fun and the whole visuals were extremely interesting.  The dances were awesome, the best I've seen.  There's lots of stuff. Britney on a box,  on top of a flying platform, flying on air, driving a car, cool costumes, out of this world dance routines, colorful sets, ballet, piano, rain and lots of other stuff.  You should absolutely purchase this...",1011657600,3,462,4.7974683544303796

7954647,5,B00005UKKF,I've been a huge Britney fan since I was like 10 years old and I am 26...I had this on tape but no longer have a VHS player. It was a great flashback experience I think this was her best tour and that's why she has performed in Las Vegas so much. Her dance moves were perfect she used to dance so amazingly! She is older now and I don't expect her to do so well but oh well. I will always be a fan of hers!,1519430400,,406,3.67816091954023
7954648,5,B00005UKKF,"This Britney Spears concert is absolutely amazing! In fact, it's not just a concert, it's a spectacle. The special effects, the costumes,the stage, the singing, the dancing, the costumes, just everything is perfect and visually stunning! Britney performs all of her hits from her first three albums and all of the songs from BOMT and OIDIA were remixed just for this tour! Britney really leaves it all out on the stage and gives everyone a reminder why she was the only female teen idol that really mattered during the teen pop craze of the late 90s and early 2000's! If you want to be entertained, I suggest buying this DVD! You won't regret it!",1517270400,,646,4.675438596491228

7954652,2,B00005UKKF,I really prefer Live in Hawaii which I have and glad I bought but I just got this and kinda felt unfulfilled after watching it . She doesn't really dance here like the Hawaii DVD and obviously lots of lip sync . Im dissapointed that these days she doesn't keep the original song or choreography for her classic smash hits like BOMT n OIDIA if she did it would of been memorable and worth buying the DVD. As a fan I just hate that she's so ashamed of her inoccent days . But anyway only bought it cuz I love her so much. Smh,1505347200,,523,4.038461538461538
