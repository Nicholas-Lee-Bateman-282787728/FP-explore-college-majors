4312548,5,B004AXPWH4,I originally got a work out tape like this one free out of a Special K box several years ago.  This is close to the old one.  Easy to do and works.,1380672000,2,147,3.5625
4312549,3,B004AXPWH4,"I have probably 5 Jessica Smith workouts and I love them all!  She is encouraging without being annoying.  She is the perfect size and weight in my mind - the picture of health.  And her tapes are tough!  So I thought this could be a good hidden find.  Unfortunately 3 of the 4 10 minute segments in this tape are just cut out of her other workouts.  The only new one was at the end as far as I could tell and that one was definitely easier.  The first three are from her boot camp and kick box 10 minute solution videos.  The video is marketed as losing a jeans size in a certain amount of time so the focus is definitely more on the legs, buns and hips.  The original videos are more total body.  One advantage is for those people who aren't satisfied unless they do a whole video and don't have time to do 50 minutes on the other 10 minute solution videos.  This one is just 40 minutes.",1356739200,6,889,4.1104651162790695
