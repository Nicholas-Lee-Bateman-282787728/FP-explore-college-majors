 BAAZIGAR: LOVE this movie! Be prepared if you are a Shah Rukh Khan fan that this is a dark role for him. The first time I saw this movie, I just hated it. He wasn't his usual romantic, chipper Raj or Rahul. Well, in some scenes he is, and that's, I guess, what makes it even more creepy. He plays a psycho really well, but I found myself feeling very sorry for him because of circumstances that lead to his behavior. It is also a remake of the Hollywood film, A Kiss Before Dying starring Robert Wagner and Joanne Woodward. SRK does a brilliant job in this movie, and it is also Shilpa Shetty's first movie role.

YES BOSS: An ok movie, but I like it because it is an early movie of SRK's. I just had a hard time with him being too devoted to his boss, but it was all good in the end.

BAADSHAH: Love this movie too! It shows SRK's slapstick sense of humor--he's very good at it. The whole point of the story is mistaken identities, which makes for some hilarious moments. Some parts though are way too silly, such as when he and his buddies pretend to give SRK's character eye surgery. I usually ffw through that part because I can't take that much silliness, but the rest of the movie is great. It's got lots of action, the comedy of course, the songs are really great--I especially love Baadshah--and the scene at the end I think is taken from one of Jackie Chan's movies (another of my heroes!), although I can't remember which one. Anyway, a very entertaining film.

JOSH: A remake of West Side Story, Romeo & Juliet, those types of movies. I really like this movie alot--lots of action, and I think SRK is really sexy as the gang leader--his mannerisms, clothes and I don't know, everything about his character in this! All the acting was very good in this, and then there's the scenery (Goa), and the songs are all memorable and great.

KABHI HAAN KABHI NAA: Good movie, not his best in my opinion, but SRK is cute as his young self. I thought only one of the songs was good, not great, but good. The ending surprised me, but then I decided it was a good ending, with a surprise cameo of someone (that was good).

SWADES: This movie is really different from most of his other movies, as it deals with social issues in India. It is still very good, and is an uplifting film even though at a couple parts it's very sad to see the problems that they face over there. I only found 2 songs that are catchy and that I liked, especially when he is on the road on the way to the village where he will be staying. That's a great song! I also loved the part where Gita is showing Mohan, SRK's character, how to wear a dhoti, which she does for him. I think it's a very good part showing their closeness, but at the same time not too serious.

So all in all, getting all of these movies is great, since there is not one flop among them.",1338768000,5,2963,4.204225352112676
