8166265,5,B000M4LU1C,"I purchased this to possibly use with our church's VBS this summer on the persecuted church (Kids of Courage). It is about a group of youth who have a school report coming up on North Korea and one of their youth leaders gives them first hand information from a trip he went on to North Korea. It covers past and current (when filmed) country history as well as how Christians were and are treated in North Korea. My favorite parts are the parts about the Scripture balloon launches that are done to try to bring the Bible to North Korean people and learning about an ongoing problem of North Korean children trying to escape across a frozen river to China so they can have enough food to eat. I honestly had no idea how hard life in North Korea is. The DVD does not cover it in a way that leaves one feeling hopeless, though. We will definitely be using it somehow during VBS, but most likely not showing it to our preschoolers and youngest elementary kids. I still have to decide which kids are just a little too young in my opinion. This video is very inspiring and helpful for teaching us how to pray for North Koreans.",1393545600,,1123,4.37799043062201
