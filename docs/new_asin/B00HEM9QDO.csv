6156583,4,B00HEM9QDO,What a collection!!!,1409443200,,20,6.0
6156584,2,B00HEM9QDO,"First off, these ""Best of"" sets have always had a bad reputation since 2011, and it's worth mentioning that 2009 was the evident downfall of the series.  Strangely enough, you think a series would only get better with time but that seems to be the reverse.  Well, I'd be hard pressed to say it was worse but I certainly wouldn't say the series has been getting better.

Now, if you've looking at the reviews so far you should know not to buy the DVD format of this collection as it's nothing but the highlight reel (how insulting...).  So, there's really nothing left to say about that.  Unfortunately, since the blu-ray contains the same highlight reel I can't be anything but disappointed.  And while the ""bonus fights"" are the real reason for getting this release I thought it was odd that no one has pointed out the fact that the blu-ray itself doesn't offer the fights in blu-ray audio.  Instead it's delivered in the 2.0 audio which is barely what is served on the DVD.  Worse than that, whoever did the editing for this release made it so most of the fights get drowned out by the commentators as well as crowds.  The actual sounds that one hears during a live broadcast are muffled out and it sounds absolutely terrible.  If you watched the live Rousey/Tate II fight like I did you would remember that each time Rousey delivered a judo throw there was a distinct slam.  That is not present in the blu-ray release.  Another example is when Dan Henderson receives the head kick from Vitor Belfort that caused his first TKO.  There was a distinctive crack during the blow that isn't heard in the blu-ray release.  It's mistakes like this that make WWE production look amazing.  Say what you will about WWE but they know how to produce a good blu-ray without losing any of the quality in the release.  Unfortunately, it seems that the same cannot be said for the UFC and it's releases.

The saving grace of this release is the bonus fights (once again) and it's really unfortunate that the proper production cannot be put into these releases.  It almost makes the sales of the DVDs and blu-rays a joke.",1407283200,5,2106,4.5855614973262036

6156587,2,B00HEM9QDO,"If you have never purchased a best of something, don't waste your time, it is segmented, and choppy, I was expecting to see fight of year, knockout of the year, submission of the year and some of the best fights of the year, more often I got a couple of minutes of the fight, and there were quite a few fights they just referenced too, I will not be purchasing another one, it gets two stars because I am a UFC fan",1396915200,9,414,4.060975609756097
6156588,3,B00HEM9QDO,"Every time I watch one of these I want my damn money back. Every time I buy them I think they'll be different and every time I'm wrong. Other than the bonus portion, every ""fight"" is about 30-120 seconds of a fight and they move on to the next! It eats me up that I pay money for this!!!!!!!!!!",1396828800,3,294,4.0
6156589,2,B00HEM9QDO,"Waaoooww!! In a bad way. I know that the quality of the UFC Best of .... series is declining but I hope that they will fix that but ouch... I'm totally wrong. Since now on, I will never get any UFC Best of.. Series anymore. Lesson learned. Why?

First, it's only 1 disc which last about 90 minutes. Usually at least we get 2 discs which last much longer. With this problem, it brings us to ...

Second, no full fight at all!!

Third, they don't edit properly for many great key moves (Werdum vs. Nogueira for the armbar, Pettis vs. Henderson 2 for the armbar, Aldo vs. Korean Zombie for the shoulder dislocation, Weidman vs. Silva 2 for the broken leg, and a lot more)

Fourth, they don't even give the proper highlights of the fights! Instead they showcase more of where the hold the events and how the buildings look at where they host the event, they showcase the crowds, and they showcase the fighters' walk ins??!! Instead they can use all of those 25 seconds before each fight to at least show the fights highlights properly! OR just at least give extra 30 minutes to that one disc duration to show the proper highlights. They only give us the last 45-90 seconds of each fight and the narrator tells us about how great was their first two rounds, or their first four rounds, blah blah blah.... when they show buildings, crowds, walk ins, winners raising hands and smiling, etc. Basically, you can watch more highlight at YouTube clips than on this UFC: Best of 2013!

Overall a big disappointment! The UFC itself is a great company who make MMA sport as popular and great as it is now but man, the Best of .... DVD series really going downhill at full speed. I strongly recommend to all to avoid it at all cost. They seem to not care about UFC: Best of Series anymore period. The regular DVDs are way better and if you like highlights, the chance are way bigger for you to find them at YouTube than this DVD! Seriously!

One last thing though, even as disappointed as me right now, I try to be objective. This UFC: Best of 2013 is only good if you're a big fan or hard core fan of MMA who has missed out all your access to UFC news ultimately on year 2013, then this DVD will do good for you only for the news itself. Don't expect any great full fight, not even a great highlight of a fight, just expect the last 45-90 seconds of fight, that's it. So they should change the DVD series name to UFC 2013 flashback or review, that's it.

If it's titled UFC Best of 2013 then it's easily 2 star rating. Save your money for the regular UFC DVDs.",1396396800,6,2546,4.313807531380753
6156590,5,B00HEM9QDO,"I recived only one disc 85 minutes, and when I bought it it said TWO DISCS 300 MINUTES,  what can I do to recive for what I paid!",1395964800,,129,3.607142857142857
6156591,4,B00HEM9QDO,"Must give credit where credit is due. The blu-ray has almost every fight I was hoping would be included as full fights.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a five-star rating is the complete lack of bonus features. Would it kill the UFC to include a basic behind-the-scenes featurette? Also the blu-rays are still kind of glitchy from a functional standpoint. The fight list menu still freezes quite a bit, which is a real pain in the ass. And I really wish the tech geeks who put these things together would format the blu-ray so you could skip ahead and watch one fight without having the disc reboot and revert back to the main bonus fight menu. If you want to watch the fights at the bottom half of the list, you have to hit ""play all"" and skip through every round of the fights that precede the fights at the bottom of the list.

...oh well.",1395792000,4,855,4.3375
6156592,1,B00HEM9QDO,"The UFC is laughing at you.

That's right...YOU.

There are exactly ZERO bonus fights on the 2013 best of dvd. Last year there were ten full fights included. It was even more in previous years. I don't know exactly what Zuffa's business strategy is supposed to be with this, but you can be damn sure it has something to do with money...mainly making more of it.  Perhaps they see higher revenue potential in the blu ray market, so they're trying to steer the fans in that direction. Or perhaps they're simply cheap sons of you-know-whats and they've gotten so big that they simply don't give a you-know-what anymore about the paying customers who made them what they are.

Either way, any fan who buys this dvd will be sending the UFC a very clear message: ""You can serve me a human feces sandwich on a silver platter and I'll gladly eat it because the platter is so nice and shiny.""

What possible motivation would the UFC have to invest the resources necessary to put out a stellar product if the fan base makes it clear that they'll buy anything the company puts out, no matter how badly the quality has declined? It's the responsibility of each and every one of us to perform out civic duty as cogs in a capitalist system and reject the product when the product no longer meets the fundamental values of an honest and decent, god-fearing people.

This is our Alamo...the Battle of the Little Big Horn.

We stand at the Hot Gates on the shores of Thermopylae with an army of a million Zuffa shills bearing down upon us. And The world will know that free men stood against a tyrant, that few stood against many, and before this battle was over, even a fat, bald, foul-mouthed UFC president can bleed.

We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps it's fate that today is the release of the UFC: Best of 2013, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom... Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution... but from an over-saturated market filled with a diluted product that is slowly choking the life out of our beloved bloodsport. We are fighting for our right to live. To exist. And should we win the day, March 25th 2013 will no longer be known as the release date for the UFC: Best of 2013 dvd, but as the day that mma fans declared in one voice: ""We will not go quietly into the night!"" We will not vanish without a fight! We're going to live on! We're going to survive!

...Today we celebrate our Independence Day!!!!",1395705600,10,2493,4.509977827050998

REVIEW:
UFC Best of 2013 is the 7th installment of UFC's annual Best Of Series and the 6th installment to be released on blu-ray disc. The UFC's annual best of series chronicles the best fights and memorable moments of the year. The 2007 - 2010 editions showcased the best of their respective years by showing the best fights in their entirety in the main feature. Those editions also had ""bonus fights"" which showed full fights that were not in the main feature. Starting from the 2011 edition, UFC changed the format of the main feature from showing full fights to only showing clips of fights of the best or important fights of the year. The change in format displeased several fans as they would rather see full fights in the main feature. Fortunately, the 2011 edition and the succeeding 2012 edition had several full fights that are labeled as ""bonus fights"" with some of those fights already featured in highlight form in the main feature. This 2013 blu-ray edition is the same format as the 2011 and 2012 editions which means that the main feature is a highlight reel. Like the main features of the 2011 and 2012 edition, the main feature shows highlights of the best and important fights of 2013. Fortunately, this 2013 blu-ray edition also contains 25 full fights that are labeled as ""bonus fights.""

2013 was considered by many MMA fans as one of UFC's most memorable year. The 25 full fights on this blu-ray does a great job in chronicling the best fights and memorable moments of 2013. UFC's home video department did a better job in their selection of full fights for this blu-ray set than the 2012 blu-ray set. 2013 was the year where the women's bantamweight division introduced to the UFC. Three of the best fights from the women's bantamweight division are on this blu-ray in their entirety. This blu-ray set also contains several 2013 fight of the year candidates such as Jon Jones vs. Alexander Gustafsson, Gilbert Melendez vs. Diego Sanchez, Wanderlei Silva vs. Brian Stann, Georges St-Pierre vs. Johny Hendricks and Mark Hunt vs. Antonio Silva. There are also full fights with memorable knockouts such as Vitor Belfort's knockouts of Luke Rockhold & Dan Henderson, Travis Browne's knockouts of Alistair Overeem & Josh Barnett and Chris Weidman's knockout of Anderson Silva.

Obviously, when it comes to these types of compilations, there will always be criticisms of certain fights being omitted. Personally, I am happy with the selection of full fights. The only omissions of fights that I wished was available on this set is Jose Also vs. Frankie Edgar and Carlos Condit vs. Martin Kampmann.

Overall, I would recommend UFC Best of 2013 on Blu-ray. It's a great compilation of several great fights of 2013. I can't give this set a perfect score because of the way the main feature is formatted.

(Review Note: the DVD version of UFC Best of 2013 is only one disc. That disc only contains the main feature. There are no full fights on the DVD version of UFC Best of 2013.)",1395273600,36,5408,4.621227887617065

Instead, you will get things like a two-sentence summary of a match that basically just ruins the match if you haven't seen it yet, or skips over any big moments you might remember if you have already seen it. Not all matches are tossed aside like this, but enough were for me that I quickly stopped watching. I would honestly recommend just signing up for UFC Fight Pass and watching all of these matches in their full glory for a much lower price. Seriously...UFC Fight Pass is AMAZING.
