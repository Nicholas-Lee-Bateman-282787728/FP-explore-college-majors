6639256,2,B00NC9TTGC,"It seems there is a cursed mummy in Egypt, whose name can not be written or spoken except they say ""Neferu"" (Brandon deSpain) a lot. The cursed mummy is guarded or kept in check by a diamond called ""The Codex"". Carl (Danny Glover) is a rich collector and can count on only one man to get ""The Codex"" for him other than Harrison Ford or Nicolas Cage, and that is Jack Wells (William McNamara) a dubious archeologist who knows his stuff and will work for less than those other guys. God knows how much they had to spend for Danny Glover. Apparently Eric Roberts was busy the day they shot this film.  Anyway, Jack tags along with rival Dr. Jeremy Cooper (Eric Young) to find the tomb.

Now to turn this mediocre script into a bad film, they opted for Jack to wear a special set of glasses that can transmit everything Jack looks at directly to Carl, who can also speak to Jack via an earpiece. No one knows about this than Jack and we quickly find out he has eyes for the ladies (Andrea Monier). This is a pretty good sender/receiver because it can work underground deep in a cave. Where can I get a set of those? That would be great, we can all go on line and watch what everybody else is doing, like looking at what everybody else is doing...sort of like Facebook but you don't have to type.

Believe it or not, there are worse Mummy movies out there such as ""Isis Rising...""  and ""The Mummy Resurrected.""

6639258,3,B00NC9TTGC,Pretty boring in parts but did have a twist in the way it was filmed.  Not over the top super CGI or anything like that.

6639259,2,B00NC9TTGC,"They call this seeing the film first person, garbage it's still like watching another of those found footage crap being released so much in these B and Indie movies because it is cheaper to film.  I knew I was in trouble when William McNamara was listed in the opening credits as Billy McNamara.  The only time (until the closing scene) you see Danny Glover is on a computer screen or in a small corner of the screen as he gives instructions to McNamara through these remarkable glasses that he can see and you have to look through for 90% of the movie.  Incidentally these advance glasses allows them to talk back and forth even under ground in these ridiculous small tunnels which they also manage to navigate without getting lost.  One has to wonder how they managed to get this sarcophagus through.  A low grade B movie, poorly written and badly directed.  Great cover art though.  The mummy wasn't too bad looking but he didn't come out until the last 10% or less of the movie.  I think it was the style of the movie that really brought this movie down.",1418774400,,1058,4.50261780104712
6639260,1,B00NC9TTGC,Worst Movie Ever. Poorly directed. Trying to cash in on first person movies. No originality. I now question Danny Glover as a actor due to incredibly poor directing.,1418688000,,165,4.928571428571429
6639261,1,B00NC9TTGC,"You get me the stone and we wipe the slate clean. Archaeologist Jack Wells (McNamara) is in trouble and when he is given a chance to clear his debts by millionaire Carl (Glover) he takes it. He joins a group in Egypt on the quest to find the lost Codix Stone. What they find is something that no one could have imagined. Just in case you were wondering this has nothing to do with the Mummy series. Other than that this is pretty much just not good. I was actually looking forward to seeing the way this was filmed. It is filmed in a type of video game style. Jack puts on a pair of glasses with a camera in it and you see Carl in a corner telling him what do to. That idea sounded neat, it was done OK but even that gimmick couldn't save this movie. I don't really like saying too many bad things about a movie because I have never made one, but if someday I get that chance Im pretty sure it would be better than this. Overall, a neat filming idea and a awful, awful movie. I give it a D.",1418601600,,990,4.005050505050505
6639262,1,B00NC9TTGC,One of the worse mummy movies ever. Waste of a DVD,1418428800,5,50,3.6363636363636362
6639263,4,B00NC9TTGC,"I confess:  I didn't expect to like DAY OF THE MUMMY.  When I first got the press release, I was curious.  The plot was familiar, however Im a big fan of ancient Egyptian mythology, so I thought I would give it a shot.  But because of the images on the DVD cover and the actors involved with the film, I didn't have high expectations; I was anticipating a cheap knockoff of the Brendan Frasier MUMMY franchise.  Im happy to report my skepticism was unfounded, and DAY OF THE MUMMY is a fun horror flick that offers both chills and entertainment.  Sure, its low budget, but thats part of what makes it so much fun.

I mentioned the DVD cover above, and I have to clarify that its not actually horriblein fact, it looks rather decent.  I particularly like the Mummy and how evil it looks.  However, I cant tell you how many times Ive watched a movie based on its awesome cover, only to be disappointed with how crappy the film itself was.  Im glad thats not the case here.

DAY OF THE MUMMY is shot rather well, considering the method of camerawork chosen; 90 percent of the film is shot from a first-person view, while the remaining 10 percent is the traditional third-person angle.  Interestingly, this really works for the film, and it helps ramp up the intensity for certain scenes.

The acting is pretty good overall.  There are a couple of dry performances, but everybody else is good for the most part.  I am definitely interested to see Danny Glover in this film; he plays a prick, but he seems well-suited for the role (I don't mean that in a negative way, either).

The special effects are not too shabby, eitheralthough a couple of aspects could have been better.  I like the Mummy design and the realism of its facial features.  My complaint about the effects, though, is in regard to the hieroglyphs and stone tablets.  They look WAY too new and modern.  I also don't like how the tablets are just leaning up against the cave walls, all nice and proper.  This really detracts from the realism of the movie for me.

But thats about the only complaint I have with DAY OF THE MUMMY.  This low budget gem is a winner for me, and I recommend giving it a chance.  Just disregard the graphics on the back of the DVD coverthey have NOTHING to do with the film and are meant solely to pique your interest.  DAY OF THE MUMMY releases next week, so make a note.",1417651200,12,2361,4.422273781902552

6639271,2,B00NC9TTGC,"Who doesn't want to hear action film legend Danny Glover deliver that DeNiro line from TAXI DRIVER ""You talkin' to me?""

That's the only joy in this embarrassingly bad low-budget 18th iteration of THE MUMMY. OK, and there was one kick-ass vintage carpet in the hotel room at the doorway. But even the opening sex scene was badly written, and if you think of all the mainstream movie sex scenes you've watched, you realize it's not easy to ruin something that straightforward.

Cinematography was OK, script terrible. Mostly bad acting, especially by the lead in Indiana Jones clothes. Even a not-so-great story about yet another cursed Egyptian noble would have been slightly more interesting if it weren't centered on a big ass modern style, precision cut, thousand-facet Tiffany style diamond totally absent from the famous jewelry store chains of Ancient Egypt.

Too bad: like tens of millions of people around the globe, over the decades I've enjoyed many Danny Glover action movies, and know from his philanthropy and activism he's also pretty great human. In the indie, low-budget film biz, stars get paid to star, but not to write or direct. So this is not a travesty that can be blamed on Mr. Glover.

And what was with all the actors' voices so chirpy? Just don't spend the time thinking about all this like I did because I  actually watched 30 minutes  and then put in even more time trying to figure why badness reigned on every front. Wherever the true origins of its multiple badnesses lie, you shouldn't waste another nano-second thinking about DAY OF THE MUMMY.",1427846400,4,1576,4.861940298507463

6639279,1,B00NC9TTGC,"This was a horrible movie unless you like low budget, badly acted movies. Then its for you. This is one of those movies that tries to emulate the Cloverfield first person/movie camera point of view. Sadly, they didn't have the budget to make it work. Danny Glover's picture pops up every now and then to talk to the main character but does nothing else. The main actor does a horrible job. My 3 year-old son can emote better than this guy. As some else says, there is only one mummy in the whole movie and you don't see it until the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. And the make up/costume effect is about on par with store bought  Halloween costume. I wasn't expecting much from a $10 movie, but even with this, I want my money back. Do yourself a favor.

6639282,1,B00NC9TTGC,"Worst mummy movie I have ever seen!!! Almost the entire film is shot in a video game style, where you see through the eyes of one character wearing a pair of glasses, conveniently with a camera inside, which transmits everything the character sees to the wanna be god rich man played by Danny Glover. The whole movie you see him pop up on the screen in the bottom left corner screaming and whining about the codex stone, while all kinds of chaos is going on around the characters, and they are trying to save their own lives. But, that doesn't faze rich man wanna be god in the least... all he cares about is the stupid stone. Then in the last 10 minutes of the movie, the mummy finally shows himself. Really? I thought this was a mummy movie... so why was there no mummy for almost the entire movie? And why did I feel like I was playing a video game instead of watching a movie? A really badly written, and even worse directed movie? Save yourself the bother of the horrible movie and watch something worth it.",1419638400,4,1012,4.35978835978836
6639283,1,B00NC9TTGC,"Picked this one up cheap at a local store. I paid too much. First of all this is the hand-held camera view with a couple of twists: 1. The camera is in the heroes glasses; 2. Danny Glover pops in now and then remotely to talk to the hero reminding him to keep his eyes off breasts and to keep them on the goal--a ridiculously large diamond with magic powers. Basically, an Egyptologist and his team vanishes in the desert. His camera is found, so, a very wealthy American (Danny Glover) puts together a second team to go find him and, hopefully, a magical diamond. The hero isn't much of one. A very dumbed down Indiana Jones minus the whip. His sex appeal escapes me. The token lady is supposed to be a security expert but spends much of her time getting lost or being rescued by the hero; otherwise her job is to give the hero cleavage shots, to sleep with him and later on, despite being treated low, walk off with him into the sunset. The cover implied that there would be an army of mummies but it turns out there was just one. There isn't much of  the mummy until the end and that is rather ho-hum. I knew this film was going to crash fast at the beginning. When the Egyptologist referred to the age of Pharaohs as being around 2000 years ago, well, be warned.",1419638400,2,1266,4.275

8677338,1,B00NC9TTGC,Why an actor of Danny Glover's level does films like this is hard to understand. He appears to have no respect for the craft and would rather whore his name for a pay day.

I think my friends and I made.a better movie (with better special effects too!) when we were in 6th grade....and Im in my 40s now!

And Danny Glover must be having a hard time in his post-Lethal Weapon days....I mean what was he thinking?  His part is completely ridiculous, and the contrived use of some sort of communication glasses to keep him involved in the story is another major stink bomb in this movie.
