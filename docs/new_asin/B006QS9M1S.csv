5013552,4,B006QS9M1S,"I bought this because one of my favorite movies is Pocket Full of Miracles which was a remake of this movie and the reviews I read about this movie claimed that it was far superior to Pocketful of Miracles. It was good, but I prefer Pocketful of Miracles.",1355443200,3,255,4.333333333333333
5013553,5,B006QS9M1S,May Robson is one actress that has a lot of talent in her day. May has brought the meaning of acting to the silver screen.,1354579200,,122,3.92
5013554,5,B006QS9M1S,"This re-issue and re-mastering of the Capra Classic, is by far the Best version now available!  I know the Studio & Distributor, and extra care was taken in renovating this from the original master 35mm film!  This is probably the BEST of Frank Capra's under-rated classics, and ranks right up there with It Happened One Night & You Can't Take It With You. At the retail price, this is a genuine bargain, and the extra footage which was incorporated helps make this new product THE BEST overall Capra movie available!",1328659200,12,517,4.733333333333333
5013555,1,B006QS9M1S,"i watched this movie on tv and promptly ordered it from Amazon. the dialogues are fabulous and not a word to be missed.
Unfortunately I am hard of hearing and need close captions, your copy does not have  close caption and I cannot watch it.
 Is there any chance you can obtain one for me with closed caption. ????

I would really appreciate your efforts.

5013557,5,B006QS9M1S,"If you love old movies this is one to have in your library. Amazing story, costumes for the era, funny and endearing! They don't make them like this anymore!",1401148800,,157,4.448275862068965
5013558,5,B006QS9M1S,"This was an early effort by Frank Capra. He would later go on to make such films as ""It Happened One Night"", ""The Bitter Tea of General Yen"", ""You Can't Take it with You"", ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", ""Meet John Doe"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and many others. ""Lady for a Day"" is a true film classic. Although Capra would later do a remake of the film under the title of ""Pocket Full of Miracles"", staring Bette Davis and Glen Ford, his original ""Lady for a Day"" is still the best. It's a lovely film that tugs at the heart strings without getting sappy...well...maybe a little sappy, but it's a wonderful film from three time Academy Award winner Frank Capra.",1392768000,2,663,4.487603305785124
5013559,5,B006QS9M1S,I'd seen this movie on TCM and loved it.  I awakened one morning and my husband had it playing and I fell in love with it and just had to have it.  It's a tear jerker but I well worth it.,1390262400,,187,3.5365853658536586
5013560,5,B006QS9M1S,"Great film and great performances by all.  Much superior to Pocketful of Miracles, which was also a very good film, because this version was more believable among other reasons.",1389484800,,177,5.103448275862069

5013562,5,B006QS9M1S,"this is so much more realistic than a Cinderella story but I think you would have to be  old enough to understand what the great depression was about and hardship . whenever I need to be lifted up I watch this movie it just makes you feel good and happy and those  mugs are so  dave the dude, judge and happy the whole gang hilarious, and of course the real love they all have for annie, very touching story,  entertaining throughout.",1377734400,2,434,4.320987654320987
5013563,5,B006QS9M1S,"This story is perhaps better known in its later version, ""A Pocketful of Miracles"" with Bette Davis. Many prefer this version made in 1933 with May Robson as Apple Annie, a crafty character with a love for gin and a secret daughter living abroad who thinks her mother is a wealthy society lady. All the delightful Damon Runyon characters who later appeared in ""Guys and Dolls"" are here with their mangled English and rough manners. Watching them try to clean up their act to help their friend Annie to impress her prospective European in-laws is always fun. Can they possibly bring it off? Will the young lovers find happiness? Is there anybody out there who doesn't know how this story ends?",1370563200,,692,4.7272727272727275

8503161,5,B006QS9M1S,"Mae Robson, having been in the silent films, brings an amazing performance from angst to composed self-assurance and, finally, contentment with the knowledge that her daughter will, indeed, have a happy marriage without knowing of her mother's heart-breaking background.",1504915200,,270,5.948717948717949
