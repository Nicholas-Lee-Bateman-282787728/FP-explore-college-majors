This film does not fit the mold of other movies...it is sweet, touching, funny, filmed beautifully, and has a killer soundtrack! As I watched this film, I felt like I was reading a good book and just did not want it to end! If Land Ho! never made it to your area during its' theatrical release, do yourself a favor and buy the blu ray/DVD TODAY! You can thank me later!!!",1414972800,10,440,4.313253012048193

6647883,4,B00NF6P85S,Bit of a slice of life kind of movie so neat tied up endings are not on the menu here.

6647885,1,B00NF6P85S,"I watched this movie - or tried to - on a trip to Iceland, thinking I'd appreciate the scenery and people shown along the way. I was forgiving the plodding depiction of one man trying to cheer up his depressed friend, hoping it would get going eventually. But the unending dialogue of sexual references and jokes finally made me turn it midway through. The dialogue resembles a couple of teenagers yammering on constantly about women from a sexploits perspective. It would have been poorly done had the two main characters been 17, but they are in their 70's - just so cringe provoking.

Sorry - Iceland is a lovely country with intriguing people and progressive culture. There was so much more this movie could have made of all that.",1470960000,,734,4.689922480620155

6647921,5,B00NF6P85S,"To be honest I didn't enjoy Land Ho! as much as most people did, but I feel like I have to give it 5 stars anyway simply because I strongly think the reason I didn't enjoy it is because I'm not old enough to appreciate the elderly man humor occurring here.

The film's basically about two older men (Earl Lynn Nelson and Paul Eenhoorn) who've retired and take a trip to Iceland.  They say whatever they want, but they're never obnoxious.  One of them in particular is very talkative while the friend usually just wants to be left alone.  I like when the one man would constantly talk to younger people and provide advice, and the scene where he continues to get on the nerves of a recently married couple is the best part of the whole movie I think.  He even says they should have breakfast.  I bet I know what the married couple was thinking but didn't say, lol.

I also like the parts where the men invite two younger women over and they strike up a looooong conversation.  Too me this scene looked like it was about to go in a *very* different inappropriate/dirty direction but thankfully it never did.  Luckily these two men play nice and compliment the young ladies, and even encourage them to go out shopping to buy things for themselves with the one man willing to give the ladies his credit card.  They strike up a longer conversation at the restaurant while having dinner.

Otherwise these men go for long walks in the dark in the fields of Iceland, meet more people, wonder if it's safe to drive across a river at one point, bring up old times, and just drive around having fun in the country parts of Iceland.  Could've been funnier but again, I'm probably too young to understand it.  Worth watching- just expect a slower moving storyline than what we're accustomed to seeing in comedies nowadays.",1439251200,,1809,4.512269938650307

6647927,5,B00NF6P85S,"This is a movie I didn't exactly know what to think about when I finished watching it in the theater. I was very excited before hand, but I guess it didn't go the way I thought it would, which is OK! There isn't much conflict here, but just by spending the time with Mitch and Colin, you get little bits here and there about their lives and personalities that really shine. These two certainly embody the buddies of a buddy comedy, they're just a little older than the ones you've seen before...Now, let's not forget Iceland. The cinematography in this film perfectly captures the most beautiful locations around Iceland. It is breathtaking. And the cold color palette of grays and blues adds its own beauty. I highly recommend this film. It truly is one of the great indies to come out in recent years.",1430956800,,803,4.583333333333333

6647929,5,B00NF6P85S,"My Favorite Movie EVER!!!  Having seen this movie on the same day that my supervisor was fired I  found this movie to be my healing source.  This is a movie that can be watched and re-watched over and over as if you are a young child.  It is a touching and healing story that makes a person (probably more male than female) feel good about life.  The movie about two rather mature men is a rare find in that it is not overly silly or grumpy. Instead it is about two men ""getting their groove back"" and getting on with their lives.  It is an amazing movie and I can't wait to watch it again!!  The movie soundtrack is excellent and the scenery is chilling!  See it and you will gradually be changed forever!!",1430438400,,707,4.223880597014926
6647930,3,B00NF6P85S,"Mitch (Earl Lynn Nelson) and Colin (Paul Eenhoorn) are former brothers-in-law (each previously married to sisters) who reconnect at Mitch's insistence.  They are both closing in on 70 and retired.  Mitch, was a surgeon and Colin a French horn player and bank branch manager.  Mitch has surprised Colin with first class tickets to Iceland.  Colin, not one to do things on a whim, reluctantly agrees.  There really is no story here.  It is almost documentary-like as the adventures of the pair are followed by the camera.  I'm guessing audiences will identify with one of the two characters.  Mitch is a bit of a blowhard from New Orleans, outgoing and fun-loving.  Colin is a quiet, unassuming Aussie.  They couldn't be more different.  And of course, that is where the humor comes from.

Mitch is footing the bill and has everything planned out including the rental car, a huge Hummer which they use to traipse all over the island nation.  The photography is beautiful, from the frozen mountains and icecaps to the barren landscape to the vibrant city life of Reykjavik.  The problem with the film is that there never seems to be a purpose.  There are no big announcements or surprises.  Well, other than Mitch's grad-student female cousin (once removed) and her lady-friend showing up for a night.  I wasn't quite sure where this arrangement was heading, and was squirming as much as Colin was.  Fortunately, they just went out on the town and had a good time.

Mitch and Colin get into it a couple times, essentially due to Mitch's arrogance and boorish behavior.  For example, he chastises Colin for wearing jeans and a sweater to dinner at the hotel, suggesting he should dress up more.  Toward the end of the film, the ""boys"" meet a 40-something, coincidently a bank branch manager, from Canada at some remote hot springs.  She and Colin hit it off and perhaps more, but the filmmakers just leave us in a lurch as to where that might head.  It was the only meaningful point of the movie.  The rest is just a journey of a pair of old farts, amusingly I admit, trying to extend the reason for life.  Just exploring.

The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The video presentation is very good if not perfect.  In a couple instances, the scenes seemed a bit blurry, but for the most part the detail is excellent.  There isn't a lot of color in the film as you might expect.  The sky is usually a hazy grey and the brown rolling hills suggest more Earth tones.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 lossless sound track is excellent.  Clear and easily understood dialog is conveyed throughout the film.  There is an excellent musical score and a scene at a nightclub that really gets the speakers jumping.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Extras include a commentary track with the actors and directors/writers Martha Stephens and Aaron Katz, a Q & A with the same people, a couple deleted scenes, a trailer and some previews from Sony.",1429660800,2,2996,4.718146718146718
6647931,5,B00NF6P85S,"Are you ready to go on a journey while taking it all in very downtempo? Well, this little film starts out with two (because of the passing away of their wives) brothers-in-law who are still great friends and this is what it is all about, nuanced leads, good dialog, and a character-driven experience. If you are not interested in a story developing gradually then this may not be a movie for you. If an unhurried and easy pace will work for you, try ""Land Ho!"".  When Colin (Paul Eenhoorn) comes to visit his outgoing friend-of-a lifetime who is a surgeon, Mitch (Earl Lynn Nelson), a discussion starts about their wives that are now gone and a sort of dismal cover begins to drape their conversation. Mitch is not one to ever wallow in self-pity while always being extroverted and straight away begins to lift up his introverted buddy Colin with tickets to explore an expansive Iceland together. It takes a little coaxing as Colin is a more serious type while Mitch is the bawdy type that wants to have an adventure. He feels this is the best time of all to have this trip with his buddy who appears a little depressed with life. Colin does go along with the idea as the tickets are already purchased and Mitch would never take ""No"" for an answer anyway. Colin really never stood a chance with Mitch's insistence but why not?

I thought these two men on a trip to mainly Reykjavik, Iceland was a treat as it isn't common to see the points of view of two men sharing a long term friendship. Theirs is as unique as any other and perhaps for me, even more enjoyable. I liked the lighter storyline and a theme that is grounded in conversation and personalities. These two certainly present two different personality types, this must be why they have gotten along so well over the years even after the passing of their spouses. I definitely appreciated the approach to women that they come across in life and found it interesting how all women were beautiful to them including their ratings of Hollywood starlets. I could relish the manner of how they spoke about them - comically at times but respectful at the same time. I was also pleased with viewing how much fun they had in their rented 'Range Rover' to go through creeks and small ponds and the not so easy landscape. They got to the point of having more and more fun with their map guide to Iceland. Seeing a geyser go off was particularly fun as I did not know too much, including how completely gorgeous the amazing vistas exclusive to Iceland really are but for my Scandinavian roots. This according to the Sagas of Leif ""The Lucky"" Eriksson who was banished to Iceland by his father, Erik ""The Red"" Thorvaldsson of whom I have only read a portion of their Folklore.

This movie moves at a noticeable leisurely pace which didn't bore me. Actually, I prefer it when stories are uncomplicated at times and people's ideas, personalities, and idiosyncrasies are given the time to be displayed; no matter how long the character development or what the film is expressing. Here, from co-writers/co-directors Aaron Katz and Martha Stephens, I found an astounding Iceland (Andrew Reed) just showing off her lovely' terrain as if it was completely alive through the lead characters. The campsites, the trendy nightspots, even the outdoor pools to soak in the water were all interesting to see as these two men explore what their lives have to offer themselves and to the world, still. At the different sites in Iceland, the soundtrack (Keegan DeWitt), was astounding with the bombast of ""In a Big Country"" several times which is a perfect background song for these two sojourners and at times moving in slow motion. These two suck up the glances from over the shoulders of girls in the swimming pool in that slow motion strut to (once again) 'In a Big Country'. They truck on by with towels around their necks and slick admiration right back at them. This is not only a buddy trip but a relevant look at aging, loneliness, friendships and the need for togetherness along with having fun at any age.",1427760000,5,4046,4.648044692737431

6647963,2,B00NF6P85S,"I was first attracted to this film because of the location: Iceland. However this was probably the worst acting I have seen since the old ""Billy Jack"" movies. Earl Lynn Nelson reminded me of the type of person you dread sitting next to on an airplane; loud and obnoxious. There is a scene where he encounters a couple on their honeymoon and he begins to give fatherly advice while making comments about how young  they both look and how attractive the wife is....I would have walked away from this boor in a second. Then he and his ex-brother-in-law heat to the airport to pick up his young female cousin and her friend while he rambles on about how ""hot"" they both were. Not only were they not that attractive (not really the point)  but they looked to be about 12. I think in the hands of a Bruce Dern or someone similar, this could have been a much better movie. The filming was pretty good and I enjoyed the scenery but the lack of any real point of view combined with the acting made this a laborious one time view.",1422057600,,1020,4.363157894736842

It felt like I and the supporting cast were held hostage by the lecherous lead curmudgeon who used his wealth to ingratiate his way into peoples lives.  His repulsive humor only made you wince and hold your breath until the moment passed.  If my dog had not been sleeping on the remote control I would have turned this movie off much earlier.  That said, I only made it about 15mins. which was about the time the lead character began making extremely inappropriate incestuous remarks to his very young cousin. It pains me to think that screenwriters/producers would attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator. This could have been an inspired film with good pace had the writing not been dumb down and misogynistic. There is a difference between sexy and sexually abusive.  This was the latter. The dialogue was revolting to the point of distraction. For entertainment purposes, why would anyone recreate such an annoying slimy character that one would avoid in real life. Comedy can include a touch of well placed blue humor, but it doesn't have to be turgid and disgusting to make it work.",1421193600,3,1193,4.8861386138613865
6647967,5,B00NF6P85S,"If you like your movies where something big or meaningful has to happen, else you think ""it's boring,"" ""it's dull"" and ""nothing happened, so we walked out,"" then steer clear of ""Land Ho"" as it won't be your cup of tea. But if, like me, you appreciate small, quirky films that resemble real life inhibited by characters you could surely meet in daily passing, then this winning little film is just the ticket for you.  A few months after seeing it, I find myself thinking about it quite a bit and end up smiling thinking of the sweetest parts of it.

I joked recently that the film's credits include the line ""Filmed on location in Kentucky and Iceland"" and that was the only time in recorded history that that sentence had been assembled.  It speaks to the inventiveness of the script devised by co-writers/co-directors Aaron Katz and Martha Stephens.  Retirees and former brothers-in-law (and still friends) Mitch (Earl Lynn Nelson) and Colin (Paul Eenhoorn) meet up in the former's Kentucky residence.  Mitch springs a surprise on down-in-the-dumps Colin, proposing a trip to Iceland to push him out of his rut.

From there, 'Land Ho' follows these two around Iceland in their rented Range Rover.  Indeed, nothing much happens...but that's entirely the point. It's two guys of a certain age bonding and living their lives.  The third co-star at this point is Iceland, its vistas and stunning backdrops captured in vibrant color by cinematographer, Andrew Reed.  A natural reaction to this film should be to put Iceland on your travel agenda.

Nelson and Eenhoorn are fabulous here.  Nelson is a doctor-turned-actor.  His lack of formal training in the arts is clear here. That's part of the charm.  He makes up for it with his boisterous, larger-than-life personality.  I have to believe that the Earl Lynn Nelson we see here is exactly what you get in real life.  Who wouldn't want to be friends with this guy?

The acting chops come from Eenhoorn playing the reserved, taciturn Colin.  Of course, part of that taciturn nature is imposed upon him by Nelson's Mitch, whose boisterous love of life is manifested by a running commentary on just about everything that crosses his path or mind.  However, the movie succeeds on the strength of Eenhoorn's gentle change and his ability to express intimacy after the pain of a recent split.  It's credit to Eenhoorn's considerable skill as a actor.

I can't talk about this film without noting the Katz & Stephens' brilliant use of Big Country's ""In a Big Country"" to drive home two key parts of the narrative.  First is to back a montage depicting highlights of the guys' trip, most notably a scene on a beach with dark sands.  I later read an interview in which the stars said they showed up to film at that beach and encountered brutal winds that whipped sand into their faces. The planned scene was impossible.  However, the footage Katz and Stephens collected of the stars laughingly leaning into the elements is a perfect complement to the jolt of energy that ""In a Big Country"" delivers.

Then, in a Sgt. Pepper's-like reprise, the song appears again right at film's end as Colin and Mitch, resplendent in a spa's white robes, make their way around a pool edge - the stars, captured in slow motion by Reed's camera, their white robes offset against the scene's vibrant blues, the attention paid to them by the young girls in the water as they pass, ""In a Big Country"" building to its exuberant fullness of noise...well, that's just a great piece of moviemaking.  I defy you not to be smiling when the credits roll.",1420243200,8,3566,4.778140293637847

6647990,5,B00NF6P85S,"Two lovable geezers take an improbable road trip, with an unstated agenda of finding hope without illusion. They succeed, and the film succeeds by not burdening their quest with too many distractions or demeaning it with facile answers. Although their characters are quite different, they both possess qualities with which we will identify. Most viewers (like me) will begin this journey wondering, ""Why?"" and emerge at the end with an assured air of ""Why not?""",1415491200,6,461,5.16
6647991,1,B00NF6P85S,"Thought the other low reviews might be due to the reviewers being too young to appreciate this type of movie.  I'm a member of the ""older generation"" and I'm telling you the best part of the movie was the trailer.  From there it went downhill fast.  Waste of time and money.  In one word - boring!",1415404800,2,297,4.25
6647992,5,B00NF6P85S,"Saw this film at the theaters and was charmed by its simplicity, imagery, and message. It makes you appreciate and reflect on what your life has given you, and there is an opportunity to see what lies ahead. In simple, it's honest because it makes you think, without much of the unnecessary prattle you get from similar films. Here there are two friends, with close ties through family who take a trip through a very exotic location, and it shows what type of people they are. They are as ordinary as you and me, and yet they discover their special bond while exploring one of the most special places on Earth. It's an adventure that will appeal to all who see it. Give it chance.",1415318400,9,680,4.448

8677681,4,B00NF6P85S,"If you want to see the beauty of Iceland, fast-forward 44 minutes into the film.  The story picks up speed at that point.

Mitch and Collin are former brothers-in-law.  Collin just lost his wife and is depressed.  Mitch, the still-practicing doctor, wants to cheer him up by taking him on a trip to Iceland, where together they drive the Golden Circle and see spectacular waterfalls, deep ravines, geysers and soak in some hot springs.

I almost turned this film off in the beginning because of Mitch's crassness.  But he turns out to be a crass guy with heart.  There's a lot of talking and talking in the first 43 minutes (some of it mundane) but once the two men get out of Reykjavik and drive the Golden Circle, the beauty of Iceland unfolds.",1512172800,,746,4.56390977443609
8677682,3,B00NF6P85S,"This isn't a bad little film. Basically, two guys take a trip around Iceland and talk... a lot. The dialog is realistic, and the acting is fine, for what it is. But there isn't much happening. Mitch is a pig and kind of annoying, but his heart is in the right place; Colin is kind of depressed, but otherwise a decent guy. Ultimately, they both find a little resolution to their issues, but it's all very understated. I found the film dull in places, and actually turned it off about 2/3rds in. Then I went back the next night and finished it. I'm glad I did, because I enjoyed the ending. But it didn't blow me away.",1502582400,,617,4.282051282051282
