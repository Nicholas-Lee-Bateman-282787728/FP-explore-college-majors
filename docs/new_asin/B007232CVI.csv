8508707,3,B007232CVI,It is great that Rod Cameron westerns eventually are released. This one here is not one of the best though. It is a bit boring with too little action and Cameron himself seems a little bored. The credits go to John Ireland who is good as the on and of good and bad guy. The picture quality is not totally sharp but acceptable. I think I would have expected better from an MGM release.,1359331200,4,384,4.202702702702703
8508708,5,B007232CVI,"Rod Cameron always seemed to play second-fiddle to more significant Western actors like Randy Scott, Audie Murphy and Joel McCrea. Yet he starred in several entertaining films, some of which have recently been released from the vaults (cf. the Monogram Cowboys, vols. I and 2). SOUTHWEST PASSAGE is solid entertainment, with good photography and action, a fine supporting cast, and well worth viewing. Cameron made films for a number of companies. Several he did with Republic were once available on VHS--let's hope that some of them (e.g., BRIMSTONE, RIDE THE MAN DOWN, OH SUSANNA, SAN ANTONE, etc.) will be released soon on DVD. In the meantime, enjoy SOUTHWEST PASSAGE.",1337990400,7,672,5.174311926605505
