8461644,5,B0058JTUWC,"The set is pretty nice, as far as the actual show goes it is very very random and very funny in my opinion. Definitely something to check out.",1369180800,,142,4.107142857142857
8461645,4,B0058JTUWC,"The item itself is amazing but for the price, it doesn't really come with much. Arakawa is one of my favorites but if it wasn't in my top 10-ish, I wouldn't have ever looked into purchasing this with such a high price.",1354838400,,218,4.214285714285714
8461646,5,B0058JTUWC,"I assume that if you're reading this you're well aware of the randomness and strange gags of the crew under the Arakawa.

Unlike other so called 'special editions', this one is actually worth the money. The box is large and striking and it comes with a proper book filled with illustrations and useful information (all in english). The BD is a good transfer too.",1350345600,,362,4.65625
8461647,5,B0058JTUWC,"First,to be clear, I love this anime. It's cute and hilarious but still manages to get under your skin, just as the riverbed-dwellers get under Recruit's skin and why he will try his hardest to protect his new home from any threat, even if it means facing down his overbearing father for the first time in his life.

All of the characters on this show are awesome. you are never left with a dull moment when anyone is on the screen. from the kappa(?) village chief to the militant ""Sister""(actually a male former mercenary)everyone impresses heavily upon the viewer from their introductory scene and the straight man ""Recruit"" will not stop telling you just how wrong it all is. The VA for ""Recruit"" Kou Ichinomoya is the same guy who played the teacher on ""Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei""(another of Studio SHAFT's productions), so he has plenty of experience yelling at crazy people and sounding great while doing it. Funny thing is, he may be just as crazy as they are!

The show is subbed only, so if you just HAVE to hear the English, don't get it. The dvd+bluray package does include a commentary track by the cast and crew for every episode, something which NEVER happens with anime dvd collections and offers entertaining insight into the show.

The Episodes are split into short chapters which make for fast-paced viewing, but most times the plot remains consistent throughout the episode itself. They still come packaged in 20-minute chunks with great opening and Ending OPs that will be buzzing in your ears for days even if you can't understand Japanese.

What starts as just an experiment in the bizarre becomes a genuinely heartfelt story about a community of people who ostracize themselves from society not because they could not live there if they wished, but for the inner peace offered by the loving community under the bridge. There's even a love story thrown in there too!",1342051200,5,1887,4.814814814814815
8461648,5,B0058JTUWC,if you're looking to buy this then i'm going to assume that you know what the show is about. It came with all 13 episodes and the book and box. It arrived on time and in good condition.,1333497600,2,185,3.8947368421052633
