4310638,5,B004AP3PO4,"Actual black and white broadcast of one of the best games in world series history. Nice to see a different perspective of Maz's dramatic game/series winning homerun. All the shots that we have seen have been from above the action but this shows the homerun from the center field camera. Game was originally broadcast by NBC in color, however, no known copies exist but this is still a gem. Announcers are Yankee great Mel allen and renowned Pirate announcer Bob Prince.  Game has an option to listen to action with actual TV or radio broadcast.  Plus it comes with interviews of some of the players and the 1960 Pirate highlight film. This is a must have for any true fan of baseball history.",1295222400,13,692,4.617886178861789
4310639,2,B004AP3PO4,"Condensed, I wanted the complete game with old commercials.

Mel Allen. It went straight to the first batter.",1295222400,9,163,4.857142857142857
4310640,5,B004AP3PO4,"If you're reading this there's a good chance you already know that the 1960 World Series ended abruptly with one of the two most dramatic home runs in baseball history (Bobby Thomson's 1951 N.L. Pennant-winning ""Shot Heard `Round the World"" being the other). Thought to be lost--or nonexistent in the first place--a kinescope of the historic and deciding seventh game was discovered several months ago in the basement of one of the Pittsburgh Pirates' former owners, the late entertainer Bing Crosby, by the Crosby family's archivist, Robert Bader. Unlike another historic recent discovery, Don Larsen's perfect pitching performance in game 5 of the '56 Series, the complete ""Mazeroski game"" was found in its entirety. The family made the kinescope available to MLB, and it is now, in the 50th anniversary year of the 1960 Series, available on DVD.

The long-available highlight film (included as an extra) naturally fell short in capturing the excitement and drama of this epic Game 7 clash between the underdog Pirates and the overpowering Yankees, who were arguably at the peak of their long and storied dynasty. In fact, the Bombers outscored the Pirates 55-27 in the Series, and Game 7 was a high scoring back-and-forth battle royal that alternately seemed hopeless for both teams at various points, something which has become overshadowed by Mazeroski's home run. The formidable outfield arms of Roberto Clemente and Roger Maris figured prominently in this game, as did the baserunning agility of Mickey Mantle, Casey Stengel's predilection for changing pitchers, and a less than perfectly manicured Forbes infield, which famously victimized Yankees shortstop Tony Kubek.

It's all here in this momentous 2-DVD package, as well as several extras, including interviews with Pirates Vern Law, Bill Mazeroski and Hal Smith (who in the 8th inning hit what might have been the game winning home run, had it not been for a Yankees rally in the top of the 9th), and Yankees Yogi Berra, Ralph Terry and Bobby Richardson (the WS MVP, and the only player to win that honor playing for the loser). Included as well are newsreels and highlights of the Pirates' 1960 season, a campaign that was punctuated with multiple comebacks emblematic of their World Series performance of that year.

The quality of the kinescope itself is typical of the era--decent, but not exactly the HD level we've become used to in this day and age. But for any baseball fan, the historical value alone makes this set a must-have.",1292457600,61,2501,5.08029197080292
4310641,5,B004AP3PO4,"When you ask sportcasters about the most iconic, the most spectacular plays in baseball, at least two if not three innings of this game are mentioned on the list. Much more than the ninth inning homer by Mazeroski that wins the game (the iconic baseball win in so many movies -- the final inning home run). That home run traveled 410 feet. This is not the only iconic moment. Don't evet think that hte Yankees put on a bad show. Here are brilliant plays by the Yankees (at that time kings of all sports dynasties. Most people thought them unstoppable and incapable of losing) and the Pirates in the innings leading up to the ninth.

This series had SEVEN baseball Most Valuable Players -- Dick Groat, Roberto Clemente, Yoggi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Elston Howard and Bobby Shantz. Casey Stengel managed his last World Series at 70 y/o.

This was one of those sports moments in sports -- a winning home run in the last inning of the last game - one pitch for all the marbles, one hit for the title. This game should have been saved and today would be recorded routinely but back then, it was thought lost.

I'm old (not really that old) but old enough to remember the day and there was no televised game. It was radio or nothing. no home team ever had TV of the game. I remember that evening going to the home of Elroy Face and congratulating him and my Mother getting his autograph. This is baseball the way it should be played.",1292371200,16,1439,4.443181818181818

Lead changes, great pitching and defense, a few bad hops and mental mistakes, and then in the bottom of the ninth...?  Well, I'll leave it right there.  If you ever wished you could be there, now you can.  My only regret is that I did not see this game sooner.

There are two soundtracks - one for TV and one from the radio.  I listened to Mel Allen and Bob Prince do the TV broadcast.  The genuine elation in the postgame interviews alone is worth the price.",1458000000,,573,4.192660550458716

4310662,5,B004AP3PO4,"I grew up a Pirates fan because that was the name of my first Little league team, which won our championship four years after this. I adore original broadcasts of old sporting events: they send you back in time the way a documentary cannot.

In baseball lore, the most famous home run is Bobby Thompson's which won the pennant but not the World Series. The most famous World Series home is Carlton Fisk's, which came in the sixth game of a seven game series which his team lost. That was also the greatest World Series game ever and the greatest baseball game ever. the 1969 Mets, who beat the awesome Baltimore Orioles, where the greatest Cinderella story ever.

The Pirates of the 50's were what the Mets were to the 60's. The 1952 Pirates were as bad as the 1962 Mets. The Pirates, like the Mets, built up young talent through the course of the decade and it suddenly blossomed into a pennant winner in 1960. They took on the even more awesome New York Yankees, absorbing beatings of 16-3, 10-0 and 12-0 to come back and win three close games of their own, setting up this dramatic finale in which they grabbed a 4-0 lead, watched the Yankees score 7 unanswered runs, responded with a 5 run 8th inning to take a 9-7 lead, lost that lead on a bang-bang play in the top of the 9th and then won it all on Maz's homer to lead off the 9th. it was their first World Series win in 35 years, (the Mets had only been in existence for 8 years when they won theirs). I submit that this is the greatest Cinderella story, the greatest game and the most dramatic home run in baseball history.

And here you can see it all take place before your eyes, just as it would have been seen back than. To a baseball fan and a Pirates fan, it's priceless, even if it is only a black and white kinoscope. (One caveat: I did not get a two disc set which offered the color highlight film, the radio broadcast, etc. They may be out of those. I got one disc with the kinoscope, the TV commentary and Bob Prince's post game interviews. But I'm still delighted to have it.)",1369785600,2,2046,4.295336787564767
4310663,5,B004AP3PO4,"This is a must have for any baseball fan.  This was considered the holy grail of baseball games that were lost, and now that it was found, it's amazing to watch the game, its ebbs and flows, and to observe the rhythm of the game as it once was.",1368748800,,244,3.979591836734694
4310664,5,B004AP3PO4,"Being from Pittsburgh, this video brought back many memories. Maz was my father's favorite ball player. I liked him too. My two sons and I watched the video together. It was a fun night. It's a good video to keep on the shelf.",1366070400,,226,4.27906976744186

4310666,5,B004AP3PO4,"This is a treasure.  It would have been nice to have included the commercials but it is still a wonderful piece of baseball.  I have been a Pirates' fan all my life.  When I was a kid I can remember Pie Traynor pitching plumbing ads on TV, the interviews Bob Prince did with Roberto Clemente - he always called him ""Bobby"", and Willie Stargell's ""chicken on the Hill"".  And though I was too young to remember Maz's home run, it goes right in there with Franco's Immaculate Reception.  Now I can see what I was too young to ever remember.  And for that alone, this DVD is worth the few dollars at a time when baseball was king.",1358208000,,626,4.262711864406779
4310667,5,B004AP3PO4,Love it... I guess because you really don't see the Pirates win my anymore. Having lived in the Burgh for sometime It's a legend you can't miss.  First major league game I ever went to was in Forbes Field in Pittsburgh.,1357430400,,219,4.341463414634147
4310668,2,B004AP3PO4,"I had hoped that the quality of the video would be  much better than it was,  instead during the middle and late innings of the game the video simply stopped.  I tried the dvd in other dvd players with the same results.  To say I am disappointed would be an understatment.  I truly expected better from Amazon.  I could have gotten this type of quality from some back street vendor.",1352073600,,382,4.385714285714286
4310669,5,B004AP3PO4,"Lost for just about 50 years in the basement of (at the time) part-time owner, Bing Crosby, this is the final game of one of the most interesting World Series of all time. For being 50 years old the picture quality is very good. The game itself is full of action (no pitcher's duel here) not to mention the best finish ever in a world series.

This two disc set is nicely done with lots of extras, my only complaint is simply this: in the post game celebration many Pirate players and management are interviewed, but noticeably omitted is Roberto Clemente, but I guess that is just a sign of the times.

I love the Pirates deeply and this an excellent moment in a very rich history of their franchise. If you love baseball I highly recommend this, if you love the Pirates, then you need to own this.

My Pirates will be relevant again, but until then I have this and the 1979 world series to get me through. Now only if I can get a 1971 release of some sort that would be awesome.

One final note: the fact that this series was against the mighty Yankees makes it all the more sweeter for me.",1337126400,,1092,4.260869565217392
4310670,5,B004AP3PO4,"What can one say about this DVD?  It is truly one of the most historic games in the history of baseball that featured four future Hall of Famers on the field as well as a pair of Hall of Fame announcers.  What is so remarkable about this is the fact that this game was just discovered several years ago at Bing Crosby's home.  The quality of the DVD is very good taking into consideration that it was broadcast over 50 years ago.  Actually the play by play is much better than today's constant babble that you hear.  Mel Allen and Bob Prince had a knack for always saying just the right thing at the right time.  They let the game provide the entertainment.  Today's announcers should listen to this game!  If you are a baseball historian, this is a must for your DVD collection!!!",1327795200,,781,4.375
4310671,5,B004AP3PO4,"I never got to see the game. I was 9, and in school, mostly day games then. It really brought back memories. Although you get to see a lot of footage of Clemente and Maz on sports shows, you don't see guys like Smokey Burgess, Bob Skinner or Dick Groat too often. Loved it!",1311638400,,273,4.074074074074074
4310672,5,B004AP3PO4,"I had only heard the radio broadcast of this all-time great game, but when my uncle told me that it was available on DVD, I jumped at the chance.  What a wonderful thrill it was to see the broadcast, since I wasn't even born when it originally was played.  It was fascinating to see what Forbes Field looked like and to see what many people (myself included) consider the greatest baseball game ever played.  Although the quality of the broadcast (a movie camera filming it off a TV) isn't the greatest, it's pretty good considering it's over 50 years old, from the earlier days of TV.  The bonus brief interviews with several players from both the Yankees and Pirates were a pleasant added touch.  So, thank you, Bing Crosby (former Pirates owner, as well as an all-time singer/actor), who had this game recorded for his later viewing and stored in his vault, for  people like me can now enjoy it so long after!",1311292800,2,912,4.564417177914111
4310673,5,B004AP3PO4,"What a magnificent find for baseball fans, both Pirate and Yankee fans alike!  Arguably one of the greatest Game 7's in World Series history:  the mighty Yankees against the underdog Pirates in a winner-take-all, teeter-totter battle for the crown of professional baseball!  Once given up as lost forever to those Pirate fans like myself, who had always heard about this epic game while growing up in Pittsburgh, but were too young to have witnessed it, we're now able to watch every pitch, every play.  Followers of the ""Bronx Bombers"" shouldn't overlook a chance to watch some of their Hall-of-Fame players (like Mantle and Berra) slugging it out in one of their last World Series appearances, but let's face it:  only Pirate fans will be smiling as Maz rounds the bases with the unbridled joy of a kid...!

The game is a microcosm for the 1960 Pirates:  a team that, all season long, seemed to find a way to battle back and win games -- and often in dramatic fashion.  The final game of the 1960 World Series has that same character -- with Maz providing the final, climactic bit of drama for a team that knew the meaning of the phrase ""never say die!""",1310947200,,1155,4.627450980392157
4310674,5,B004AP3PO4,"Just a correction to Dan Cillo and his article about the 1960 World Series. He states that there was no TV for either team of game 7, only radio.

One question I have is -- seeing all the newsreel cameras at this game -- what happened to all that film?  Could someone piece together full-length games from all the newsreels of the 1961 and 1962 World Series, etc. ?  I think there would be a market for it.",1305331200,,423,4.397435897435898

4310678,4,B004AP3PO4,"For starters, it's the complete game 7, 1960 World Series, thought to be lost to history; how bad can it possibly get?  But I give it a four rather than a five because I was disappointed with disc 2.  For starters, it should probably be disc 1 because the first thing  on the disc is a 45 minute recap of all seven games.  One should watch at least the first six games of this recap before viewing disc 1 just to set the stage.  Other features include interviews with Pirates Law, Smith and Maz and Yankees Berra, Richardson (Series MVP), Ford, Terry and Blanchard.  It's interesting how memories can work - or not.  These interviews were too short, the most thought provoking being Blanchard's (this interview being the source of how I titled this review).  The disc also includes a couple of other short Series recaps and it was interesting to see just how badly one of these could botch the facts so soon after the event (Movietone News).  Finally there's something called ""1960 Pirate Season Highlites""; it's not, absolutely nothing about the regular season in it, just a brief World Series recap.  This short does have one redeeming value.  It appears to have been digitally restored, so it's the highest quality video in the set.  If you're a fan of baseball and it's history, this is a must have, it doesn't get any better than game 7 of 1960 and it's there in full on disc 1.

Disc 2 has the official WS Highlight film (there is a better source that has been digitally restored--from BaseballDirect.com) but nevertheless, the WS highlight film is good quality.

The news reels look like they have been digitally restored.

By only major criticism is that the 1960 Season Highlight film is only an excerpt of the full 30 minute version (the full version is also part of the 1960 WS Highlight film from BaseballDirect.com).

A game where the 'defensive catcher' hits a three-run lead-changing home run. A game whose unmatched vicissitudes drove the most famous manager in baseball history into retirement. A game whose outcome produced the greatest public celebration in the history of a city founded before the American Revolution. And of course it is a game with the ""walk-off"" home run to end all walk-off home runs, the home run that not only ended a game but ENDED AN ERA.

Then pitcher Jim Coates unable to cover first and leading to the Yankees tying the score at 9-9 setting up Bill Mazeroski's dramatic home run in the Pirate's home 9th to win the World Series for the Pittsburgh Pirates for 1960. I was surprised at how well preserved this complete game 7 was, and contained both the television and radio coverage of this classic game. If you're a baseball fan, and particularly if you're a Pittsburgh Pirates fan, this game is a must. There is a bonus disc with highlights of the Pittsburgh Pirates 1960 season, a 1960 World Series newsreel and player interviews. If only Bing Crosby had been in charge of the saving and/or restoration of MLB classic games, we'd be seeing more great games like this one. Buy it!",1481155200,2,1099,4.555555555555555
8420628,5,B004AP3PO4,I was 12 years old and will never forget where I was when Maz hit that home run. One of the greatest memories of my life.  The DVD is pretty good quality for a game filmed 50 + years ago.  I enjoy it every time I watch it.,1479427200,,222,3.6041666666666665
