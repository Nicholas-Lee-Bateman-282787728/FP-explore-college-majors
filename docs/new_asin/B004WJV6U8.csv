Just really liked the soul sound of ""100 Miles from Memphis"" CD and this concert adds flavor to even her classics with a twist. It's different, and I really like it!! She seems like she is actually enjoying herself performing this style and this blu-ray really shows that. I have most of her concerts on DVD/blu-ray and this is my second favorite(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sheryl-Crow-Live-From-London/dp/B00080CPB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sheryl Crow: Live From London</a>&nbsp;being my favorite). The picture quality and sound quality of this latest release is a delight!
The change DID do her good!! It's not the same retread over again!
Crank it up! It sounds great!!",1308268800,11,797,5.65
4487078,5,B004WJV6U8,"Just watched this blu ray and once again I was very impressed with Shery Crow and her band.  I love the addition of the horns.  The set list is very good, would say it was great if Sign Your Name was in the show.  That is my favorite song on the new CD.  Regardless, this is still a excellent show, love the different version of I Shall Believe.  Video and sound are all excellent.",1307836800,10,381,4.094594594594595
4487079,5,B004WJV6U8,Great effort from Crow. Would we expect anything less then the best from her?!! The DVD made a tough day brighter for me. :),1307404800,5,124,4.208333333333333
4487080,2,B004WJV6U8,"I really like Sheryl Crow....have all her DVDs, have seen her live several times.  Her most recent album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/100-Miles-From-Memphis/dp/B003NWS5FO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">100 Miles From Memphis</a>&nbsp;isn't my favorite but its grown on me.  This concert represents in my humble opinion , a bored artist who like so many before her have tried to get in touch with a soul side they may or may not in reality have. For Sheryl to begin to re interpret her songs with a new urban vocal phrasing it just doesn't come off as authentic to me but posing in the soul world.  I know she grew up enjoying this music but that doesn't mean you can do it...heck the world is full of artists who were influenced by Elvis and The Beatles ...and many became legendary themselves but they had to go their own way instead of forcing bad imitations on the world. Its one thing to make an album that is for yourself and perhaps goes another direction but taking it on the road with todays inflated concert ticket prices and foisting not only 10 new songs on fans but reworking songs they know and love seems self indulgent to me. Hey...that's just my opinion which is what reviews are and I rarely write terrible reviews preferring to let others do that but I also think with budgets being what they are folks read these things to decide if and what to buy and I hope those on the fence might try one of Sheryl's other wonderful DVDs first if they are not completists as I am.

  Perhaps I'm just too much of the ""if its not broke don't fix it"" mentality but I think this is easily the least interesting Sheryl Crow show to date.  I don't mind artists trying to spread their wings and Sheryl has always grown as a songwriter on her albums to my ears. I just find the whole white artist trying to pretend they are black thing so played, tired and as George Carlin would say ""Lame"". By scrapping her band and covering the stage with black back up singers, horn players and band members it doesn't infuse her with soul it just makes her look and sound even more out of place and wrong.  Oh goodness some of this show is frankly cringe inducing...and when she trying to channel a REAL soul singer singing in a freelance and pathetic adlib ""what the F... is going on"" I am thinking as a viewer...that she read my mind.

As far as the video ...it seems desperately trying to invest this show with some current relevance and a hip factor by the use of angles,cuts,cropping and colors and only seems to point out the weakness of the actual musical content. Close ups of Sheryl's high heels just seem stupid...and Sheryl doesn't seem to be comfortable and know what to do with her arms without a guitar or Bass.

My goodness in the liner notes that come with this ,written by Sheryl, she has all the humility to call one of her song performances ""epic"". She named her band ""the Thieves"" and I was feeling robbed half way through watching this...but counted myself lucky that it was cheap and that I didn't actually go to the show that was filmed as it was in my town and I had considered going.

Sheryl is a great rock n roller...hall of fame material to my thinking and she just doesn't have the legitimate soul vocal chops to stand on a stage and pretend to be what she isn't. Get your guitar and your rock n roll band and do what makes you special is what I'd say to her and be a great Sheryl Crow instead of a wannabee Aretha...

LATE EDIT... I watched this again tonight, after getting over my initial disappointment and I have to add the LOW point has to be her scat singing after ""Strong Enough"" she talks/sings about looking for a man...laments that since the show is in LA she's probably already been with all the guys? Then sings that she's looking for a good man...one that could be a step father or father...(legit enough) then scats Republicans need not apply and he needs to make as much money as her...then after that loving thought...well maybe not spend as much as her"". And folks wonder why beautiful and talented women like her adopt and can't seem to find love?  Then...when I think I've lost all respect for her she redeems herself musically anyway, with two wonderfully performed tunes (the acoustic guitars are good and the background vocalists are very sympathetic with her) on Redemption Day and Long Road Home ...which are good enough to offset the prior scat lunacy and would cause me to rate this 3 stars.",1307232000,39,4477,4.588235294117647
4487111,5,B004WJV6U8,"This whole concert gives this artist & a phenomenal band to perform her songs with an r&b element. Sometimes she's rock, sometimes she's country, but you don't often hear her as r&b. Love it. Have watched it many times.",1410480000,,219,4.641025641025641

Sheryl Crow puts on a great concert, and this video production shows it!  The entire band looks like they are really enjoying their time on stage.  (The drummer is in a zone for sure!)

Back up was good, but sounded like they didn't rehearse much or didn't care to. Not worth the $7 I paid for it. Sad.",1365033600,,289,4.37037037037037

4487117,1,B004WJV6U8,I've seen Sheryl twice live and both shows were really fun. I had no idea she had dropped her longtime band.  The new band doesn't groove very well during most of the songs. I also have never liked doyle bramhall's guitar playing. His technique is so limited. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this dvd.,1342224000,2,304,4.333333333333333
4487118,5,B004WJV6U8,"I am a Sheryl Crow fan as much as I am a fan of other artists who have had hits I enjoy. However, I'm not a big Sheryl fan because she has a mediocre vocal quality and turns out songs that are enjoyable but lack a certain ""Wow!"" factor. She really turns in a great performance here.

This DVD and concert showed a side of Sheryl and her music we don't generally get to hear. There is a certain energy that comes through in a live performance that you never hear from a performer parked in front of a studio mic doing take after take. This performance was a far cry from the over-processed studio versions of Sheryl's music.  She was awesome and it was clear she was having fun. Her band was awesome. The addition of the horns and additional vocalists provided a fat sound. ...and that bass!

The video quality was excellent. I watched a large projected HD image with 5.1 surround. The mix brought out the live experience of this high-energy show very well.  I found myself smiling as I watched it the first time.",1318809600,4,1012,4.367021276595745
4487119,5,B004WJV6U8,"I'm not 100% sure why a previous reviewer slammed this concert.  When I listened to the usual hit songs, I enjoyed her singing and the band.  I am not a Sheryl Crow expert by any means, but I do have a few of her other concerts, and this one compares to them.

Ms. Crow is a little bit glib and and I guess that is what turned off a few  people.

If you are a Sheryl Crow fan or enjoy her music in general, buy it and just ""enjoy the show"".",1313366400,4,440,3.791208791208791
4487120,5,B004WJV6U8,"This new video by Sheryl Crow shows an excellent performance by the now mature singer and musician.  She has changed a bit from her earlier days , but her performances are still very enjoyable to me, and on video, you get an additional experience that you can't get on audio alone.  So I would highly recommend this DVD to any Sheryl Crow fan, or , for that matter, to any fan of this genre of music --- I'm not sure what to call it ?rock-ballad....",1309392000,3,449,4.270588235294118
