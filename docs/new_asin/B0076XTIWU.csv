5058455,5,B0076XTIWU,"This is an excellent, cold, cruel, realistic war movie quite free of most sentimentalism that demean the
cold and cruel realities of war. War is shown here in all its grim, non-sensical and insane reality. Men
are killed for the posession a mere hill of no value. Korean cinema can be excellent and this is a great
 example and this movie has to be rated as one of the very top War Movies we have seen. It deserves
5 stars and no less than 4 1/2. Strongly recommended !",1340582400,2,469,4.269662921348314
5058456,5,B0076XTIWU,"The last few years have seen an increase of war flicks by countries other than the U.S., and most of what's coming out is great.  While the dialog and acting at times may seem over dramatic or even cliche', the visuals are stunning.  'Front Line' is just as good as, if not better than 'Tae Guk Gi', another Korean film from a couple of years back.  For the war buff, this is a 'must have'.  The blood, guts and grit are all there and completely realistic.  Even though most of us have to read the english translations at the bottom, it doesn't seem to be too much of a detractor.  It's solid and worth the investment.",1340409600,5,618,4.2844827586206895
5058457,5,B0076XTIWU,This is just another Great Movie made by the Korean's. Its just a Civil War between the North & the South all over again! Great storyline & Great Action scenes.,1337212800,,160,4.366666666666666
5058458,5,B0076XTIWU,"Many a time, when I'm watching and truly enjoying a movie, I keep asking myself, ""How come this film did not receive a wider distribution when released - if released at all in the United States?"" I know that you probably feel the same way when watching an excellent so-called foreign or local art movie that you rarely heard or know about. This is what I felt when watching ""The Front Line,"" a quite magnificent and unforgettable film about war and what it does to human beings - simply powerful.

The movie stars Ha-kyun Shin as Kang Eun-pyo, a South Korean officer that is transferred to the intelligence unit against his will, and who is immediately sent to the eastern front. His mission is to investigate some alleged illegal behavior of the personnel in that area, which is one of the most brutal of the Korean War. He is told that there may be a spy in the so-called Alligator Company, because an officer was suspiciously assassinated with a South Korean bullet. It was important to put order in the eastern front, for there was a hill - the Aerok Hill - which was of strategic importance for determining the border between the two Koreas. Once at the front, Kang meets Kim Soo-hyeok (Soo Go), a fellow officer and great friend that he thought died few years back. He also discovers that the place is a mess, that morale is low, and discipline is almost non-existent. And it had to be that way, because, according to Kim, during his time with the Alligator Company, they have fought for Aerok Hill at least thirty times, loosing it and gaining it back. It was a never-ending, depressing cycle, due to stupid, easy decisions by the top brass. With time, Kang learns the truth about all the problems with the Alligator Company, and becomes part of the unit. Slowly and painfully, he realizes of the futility of this effort. His friend Kim, at one time, says, ""We could all be in hell, but hell can't be worse than here,"" and that ""winning the war is to survive, to stay alive."" And, sadly, he was right.

Directed by Jang Hun, ""The Front Line"" is awesome in every aspect. It has grandiose cinematography, impressive and realistic battle scenes, great acting, and touching and funny moments of camaraderie (especially provided by Sergeant Yang) - all of what makes a war movie great. In the end, they will all realize that their ""enemies weren't the commies but the war itself."" Described as the last battle of the Korean War, ""The Front Line"" is probably the best movie ever about this conflict - a must. I can't praise it enough. The Blu-ray + DVD edition of the film includes a king of documentary, highlights, and more. (South Korea. 2011, color, 133 min plus additional materials)

5058459,4,B0076XTIWU,"It's 1953 and The Korean War wages on. Negotiations for a ceasefire have been going on for over two years, but nothing has come of it. The South Korean group of men fighting at Aerok Hill is known as Alligator Company. Their commander was said to be shot with a gun from his own side and Intel says there's a spy residing in their midst. First Lieutenant Eun-Pyo (Ha-kyun Shin) of the Defense Security Command is sent to look into it. Once there, Eun-Pyo is reuinited with his best friend from college Su-Hyeok (Soo Go) who Eun-Pyo thought had died at the beginning of the war. But Su-Hyeok is not the man he used to be as his humanity has been stripped away, he doesn't think twice about killing anyone, and has somehow moved up in rank to Lieutenant in just two short years. But Alligator Company is hiding something that lies within the events that occurred at Po-hang and has left their current commanding officer Captain Il-Young (Je-hoon Lee) addicted to morphine.

Despite being a fan of horror, blood and guts, and explosions, war movies have always been the oil to my water. No matter how hard you stir or shake the two of us together we just don't mix and have decided to see other genres because of it. It's not that I think war movies are bad. They just haven't appealed to me in the past and every one I've tried to watch up until this point has been okay at best. Maybe it's because I'm getting older or that I'm beginning to notice more during movies, but The Front Line makes me reconsider that opinion and those feelings.

Ha-kyun Shin won me over as a fan with his performances in Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance and No Mercy For the Rude, so my expectations for the acting in this went up a few notches once I noticed him on-screen. Thankfully, those expectations weren't let down. Other than the general that speaks English in a scene very early on in the film, every person in the cast gives first-rate performances. Je-hoon Lee was really something. His addiction to morphine gives Il-young this mysteriousness to him. The last scene Il-Young is in will have you talking about him long after the movie is over. Soo Go was also fantastic. Su-Hyeok is relentless. Whatever happened during the time he was away from Eun-Pyo has made him cruel and relentless; almost a shadow of his former self. His eyes, facial expressions, and mannerisms help bring those feelings to fruition. Then there's Ha-kyun Shin who's just exceptional. He's just so emotionally absorbing. You can't help but glue your eyes to him whenever Eun-Pyo is around.

The brilliant cinematography and exceptional lighting add a lot to the film. The lighting felt very natural yet always added just the right amount of light so nothing was ever too dark. The camera work made it seem like you're running around in the trenches with these soldiers. The battlefield was this desolate wasteland littered with loud gunfire and clouds of smoke. Most of the colors are very washed out as browns, grays, and various shades of navy green are the majority of the colors used in the film. But then you see something like a bright blue tablecloth and it just jumps off the screen because of the washed out colors you're used to. Plants, bloodshed, snow, rain, fog, and forests make things appear to be momentarily richer than they really are.

The warfare isn't quite as gruesome as I was expecting. There was still quite a bit of blood, but it almost appeared to be more brown than red at times. Seeing somebody without an arm or a leg was a lot more unnerving. The orphans running around the Alligator Company camp bring out a few ""wow"" moments in the film. The chocolate bar scene and their scene with Su-Hyeok are both just heartbreaking.

I would argue that the drama almost outweighs the war in The Front Line, but then most of the drama is happening because of the war. So it's an endless cycle. It's a bit surprising how good The Front Line is though. With its rich cinematography, smooth storytelling, and passionate performances, it's difficult to argue its merit.",1335571200,25,4043,4.641061452513966
5058460,5,B0076XTIWU,"""He said our enemy wasn't commies, but the war itself."" Toward the end of Korean War Lieutenant Kang Eun-Pyo is sent to investigate a murder on the front lines. He reaches the area called Aerok Hill where the fighting is most intense. Soon after the truth is reveled a cease fire is signed and the two sides rejoice. But the war is far from over. This war movie interested me more then most of the recent ones. The main reason is that my grandfather served in the Korean War and there hasn't been a lot of movies made about that war. I was interested to see the stuff he refused to tell me about. After watching this I can see why. The movie is a Korean movie so the entire movie deals with a platoon of South Korean soldiers and their struggles. I have said before that for better or worse every war movie since it's release is compared to ""Saving Private Ryan"", and I never thought a movie could top that one. This is as close as I've seen and in some ways may be better. This is far and away better then ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" but like both of those movies you are so involved with the characters it is no longer a movie of nameless faces dying but people you feel a connection with. This movie makes you feel all kinds of emotions but the last half hour will make you feel things you never knew you could. Another example of how much power a movie has when it's done right. I highly recommend this movie. Overall, one of, if not the best war movie I have ever seen. I give it an A.",1332892800,37,1486,4.163194444444445
5058461,5,B0076XTIWU,"Yes another Korean War film about, yes, the Korean War and why not because they do make them so well. This one is about the last battle or properly battles that took place in the dyeing embers of that sad conflict (that is still officially not ended). All hills were strategic and Aerok Hill is one such command and has been taken and lost at least thirty times by Alligator Company of the South Korean Army.

Then their captain winds up dead and it is found that he has been killed by a South Korean bullet, yet he was reported K.I.A (killed in action), so a keen young Lieutenant of the Defence Security Command Kang Eun-Pyo is sent to the Front Line to investigate. On his arrival he finds the place in disarray and the man who has been in leading the men is an old friend Kim Soo-Hyeok (also supposedly K.I.A.) There is also a replacement Commander who from his corpulent appearance, has not spent much of the war on `exercises' unless that was to the kebab shop.

Kang Eun-Pyo starts investigating and starts to uncover small things but is generally met with a wall of silence. At the same time the truce negotiations rumble on but hostilities are not allowed to end - rather like World War I. So the killing continues and boy do we get a lot of that. Not only in battle but in the caves and the activities of some very cruel snipers. Korean films have garnered a reputation for making excellent war films, `Brotherhood', '71, Into The Fire' and `Assembly' and this is another to add to that list of quality if emotional films.

The action is frequent and top notch, it can be fairly bloody too and sometime quite personal. There is as ever a plethora of characters, with the seventeen year old green recruit to the gnarled veteran from the War of Liberation of WW II. We also have characters that are less than black and white which is always welcoming and a past event from 1950 in the failed landings at Pohang that still haunts the company. The weapons and uniforms are pretty much spot on and the CGi is so good you accept it as authentic.

There are a lot of emotional rants, but that goes with the territory and there is a bucket of not so subtle politicising. That is about reunification, a thread that runs from the start and through out the film, which some may find a bit of a stretch, to say why would be a plot spoiler. That all said this runs for just over two hours and held my attention from the very start and yes I was rooting for almost everyone, even the less heroic of the bunch. Director Hun Jang has done a great job with a great cast. The DVD has a whole disc of extras which has so much on it that it is like an extra film with a `making of' and loads more. In Korean with English sub titles this is a must for all serious fans of world cinema especially the ones with ruddy good battles in.",1332288000,10,2821,4.3069679849340865

5058522,4,B0076XTIWU,"The Front line is a truly exceptional war film unlike others that I have seen. Most films are about either World War 2, Vietnam, or something that happened in Iraq or Afghanistan. I am not saying that they are bad but it is nice to have a change now and again. I am glad that this is a Korean film because the US has its own bias on the war that happened there but I wanted a truly Korean viewpoint on the war whether or not I agree with it. I like to see the perspectives of different sides of war and with this film, I was able to see a completely new side.

The actors in the film are likable and easy to get attached. There is a good bit of back story to the film which I feel were well executed without taking away from the main plot too much. The expressions and sentiment depicted on the film really had me feeling for the soldiers who were constantly fighting back and forth to claim a hill.

The film covers a range of topics from morality in times of war to the feelings the soldiers from the opposite sides had for one another. The only problems I had with the film is that I felt that the timing was off in a couple of parts. Sometimes I would be hooked into the story line but then I would get quickly distracted on other parts.

In the end, I have to admit that this movie is not for the faint of heart but anyone willing to go through two hours of how the korean war was like to soldiers should sit through this.",1420070400,,1427,4.035335689045937

Film: Easily one of the best war films to come out in the past 10 years. Very well written and acted out. South Korea continues to impress me with the amount of solid film offerings they come out with. I don't know that I have ever watched a film portray how senseless war is better than this one does. For many Americans the tv show MASH is often identified the most with the Korean war. This is the first film about that war that I have watched that really showed it from a Korean perspective. Don't miss this one!

PQ: Excellent video presentation. It has a rather washed out look by design. Detail is excellent.

AQ: This film will rock your sound system. Excellent sound design and editing. Puts you right in the battle.

Conclusion: If you enjoy solid storytelling, acting and writing you will appreciate what the film makers have accomplished on this one. This is catnip for lovers of the war film genre. The production quality and entertainment value of this is comparable to The Pacific, Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan and some of the other best war films of the past 20 years or so.

5058541,5,B0076XTIWU,"An outstanding Korean film depicting the savagery in battle displayed by both sides in the Korean Conflict.  The intensity of the battle scenes is juxtaposed with the periods of comparative calm between the assaults on a bit of real estate.  The possession of this site at the beginning of the armistice will determine the line at which the border will be drawn.

Seeing men, on both sides, being forced to subject themselves to danger, horror and death is intense and stunning.  The relationships determine the reasons the men (and a few women) keep fighting, return for assault after assault.  Some are ideologues, a few are thrilled by the danger.  There are patriots, cowards and all the types you expect to see.  In the final analysis, most fight for the same reason as most of the others, for the man standing beside them doing the same thing.  It's not for country, family or cause, but just because the man beside you is expecting it.",1384992000,3,942,4.736196319018405

I wished the voice was in English rather than in their native language, but hey, it added a sense of realism to the movie.  The other aspect of the movie that I liked was the different twist and turns the movie took from the beginning to the end.

Aside from the superior movie-making from a technical standpoint, the plot, the acting, and the history is quite compelling.

5058550,5,B0076XTIWU,"The Front Line is centered around the 1953 ceasefire. Kang Eun-pyo is sent to investigate the death of the Alligator Company commanding officer, who was killed by a South Korean bullet, and the possibility of a North Korean spy. As he arrives, he runs into a friend he believed was dead, Kim Soo-hyeok, and eventually begins to realize the horrors and true impact of war. The Front Line is an intense and powerful war film.

The story in The Front Line manages to be entertaining and effective; it conveys very important messages and meaning, but doesn't feel like it preaches. The film blends drama and action very well; we get very immersive and engaging dialogue/conversations, and exhilarating action/war sequences. For example, there are a few emotional scenes where a sniper pins down the soldiers using a brutal bait tactic. The ending of the film was stunning and thought-provoking.  The acting is amazing from the entire cast, and this makes the experience feel authentic. I also enjoyed the music in this film.

Overall, The Front Line is a deep and innovative war drama with an amazing cast and ending. As of 12/26/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is highly recommended.

The Front Line has strong violence and gore, and nudity.",1358380800,,1270,4.920560747663552

5058553,4,B0076XTIWU,"Set in the last days of the Korean War, ""The Front Line"" follows the story of a South Korean intelligence officer Kang Eun-pyo (Ha-kyun Shin), sent to the front line of the fictional Aerok Hills (Korea read backward), in order to investigate the possible murder of the commanding officer. It is also suspected that someone in the Alligator Company, renowned as the best soldiers of the army, might be receiving letters from the opposing North Korean forces.

Kang Eun-pyo arrives at the front line, where he rejoices at the sight of Kim Soo-hyeok (Soo Go), his long-missing friend. His joy is short-lived, however, since he is soon dismayed at things are turning out. The new commanding officer is arrogant and incompetent. The soldiers are tired and ill-equipped. The negotiations for cease-fire go on and on.

Those who are familiar with South Korean-made war movies (like ""Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"") know that there is a certain set of conventions in this genre, such as emotional stories that are often about two protagonists, and fierce military action sequences. ""The Front Line"" has both of them, a dramatic storyline and powerful combat sequences, and it works.

With a few twists in the plotline and several credible characters we can relate to, ""The Front Line"" (South Korea's submission to the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film) is a compelling war drama. The film is overlong and the plotline melodramatic, but the experience is rewarding.",1354492800,,1473,5.028688524590164
5058554,5,B0076XTIWU,"I was surprised and impressed by this highly original and very well interpreted film - and I believe it is one of the best war movies I have seen ever (and I saw A LOT of them).

This is the story about a South Korean counter-intelligence officer, Lieutenant Kang Eun-pyo, who during the last months of Korean War is affected to an infantry company (Alligator Company) which recently lost an important position, the Aerok Hill and which commander died in suspiscious circumstances. This and also some other inteligence seems indicate, that there is a North Korean agent infiltrated amongst the soldiers. Kang's mission is to identify this man. But once he arrives to his new unit he finds much, much more than he expected. And also, Aerok Hill must be retaken - at any cost...

All this covers the first five minutes of the film and I will say no more here - you deserve to discover this excellent film by yourself.

The scenario is very, very good and very original. This film is different from anything else I ever saw. Surprises are many and we do not see most of them coming. Things described are very believable and people act logically, although the logic can be sometimes a little bit... odd. With the time we start to develop an attachment to some characters, like the drug addicted Captain Shin, the veteran of anti-Japanese guerrilla Master-Sergeant Yang and even the cold and cruel Lieutenant Kim. At one moment we even have an insight into the minds of North Korean soldiers (in a rare moment when no political officer is present) and frankly I was pretty impressed by those scenes.

Action scenes are exceptionally good, and certainly better than in the more renowned ""Brotherhood"". Great attention was given to the details concerning weaponry and uniforms. South Korean soldiers are armed with M1 Garand semi-automatic rifles, M1 semi-automatic carbines, Browning BAR light machine guns, 60 mm light American mortars and Colt M1911 pistols. North Koreans have Mosin 1891 rifles (and also for one of them a Mosin 1891/44 sniper rifle), PPSh-41 sub-machine guns, Maxim-Putilov 1910 heavy machine guns, 82 mm Soviet mortars and Mauser 1896 pistols. I couldn't find one mistake concerning military equipement.

The final battle and the final scene are amongst the most powerful things I ever saw on screen. I will say no more here, but believe me, if you like war films, you WANT to see the last 15 minutes of this film.

Bottom line, this is an exceptionnally good film, of highest quality, in my modest opinion better in every aspect than ""Brotherhood"". I am keeping my copy preciously and I recommend it with all my heart.",1353974400,,2635,4.844444444444444
5058555,5,B0076XTIWU,"There is more to this movie than the reviews can describe! It is full of much action and warfare, which takes place in the last months of the killing in 1953. What is depressing is that after all these soldiers have been through, they make it to the end of the violence and begin to celebrate the idea of going home again. Then they are told by the idiots in High Command that the armistice won't take place for another 12 hours, so they have to go and risk their lives shooting at more North Korean troops until then. I can't imagine the thoughts that ran through their minds!!!

What happened after that and before? Watch the movie! South Korea makes a good war movie about the Korean War. Now if only the USA moviemakers would get off their butts and try to make one too---the only flick we have related to the Korean War is the TV show MASH for crying out loud!",1352332800,,865,4.274390243902439

5058558,5,B0076XTIWU,"Living is never just one thing.  Lots of things are going on at the same time in real life, and they often contradict each other.  In war, for example, friendship and crass rivalry-- as well as compassion and murderous rage at one another-- can all occur simultaneously.  Characters we may have come to care about deeply live and die for all the right reasons, for all the wrong reasons, or for no reason at all-- all in the same instant of whizzing bullets or exploding shells.  A soldier we come to like and admire obtains a photo off of an anonymous dead enemy portraying a pretty girl he swears he will find to marry after the war; only for her to turn out to be a sniper on the other side who takes his life from a impersonal long distance.  This movie has the grace and wisdom to make all its opposing possibilities seem to fit together organically, into a continuously coherent story.  And each time one thinks the movie has ended, it picks up again with some further wrinkles . . . just like life!  For a long time, people have turned to the arts and religion to punctuate and frame experience-- to reassure them that eventuality is not as random and as full of contradictions, or of things that don't belong together standing side by side-- as it really is.  So we have typically been regaled with protagonists and  antagonists, each type drawn very sharply, reassuring us that the world is indeed just a black and white India ink pen drawing . . . with a resolvable beginning, middle, and end.  Once in a while, however, a true colorist emerges, and we are subjected to the multi-hued nature of genuine existence.  Not everybody can handle that sort of exposure, and it can be very challenging in an initially confusing (ground shaking) sort of way.  I urge you to buy this movie and see how you manage it.  Allow its many-stranded course of events to touch you emotionally.  Then indulge in a bit of soul searching about what happened inside you as you watched . . . and maybe why.  Good luck, and enjoy.  The experience will certainly be worth it.",1349568000,,2059,4.494623655913978
5058559,2,B0076XTIWU,"Unlike some Western war movies that a) pack a punch in 1hr 45min, b) have a script that promote and demand a compassionate response from the watcher, I was sadly bored to death by this movie.

It may be due to the translation, it may be due to the social and cultural differences between Korea and myself; though I have many excellent Korean movies.  I just didn't feel moved by this movie in the scenes that were obviously contrived to do so.  The acting, script and direction just flopped.  Yes there are scenes with arms coming off and blood spurting, but that's not what makes a god war movie; that only adds a sense of realism for all you armchair soldiers who have never felt the pain of combat (and that includes me).

Sorry, I just don't agree with all the hype this movie gets, it really isn't worth 5 stars.",1349481600,2,817,4.3841059602649
5058560,4,B0076XTIWU,"Yup. War is Hell and sometimes hell is being stuck in something insanely stupid. That's pretty much of what this Korean War based film is all about.

Here's the scoop. The North and South Koreans have been negotiating a peace for two years, and one of the sticking points is a hill that seems to switch occupation, between the two, on a near daily basis. An intelligence officer from the South is sent to said hill because there is evidence of a mole in the troops. He gets there to find a truly cock-eyed situation in place.

This is one of the best war movies ever made. That it deals with the Korean War is a plus because few films concern that conflict. I also like that it deals entirely with Korean troops. There is only one round eye, an officer, in the film. But it is a bizarre situation. Yes the two sides fight each other, but because they trade occupation of the hill so regularly, they leave gifts of booze, cigarettes and the like for each other. They deliver mail for each other as well. The intelligence officer comes to realize this is not a normal situation. But the war rages on and both sides go through the charade of taking the hill and giving it back again.

This is a beautifully shot and directed film. The characters are drawn and acted well. The prelude to the final, insane battle I did not believe. I liked it. I wanted to believe it but couldn't. There were a couple of other parts of scenes that were a bit over dramatic for my taste but this is still the best of the best as far as war films are concerned.",1345334400,4,1538,4.296551724137931
5058561,5,B0076XTIWU,"Actually my first time that I've seen a Korean made movie.  I've watched Downfall, the German made movie about Hitler's last days and found that to be excellent.  This movie is better although admittedly much different.  Not a true comparison but more so an observation about the high quality of filmmaking from certain foreign films. The story has been described so no reason to revisit that.  The acting was top notch and I found myself to be truly engaged by the characters.  A couple of powerful dramatic scenes as the characters struggle over good and bad and the horrors of war.  The battle scenes were reminiscent of Saving Private Rupyan and HBO's The Pacific.  Upon watching, you will definitely want ""Two Seconds"" to be taken out.  I'll say no more but believe you'll have the same feeling.  Excellent film that is a must for any war buff.  Highly recommend to buy and not rent.  You'll want to watch again.",1345248000,3,917,4.70440251572327
5058562,5,B0076XTIWU,"""Do you guys know why you are losing?  Because you don't know the reason you are fighting.""  (Paraphrase)  A North Korean commander lectures a group of South Korean prisoners during the opening weeks of the war, and surprisingly, let's them go because he believes that the war will be over soon.  This line is one of the key quotes that fuses this well-built war drama together: to show the ferocity, the futility, and cruelty during a war of attrition...and both sides lose.

Lt. Kang Eun-pyo from Counter Intelligence is given an assignment in the last few weeks of the Korean War, during the close of the long and arduous truce talks between North Korea/China and South Korea/The UN.  Reports from the Eastern Front show that there is a spy within the Republic of Korea camp, where there are letters being sent out from the North Korean side to the South, and a commanding officer was shot...with a bullet from a South Korean weapon.  Eun-pyo and a new CO, along with a raw recruit, head to the front to find a dazed and battle-hardened ""Alligator Unit.""  This unit has been fighting back and forth against the enemy for the Aerok Hills, which up to this point in the movie has been lost and won several times.  Eun-pyo finds unusual circumstances among the camp such as a very young captain who is addicted to morphine, a crazy soldier who keeps asking ""where is 2nd platoon,"" and finally running into his best friend Su-hyeok whom he thought he lost during the North Korean invasion.  Everything is changed and the will to battle is more about orders rather than patriotism.  We find later that there are moments of compromise and cooperation between the Northern and Southern sides in a very unusual plot twist.

As the story unfolds, the director sets the atmosphere of attrition and the viewer gets a feel of how grueling it must be for this unit to survive and do their best to keep their sanity.  The opening battle scenes watching the ROK soldiers climbing the hills to dislodge the North Koreans is bitter, long, and tough to watch.  Later in the film the North takes it back, which leaves a feeling of void to see the waste of life over a few miles of land (ala WWI).  You see the film as not of a story of courageous men who feel that they must finish the war, but of a tired unit who wants to go home.  You see scenes of the North Koreans as well who have this same mood in their camp.  Each character is haunted by their past, but at this point the fatigue of war has clouded the judgment of each soldier to the point where survival vs. right and wrong rule their decisions.  Eun-pyo comes to this realization and is horrified, but slowly towards the end he too sees why the soldiers do these things.

This has been one of the more better war films I have seen in a while, especially for a foreign war film.  Though over dramatic at times, I felt it has done a better job in many areas to display the reality of war compared to the other blockbuster film, ""Taegukgi."" The violence is raw and ferocious, but you see that this film also displays humor, camaraderie, depth, and fairness to both sides.  It has elements of Catch-22 of fighting a losing battle while the truce talks are going on, especially after everyone loses reason to fight.  A must recommended film to see the human price paid for a war that has destroyed a nation: where war is now meaningless and where minds break.",1342396800,3,3400,4.503257328990228
5058563,5,B0076XTIWU,"Ranks up there with 'Tae Guk Gi' and any war film buff won't be disappointed as the action is intense and very well done production wise. Much like other Korean war films, the local filming efforts capture the in your face brutality and hatreds that still linger across fortified borders in Korea. The storyline is routine, a unit of soldiers must cope with death and misery and frustration while fighting a bitter enemy bent on their destruction. Heroics only seem part of survival and everyone would rather be elsewhere. The battle sequences are top notch, weaponry, uniforms and especially the bunker and trench scenes are superior to many other war films. Quality efforts in production make this one shine as it does capture the beast of war and shoves your face right into the mud and sweat and makes the viewer appreciate being able to sit in ones chair with the remote and a cold beer and not have to endure these modern horrors called war.
