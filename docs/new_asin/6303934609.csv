7855474,5,6303934609,I am a old movie buff and when the VHS no longer held up I was thrilled to find this oldie but goodie and in very good shape as well!!!!,1516492800,,136,3.566666666666667
7855475,1,6303934609,"Alpha Video has recorded this movie at EP (6 hour) speed which saves them tape and costs the viewer a respectable quality of picture. I am handy with the tracking device, however I don't appreciate having to make continuous adjustments during this movie. The picture quality remained abysmal dispite all my efforts and I will not buy another of their products EVER.",1196985600,,365,4.903225806451613
7855476,3,6303934609,"This 1934 film is an interesting historical drama. Flora Robson is wonderful as the Empress Elizabeth, intelligent and politically astute, though wanton. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. is well cast in the role of the Grand Duke Peter, playing him as a weak, lascivious, rake of a fellow. The role of Catherine is well played by Elisabeth Bergner.

At first, Catherine, a German princess intent only upon marrying the Grand Duke Peter, the man to whom she has been promised since she was ten, seems to be a humble, simple soul. They marry, and Peter proceeds to treat Catherine badly, humiliating her at every turn. When his aunt, the Empress, dies and Peter becomes Emperor, it becomes clear that he is not fit to rule. Catherine, however, tries to ameliorate some of Peter's harsh edicts and rulings.

It soon becomes clear as time passes that it is Catherine who is fit to rule and in the interest of Russia to see to it that she does. How this comes about, and what happens to ensure that Catherine becomes Empress, is interesting, making it a film worth watching. Unfortunately, I do not know whether this film is historically accurate or not. It is moderately entertaining, nonetheless, with good performances by the entire cast.",1160438400,,1226,4.833333333333333
