8372803,5,B002LFPB7E,"I was so annoyed at the two bad reviews that ruined the rating for this wonderful DVD that I felt I should put my ""two cents"" in.  The Christmas Album has always been one of my favorites of course and I found the three Christmas scenes to be beautiful.  Another thing I liked was that you can choose to view the scenes with or without the music, if you want to hear the crackling fire you can.  :)",1332806400,7,397,4.064102564102564
