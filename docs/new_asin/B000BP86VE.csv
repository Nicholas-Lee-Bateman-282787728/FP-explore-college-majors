2434693,4,B000BP86VE,"Antony Sher's Leontes was, for me, one of the highlights of this production.  His interpretation was intelligent, consistent and logical.  Another strength of this production was, for me, the set--very fluid and three dimensional.  I love to see Shakespeare live onstage, but the next best thing is to see a taped live performance.",1328918400,9,331,5.2075471698113205
2434694,5,B000BP86VE,"It is a bit of a clich to call A Winter's Tale a problematic play, but I'll confess I've always found it more interesting than truly masterful. This production, however, solves most of the problems I find just reading the words on the page.  Of particular note is Antony Sher's Leontes, who manages to make the monarch's lightning turn from loving husband to jealous madman credible (as seemingly difficult as successfully carrying off Richard III's wooing of Lady Anne), and so well does this production sustain the tension that, when Hermione's death is announced near the end of the third act, the impact is visceral in its power.  Acts IV and V, of course, display a radical shift in tone, but here the shepherd's interlude is genuinely entertaining (as opposed to tedious), helped in no small measure by Ian Hughes' scene-stealing turn as Autolycus.  I was curious how the bear effect and disguises were going to be handled, and though I feared the worst, I was pleasantly surprised in both instances.  This leaves only the resolution in Act V that I find (from the source material) rather drawn-out and silly; I understand it is only a ""tale,"" but I just don't believe it really works.  This production does nothing to change that view, although I'll freely admit, the fault is probably mine (it must be, since this is often called one of the most touching scenes in the canon).  On the whole, this is about as good a filmed Shakespearean stage production as I have seen, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to those interested in the play.  One quibble: there is no subtitle option, which would be useful were I ever to decide to teach the play in the future.",1266019200,58,1671,4.6825938566552905

I'm no fan of productions of Shakespeare's plays that employ modern settings, or period settings that are clearly later than the time setting of the play itself. This RSC production of The Winter's Tale is, judging by costume, clearly set in the period 1890-1914, so that references to the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, ""Sicilia"", ""Bohemia"" are distracting anachronisms. All the same, Hermione and Perdita are well played, and once one gets used to the fact that one is seeing a film of a staged play things go along fairly well.  Autolycus steals the show, I'm afraid. He is very entertaining, but as an embodiment of the principle of error, surrender to the impulses of ""stronger blood,"" he cannot be taken seriously, and so the play's central theme which binds the last two acts to the first three is not well served. Nevertheless I liked the DVD well enough to use it in my undergraduate Shakespeare class.",1231804800,17,1175,5.8654970760233915
2434696,5,B000BP86VE,"This filmed stage recording is indeed magical. I believe a former critic's particular critique in this regard should be regarded in the light of two distinguishing characteristics of Shakespeare on film: whether the production is a film interpretation or a filmed stage production. This DVD is the latter: over-the-top FX, panoramic view and the like don't necessarily apply. Here one has the magic of being in the audience at a grand performance of the Royal Shakespeare Company, with the added pleasure of being granted close-ups! The acting is all-around sublime, especially Ian Hugh's Autolycus; I've yet to see a rogue interpreted better.

For a contrast of what can be accomplished with Shakespeare as film interpretation versus filmed stage production, compare Orson Welles' Othello with Richard Burton's Hamlet (both available through Amazon); both, I believe, are the ideal of each venue.",1182297600,41,897,5.4071428571428575

2434702,1,B000BP86VE,"I love stage plays. Really, I do. However, the magic of theatre does not translate well to television.

2434705,3,B000BP86VE,"I actually found that this play did a good job of making a rather difficult play accessible. I was particularly impressed with the way Leontes was played ... just verging on madness, and still somewhat sympathetic.

Warning though: The ""Shepherd's Interlude"" is extremely bawdy. This is *not* a play to show young people without editing that part out. I have no idea why such a fine play in so many other ways resorted to such a low and vulgar interpretation, as it is not necessary to Shakespeare's play nor toward making the scene funny. So, beware if you are planning to show this to kids (as I embarrassingly did) without viewing it first and marking where you want to cut and jump scenes.",1357257600,5,693,4.634146341463414
2434706,1,B000BP86VE,"I find it outstanding that there are so many high ratings for this, although at the time of writing this there are only a total of 6 reviews.  Right from the start the acting in this production is too cerebral, thus making it boring.  I don't believe a word that comes out of any of the actors' mouths, because they are simply not living out the life of the play, but rather performing on an external level.  I like Sher's work on tv/film, but in this play I was astonished that he was so insincere in this role.  To attempt to make moments intense he resorted to shouting, which was not only false but made it difficult to understand what he was saying.  Hermione sounded as if she was struggling to breathe,and spoke on a scale of only 2 notes - very irritating to listen to for more than 5 minutes, and Perdita was very unappealing to say the least.  Across the board the majority of the actors 'mouthed the text' instead of bringing it to life.
I won't go into the costumes/sets because, which were beautiful.  Without a spectacular cast, as should be expected of The Royal Shakespeare Company, none of that matters in the least.
I recommend checking out Christopher Plummer's performance of Prospero in the Tempest (Stratford Festival of Canada) to see some impeccable Shakespearean acting.",1343001600,7,1295,4.62882096069869
8090525,4,B000BP86VE,"The acting in this version of Winter's Tale was great, especially the character of Hermione. The video quality was good enough that it didn't hinder the experience. (Watching a play being acted is just different than watching a movie.) About halfway through I was abruptly reminded that Shakespeare was sometimes a bawdy bard!! I felt this interpretation of the play to be within the realm of what might have actually been performed, but if you're easily offended, or if you plan to share this with kids, you'll want to preview it first.",1518652800,,537,4.8478260869565215

I bought this one based on reviews here. We are familiar with the bawdiness in his plays, especially the comedies and romances. Usually the lines or gestures go right over my children's heads, but I should have previewed this one. In Act IV there is a dance at the shepherd's that goes a bit too far. We were all quite embarrassed and I quickly fast forwarded past that part. Otherwise, the acting is well done and we enjoyed it.",1478131200,5,603,4.592592592592593

8090534,4,B000BP86VE,"Last night I watched this new DVD of The Winter's Tale by William Shakespeare. Until recently, the BBC version was the only one on DVD, and it is a perfectly serviceable production of this minor play. But this new DVD of the 1998/1999 Royal Shakespeare Company version is much better. I would have enjoyed it more if it were about a half hour shorter. In Shakespeare's day, when you went to the theater that was probably the only entertainment you saw in a week, and you wanted it to last. This play has it all: tragedy, comedy, romance, singling, dancing, music, and stand-up comedy. Today we have shorter attention spans. What can you say about a Shakespeare play in which the most famous lines are a scene setting: ""Bohemia, a seacoast"" and a stage direction: ""Exit, pursued by a bear""? But the Royal Shakespeare Company make the most of both the pathos and the comic turns.",1433548800,12,877,4.628205128205129
