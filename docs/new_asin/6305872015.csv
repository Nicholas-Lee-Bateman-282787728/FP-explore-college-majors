7896934,3,6305872015,"Most the reviews are pretty on target.  The script is not the best for the talent that is in this movie, but they made it work.  However, the sex scene between Rachel Hunter and Eric Roberts accompanied by excellent background music makes it the coolest looking I've seen on film so far.",1205452800,2,287,4.5

7896936,5,6305872015,"This is a great story with an impressive cast.  Supermodel Rachel Hunter gives a noteworthy performance as Susan Price, a woman on the run who's been framed for murder.  Hunter loses her fortune, changes her identity and  becomes a relay operator for the hearing impaired to catch the real killer.  Hunter's on-screen chemistry with veteran bad boy actor Gary Busey is  impressive.  This supermodel can act.  Hearing impaired actor Anthony  Natale (Mr. Holland's Opus) gives a satisfying performance, as does A.J.  Johnson.  Rachel Hunter has remarkable chemistry with her co-stars, however  the saving grace of this movie is Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin, who  delivers a sexy performance as the deaf District Attorney who is caught in  a web of murder, betrayal and sexual deceit.  In a clever script by  first-time writer Ted Williams ""Two Shades of Blue"" takes us  behind closed doors of interesting characters who reveal their darker side.  Ted Williams does a nice job exposing us to the often ignored voyeuristic  world of the hearing impaired.  What's particularly interesting about this  movie is the realistic behind-the-scenes look at the relay service for the  deaf, and how it works.  Matlin, in what may be the steamiest performance  of her career, shows us that deaf people can be sexy too, and she does so  in good taste.  Eric Roberts is always worth mentioning.  Roberts makes the  film fun to watch and he is obviously having fun playing Calvin Stassi: the  two-timing villain who womanizes Hunter and Matlin.
The film's technical  credits fall short of sophomoric.  First-time director James Deck seems to  have been asleep at the helm, leaving these great actors to fend for  themselves.  The visual style required for this genre would have been  better off in the hands of a seasoned director such as Martin Scorsese or  Brian De Palma.  However, there is little wonder why Marlee Matlin and the  other stars were attracted to the script. It's an intriguing and  well-written story.  With Rachel Hunter in nearly every scene, the film is  a worth while attempt at what otherwise, could have been a brilliant murder  mystery.",960595200,14,2151,5.031428571428571
