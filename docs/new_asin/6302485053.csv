472960,5,6302485053,"Wow. This movie has it all. Action, comedy, and horror.
The gore is great, and the rape/murder scenes are disturbing. The comedy keeps you laughing, and laugh you will.
Though I could have done without the  endless spectacle of the three stupid college pals' friendship, once the  mayhem gets rolling in this flick you will have a great time (the close  look on the three friends' relationship has its moments, however).
The  beginning is surprising, gory and funny (a horror fan's dream), and the  ending...well, I'm not going to give it away, but let me just say that you  NEVER SAW IT COMING! And the funny thing is, you should have. The ending  is, without a doubt, SHOCKING. Buy this movie just for the ending if you  have to.
This little gem of the 80s is HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!",916704000,2,783,4.6231884057971016

This is a small film probably made on a dime but for what they did they actually made a great film. I do on the one hand feel bad that Troma put this out, I know, it was made by Loyds brother and i love Troma but it is not a Troma film at all, if you go into this expecting Toxie or a bevy of nude woman your not going to be happy. But if you want to see a twisted horror classic that is sorrily forgotten in some circles then you will be happy.

473371,5,6302485053,"Mothers Day has been a Favorite genre piece of mine since I saw it
in 1980..The movie itself is campy ,fun and very violent yet packs a few ironic twists.

As a woman I hate rape scenes but know that in these types of films they are necessary to really get the horrific nature of the story to resonate in your mind and to make whatever happens later all the more effective,It's in the vein of 'I Spit on Your Grave' because this is somewhat of a revenge film and a film not only about the vulnerability of women but also the strength that we as woman have when push comes to shove.

There are some over the top gore effects but in this type of film it works .It is after all a Troma release. When in a panic anything can be used as a weapon such as a can of Drano,a Television,an electric Carving Knife and even a breast shaped blow up pillow.

473375,1,6302485053,"<strong>Mother's Day</strong> (Charles Kaufman, 1980)

If you follow my reviews, you know I'm a big fan of crap-horror. I am not one, normally, to look for redeeming social value in anything I watch. And therefore, when I say something has no redeeming social value, that's not the same as Jesse Helms saying it. As far as I'm concerned, the Joe Bob trifecta of things that make a good movie--blood, [censored for Amazon consumption], and beasts--are enough to stand on their own as far as redeeming social value goes, as long as you give me the thinnest, stupidest plot to hold them together and a modicum of characterization. All of which is a long-winded preface to my saying that <em>Mother's Day</em>, Charles Kaufman's second and by far most famous movie, has no redeeming social value whatever. It's a slasher that tries to redeem its utterly generic structure by throwing in some redneck stereotype variants. Because, you know, that had never been done before (hey Charlie, 1972 called, it wants its <em>Deliverance</em> back). Which would be okay, and might have actually worked, had any of the film's characters actually had enough depth to make them anything but stereotypes. But no, cute college girls vs. rednecks, and one side has weaponry. You know how this is going to go, and Kaufman does nothing in the way of varying the structure with an eye toward unpredictability; you can probably plot out exactly how this thing is going to go before you even turn it on. Given how many times this has been done, and how many times it has been done better, there is absolutely no reason to watch this. ",1327449600,5,1609,4.826086956521739

They made Roger Corman seem like a major studio - and this was shocking and bizarre in its day but now, really - just an amateur production with camcorders. Now that people can shoot and edit masterpieces with special effects using a $600 Mac, this is pretty much a yawner. And after the snuff porn of the last few years, this is a walk in the park with a lab puppy if you're talkinga bout its shock value (and that's presuming you never saw any Italian horror movies or American grindhouse films of the 1970's)... and the worst sin of all, for a camp movie about kidnapping young women, there's no nudity. So, if you've lead a sheltered life and have seen only just THE SOUND OF MUSIC, this movie might shock you but otherwise, it's not very good, its camp value is nil, there's no nudity and it's not scary. It's only interesting in a historical context for film buffs.

473480,4,6302485053,"Mother's Day is a classic piece of early 80's cinema that demandingly pelts the viewer with violence, gore, black humor and wit.  This is more than a low budget splatter-fest and if you keep your eyes and ears peeled you'll catch all kinds of sub-texts and social commentaries that this type of picture is usually devoid of. Not surprisingly, Mother's Day remains as caustic and telling 25 years after its release as it was in 1980.

The storyline is simple, three former college co-eds escape the city for a weekend of relaxation in the woods.  Of course relaxation is the last thing that these city twits are gonna get because brothers Ike and Adly are hell bent on having their way with them, and rest is certainly not on the menu.

The girls are dragged unmercifully to the inbreds' shack and are formally introduced to Mother. Mother approves of their latest earmarks, ""Boys, you've made your mother very proud."" From here on out the girls are tortured and raped, humiliated and debased in a variety of savage ways.

All the while Ike and Adly spout sound bytes from movies, music and television.  They almost have their own language that only they can understand-like they're speaking in code. To the girls' dismay part of their torture includes pantomiming scenes from the clan's favorite movies. This type of behavior somehow validates these red-necks and they come away thinking that they are normal; or better yet, ""citified.""

This brood of backwards hill-jacks are a poisoned by-product of heartless, soulless Pop culture.  They've O.D.'d on saccharine soaked cinema and gimmicky bullsh*t rock. Ike and Adly are intellectually incapable of recognizing fiction from nonfiction. They are violent and impulsive because that is exactly what they see and hear day in and day out on the tube. It's interesting to note that Mother's Day appears to be reacting to the very type of film that it is-though I don't think that was the directors intent.

Eventually one of the girls dies and it's up to the other two to avenge her death and boy do they!  Axes to the groin, multiple stabbings and a gullet full of Drano do the boys in, but Mother gets extra special treatment as she is suffocated by a transparent inflatable pillow shaped like a pair of C cup breasts. Fantastic!

Unfortunately Mother's Day has yet to find its real footing in horror movie history, but in time it most surely will. What it lacks in plot and character development, is more than made up for with charm, cleverness and extensive bloodletting.  Mother's Day could be considered the first Troma film, though in 1980 Troma was only a glimmer in the eye of Lloyd Kaufman.  It would be 6 more years before Tromaville begat its gut buster of a splatter pic-The Toxic Avenger.

473484,5,6302485053,"I'm obsessed with this movie! When i first saw it in the theatres back in the 80's, this movie was severely cut due to the graphic violence. I love everything about this movie, from the casting, to the location shots, to the storyline and acting. For those unfamilar with the Troma movies, Troma is a company that specializes in grade B horror/sci-fi exploitation flicks. Many of the Troma movies have a very dark and twisted sense of humor to them, in additon to the drama and suspense or horror. Mother's Day is no exception. The story is about three girls who were best friends in college, who go on yearly reunions where they camp in the woods. This time they have chosen to camp out in an area where a demented family of hillbilly rednecks are living. Mother is the head of this strange family. She is living with her two backwoods sons and schooling them in the art and specialty of attacking and rapeing and killing of young women. This whole premise sounds totally sick and demented, and it is....as only the Troma team can present it. You have to see this movie to believe how incredibly over-the-top it is. The performances are excellent, especially the two sons.  They are both adults, but behave like children due to their backwards upbringing. All that these boys want to do is make their Mother proud and be the best killers possible. The chemistry and interaction between Mother and her two sons makes for fun viewing.  Even the three girls who eventually get kidnapped give credible performances. A lot of the female victims in horror movies are disposable characters that you really don't care if they get killed off or not, but there's enough character development here that you'll find yourself caring about the girls in Mother's Day. The final climactic showdown scene between the girls and the sons is exciting and memorable, mostly for the creative use of weapons. The only cheesy part of that scene was when one of the girls was shown holding a television set over her head as a murder weapon. You'll have to suspend your disbelief on that one. I guess tv sets were really light way back then (i'm being sarcastic!).The dvd extras include commercials for other Troma films, a few comedy skits about Troma that are so-so, and other stuff about Troma Studios. The best extra has to be the director's commentary because it is one of the best i've heard for a grade B horror movie since the commentary for The Evil Dead. I learned so much trivia and interesting info on the making of Mother's Day from the commentary. Fans of the movie will love the commentary! This movie has elements of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Last House On The Left, and i highly recommend this movie if you're a fan. Please keep in mind that Mother's Day is a dark comedy horror movie. It IS a horror movie, there's no denying that, BUT there are enough elements of twisted dark comedy to it involving the personalities of the two sons and their interaction with each other that it reminds us we're not watching a totally serious horror movie such as The Exorcist. Mother's Day is not for everyone, and many of the reviewers here on Amazon have said it's the worst film they have ever seen, blah blah blah. Anyone who says that is not a true fan of Troma films because they obviously don't understand the genre. You'll need to watch more than one Troma film to understand that statement. Just watch the trailers for the other films on this dvd and you'll know what i mean. This movie is excellent and i'm glad to see the dvd is the director's cut with all the violence and gore that was cut from the theatrical print lovingly put back in.

Suffice it to say I wasn't disappointed. Eli Roth confirms that this is his favorite horror film and I can't say that I disagree with him. The film opens with a uncomfortable situation involving a seemingly kindly elderly mother giving a lift in her vehicle to a pair of teenagers who don't seem to have innocent intentions. However, this is only the beginning and by the time the credits roll the viewer is left with a completely backward opinion then when it began,

  In brief, the film follows three woman who have been friends since college on an annual getaway and unfortunately find themselves in way over their heads despite their world weariness. The depth of depravity that the film stoops to isn't for everyone, but if you're in the mood to be thoroughly disgusted then this just might be the one for you.",1518307200,,984,4.64367816091954
7826634,4,6302485053,"It's not very often that we get to see a B-Class horror movie get a re-release on Blu-Ray. This classic was released by 88 Films as part of their ""Slasher Collection"", it's number 2 out of 10.

Mother's Day is about 3 women who used to be college dorm roomies and they decide to have a reunion and go camping. Unaware, in the Garden State (NJ) backwoods lives a mother and her two backwood hick deranged sons. They must now fight for their survival against these lunatic killers.

Watching the movie first time through, it may not feel like a great movie, but it does have a lot of redeeming qualities to the film. The mother does a fantastic job and seems to really hold the whole picture together to give you that sense of something is wrong with these people. The two actors who play her sons also do a great job and can make you cringe with certain scenes.

The movie was pretty much damned for it's content, as it does involve a rape scene and men abusing women. But what I think redeems this movie as a classic is that it was a different idea in slasher films for it's time. The victims are working together to get through the madness, the killers give you the bad vibes, the creepy atmosphere with creepy music and it's all about 3 helpless women and their survival. It may feel dated, but remember it's from the 1980's, which was the era of horror movies! Kaufman had created a horror treasure with this film.

88 Films did a great job transferring this classic to a 1080p Blu-Ray format, even though it's a PAL release (which those of us who live in the USA, this version will play on our Blu-Ray players). Adding many bonus features including an interview with Eli Roth, a bunch of different trailers, behind the scenes footage, commentary and much more. This version of the film is currently the ""ultimate release"".

I did also get to see the remake of Mother's Day, starring Jamie King and I love that movie just as much as the original. Which the remake had more suspense and ""Oh Crap!"" Moments, there's just something about the original that you can't forget.

All in all, I'm glad the original has finally started to pickup with followers, it was a long time coming and desevers the attention as many had missed out on this gem due to it being censored.  This is an obscure classic that should be in any horror fans collection!",1512604800,,2342,4.457943925233645
