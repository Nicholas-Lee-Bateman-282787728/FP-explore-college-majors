1092294,5,6305892865,"This is a family movie in the most wonderful sense.  So often, people use that phrase to mean ""no swearing"" or ""no nudity"", but so many ""family"" movies are just watered down nothingness, no story, no interesting characters...
This movie has spirit and heart.  Lucas Black is an amazing young man, a wonderful young actor who carries the entire movie all by himself.  After his grandmother's death, Conner (Black) decides to embark on a journey from Georgia to New York to meet his father's ship as it returns to port.  He confronts danger and many of life's challenges along the way.
What I especially like about the movie is that it doesn't tiptoe around some hard issues.  Conner deals with his grandmother's death all alone...he confronts an abusive adult with heart and bravery.  I think this movie is wonderful because it shows a nice, good, brave kid who isn't unreal the way so many kids are in movies and on TV today.  He's polite and smart and respectful and still super cool.  Way to go Disney and Lucas Black.",976924800,13,1020,4.659217877094972

1092577,5,6305892865,"This good old...original Disney movie is one of my favorite horse movies and now a favorite horse movie of our sons.  (our son, Rowdy is 7)

This is a film that captures the heart, spirit and bravery of a young boy and his horse/friend...""FLASH"".
Connor (the boy...played by: Lucas Black), is left at home with his  grandma, who later passes away.  Connor shows his bravery by selling his horse/best friend...""Flash"", to the horse ranch of a wealthy/selfish man and father of a boy he rode horses with. He became their stable boy so that he could be around Flash and help take care of him.
After finding out that the man was going to sell or try and do something horrible to Flash, he steals him and takes him away...to free him.
He then travels on a long, amazing journey...on Flash...to New York, to meet his father; who returns to port.  What a brave kid.  During his rough travels, there was happy and sad times...and he meets some very nice and helpful people.  These people he met became inspired by Connor and what he was trying to do.  I know my son was very inspired after watching this movie! He loved it and named one of our horses after it!
This film shows great family values...and touches the hearts of children and adults.
In the end, Connor is happily reunited with his father and his horse.  After Connor arrives back in their hometown...there was a big celebration and Welcome home to Connor and his horse Flash.
I would recommend this movie to all ages.  Great gift!",1221436800,,1485,4.548872180451128

1092579,5,6305892865,"As Quoted by: ""ann_septimus16""
""Well, that is not how horses work. 2-year-old horses are little more than kindergarteners... they cannot be ridden, they cannot event (jump) because they usually aren't even trained yet, and they cannot be ridden every day without serious consequences. Yes, the accuracy was not the point of the flick, but it still Seriously detracts from any worth to be found in the rest of the shmaltzy movie.""

Is she seriuos? Does she have any idea what work it takes to get a horse to the point of riding? I began working with my filly daily at just a few months old, by the age of 2 she was easily saddle broke. Had I waited till she was 2 I would have had a harder time and that is fact.

FLASH is an excellent movie for any age. I would allow any child in my care to watch and as a responsible adult, I know when to say no to a child on a whem of getting any animal. They are time consuming and if you do not have the time for caring, love and training, don't get the animal.
Lucas Black is a very good actor and a bonus to the movie.

By the way, 101 Dalmations was an excellent movie too. No, I did not get my son a Dalmation because he loved the movie.",1191456000,2,1180,4.121739130434783

What I love about this movie is the young man's resilience, determination and his ability to form a relationship with all he encountered.  I love that he was humble enough to ask for help and brave enough to stand by his beliefs - and never falter.  I am twice this young man's age and his perception of life and how to live it puts my own perception to shame.

It's a real sweet story with the classic Disney trademark on it, I'd say any horse crazy kid will love it. One little side note to the person who went off about this movie...yes kids may clamor for a horse, but most parents are smart enough to realize a horse costs way more than a dog. Also, by the age of two many thoroughbred horses are not only trained, but running strenuous races.",1070668800,3,603,4.345132743362832

I now have a 2 year old daughter and I would totally let her watch this movie.  We own and operate Rivermont Farm in Georgia, and I've always been really picky about how well a horse movie is done.  I really thought Simon Wincer did a great job with Flash as he ALWAYS does with his movies. Simon directed movies such as Operation Dumbo Drop, Phar Lap, The Man From Snowy River, Free Willy, Blue Grass, and some other wonderful animal movies.  Everyone I have ever met who has seen Flash loves this movie, and they are always so excited to hear I did the riding.  It was a wonderful experience.

Connor is a young man to respect for his courage, sense of right and wit. He is a young man to be respected.

Well, if you want to talk about those feelings, I suggest you try something that teens like to call chat rooms.
  Sorry, I got a little side tracked. for everyone who wants to know what this movie is really about, well, it's about a boy and his horse. It is a very heartwarming movie and is very inspiring to all horse and pony lovers to never give up on their dreams because horses are companions for life.

Remember how after ""101 Dalmatians"" all those dogs got snapped up by parents trying to appease their kids' obsession for spotty puppies?  Well, most of those got donated back to humane societies.  After watching Disney's lastest travesty, I am sure that thousands of those equine-insane girls and boys (yes, I was and still am one, too) will be begging for pretty horseys.  ""Look Mom, HE can keep him, and he even lives in the city and is Really poor!""
Well, that is not how horses work.  2-year-old horses are little more than kindergarteners... they cannot be ridden, they cannot event (jump) because they usually aren't even trained yet, and they cannot be ridden every day without serious consequences.  Yes, the accuracy was not the point of the flick, but it still Seriously detracts from any worth to be found in the rest of the shmaltzy movie.
The story isn't that great, either.  Believe me, you've seen this before... TOO many times.  All the characters are stereotypes and you can do better than to feed your impressionable kids those images of the cruel rich man who just uses his wealth for his own ends and feels the need to brutalize everyone else because he has the $$$.  Those sentiments smell faintly of Socialism, and the last thing the US needs is that.  The only saving grace is the acting of Lucas Black who plays Conor.  He actually can act, and he is a very good rider.

1092756,5,6305892865,"FLASH is a very good Original ""Wonderful World of Disney"" film. It captures the heart and spirit of a young teenage boy and his beloved horse, obviously by the name of Flash. Actually, in the beginning of the film, Flash doesn't belong to Connor (Lucas Black), he's owned by some neighbors of his near his father's farm. When the neighbors have to sell Flash, Connor instantly jumps up and wants his father to buy the horse. At first, his father doesn't want to spend a lot of money on buying a horse. But of course, he does end up buying the horse for Connor. Anyway, when Connor's father goes away on a trip somewhere (I forget where he goes on the trip and why because I haven't seen the movie in a while), and leaves Connor alone with his grandmother and Flash. Suddenly, Connor's grandmother dies - and leaves Connor all alone with his horse! His father hasn't even come back yet! Connor then takes Flash to this wealthy farm to sell him for money and ends up working for the wealthy family at their stable to help pay for his family's house and everything. Then, the family wants to sell Flash and Connor doesn't want them to sell Flash because he's afraid he'll never see Flash again. So he ends up stealing Flash and running off together on a long journey to find his father while riding horse-back on Flash all the way! The cast is excellent and especially Lucas Black - he is a very talented young actor and should be recognized more (check him out in a recent flick called ALL THE PRETTY HORSES, also starring the ultra talents of Matt Damon and Henry Thomas...you know, the little boy from Steven Speilberg's ET?).
