8584652,5,B00CPRH70M,"I have studied, taught and practiced (as a legislative committee director) the ideas presented here so clearly by Professor Kobylka.  At this price, considering this content, the package is a real deal.  Buying this Great Course direct could cost about $264 (today) and $100 if you wait to catch a sale.  Amazon is THE PLACE to buy this item and others like it.  Professor Kobylka is a charismatic presenter and a potent clarifier of the major concepts underlying our nation's government.  A key divide in American political thought is the 'community/mass' base versus 'individual' base for governmental action.  The course 'unpacks' the theocratic government of the New England Colonies...and it is as 'bible-based' and 'congregation-oriented' as today's Islamic theocracies!  Just understanding how Church-based governments and laws work to form individuals into communities is a big step forward in our understanding of events in our own time.  Moving on the to 'The Founding Fathers', we discover a diversity of opinion about how a national government ought to work and we discover why it was shaped the way it has been.  Again there is a basic divide:  'small-state' Liberalism versus 'Big State Liberalism.  'Liberalism' is understood in the historical context of being centered on the 'Rights' of individual white males.  Small-state Liberals advocate limited national government functions, keeping power closer to home.  Big State Liberals were more inclined toward stronger national government, a national banking system and a national defense.  Since today's 'Conservatives' still speak of State's Rights and Limited National Government' their roots are in 'small state Liberal thinking.  If you can 'get your head around' this distinction, you are 'good to go' for the rest of the course.

What follows traces original roots of who were 'individuals' and what 'Rights' did they have through Jeffersonian, Jacksonian, Lincoln/Civil War/Reconstruction, Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Regan (etc) periods in our national life.  Time and again, new generations have had to step up to support core values or push one way or another to 'tweak' governmental principals and policy to meet new needs.  Often individual Rights have been denied, given and taken away by one group or another in the name of one school of political thought or another. Professor Kobylka shows how these ideas matter and why we need, each one of us, to understand and to protect them.  This material is not overly 'technical' or theoretical and many viewers will remember a good few examples from high school or from having lived through them.",1479600000,,2636,5.338983050847458
