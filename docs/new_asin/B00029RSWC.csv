8024811,4,B00029RSWC,"The Gruesome Twosome- This was the first Herschell Gordon Lewis I've ever seen! What I loved about this is that it has the classic look of the 1960's and was extremely gory for a movie made in that time period. The thing I found very annoying was the old lady always talking to her dead stuffed cat! Her and her son have a wig shop and the wigs are made from women's real hair, because the son scalps the women and kills them in gory ways. I think this movie should be remade. I'd probably recommend THE GRUESOME TWOSOME!!!

A Taste of Blood- I found this movie to be incredibly boring, and slow. A businessman named John Stone receives a package in the mail from London. It's two old large bottles of brandy filled with vampire blood. Everytime he drinks it, he slowly transforms into a vampire. I would not recommend A TASTE OF BLOOD!!!

Something Weird- This movie is so awful, that it's actually funny. It's like a crazy acid trip. A man named Cronin Mitchell becomes horribly disfigured, and gains psychic powers. He soon meets a witch who will make him handsome if he becomes her lover. Everybody else in the world sees the witch as a pretty woman named Ellen. Mitchell is asked by the police to help stop a killer in the streets. If you love bad movies, and killer bed sheets, you'll love SOMETHING WEIRD!!!

She Devils on Wheels- This movie is crazy bad, and has laughable dialog. It was basically plotless. I thought Honey Pot was adorable. A gang of women called The Man Eaters ride their motorcycles, race each other, and have wild parties at their clubhouse afterward. Soon, a rival gang of men led by Joe-Boy come in on their territory. If you love Grindhouse style films, you might like SHE DEVILS ON WHEELS!!!

The Wizard of Gore- Montag the Magnificent is a master of illusion that picks women out of the audience and appears to stick swords in their mouths, puts drills through them, and other disgustingly awesome stuff. After, they seem to be okay, but when they get home, they die the same way Montag impaled them. I love how this had a Grindhouse feel and the blood and gore looked extremely fake, but was pretty cool anyway! If you love cheap gore gags from the 70's you'll love THE WIZARD OF GORE!!!

The Gore Gore Girls- I loved all the gore scenes, even though they looked incredibly fake. It had some unintentionally funny moments. A reporter named Nancy Weston hires an obnoxious private investigator named Abraham Gentry to investigate the murders of strippers and asks questions and then some radical feminist group break in, trying to stop the women from stripping. He goes to the strip club and asks questions. Later, he gets the idea to trap the killer by making Nancy pose as a stripper to catch the killer. Again, I loved all the gore and was better than other Herschell Gordon Lewis films. I highly recommend THE GORE GORE GIRLS!!!",1282348800,,2866,4.578947368421052
8024812,5,B00029RSWC,"Herschell Gordon Lewis has been a lot of things in his life, English Professor, Direct Mail Marketing Guru, Aspiring Rent-a-Car Tycoon...and Genius. He didn't just find an interesting niche and exploit it with his gore epics, he created a new kind of film, an unapologetic, brutal, silly kind of film that I, as a writer of surreal pulp horror look up to. These are movies that explode onto the screen, bombarding you with camp and challenging your notions of quality and good taste. While She-Devils on Wheels is not the exploitation masterwork, I hoped it would be, all these other movies are fun and intriguing in their own way. The Gruesome Twosome more or less shows us how Nancy Drew would react to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, A Taste for Blood is actually a pretty smart, though campy and weird vampire movie with a great nudie cutie short subject as a special feature on the disc, Gore Gore Girls is a gory, shocking and tastelessly funny work of brilliance and Wizard of Gore has kills that must be seen to be believed. So, check out these glimpses into the warped mind of a man that changed movies forever.",1268870400,,1117,4.646464646464646
8024813,5,B00029RSWC,"This package of the rest of Herschell Gordon Lewis's (horror) collection has some of his best films included.  To get all of the Lewis horror movies you would also want to purchase the ""Blood Trilogy"" the first 3 films of his ""horror"" career.

These later films show more gore effects in front of the camera (while very crude to today's standards) and the stories are a little better than the earliest films.  The acting (if you want to call it that) is about as stiff as you can get but that really makes these movies such campy fun.

The true horror movies in this pack include the following:
The Gore Gore Girls
A Taste of Blood (not really all that gory but it's about vampires)
The Gruesome Twosome
The Wizard of Gore

The other two films are more hippie/biker movies that were popular in the late 60's:
She Devils on Wheels (no devils just women that are bikers that act tough)
Something Weird (a hippie drug movie)

The best effects are in The Wizard of Gore and The Gore Gore Girls, again they are primitive in execution but this is what inspired all of the films to follow in the years to come.

The quality on the DVD's are first rate (as good as you can get from poorly produced films of the late 60's/early 70's) and the extras on the discs are fantastic.  Every one of the DVD's contain audio tracks of Herschell talking with his producer David Friedman and telling stories about each of these ""classics.""  Even if you hate the movies, these stories are truly entertaining and worth the price of the box alone.

If you want to take a trip back to where gore and truly low budget film making got it's start this would be the place.",1264723200,,1643,4.410596026490066
8024814,5,B00029RSWC,"If you've watched the movie Juno, you probably remember one scene that shows an excerpt from an old horror movie, The Wizard of Gore.  As a fan of such movies, this had piqued my interest, so I eventually picked up a box of three movies by Wizard's director, H. Gordon Lewis.  The movies (his ""Blood Trilogy"" of Blood Feast, 2000 Maniacs and Color Me Blood Red) were schlocky but fun, motivating me to pick up a second collection which, among other movies, includes Wizard of Gore.  This set is the H. Gordon Lewis collection.

H. Gordon Lewis directed and produced movies from the 1960s into the early `70s.  All independently made on shoestring budgets, they hardly have the look of studio fare.  In addition, Lewis knew that to make money, he'd have to cross certain boundaries of ""good taste"", at first with sex, then with violence.  It was great stuff for teens and young adults.  By the time of the movies in this set, Lewis had really carved his own little niche:  he knew he was not making classics, but he also knew he was bringing in the audiences.

The first film in this set is Gruesome Twosome, a comic movie about an old lady who runs a wig shop with her demented son (she's not all there, herself).  She advertises a room for rent to attract young college girls, who too late find out that they are to be killed and scalped to provide new material.  I guess it's one of those things you learn about places to avoid, like those shops that offer ""special meat"" dishes.  Along with the movie is a short on wig making.

A Taste of Blood, by far Lewis's longest horror movie (at nearly two hours), is a reworking of the Dracula story, with an heir of the legendary vampire taking on his ancestor's traits.  To fully take on his dark powers, he must kill descendants of characters from the Stoker novel; fortunately, a Van Helsing descendant is catching on that there's a new Dracula about.  This disc also has an ""archival nudie"" silent short called Nighmare at Elm Manor.

Something Weird is, well something weird.  It's also the name of the video company putting out these DVDs.  The story has something to do with a man who is electrocuted and takes on psychic powers, though he was scarred in the process.  A witch restores his good looks in exchange for his being her lover.  There's also a serial killer about, which the psychic is asked to help track down.  This disc has three psychedelic short films.

She Devils on Wheels is not a gore movie (although there is one nasty killing), but rather a film about the Man-Eaters, a gang of female bikers.  There's not really a plot in this one as much of a series of episodes in their lives, as they race, have sex and raise havoc.  The short subject on this disc is Biker Beach Party.

Then there is the Wizard of Gore (as shown in Juno), the tale of a magician who really does saw women in half.  At least that's what is seems like; there seem to be two separate realities: what he sees and what his audiences see.  The women do walk off stage, but then die soon afterwards, just as in his tricks.  This is the only disc of the six without a short feature.

Finally, there's the Gore Gore Girls, Lewis's last venture into the world of horror (or more technically, gore movies).  He goes out with a bang, with not only over-the-top violence but plenty of topless women in this tale of a mysterious killer who's offing strippers.  Unlike all the no-names in the other Lewis movies, this one does have a small appearance by Henny Youngman.  The short subject is a disemboweling scene from Love Goddess of Blood Island.

All the films come with commentaries that are fun to listen to and make it clear that Lewis knew he was not making art.  And certainly, by many standards, these are bad films, filled with hammy acting and cheesy dialogue, but they fit in the special category of so-bad-they're-good.  Also, since Lewis was a pioneer in this field, these movies are historically interesting.  They won't appeal to everyone - probably not even most people - but for fans of low budget horror, this collection is a fun set.",1217116800,7,4083,4.513623978201635
8024815,3,B00029RSWC,"Nearly 40 years ago, I witnessed one of these cinematic bloodbaths, as the bottom half of an otherwise forgettable drive-in theater double feature. ""Fiend"" memories of THE GRUESOME TWOSOME remain with me to this day (oh well!), like the old lady asking her son to get some liver for their taxidermist-stuffed cat. Let's just say that kitty was served VERY fresh meat that night.

The originator of ""slasher films,"" Herschell GOREdon Lewis, was truly one of a kind. His shocking schlock set the standard in this self-created genre during a nine-year run that began with 1963's BLOOD FEAST and ended with this collection's THE GORE GORE GIRLS.

8024816,5,B00029RSWC,"In 1963 Herschell Gordon Lewis, an independent filmmaker known for making limited release ""cutie"" pictures, changed forever the face of American cinema when he released ""Blood Feast."" This film, as low budget as you could possibly get, ushered in the era of the gore film. While it would be quite some time before Hollywood caught on to the fact that certain segments of the movie going public hungered for films containing nauseating scenes of explicit violence, H.G. Lewis took one look at the receipts for ""Blood Feast"" and decided he better quickly make another movie similar to this one. What followed was a series of gruesome zero budget shockers, films like ""The Wizard of Gore,"" ""A Taste of Blood,"" ""2000 Maniacs,"" ""Color Me Blood Red,"" and ""The Gruesome Twosome."" Lewis lensed the downright offensive ""The Gore-Gore Girls"" before retiring from the film business in 1972 in order to devote his time to the advertising industry. It wasn't until 2002 that the director returned to form with ""Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat,"" a movie which proved beyond a doubt that the Godfather of Gore still has what it takes to gross out an audience. It's elevates the soul to see something as audacious as a ""Herschell Gordon Lewis Collection"" hit stores. They even threw in a couple of Hersch's non-gore flicks for good measure.
I just can't get over a Lewis boxed set. First up is Lewis's ghastliest film, ""The Gore-Gore Girls,"" a movie so repulsive that one must see it to believe it. What's the plot, you ask? What are you, somebody who needs a coherent plot? Well, there is a plot here if you look hard enough. Some nut's been going around dispatching the female employees at the local ""men's clubs,"" so a newspaper hires crack detective Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress) to investigate the crimes. A ditzy local reporter, Nancy Weston, tags along and generally gets in the way whenever see can. You won't care about the plot when the gore starts rolling in. Lewis gives us a scene where a gal bobs for French fries, a hot iron applied to something other than clothing, and the grisly capper involving two types of milk. A head scene that rivals the atrocity we saw in ""Toxic Avenger"" makes an appearance, in case you were wondering. Whew! If you get through this movie intact, give yourself a pat on the back! Heck, if you can get through the cheesy canned jazz soundtrack, you'll be a winner in life. Look for Henny Youngman playing sleazy club owner Marzdone Mobilie, as well as Ray Sager from ""The Wizard of Gore"" hamming it up as a sniffling bartender.
Speaking of ""The Wizard of Gore,"" this cinematic nightmare shows up in the set as well. Montag the Magician (Ray Sager) puts on a heck of show when he hypnotizes his audience and then proceeds to massacre a volunteer from the crowd in stomach churning close up. The tricks include a sword swallowing bit, a punch press, and the old railroad spike through the head gag that's so popular at kiddie birthday parties. No one sees what Montag is up to-they're hypnotized, remember-until the victim falls to pieces after the show. A suspicious feminist talk show host eventually catches on to the wizard's foul deeds and, with the help of her boyfriend, attempts to bring the malevolent magician to justice. The conclusion of the film is memorable only because it actually makes the viewer think, a rarity in the world of Herschell Gordon Lewis films. ""The Wizard of Gore"" is probably my favorite Lewis gore film, so it's nice to see it again here. The acting is as wooden as it could possibly get, the effects are dirt cheap, and there are more continuity errors than you can shake a stick at, but it's all done in good fun. You'll love it. Really!
""A Taste of Blood"" and ""The Gruesome Twosome"" represent lesser H.G. Lewis productions (!). The former is the director's take on the vampire genre, as a chipper business chap named John Stone receives two mysterious bottles of wine from a recently deceased relative. Turns out that the stuff is blood from a vampire, which means by the time Stone finishes off the bottles, he becomes a walking Dracula. His wife Helen knows something is wrong, but can do little to stop the unfolding disaster. Not much gore in this one, but it is one of Lewis's better works in terms of cinematography and even (gasp) acting. ""The Gruesome Twosome"" also boasts a good actress in the form of Mrs. Pringle, a chirpy dame who runs a wig shop out of her house. Local college girls go there to buy hairpieces but never leave thanks to Pringle's demented son Rodney, a goofy looking miscreant who supplies mother with the raw material to make new wigs (think about it for a second and you'll get the idea). I got a kick out of the film, especially the cheesy dance number and Pringle's pet, the ever silent Napoleon.
""Something Weird"" and ""She-Devils on Wheels,"" I hate to say, constitute two entries in Lewis's non-gore canon. Both movies attempted to cash in on popular themes during their respective times. ""Something Weird"" came out when movies dealing with psychedelic themes were all the rage, and ""She Devils on Wheels"" emerged because of the biker film craze. Sorry, Hersch, but I can't abide these two atrocities. It's disappointing to see them here. The omission of ""Blood Feast"" and ""2000 Maniacs"" from this box set is a big, BIG problem. They should have tossed out ""Something Weird"" and ""She Devils"" and just made it a gore collection. Still, I'll take what I can get, and a Lewis boxed set is a delicious dream. Here's to hoping another one emerges in the future.",1089072000,29,5548,4.6971252566735116
