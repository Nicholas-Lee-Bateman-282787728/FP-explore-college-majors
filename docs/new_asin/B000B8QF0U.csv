2408978,5,B000B8QF0U,"I have the BBC Shakespeare complete and what can one say, other than it's superb! Word for word as written by WS, not edited, THE best actors in the known world - what more can one want?  To read reviews like the previous, where he is NOT reviewing the product and production, but; rather, reviewing the VENDOR of the discs inflames my ire.

One can not go wrong viewing the BBC production of Shakespeare's works.",1263772800,13,413,4.493333333333333
8083649,4,B000B8QF0U,"Enjoyed 4 of the 5 in this set but Antony and Cleapatra does not make the grade. It gets a one star. There has not been a less enjoyable portrayal of the infamous Egyption queen than this irritating effort. Jane Lapotaire, known for playing high strung characters, goes into orbit in this one. Really obnoxious. No attempt at authenticity. Much too old to be  playing the teenage queen. Hard to imagine Mark Antony getting worked up over her.",1507420800,,442,4.666666666666667

8083652,5,B000B8QF0U,Excellent.  We are watching while reading through the play - wonderful reading and performance!,1429228800,,95,5.785714285714286

8083654,5,B000B8QF0U,"The plays are superbly produced, true to the original scripts, and pleasingly done. Not extravagantly gaudy as a Hollywood production would be, but closer to how they would be produced back when Shakespeare first put them before the public. Must haves for those who love the Bard!",1354752000,4,280,4.9787234042553195
8083655,5,B000B8QF0U,I would recommend turning on the English subtitles while watching each DVD to improve comprehension.  Each DVD is about 2 hours in length.  Hamlet is much longer.,1324944000,8,162,4.962962962962963
8083656,4,B000B8QF0U,"This is my fourth group of five Shakespeare plays from the BBC series.  As before, the performances are excellent, the casting outstanding; the British have an inexhaustible supply of competent or better Shakespearean actors.  And, as in all volumes from this series, these DVDs have the tremendous advantage of having the text appear as subtitles (you can turn them off if you so desire), which are of great help in understanding the dialog.  The one reservation about this particular selection of plays is that only King Lear is among the Bard's greater plays, and two of them (Timon of Athens and Titus Andronicus) are among the most depressing things ever written.  Still, it is good to be able to watch even those.  I would like to see more of the plays become available in this five-volume format.",1323302400,10,803,4.8321167883211675
8083657,3,B000B8QF0U,"The DVD's are generally ok, although the video and sound quality is not the best (unless you're viewing them on a <12"" screen or your smartphone!). You can tweak the sound running the signal through an amplifier, so it's not a really big deal. However, sometimes they look more like 3rd generation copies. On several DVD's, if you use the subtitles, they are sometimes WAY, WAY out of synch with the actual spoken/viewed dialogue. This makes for a really nice memory game, but that's not what I purchased and not what Ambrose purports to sell! Fie on thee, Ambrose!",1309824000,7,565,4.717171717171717
8083658,5,B000B8QF0U,"The box came with a slight wear on corners, even though I bought it as new. The two of the DVD I watched out of this set so far played well and were in good condition. Excellent production!",1265846400,,189,4.0
