8055724,1,B0008ENHXU,"it dose not worth its price. Nothing will make you intersting to continue watching it instade of that, the bad quality picture will push you to stop the story.",1136160000,3,159,4.517241379310345
8055725,4,B0008ENHXU,"As a dull hetro male, I squirmed when The Woman requested this movie via NetFlix. French female leads? Almost all male characters depicted as heartless slugs? No car chases or ""Monster's Ball"" grade nudity?
  But by golly, I liked this tale.  Despite high school pageant level acting by those other than the three (perfectly casted) leads. Thankfully its sub-titled, not dubbed, which really gets my goat. The campers' hazing and isolating of Clara & Sonia is a reminder of how many teens waste half of their youth in stupid imbroglios. One word of warning: the same ghastly four or five cords of guitar are played when scrolling thru each section of the menu. The male lead, playing Zoe's boyfriend, just happens to be the Director's son. Well, graft is everywhere.
  I'll admit this film's writing is jejune (look it up) and provincial, but you can spare 90 mins away from your ipod, xbox or internet porn to watch it. Other reviewers need to lighten up...This little flick was made for what would amount
to no more than the coffee and soda budget of an American flick.",1129248000,24,1071,4.736559139784946
8055726,1,B0008ENHXU,"This movie went by so slowly.  The story sort of led you around in circles, the acting was poor and the characters weren't believable.....and the ending....what ending?!  I would not recommend this movie to anyone interested in the genre.  I was disappointed.",1128556800,12,259,5.119047619047619
