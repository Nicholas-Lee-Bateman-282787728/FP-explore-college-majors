8051257,4,B0007TKGK8,"While there are better shows from the 50's on DVD, ""Meet Corliss Archer"" is still a delightful and charming little sitcom. This DVD features 4 episodes, and the picture and sound quality is quite good for an unrestored short-lived 50's sitcom. If you like this show I'd also recommend ""Life with Elizabeth"" and ""The Eve Arden Show"", also released on DVD by Alpha Video, who admittedly don't do much to restore stuff, But must be given credit for releasing these rare old TV shows on DVD.",1215993600,2,487,4.674418604651163
8051258,4,B0007TKGK8,"""Meet Corliss Archer"" is certainly no television classic, but rather it's a reminder of the wholesome and gentle family comedies that were broadcast during the 1950s and 1960s.  The series ran for 39 episodes during the 1954-55 season, and that relatively short run means that it probably will not be seen on broadcast or cable television anytime soon.  Fortunately, Alpha Video has released this second volume containing four episodes to join volume one, which also contained four episodes, so owners of these DVDs can create their own mini-marathon of Corliss Archer episodes.

Ann Baker is a delight as Corliss, but it's John Eldredge (as Corliss' father Harry) and Bobby Ellis (as Corliss' boyfriend Dexter) who provide most of the laughs.  The prints used for this release aren't restored, but they're watchable and the audio is fine for a 50 year old series.

""Meet Corliss Archer"" is recommended to fans of vintage television comedies, as well as to those who prefer an alternative to the cynicism and vulgarities found in many of today's ""family"" sitcoms.  I have a slight preference for the episode selections in volume one, so my rating for volume two is actually closer to *** & 1/2.",1119225600,9,1194,4.974874371859296
