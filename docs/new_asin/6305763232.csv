7893991,4,6305763232,Pretty good movie. Jet li and his brothers learn shaolin and right across the bridge these females learn wu tang sword style. The father and uncle want to marry the daughters but don't have enough money for them so some bad guys come and set them up so they are forced out. Then the bad guys try to steal the women and money for themselves.,1394150400,,340,4.246153846153846

However, I was very dissapointed to find that the copy I purchased is in Cantonese. The dvd is pretty much worthless to me now.",1253491200,2,262,4.479166666666667

7893996,4,6305763232,"This is another one I remember watching on the big screen.  Once again, it's been dubbed into Cantonese (from Mandarin), but they didn't do a very complete job of it, so sometimes a line or two will pop out in Mandarin,  which can be entertaining in itself, if you understand the language.  Plot-  and character-wise, this movie is the best!  All the actors (pint-size and  regular-size) do a wonderful job of showing how much fun childhood can be.  The kiddie fight scenes are laugh-out-loud hilarious.  Jet Li was perfectly  cast as a kid caught between childhood and manhood, and he showcases his  talents with great fight scenes as well as with tender moments between his  character and his brothers and between his character and Hwang Chou Yin's.  Filmed on location, this movie also showcases some of the best of China's  spectacular scenery.  Great entertainment for all ages!",954979200,12,883,4.918367346938775
7893997,5,6305763232,"Excellent movie.  If you are a martial arts fan, you will love this.  My nieces(ages 7 to 17) loved this movie because the kids in the movie were cute and great actors.  Great Jet Li fighting scenes.  I could watch this  movie over and over.",951350400,8,241,4.266666666666667
