8445133,5,B0000DEYVA,"Many of the Reedswain videos were created in the early 2000's and when you look on soccer fields today you will see the successful teams use Reedswain practice drills or have modified versions. Im still learning that you cannot read one book or watch one video and be complete as a coach. This is a great video to learn how to develop the beginning stages for 6,7,8 and 9 year olds (being soccer is beginning as such a young age and the small sided games are used to create more touches). The video creates a variety of drills that are excellent to use or modify for excellent team success! GREAT VIDEO FOR THE PRICE!!!",1342137600,,619,4.43859649122807
