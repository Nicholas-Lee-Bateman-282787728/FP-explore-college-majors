3117950,3,B0013LRKYO,"I think it's awesome that this film is about the passage of the ADA.  However, that's only one detail; the majority of the movie is about the protagonist's failure to keep a romantic relationship.  Is that all that gets Hollywood's attention?  At least they're acknowledging a part of history that America would rather forget, but I'd like to see more of that.",1424822400,,360,4.774193548387097

3117957,5,B0013LRKYO,"I love this movie. Everyone should watch this to see how far we have come in our attitudes towards people with disabilities, especially from the atrocious 'Ugly Laws' that were enacted across the USA.  It is funny, heartwarming, informative, you will never be the same,...in a good way.

3117963,5,B0013LRKYO,"I absolutely love this movie. It is just so well done. Michael Sheen is such a phenomenal and versatile actor. I do believe he maybe the best in the Sheen family in my opinion. I was not aware about the disabilities as it was before my time. And wow...All I can say is I think everyone should watch this movie at least once.. Amazing, Funny and Heartwarming!!",1403481600,,359,4.373134328358209

3117965,5,B0013LRKYO,I really didn't know a thing about this movie and what a great surprise it was.  It is based on a true experience of a Viet Nam vet who was wounded during his service via an explosion that left him deaf. He is responsible for bringing an awareness to all people with disabilities and the changes in our society through legislation. His personal journey and the friendships forged is delightful and the dialogue is smart and funny.  I highly recommend this film and doubt you will be disappointed,1401408000,,495,4.613636363636363
3117966,5,B0013LRKYO,"I had to watch this movie for an Ethnic Studies class I was taking.  I was really impressed, and I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  It really helped me to understand what it's like to be on the other side of the handicapped situation.

3117967,5,B0013LRKYO,"Richard Pimentel is an important figure in civil rights history. The guy had a tough life that lead him to a tragic stint in Vietnam leaving Pimentel hearing impaired. His life changes in about 1971 when he meets Art who has cerebral palsy and is wheel chair bound. One evening Pimentel takes Art out for pancakes on his birthday, but the restaurant refuses to serve Art due to his unattractive condition. Rather than leave, the two stay willing to go to jail. The two go on a venture to help handicap get jobs and then help write and pass the most important civil rights legislation since the 60s, The American Disabilities Act that finally becomes law in the late 80s. A wonderful tribute to two men who have improved the lives of so many who were so in need of access, a job, and and a helpful hand up.",1398988800,,805,4.409395973154362
3117968,3,B0013LRKYO,"With a few missteps.  The first half takes you on a random, visually diverse adventure through a university, Vietnam, a hospital, then the university again.  Then it sort of settles into a slightly predictable groove of making it's arguments with exclamation points like a tv movie of the week would.  I cannot help but feel the romance, friendship, and organization for the disabled were brought to life in a somewhat stale and cliche fashion.  Everything just sort of falls into place in a straight line instead of the unique zig zags of the first half.",1395619200,,555,4.810526315789474
3117969,1,B0013LRKYO,"It could have been a good movie, but  the language and the sex scenes could have been left out.  I was so disgusted it with I toss it before it was half over.  I had saw the previews and thought it would be good.  I was really disappointed that Hollywood ruins a good story by throwing all the trashy things in to a movies.",1393977600,,323,4.0
3117970,5,B0013LRKYO,Very informative and well acted. Really tells a true story of the problems people with dissabilities faced in the 70's and 80's. Loved it!,1391558400,,138,4.791666666666667
3117971,5,B0013LRKYO,"We had recently met Richard Pimental and spoken with him, and seeing the movie of his life was great. He had a hard life, but went above and beyond to make a difference in the world, something most of us don't ever do. The movie is well worth watching, it not only gives a glimpse into his fascinating life, but gives a little about a piece of American history with the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). I highly recommend this movie!",1391299200,,454,4.416666666666667

I am so fortunate I found this Michael Sheen movie. It would have been great if it was fiction.  I laughed out loud. I cried. There aren't many movies that send me googling the characters and back story the minute the credits roll. How have I missed this amazing story of Richard Pimentel and Art Honeymen?? I think I'll hit youtube, TED talks, read a bit more and watch it again. I was so caught up in the characters that I need to watch again and realize how these two friends changed America.",1388880000,,929,5.496503496503497
3117974,5,B0013LRKYO,"A great movie about the man who was the biggest contributor to today's ADA; Americans with Disabilities Act. It starts right here with the change in attitude towards people with different abilities.

Recommended? Absolutely",1388188800,,223,5.5588235294117645
3117975,1,B0013LRKYO,"There was too much offensive language, after 30 minutes, I couldn't finish watching it.  In addition, there were scenes that were totally irrelevant.  Like in so many movies, the sexual content is so unnecessary and ruins otherwise decent story lines.  I would not recommend this movie.",1387756800,,286,5.173913043478261

3117979,2,B0013LRKYO,"Music Within starts off with a great story; the struggle of how one man over came his own disabilities and championed to rights of others.  The problem is the movie went every direction possible and spent very little time on Richard Pimentel's role in passing the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The relationship between Pimentel and Christine (Melissa George) was completely irrelevant to the story and yet, 80% of the movie focused on it.  It's difficult to connect with a character when we don't really understand what drives him (things are only hinted at, never fully developed).  This is an important story but not a great movie.",1376179200,,637,4.981132075471698

You can read the synopsis to find out what I'm talking about ... but I will say the product sold by Amazon was flawless and worked perfectly in my (ancient) DVD player.  Only thing I would have preferred is the product insert (ie pictures & artwork) ... but not sure what the insert would have added.

3117992,4,B0013LRKYO,"I may be speaking out of turn and if so, I apologize in advance.  I thought that this movie was very engrossing and thought-provoking.
My only gripe is that when I actually viewed the real Richard Pimentel delivering a speech, I noticed that he was a much larger individual than the character portrayed by Ron Livingston.  Now maybe the years of hard work, travel and making speeches have taken a toll on him and his girth (I can speak from personal experience that this does happen!), but if not, the director chose to portray Mr. Pimentel as a slimmer individual.  Take that one step further - why was Christine absolutely stunning - a very Heather Graham-like gorgeous blonde as portrayed by Melissa George, an Australian-American former model?  It makes for an unlikely pair if nothing else.
Did anyone else feel the same way? Here is a film that chooses to portray that the disabled be recognized in their own right, yet no ""fat"" or average-looking people were selected to play the roles of Richard and Christine.",1341187200,,1018,4.767045454545454

Another great film based on a true-story and the main characters interaction with each other is fascinating, especially as one of them is paraplegic - the more the film goes on the more us the viewer can understand perfectly what he says and means.  Some hilarious scenes too - amazing that this is only 30years ago in USA.",1332979200,,489,4.4222222222222225

3117995,4,B0013LRKYO,"It's risky business for a movie to feature a main character with a severe disability; no matter how perfectly coalesced all the necessary elements are for making a good movie, if the actor can't portray the essence of the disability, then the whole movie fails. The talent necessary for an actor to accurately capture the nuances, emotional context, and physicality of living with a severely handicapping condition has to be award-winning, or the actor, and the movie, become a tragic spoof.  So it seems outrageous and beyond risky that director Steven Sawalich would choose to make the movie Music Within, which features not one, but two main characters with disabilities.  Perhaps Sawalich was delusional.  (They make pills for that.) As for the two actors, Ron Livingston and Michael Sheen, and why they would choose this challenge, perhaps this quote provides an insight: ""Dysfunctional families have sired a number of pretty good actors."" -- Gene Hackman ([...]).  No matter the reason, though, or where the talent or reason comes from, like the heroes they portray, they accepted the challenge.

  Music Within is based on the true story of two men, Richard Pimentel (played by Ron Livingston) and Art Honeyman (played by Michael Sheen).  The two men, each with disabling conditions, befriended each other while trying to navigate the American culture, and soon found themselves at the leading edge of the civil rights movement, challenging the culture of discrimination toward people with disabilities. By accepting the challenge of activism and civil disobedience, Pimental a Vietnam vet who returned from the war with severe tinnitus and deafness, and Honeyman, a genius born with cerebral palsy, ""inspired the American with Disabilities Act"" (Artisan News Service, 2007).  This major legislation, signed in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush, addressed equal opportunities and accessibility issues in the workplace.  Tony Coelho, original congressional sponsor of the act, said, ""It's the first movie about the ADA movement"" (Graham, 2007).  It's an excellent movie, entertaining and educational, and produced with heart, soul, and inspiration.

3118000,3,B0013LRKYO,"""Music Within"" tells the true story of Richard Pimentel, a Vietnam vet who lost almost all of his hearing on the battlefield and who spent the rest of his life advocating for the rights of the disabled.  In fact, Pimentel was instrumental in getting the Americans With Disabilities Act passed into law.

Hampered by pedestrian direction by Steven Sawalich and a superficial script, the film, nevertheless, boasts enough humorously sardonic moments to keep it from taking itself too seriously.  The relationship between Richard and his longtime girlfriend Christine (played by Melissa George, who's a dead ringer for a young Sandy Dennis) is dealt with in trite and overly familiar terms, and the filmmaking itself never rises much above the level of disease-of-the-week, TV-movie competence.

Still, the performances are good - especially by Michael Sheen as Richard's best buddy, Art Honeyman, a genius with Cerebral Palsy - and the material itself so moving and inspiring that one can easily overlook the movie's numerous stylistic weaknesses.  And, besides, you get to see the late great Leslie Nielson in one of his last - and briefest - appearances as a forward-thinking doctor who changes Richard's life forever.",1299888000,,1218,5.257731958762887

3118005,4,B0013LRKYO,"I like Ron Livingston. He's got that all American boy kind of face and appeal. He isn't the greatest actor you'll ever see. I just haven't ever seen him dig that deep, but he has a decent screen presence. He also seems to have the knack (or maybe it's his agent) for picking lousy projects. I think Office Space and Band of Brothers were his only two projects of any real note. Anyway.......he does do a fine job here and he's in every scene so he really had to work to keep the character going.

As noted above, he plays Richard Pimentel who was instrumental in getting the Americans With Disabilities Act into the books. The movie takes him from his unfortunate childhood through his time in Viet Nam where he lost most of his hearing and on through the time where he found his ""voice"" in working to try to get disabled people jobs and beyond to his work with the government.

This is a well written, well acted movie and it is steady to the point you can set your watch to it. There is nothing fancy afoot and no razzle dazzle. This is just good old meat and potatoes film making. It's dotted with memorable characters, a nifty soundtrack and enough humor to not make everything seem too heavy. This is not an easy subject to handle and many of the pitfalls have been avoided. They also show Pimentel's weak side, so they don't try to make him out as a saint/savior (though one crucial scene had a picture of the crucifix in the background). He's as flawed as anyone.

This movie is so steady there might be a tendency to consider it ""cookie cutter"" filmmaking, but deft touches in the writing and characterizations help it rise above that. Plus it does give the viewer the background for what, at the time, was groundbreaking legislation, but what has since become second nature to most of us.

3118018,5,B0013LRKYO,"I've had the privilege of meeting Mr. Pimentel and hearing him tell his own story with great humor, energy, self-deprecation and panache.  They say that people are put into each others lives for a purpose.  Thus, Art and Richard were the spark that ignited the original Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, offering accommodations in public buildings and the workplace to those for whom opportunity had previously been abysmally absent.
  Over time, the Supreme Court and appointed EEOC regulators, emasculated the purpose of the act by too narrowly drawing the definition of disability. In many circumstances, merely taking prescribed medication, regardless of its effectiveness, would be sufficient mitigation to deny the existence of disability. Episodic or relapsing-remitting conditions (such as, seizure disorders or MS) would not be considered disabling because of their lack of constancy, despite their unpredictability. And those simply 'perceived' to have had some illness and then not hired, could not claim they were discriminated against.
  But, Richard Pimentel again returned to the drawing board and in September of this year, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 was signed into law. It goes into effect 1/1/09, clarifying the 'Broad' definition of Disabilities, the reassertion of rationality into the decision making process regarding mitigation, episodic conditions, body systems, activities of daily living and communication.  In essence, the intent of the ADA has been resurrected. And, hopefully for all the Richards and Arts of this country, those who seek the old fashioned 'outright intentional exclusion' will have had their last hurrah.",1225756800,,1662,5.597609561752988

How can any civilised society legislate an Ugly Law?

3118026,3,B0013LRKYO,"Music Within is a biopic revolving around Richard Pimentel, a wounded Vietnam vet whose efforts at finding jobs for fellow wounded vets along with his friendship with Art Honeyman, a writer with severe cerebral palsy, led to Richard's widespread workplace disability training and the eventual creation and adoption of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990.

However, despite solid performances by Ron Livingston as Richard, Melissa George as his love interest Christine, and Michael Sheen as Art, the film falls into predictable pitfalls. First, as a Vietnam-era biopic, with the vintage soundtrack and generic battlefield sequences, Music Within feels like it could have been pulled from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest-Gump-Two-Disc-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00003CXA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest Gump (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Born-on-the-Fourth-of-July-Special-Edition/dp/B0002V7ON8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Born on the Fourth of July (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;or any number of films revolving around Vietnam vets' painful readjustments to civilian life. Livingston is simply too old to pull off a convincing teenage Richard, and the scenes of Richard's early childhood are awkward and strike a sour note. The role of Christine, Richard's love interest, was one-dimensional and instantly forgettable (she appears when the script requires it, other than that she's off practicing ""free love"" with her other boyfriends).

As a ""disabled"" film, there are moments that reminded me strongly of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rory-O-Shea-Was-Here/dp/B00005JNV9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rory O'Shea Was Here</a>, an Irish indie film starring James McAvoy and Steven Robertson as wheelchair-bound rebels, one with muscular dystrophy and the other with severe cerebral palsy. Art's CP also brought to mind Daniel Day-Lewis's performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Left-Foot-Special-Edition/dp/B00008L3RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Left Foot (Special Edition)</a>, which also leads me to my next observation: despite comments from directors, surely there must be professional actors with actual cerebral palsy. Despite well-meaning portrayals, having able-bodied actors attempt to recreate the symptoms of CP, even if done well, always feels like a cheap shot to me, and at times Michael Sheen's performance borders on caricature. Also, despite a split-second scene of Richard's speech therapy class, the onscreen portrayal of lipreading is highly inaccurate.

The sloppy script lacks any real drama, and I agree with a reviewer who stated that the film would have been much more powerful if Art had been the narrator instead of Richard. The '70s is merely set dressing, and there is no sense of any real passage of time other than hairstyles. Despite the blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos from Rebecca De Mornay, Hector Elizondo, and Leslie Nielsen, the film came off feeling unpopulated, focusing on Richard's quest with little real depth or insight, despite the backstory of his seeking acceptance from his mentally ill mother. There are numerous continuity goofs in respect to period details, but the sound editing, distorted at times to reflect Richard's tinnitus, is effective.

Overall, Music Within still had its moments, particularly from the razor-sharp wit of Art's painfully delivered lines (which, per other films with CP characters, are mostly unintelligible). Much like the device used in Rory O'Shea, Richard serves as Art's mouthpiece when dealing with other people since he is the only (!) person who can understand him. There is a lot of heavy profanity, drinking, and drug use by the Vietnam vets and several scenes involving death, so if you're sensitive to any of these, consider yourself forewarned. The DVD also features deleted scenes (nothing special), a commentary, several trailers for other films, and a keynote speech from the real Richard Pimentel.",1210377600,,4134,6.443243243243243
3118027,2,B0013LRKYO,"First off, Ron Livingston (as Richard Pimentel) is excellent in a dramatic role having been in so many great comedies (Office Space). Michael Sheen is absolutely brilliant as a wheelchair confined sufferer of Cerebral Palsy. In my mind, they blew it not having more screen time for Sheen.

Short to be short: The first 10 minutes of this self narrated film were excellent. Richard's mother(Rebeca deMorney) has had miscarriage after miscarriage (7 in fact) until Richard is miraculously born. The best line in the whole film is here. Richard narrates ""I was born with my umbilical cord around my neck, and I have been pissed off ever since...""  Richard (as a child) comes home repeatedly to find his `unstable' mother celebrating all the birthdays of her unborn children(with repeated overdoses of sleeping pills as candles burn on their birthday cakes), and basically denying her surviving son. My beef here, is they could have done so much more with that scenario. But the scenes were moronically cut (probably due to fitting into Hollywood's stupid desire to keep films 90 minutes or less), and we have to watch the deleted scenes to get the filler that makes it all make sense. Anyway, Pimentel strives to be recognized through debating, and through public (high School) speaking. He excels to the point even the strippers he works for (working as a cook after high school) back him up by giving a client an `extra show' and supplying him with a new suit.

Pimentel gives a great tryout (looking for a scholarship) as a speaker. But the college professor interviewing him (Hector Alonzo) rejects him. While he feels Pimentel has skill, he blows him off as not having heart. Pimentel revolts by joining the Army and ends up losing his hearing to acute tinnitus in a direct shelling in Vietnam.

Yada yada...he meets CP Sheen on a campus. For some reason, Pimentel cannot hear anyone else clearly. He can understand Sheen's weird vocalizations. They become friends. The best parts of this film are the verbal play between Sheen and Livingston!

yada yada, Pimentel falls for Melissa George (a stereotyped 1960's free spirit), and suddenly, Sheen is left as character to be named later as that relationship develops. Pimentel champions the disabled. His drive to help his fellow vets who couldn't get work, is a direct reflection on his childhood dream to be a superhero. It is shown as a very worthwhile cause, when in fact it is truly narcissistic. This attitude destroys his relationship with Melissa George.

In true Hollywood fashion, he reaches an epiphany, that his life is not what he wanted it to be, and he changes. He goes back to confront Elonzo, who (stereotypically) admits he's on Lithium, and one of the disabled Pimentel is championing for. But they don't follow it up! Then Richard's mother dies, and his self truth is realized. His ego is reined in, and he comes to terms with his drive to succeed being directly connected to his mother refusing to acknowledge his life.

There is SO much great acting in ths flick. But the editing is totally crap. Every single `deleted' scene needed to be left in the film. Every one of the deleted scenes showed way more than the final product.

I applaud the message of the film. But there is denying (after the first GREAT 10 minutes)why it went straight to dvd rental. Great performances by Livingston, Sheen, and George were totally wasted. Sheen especially. He was almost totally discarded in the last 30 minutes, and he was the catalyst to the whole film.

Watch the deleted scenes. They make the film whole.

The editor needs to be shot.",1209340800,,3600,4.839024390243902
3118028,4,B0013LRKYO,"The life of the extraordinary survivor Richard Pimentel is a fine biography that manages to explore the many phases of a unique man's life with humor, tenderness, and bravado.  Though barely recognized in its theatrical release, MUSIC WITHIN should hopefully find a wide audience in the form of this well constructed DVD.  There are many significant lessons to be learned from this story (written by Bret McKinney, Mark Andrew Olsen  and Kelly Kennemeras) as well as a large dose of entertainment from some superb actors directed by Steven Sawalich (credited with the original idea for the film).

Richard Pimentel (Ron Livingston) entered the world as one of the survivors in a series of miscarriages by his mother (Rebecca De Mornay), a deeply disturbed woman who surrendered her only living child to a Catholic orphanage at birth.  From there Pimentel grew up with bizarre circumstances, raised by his Chinese father who dies from a working accident.  Desperately needing to belong and to recognized, Pimentel became an expert public speaker, but  his efforts to gain admission to college were thwarted by college speech professor Ben Padrow (Hector Elizondo) who admired Pimentel's technical abilities on the stage but says he needs to live life to find his 'music within' before he can succeed in college level oratory. Out of need for employment and guarantee for a college education Pimentel joins the military, is sent to Vietnam, where a blast of incoming explosions disables him with deafness.  Released from the military without the benefits of Veteran funds, Pimentel deals with his inability to hear, meets Art Honeyman (Michael Sheen)  disabled by cerebral palsy and the two strike up a warm friendship: the two can understand each other and form a bond stronger than the critical eye of the 'normal world'.  Pimentel meets the beautiful Christine (Melissa George) and soon they bed only to have Pimentel discover the Christine shares her bed with another man.  From this point the story picks up a pace that is breathless as Pimentel gains his education and a good job, only to join a group of disabled veterans, and eventually devote his life to fighting for the rights of the disabled.  And this is all true!

Livingston finds the right balance between dark humor and ambition to create change in a world that views the disabled as 'ugly',  and together with Michael Sheen's impeccable performance as the multifaceted cerebral palsy stricken Ken, the spot-on actors transcend the 'docudrama' genre and offer us unforgettable characters that provide a richly entertaining story as well as a plea for understanding the plight of the disabled.  The features included with the DVD are full of interviews with the real Richard Pimentel and the actors' and director's responses to the formation of the American Disabilities Act that resulted from this amazing young man's struggle to find his music within.  It is a wild ride of a comic film with a very tender message.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, April 08",1208131200,,3023,5.072727272727272
3118029,4,B0013LRKYO,"Richard Pimentel knows what it is to be unwanted.  That's the way life started with his mother (Rebecca De Mornay) whose multiple miscarriages led her into suicidal grief for each one's passing.  So absorbed is she in her loss, she has little left to give to her only living son.  (The narrative is crisp through the movie, as he observes that his mother was ""...not successful at suicide, but she was punctual."")  His father is a Chinese restauranteur, who provides some stability in the boy's life until he passes away from a work-related accident.  Then, mom changes custody for him from her to relatives and back to her again.

Richard becomes eloquent in spite of it all.  He develops his speech skills enough to win trophies, but not enough to win a scholarship from Portland (WA) University.  Dr. Pedro gives him a try out, but his conviction doesn't match his delivery.

His solution is to join the Army where he volunteers and becomes an enlistee for the Vietnam War.  One night while celebrating and reverie with his fellow soldiers, a shell pierces the night sky, but they aren't able to evacuate in time.  The blast leaves Richard injured, especially with hearing loss.  One of the masterstrokes of the movie is how they relate the muffled sounds of speech and the perpetual ringing in the ears he experiences and is expected to live with for the rest of his life.

Coming home, he has disability support, but he needs so much more.  He comes across a counselor who gives no support or consolation about job opportunities, but his anger and determination keep him going.  Like nearly everyone else, he'd like to relate to others and be a productive and working member of society.

The people he meets from there are essential.  Fellow Vet Mike Stoltz (Yul Vzquez), suffering from an amputated leg, offers him a beer at 10:00 in the morning, but he proves to be a better companion than beer for breakfast.  At a cafeteria, Richard meets a patron, Art Honeyman (Michael Sheen), who has cerebral palsy.  Shooting from the hip with a few choice expletives, Art has a style and conviction Richard likes better than the professor did his own.  Together they're inseparable.  One day while roller skating (Art's in a roller chair) they inadvertently knock over Christine who is understandably flustered, but he finds his match with her steady live-in boyfriend who has the looks, but not the congeniality toward his handicapped friend.

Most of the movie shows Richard's struggle--within himself, against institutions, and winning Christine's affection.  With friends and determination as his chief resources, he is able to lobby support for handicapped people in groundbreaking ways. Although based on a true story, I was surprised to find so many means one man, who used his eloquence and handicaps to provide those ""...little differences you make in someone's life.""  Both personal and historical in impact, 'Music Within' should be music to every movie goer's ears.",1207699200,,2974,4.937625754527163
3118030,5,B0013LRKYO,"This movie was a surprise for me. Movies dealing with the ADA or IDEA or 504 are often dry and dull. They want to express the somber times people with disabilities were struggling through, which is commendable, but makes for dry cinema. Music Within is funny, witty, sarcastically vulgar. It made me laugh out loud.

For a person who works with people with disabilities, I have experienced first-hand how humor can get you through the tough times. Sometimes you need to just laugh! Laugh at yourself, your situation, the irony, and everything you can't control. This movie embodies that sentiment!

This movie should be required viewing. It brings about a troubling topic in such a stark, wonderful, charming way! Pimentel's CP friend is an incredible supporting character as well. Do yourself a favor- if you want to combine a great chuckle and enlightenment on the former (or not so former) plight of the disabled- check this out!",1207699200,,932,4.929936305732484

It is a shame that every theatre in the country didn't show this amazing movie which showcases the creation of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act).  This is a must see.  I really enjoyed the special features but of course since we heard Mr. Pimentel speak, we heard much more of the speech that is featured on the DVD.  It is a shame they didn't show the speech in its entirety because his story is truly inspiring.  I wish the movie were longer because when it's over, you don't want it to be finished but it's worth viewing.  Check it out.",1207699200,,724,4.431818181818182

My only gripe is that when I actually viewed the real Richard Pimentel delivering a speech, I noticed that he was a much larger individual than the character portrayed by Ron Livingston.  Now maybe the years of hard work, travel and making speeches have taken a toll on him and his girth (I can speak from personal experience that this does happen!), but if not, the director chose to portray Mr. Pimentel as a slimmer individual.  Take that one step further - why was Christine absolutely stunning - a very Heather Graham-like gorgeous blonde as portrayed by Melissa George, an Australian-American former model?  It makes for an unlikely pair if nothing else.
Did anyone else feel the same way? Here is a film that chooses to portray that the disabled be recognized in their own right, yet no ""fat"" or average-looking people were selected to play the roles of Richard and Christine.",1341187200,,1018,4.767045454545454

3352492,4,B0013LRKYO,"It's risky business for a movie to feature a main character with a severe disability; no matter how perfectly coalesced all the necessary elements are for making a good movie, if the actor can't portray the essence of the disability, then the whole movie fails. The talent necessary for an actor to accurately capture the nuances, emotional context, and physicality of living with a severely handicapping condition has to be award-winning, or the actor, and the movie, become a tragic spoof.  So it seems outrageous and beyond risky that director Steven Sawalich would choose to make the movie Music Within, which features not one, but two main characters with disabilities.  Perhaps Sawalich was delusional.  (They make pills for that.) As for the two actors, Ron Livingston and Michael Sheen, and why they would choose this challenge, perhaps this quote provides an insight: ""Dysfunctional families have sired a number of pretty good actors."" -- Gene Hackman ([...]).  No matter the reason, though, or where the talent or reason comes from, like the heroes they portray, they accepted the challenge.

  Music Within is based on the true story of two men, Richard Pimentel (played by Ron Livingston) and Art Honeyman (played by Michael Sheen).  The two men, each with disabling conditions, befriended each other while trying to navigate the American culture, and soon found themselves at the leading edge of the civil rights movement, challenging the culture of discrimination toward people with disabilities. By accepting the challenge of activism and civil disobedience, Pimental a Vietnam vet who returned from the war with severe tinnitus and deafness, and Honeyman, a genius born with cerebral palsy, ""inspired the American with Disabilities Act"" (Artisan News Service, 2007).  This major legislation, signed in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush, addressed equal opportunities and accessibility issues in the workplace.  Tony Coelho, original congressional sponsor of the act, said, ""It's the first movie about the ADA movement"" (Graham, 2007).  It's an excellent movie, entertaining and educational, and produced with heart, soul, and inspiration.

3352497,3,B0013LRKYO,"""Music Within"" tells the true story of Richard Pimentel, a Vietnam vet who lost almost all of his hearing on the battlefield and who spent the rest of his life advocating for the rights of the disabled.  In fact, Pimentel was instrumental in getting the Americans With Disabilities Act passed into law.

Hampered by pedestrian direction by Steven Sawalich and a superficial script, the film, nevertheless, boasts enough humorously sardonic moments to keep it from taking itself too seriously.  The relationship between Richard and his longtime girlfriend Christine (played by Melissa George, who's a dead ringer for a young Sandy Dennis) is dealt with in trite and overly familiar terms, and the filmmaking itself never rises much above the level of disease-of-the-week, TV-movie competence.

Still, the performances are good - especially by Michael Sheen as Richard's best buddy, Art Honeyman, a genius with Cerebral Palsy - and the material itself so moving and inspiring that one can easily overlook the movie's numerous stylistic weaknesses.  And, besides, you get to see the late great Leslie Nielson in one of his last - and briefest - appearances as a forward-thinking doctor who changes Richard's life forever.",1299888000,,1218,5.257731958762887

3352502,4,B0013LRKYO,"I like Ron Livingston. He's got that all American boy kind of face and appeal. He isn't the greatest actor you'll ever see. I just haven't ever seen him dig that deep, but he has a decent screen presence. He also seems to have the knack (or maybe it's his agent) for picking lousy projects. I think Office Space and Band of Brothers were his only two projects of any real note. Anyway.......he does do a fine job here and he's in every scene so he really had to work to keep the character going.

As noted above, he plays Richard Pimentel who was instrumental in getting the Americans With Disabilities Act into the books. The movie takes him from his unfortunate childhood through his time in Viet Nam where he lost most of his hearing and on through the time where he found his ""voice"" in working to try to get disabled people jobs and beyond to his work with the government.

This is a well written, well acted movie and it is steady to the point you can set your watch to it. There is nothing fancy afoot and no razzle dazzle. This is just good old meat and potatoes film making. It's dotted with memorable characters, a nifty soundtrack and enough humor to not make everything seem too heavy. This is not an easy subject to handle and many of the pitfalls have been avoided. They also show Pimentel's weak side, so they don't try to make him out as a saint/savior (though one crucial scene had a picture of the crucifix in the background). He's as flawed as anyone.

This movie is so steady there might be a tendency to consider it ""cookie cutter"" filmmaking, but deft touches in the writing and characterizations help it rise above that. Plus it does give the viewer the background for what, at the time, was groundbreaking legislation, but what has since become second nature to most of us.

You can help right that injustice by catching it on DVD - it's worth your time, most notably for Michael Sheen's brilliant performance as Art Honeyman, wracked physically by Cerebral Palsy, but brilliant and caustic in mind and spirit.

3352515,5,B0013LRKYO,"I've had the privilege of meeting Mr. Pimentel and hearing him tell his own story with great humor, energy, self-deprecation and panache.  They say that people are put into each others lives for a purpose.  Thus, Art and Richard were the spark that ignited the original Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, offering accommodations in public buildings and the workplace to those for whom opportunity had previously been abysmally absent.
  Over time, the Supreme Court and appointed EEOC regulators, emasculated the purpose of the act by too narrowly drawing the definition of disability. In many circumstances, merely taking prescribed medication, regardless of its effectiveness, would be sufficient mitigation to deny the existence of disability. Episodic or relapsing-remitting conditions (such as, seizure disorders or MS) would not be considered disabling because of their lack of constancy, despite their unpredictability. And those simply 'perceived' to have had some illness and then not hired, could not claim they were discriminated against.
  But, Richard Pimentel again returned to the drawing board and in September of this year, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 was signed into law. It goes into effect 1/1/09, clarifying the 'Broad' definition of Disabilities, the reassertion of rationality into the decision making process regarding mitigation, episodic conditions, body systems, activities of daily living and communication.  In essence, the intent of the ADA has been resurrected. And, hopefully for all the Richards and Arts of this country, those who seek the old fashioned 'outright intentional exclusion' will have had their last hurrah.",1225756800,,1662,5.597609561752988

How can any civilised society legislate an Ugly Law?

I loved Art's sense of humour, and the close friendship he developed with Richard. I thought Micheal Sheen played the character of Art very well, but I think it's about time that actors with cerebral palsy were chosen to play these roles.  It's a film everyone should see.

3352523,3,B0013LRKYO,"Music Within is a biopic revolving around Richard Pimentel, a wounded Vietnam vet whose efforts at finding jobs for fellow wounded vets along with his friendship with Art Honeyman, a writer with severe cerebral palsy, led to Richard's widespread workplace disability training and the eventual creation and adoption of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990.

However, despite solid performances by Ron Livingston as Richard, Melissa George as his love interest Christine, and Michael Sheen as Art, the film falls into predictable pitfalls. First, as a Vietnam-era biopic, with the vintage soundtrack and generic battlefield sequences, Music Within feels like it could have been pulled from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest-Gump-Two-Disc-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00003CXA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest Gump (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Born-on-the-Fourth-of-July-Special-Edition/dp/B0002V7ON8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Born on the Fourth of July (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;or any number of films revolving around Vietnam vets' painful readjustments to civilian life. Livingston is simply too old to pull off a convincing teenage Richard, and the scenes of Richard's early childhood are awkward and strike a sour note. The role of Christine, Richard's love interest, was one-dimensional and instantly forgettable (she appears when the script requires it, other than that she's off practicing ""free love"" with her other boyfriends).

As a ""disabled"" film, there are moments that reminded me strongly of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rory-O-Shea-Was-Here/dp/B00005JNV9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rory O'Shea Was Here</a>, an Irish indie film starring James McAvoy and Steven Robertson as wheelchair-bound rebels, one with muscular dystrophy and the other with severe cerebral palsy. Art's CP also brought to mind Daniel Day-Lewis's performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Left-Foot-Special-Edition/dp/B00008L3RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Left Foot (Special Edition)</a>, which also leads me to my next observation: despite comments from directors, surely there must be professional actors with actual cerebral palsy. Despite well-meaning portrayals, having able-bodied actors attempt to recreate the symptoms of CP, even if done well, always feels like a cheap shot to me, and at times Michael Sheen's performance borders on caricature. Also, despite a split-second scene of Richard's speech therapy class, the onscreen portrayal of lipreading is highly inaccurate.

The sloppy script lacks any real drama, and I agree with a reviewer who stated that the film would have been much more powerful if Art had been the narrator instead of Richard. The '70s is merely set dressing, and there is no sense of any real passage of time other than hairstyles. Despite the blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos from Rebecca De Mornay, Hector Elizondo, and Leslie Nielsen, the film came off feeling unpopulated, focusing on Richard's quest with little real depth or insight, despite the backstory of his seeking acceptance from his mentally ill mother. There are numerous continuity goofs in respect to period details, but the sound editing, distorted at times to reflect Richard's tinnitus, is effective.

Overall, Music Within still had its moments, particularly from the razor-sharp wit of Art's painfully delivered lines (which, per other films with CP characters, are mostly unintelligible). Much like the device used in Rory O'Shea, Richard serves as Art's mouthpiece when dealing with other people since he is the only (!) person who can understand him. There is a lot of heavy profanity, drinking, and drug use by the Vietnam vets and several scenes involving death, so if you're sensitive to any of these, consider yourself forewarned. The DVD also features deleted scenes (nothing special), a commentary, several trailers for other films, and a keynote speech from the real Richard Pimentel.",1210377600,,4134,6.443243243243243
3352524,2,B0013LRKYO,"First off, Ron Livingston (as Richard Pimentel) is excellent in a dramatic role having been in so many great comedies (Office Space). Michael Sheen is absolutely brilliant as a wheelchair confined sufferer of Cerebral Palsy. In my mind, they blew it not having more screen time for Sheen.

Short to be short: The first 10 minutes of this self narrated film were excellent. Richard's mother(Rebeca deMorney) has had miscarriage after miscarriage (7 in fact) until Richard is miraculously born. The best line in the whole film is here. Richard narrates ""I was born with my umbilical cord around my neck, and I have been pissed off ever since...""  Richard (as a child) comes home repeatedly to find his `unstable' mother celebrating all the birthdays of her unborn children(with repeated overdoses of sleeping pills as candles burn on their birthday cakes), and basically denying her surviving son. My beef here, is they could have done so much more with that scenario. But the scenes were moronically cut (probably due to fitting into Hollywood's stupid desire to keep films 90 minutes or less), and we have to watch the deleted scenes to get the filler that makes it all make sense. Anyway, Pimentel strives to be recognized through debating, and through public (high School) speaking. He excels to the point even the strippers he works for (working as a cook after high school) back him up by giving a client an `extra show' and supplying him with a new suit.

Pimentel gives a great tryout (looking for a scholarship) as a speaker. But the college professor interviewing him (Hector Alonzo) rejects him. While he feels Pimentel has skill, he blows him off as not having heart. Pimentel revolts by joining the Army and ends up losing his hearing to acute tinnitus in a direct shelling in Vietnam.

Yada yada...he meets CP Sheen on a campus. For some reason, Pimentel cannot hear anyone else clearly. He can understand Sheen's weird vocalizations. They become friends. The best parts of this film are the verbal play between Sheen and Livingston!

yada yada, Pimentel falls for Melissa George (a stereotyped 1960's free spirit), and suddenly, Sheen is left as character to be named later as that relationship develops. Pimentel champions the disabled. His drive to help his fellow vets who couldn't get work, is a direct reflection on his childhood dream to be a superhero. It is shown as a very worthwhile cause, when in fact it is truly narcissistic. This attitude destroys his relationship with Melissa George.

In true Hollywood fashion, he reaches an epiphany, that his life is not what he wanted it to be, and he changes. He goes back to confront Elonzo, who (stereotypically) admits he's on Lithium, and one of the disabled Pimentel is championing for. But they don't follow it up! Then Richard's mother dies, and his self truth is realized. His ego is reined in, and he comes to terms with his drive to succeed being directly connected to his mother refusing to acknowledge his life.

There is SO much great acting in ths flick. But the editing is totally crap. Every single `deleted' scene needed to be left in the film. Every one of the deleted scenes showed way more than the final product.

I applaud the message of the film. But there is denying (after the first GREAT 10 minutes)why it went straight to dvd rental. Great performances by Livingston, Sheen, and George were totally wasted. Sheen especially. He was almost totally discarded in the last 30 minutes, and he was the catalyst to the whole film.

Watch the deleted scenes. They make the film whole.

The editor needs to be shot.",1209340800,,3600,4.839024390243902
3352525,4,B0013LRKYO,"The life of the extraordinary survivor Richard Pimentel is a fine biography that manages to explore the many phases of a unique man's life with humor, tenderness, and bravado.  Though barely recognized in its theatrical release, MUSIC WITHIN should hopefully find a wide audience in the form of this well constructed DVD.  There are many significant lessons to be learned from this story (written by Bret McKinney, Mark Andrew Olsen  and Kelly Kennemeras) as well as a large dose of entertainment from some superb actors directed by Steven Sawalich (credited with the original idea for the film).

Richard Pimentel (Ron Livingston) entered the world as one of the survivors in a series of miscarriages by his mother (Rebecca De Mornay), a deeply disturbed woman who surrendered her only living child to a Catholic orphanage at birth.  From there Pimentel grew up with bizarre circumstances, raised by his Chinese father who dies from a working accident.  Desperately needing to belong and to recognized, Pimentel became an expert public speaker, but  his efforts to gain admission to college were thwarted by college speech professor Ben Padrow (Hector Elizondo) who admired Pimentel's technical abilities on the stage but says he needs to live life to find his 'music within' before he can succeed in college level oratory. Out of need for employment and guarantee for a college education Pimentel joins the military, is sent to Vietnam, where a blast of incoming explosions disables him with deafness.  Released from the military without the benefits of Veteran funds, Pimentel deals with his inability to hear, meets Art Honeyman (Michael Sheen)  disabled by cerebral palsy and the two strike up a warm friendship: the two can understand each other and form a bond stronger than the critical eye of the 'normal world'.  Pimentel meets the beautiful Christine (Melissa George) and soon they bed only to have Pimentel discover the Christine shares her bed with another man.  From this point the story picks up a pace that is breathless as Pimentel gains his education and a good job, only to join a group of disabled veterans, and eventually devote his life to fighting for the rights of the disabled.  And this is all true!

Livingston finds the right balance between dark humor and ambition to create change in a world that views the disabled as 'ugly',  and together with Michael Sheen's impeccable performance as the multifaceted cerebral palsy stricken Ken, the spot-on actors transcend the 'docudrama' genre and offer us unforgettable characters that provide a richly entertaining story as well as a plea for understanding the plight of the disabled.  The features included with the DVD are full of interviews with the real Richard Pimentel and the actors' and director's responses to the formation of the American Disabilities Act that resulted from this amazing young man's struggle to find his music within.  It is a wild ride of a comic film with a very tender message.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, April 08",1208131200,,3023,5.072727272727272
3352526,4,B0013LRKYO,"Richard Pimentel knows what it is to be unwanted.  That's the way life started with his mother (Rebecca De Mornay) whose multiple miscarriages led her into suicidal grief for each one's passing.  So absorbed is she in her loss, she has little left to give to her only living son.  (The narrative is crisp through the movie, as he observes that his mother was ""...not successful at suicide, but she was punctual."")  His father is a Chinese restauranteur, who provides some stability in the boy's life until he passes away from a work-related accident.  Then, mom changes custody for him from her to relatives and back to her again.

Richard becomes eloquent in spite of it all.  He develops his speech skills enough to win trophies, but not enough to win a scholarship from Portland (WA) University.  Dr. Pedro gives him a try out, but his conviction doesn't match his delivery.

His solution is to join the Army where he volunteers and becomes an enlistee for the Vietnam War.  One night while celebrating and reverie with his fellow soldiers, a shell pierces the night sky, but they aren't able to evacuate in time.  The blast leaves Richard injured, especially with hearing loss.  One of the masterstrokes of the movie is how they relate the muffled sounds of speech and the perpetual ringing in the ears he experiences and is expected to live with for the rest of his life.

Coming home, he has disability support, but he needs so much more.  He comes across a counselor who gives no support or consolation about job opportunities, but his anger and determination keep him going.  Like nearly everyone else, he'd like to relate to others and be a productive and working member of society.

The people he meets from there are essential.  Fellow Vet Mike Stoltz (Yul Vzquez), suffering from an amputated leg, offers him a beer at 10:00 in the morning, but he proves to be a better companion than beer for breakfast.  At a cafeteria, Richard meets a patron, Art Honeyman (Michael Sheen), who has cerebral palsy.  Shooting from the hip with a few choice expletives, Art has a style and conviction Richard likes better than the professor did his own.  Together they're inseparable.  One day while roller skating (Art's in a roller chair) they inadvertently knock over Christine who is understandably flustered, but he finds his match with her steady live-in boyfriend who has the looks, but not the congeniality toward his handicapped friend.

Most of the movie shows Richard's struggle--within himself, against institutions, and winning Christine's affection.  With friends and determination as his chief resources, he is able to lobby support for handicapped people in groundbreaking ways. Although based on a true story, I was surprised to find so many means one man, who used his eloquence and handicaps to provide those ""...little differences you make in someone's life.""  Both personal and historical in impact, 'Music Within' should be music to every movie goer's ears.",1207699200,,2974,4.937625754527163
3352527,5,B0013LRKYO,"This movie was a surprise for me. Movies dealing with the ADA or IDEA or 504 are often dry and dull. They want to express the somber times people with disabilities were struggling through, which is commendable, but makes for dry cinema. Music Within is funny, witty, sarcastically vulgar. It made me laugh out loud.

For a person who works with people with disabilities, I have experienced first-hand how humor can get you through the tough times. Sometimes you need to just laugh! Laugh at yourself, your situation, the irony, and everything you can't control. This movie embodies that sentiment!

This movie should be required viewing. It brings about a troubling topic in such a stark, wonderful, charming way! Pimentel's CP friend is an incredible supporting character as well. Do yourself a favor- if you want to combine a great chuckle and enlightenment on the former (or not so former) plight of the disabled- check this out!",1207699200,,932,4.929936305732484
3352528,5,B0013LRKYO,"This is a wonderful film.  We were actually fortunate enough to have Mr. Richard Pimentel come speak at our school this past Summer.  His story is amazing and worth the watch.  It is a shame that every theatre in the country didn't show this amazing movie which showcases the creation of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act).  This is a must see.  I really enjoyed the special features but of course since we heard Mr. Pimentel speak, we heard much more of the speech that is featured on the DVD.  It is a shame they didn't show the speech in its entirety because his story is truly inspiring.  I wish the movie were longer because when it's over, you don't want it to be finished but it's worth viewing.  Check it out.",1207699200,,724,4.431818181818182
