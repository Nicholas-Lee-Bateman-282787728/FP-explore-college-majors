3170088,5,B0017CW5U8,"What a great movie.  I for one couldn't stand the comedy styling of Steve Martin from his SNL days, but this was the first movie that I saw him do some serious acting in.  GREAT movie!  Thoroughly enjoyed it.",1265846400,5,208,4.282051282051282
3170089,5,B0017CW5U8,"When I was a kid, my favorite movie was ""The Music Man"". I must have seen it in the theater at least a dozen times. I loved the story of the con man who got caught in his own con and I experienced the same joy watching Steve Martin do his own version of Prof. Harold Hill (now Jonas Nightengale) in ""Leap of Faith.""

This movie was truly misunderstood by most critics who tried to compare it -unfavorably- with such films as ""Elmer Gantry"" or characterize it as a statement on televangelism. They also focused too heavily on the emotional, and therefore, ""unrealistic"" ending. Even worse, the studio mis-marketed the film, and you'll often find it in the comedy section of the video store. Warning: it is not a comedy. Yes, there are light moments- how can there not be with Steve Martin- but this film is much richer than a typical Steve Martin comedy.

Steve Martin's performance is superb and magical and should have been nominated for an Oscar. The film score is tremendous with some of the best gospel singers in the country providing the music- not to mention Meatloaf! Contrary to the critics, I found the ending mesmerizing- left open enough for interpretation, moving, and inspirational.

So, ignore most of the critics, approach it with an open mind, and be willing to listen to the message. ""I always think there's a band, kid,"" said Harold Hill in ""The Music Man""; ""Just because a person doesn't show up doesn't mean the person doesn't care about him,"" says Jonas Nightengale in ""Leap of Faith"". Enjoy!

In this newly-released edition, ""Leap of Faith"" is paired with another Martin movie, ""The Out of Towners.""  I haven't seen ""The Out of Towners"" yet, so I can't review it, but I would recommend you get this set just on the strength of ""Leap of Faith.""",1248480000,15,1766,4.647435897435898

3170134,5,B0017CW5U8,"Speaking as someone who's generally anti-religious, I found Leap Of Faith touching in a very spiritual way. It's a great performance by Steve Martin - I think one of his best - and a great picture of a life changing experience for several people. I've watched it three times and I am looking forward to a fourth - I keep finding more layers in it, the sign of a great work of art IMHO.",1381104000,,385,4.216216216216216

3170137,4,B0017CW5U8,Bought for girlfriend because she liked the movie plots and Steve Martin. Pretty good chick flicks at a reasonable price.,1375401600,,121,5.1
3170138,5,B0017CW5U8,Love Leap of Faith for some of the questions and reflections. Humorous look at how God might work even in the face of a sham.,1357344000,,125,4.04
3170139,5,B0017CW5U8,One of my favorite movies of all time!  Steve Martin does a great job in The Out of Towners and Leap of Faith was a surprise to me since I've never heard of it.  He was terrific!,1355875200,,178,3.7837837837837838
3170140,5,B0017CW5U8,I purchased this dvd because I love both of these movies. Leap of Faith is really my favorite.  Although it gives a bad representation of the church but a great love story and I love the gospel singing. Now i just need to buy the sound track for the Leap of Faith movie.,1330646400,,270,4.09433962264151
3170151,4,B0017CW5U8,Both of these movies have been around for a long time. We esp. like Leap of faith. It shows a lot of will power and soul searching thru out the movie!,1325462400,,150,3.870967741935484
3170152,2,B0017CW5U8,The movies here were not all that good.  I was disappointed in them both and I am a die-hard Steve Martin Fan.,1322697600,,110,4.0

3170157,4,B0017CW5U8,"These are both enjoyable films even though they are not indicative of Steve Martin's best comedy work. Leap of Faith has a hard time deciding whether to be a drama or a comedy, but does fairly well at both. However, a jack of all trades is seldom a master of one, and this movie proves that. The Out-of-Towners is also uneven, but has some great laughs.",1300147200,,353,4.363636363636363
3170158,5,B0017CW5U8,The DVD of Leap of Faith is one of Steve Martin's finest performances.  The reason for the purchase was to have the movie handy for repeat enjoyment.  That movie was worth purchasing the duel package.  Enjoy!,1289606400,2,208,4.722222222222222
