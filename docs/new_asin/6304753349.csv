918169,3,6304753349,you have to love black and white films. most have good plots....much better than todays hogwash...stupid plots based on sex or violence. This one was designed to be a life lesson,1392768000,,178,4.774193548387097
918170,3,6304753349,"Give it 15-20 min at the beginning before you quit.

This movie shows what life was like during the baby scoop era (look it up). Very sad that Drew did not step up and let Sally know that he would have loved her and her son.

Now there is an adoptee that is separated forever from its mother. What a shame.

Straight up, who  thought that Drew's leg was going to fall off, or at least swing around backwards?",1375660800,,408,4.1265822784810124
918171,1,6304753349,I didn't finish the movie. I got lost about 15  minutes in....because I was so bored. The plot sounded good but it was definitely lacking when I actually started watching it.,1362441600,,174,4.612903225806452
918172,5,6304753349,"Wow!  While the filming and sound quality left a lot to be desired, the story, the depth of the characters, and the redeeming nature of this movie brought me to tears.  Every young girl should watch this movie and realize that the 'bad boys' just aren't worth the time and trouble.  BTW, Leo Penn (Sean Penn's father, no less) was excellent in this role.  I really believed he was playing that piano; those eyes were full of fire and sadness.

It was curious to me how 'unwanted' pregnancies were handled back then.  It left me wondering if the government funded those hospitals.  Somehow I doubt it.

As for particulars, I loved the line, ""If you have a headache, baby, don't share it with the world!""  All around great acting and totally worth the time spent.  Thanks Amazon, for putting this on Prime.  I totally enjoyed it!

EDIT:  My 18 yo daughter just watched this with me and she loved it too.  And she's pretty hard to please in the romance movie department.  :-)",1360972800,2,972,4.53757225433526
918173,4,6304753349,Movies Were Better Than I Was Expecting --- Get It Expecting ---- Oh Well --- They Could Of Left Out The Birthin  Stuff ---- Both Movies Are Worth Watchin ----But The Wrong Rut Is The Best One ----,1357171200,,197,4.184210526315789
918174,5,6304753349,"I have watched two of the 'Ida Lupino movies' (ones she directed)and I could have a shelf full if they were available. She really gets to the heart of the matter. I always wish there was a bit more just to see more of what she put together. I really enjoy the cast. they seem to work well together from what it seems coming across the screen. The movies hold the 'necessaries' for the subjects being presented. (the one on polio/ disabilities and again here with an unexpected pregnancy.) I appreciate the way 'shame' is approached and the people brought in with such compassion. Showing a true-to-life approach at the 'delicate/difficult' subjects. And timeless lessons.
  The films might not hold the interest of younger children, yet they are done with a taste that anyone could be in the room watching or overhearing. (Yes, the always present cigarette and touches of 'drink' are there, yet the cigarette thing was not realized for far too long.) At one part, the cigarette seemed to portray the stepping stones in the lives of the Sally Forrest characters. Speaking of which, the two main actors are really good. As I stated before, they blend together. They showed quite a bit of the baby's father, a bit more of his feelings and also the girl's attempt to interest him in making 'things permanent' without either of them knowing her situation. No manipulation on her part. Just trusting. An all-too-familiar story done so well here. Along with the portrayal of not-so-perfect homelife. That part in itself ought to get folks thinking - how parents might act and react differently.  Good threads all thru the movie and some the viewer is left to 'write' on their own. ""Food for thought"", so to say!
  I did sorta think that maybe the long stairway scene at end of ""Unwed Mother"" would have been difficult for the handicap 'Drew', that maybe he could have been going up the last one and fallen, and then Sally would have had to 'bend pride' a bit to 'return' to him and then assist Drew. Meet 'halfways' so to say, to show an action of compassion to match his, I guess is a good way to explain what I am trying to say here. [just an extra touch that 'speaks louder than words'] and Miss Lupino's movies have that all thru them. She's great and the movies are, also!",1348012800,,2270,4.608910891089109
918175,4,6304753349,"I wrote three pages to a friend of mine, dealing with only the first 5 minutes of this movie. I won't do it here, besides English is not my mother tongue, but telling this may give you an impression how touching this film is for me. The rest ist also brillant, not only highly emotional, but courageous, intelligently staged and acted, highly symbolical (the WOUNDED veteran, e.g., may also be sexually ""wounded"", and at the end you do not know who rescues whom), and it reveals much of the social-cultural circumstances and women's position in post-war USA.",1234569600,9,558,4.762886597938144
918176,5,6304753349,"I love this movie. I had planned to purchase it awhile ago and I am glad to finally have it and share it. I recently discovered that Ida Lupino was more than a good actress-she was a daring and insightful movie maker! She dared to tackle ""invisible "" subjects-those stories that no one liked to talk about;but that we knew existed. She told these stories with honesty and compassion. Imagine how hard it was for a woman to make it behind the camera in Hollywood in those days-and then add the fact of the controversial material Lupino chose to use! She was amazing and remains a fine example for young women everywhere!",1229385600,16,619,4.535714285714286
918177,5,6304753349,"Watch ""Not Wanted"" not only to experience a damn good movie, but to learn how early 20th century filmmaker Ida Lupino (yes, Lupino actually directed this classic)creatively and affectively handles poverty, infatuation and Abortion as it affects one misguided young woman. This film dives into the psyche of a disturbed woman, one not quite past the point of no return, and illustrates how sincere devotion helps restore her sanity. Its a good buy and a wonderful watch.",1226361600,11,469,5.103896103896104
918178,4,6304753349,"Sally Forrest stars as Sally, a nineteen year old girl who gets involved with pianist Leo Penn, falls hard for him, even following him to another town to be with him.  He's not interested, so she takes up with a boyish war veteran, played earnestly by Keefe Brasselle.  When she discovers she is pregnant by Penn, her life is turned upside down again.  The storyline is presented straightforwardly, something that surprised me given that the film was made in 1949.  Actress Ida Lupino directed most of the film, although she is not credited, and in some ways, it matches the tough character she so often played on screen.  The film presents the girl's plight with heart, but doesn't really get sentimental.  It's starkly photographed, with elements of silent film incorporated, as long passages of time in the film are viewed without words and using montages instead.  The actors are good, the story simple, and apart from an excessively melodramatic conclusion, it's a tight little film worth a look by today's audiences, especially those interested in the development of film.  It's a chance to see a film from pretty much the only female director of her time, presenting a story from the point of view of a woman.",1000598400,7,1216,4.840579710144928
7876549,1,6304753349,"Very bad quality movie. A logo is permanently appearing at the bottom of the picture. It seems like a bad recording from tv. So that I didn't watch the movie. I read the critics about this film which seem to be good, but really this awful quality does not make me want to watch it. Pitty.
Mme si le film semble avoir de bonnes critiques, la qualit&eacute; ex&eacute;crable du DVD ne donne  pas envie de le regarder. Le film n'est pas restaur&eacute; et pire il y a un logo sur le ct&eacute; droit en bas de l'image, un peu comme si celui-ci avait &eacute;t&eacute; enregistr&eacute; &agrave; la t&eacute;l&eacute;vision.

7876558,5,6304753349,"This movie is obviously dated, with the heroine going to a ""home for unwed mothers"" to have her baby. But for an older movie, I thought the acting was well-done and not heavy-handed as it so often was in movies from this era (although Sally's mother was a little over the top!). I was also pleasantly surprised at the compassion shown to Sally by everyone who helped her along the way after she got pregnant. Her boyfriend's initial reaction when he found out she was pregnant by someone else was understandable, but I was happy to see that it looked like they were going to have a chance together late. Give it a watch if you enjoy movies of this genre. You won't be disappointed.",1398297600,,681,4.456
