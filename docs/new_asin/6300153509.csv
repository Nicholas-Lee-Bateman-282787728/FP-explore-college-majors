I remember getting this tape when I was a kid (and I still have it) and being a bit bored by that one. The scene where Kimber gets kidnapped and left inside an active volcano was the best part, and it was hilarious when the Misfits were savoring a meal but became ill when they were informed they were eating shark! But I find sports to be pretty dull, and a lot of this episode is about sports.

Now, the second episode is truly one of the best in the series, in my opinion, and why ultimately I love this tape. Jem and the Holograms are on a cruise and the Misfits show up to stir up mischief. They all end up falling into the ocean and are subsequently stranded on an island together, their clothes torn to rags and with only first aid kit between the two bands. They call a temporary truce as they have to forage for their own food, build campfires, and escape dangerous wildlife!

One of the best of the Jem cartoon's many great features is the fantastic cast, and here the acting is taken to new heights. I have seen cast interviews where they discussed Jetta's voice actress ripping out her own hair to get the right tone for her character to be in pain. Well, in this episode I think Roxy's voice actress must have literally been talking with her mouth full in the scene where the Misfits are eating on board the ship! Even as a kid I was impressed by her.

The songs in this episode are some of the series' best, too, and you get to see a different variety of fashions because in Hot Time in Hawaii they're playing competitive sports and in Island of Deception they're at a fancy cruise dinner and then in ripped clothing, running around barefoot on the island.

Jem has really stood the test of time. The show is just as entertaining to an adult as to a kid, and the songs never get old.",1468454400,,1907,4.2164383561643834
