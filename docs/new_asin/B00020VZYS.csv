While the workout is good, it takes some will power just to make it through an enjoyable Pilates routine because of the monotony of the instructor and the lack of creativity within the overall presentation.",1355184000,2,312,4.7592592592592595
8020035,5,B00020VZYS,"Before this video, I have never done Pilates.  This DVD is great for getting your abs back post baby.  It has 2 programs that are fairly short - 16 minutes or 13 minutes.  These are great if you don't have much down time with newborn.  Or you can do both of them together for a 30 minute workout.  Great instruction.  It isn't very Exciting, but it has good exercises.  I have really enjoyed doing it each morning.  I have seen a difference in my stomach since starting it.  It was recommended by my Chiropractor and it has some great back exercises in it.

Don't let the cover fool you, it is not to perform with your baby.",1350172800,4,624,4.256410256410256
8020036,4,B00020VZYS,"I have recently began taking a Reformer Pilates and a mat Pilates class at the Y.  I wanted something to supplement at home since my kids don't like to go into childcare every day.  Having two young kids under the age of 4, this seems to be a good starter video.  There are 3 gals on the mat (one doing an easier modified version) and a woman instructing who is walking around them providing direction.  She is pretty bland but she gives good direction regarding what we should be doing during each exercise to get the best results.  The workout is 31 minutes long.  There is also the option of a 47 minutes workout that includes the matwork (31minute) and 16 minutes of exercise with the pilates ring. There isn't any music in the background so the workout is very different than say, a yoga video, where you become almost spiritually moved by the experience.  I still enjoy it, but this is my first pilates video so I don't know what else is available.  The direction and exercises are very much in line with what I am learning with my instructors at the gym.",1251849600,4,1061,4.43298969072165
