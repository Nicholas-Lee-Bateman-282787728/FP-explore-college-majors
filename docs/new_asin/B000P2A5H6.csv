Chris Nebe, the guy who made this, is from a famous family.  One of his family member Arthur Nebe attempted to assassinate Hitler and failed.  I recommend this to everyone who has even a passing interest in WWII and the origins of the Nazi regime.

8188456,5,B000P2A5H6,"The 2nd part of this DVD, ""Massacres Under the Rising Sun"", appears to be mainly excerpts from a color war movie about Japan's wars against China and Russia. Does anyone know the name of this movie? It was very well done, a truly horrifying portrayal of the insanity of war.",1225843200,,274,4.5
