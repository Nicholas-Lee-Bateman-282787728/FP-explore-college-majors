7765524,5,B01GRU5CQS,"""The Conjuring 2"" is great. This is how the story goes: Lorraine and Ed Warren travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirits.

The cast led by Patrick Wilson (as Ed) & Vera Farmiga (as Lorraine) is great. The directing by James Wan (who also produced and co-wrote the story & screenplay) is great. The story by Wan, Chad & Carey Hayes and the screenplay by Wan, Chad & Carey Hayes and David Leslie Johnson is great.

The music by Joseph Bishara (who makes an appearance as a Demon) is great. The cinematography by Don Burgess is great. The film editing by Kirk Morri is great. The casting by Anne McCarthy, Kellie Roy & Rose Wicksteed is great. The production design by Julie Berghoff is great. The art direction by A. Todd Holland & Andrew Rothschild is great. The set decoration by Liz Griffiths & Sophie Neudorfer, set dressings by Daniel Ainslie, Don Cinderella, Katie Gauvin & Andre Rivera is great. The costume design by Kristin M. Burke is great. The make-up effects by Eleanor Sabaduquia is great. The special effects supervised by Matt Kutcher & Chris Reynolds is great. The visual effects supervised by Colin Strause & Ariel Velasco-Shaw is great. The stunts coordinated by Joel Kramer & John Rottger is great.

This is a great horror movie sequel that is entertaining, scary and well-done. This is just as great as the first ""Conjuring"". Patrick Wilson & Vera Farmiga are solid again as usual as Ed & Lorraine. James Wan has directed another great movie (horror or otherwise). This is one of the best movies of the summer, so far and also one of the better sequels (in general) of the year, as well, too.",1465689600,,1684,4.644295302013423
7765525,5,B01GRU5CQS,"The Conjuring 2 delivers on a number of levels. Its terrifying  inflicting the audience with numerous horrific scenes. While the horror is ramped up it never resorts to being cheesy or gratuitous. The original unfolds more like the traditional tale of the supernatural haunted house, while the sequel is poignant in the way it zeros in closely into the family. The characters at the heart of the horror become much more than merely the victims who the Warrens seek to save from evil entities. The family and their neighbours prove themselves to be strong characters and are portrayed to be every bit as interesting as the Warrens.

The sometimes slow pace of the movie heightens the impending dread and emotional intensity of the familys plight. The Conjuring 2 is more complex than the original with more twists and turns. Despite a larger cast of interested onlookers coupled with greater publicity of this haunting, ultimately the family are left more helpless when an unrelenting sceptic finally undermines their credibility. The sequel is a compassionate story that doesnt simply play to scare. Even though the victims are terrified and helpless against a devious and powerful entity, they are brave and resilient.
The setting is very prosaic and urban reflecting 1970s London, and it blends supernatural and family drama seamlessly. The main plot focuses on the haunted house, the subplot is more personal and zeros in on Lorraines vulnerability and courage brought on by her powerful psychic ability. Ultimately, the two narrative strands stories converge dramatically to bring the film to its climax.",1465603200,,1608,5.180769230769231
7765526,5,B01GRU5CQS,"The Good:
Get used to it, but I'm going to be telling you often that director James Wan (Saw, Insidious, The Conjuring) is an absolute MASTER of horror. Just like in The Conjuring, he teases you with the stereotypical horror tactics that we've all seen in other horror films. Then he throws you a bunch of curve balls so you'll never really know what to expect. To make things even scarier, he even has the characters in the movie do what you or I would probably do in their situations. For example, if you saw a ghost, you'd probably run, right? I know I would.

If you allow me to nerd out a bit, I have to bring your attention to some of the unique camera angles that are used in the film. With the many horror films I've seen, I've never seen the ones he used in one of the ""interview sessions"", for example. (You'll know which one I'm referring to when you see it)

I would like to think that I'm one of those who don't scare easy, but this movie had me cowering in my seat the entire time. It was simply so intense and suspenseful that I had to check my heart rate a few times. (I'm pretty sure I died twice)

If you're a fan of James Wan's other work, then you may also catch on to the fact that there are a lot of similar themes that the movies share. The rules in his ""horror universe"" are almost the same.
I think overall, the characters all delivered. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga continue to share great on screen chemistry.  As for the ghost in the film....it was scary. Matter of fact, I'm still in the process of trying to forget it, so that's all I'll say about it. :-/

The Bad:
This is 100% me simply nitpicking, but I was a little disappointed by the final moments of the movie. I've seen a ton of exorcism movies, and I thought that the final wrap up was a tad bit rushed.

The Reason:
If you liked Insidious 1 or 2, or the Conjuring (review), then youll enjoy this. I think its fair to say that this will probably be the best horror film for the year. Did I already mention that James Wan is the MASTER of horror? Honestly, I just don't think there's much of a comparison for another director in this decade.

Just like in one of my previous horror reviews, I do want to clarify the difference between ""scary"" and ""Creepy"". ""Scary"" means that it will have moments that shock you with jump scares. ""Creepy"" is all about the overall feeling and atmosphere that sticks with you well after the movie is over. Many horror films today simply don't find a nice balance between the two, or they just pile on a bunch of blood and gore to overwhelm you.
James Wan, in my opinion, transcended even himself by blending creepy and scary even more than before. I think that the Conjuring 2 is more than worth the watch and is a ""Must See""in my book. Ill tell you this, Im not going to London, I don't like nuns anymore, and I will never buy my children a fire truck.

7765542,4,B01GRU5CQS,"A solid, if not great, horror film and a worthy follow-up to the future classic first film. Once again, we follow the Warrens as they investigate a haunting, this time involving a lower-middle-class British family. This is based on a true story, the famous Enfield Haunting--which inspired a pretty creepy documentary you might want to check out. It's a terrific setting for a haunted house/possession story. Set in the sixties, this film is actually a prequel to the first Conjuring, exploring what events brought Elizabeth Warren back into the spiritualism business, as well as what kept her out in the first place.

The youngest girl, played by Madison Wolfe, is especially great in the role of one of the daughters who draws the focus of a nasty demon. There are a great MANY jump-scares in this movie, more than any of Wan's other films. But James Wan has become a new master of horror and he knows how to play an audience like a fiddle. I admire his craft and love that he has almost single-handedly inspired a whole new renaissance of the horror genre. No dumb teenagers or high body count here, just pure adrenaline-inducing tension.

Like the Conjuring did for Anabelle, this film sets up a spin-off with a frightful nun, who looks like a combination of Marilyn Manson and...well...Marilyn Manson. Anyway, if you're in the mood for a tight little scare-fest, and you've got a strong enough heart to withstand a barrage of jump-scares, check out The Conjuring 2.",1532649600,,1470,4.829365079365079

7765545,3,B01GRU5CQS,"The First act was/is pretty good.
Just like the first one, this one is based on a true haunting. The Conjuring 2 is based off of the Einfield Poltergeist.

If you were a fan of the first Conjuring then, hopefully, you should enjoy a revisit with the glamorized version of the Warrens. (Honestly, I like the idea of a paranormal defective duo. Give me more of the fictional versions!)

The ending gets a little silly- but it looks cool.
The antagonistic spirit is more invasive than scary- but it looks cool.

The kind of movie that has a strong beginning but slowly you realize that the best parts were in the first hour/trailer.",1532304000,,629,4.548672566371682
7765546,3,B01GRU5CQS,"Much like the first movie, it is very well done and captivating; but then it falls into a complete shambles at the end. As far as horror movies go, the Conjuring series is a big step above the usual B-grade or lower that haunts the genre.  However, the endings disappointingly revert to Hollywood's lack of imagination and belief that over-the-top drama acceptably replaces a good story line.",1532217600,,392,4.850746268656716

7765551,3,B01GRU5CQS,"Quick Story:  Another Ed and Lorraine Warren tale this time set in England.  A family is tortured by a demonic spirit as the Warrens try to help.

Acting was mostly good. There were just a few moments I felt the words coming out of Ed Warren's mouth weren't carrying enough emotion such as the moment he continues on in the house when Lorraine is on the outside, it felt very flat there.  A few times Lorraine was overacting and trying to be too dramatic at times too.

Overall, Throughout the over two hours, this movie hovers between average to dumb to decent creepy.  It's a fairly long movie especially for a horror film.  Since it is so long, it takes a fairly long time to develop.  I liked the nun demon, that was pretty freaky looking and powerful.  The old man ghost kept hovering between being really dumb and cheesy to freaky too. I thought the jump scares used by this ghost in the 1st half couldn't have been any cheesier..they might as well had him yell ""boo"" each time..It had that feel.  There were some camera and editing effects I enjoyed - the moment the little girl blurred to the old man and back while in the arm chair. Otherwise the other effects were the same door slams, things moving on their own, things you'd expect from a possession or demon movie. Still this movie while okay didn't live up to matching it's predecessor.

  '''''''''  SPOILER ALERT NEXT;;;;;;'''''

 The thing I hated about the movie was how this film tried to connect the Amityville house with the England house by using the nun ghost.  The film begins at Amityville which had zero connection to the England case.  The England case also had not yet started as it began much later with the girls using the Ouija board which conjured the old man ghost.  Tons of dumb jump scares in the 1st hour as I mentioned earlier  (like when he yells ""My house!""  at the television scene, or the tent jump scares scream ""Ahh!' in the not once but TWICE in one movie - ...the first time the boy 1st half of the film.. and again Ed Warren near the end of the film, sorry script writing team, you suck).  So somehow the nun ghost transports to England from Amityville and the old man ghost is of no consequence in the end.  He actually becomes even less scary and more of a sympathetic character by the end as he helps Lorraine.  He just disappears too.  It's never even discussed why that nun demon was at both locations and also present at the Warren home.  So I don't hate the movie but I think like most sequels doesn't quite hit the same mark.  It's produced well, decent enough acting to enjoy this movie, but it's average at best.",1531180800,,2618,4.433962264150943

7765647,4,B01GRU5CQS,"There are not too many horror movies, or movies in general, anymore I feel I can take, because I feel a lot has fallen out of hand. This one is different. The director, James Wan, said that he wants to bring respect back to horror films, and that is exactly what I saw. While the movie does still follow its genre of being scary, it also has a very nice sense of sweetness to it. The family is very grateful, there is a love story between the Warrens, and there are special moments in this movie which are actually heart warming. I love kids, and I hate to see them be put up to wrong roles in other movies. In this movie, I love the cast, it was very scary, and it fulfills the horror theme. This is the type of horror I recommend, the kind that does not focus on gore, provocativeness, and crude humor. This felt like an old fashion horror, and I always look forward to James Wan's works since he has a very different approach.",1509926400,6,929,4.195530726256983

Only two camps of people will come not to enjoy this film - those craving only spurting blood and the occasional half-naked woman, and those vehemently opposed to the idea that the Bible may actually be telling us the truth about Lucifer and his allies.",1507939200,,502,4.408602150537634
7765656,5,B01GRU5CQS,"""Well, there's, uh, nothing we can do about that,"" says one of the police constables as they beat a hasty retreat after seeing something spooky in the Hodgson household.

I started watching The Conjuring 2 in the wee hours - 2am? 3am? - and got scurred enough that I quit watching until much later when it was light out. James Wan is a beast, man. Guy knows how to make legit spine-tinglers, knows how to stage a scene in such a way that you're anxiously peering around corners even before the camera gets there. The Conjuring 2 is a scary movie. You will get scurred.

We catch up with the paranormal world's preeminent power couple, Ed and Lorraine Warren, fresh off their investigation of the Amityville haunting, up in New York. The Warrens are riding high on publicity, conducting interviews, going on talk shows, never mind that, everywhere they go, there seem to be these expert academics who throw shade at them.

A year later, in 1977, deep in the holiday season, the church reaches out to the Warrens and asks them to get to Enfield, North London to help a harried single mother of four, one of whom is her possessed daughter. The Enfield haunting will be one of their most terrifying cases.

The Conjuring 2 meets all the conventions of horror cinema. So it's got that in common with lesser horror films. What elevates The Conjuring 2 is the consummate way Wan works his craft. But toss in, too, the expert writing. The acting performances are top notch. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as the ghostbusting Warrens are excellent yet again, lending genuine human drama and delivering an astonishingly grounded relationship as a couple. Their marriage feels like the real thing. One new ingredient is Madison Wolfe who is fantastic as the tormented 11-year-old Janet Hodgson. I appreciate the tight-knitness of not only the Warrens but also of the Hodgson family. You just feel so frightened for them all.

Me, I was biting my nails throughout wondering how they can possibly check the malevolent entity. The parapsychologist on site scornfully maintains that Peggy Hodgson, the mother, is either perpetrating a hoax or having a case of hysterical neuroses. Distressingly, Lorraine Warren's second sight is being clouded. The one thing she did glimpse in a vision is that her husband is doomed to a horrifying death. Also, there's a demonic nun waiting to pounce from the shadows.

I love the cinematography and the sound design, both working in concert to deliver genuine scare jumps. No fake-outs here. No ""oh, it's just the cat"" or ""oh, it's just your jerk friend pranking you."" In this one, when you hear something creeping, buster, it means THERE IS SOMETHING CREEPING! Great fun.",1506729600,,2694,4.845652173913043

7765706,3,B01GRU5CQS,"Having been reasonably entertained by the original, I recently viewed director James Wan's THE CONJURING 2.  Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga (wolf howl) reprise their roles as paranormal ""investigators"" Ed and Lorraine Warren; this time, they're heading across the pond to north London to investigate the demonic disturbances of the Hodgson household.  Poor Lorraine has a psychic connection to the demon making all the fuss, and when--gasp!--she recalls its name she has more power over it than Superman.

Reasonably entertained.  That's so appropriate an expression for this sequel.  The effects work--director Wan has a thing for upside down crosses.  And the visual ""Gotchas!"" are plentiful.  Actress Bonnie Aarons is sensationally creepy as the demonic nun in dire need of a dentist; hers is the face you never want to wake up to after a Saturday night bender.  Yes, this sequel is formulaic, predictable, and hopelessly contrived, but for 90
minutes of horror genre indulgence THE CONURING 2 manages to entertain, and give you a couple of goose bumps along the way.  Bring your toothbrush.

Excellent if you are into demonic related material. It is scary but does not contain bloody or any kind of violent material. Note: The only real connection between the movie 'The Conjuring' and this movie .....is Ed and Lorraine, and the general kinds of cases they usually become involved with. Two entirely separate cases, countries. The Warrens took the first case by their own choice via desperate plea from a family member. In this movie, the Catholic Church requested they access the situation on their behalf. Actors playing Ed and Lorraine are spot on! I love this movie and have watched it many times. Ed and Lorraine Warren should be made Saints. May Ed rest in peace he was a great gift to the world. Lorraine is as well and I still see her occasionally assisting with a case.

7765725,4,B01GRU5CQS,"A blockbuster, terror epic of a ghost story but lacking the near perfect, raw potency of the original film. This is largely due to the design choices for its main antagonist, Valak the demon that terrorizes the Hodgson family. One of its manifestations, The Crooked Man is very much a modern creature/character design. The sequence in itself is visually stunning, played beautifully by an actual character actor, but grievously misplaced in the films 70s setting. It also doesnt help that Valaks demonic nun impression bears a striking resemblance to Marilyn Manson. That being said, theres still plenty of original scares thanks to James Wans slow but sure ascent to modern Master of Horror status. Now, if only he would stop being distracted by fast cars and aquatic superheroes.

7765745,2,B01GRU5CQS,"Most of the reviews of this film are positive, as can easily be seen.  This is the second film with the same two actors portraying real-life Ed and Lorraine Warren, two self-appointed exorcists who are/were devout Catholics.  I say ""self-appointed"" because they aren't clergy (whom the Catholic church would traditionally use for an exorcism if they believed one was warranted--sorry about the unintended pun there) nor, as far as I know, did the Catholic church officially acknowledge them as such although they gained something of a reputation, certainly in the United States, for their activities.

The first film was about the Amityville Horror and the Lutz family who inhabited a house in which formerly a mass murder took place.  The Lutz family came to believe their son was possessed by the same evil spirit that supposedly caused a man previously to murder his whole family there.  The Warrens intervened and gained nationwide publicity as a result of the case.  Basically I enjoyed watching the movie including some specials on the disc in which several actual family members (but not the ""possessed"" son) were interviewed.  There remains controversy (of course) over the whole Amityville case.

In ""Conjuring Two"", as a result of their reputation, they get called in to investigate a case going on in England.  This is a family of a now-single mom struggling to raise three kids: two daughters and a son.  The father allegedly left her and got involved with ""a woman around the corner"" with whom he now has a pair of twin kids.  In Conjuring 2, things begin to go bad for this family when the younger girl is persuaded by a school friend to mess around with a sort of Ouija board.  From there, things rapidly grow worse.

I won't reveal much more about the plot details, but in the film the Warrens come in and, of course, ""save the day"".  They believe this is much worse than your run-of-the-mill evil ghost or possession; that in fact a Demon is taking possession of one of the children.  You can't get much higher up than that in the hierarchy of evil I guess, except Satan himself.

A lot of remarkable phenomena occur in the film.  This would be physical phenomena, that would be at least potentially much more easily verifiable than telepathy, precognition or other more subjective and internal events.  If things had really happened as portrayed, it should have caused a really major stir.

Checking other sources you'll see that in England this was not labeled a case of demonic possession nor haunting nor a ghost.  It was termed the ""Enfield Poltergeist"".  Reading other accounts of the happenings, they do in fact seem much more consistent with what has been termed ""poltergeist"" phenomena.  Usually a young teen is at the center of the activities.  Consciously, they are not aware of what they're doing.  A lot of very unusual happenings tend to occur, although they are generally not life-threatening or severely injurious.  In this case, we do in fact have an early-teen girl at the center of things.  On at least one occasion, she was filmed deliberately causing some of the phenomena that were being attributed to an unseen entity.  This in itself wouldn't necessarily mean that everything which happened could be so easily explained, but certainly strengthened the hands of skeptics who think the whole thing must have been a hoax.  More to the point of this movie: apparently the Warrens were involved for the sum total of one day!  They were ""disinvited"" when, reportedly, Ed Warren made a comment to the effect that ""a lot of money could be made"" by investigating what was going on.

The bottom line is: if you just want a good, scary story this might not scare you as much as you hoped.  It does have a few startling or briefly scary scenes, but for the most part it's predictable and simultaneously incredible.  On the other hand if you're looking for a good ""true"" story of a haunting or something like that, this seems to be so far from the real story that it is best viewed as pure fiction.  I came away from this significantly less impressed with the factual underpinnings of the tale than I did with the original ""Conjuring"" [and by the way, ""conjuring"" itself is a bit misguided for what these films seem to be aiming for, since it's more suggestive of a magician's act than of a demonic possession].

Well there it is.  Many will like it, despite what I personally see as weaknesses.  In general the acting is decent, even if the story is far less ""based on real events"" than it would have you believe.",1490745600,,4542,4.756066411238825

7765861,5,B01GRU5CQS,"Oh wow!  The Conjuring 2 is a tremendous horror.  I can't recall the first one very well at the moment.  Even though it was released only a few years ago, I can't remember much about it I'm afraid.  This means the opening segment with the seance... I'm not entirely sure if this particular scene reveals how the first Conjuring movie ended.  However you do NOT need to see the first Conjuring to enjoy part 2.  I love this movie to pieces man!

I have to say I absolutely love this seance scene.  I love how it was made from both a writing and cinematic point of view.  It's based on Vera and her husband's previous paranormal case in either the first Conjuring or a separate incident.  We see ghost investigator Vera Farmiga close her eyes, and a moment later her brain allows her body to transport to other rooms of the house witnessing terrifying evil roaming around.  When she travels to the basement and sees ghostly children, well that's terrifying enough.  But when she looks in a mirror, sees the ghosts behind her getting more numerous/more evil, turns around to see nothing there... only for a ghost woman to appear RIGHT in front of her when she tries to glance into the mirror again?  Oh man that's scary!

But you see, what makes the Conjuring 2 so great is that it often toys with your emotions.  Sometimes you'll witness a terrifying demonic encounter, but other times it's just atmosphere that leads to nothing or makes your eyes play tricks with your head.  That itself would be impressive, but you know the Conjuring 2 kicks up the storytelling even further.  Let me explain.

The story is about Vera Farmiga and her husband (played by Patrick Wilson, the same two actors from the first Conjuring).  They visit a small town in England to help a family (a mother, 3 sisters and a brother) after two of the sisters experiment with a ouija board.  Turns out a demon has a particular interest in the one sister, Madison Wolf's character.  Throughout the movie we see Exorcist-like moments when her voice turns demonic, the tone in the room becomes dreadful, lights flicker, and a burst of sinister energy is released in some way.

The family contact Vera and Patrick as a last resort.  Locally they bring over news reporters and another paranormal investigator (Simon McBurney's character).  The news reporter suspects the daughter might be faking the whole thing.  This aspect of the story continues later on which I'll mention below.

At first the mother (Frances O' Connor's character) thinks the kids are just trying to spook each other with little games when she discovers the ouija board tucked under the one daughter's bed... but then a moment later the dresser in the bedroom slides across the floor and slams into the wall prompting the entire family to leave their home and run across the street to their neighbors house terrified for their lives.

Soon enough we see several unforgettable moments on a smaller scale.  Perhaps these could be considered teasers since the story likes to unfold gradually to successfully get viewers to absorb a little bit of fear at a time before eventually going all in and scaring the wits out of you.  How about this one.  Madison wakes up, sits up in her bed, has a conversation with something her sister (played by Lauren Esposito) sleeping in the bed next to her can't see, and assumes Madison's talking in her sleep.  Then when Lauren goes back to sleep suddenly Madison is standing RIGHT in front of her and talking.  Lauren is confused and upset... until she hears the demonic voice ""This is my house!"" behind her.  This prompts the sisters to run to their mom's bedroom terrified.  Awesome stuff!

How about the little firetruck toy the little boy plays with (Benjamin Haigh) in front of a tent in the upstairs hallway?  The atmosphere here is done tremendously.  As the boy walks to his bedroom he hears the siren on the truck turn on as it moves across the floor.  Scared, he heads to his bedroom.  He continues to peek behind the hallway to make sure the truck isn't moving.  You know how a little kid's imagination can be- when something odd happens a kid might get concerned and think it's a ghost, encouraging the kid to keep a close eye on the object in question.  When the firetruck rolls down the hallway and gets his attention, he jumps out of bed.  He walks down the hallway and glances inside the tent to see something demonic.  To his mom's bedroom he runs!

My goodness, there's so many scary scenes.  Too many to mention!  These ones are legitimately awesome.  The Conjuring 2 really feels like a true horror film to me.  How about the moment when Madison's attached to the living room ceiling and watches the ghostly presence of an older man below jump off the chair, walk up the stairs and into the sister's bedroom?  Since Madison's stuck on the ceiling during this scene she can't free herself, so she's forced to feel the floor boards above shake!  A moment later she morphs up inside the bedroom and sits on the floor.  Little moments like these are absolutely terrifying to me.  Proof that ghosts and demons are scarier than anything else I can think of (at least, according to me- it's a matter of debate of course!)  It should be mentioned the rocking chair is the main source of all evil.  This is why Madison encounters things in this spot of the house more than anywhere else.  And yes, you know it- that chair's going to rock in the middle of the night!

How about the other moment that nearly made me poop myself?  When the brother walks across the hallway inside the neighbors house and hears a bell ringing.  They own a rottweiler and the dog likes to smack the bell with his nose or paw whenever he wants outside.  The boy assumes the dog is ringing the bell... but instead we see the dog morph into an extremely tall demonic figure and chase the frightened little boy back to his parents and siblings in the living room.  They all see a tall shadow coming down the hallway... only for it to be Madison Wolfe's character.  This poor girl is being tormented by this demon time and time again.  The way this figure branches out and grows tall right next to the boy is truly scary.

I badly want to mention the TV remote incident early on when the demonic incidents first begin and the scene with Patrick fixing a washing machine leak (wow, more like a flood!) in the basement only for a figure to rise from the water and cause harm, but I won't.  Remember when I said the Conjuring 2 kicks up the storytelling a lot more compared to most horrors?  Let me elaborate on that.  First of all this is supposedly based on a true story that took place in the late 70's which is why we hear the Clash, the Hollies and other bands (then again the Hollies ""Bus Stop"" is more suitable for a 60's tune but who cares, it's a great song!)

The way these events are told... eventually things don't add up according to the investigators.  It appears Madison Wolf is faking everything.  At least, everyone except Patrick and Vera have concluded the poor girl might be faking the entire possession.  I had to sit on my couch and think about this from the accusers point of view.  Even if she was faking, how can you explain a little girls voice suddenly turning demonic?  I mean it sounds *truly* demonic- not a little girl imitating a demonic voice.  The investigators should have caught onto this.  Also the bite marks on the girls neck... pretty sure poor Madison couldn't have bitten herself, and the mouth was too big for one of her sisters or brothers to have done it.  Investigation 101 guys.

This prompts Patrick, Vera, Simon and everyone else to leave the house after uncomfortably concluding Madison's been faking the entire incident (with their supposed video tape proof showing Madison throwing objects around in the kitchen).  There was also a seance that took place in the living room.  Madison reveals the demon won't make an appearance if the investigators are looking directly at her, so they turn around and ask questions.  AWESOME moment here- while they turn away you can see through the blurriness that Madison's body shape changes into a demon.  Similar to the rottweiler moment I mention above (except in the rottweiler scene, the dog changes shape in the darkness).

Anyway while this seance is going on, the investigators ask Madison to place water in her mouth to prove she's not speaking.  This seance occurs way before anyone suspected the girl might be faking.  Later on when the investigation team suspect she's faking the whole thing, they think she simply spit the water into the cup while their backs were turned, then took another sip when they turned around.  This is not the case though.  Before Patrick and Vera travel too far on the train and leave the country, they head back when they realize they've made a big mistake.  Also this is a SPOILER, but the supposed demon isn't as frightening as one would expect.  There's a reason why, and it's because he himself (the ghost of Bill Wilkins- the man who used to live in the house) is actually being controlled by a demon.  The demon says his name is Bill Wilkins. Bill's ghost is being controlled by an evil presence.

But wow is this movie awesome!  I never even mentioned Vera and her daughter are being haunted by their own black cloak-wearing beady eyed demon at home.  Her daughter feels the presence of a dark figure walking down the hallway while the two are relaxing in the living room.  Vera tells her daughter to hide in the room after they both terrifyingly see the dark figure standing at the end of the hallway.  Vera chases after the demon.  When she enters the room where the demon went, we see this portrait Patrick made (I think from a dream he had) that shows the same beady eyed demon that's now in the room somewhere.  I'm not sure if it's hilarious or scary that Vera sees the shadow of this demon walk across the wall, enter the picture frame from inside the wall, line up his body where his face would be, take his hands out from behind the wall, grab the picture frame, pull it off and literally RUN towards Vera pushing her into the back room.  This scene is almost hilarious even if it's not supposed to be.

Otherwise the Conjuring 2 excels as a really good horror movie.  Perhaps Patrick's character being a fixer upper around the house in England fixing plumbing issues, and picking up a guitar to sing Elvis tunes as a way to entertain the kids is a bit much though.  These scenes felt silly to me.  Then again they also serve as temporary relief from all the horrific events going on.  Then again, hey, these moments just add to the close relationship between Vera and Patrick, and add more to their side of the story (they didn't really want to investigate anymore homes- they were dragged into this incident in England in fact).

No complaints with this movie folks.  None at all!  Okay just one!  Elvis Presley's ""I Can't Help Falling In Love With You"" is way out of place.  Patrick singing this song to the kids is almost hilarious.  It would be like playing Black Sabbath's ""War Pigs"" at a little kid's birthday party.  Yeah, really out of place.  Highly recommended.",1485043200,,11170,4.598178137651822

7765871,3,B01GRU5CQS,"I'm a big fan of James Wan and the first Conjuring was awesome! So needless to say I was beside myself when I heard they were coming out with a second conjuring movie. Wow...kind of disappointed in the outcome. The movie had a great premise. The English setting was a nice change of pace. The cast was chosen perfectly with some new faces in the mix. The chills and scary moments were typical James Wan and done very well. Then by the second act, it all fell apart. The story became to convoluted, the scary moments more weird than scary (the crooked man was laughable with the strange clay-mation style effects) and the overall spookiness of the movie dwindled into a terrible episode of the X-Files. What happened to this movie? It had so much advertisement and hype when it first came out. The trailers were all over YouTube and it actually looked like a good movie.
I gave it three stars because it did have some good scenes that legit scared the crap out of me. And because Ed and Lorraine Warren and the story they told was awesome. But the ending made me feel disappointed and let down. I won't give away the ending but it left much to be desired. If they do a Conjuring 3 I hope they put much more effort into the story than they did the second one. I don't know, watch the second film and find out for yourself.",1484697600,3,1320,4.348178137651822

7765908,5,B01GRU5CQS,"Ok this was pretty scary.  Most horror movies these days seem to be done, redone and overdone.  And sequels rarely live up to or top the original film, but this one was pretty creepy. Like the first Conjuring film, it is one that I could watch over and over again.  Both classics.

7765916,4,B01GRU5CQS,Bit of a rehash of the first one but I never found myself bored. The characters are compelling and it managed to keep pace without feeling drawn out. Some clever scenarios left you guessing what and when something would jump out of the shadows. Great cast along with a pretty solid script makes a great movie. Well done.,1483660800,,320,4.5344827586206895

7765918,5,B01GRU5CQS,Great and future classic. Movie based on the real Ed and Lorraine Warren and one of their many cases. So much of horror sucks these days standard slasher flicks wear they just want gore for shock value they say but really? No this is a real case with real victims and the evil gets its ass Kicked !

Who else would praise every hackneyed haunted house/ghost story movie cliche in the book ever used to the extent they have?  This whole film is just non stop everything we have all seen before, mainly beginning with every effect and plot device used in THE EXORCIST.

This is mainly a horror story for the religiously inclined; those disbelief challenged faithers looking for a cheap thrill.  Pretty much a waste of time for anyone not steeped in the scriptures watching it.",1481932800,,701,4.704918032786885

These are just two questions that found me while watching the Conjuring 2. I thoroughly enjoyed the first film, but this couldn't even muster the sinister foulness of the first. There was too much held back from the viewer that wasn't necessary. It ended up being a typical serial horror with virtually nothing scary about it. The ending was about as fraught with forced resolve and red herrings just to get us there that is was anti-climactic. The writer or director didn't allow the viewer to connect with any of these people, so by the end, who cares what happens to them?",1481241600,,690,4.528

7766087,5,B01GRU5CQS,"An engaging human interest story in addition to an above-average demon possession tale - albeit still ""Hollywood-ized"". Screenplays for Conjuring 1 and 2 are based on case files of Ed & Lorraine Warren, world renowned demonologists, who often worked in cooperation with the Vatican and specially-trained priests beginning in the 1970's. With this sequel and the first Conjuring flick, it's also gratifying to see the comeback of Jesus Christ as the ultimate exorcist of demons in human beings. Lorraine even reads her Bible for spiritual re fortification. How often do you see that in movies or television? For a few decades, it seemed like there was no force greater than Satan in movies. While that may remain true in some studios, it has never been the case in the greater community of Christian faith. It's unusual for me to review and recommend a ""horror movie"" but as I said, it's not typical -- this one has more spiritual substance to it, and amazingly, the sequel is better than the first Conjuring. The acting is superb with the child actors being just as believable, if not more, than the adults. The cinematography, CGI and editing are top notch. I was impressed, and will most definitely watch these again while anticipating the release of Conjuring 3.",1480636800,,1265,4.91588785046729

7766126,5,B01GRU5CQS,"Everything that was done right in The Conjuring is done equally well or better in The Conjuring 2, with paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Faramiga) heading this time to England to investigate a case that would become known as the Enfield Haunting.  A newly single mother and her four children are the targets of malevolent entities, possibly attracted to the stress the family was under due to the recent seperation from the father.  Having such a mundane possible explanation floated as the genesis for the haunting may come off as bland to some, but I found it gave an eerie feel of authenticity to the film; it's like it was so plain no one would make it up.  Whatever originally initiated the haunting though, it soon goes from bad to worse and becomes a real threat to the people involved.  The Conjuring 2 is scarier than its predecessor and also excels in charaterization and overall production, with a great musical score by Joseph Bishara (who also did the music for the first Conjuring and Annabelle as well as for the Insidious movies).  Another thing of note is that the movie follows up on the plot thread from the original movie about an exorcism the Warrens were involved in prior to the main story in The Conjuring 1.  In this exorcism, the possessed man said or showed something to Lorraine that scared her so badly that she nearly quit.  That gets explained and followed up on in here.  I could go on with superlatives like 'excellent' and 'intense', but the bottom line is just that The Conjuring 2 is one of the best movies of the year and a must-see for anyone who liked the first Conjuring and Annabelle even a little bit, or for horror fans in general.

7766166,3,B01GRU5CQS,"This film recalls ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"" and ""The Amityville Horror"" but that's not entirely a good thing.  I'm not certain this is an homage or a parody of those films.  Whereas the original challenged its audience this film is too reliant on obvious effects.  Loud noise and blinding lights are a poor substitute for genuine terror.  I'm not suggesting that this is a bad film.  It's eminently watchable abetted once again by terrific work by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as stalwart lay exorcists Lorraine and Ed Warren.  It's disappointing that the filmmakers couldn't conjure up something more original instead of treading familiar ground.",1478908800,,654,5.180952380952381

My kudos to them for their sacrifices made to help oust unwanted spiritual activities. As far as the movie, It is VERY watchable, interesting and a REAL eye opener for a ton of people who don't want to believe in the supernatural...or its obvious traps.

7766213,2,B01GRU5CQS,"I'm not a movie critic - but I respectfully feel ""The Conjuring"" is a much more terrifying movie than its sequel.

I suppose what drew me to The Conjuring (as a series) was this sort of balance between ""believability"" and ""supernatural."" In The Conjuring it wasn't THAT big of a stretch - you have an evil entity that is largely undetectable outside of the various ""happenings"" that plague the family. You don't *really* see the entity until the end save a couple quick glimpses. Loose ends are tied up.

BUT, I digress, this is a review of ""The Conjuring 2.""

SPOILERS AHEAD

This movie is awash in opacity - we see the evil entities nearly from the beginning. That includes the old man, the nun, and the slender-esque creature. I'm not afraid - I'm not able to be afraid - I've SEEN the adversary. That takes the suspense out of this movie for me. The ""fear factor"" for me is the ""unknown"" property of the evil entities. Please see my above reference to the first ""The Conjuring."" The supernatural element is NOT subtle - it's TOO obvious. We visit the case of the Italian man who was able ""to speak Latin backwards"" and it's here we are introduced to the Nun. And, figures, Ed paints a picture of this entity. Great, no mystery.

I'm trying to make this short. So my other issue is the conclusion. Where did the Nun come from? I KNOW she came from Lorraine's dream - but WHY? We should ground the Nun better in some element of reality beyond a ""dream/vision/premonition."" She is defeated...and that's that. No exposition. What happens to the ""old man""? The evil ""puppet"" - did he go to heaven? No? Dissipate? Go to hell?

Give me an ending, movie. Certain ends have to be tied. Not all of them! Not necessarily at least. But *some* have to be to deliver some element of satisfaction. This would be forgivable if this was a cliffhanger to a third movie - but the reality is - it's not.

But again, I'm no critic. I've just learned to enjoy certain elements in horror films and stories - they involve the ""unknown."" Nothing is more horrifying than an unknown entity wrecking, purposeful havoc. This movie, bluntly, is too obvious.",1478476800,5,2131,4.5483028720626635

7766247,4,B01GRU5CQS,"Whether you believe the events are true or not, this movie is a scary one.

Based on a paranormal investigation in England, it features the psychic investigators from ""The Conjuring"" this time as the main characters.

After being accused on a TV talk show of being fakes, Lorraine Warren decides to stop delving into the actual psychic end of the paranormal but simply do investigations.  The fact that during their study of the Amityville house, she had a vision of her husband's death, aids her decision. Then, their pastor asks them to go to England and determine the veracity of a ""haunting...""

Cliches are present, to be sure, but also some twists here and there, such as putting the investigators in a certain amount of jeopardy. There are plenty of shock moments in this...and a few where you'd expect them and they don't appear, making the tension even more so. It's chills a-plenty, with the creepiness making this a good Halloween film.  It's also the kind I'd suggest you not watch alone or late at night.  I did both, and I'm not ashamed to admit it...I stopped a quarter way into the movie, and finished the next morning in broad daylight.  Laugh if you will...watching this and listening to a house creak and groan around and various electrical appliances rattle and groan you can do things to the most steadfast imagination!

The child actress playing the girl at the center of the investigation is great as a frightened child who isn't believes and someone brave enough to persevere with the Warrens' encouragement.

This was such a good film, I find myself wondering if there will be a Conjuring 3 and actually looking forward to it if there is.

This movie was viewed as a rental DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1478304000,,1766,4.723127035830619

7766283,2,B01GRU5CQS,"The Conjuring was a decent throwback, I didn't love it but I thought it was solid. I'm not exactly a fan of James Wan, he barely ever shows restraint with his brand of horror, but I liked the first half of Insidious as well as most of the original Conjuring. This sequel, while it's ambitious and does bring several new things to the table, is much more cartoony and cheesy than I ever expected it would be. The movie is so over dramatic at times, its really just too much.

I never got into these movies cause I believe in ghosts or the story of the Warren's. They are well known charlatans and I couldn't care less about the supposed true events that these movies supposedly portray. I get into these movies simply for the entertainment value. And I really like the actors playing the Warren's, they're really likeable, I just don't believe anything in terms of real events.

Several people in the theater were laughing right from the opening and that's never a good thing in a horror movie. I will admit that as far as jump scares go, these are top notch. The Conjuring 2 has some very effective scares, I just wish it showed more restraint like the original. I also didn't care for some of the creature/ghost designs. The Crooked Man wasn't really working due to the phony CGI. Several other things I could nitpick as well but I'll just once again point to my previous complaint- this movie was just too cheesy and cartoony for my tastes, and I'll pretty much leave it at that. It's a huge step back from the first in nearly every way.",1477958400,,1539,4.453900709219858

7766293,4,B01GRU5CQS,"My daughter and I really enjoyed the original Conjuring so we decided to watch this sequel just before Halloween. We both thought it was very well made. As with the first, the art direction is really good. Both movies are basically ghost stories told back in the 60's/70's. I thought the look of the movie's ""bad guy"" was absolutely terrifying. However, the ghost of the previous owner, who is actively haunting the home, is not really quite as scary (to me). Just seemed like a person wearing makeup. Although the scene in the basement where he surprises them is quite scary. By the way, what is the deal with their flooded basement? There is basically a lake under their home.

All in all, if you enjoyed the first movie, no reason you won't like this one. It's a very worthy follow-up. Also, in case you are wondering, you absolutely don't need to have seen the first movie to understand everything in this one. You are just missing some backstory on the main characters, which isn't necessary here.",1477958400,,1002,4.661016949152542

The Exorcist was #1 until the Conjuring came out.
The 2nd Conjuring didn't have the twists and turns and frightful entities like the first one did. All I can is that there was one ghost that ended up ""Where did he go? Did he cross over?""
And there was the demon nun. But that's about all. Not scary one bit.

7766350,2,B01GRU5CQS,"not close to the creepiness of the original.  basically stole from the exorcist plot, script and mother reaction shots. another movie where professionals are called in to help a traumatized family and actually witness supernatural events, to then later on say it was some kind of trick, leave, and the family has to figure it out themselves anyway!

There isn't anything here that I'd rate as 'bad', but the one thing I noticed in this one as opposed to the other two is that it relied more on showing you more (more what?  at the risk of ruining anything I won't say), but that and more special effects.  Not a lot of effects, but they're noticeable and in comparison to the other two films, kinda kicked us out of the movie.  Having said all that, again, not a bad movie and I'd probably watch another in the 'Warren' series.",1477267200,,631,4.26890756302521

7766381,4,B01GRU5CQS,Fantastic sequel. The only reason for it not being a 5 is because of the cgi figure. That was unnecessary and made the movie silly rather than scaring,1477180800,,150,4.392857142857143

7766384,5,B01GRU5CQS,"I'm a huge fan of horror movies, stories, and tales. I purchased the first Conjuring movie and I was a little bit disappointed because I did not find it creepy nor scary. I was waiting for the Conjuring 2 movie to come out on Prime Video. However, after reading all of the positive reviews regarding the Conjuring 2 movie; I made the choice to purchase it. I'm actually glad I did not wait. A lot of the reviews have already went into the plot of the story (which I think can be a bit of a spoiler for people who have not viewed the movie) so I will not go into the plot. I will state that this movie is scarier than all the Amityville horror movies combined. Think of the original Exorcist movie and this movie kind of piggybacks around that theme. It does have a slow buildup however, the middle and end results are perfect. It's a perfect sequel (usually sequels are not that scary). One of the points that make this movie so visually scary and entertaining; is the fact that it is told from a child's point of view. I enjoyed watching a little bit of the Warren's family story. I love the fact that some portions of this movie were based on a true story as well. When the old man showed his face quickly (from behind the television screen) I thought I was going to wet my pants. Small parts of the movie were actually touching (I will never forget how this movie introduced me to the beautiful song ""Falling in Love With You""). Overall, it's a perfect Halloween treat for any horror movie fan. There are no graphic sex scenes, blood, or gore. It's just an entertaining, old school setting, with a well-rounded cast movie. I recommend this movie.",1477180800,31,1649,4.392156862745098
7766385,5,B01GRU5CQS,"Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are excellent to their roles. ""The Conjuring 2"" is an excellent example of what more sequels should aspire to be. It takes viewers to a thrilling ride that keeps you on the edge. It is a perfectly executed haunting movie from James Wan that dives deep below the surface to explore themes of vision, belief and faith, and the family drama is still at the center and is quite effective. Can't wait for the next one!",1477180800,,445,4.506172839506172

7766393,5,B01GRU5CQS,Yes,1477094400,,3,3.0
7766394,4,B01GRU5CQS,Fantastic horror movie. 2 hours of nothing but setups followed by payoffs. Only thing that kept it from being 5 star was the over the top and ridiculous ending.,1477094400,,160,4.551724137931035
7766395,3,B01GRU5CQS,"Why anyone gives this 5 stars puzzling. Oddly the critics love it too, but then again they love Sharknado. This is overly done, the ghost is more than willing to talk to a anyone, the ghosts don't go away when the lights come on. It just takes away from the movie when so many people know the house is haunted and the ghost is seen and heard from at the beginning of the film. And the whole thing with the media's involvement is a bit over the top too. Nothing was scary, everything was predictable, script was lame, it could have been much better if the ghost was seen less, fear of the unknown instead of it being known by the whole neighborhood. The possession scenes are also stupid, they are just holding a normal conversation with him. The first movie was great, but as sequels usually go, this wasn't. This comes off more as a super natural mystery thriller than a haunting horror film. The mystery is good, the story isn't bad but for it's name sake and the genre it is listed in the movie isn't that great. Don't go into this expecting anything like your usually haunting movie, think of it more like an episode of Ghost Whisper, Super Natural or Deadbeat.",1477094400,,1165,4.423255813953489

7766411,3,B01GRU5CQS,"Exactly as my star rating says, I say, ""Eh, it's okay."" ""The Conjuring 2"" is not horrible, but, like the first in the series, it still tries far too hard to be ""The Exorcist"". It doesn't help that I no longer believe in the polarized, black-and-white ""there is always a solid good and a solid evil"" dichotomy that these films always rely on to thrill the culture that was either raised in church for whom the psychological sinews of that may still hold on tight or they still go and wholeheartedly believe all of it for reasons I will never understand. I do give it props for one scene involving a very tall being that would've made Tim Burton smile, that was a little more original for the ""haunted house"" genre. Anymore I tend to prefer psychological thrillers, slasher films, or something like ""The Witch"" that relies 99% on atmosphere instead of the emotionally fleeting jump scares.",1477008000,,887,4.656050955414012

7766428,4,B01GRU5CQS,This wasn't a bad movie. Highly fictionalized rather than telling the watcher anything about the actual occurrence. For instance at this point the warrens were well into their fifties and their daughter an adult. The demon thing never happened and the warrens spent less than a day with this family but you know whatever sells. I greatly dislike the need in these films to make the warrens hero's and the in your face ghosts. I would find it far more interesting if these movies left us guessing as to whether or not they were scam artists or legit whether the families were crazy on drugs or actually haunted. Much like the others and what lies beneath left us guessing until the last little bit.,1476921600,,697,4.629032258064516

It's scary, it's got suspense, and a great slow build to the awesome climax at the end where the demon that is haunting this family is banished from our world.  The very end of the movie does show us the museum room again with all the haunted items in it like it did in the first movie.  And in the background you can see Annabelle in her locked display case and it's a nice nod to the spinoff movie where she was the star.

So it's really a great scary movie that knows how to build a spooky atmosphere and then delivers the goods at the end!  Any horror fan will enjoy this very much.  Check it out!",1476835200,,651,4.046875

7766467,5,B01GRU5CQS,"I love to watch Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as real life demonologist couple Ed and Lorraine Warren!  They play Roman Catholic demonologists in both this movie and the first Conjuring movie.  This couple was involved in the famous Amityville horror investigation as well as numerous other documented and well-known paranormal cases. Much of their work was done as agents of the Roman Catholic Church.  Ed Warren was the only exorcist to ever be sanctioned by the Catholic Church that was not a member of the clergy.  Lorraine Warren worked as a sensitive and medium for her entire career again with the blessing of the Catholic Church. Both of these things are highly unusual and lend credence  authenticity to thier story.  Although they investigated well over 10,000 cases they say only a small percentage were actually paranormal in nature. I genuinely wish they had come up with better titles for these movies because they are based on a real couple and their real cases making these movies more than just ""jump and scare"" flicks. These movies are different than your typical horror films. They are far more interesting in storyline and are laced with compassion.  The starring couple genuinely wants to help the families in the movies giving the movie more depth and realness than your typical horror film.  I preferred the first movie to the second but really enjoyed seeing more from this couple's case history.  I really hope they make another one! I would absolutely recommend it, it's a lot of fun!",1476748800,,1512,4.921259842519685

7766488,3,B01GRU5CQS,"The movie is very good. James Wan really understands this genre. Generally speaking I love his films.

The issue I have is in calling it ""based on a true story"" when so little of it is. They made this film without the permission of Janet Hodgeson, and then at the end they state she lived her whole live in the house and died sitting in that same old chair at just 38 years old. She's still alive and doing just fine. Like the Perron case (profiled in The Conjuring) this was one of the cases that the Warrens could not solve. Also, it was a poltergeist. NOT demonic. The family was not religious at all, so they didn't care for the Warren's techniques. They'd suffer for years before allowing a priest to come in, which calmed the phenomenon. But didn't stop it all together.",1476576000,,776,4.388888888888889

7766495,4,B01GRU5CQS,"Must admit it takes an awful lot to unnerve me these days, guess i've seen far too many chillers down the years
for them to have much effect these days....having said that the chilling fact of films such as this is that they are
based on documented evidence of the events....which for me is what makes tje film worth viewing.
Set in the mid-to-late 1970's -
'Patrick Wilson' and 'Vera Farmiga' reprise their roles as paranormal investigators 'Ed and Lorraine Warren'
After investigating whether a demonic presence had been involved in the Amitytiville Killings, 'Ed and Lorraine'
one year on are asked to fly to London to investigate strange occurrences that had befallen the 'Hodgson' house-
hold in Enfield where 11 year old Janet had been experiencing disturbing happenings which had also began to
affect the others living in the house, so much so they had become too scared to stay there.
'Ed and Lorraine' have to determine whether what appears to be possessing 'Janet' is a genuine happening, the
signs are that they are....though a fellow investigator has doubts....to refer it on, the two have to be convinced it
is not an elaborate hoax.....when 'Janet' is filmed deliberately throwing furniture and crockery about in the kitchen
it seems that it's game-over.....however whilst planning to go back to the States 'Ed' has to clarify something that was
troubling him which leads to he and 'Lorraine' returning to Enfield....it was as well they did.
Though i didn't really find the film to be scary it's easy to see how some of the images would be to many....the fact
it is based on a real happening is why, for me, it's worthy of a viewing.
Makes one wonder that's for sure ...

7766506,5,B01GRU5CQS,"James Wan has proven himself to be arguably the greatest horror director of his generation. To be able to make a sequel to one of the greatest horror movies of the 21st century (so far) and make it AS good, if not in some cases better than the original, is just about as impressive a feat that exists in filmmaking. It is all too rare these days to get a genre film with the level of quality that Wan has been able to deliver here yet again.

Because we know that Ed & Lorraine Warren are/were real people, and that this is once again another 'true' story of theirs, the feeling you get when you watch these films is different. Beyond just making a sincerely effective fright flick, James Wan also made an excellent period piece. The classic film grain look as well as the color grading, great costumes and era relevant music and cars nailed the feeling of 1977.

Overall the greatest thing about this movie is that, like it's predecessor, it is nothing like 90%+ of the 'scary' movies that come out today. This is not a cheap, jump scare, chair jumper movie. It is a genuine horror movie that was designed to terrify you, over and over and over. Without sounding blasphemous, Wan is doing with horror for us the same thing Friedkin did for The Exorcist and Kubrick did for The Shining. Appreciate the quality of this film.",1476403200,9,1323,4.462809917355372
7766507,2,B01GRU5CQS,"This horror movie was extremely over hyped as scary.  After I watched it and felt disappointed, I realize that these demon movies just do not qualify as scary to me anymore.  Maybe normal, spiritual people full of fear from whatever is going on in their life react differently.  Overall, it was a good attempt to scare people, but it didn't work on me.  The plot was decent, but I was very disappointed in how the demon was defeated.

Movies that seem to bubble up some fear in me are the realistic survival movies, such as America becoming a waste land and everybody is living within Nature's elements.  This could really happen, not the Conjuring plot.",1476403200,,654,4.643478260869565

They used allot of CGI which I'm not huge on especially when it comes to just ridiculous notions. It's really almost the same story as before, find the demons name and use God to cast it out. I think allot of the hype is because of the Warren's but in my opinion it was alright I would definitely put what lies beneath ahead of this one.",1476403200,2,503,4.185567010309279

The storyline is incredibly stupid and cringe-inducing. The climax is as trite as one could ever imagine in which the ""great evil"" is expelled with minimal effort as our heroes wind down.

In short, this is the type of movie where a family can be terrorized savagely by an entity, only for a lovely musical montage in the middle in which they go out shopping together for some laughs.",1476144000,,655,4.598290598290598

7766597,5,B01GRU5CQS,"Holy moly. Scary movies have fallen very short lately (at least true horror movies that aren't just full of gore) and have a track record of being very disappointing, so it's rare to come across one that both genuinely scares people while actually being good. I watched this with this hubby, who makes a point to never jump or show that he's scared and laughs at those who do, with the lights on. Within the first 5 minutes we both had jumped and I had about 4 heart attacks.

The movie follows the TRUE STORY of a recently divorced mother with 4 children in England who experience an insane paranormal ordeal. They experience activity ranging anywhere from shadows to furniture thrown across the room and appearances/possessions by more than one demon. What I loved was that these activities didn't just occur to only the family, it happened in front of policemen and neighbors and investigators as well, making it way more realistic and frightening. It wasn't one of those things where you find yourself screaming at the TV for them to just get out of the house, because they do at one point and it follows them there too, knowing no bounds. They seem to touch on almost every type of fear relating to paranormal things so it was well ranged...a critic might say it had too many elements but I thought that was kind of genius because it will reach into a wider range of fears that people harbor. At one point they bring out The Crooked Man, I'll admit his animation wasn't great but still scared the wits out of me due to my fear of unnatural body movement and overly tall, thin people.

This is by far the best scary movie I've ever personally seen and is absolutely perfect for this coming Halloween.",1476057600,,1704,4.565359477124183

7766642,5,B01GRU5CQS,"Most horror films these days concentrate more on being gory, gross or putting together a really cool creature or corpse that skin comes off when a character touches it or something special effects makeup wise. There's of course your slasher films that have been the most successful of the horror film. Nothing wrong with any of those things, I love those films too, but you hardly ever come across big budget horror movies these days that are designed to be scary. Conjuring 2 does this though. Sure it's predictable, and likely has very little to do with the ""true story"" it is loosely based on, but these things don't really matter when you've been entertained for over two hours, with something going on all the time. Madison Wolfe does a brilliant job as Janet the most targeted for torment child of the family by what's in the house. The acting for the Janet character would have either made this a great film or a terrible one. If horror films were taken more seriously by award bodies, Wolfe would certainly be up for best actor awards for this. Vera Farmiga (Bates Motel) and Patrick Wilson again do a great job as The Warrens.

Like most haunted house films of course you wonder why the first time the family knows for sure there's something there they don't just cut their financial losses, walk out the door and not come back. But you wouldn't have a movie if that happened. In the deleted scenes (found on region 4 DVD) there is a scene where they do address this sort of, where they decide if it didn't leave Janet alone when she stayed with the Nottingham's, it's likely to follow her wherever she goes so they might as well deal with it in the house. There are decisions that characters make like in any horror film where you scream at the screen why would you do that? But again this is a staple of horror films.

Very few sequels surpass the original in their entertainment factor. Especially horror movies, where most sequels are let's face it, pretty terrible. The Conjuring 2 however is more than worth your time checking out.",1475712000,,2046,4.587431693989071

7766757,5,B01GRU5CQS,"Its no secret that James Wan only makes horror classics, and this is his latest masterpiece. Despite the deceptively clich premise, the film is a funhouse of fear, using all sorts of perfectly executed scares to keep viewers on edge. The director just understands the typical rhythms and beats of the genre so well, that he knows exactly how to maximize the fright in every sequence with precise and off-kilter timing. The plot has a variety of novel inventions too which subvert traditional expectations and tropes, making this a further evolution of the haunted house/possession genre.

But beyond the filmmaking, the plotting is smart too, patiently marrying disparate subplots into one big, cohesive finish. The main characters may appear kinda square, but they have an earnest strength that makes them admirably cool. From the light touches of humor, the flawless period production design, to the familys heartfelt emotional struggles, this is a well-made movie by any metric. But as its first function is fear, it particularly excels in that regard like few horror films ever do.",1475193600,,1085,5.1647727272727275

7766793,1,B01GRU5CQS,"This stuff is getting pretty formulaic. I wanted to like this film. I really did. I can even appreciate the idea of ""exaggerating"" a true story a bit for the sake of entertainment. What I can never forgive however, is the bald, finger-pointing-in-your-face, mawkish, bible-humping, overwrought proselytizing that this film absolutely reeks of. What I'm speaking of specifically are the countless needless digressions alluding to the relationship between Ed and Lorraine and their endless, embarrassingly deadpan, discussions about the precise ins and outs of ""demon"" hunting. I get it already. They're a down-home, family-values, guitar-strummin' happy American couple. That would be fine if this wasn't supposed to be a horror film. But after a while, it literally sucked (and I do mean sucked) so much of the entertainment out of the film that by the time the scares reappeared, I needed my hand to support to my chin to keep from falling over with abject boredom. The first one was definitely better. The digressions were fewer. The ""family"" moments were brief, generalizable to a wider audience, and meaningful. Most importantly, they didn't take away from the general aura of misgiving because the proselytizing was far, far less prominent. What I really don't understand is what exactly James Wan is expecting us to derive from all this. What I understand even less, is how audiences that aren't American can relate to any of this. It must be a terrible disappointment to see the value of enterntainment being slowly  replaced by the odiously conspicuous urge to ""convert"" audiences over to some horribly narrow viewpont that only a comparatively small demographic can relate to. What a pathetic substitute. I think I'm done with James Wan at this point. Maybe Ty West will start to get a little better. He certainly couldn't do worse than this.",1475020800,,1851,5.129139072847682

7766809,4,B01GRU5CQS,"I enjoyed this and would recommend it. Now it not as ""intense"" as the first one, but it has it's moments and is a great one to watch right before bed.  It will make you think you heard noises in the other room. This is the Amityville Horror of England and it's pretty well made. I really like Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. They play the ""clairvoyant devil seekers"" and they were the couple Ed and Lorraine Warren who were the couple that found Amityville and this one takes place in North London known as the Enfield poltergeist. Like I said it isn't as good as the first one, but I only watch 3 star or better when it comes to horror movies. So I do think this is worth watching and definitely not a 5 star, but how many scary movies really are? I liked it.",1474934400,,761,4.1768707482993195

If you liked the first movie, this one will not disappoint, unlike so many other sequels.
This movie about the ""Warrens"" paranormal investigators, set back in the 70's and how they go to England to help a girl who is being intermittently possessed by a demon.  I won't add any spoilers, but it has a few little twists and it kept me interested.  Not as ""creepy"" or scary as I had hoped, but still a very good movie and correlated with ""true events"" gives viewers that extra ""eerie"" sense.

It does what the Conjuring (I) could not: make you care for and believe in a group of people without making them a caricature. It is weighty enough to feel substantial, dealing with religious overtones and questioning one's faith, while still being lighthearted enough to feel good. And it ends in hope.

I loved this movie, even though the climax felt quite a bit rushed and somewhat anticlimactic. It was a great film, directed superbly, with outstanding actors all around.",1474934400,,535,4.8791208791208796

7766910,5,B01GRU5CQS,"James Wan is probably the biggest name in horror right now, every big movie has his name attached to it, and for the most part, he hasn't missed a beat. I liked Insidious, i felt it was a bit too crazy, but it was engaging, i absolutely loved The Conjuring and the original Saw is a classic in my opinion. The Conjuring is his most frightening and well made film, and the sequel expands on it infinitely. Back are the well written and acted characters, the engaging story, the genuine emotion, but with a more claustrophobic environment. While i didn't find it AS scary as the first, The Conjuring 2 brings back the same formula of holding back on jumpscares, letting you take in the almost unbearable tension, builidng up to nothing or something unsettling. This style of horror may be a huge turn off for a lot of viewers expecting to jump out of their seats, but for someone who wants to literally cringe from the anxiety and fear, this is the perfect movie. I hope this franchise continues under James Wan and stays this consistent. The spin offs on the other hand....",1474675200,,1072,4.530927835051546

7766920,4,B01GRU5CQS,"Horror meister James Wan, creator of the seven-film Saw nightmare, worked hard to escape the sequel curse in the follow-on to his well-reviewed 2013 demonic shocker, The Conjuring. And it shows.

The Conjuring 2 is a complicated, multi-segmented narrative that's much longer, more elaborate, more dramatic, and more packed with chilling moments and hair-raising visuals than one could anticipate, even from Wan.

Returning stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson act their hearts out as real-life ghost-and-ghoul hunters Lorraine and Ed Warren.

The film, a horror flick with the chutzpah to run 133 minutes, tries at real emotional depth and complex plotting. It tries, in other words, to reach epic status.

Does it succeed? Eh, I guess so. There's a lot more here than in the first film, but it doesn't feel quite as exciting.

A postmodern American Gothic bouillabaisse, The Conjuring 2 opens with what seems to be a sequel to The Amityville Horror, with the Warrens investigating the house made famous by a half-dozen films, including Stuart Rosenberg's 1979 classic.

Just as we're settling down into the story, the scene changes, and the Warrens are off to England and another famous case, the Enfield Haunting, also the subject of books and flicks.

But Wan's film isn't merely a meta tourist jaunt through horror movie history. Once it takes root in England, it blossoms into a full-blooded thriller.

Wan pulls out all the stops - does he ever - as he takes us through a warped story about a working-class single mum, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), whose life is turned inside out by an evil apparition that takes up residence in Peggy's preteen daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe).

I sometimes confuse the Conjuring pics with the Insidious franchise of demon-infestation flicks, which features Lin Shaye as a very Lorraine Warren-like psychic and ghoul-exterminator.

Wan's films, however, have heart. Maybe even a soul.",1474675200,,1929,5.173633440514469

7766951,3,B01GRU5CQS,"The Enfield Poltergeist was a Hoax, and a well documented one at that, which the Warrens had very little to do with, but of course every case the Warrens were involved with somehow became demonic possessions or one form or another.  I see studio wrangled the surviving family members to step up for promotional spots too.  I'm sure they were paid well...

The movie is entertaining, but is mostly made up nonsense when it comes to the Warrens.  If you like scary movies, and I count myself in that group, then it's a fun movie which I enjoyed.  It gave me the chills more than once. However it needs to be said that the Warrens are well known charlatans who (Especially the late Ed Warren) just wanted to make a quick buck.  Funny how they documented all these strange goings on through the years (With Audio and Video supposedly) yet there has been precious little of that supposed evidence released to the public. I wonder why??

One of the investigators of the Enfield case had this to say about Ed Warren: ""All I can remember is Ed Warren telling me that he could make a lot of money for me out of it. So I thought, 'Well that's all I need to know from you' and I got myself out of his way as soon as I could.' ""

I'm sure there will be a Conjuring 3 with more made up non-sense about how the Warrens were heroes, and I'll probably watch that too. Can take some solace in Ed is dead and unable to partake in the new found fame.  Lorraine is probably laughing all the way to the bank.",1474502400,,1487,4.263345195729538

7766962,4,B01GRU5CQS,"There have been a lot of reviews praising The Conjuring 2 (TC2) as superior than the original, and while I don't disagree, I believe some of the thematic elements remain the same. Perhaps the distinguishing factor that propels this one above its predecessor has more to do with the on-screen chemistry between Vera Farmiga & Patrick Wilson. Portraying real life Ed & Lorraine Warren, there is a magnetic and deep sense of love they offer one another rooted in things a relationship between two people calls for such as guidance, patience and strength in the face of adversity. In this sequel, it simply feels like both Farmiga & Wilson have reached a better understanding of their personas as well as their interaction with one another.

Assuming you had seen the first one, youll remember that Farmigas character uses visions to help clear the path of demonic forces that conspire against humankind. One of her visions disturbed her to the point where she decided to put an end to the work that she and her husband (Wilson) had been doing and yet the inherent struggle to stand by while others are in need propels the would-be demonologists to take on another case and assist an English family nonetheless. Such is the premise for this extremely well produced film by James Wan.

It seems like the horror genre is robust enough to be further divided into subdivisions such as slasher flicks, gore-fests, psychological thrillers and supernatural sagas which is why recommending a film under the huge umbrella of Horror is not such a great idea at times.  While the audiences for Cannibal Holocaust, Scream, Saw and Silence of the Lambs may be vastly different, a film that encompasses traits from these different sub-divisions is hard to come by. If there is one film that stands alone in this distinction, it would have to be the film The Exorcist, hands down. While CJ2 is no Exorcist, it accomplishes what it sets out to do quite effectively borrowing components without compromising its core - what goes bump in the night?

The cinematographer and supporting cast do a fine job of setting up scares and even though you may think you know how the filmmaker will take you to a scare, its really the combination of all the elements (lets not forget the sound, music and film editing) working in tandem that will creep you out. The director uses all the essentials to deliver an experience that does not talk down to audiences or treats them like idiots but rather tells of his love of cinema.

Bottom line: Incidentally, I watched this on Amazon, so Im not able to speak to the quality/purpose of extra features on the disc. I do recommend setting aside the need to draw a comparison to the first film and allowing the material from this film draw you into the atmospheric world of the Warrens. Some audience members may delight in the knowledge that this film is based on one of the Warrens case files. However, one may watch this film without realizing this aspect and instead concede that the real driving force of the film is regarding the balance that Lorraine Warren struggles to keep in helping others versus a loss at her great, personal expense. There is an underlying theme that the potential for human suffering and loss of life at the hands of malicious beings is truly the scariest thing of all. To quote Edmund Burke, The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.  Excellent, A-",1474502400,,3427,4.731993299832496

While it says it's based on a true story it seems that most of it has been exaggerated and that there were times when the writers were just trying to fill in time.

Just like Amityville Horror this story is filled with lots of people claiming that it was a hoax and given the accounts of other parties it does seem like something a young girl did for attention. The movie also exaggerates the involvement of the Warrens in the case and it was stated that they showed up for a day then left.

But, aside from that, ""Conjuring 2"" just did not live up to the drama and scares that came with the first film.  I believe part of that was due to a disjointed plot whose base is divided between America and England, but also perhaps because the infestation of evil into a home with four kids was done very well in the first, and is a bit ""old school"" in this follow-up.  It's still better viewing than a lot of other movies that came out at the same time, and the actors who play the Warrens are always pretty much on the mark and quite believable.

I liked this one just as well as the first.  I love how at the end they show the Actor's/ Actresses next to the real life people the story was based off of. It's hard finding good scary movies these days. I thought this one definitely made the cut. If you liked The Conjuring and Annabelle then this one will not disappoint. Some movies start off slow or sometimes drag, this one got started right at the first scene and draws you in through the entire movie. We really liked it.",1474329600,,652,4.380165289256198

But when he does do jump scares, it's well deserved. The visual aesthetic for the ""monsters"" in this movie are so creepy and it helps when the movie only gives you a bit at a time so that you don't know when something is coming or not. All actors did well in this movie as well, I was definitely immersed in the movie.

I was blown away by this second outing in the ""Conjuring"" series. If you knew me you'd know I very rarely ever say that. I've had nothing good to say about horror movies for the last 10 years.

There's an exception to every rule and ""Conjuring 2"" is most assuredly that exception.

A must-see for any serious horror fan and an absolute must-have for your collection.

And what of the Warren's daughter? I was beginning to think she was of the restless undead considering Lorraine barely interacts with her while Ed doesn't  acknowledge her existence at all.

After seeing scenes of the ridiculous Amityville horror I am automatically docking this film two stars.  I may knock the rating more after seeing the rest of the film.  Amityville has suffered enough from this nonsense.  Docking this another star for the attack on Dr Steven Kaplan who called this as he saw it early only to be defamed by the Warrens.  Read Dr Kaplan's The Amityville Conspiracy if you can find a copy.  Ok, once we got past Amityville, the movie was quite good.  I will up it back to three stars.

7767280,2,B01GRU5CQS,"A co-worker knows I enjoy horror, and told me to watch The Enfield Haunting on Hulu. I never got around to it, so when The Conjuring 2 came out, and I saw that it was about the same hauntings in England, I was optimistic that this would be good. Unfortunately, for me, it was just okay.

I thought I had watched the first Conjuring, but couldn't remember anything about it. So thats never a good sign. I should have thought about this before watching the second one. There was nothing wrong with the movie, it just did nothing for me.

Spoilers Ahead, although not really because what Im going to talk about happens early on in the movie, and its just going to be vague.

The evil looking nun was there for jump scares, and to highlight the Church and that the Warrens need to defer to it when getting involved in these cases. I really didn't see what else she was needed for.

The old man in the chair was a bit creepy. Even before the hauntings began though, I would have put the chair to the curb, and painted the wall behind it, since both were disgusting.

The relationship that the Warrens had with each other was nice, and I believed the love that they felt for each other. And it amused me that they just leave their daughter when they go on these long trips. Where is she? By herself at home, with a relative. To me the daughter seemed like an afterthought.

If you are really into movies about hauntings I would say give this one a watch, but otherwise skip it.",1473984000,3,1471,4.311594202898551

James Wan once again shows why he's one of the best modern horror directors. The films is creepy, chilling & very atmospheric. The cast once again do a very good job especially Vera Farmiga & Patrick Wilson who once again do a great job playing Ed & Lorraine Warren. The basic plot is based on the Enfield Poltergeist case & includes other things I don't want to ruin for anyone who hasn't seen the film yet. The setting, mood, music, tension all come together to create what is the horror film of the year. If you liked the first Conjuring film, haunted house films or just horror films in general then its very easy to recommend The Conjuring 2. When watch on a quite, dark night it will have you checking the shadows. The features on the disc include behind the scenes, a featurette on the real life Enfield Poltergeist case, interviews, & how certain effects were done.

7767283,3,B01GRU5CQS,"The Conjuring 2 is a sequel to the 2013 box office hit. This time, paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) look into Englands Enfield haunting, a notorious 1977 case involving single mother Penny Hodgson (Frances OConnor), her four children, and an entity that targets her 11-year-old daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe). The previous owner of their home, 72-year-old Bill Wilkins (Bob Adrian), died in his favorite chair and his spirit refuses to leave, repeating again and again, This is my home!

Like the first film, the sequel intelligently and methodically tracks the Warrens as they carry out an investigation. Scientific and level-headed, they go about their work seriously, knowing their very presence can escalate danger to their clients and themselves. A horror film is helped considerably when its protagonists are not hormone-driven teenagers or people who do exactly the opposite of what rational human beings would do when encountering peril. Though horror fans might become impatient with scenes underscoring the affection between Ed and Lorraine, they do provide some depth of characterization so that the audience regards them as real people and not merely the means to elicit scares.

Director James Wan provides plenty of jump scares as well as suspenseful, eerie moments that create tension as the couple pursue their investigation. The cinematography features several sweeping wide-angle establishing shots and uninterrupted takes during the demonic possession scenes, which give the sense that we, the viewers, are participants. The movie leaves us wondering whether the events are real or an elaborate hoax, leaving open to interpretation why the Warrens have taken on such an unorthodox pursuit.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include deleted scenes and the featurettes The Enfield Poltergeist: Living the Horror and Crafting The Conjuring 2.",1473897600,,1908,5.527397260273973

You've got to understand though that I've been watching these movies for so long that I'm usually desensitized. I can't believe that I'm admitting this but this movie actually startled me especially the nun and not just the nun, the old guy kept me on the edge of my seat too. Not to mention it's a sequel. Well, I've just got to see the first one now and excited about seeing it (already planning on purchasing both). I'll spare you the whole telling you what the story is about, that's already been divulged frame by frame. Mainly the most valuable thing that I can share with you is that this movie is awesome the whole way and it's about time something came out that actually made me think wow this is truly creepy.",1473897600,,788,4.404109589041096
7767286,5,B01GRU5CQS,"I am a huge fan of Ed and Lorraine Warren and their work/contributions to the paranormal world are invaluable and immeasurable. Needless to say, I've gone to see every film based upon their careers. The Conjuring 2 regards the Enfield Portergeist case, and the movie loosely follows the events that occurred to those involved. Having read in-depth about that case/watched documentaries/other footage, I was well-versed going into this movie. The first half of the film follows the case details almost to the letter but as the film progresses, Hollywood takes over. In my opinion, the true case details are more terrifying than what the film suggested. With that being said, I still recommend this movie version as it is scary, with excellent build-ups and pacing throughout (and it does shed light onto true accounts of paranormal and demonic experiences). If it helps the reader, I consider it almost as good as the first Conjuring and all in all, it does make into my top 10 favorite horror films.",1473897600,2,999,4.9523809523809526

7767338,4,B01GRU5CQS,"After everything weve seen there isn't much that rattles either of us anymore, but this one, this one still haunts me. After investigating the possession of the Amityville house affects their lives in ways they cant shake Ed (Wilson) and Lorraine (Farmiga) Warren decide to end their career of investigation. After a similar event happens in England the church asks them to travel to the house and decide if the church should get involved. What they find is more terrifying than either has experienced but are struggling to find proof that the events are real. I was actually looking forward to this movie. I am not a big fan of horror (or more specifically gore) but I did like the first one as well as Annabelle. The type of movies that creep me out are the ones that are more psychological and feel as if they could really happen. This is one of those movies. It did get a little repetitive, but the tenseness and creepy aspects really worked throughout and the movie did make me feel uneasy at times. It is becoming clear that horror movie directed by James Wan will be tense and really what horror should be. Creepy and disturbing without cutting people up or trying to hard. The relaxed pace and feel really adds to the overall tenseness and I recommend this for horror movie fans. Overall, one of the best horror movies to come out since the original Conjuring.

My family and I think this movie was better than the first Conjuring which we also thought was very good. My 12yr old son hid behind his blanket and sometimes watched the movie through his camera on his phone because he was so scared. I think the thought of the movie being based on a true story makes it even scarier. I, personally liked that they gave you more of an inside story on Ed and Lorraine Warren and the love that they shared. Just all around a great movie. I'm hopefully for a Conjuring 3!

I am a hardcore horror fan but this movie was disappointing!
My 11 year old daughter was not even fazed by the ""horror scenes"". What a let down!!!

***Spoiler Alert***

Janet is haunted by an old man - the thing that I hated was that we could only hear the change of voice but we are never shown the face. Janet drinks water to prove to us that she is not speaking but I was not convinced! Every time that Ed spoke to the old man, Janet asked them to look away (was he a shy ghost???). That was just annoying because it would have made sense if we saw him and not just heard him.

7767446,4,B01GRU5CQS,"It's hard to make an effective horror movie sequel as the initial appeal is diminished, but ""The Conjuring 2"" manages to overcome the problems associated with making a sequel. What's more, it's difficult to make a horror movie whose ""true story"" has been pretty much thoroughly discredited. How the movie goes about it is by wrapping the narrative with problems the Warrens supposedly had. It seems as if the story is told not from a ""this happened, then this happened"" angle but more from a theatrical one, and that's where it's most strong. The performances are great, and the direction by James Wan (whose products I personally don't like except for ""The Conjuring"" brand) is inspired and richly visual. He knows how to get the most effective shot possible without showing his hand too early which is a great step up from his previous efforts where there would be a great mood set and then have it ruined by something ridiculous happening. If you're curious as to what I mean, I'm referring to the ""lipstick demon"" in ""Insidious.""

I mentioned that the ""true story"" has been discredited. Despite if you agree or not, the movie actually includes a small part of that as a vital plot point. The main portion is that Lorraine's vision from the first is haunting her as is a demon dressed mockingly as a nun. She decides that for their safety, they shouldn't take any more cases for the time being. Naturally, there is a bizarre case in Enfield, England which calls for their expertise, and they decide they can't turn it down. Lorraine says that they will go in and investigate, but as soon as danger strikes they will be out of there. She doesn't exactly stay true to this during the movie as it shows that her empathy helped blind her from danger, but would the movie be as scary if it were safe?

I gave it four stars instead of five although I actually liked this sequel better than the original. While the original had some great scares and fantastic mood, I found the ending to be rather ridiculous and the movie slightly inconsistent. The ending here is quite powerful, and the movie feels like it's going in a singular direction rather than trying to include everything James Wan apparently admires about the Warrens. There is a very sweet scene where Ed does an Elvis impersonation for the family while playing guitar which is necessary to the soul of the movie. It doesn't want to merely terrify you but make you really care about these characters. It also proves that Patrick Wilson could effectively headline a biopic about Elvis.

Like comedies, horror movies are best if you don't give away the juice of the movie, meaning that writing a review that tells you all the funny parts of a comedy isn't helpful as is writing a review giving away all the scary parts of a horror film. Even if you haven't watched the first, I imagine that this movie will still be effective to watch even for the uninitiated. It may be a little too long by 20 or so minutes in hindsight, but I can't think of much to cut. James Wan has made the movie he wanted to make with subject material he adores with the best skill I feel he has presented so far in his career. Horror fans won't be disappointed, and those wanting a good story in the structure of a horror film will find that here.",1473033600,3,3278,4.561969439728353

I rarely give a 5 star, but wish I could have given a 4 and half at least except for there being bits and pieces missing and some over acted and under acted tiny portions of this wonderfully horrifying account of again, "" Good verses Evil "".

I appreciate the fact that the tired, overdone CGI effects are used very little here. Instead, we have a superior ghost story told with goose bump inducing skill. Acting, atmosphere, direction and creep factor are all strong here. This is one of the better horror films around and a Director to watch.

 Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson return as Lorraine and Ed Warren, who travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirits. Love the fact that the film begins in Amityville and that premise alone would make an interesting movie on it's own. If I have to say anything critical, it's that the film could be a tad shorter.",1472601600,13,801,4.714285714285714
7767500,3,B01GRU5CQS,"The first Conjuring movie almost felt old-fashionedly refreshing with its standard creaks and jump scares.  The sequel wants to seem so scary that its prelude is the Amityville house haunting, which is meant to forebode just how terrifying the Enfield case is supposed to be.

Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren, the nice couple (based on the real life couple) who go to demonic houses the way some couples go to Kiwanis Club meetings.  After the horrifying Amityville case, theyve sworn off getting involved in possessed homes (Lorraine has recurring visions of a demon nun killing Ed, which maybe wouldnt be a problem if Ed didn't paint the damn figure to start with).  But they are drawn into the famous case of the Enfield home outside of London, where youngest daughter Janet is showing some dispiriting signs of possession.  Along with all the furniture.

At the request of the Catholic Church (who apparently don't want to get involved with demonic possessions until they're proven real, for fear of bad public relations), The Warrens shack up in the flat with the family, barely held together by a single mom (Frances OConnor), and the plagued Janet (a wonderful performance from New Orleans native Madison Wolfe).  Some nice neighbors have taken in her sister and two brothers, and paranormal investigator Maurice Gross is there to witness, as well as the prerequisite debunker, Anita Gregory (played by Franka Potente).

Director James Wan, who helmed the original film and a Fast and Furious movie or two, knows how to ratchet up the suspense and cast an ominous gloom over a scene, but the payoff of too many scenes is predictable and punctuated with a soundtrack shriek or camera trickery.  Fans of the horror genre (possessed houses) will not find much new to raise their spirits.  Still, theres enough atmosphere and good performances that its enjoyable on its own terms.

CLICHES: A makeshift Ouija board; creepy childrens toys.  Another perfectly innocuous child's tune This Old Man is given the creepy treatment.
SURPRISES: Apparently Marilyn Manson makes a return as the demon nun! (It wasn't really Manson, but it was fun to think that).  Elvis songs soothe evil spirits.

7767509,3,B01GRU5CQS,"Following his diversion into Fast & Furious land, James Wan is back doing what he clearly loves most, and that is scaring the crap out of audiences. The Conjuring 2 is Wan's latest horror turn behind the camera, and what's fascinating about him is that he shows something different each time. Wan is a long way from the torture porn of Saw (which he created, let's not forget), and The Conjuring movies are different from what he does in Insidious. This time around he's indulging in not just one legendary case of real-life terror, but two of them: Amityville followed by the Enfield Poltergeist. That amount of supernatural wattage will surely shock the faint-hearted and leave them sleeping with a night light, even if at times it appears Wan has bitten off a little more than he chew.

Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga return as actual ghostbusting duo Ed and Lorraine Warren, the latter gifted with a clairvoyance that allows her to get frightfully close to the paranormal. Picking up from where the prior film left off, they're investigating the most famous case in American history, Amityville, in an effort to prove it was more than just a random murder. While engaged in a sance, Lorraine has an out-of-body experience that literally puts her in the killer's shoes.  In this astral realm she catches a glimpse of Ed's impending death and is left spiritually scarred. What she sees causes her to retire, which Ed sees as a mistake since Lorraine's powers are a ""gift from God"".

Across the pond, a case that would become known as ""London's Amityville"" draws Ed and Lorraine off the interview circuit, where they face constant scrutiny from debunkers, and back into the field. Some old couch potato's demonic spirit is haunting the poor Hodgson family (Frances O'Connor as the mother of four) through 11-year-old daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe). Unlike the prior movie which used the '70s period to tremendous psychological effect, Wan relies on standard tricks to get by this time. A boy's tent in the middle of the hallway will become a creepy hiding place for malevolent spirits later on; a child's empty swing moving ever so gently as if someone was just there, or a toy projector with the monstrous image of The Crooked Man. The Hodgsons can't stop themselves from exploring every dark nook, and Wan takes us into the haunted recesses right along with them.

There may not be a better director than Wan at playing the audience like a finely-tuned instrument. He knows every button to press to illicit the reaction he wants, usually abject terror, but he leans heavily on jump scares more often this time than in times past. Fortunately he doesn't completely abandon the slow ratcheting up of tension, using a variety of approaches to keep audiences on the edge of their seat. Wan repeatedly plays with perspective to keep us as off-balance as his freaked out characters.

It takes a full hour before the Warrens actually arrive in England, and by then the 134-minute runtime is already looking like a bear. Returning screenwriters Chad and Carey Hayes pad things out by having the Hodgsons repeatedly make the kind of moronic decisions we expect to see in horrors not directed by Wan.  They repeatedly go where it's probably a really dumb idea to go, and even the Warrens aren't immune to doing really idiotic things when it's convenient to the plot. The one constant between Ed and Lorraine is their faith in one another and faith in God. Wilson and Farmiga remain the franchise's greatest strength; their unusual chemistry seemingly works because they don't appear to be the perfect fit.  He's a guy who occasionally grabs a guitar and breaks out into a rendition of Elvis' ""Can't Help Falling in Love with You"", and she...well, she sees dead people. As the primary victim of the evil spirit's possession, Madison Wolfe captures Janet's confusion, sadness, and emotional fatigue. The only bit of weird casting was Franka Potente (of Run Lola Run and 'Bourne' fame) as one of many who believes the Hodgsons are pulling an elaborate hoax. In reality there were quite a few who felt this way, and the film makes sure just enough of their voice is heard. It's probably wisest not to go in thinking you're going to get the full picture of the real-life case, because the film only works under the belief that demonic spirits who throw furniture and inhabit the bodies of young girls are real. The Conjuring 2 has genuine scares but they don't quite shiver you to the bone the way the last film did.",1470182400,7,4506,4.806451612903226

Screenwriters: Carey Hayes, Chad Hayes, James Wan, and David Leslie Johnson

Cast: Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Madison Wolfe, and Frances OConnor

Sequels are often accompanied with a been there, done that sort of feeling.  While, that does not seem to prevent them from being successful, it does prevent many of them from being great.  The Conjuring 2 is been there, done thats latest victim.

Set in late 1970s North London, The Conjuring 2 reunites us with paranormal investigators Ed and Loraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farminga).  Still reeling from their involvement investigating New Yorks gruesome Amityville murders in 1974, the Warrens are considering a hiatus from the demon-hunting game.  However, when the Church approaches them with a story about a family in England possibly plagued by an evil spirit, the Warrens reluctantly agree to check it out.

This film, like its predecessor is also based on the case files of the Warrens and follows a rather highly publicized case known as the Enfield Poltergeist. Any freshness carried over from the 2013 original about a couple and their five daughters tormented by an evil presence is abandoned in this follow up about a mother and her four children tormented by an evil presence.  Its not that this is just another film about a haunting; its been proven that there can be countless good and bad films that pursue that theme.  Its that The Conjuring 2 doesnt really advance the narrative of these characters or reveal any depth to the uncertainty of its source material.  In the same way that a television series might be developed for a network, but then the studio makes a deal to tie it to an already proven property in order to reap an existing audience, The Conjuring 2 feels like a Mad Libs horror movie script and the studio slapped The Conjuring 2 on top of it.  Heres how I imagine the films four screenwriters credited on this film developed the script:

Carey Hayes: A demonic force is contacted through a (noun).

Chad Hayes: Ouija board.

James Wan: The children then are frightened when their bed (verb and adverb).

David Leslie Johnson: Shakes uncontrollably.

All of this is highly disappointing given how much I enjoyed The Conjuring in 2013. A redemptive piece of good news is that regardless of how dull the script is, director James Wan will not disappoint when it comes to delivering scares.  While the scares this time around are arguably cheaper than those in the previous film, there are a few good ones and some nightmare worthy moments as well.  I do believe that James Wan is the most interesting director of horror working right now.  His style is unique, and his skill with the genre is technically rather brilliant.

Overall though, The Conjuring 2 is a sophomore slump for the franchise, and I say franchise because I don't think were quite done with the Warrens; the good will earned in the first film is not entirely used up yet.  Still, the second entry represents the fine line that stands between a fresh, vibrant, and chilling horror film and a cheap, by-the-numbers, retread of what weve seen before. C+

The Conjuring was very good and The Conjuring 2 was a step behind the first installment. The NUN in this movie was the creepiest image I have ever seen I know this because days after watching the movie I still think about the scene when the NUN appears in the Warrens house. I'm a Christian and believe in angels/demons so I suppose this made me even more scared. Good movie.",1467763200,,630,4.302521008403361
7767517,4,B01GRU5CQS,"When the film opens, we find Ed and Lorraine Warren in the Amityville Horror house, where Lorraine has a horrific visions and wants to swear off any more cases. It isn't long before the Amityville case becomes considered a hoax, resulting in many disbelieving the Warrens. In England, a single mother and her children become the target of an entity whose prime focus is her 11-year-old daughter. Hesitant, Ed and Lorraine investigate the case, encountering the supernatural in ways they never experienced.

The original film is one of the few to really scare me during my theater experience, I was startled numerous times, and my heart was pounding through a great amount of the film. While there are things in the sequel that are improved on in the sequel, there are also things that I feel didn't quite work. For one thing, I was not impressed with the length at 2 hours and 15 minutes. I cant say it wasn't boring, but I found myself thinking that it needs to wrap up already. I can understand that they really wanted to develop the characters this time around, and they certainly did, but I felt they went a tad overboard. The family was really likable and you felt sorry for them, but there is only many aww moments you can use before you start thinking okay, we get it, were supposed to feel sorry for them. Had it shaved at least 20/25 minutes off, it would have been more satisfactory.

What I did like about this film is that it really gave focus to Ed and Lorraines relationship as well as them as people, while still giving plenty of time with this new family. In a moment where Ed plays music for the family in hopes of cheering them up, as cheesy as it was, it was a genuinely nice moment that really made you love the characters, and you can sense the love between Ed and Lorraine just from the looks they give each other (thanks to fantastic performances by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson). Though what semi-hurt the film for me was that the scariness felt much to familiar. While there were some nice and creepy moments, I felt this film relied way too much on jump scares that have been done to death in other supernatural films. The use of cgi and special effects were also something that didn't work for it. Any actual scary moments in this film were done completely without this. For example, there was a scene with Lorraine and this painting that gave me the creeps and had me on edge. Small moments like this can do a lot. As for the story itself, it was still engaging and I enjoyed how it toyed with how people perceive the paranormal has a hoax. In a twist towards the end involving how the haunting is happening, it felt really far-fetched, but hey, if thats what happened in the real case, who am I to question it? I should also add that is amazingly filmed and uses many filming techniques to make certain scenes scarier, one involving a hallway in Ed and Lorraines house gave me huge chills (even if it reminded me of another particular movie involving a hallway).

As stated above, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farming knock it out of the park with their performances in this one and really bring much more humanity to Ed and Lorraine, the chemistry is extremely believable, and their own performances are perfect and feel genuine. However, it is newcomer Madison Wolfe who provides the best performance of the film as Janet, the prime target of the entity. In moments where Janet is showing grief, loneliness, and helplessness Wolfe really knows how to break hearts and make you want to comfort her. But in the moments where she plays off possession, it really came off as scary and shocking to where she could give Linda Blair a run for her money. The behavior is just intense and you are in disbelief that not only a child, but this newcomer could pull off something as grand as this.

While the film didn't provide the scares and horror I felt during the first film, and it runs an excessive length, it is still a satisfactory sequel with an engaging case story, characters, excellent cinematography, and performances to make it a worthy sequel and entry in the supernatural genre.",1467676800,2,4111,4.56639566395664

7767525,2,B01GRU5CQS,"Why does Hollywood keep doing this crap? I did not see this film as an improvement over the last one. Here are Pros and Cons:
Pros:
1) Gives quick jump scares. I'll hand it to the producers when it comes to the timing and setting as the props were good enough. The movie did a fairly good job at portraying 1970s London with their wardrobe and houses.
Cons:
1) Nothing New- seriously? Same elements of Ouiji Board, ghosts, spirits, demonic possession, a priest always being involved, haunted house, foolish dumb kids. Sound familiar enough? If you want to see a real classic movie of this sub genre then go watch the actual Exorcist movie becuase that movie is original acting with good build up and literally paved the road for these wannabe movies that disgrace the horror genre.
2) Movie fails to connect the trilogy series with the Annabelle and first Conjuring movie. From every movie series, I expect a strong connection with the movies. The only time this movie connects with the previous movies is during the end when the crooked man machine is placed in the museum next to the other previously seen haunted artifacts BUT even that ending is so vague. Sure the ending is ambiguous but it doesn't even leave me caring about the ending itself. Instead I'm sitting in the theatre glad that the movie is done wasting my time.
3) The plot line has so many holes and unanswered questions. A weak script can never replace mystery and thrill a horror movie should give. There is a definitive line between ambiguity and a weak script. This film has a a very vague script with extremely predictable acting. The movie's big budget cannot even cover up how horrible this movie is.
I really hope this is the last film of the series because the idea of ghosts, priests, haunted homes, demonic possession, and Ouiji boards are getting boring and very old. Horror films should make me see through the character's lenses and be afraid. Instead, I spend almost 2 hours pitting the character's stupidity.",1466640000,3,1993,4.713467048710601

I don't want to get into the plot details, as those are what makes this movie a joy, but I do want to touch on a few things about the movie.

1.) Yes the movie is noticeably long.  Don't make immediate plans for after you see this movie.  You will enjoy it more if you don't have to think about how long it is and you are able to surrender your imagination over to it.

2) Don't fall into the ""bigger an better"" mindset that ruins horror sequels.  A lot of people who were disappointed by this movie all say the same thing: ""It did out do the first movie"" (or something to that effect).  Here's the fact of the matter, I don't thing that's what they are trying to do.  I think they were just trying to make another truly great horror moving about the Warrens.  They succeeded in that.

7767529,4,B01GRU5CQS,"Theatrical review. Possible spoilers. I was a big fan of the original film, also directed by James Wan. Im not a big fan of horror movies that provide cheap jump scares. Even little kids know how to do that. In the original The Conjuring, the film was propelled by legitimate tension and suspense along with a jump scare on occasion. I thought it was one of the better films of its genre.

Here we have the same ghost hunters, Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), who are consultants for the Catholic Church. Lorraine has had enough of using her special powers that she wants a break. Across the pond in rural England, the Hodgson family is finding life a bit disturbing. Based on actual reports, the 1977 events are elevated to the Church and it asks the Warrens to take a look. Reluctantly they go and of course, it all seems to be real. Or is it.

Lorraine doesnt feel the evil that is suggested by the family headed by single mother Peggy (Frances OConnor). She has 2 daughters and 2 sons and have been deserted by their father. The youngest girl, Janet who is about 12, is portrayed by Madison Wolfe (Keanu) who is excellent. She becomes the primary target for the hobgoblin who infests the house. Wan is much more reliant on sharp violin attacks, loud knocks on doors and heavy foot steps to scare you this time around. Yes, there are some tense moments, especially when Ed goes into a flooded basement to find out where the leak is. But we know something is going to happen and so are just thinking about when its going to happen.

The film has some terrific special effects and is elevated by fine acting by all concerned including Lauren Esposito as older daughter Margaret, Simon McBurney as a TV personality and family ally, Maria Doyle Kennedy as a concerned neighbor and Franka Potente as a skeptical journalist. The ""Conjuring 2"" is better than most horror films out there these days, but doesnt hold up to the original. Primarily because it resorts more to the traditional way of frightening the viewer.",1466467200,8,2039,4.6115702479338845

Besides a few missteps ( Saw, Dead Silence and for some insane reason Furious 7) he has made and produced some of the best horror films since the 80s (Insidious 1-3, Annabelle,  The Conjuring and the glorious Conjuring 2). Insidious 1 scared me the most out of all of those but Conjuring 2 is by far his best made film yet. It shows this guy can really direct the whole package and not just excellent scares.  I was mesmerized through the entire 134 min runtime. So much so that I stuck around for the entire end credits. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga knock it out of the park again with their excellent performances as well as the rest of the cast in an extremely well acted horrror film. Its also a gorgeous looking horror film as well. The locations and Cinematography are outstanding.

The opening sequence at Amityville before the title sequence was probably the scariest thing of the film.  Patrick and Vera do a good job but the movie felt stale and flat for the most part.  Plus, the movie runs a little too long.  Maybe if Mr. Wan cut a lot of unnecessary scenes like Patrick's character playing Elvis on the guitar, yup it happens, the movie would've been better.  So, not as good as the 1st one but way better than that awful Annabelle movie, the 1st one.  Mr. Wan probably should've shown some of the real evidence of the case during the end credits too.  Something was just missing in this chapter.  But, I'll be there for the next one.  I don't know why this movie was rated ""R"" too.  Nothing gratuitous or graphic.  Just some intense scenes and a lot of kids screaming.",1466208000,7,883,4.259036144578313

7767535,4,B01GRU5CQS,"Theatrical review.  Possible spoilers.  I was a big fan of the original film, also directed by James Wan.  Im not a big fan of horror movies that provide cheap jump scares.  Even little kids know how to do that.  In the original The Conjuring, the film was propelled by legitimate tension and suspense along with a jump scare on occasion.  I thought it was one of the better films of its genre.

Here we have the same ghost hunters, Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), who are consultants for the Catholic Church.  Lorraine has had enough of using her special powers that she wants a break.  Across the pond in rural England, the Hodgson family is finding life a bit disturbing.  Based on actual reports, the 1977 events are elevated to the Church and it asks the Warrens to take a look.  Reluctantly they go and of course, it all seems to be real.  Or is it.

Lorraine doesnt feel the evil that is suggested by the family headed by single mother Peggy (Frances OConnor).  She has 2 daughters and 2 sons and have been deserted by their father.  The youngest girl, Janet who is about 12, is portrayed by Madison Wolfe (Keanu) who is excellent.  She becomes the primary target for the hobgoblin who infests the house.  Wan is much more reliant on sharp violin attacks, loud knocks on doors and heavy foot steps to scare you this time around.  Yes, there are some tense moments, especially when Ed goes into a flooded basement to find out where the leak is.  But we know something is going to happen and so are just thinking about when its going to happen.

The film has some terrific special effects and is elevated by fine acting by all concerned including Lauren Esposito as older daughter Margaret, Simon McBurney as a TV personality and family ally, Maria Doyle Kennedy as a concerned neighbor and Franka Potente as a skeptical journalist.  The ""Conjuring 2""  is better than most horror films out there these days, but doesnt hold up to the original.  Primarily because it resorts more to the traditional way of frightening the viewer.",1466035200,2,2059,4.6115702479338845
7767536,5,B01GRU5CQS,"The team that expertly crafted The Conjuring has produced another fine scarefest with well-developed characters, a nicely paced and suspenseful story, and convincing performances by the cast. While not quite as scary as the first--but only because it lacks the novelty of being the first--it will nonetheless give you some very disquieting dreams.",1465948800,2,347,5.566037735849057
7767537,5,B01GRU5CQS,"In a world where demonic possession movies are far from an original concept, I think James Wan delivers the goods, and pulls it off splendidly. I saw this movie last night and it was absolutely amazing. James Wan is STILL on fire, and quit frankly, so is Patrick Wilson because he is the common denominator in most of these movies. That's not to take anything away from Vera Farmiga since she plays Lorraine Warren very well, so kudos to her. I was not disappointed at all. Every time I think his movies can't get any creepier, James Wan, always tops himself. In this day and age, it's very hard to make movies even remotely scary, but somehow he always manages to pull off the scenes that have the audience practically jumping out of their skin. I loved all 3 Insidious movies, Annabelle (although some hated it), and the first Conjuring film. Forgive me if I offend anyone by saying this, but he may be the next ""master of horror"" in my opinion. The first Conjuring started off kind of slow, but when it picked it, it knocked your socks off. This one jumps right into the action by starting off with horrific events of The Amityville Horror, and it NEVER loses its momentum. I didn't get bored once.

The Conjuring 2 is about the legendary, and highly respected, Ed and Lorraine Warren. It's based off another case they worked on after The Amityville Horror, and it takes place in Enfield, England. This story is supposed to be the British counterpart to the Amityville Horror. The movie starts with an 11-year-old girl by the name of Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe) who is living with her mother Peggy (no father in the picture), and her 3 siblings. Inevitably, once it's revealed that she and a friend from school have created a makeshift ouija board, you can tell that things are going to go from bad to worst for this little girl who thinks this is just a ""game.""

While this movie had some predictable aspects, please, do not assume that you already know what's going on. Trust me, there are quite a few surprises. Those surprises are what sets this apart from other ""possession"" movies. Don't get me wrong, this is clearly a classic story of good vs. evil, and that point is driven home many times throughout the film. However, it offers a lot more since there is also media frenzy involved, and of course there are tons of skeptics as it comes into question whether or not Janet is actually possessed, or if this is a scheme cooked up by her mother to gain attention and she is actually faking it. Ed and Lorraine even start to doubt whether or not a possession is actually taking place, or if Janet is suffering from a form of psychosis.

I don't want to give the entire movie away, but you must pay attention to get the gist of the story before you decide which malevolent spirit is really pulling the strings because The Crooked Man is also involved. Who knew demons could be so clever? On another note, maybe I'm just a big softy, but I found the demonic nun the scariest thing I've seen in a while. I'm sure that certainly p*ssed a lot of Christians off. Add to that, the repetitive playing of The First Noel which only adds to the eerie and creepy atmosphere of the whole movie and you are guaranteed to be scared. Personally, I don't think I'll ever hear this song quite the same way again.

I also thought it was extremely clever to show the Warrens older daughter in this movie, who has clearly inherited her mother's gift. I think that was a nice touch and a preliminary of possible things to come in the upcoming movies. At any rate, I see a lot of great things happening there. All in all, I was very pleased with the film, although I don't think I'll be watching it again any time soon. At least not alone anyway. I definitely can't wait to see the next James Wan film for I am truly amazed by such a talented Director, which is rare these days. For the first time, in a long time, I feel like this was money well spent instead of money wasted. A lot of these new releases have been trash lately, but I left the movie theater very satisfied this time instead of feeling cheated. It was worth it!!",1465862400,3,4116,4.447682119205298
7767538,2,B01GRU5CQS,"Janet, a regular little girl, is suddenly plagued with hearing voices and sounds at night. As time goes on, the incidences get more and more violent with she and her sister being thrown around the room. Eventually, the ghost speaks through her and her family feels unsafe staying in the house. Leaving isn't an option since it follows them. First they go to the police and then the church, who employs the help of famous ghost hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren. Unfortunately, they have already been targeted by an evil force.

I hated the first Conjuring movie but I held hope that the sequel would be better. The Conjuring 2 is a mediocre horror film, but miles better than its predecessor. It features a formulaic haunted house/possession horror film. The real strength of the film is in the character building and the acting. I felt for Janet and her family. Her mom is a single parent struggling to provide for her children with no other support other than a neighbor. These supernatural events put great strain on an already stressed family and it was heartbreaking to watch. Ed and Lorraine Warren have a family of their own built on faith and love. The faith part is a bit in your face and obnoxious, but their love is apparent because of the skill and chemistry between Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. They care absolutely for each other and the people they help. Both of these family dynamics are what made the film at all entertaining.

Unfortunately, quite a few things didn't work for me. First and foremost, I have a problem providing exploitative charlatans like the Warrens any sort of positive publicity. I find them morally reprehensible. Their portrayal in the film is well acted, but flatly perfect and boring. Their faith is portrayed hamhandedly instead of as an organic part of their character. The obvious notion that they and the Enfield poltergeist could be fake is brought up in passing, but discredited quickly by having the accusers not be as charismatic or nice as the couple. The writer could have at least given the Warren's credible argument at least for Amityville, but it amounted to ""you weren't there"" and namecalling. It may not be as entertaining, but I'd like someone to make a movie where they are shown as the frauds they are in reality rather than the perfect ghostbusting couple they are in this film.

The story doesn't bring anything new or interesting. It stays securely in the established tropes of the possession and haunted house genres. The horror aspects are lacking, mostly relying on numerous (I counted 13) jump scares without building up any actual atmosphere or suspense. These cheap scares give the audience an involuntary jolt, which is fine used sparingly with atmosphere or tension. After a few, they lose effectiveness and show that the filmmakers aren't interested in constructing an effective film. The film also relies a lot on CGI creatures and actors with brightly colored contact lenses. Both come off as cheesy and brought me out of the film. The demon nun creature in particular came off as Marilyn Manson in a nun outfit rather than a blasphemous demon. A particular scene with her and a painting started out as a bit creepy and then descended into goofiness. The Crooked Man creature is well designed, but not well created or used. Showing too much of the monsters shows all of their flaws, Some scenes go on way too long and an odd Elvis moment made the pacing drag. The ending is super sappy and completely out of character.

The Conjuring 2 is not quite as bad as the first, but the construction of the film is a mess. The characters are well acted and sympathetic, but the Warrens come off as too perfect. The horror elements had potential, but came off as cheesy and cheap. James Wan had a couple of good films at the beginning of his career. Now, he continues to pump out underwhelming, forgettable films filled with jump scares. I'm happy that horror is thriving as it dominated the box office opening weekend. I just wish that original films that play with tropes and have original ideas were in theaters rather than the same formulaic ones over and over again,",1465862400,5,4139,4.7604456824512535
7767539,5,B01GRU5CQS,"It has been a long time since a horror movie has given me shivers if not the chills for a long time.  Sure there have been some great movies but again everything has been used (the genes, creatures, etc.) so its the terror and thrillers are never there however this movie brings back the horror and thrills knowing that the case files and facts if not all of the people portray in the movie is real.  The jump scares are perfectly timed to keep up thrill and horrors telling the audience how exactly what they are going through.",1465776000,5,528,4.377551020408164
7767540,4,B01GRU5CQS,"As the movie season enters into the Summer, movie-goers are hungry for a satisfying horror movie. Up until now Hollywood has struggled in that department; that is until James Wan announced last year that he would return to the world of horror after finishing up Fast and Furious 7. And with production coming to a close, he would announce that The Conjuring 2 would indeed be his next project and continue the case studies of Ed and Lorraine Warren. After a rousing success with the original 2013 hit and a less then stellar spin-off in Annabelle, fans are clamoring to see the franchise return to form with James Wan directing the sequel. So with that in mind, did The Conjuring 2 live up to the hype of the original? Maybe so, but thats nothing to knock at as it truly has a strong footing.

With the return of Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson in their leading roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren, they venture out into one of the most diabolical cases in history as the Hodgson family in Enfield England experience terror as a spirit slowly destroys the lives of a mother and her four kids. As the mystery goes deeper and sanities begin to reach a breaking point, Ed and Lorraines spirits are tested and could potentially lead to their end. The film also stars Madison Wolfe, Frances OConnor, and Simon McBurney.

Having seen the original film I was a huge fan and it really catapulted James Wans career as a horror director. What made the original so great was the focus put on the characters and you actually caring about them when things go bad. Also, the cinematography was what really stood out as it built tension and suspense. Some may criticize the children in the first Conjuring for being annoying but shouldnt be at fault as most of the attention was put on the mother, played by Lili Taylor, as she slowly became possessed by the demonic spirit of the evil witch. Where the first movie may have struggled, the sequel rights itself as the children become the focal point.

Theres a lot to appreciate in The Conjuring 2 as most of whats liked is in the little details. Without giving anything away in spoilers, in the opening of the film we get another introduction to a case study; however this time being where the last movie left off with Ed and Lorraine Warren venturing to Rhode Island and visiting the Amityville home. This to me was a great opening to the movie as we got to see a glimpse into one of the most well-known and most publicized hauntings that would then get into the hands of Hollywood. With the right amount of attention and focus the movie doesnt spend too much time on the Amitvyville story; rather it builds into the paranormal events that we would then see in the Enfield case. The wrongs that most films do is done right by James Wan and his abilities to not sway away from conventional wisdom. Weve already been introduced to the Amityville story with numerous films and what Wan succeeds in is not retelling a story thats been done time and time again.

As for the focal point of the movie with Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe) being manipulated by the evil entity, Wolfe does an amazing job. Not only do you care for her as she tries to prove everyone wrong, but she also has that innocence that most kids would have at a young age. Most of the time in movies people are cast without thought of how they are perceived by audiences. This can sometimes lead to a disconnect; especially when they are in a lead role. There even has to be praise for Frances OConnor who plays the mom as she delivers a good performance as she tries to keep her children safe when the media begins to come into the picture.

The casting was superb in this film which leads us to another strong performance by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. Their chemistry together is seamless and leads us into rooting for them when things turn upside-down. Even when the media begins to question their beliefs and close encounters with the paranormal, they may start to rethink a continuing venture into the unknown but doesnt stop them when the Hodgson family come into the picture. Theres a moment when the importance of family is brought into play and how togetherness is what will prevail anyone or anything from tearing them apart. With overall satisfaction, we can potentially see future sequels of Ed and Lorraine Warren and their case studies as Wilson and Farmiga have become the staple of the franchise.

Now its not to say that the movie doesnt have its flaws as the scares we got from the original don't quite live up here. The first movie was atmospheric with dread; however, here we have a combination of Insidious and Conjuring effects. The movie says the Enfield case is the most diabolical of them all but I would beg to differ by saying the first movie lived up to that monicker. In The Conjuring 2 its more so a poltergeist where a spirit haunts the home and isn't afraid to reveal itself to the outside world. The movie does have tension and some visually terrifying moments that only showcase the strengths of James Wan who knows how to respect the horror genre without resorting to violence as most horror films now-a-days falls victim to. So going into The Conjuring 2 you will notice a slight difference in the scares which only benefits the film from falling into retread territory.

After all that was said and all has been seen, The Conjuring 2 is a solid sequel to James Wans original. Though it may not live up to the original, it definitely makes up for it with strong performances and a spooky tale to be told. Where most sequels fail, Warner Bros. and James Wan do justice and only promises more sequels to follow if and when The Conjuring 2 leads to a box-office success.",1465776000,3,5703,4.5634765625
7767541,4,B01GRU5CQS,"We continue on with the paranormal adventures of Ed (Patrick Wilson ) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren of Amityville fame. They are asked to go to Enfield and investigate a haunting or poltergeist case centering around Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe) and the spirit of Bill.

The film is filled with jump scares, whispers, screams, etc. enough to make it enjoyable.

Much of the film follows reported incidents (a bit exaggerated) and the criticism and skepticism of the time (and today). Claims that Janet did the pranks and practiced ventriloquism as well as being caught red handed faking incidents are included in the feature. The film makers took liberties with reports such as the police report that a chair wobbled from side to side, became a chair moving across the room. The role of Ed and Lorraine was minor and I would suggest the reason why they never wrote about it was that until the last half hour of the film, they deemed it a hoax and that last part was Hollywood writers earning their dime. As an entertaining Poltergeist film, it is all that. As to being factual, there have been other films and features on Enfield that are far less horrific and supernatural.

Go watch the film for a good scare for the kids, not a docudrama.

7767542,5,B01GRU5CQS,"This movie reminded me of the great, great Sam Raimi trilogy - ""Evil Dead"", ""Evil Dead 2"" and ""Army of Darkness"". The male lead made those funny facial expressions similar to Bruce Campbell with lots of exaggerated grunts and groans. When he sings and plays Elvis' ""I Can't Help Falling In Love With You"" on the guitar, I thought ""JAMES WAN IS A GENIUS !!!!!!!!!"" Elvis died just about the same time these events actually occurred. GENIUS!!!!!! I think that Elvis' spirit was being channeled through the character played by the male lead. The female lead delivered her lines with true somnolence. She must have really practiced a lot for this role. The demons made lots of screams and howls. AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA !!!! THIS IS MY HOUSE !!!! AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA !!!! I had to cover my eyes the entire movie - just kept open a tiny slit between the fingers to see what was going on. Was too scared to go to the wee-wee room.

It was refreshing to finally see a truly creepy, unnerving supernatural horror movie again. Based on the reviews, we thought the 2nd Conjuring would be an excellent follow-up to the first movie; it was honestly garbage. Between the singing (can't eyeroll hard enough here), the grumpy old man ghost yelling ""MY HOUSE!"" (oh how we laughed), the needlessly long conversations the Warrens had with him (they should have kept them short - would've been much more effective), and the absolutely wretched dialogue, I was laughing my ass off most of the movie instead of getting into it. My fiance just kept shaking his head as every ridiculous, corny, trying-too-hard scene came to pass. The beginning wasn't bad - I felt the seance with Mrs. Warren reliving the Amityville murders through the eyes of the killer was a good start, and was looking forward to the rest of the movie.
