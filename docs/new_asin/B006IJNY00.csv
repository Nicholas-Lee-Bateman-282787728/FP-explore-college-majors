Anyone who knows the work of Eytan Fox (Walking on Water, Yossi and Jagger, Yossi, and The Bubble) will delight in this TV musical miniseries he made several years ago. A gay young man, Meir, heads for Tel Aviv in search of the mother who abandoned him when he was young and soon finds his singing talents put to use at a popular drag club, where he becomes a star using his mother's nickname, Mary Lou. His best female friend Shuli visits him, and problems ensue when both find themselves loving the same man, Gabi, who is secretly attracted to Meir, but too closety to face possible social ostracism.  Another friend, a drag entertainer named Uri or ""Miss Sunshine"" has similar problems when he falls for a rough-trade taxi driver, who only finds Uri acceptable when he is in full drag. The songs of Svika Pick, a popular Israeli songwriter, are used throughout and complement both comedic and dramatic elements.",1419465600,,971,4.678362573099415
8498706,5,B006IJNY00,"In this amusing musical, two friends, a young man and a young woman, are in love with the same man.  The music is great and the film is unique, since Israeli film makers haven't made many musicals. In one fell swoop, this move breaks many steriotypes about sexuality, modern Israelis, and Israeli films.",1367107200,4,303,4.716981132075472
