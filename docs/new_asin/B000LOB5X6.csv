2711046,5,B000LOB5X6,"I had rented this movie and decided I had to own it.  what a wonderful love story.  The dancing and music are incredible.  Although it is sad, I watch this movie when I want to escape from normal problems.  I listen to the CD when I want to relax.",1218844800,2,247,3.979591836734694
2711047,5,B000LOB5X6,"Having been a fan of the 1981 classic starring Rekha in the title role, I wasn't sure what to expect, but was more than staisfied by the amazing performances in this movie. The story centers around an aging courtesan Umrao Jaan Ada who tells her life story to another poet through a series of flashbacks.

The title character is played to convincing effect by Aishwarya Rai. It is not just her luminous beauty that shines through here - every facial expression, the lift of an eyebrow, her smile, her tears, are all beievable in conveying her character's emotions. The dance sequences were also very good - I never thought of Aishwarya as a great dancer until this movie, the movements are so natural, and authentic. Rekha, in the original was an amazing dancer too, and both in their own unique ways bring the character of Umrao Jaan to glorious life on screen.

Umrao Jaan's love interest, Nawab Sultan is played convincingly by Abshishek Bachchan, and their on-screen chemistry practically sizzles [they are now a real-life married couple]. Each love scene is beautifully and subtly done, and comes across as tender with an underlying passion that is hard to miss.

There are also secondary characters in this movie that deserve mention - namely, the brothel owner, Khanum Sahib, played by veteran actress Shabana Azmi. Her character's greed for wealth is also touched by some shred of humanity, and very well done. Sunil Shetty plays the dacoit who lusts after Umrao, and his character comes across as savage and ruthless whilst also tender when faced by Umrao's dazzling beauty and finesse.

The songs are all beautiful, and the costumes and sets simply sumptuous. This is definitely one of the best Bollywood musicals to come along, enhanced by a compelling plot and credible acting. Highly recommended period piece!",1200355200,30,1822,4.963934426229508
2711048,4,B000LOB5X6,"I am not such a fan of Aishwarya, but her performance here is good. I still feel she comes out a little fake here and there, and granted, she can manipulate her eyes as much as technology manipulates the color of them. The worst part of the movie is Abhishek... he plays a very very lame Sultan, never seems to accomplish a genuine facial expression, and for some reason can't stand quite straight showing a hunchback. Shabana Azmi is just spectacular, as always. I am no expert in South Asian music and singing, but I am a musician and I found the music and the singer to be just exquisite! The photography is also outstanding, not to mention the perfect costumes. The dancing performances are good, but for some reason I find Aishwarya to be a little too technical with limited natural grace (I wonder how Madhuri Dixit would have uplifted this character with her limitless grace).
I think the story (without watching Rekha's version) has a strong feminist message in the sense that Shabana's character was able to attain a very powerful position in society as a lonely woman. I know I know it is a brothel, but it is supposed to be a very high-profile one! For the time, the location and the whole setting of the story, the brothel I think represents a way in which women find enourmous power, voice and independence, even more than being a respected wife. At the end, women's arms are strongest around a man's neck right? In the microcosmos of the brothel, women are protected from the cruel oppresion of outside; beautifully explained by Shabana's character. The 'love' aspect is questionnable in real life; if any, it is South Asian society which has proven that infatuation-based love does not persist as much as reason-based relationships such as arranged marriages, and love as a result of time spent together, and not butterflies in the stomach. I think women at the brothel enjoyed of more liberties (artistic preparation, fame, jewels, fine dresses, great standard of living, servitude, and the option of choosing one's sex partner) the trade-off is the reputation of course. Looking at Ameeran's mother, and at Shabana's character, I think Shabana's had a much better life overall.
Good movie, nice slow pace and very very enjoyable experience.",1199318400,,2257,4.849740932642487
2711049,5,B000LOB5X6,"This is story-telling at its finest.  Director JP Dutta deserves an Oscar, and so does Ashwarya Rai.  A few reviewers mentioned that the movie was too long or that there were too many climaxes.  Hindi films typically average 3 hours because Indian audiences really get into the story-telling and the melodramatic love themes.

Unlike a lot of Bollywood films, Umrao Jaan shows not one one streak of campiness.  The story is bittersweet and extremely poignant.  You can truly identify with Umrao Jaan's plight, but some Western audiences might miss that because they're conditioned to shorter length films and incongruency with the bright coloring.  Western films with dark themes tend to be dark overall:  dark mood, dark lighting, dark soundtrack--everything is dark.  Bollywood films don't follow this formula.  Sad films still have color to them.  Songs tend to be more melodramatic.  The characters often cry silently and part slowly from one another.  While their reactions are overtly sad, the feeling in the scene is very well conveyed.  I dabbed at my eyes a few times myself.  You don't see much poignancy in Western films lately which is a shame.

The screenplay was superb.  Talk about unlucky.  This poor lady was just kicked to the curb by nearly everyone.  At least she was able to enjoy a few moments of happiness in her troubled life.  Your heart really goes out to her.  And I liked the ending.  It was not a cheater's ending.  What a challenging role, and Aishwarya Rai mastered it!  In fact, the acting was excellent all around.  Additionally, the dancing, costumes, cinematography,  bittersweetness, and lyrics to the songs were all in line with the theme of the story.  This film was very well done and thought through.  Next to Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, this is my third favorite Bollywood film.

This film deserves at least an award or two.",1193011200,,1872,4.891373801916933
2711050,5,B000LOB5X6,"this is a stunning film -- the acting, the costumes, the direction, the lavish sets, the story, the music, the dancing, all are first rate.  i have watched it at least a dozen times already.  this is my favorite bollywood film so far.  i found the story moving and beautiful, and moved by the human condition of being an outcast of society.  prostitution is a blight in any culture, bringing shame to families, and umrao jaan's fate to live her life ""in a golden cage"" is tragic. i am glad the story wasn't cut as a couple of viewers suggested.  i found each scene relevant and was glad it covered her life including her waning years.  the movie never dragged or lulled for me at all.  her pleas with others not to treat her as an outcast because as a prostitute she dared to love was very moving.  i highly recommend this movie.  i love to see abischek and aish together, they make a beautiful couple. bravo, bravo!",1191542400,,916,4.404761904761905
2711051,5,B000LOB5X6,"I agree that this is perhaps Aishwayra Rai's finest work (and I've seen most of them).  Umrao Jaan's story is fascinating, uplifting, and heartbreaking all at the same time.  The photoggraphy, costumes, and music are spectacular.  The way the two stars express their character's love for each other, using nothing but their eyes, is sheer brilliance.",1188172800,12,350,5.214285714285714
2711052,4,B000LOB5X6,"Beautiful movie, opulent costumes and backdrops. Aishwarya looks stunning and all the actors give great performances. Lovely to watch!

It's obvious that Umrao Jaan is the center of attention throughout the movie (it basically revolves around her) but I feel it's at the expense of other characters that I wish would have been covered in more depth as they were also interesting characters in their own right. This could have easily been done while keeping Umrao Jaan in the limelight.

A few minor glitches:

I found a bit silly was how a feared and infamous dacoit like Faiz Ali could ever be careless enough to lose his weapon, and/or would fail to have another weapon handy if such an incident did occur.

The second half does move a bit slow and lose momentum and the end was a little anticlimactic.

Other than that, an enjoyable film.",1179446400,,841,4.732876712328767
2711053,5,B000LOB5X6,"Umrao Jaan had great potential to become one of the renowned classics of the world cinema, had the screenwriter and the director had the foresight to know when to end the movie.

The plot had all the tools of a successful story, well told, superbly acted both by Aishwarya Rai and Abishek Bachchan.  They excelled themselves once more, projecting a great love, that never went stale nor it lost its intensity of passion. The essence of the movie was a love story that ended in tragedy and it should have never turned into a life story. When the couple parted and she returned home, to the brothel in Lucknow that should have been the end, for anything that came after that was anticlimactic and only tried the patience of the audience.

A movie should only have one great climax scene, and that came with the crisis when Nawab Sultan disowned her.  Resolution should have followed immediately. We know that her life as we knew it ended there and possibly she became a living corpse. So why digress, diluting the effect of the climax adding another crisis scene, such as the rejection of her family?

We all know that in a society that public affection is forbidden even to this day it is obvious that she could not go home again, so why bother to show it? And the purpose of the last wedding scene where she performed escaped me.  If it was to add another song it just served to bore the viewers.

J.P. Dutta will be wise to edit the ending of the movie, making it shorter, and release it again for the sake of saving a great piece of art from permanent oblivion.

2711054,5,B000LOB5X6,This film is quite possibly Aishwarya Rai's greatest performance.  She easily holds this film together in the title role and lends an enormous dignity to the character of Umrao Jaan. She wonderfully translates the feeling of a woman who just can't fight her fate.  Beautiful piece of cinema.,1168819200,12,291,5.041666666666667
2711055,5,B000LOB5X6,"This movie was amazing. Aishwarya did a wonderful job as Umrao Jaan! Its sad that this movie did not get what it deserved at the box office- this is one of the most underrated movies. The story is a classic, so you know that there will be no flaw there- the movie lies in the acting and songs- which are amazing. Aishwarya gave an outstanding performance, the movie was very beautiful (the colors and sets are gorgeous). Aishwarya looked stunning in this movie.

2711057,5,B000LOB5X6,Indian movies are truly some of the best film in the world.  The sheer beauty and extraordinary singing of Aishwarya Rai are simply mezmering.  The romance scenes with her extremely handsome real life husband make it even more believable as you can almost touch the love they really share in this film.

2711059,5,B000LOB5X6,This movie is well written and visually stunning. The interplay between the beautiful Aishwarya Rai and her now equally handsome and awesomely sexy hubby made me blush.  They are magic on the screen. The movie showed both the sensual beauty of love (even with a courtesan) and the harsh realities of that lifestyle (even though she was forced into it). The costumes/fashion are absolutely beautiful (looking for some of those outfits now) and the set amazing. This movie reminds me of the East Indian version of Memoirs of a Geisha.

The movie was well written and beautifully acted but man was it sad... it was like she could not catch a break!! It was very interesting and worth a watch but don't expect a happy ending. I think if the love story itself had not ended on such a crummy note this movie would have been better for me and worth all the bad that she had to endure.... When there is no happy ending i want at least the love story to have been all consuming... this love story started out that way and then fizzled somewhere and made you feel like maybe he didn't deserve the loyalty that she showed. If you are a fan of Aish, you will not be disapointed.. the dancing and costumes in this are well worth a watch!",1398902400,3,809,4.1923076923076925

She excels in this trade because she is very beautiful and has sophistication all around her. She did not chose this profession but by the cruel twists of her fate over which she had no control she becomes a courtesan. The plot is beautiful. the story heart breaking and evokes sympathy for Umrao Jaan. Aishwarya Rai is outstanding as Umrao Jaan. The dances, lyrics and songs are beautiful.

2711065,5,B000LOB5X6,"Okay, so I bought the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Umrao-Jaan/dp/B00008OP57/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Umrao Jaan</a>&nbsp;starring the amazing Rekha and this one at the same time thinking I'd watch them back-to-back, but it turns out I wasn't in the mood by the time the first one was over. Not because the original was a bad film per se, (check out my review if you want to know more) it's just not a story you want to overload on unless you absolutely need to be sad for a while. Me, I didn't this month, but you never know I might next month.

I read once that this is considered Bollywood's worst remake! Now, I believe everyone has the right to their own opinions and there will always be people who consider any actor or actress as ""just a pretty face"" but I can't imagine why anyone would consider this a bad remake. If you want to see an AWFUL remake try Meg Ryan's version of ""The Women."" This is a lovely remake, especially because the story has structure, and context, unlike the original script! Because here Umrao is narrating her story to her would-be biographer (in a faithful adaptation to the novel) and thus no dangling loose end for a finale.

I flatly refuse to compare the lovely Rekha and the ethereal Miss Rai as actors. They are both artists of great ability and like all artists they each play their characters according to their own perspective, and the direction they're given. My criteria for a good performance hangs on one question... Did the actor or actress make me care about their character in this particular film? I cared about Rekha's Umrao, and I care about Miss Rai's. Both captured the character's most important attributes in their own unique styles. Both triumphed! Originally, this film was offered to both Priyanka Chopra and Kareena Kapoor! Now, I'm indifferent to Ms. Chopra, but I AM a fan of Ms. Kapoor-Khan and I SHUDDER to think of either as Umrao! Nobody can replace Rekah, but she does have an heiress and that's Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan.

Truth be told there's no lack of talent in this film. I found the supporting characters in this version infinitely more compelling and better defined. Nearly every actor touches you however briefly. Divya Dutta, has been a sentimental favorite of mine and I wish she'd been given more to do in her role as the character had in the original. But the scene stealer by far is the lovely and talented Shabana Azmi, a mercenary with a soft heart who creates a world of fantasy to shield herself and her girls from the hypocrisy and cruelty of the real one. Since I never could resist a bit of trivia it should be noted that her mother originated the role in 1981. I have to say, I think daughter put a lot more charisma and bite in her version, while in the original her mother was a tad more sentimental.

Another outstanding performance was Mr. Kulbhushan Kharbanda as Umrao's teacher and surrogate father. He would also portray Miss Rai's father again in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jodhaa-Akbar-Three-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0015B04EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jodhaa Akbar (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>. Their shared moments on screen are full of warmth and a bitter-sweet charm.

I also appreciated Puru Raaj Kumar as Gohar, a role tragically underdeveloped in the 1981 movie. Here the role is much more brutal but also more tragic. And while Mr. Naseeruddin Shah's Gohar is ultimately written as a weak and opportunistic man. Mr. Kumar's is granted more substance and a chance at redemption for his bad choices.

Mr. Sunil Shetty's portrayal as the bandit impersonating a Nawab is certainly more substantial than in the original, but unfortunately he lacks the charm and frankly the sex appeal of Mr. Babbar's portrayal in the original. That said, I liked the fact that they amped up the menacing obsession of his desire, it led to one of the best scenes in the movie.

Okay, I swear I'm not writing this next section to be mean. I like Abhishek Bachchan in interviews, I think he's funny, charming, mischievous, and it's obvious that he and his lovely wife have a great relationship in real life! Yet not once has ANY of that translated into any onscreen chemistry!

Why oh why, oh why oh why was he cast in this movie! This movie was made the same year the couple made Dhoom 2, and Guru. I keep hearing he did amazing in Guru but I wish he'd done amazing here too! Did he not get the memo that he wasn't playing Jai Dixit? I swear that's who I was seeing! I almost expected him to start wearing sunglasses. To put it bluntly he's a block of ice! No passion, no expression, it looks like he'd rather be at the dentist! He doesn't smile once, not once! Even in his moments of bliss with Umrao he's as stern and stiff as a grouchy teacher. He hits his mark, mouths his dialogue, and sulks. I tell you it's a good thing I knew the romance was doomed beforehand, otherwise I would have been rooting for it to fail.

To make matters worse I could think of four actors who would have done that role justice... Arjun Rampel, (give the man a decent script and he can do anything you need) Aamir Khan (why not go for the best? you only live once) Saif Ali Khan (charisma to BURN and a real Nawab playing a reel Nawab) and Kunal Kappor (if anyone LOOKS royal and has access to his passionate side it's him!)

No, I didn't want Hrithik Roshan, when he's with Aishwarya Rai on screen they can't break up, PERIOD!

In almost all the professional reviews they criticized the script and the length of the film. Now maybe the subtitles of the original version weren't handled properly, but I vehemently disagree. I found the story MUCH easier to follow here. The events were presented within the framework of a narrative, not randomly scattered and thrown in. We got a real ending, and I wasn't left wondering about the fate of randomly disappearing characters. Yes, it's long, but not longer than most Bollywood epics. Does it drag in places? One or two, but not nearly as badly as the original. Could the editing been crisper? Yes. But again it all made sense as a story!

The movie is exquisitely styled showing the true lavishness of Royal India and the courtesan world in ways that the original couldn't. The location shots are superb. I'm very picky about cinematography because Indian films have some of the best I've ever seen and I don't accept slouching! The images are gorgeous without being distracting, so kudos!

All in all, don't let the original malign you to this movie. See both! ENJOY BOTH! Artists fill the streets of the great cities of the world as they paint famous views that have been immortalized by the masters for generations. More than one of these views has become a masterpiece of more than one artist. It's the same with films. Yes, there are remakes that are awful, and remakes that are neither great or bad, but every once in a while a film will come along and be brilliantly remade twice or more times. Please watch with an open mind.",1385078400,3,7062,4.783429040196883

2711074,2,B000LOB5X6,"UMRAO JAAN was one of the first non-Masala Indian movies my Bollywood movie fan friends and I watched - and it almost killed our interest right then and there! I gather this is a remake of an Eighties movie, based on the life of a courtesan-turned-poetess - what it mostly seems is the life of a woman where violent history and personal sorrow happens to her as she suffers beautifully. Aishwarya Rai, being The Most Beautiful Woman In The World, can certainly manage that - but that's virtually all the film seems to ask of her, and she does a lot of it in this movie's three-hour plus running time. The only time she seems to do anything else is in her affair with a Pathan Prince (played by her future IRL husband, Abhishek Bachchan) - for a few moments, both actors seem to be enjoying themselves and the movie become more than an exquisitely-staged tableaux of...suffering....

I now understand why some consider Aishwarya Rai to be the most beautiful woman in the world (and considering how knock-you-down beautiful some Indian actresses are, that's saying something).
  She (Amiran-Umrao) proves that though sometimes life is full of disappointments, that doesn't mean you have to be one of them yourself; sometimes life is cruel, but that doesn't mean you have to become evil. Maybe the only way you can win sometimes, is to not give in and let the worst things that happen to you determine what you become in your heart.
  I don't know if it proves that great artists (singers and dancers in this case) have to suffer greatly to become great. Maybe it's like heroes: it takes tragedies to bring them out. The life depicted here is certainly tragic in the classical sense, but there is some kind of noble victory turning it to poetry of word, melody, and motion the way she does instead of ""going postal."" It's the antithesis of the more common revenge story.

  This one is a thing of beauty in several big ways.  I'll even forgive them for their very one-sided protrayal of British violence in the Sepoy Mutiny (the rebels were at least as guilty of atrocities, and set the mood from the beginning -- plenty of shame and blame all around), but at least that part was short and moved on soon.
  Bottom line: It is one to mull over and remember.
  By the way, if the name of the important historical city of ""Lucknow"" looks odd (as in too British), it's because a truer transliteration of the Hindi would be ""Lakhnao.""",1312502400,,1773,4.572784810126582
2711081,4,B000LOB5X6,"A beautiful but sad story of a courtesan played very well by Aishwarya. Can't be said of Abshishek though, I always thought his acting were rather stilted in other movies and in this one he is pretty much the same! Aishwarya danced so well and so authentically like a true classical Indian dancer. Watch this movie for Aishwarya's performance, the costumes,the story, the music scores and the dancing of course, thus earning a 4 star from me but could have been a 5 star if it wasn't for Abshishek's bland performance!",1309046400,,518,4.7032967032967035
2711082,5,B000LOB5X6,"India will bless your soul with this film as it touches the depth and beauty of love without reservation. The story of the beautiful courtesan, Umrao Jaan, is so profoundly moving that you might personally experience both impatience for a love so passionate, and conversely fear it. Delve heart first into the complex layers of the beauty of India, her mannerisms and customs, and the characters of this story, impeccably portrayed by Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan. They deserve nothing but the highest praise as they become your iridescent ambassadors into the richness of India, and to life here on this Earth-plane as we seek to find the beauty and inspiration in our own lives thru true, unconditional and unblemished love.

2711089,5,B000LOB5X6,"This movie is the most beautifully shot movie I have ever seen. (And I've seen many.)  Not ""cool"" shots or anything like that, just beautiful.  Full of color, scenery, and architecture.

Some reviews say about how great the dancing was.  I disagree.  I thought it was kinda lame.  But she's so beautiful why not focus on her face?!

It has a great story line.  Actually interesting and not fluff.  I love Bollywood movies but they do tend to be corney.  This one is not.

The soundtrack is by Anu Malik, whose music I've grown to love (The asoka soundtrack was awesome!)  And you can choose to listen to just the songs on the menu.  Still has the talking in it though.

This movie's running time is over three hours.  The audio and video is superbly done on this DVD.  No cheap crackling sound or graining picture.",1260835200,,814,4.472602739726027
2711090,3,B000LOB5X6,"The film is a remake of a 1981 Bollywood picture by the same title and both are based on the 1905 novel Umrao Jaan Ada about the life of a famous courtesan in the Indian city of Lucknow in the mid-1800s. Real-life husband and wife Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai play the romantic leads--and they are as gorgeous together onscreen as they are off. Rai's portrayal of the hapless Umrao is creditable, but Bachchan brings little to his role, other than looking dashing in period attire and staring at his co-star like he wants to devour her. The film's biggest problem, however, is the lack of strong conflicts to drive the story, as it merely recounts a long series of tragedies that devastate Umrao. Still, the movie is set in an enchanting time and place in India's history, when Lucknow's brothels were the epicenter of culture. The sumptuous costumes and traditional dances alone are fascinating. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1254009600,,1138,5.6608187134502925

similar in some ways to ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", telling the life story
of this famous courtesan and poet, and her journey of love, betrayal,
and forgiveness.
The music and dance sequences are the very best I have seen in Bollywood,
or anywhere for that matter---traditional dance, truly beautiful and
authentic music.
Gorgeous clothes, jewelry, people, locations, music, dance and story.
Abishek Bachchan is magnificent as Umrao Jaan's lover. The scenes where
their eyes first meet are electric! The scene where she first dances for
him is absolutely riveting and beautiful.

Since I love historical india and the dancing anyways I had no choice but to fall in love with this movie. I would have given 5 stars but the english subtitles are not too acurate ... I don't know, maybe this is the way it is with Bollywood movies but since this is my first one it kinda put a damper on a otherwise perfect movie to me.

2711094,4,B000LOB5X6,"I was lead by the ratings, fine actors and description to try this movie. I have been heavily into Bollywood of late.
I was disappointed in this one - not because it wasn't well done. It was but my taste, I now find, is more modern. This is more traditionally Indian in its solo female dances, presentation etc. The songs are almost entirely of the female voice and there are none of the group dances I love.
The chemistry between Ahbishek and Aishwarya is more powerful than they've often done (was this when they were dating?), and the acting throughout was excellent, yet for me there was a sameness to the movie and I found myself bored.
From the other critiques I see this is about my taste and not the movie.
So I am just posting this for others like me looking at Bollywood. If your taste is more modern and popular this may not be for you either. If you like traditional and arthouse this may be just the thing you're after -and it is well done.
Perhaps I shouldnt have made it the next one to watch after Jodha Akbar which, while having an arty historical feel I found very compelling and memorable. Perhaps that was a hard act to follow.",1225584000,2,1147,4.364485981308412
