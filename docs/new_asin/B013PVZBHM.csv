7370536,1,B013PVZBHM,"I got this from Strand Releasing, which does Independent film distribution and has many great titles.

""Mala Mala"" is the over-inflated look at a bunch of boring, egotistically dull men who dress up as women.  Vain, monotonous, and tiresome.  Most of them work as prostitutes because they say there are no other jobs, but actually, they don't want to work elsewhere because the money is better in prostitution.

Many of them have a serious case of self-identity disorder, which causes someone to seek plastic surgery constantly, like older women.  They are boring and so are their lives.

It plainly is dull.",1450742400,,608,4.97029702970297
7370537,5,B013PVZBHM,"It is I nformative, eye opening, non judge-mental, beautifully filmed, you simply want the film to go on and on and not end so soon.",1449619200,,132,4.32

8728507,5,B013PVZBHM,"SO MOVING, this is one of the most important, emotional, raw and honest portrayls that I have ever seen of the transgender community!! As a transgender man I was curious about life for our trans* community in Puerto Rico, and not only did a learn a little bit about being transgender in Puerto Rico but I was also so moved to learn about their struggle for equal rights in the workplace as well as outside of it. I have seen many movies about our transgender community and I am always looking for more, but THIS is BY FAR the best I have ever seen!!

TAN CONMOVEDOR, esta pelcula es una de las obras ms importantes, emocionales, abiertas y honestas que he visto sobre la communidad transgnera! Como un hombre transgnero, yo tena una curiosidad sobre la vida para nuestra comunidad trans* en Puerto Rico, y no slo aprend un poco sobre cmo es ser transgnero en Puerto Rico (yo soy de Arizona y Boston en MA) pero tambin aprend MUCHO sobre su LUCHA para los derechos de trabajar con igualdad y tambin para los derechos afuera del trabajo. Yo intento ver muchas pelculas sobre la comunidad transgnera como yo soy parte de ella pero EST pelcula es SOBRESALIENTE y SEGURO que es LA MEJOR que he visto!! Les felicito para una pelcula exitosa y conmovedor!!!
