5558050,5,B00B5A9FNM,"I finally had an evening to devote to watching Spies of Warsaw (via imported discs from the UK).  I found it very absorbing -- exciting, romantic, and tragic.

I know a bit about WW2 history but I'm not familiar with the novel the film is based on.  I had recently read Prague Winter by Madeleine Albright, and I knew people with numbers on their arms from the old days, so I knew something of the era and events.

As a suspense piece I really enjoyed this movie.  I had no idea what would happen next to the individual characters and I was completely drawn into following their various fates.  As a period piece, it felt authentic in terms of clothing and attitudes.  As a romance, it's credible and moving.  The only problem I see with it as a drama is that there are a large number of characters and it's a bit difficult to sort them all out at first, but once the story gets moving, it all comes together.  It's not some crummy superhero action movie, so people looking for CGI stunts and spandex may not care for it, but I would recommend it to anybody who likes romance, historical war stories and serious adult drama.",1363564800,99,1124,4.391304347826087
5558051,3,B00B5A9FNM,"The first review pretty much covers it. David Tenant IMO was not well cast in this mini series. It's a WW2 spy story that falls short for excitement.

I was really looking forward to another great WW2 story. Perhaps it was a good story but somehow it has little heart. It's very short...only 180 minutes.",1363046400,10,304,4.527272727272727
5558052,3,B00B5A9FNM,"MINOR SPOILERS:

Nothing inherently wrong with Spies of Warsaw.  However, frankly I expected more from both the BBC and as an adaptation of an Alan Furst novel.  It reminded me of the war themed mini-series of the 80's and 90's.  Long on period costumes, well coiffed actors and theme music with PG rated action sequences.  At the very least I would have liked to see some newsreels woven in.

Starting with the acting. David Tennant plays the least muscular army officer/spy and Janet Montgomery, sans her ""Jersey Girl"" accent, his love interest.  A professional cast of ancillary characters were simply not allowed to develop within the confines of the script.

A big plus is that the 2-part series basically pays tribute to the novel.  My disappointment is that the production values could have been so much more.  There was no real palpable tension or dramatic moments.

I started reading Furst in the late 90's when he was much more popular in the UK.  His earlier works were even difficult to source in the US and I would have to order from Amazon UK.  I literally devoured his works and while I feel that he may have slipped a bit with his last 3-4, Furst is still the best Author specializing in the pre-World War II genre.

While YMMV, at the right price Spies of Warsaw is worth a watch.",1362268800,6,1297,4.606986899563319

5558057,4,B00B5A9FNM,"The period between WWI and WWII has been explored countless times in movies in just about every genre from musicals to ""The Grapes of Wrath.""
Seldom, however, has there been an effort to explore the darker side of international intrigue during those two decades. This is not to say there haven't been spy movies that focus on that period but many of them were over-the-top melodrama and those that weren't were often thinly disguised propaganda films.
""Spies of Warsaw"" is neither. It is too stylish to be considered gritty but it admirably conveys the shadowy world of spy vs. spy at a period in the world's history when most of the populations of Europe and the Americas preferred not to think of the growing threat of fascism. Horrified by the industrial-strength slaughter of World War I, the majority of people on both continents wanted nothing more than ""peace in our time"" and were willing to sacrifice just about anything - including the sovereignty of small nations - to have it.
There were some, however, who read the tea leaves and worked diligently to prepare their countries for what they were certain would be a war that would be even more horrific than WWI. ""Spies of Warsaw"" tells the story of French intelligence officer Colonel Jean-Franois Mercier, a hero of both the First World War and the all-but-ignored attempt by the fledgling Soviet Union to annex Poland. Mercier, a cavalry officer, fought with the Poles to beat back the Soviets and winds up being posted to Warsaw as a military attache. His real job, however, is to run the French embassy's intelligence network; a task he undertakes with ruthless efficiency. It is in the role that he meets the beautiful lawyer Anna Skarbek.
David Tennant as Mercier and Janet Montgomery as Skarbek were nicely paired in this BBC mini-series. Tennant brought a degree of frustration and anxiety to his role of a spy that very few people listen to and Montgomery played Skarbek with what I thought was nice blend of coolness and courage. The supporting cast - especially Marcin Dorocinski as Polish Colonel Antoni Pakulski - did excellent work. The cinematography was well done - though some critics thought it ""washed out"" - and the costuming was excellent.
The series suffered, however, from what I thought was a rushed resumption of the relationship between Mercier and Skarbek. Early in the series she is living with a Russian journalist who has escaped from the Soviet Union and now writes articles condemning the communists. Mercier meets her on a blind date to a diplomatic function and is captivated by her. They have an affair and at some point he tells her that she must break it off with the Russian. Mercier leaves Poland for Paris and when he returns he learns that the French ambassador in Warsaw has arranged to have the Russian deported to the USSR and an almost certain death. Anna breaks off her affair with Mercier as a result. A year later Mercier sees the Russian at a conference, learning then that he was not an anti-communist journalist but a Soviet spy. He sends word to Anna that her former lover is alive and in a dramatic scene Mercier and Skarbek reunite on the eve of the German invasion of Poland. As a viewer, I needed at least 10 more minutes of film to show how Anna took the news, how she processed it, and then came to her decision to reunite with Mercier.
That criticism aside, I found this to be a well done production and well worth watching not just once but again and again.",1450137600,8,3478,4.722039473684211

5558060,5,B00B5A9FNM,"I was thrilled when the BBC TV series, ""Spies of Warsaw"" became available on DVD and streaming video. Emmy-winning writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais adapted the script from Alan Furst wonderful novel and did a phenomenal job!!.

If you are not familiar with him, Alan Furst is an American author of historical spy novels. He is one of my favorite authors of this genre, along with Eric Ambler and Graham Greene. Most of the author's novels are set just prior to or during the Second World War. Furst is noted for his successful evocations of Eastern European peoples and places during the period from 1933 to 1944.

In this mini-series, French, German, Russian, Polish, (etc.), intelligence operatives are locked in a life-and-death struggle. Espionage is their arena. Beginning in 1937, ""Spies of Warsaw"" is set amid the lives of the rich, famous and powerful, their underlings and the very visceral realities of pre-war Poland, France, Russia and Germany. Involved here are Polish German industrialists, SS officers, Bolsheviks, Jewish refugees, French military officers and the inevitable women who are available for a price...not necessarily monetary.

At the French embassy aristocratic Colonel Jean-Francois Mercier, (played by David Tennan) is a decorated hero of  WWI, ""The Great War to End All Wars!"" In the 1920's he also fought in a Polish unit against the Red Army. Colonel Mercier finds himself sucked into a world of abduction, betrayal and international intrigue from the diplomatic salons to the back alleys of Warsaw. Mercier simultaneously finds himself in a passionate love affair with Anna Skarbek (Janet Montgomery), a League of Nations lawyer involved with a Russian journalist. The intense love affair between Jean-Francois and Anna intensifies as German tanks drive through the Black Forest.

I found myself addicted to this series...riveted to the screen. it is true to the book in story and in spirit. I found it to be a thrilling, straightforward espionage tale. Very highly recommended!!

It's certainly dark and tense, but it's also wonderfully romantic and heroic and beautiful--with a satisfying ending, which I personally need for closure!  The cast is very good--who cares if the actors aren't actually French or Polish or German?  It's the storytelling that matters, and that's well done.  Frankly, it's easier to understand the dialogue without heavy accents getting in the way.  The character which David Tennant portrays has been said, by other reviewers, to seem emotionally restrained.  But I never had that sense at all.  He was a man totally focused, completely absorbed by his work, which needed a clear, cool head because of the danger he was putting himself in.  When he did show his emotions, it was because he was deeply moved.  David Tennant is certainly a very skilled actor and it is always a pleasure to watch him interpret whatever role he takes on.  I'm so glad I ignored the negative reviews and enjoyed this splendid production!",1402531200,5,1076,4.862637362637362
5558085,3,B00B5A9FNM,"Spies of Warsaw is pretty good but, IMO, it is not nearly as good as the book and Part 2 of the movie falls flat.

So it was with great anticipation I started this film.

All I can say is that the acting is wrong.  David Tennant as our main character is a flat dead thing.  Sometimes his expressionless face reminded me of Michael Douglas' but in any case the man's soul seemed to have departed.

Love interest?  Both main lovers seem bored and unengaged.  Another yawn, fast forwarded.

Kudos for big efforts with costumes and street scenes, interiors and old cars and trains.  These things a viewer can flicker through and enjoy.

As for the German spoken by soldiers and officers, I cannot quite even grasp how the actors can ALMOST say their German lines yet chop words out completely.  Can anyone reading this let me know?  Bizarre!  Why not speak real German sentences?  Sum ting Wong.

While most would argue that both of these topics have been mined out it, is to Alan Furst's credit that he is found a unique take on these topics. Furst has us see these events as experienced by unlikely countries and unlikely people.

I am an admirer of these books but I find them to be dreary and gray. The reader is too aware of the futility of the good works by his protagonists. It is for this reason that I have held off reading the most recent addition to his book cycle. That makes me a fan but something less than a total fan boy.

It was with a sense of anticipation and trepidation that I come to the movie the Spies of Warsaw. Much of what I find in this movie is good. The folks at the BBC workshop have captured the generally gray sense of Alan Furst. Actors and actresses generally perform well. Costuming, Sets and history meet the high standard of the author. Somehow the completed whole is not equal to the various parts.

David Tennant as Col. Jean Franois Mercier is a patriotic tightly focused professional threading the role of military attach&eacute; to a just barely prewar Poland while performing off the book functions gathering intelligence and operating spies. I cannot say that I had watched very much of David Tennant's Dr. Who but I kept expecting somebody to liven up the action by admitting that the Col. really was Dr. Who in French Army drag. This may have been my fault but I also think it reflects the general sense that this two episode set,  drags.

Without checking chapter for chapter my sense is that the two episodes pretty much reproduced virtually every episode in the original novel. Again my general sense is each scene captures the spirit of the original novel. But at the risk of being repetitious the production lacks spirit.

Ultimately this is a production about very competent, very professional people going about difficult and dangerous tasks. What distinguishes the performers that we like is their awareness of things like loyalty and responsibility towards both country and subordinates. The bad guys are not terribly bad and as such the production has a certain subtlety in how it reproduces the period.

The real struggle is not so much between our French Col. and the growing belligerence of Nazi Germany but rather his struggles with those of his superiors who either refuse to believe a new war is imminent or more critically may desire to align France with Nazi Germany. It is this second struggle that reinforces the uniqueness of Alan Furst's vision. It is because so many of the performers are acting out the roles of competent professionals that what should be a tense action movie becomes a flat recitation of events.

Fans of Alan Furst may enjoy this initial film adaptation of one of his books. There may be enough here to warrant a second viewing. I can only recommend it to those who particularly want to see the novel the Spies of Warsaw played out as a movie.",1383609600,4,3326,4.905693950177936

5558105,3,B00B5A9FNM,"SPIES OF WARSAW, (2013) is a 120 minute television mini-series that played BBCAmerica in the United States and is being distributed worldwide by the BBC. The spy thriller stars the young Scottish-born actor David Tennant, who made his name in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire/dp/B000HKY9W8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a>, and DR WHO, and is now starring in BROADCHURCH on BBCAmerica.  It is based on the novel of the same name by Alan Furst, well-known author of spy thrillers.

Tennant plays Jean-Francois Mercier, an aristocratic military attach at the French embassy in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. It is the late 1930s, and war is clearly coming to Europe. French and German intelligence operatives are locked in a life-and-death struggle. Mercier, newly appointed officer at the French embassy, is a decorated hero of the 1914 war. The handsome newcomer is drawn into a world of abduction, betrayal, and intrigue, while, at the same time, he finds himself in a passionate love affair with the beautiful Anna Skarbek, (played by Janet Montgomery) a Parisian woman of Polish heritage, who is a League of Nations lawyer. The French general Beauvilliers, with whom Mercier works, is played by Julian Glover,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-for-Britain/dp/B00E6OKWSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle for Britain</a>.  Lady Angela Hope, an Englishwoman resident in Paris, who seems to be interested in getting to know Mercier better, and also seems to resemble one of the famous English beauties of the period, is played by Fenella Woolgar,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stage-Beauty/dp/B000RHLY7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stage Beauty</a>.  Doctor Lapp is played by Anton Lesser; Duff Cooper, a well-known figure at the time, is played by Julian Harris.

This is a handsome, well-mounted production, which does itself proud in the areas of appropriate interiors, landscapes, clothes and cars. It is reasonably well-acted, and Tennant brings his characteristic intensity to his part.  But the plot is rather routine, no great surprises, and it does move slowly, as does much of the work of Furst, the author of the underlying novel.  You could say it stops to smell the roses, as it lingers over lovely Warsaw neighborhoods and estate gardens.

I've never seen much of Warsaw on film: just various Holocaust movies such as Roman Polanski's THE PIANIST, Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLERS LIST, and various documentaries about the Jewish ghetto uprising. None of these films was particularly interested in lingering to show viewers Warsaw's prettier districts.  And last year, I took the trip of a lifetime to Middle Europe: I was interested to see that Warsaw looks nothing like the Mittel European capitals I recently saw, Budapest, Vienna, or Prague.  Evidently the residents of Warsaw have never had quite as much money as the residents of these more famous cities to invest in their hometown.  It's worth a look.",1377734400,,3124,5.904656319290465

Right up front I will admit to owning all of Alan Furst's novels in hardback, and I flat like his writing, especially the pre WWII time period. I will, at some risk of reputation, put this in the same league as the original SMILEY'S or SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. This is based on, not an exact copy of, the novel SPIES OF WARSAW and in my view is a good choice for the first of Furst's novels to be filmed. True to most, if not all, movie adaptations, it does drift from the book a bit, and, truth be told, if you have not read Furst it may take you more than one viewing to pick up the nuance of this story. Some of the subplots are not clearly developed and minor characters are somewhat cardboard. This is a ""feet up, drink in hand"" rainly afternoon show, and well worth it.

5558124,3,B00B5A9FNM,"I am a real fan of the BBC drama shows that are out on TV now. They involve great acting, storylines and cinematography. This show just missed that quality level because of a slow moving script and dialog. It was a turbulent time right before WWII and everyone in Warsaw who was a politician or a diplomat was a spy it seems. There was enough possible scenarios and story line that this could have been really good but it just seems that none of the cast had a real passion for their roles. The acting seemed awkward and stiff, even uninspired at times.

The series is broken into two parts and Part One for me was better and it seemed to move more quickly. Part Two was very slow and it just seemed to drag on. Was it worth watching, yes. Was it great, no. It is based on a novel and I thought it should just move faster. I don't want to put in any spoilers but you should watch it as a period piece about a time in history but don't expect to be overwhelmed.

I was supplied a DVD to review and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.",1366848000,,1044,4.112745098039215
5558125,4,B00B5A9FNM,"Spies of Warsaw could have been a truly great movie. It has all the advantages of dramatic historical events well known to its viewers, though not yet to its characters.  On the eve of World War 2, it seems likely that the Germans will invade a number of other countries.  However, politicians, diplomats, the United Nations, and spies are trying to evade widespread European war or at least, defeat for their own countries.  The main characters are all diplomats, spies, or fleeing Jews. We should be able to sympathize with them, hope they will achieve some positive results, and that they will live through the horrors we know about in hindsight. The plot contains plenty of suspense, action, and twists. There appears to have been a large production budget and someone paid lots of attention to costumes and settings. Given this material, how could the BBC fail?

Well, the BBC did fail. The fault seems to lie in three areas.  First, in some places the background is not well laid. For example, Mercier goes to great lengths to save Poland from defeat. Yet you never know if this is due to loyalty to the country where he's been a French diplomat for 20 years (only a chance remark near the end of the movie reveals the length of time), or because if Poland falls, France will be weaker.  Second, the dialog is pedestrian throughout.  Third, and worst, the acting is so wooden it's hard to sympathize with any of the characters, no matter whether they are in love, or acting heroically, or betraying someone, or enduring great uncertainty, suffering, or peril.  (Except when David Tennant acts bug-eyed terrified, as evidenced on the front cover of the DVD--then he's positively camp.) The experience is like viewing the movie through bubble glass. You can pretty much tell what's going on, but even though you try hard, you can't really care. I wish someone would remake this movie.",1366675200,3,1888,4.787692307692308
5558126,2,B00B5A9FNM,"I was really looking forward to a WWII tale of a time period not usually featured in ""Hollywood"" movies, but the more I watched this the duller it got. David Tennant was so lackadaisacal I almost dozed (and not being a Dr. Who fan, I had no real frame of reference about him from that show). But what got me the most was a scene between two Nazis where the superior officer come into a shower to chastise his underling, and they blurred out the naked rear end of the Nazi and bleeped a couple of curse words. Somehow that was so funny, I just could not continue trying o enjoy the show and I gave up before the finish.",1366243200,2,618,4.158333333333333
5558127,4,B00B5A9FNM,"The story is very well portrayed in the period, all costumes and environment evidently well researched and the slow pace captivating.

The spies are real people with real missions, so if you are expecting cars exploding and that sort of stuff you're not going to find it here. I think it lacks in suspense a little and that's why I rated it 4 stars.

David Tennant can read the breakfast menu and still do a great job. He plays a somber yet sexy spy and it always amazes me how he can change with every character he plays.

I enjoyed it and looked forward to the second part after the first one was over (saw it when it first aired in the UK). I must admit I didn't read the book so I don't have the usual ""the book was better"" comment to make.

Overall, if you are a Tennant fan, it is absolutely a good show to see, he performs as usual and looks absolutely wonderful as Jean Mercier.",1366243200,10,886,4.194117647058824
5558128,4,B00B5A9FNM,"A very good movie, a well done period piece. David Tennant is excellant in this movie. DT usally plays most parts with a little quarkiness, but not this time, he plays this part as a streight dramatic part. The movie plays the period before WW11 Europe just perfect. This was really a end of a era for the world. The spy parts were done very well because thay stayed in the shadows and were not the James Bond's types but the ordinary down to earth type's that blended in. I expecially liked where they showed the James Phillbee chareture who was a real life russian spy in the british secret service until he was discovered in the 60's. The Polish locations are beautiful and the old town of Warsaw is wonderful and a testament to the spirit of the polish people who restored Warsaw right after the war which had been distroyed. The polish actors are great in this film. If their is any conplaint, it is the ending, the film did not go far enough. I did like the love story between David and Janet montgomery but I think they could have done more with it.  Now I want to say how amazing Amazon is, I pre-ordered this DVD and it was released today April 16, and I received it at 2:00 P.M. my time, great service, great products, thank you Amazon.",1366070400,14,1246,4.347639484978541

There are some changes that were made in the televised version but I found those changes to be clever and in my opinion they made the story more realistic. Also, the acting is superb and the storyline is incredibly good! I love how DT protrays Mercier and how he portrays his nature. DT has an excellent understanding of the character and it shows!  Janet Montgomery and Marcin Dorosinski were amazing too!

When this first aired in the UK I read some comments about how some people didn't like the ending, but a as a fellow reviewer here said this is not your usual story. This is a story about human nature and about how some brave, clever people tried to prevent a war from starting. We all know they failed, but watching their efforts makes me glad to be a human being, and glad to be able to read and watch stories like this.

He plays the cool and calm spy thing pretty well actually. That's something interesting in and of itself, because we are so used to seeing him playing The Doctor, a bit infectious and hyperactive.

5558131,5,B00B5A9FNM,"If you're expecting BANG POW EXPLODEY 007 then go watch a James Bond movie. Bond is great for what it is, and I love a good Bond film. This isn't that kind of spy story and if you are looking for that with this film you're barking up the wrong tree. This is plot and character driven, bittersweet, gritty and realistic. Beautifully photographed on location, this is what life was like in that era for people in the world of covert ops. Intriguing and romantic, it holds true to canon. ""But the book was better"" you say? Well, isn't that always the case?

David Tennant never disappoints. Leave Doctor Who out of this, it's nowhere near it, nor is his character. Mr. Tennant has shown yet again his range and depth - his acting is quite liquid and one can see so much going on behind his eyes it's almost like reading his thoughts.

It was brilliantly cast and directed, taut in tone with wonderful dialog and pace. The score only adds to the dark mood and was wonderfully written and executed. The costumes were well-researched and replicated. So much love has gone into the little details of this film and it shows. This is what quality television looks like. As stated, this isn't James Bond. James Bond is, at the end of the day, as much fantasy as action story. This isn't that. It is, at the end of the day, about human nature, just as all the best stories are.

Without spoiling, I'll say the ending was a bittersweet definition of the word verisimilitude. Spies of Warsaw is a spy story for the thinking person.",1365033600,8,1518,4.472924187725631

8562739,3,B00B5A9FNM,"3 1/2 stars -- I haven't read Alan Furst's novel, so the question of the ""faithfulness"" of this 2-part BBC serial isn't of concern to me.  It's quite enjoyable, very well shot, and well-acted.  It covers quite a bit of historical and geographical ground, and while three hours might seem long for a thriller, there are times when the transitions of time and, especially, geography seem a bit sudden.  To the director's credit, though, the plot is always clear, and the historical information needed to understand what's at stake is effectively worked in.  The limitations are, perhaps, those of script -- for the visuals, whether in Warsaw, Berlin, Paris, or various countrysides and forests, look good.  David Tennant is Colonel Jean-Francois Mercier, an aristocratic WW1 hero-turned-diplomat, who is working out of the French Embassy in Warsaw, in effect as a spy keeping an eye on German and Russian intentions c. 1937 (at the movie's opening).  He's a mixture of James Bond and the Scarlet Pimpernel, and Janet Montgomery is Anna, a Polish woman working for the by-then-flailing League of Nations as it tries to keep the peace in Europe.  Their situation is a bit of a cliche, and the writing doesn't really do much to make them seem all that interesting.  The interest, one might say, is more in their situations than in their characters.  So Tennant's trademark wide-eyed intensity seems a bit forced here -- the script isn't in the ""Broadchurch"" league -- and Montgomery likewise isn't given a whole lot to work with.  Still, it's a good plot, as Tennant seeks to thwart bad guys of various ideologies as well as bureaucratic incompetence closer to home.  What would a movie like this be without bureaucratic incompetence?!  Still, the actors are fine and the story is good.  It won't bore you.",1475798400,,1801,4.923841059602649
