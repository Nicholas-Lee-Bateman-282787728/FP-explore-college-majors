4398071,1,B004KS21NW,"Bill is no different from any other anti-mormon theorist that has existed for nearly the past 200 years and follows the same pattern in presentation. Anything new here? No. Relevant? No. I've done some research realizing that there may be extremists on both sides of the aisle.

Regarding the Masonic connection, the early mormon church leaders joined up several years after the church was organized and Masonry was in vogue in that period of time especially in that area (I think its still in, to a degree, as I have several family members out east that are Masons). I suspect that they joined for a couple reasons. 1-All the influencial folks were Masons so to push or pull social influence joining a club (which is basically what it was back then at least) was the smart thing to do. 2-They hoped to convert Masons. Mormons like to preach and baptize everyone they can. Is this any different from any other Christian sect (and yes, I believe they are Christian since, as Joel Osteen pointed out in a televised interview, they believe in Christ and try to emmulate his teachings and example)? How better to do this than to ""join the club"" and befriend more folks almost automatically?

One thing that the real anti folks seem to forget is that the mormon prophet Joe Smith and his brother (both Mason's) were assasinated by a mob with many Masons in it. According to some accounts from both sides, as the mob attacked they sought for help from those Masons as is their oath to do (to help/protect fellow-masons when called upon) and the mob-Masons just killed them. From that time forward the church leaders have discouraged association with the Masons.

I don't care to waste more space here about anything else from the dvd. If you'd like an open-minded discussion post it. However, I find it interesting that so many anit-mormons say things like ""Mormon's are the worst"" or ,""they are the spawn of satan."" I don't pretend to know satan, but have any of you ever met a mormon? I live in Mesa, AZ and there's a bunch of 'em out here. Several of my best friends and neighbors are mormons. Yes, I've been preached to. So what. I still have my freedom to choose to accept or even to listen. Of all the mormon folks that I know and meet, none match the anti's description. In fact I've had several born-agains knock on my door that I thought were pretty bad. Do I get along with all of them? No. But they're not any different from anyone else.

In summary with regard to this dvd, folks use your own damn brain. Stop letting people scare you into believing the worst about things you don't know anything about. Do you have to like their teachings? No. What about all the buddhists, muslims and the hundreds of other religions that don't even profess a belief in Christ? Do what Christ says and live and let live. I'll end with a quote from Myron Fagan--one of the biggest conspiracy theorists of all time--speaking with regard to what he calls the, ""Judas organization,"" or the National Council of Churches. ""...the Mormon Church is about the only [church] I know of that is clean of that kind of Judas infiltration."" And no, he is not a mormon. Food for thought.",1312156800,12,3162,4.591150442477876
4398072,1,B004KS21NW,"What an interesting author!?! If you research him, he has also been catholic and who knows what else he proclaims to be. Is he just the incarnate of the master of lies? Research Bill and his other books before you buy.",1307059200,5,218,4.341463414634147
4398073,5,B004KS21NW,"A few years ago, I wrote an article on cults and their beliefs. What I found was that many of them had things in common, such as none of them believe in the Trinity, the Deity of Christ, as well as some other beliefs. One other factor that each of these cults had in common was that the founders were all Freemasons. Although many people don't realize it today, because they think this is just a club of old men, Freemasonry is worship of Lucifer. This is why I can believe everything Bill said is true. I researched some of the points in his presentation, and they all line up.

""By witches, for witches"" is what Bill said about the Mormon church. It's believable! This makes you wonder about Glenn Beck and some of the others who promote the false liberal ecumenical movement. This is distinctly Masonic, but it also distinctly Luciferian witchcraft.

Great presentation. Lots of information to digest.",1300320000,29,904,4.64375

It's so obvious that this guy was against the Mormons to begin with and went with purpose to make it look bad... and did a bad job doing it. There's no objectivity and there's blatant hate for that religion. If this guys really is christian, then there's no love or understanding in Christianity.",1501372800,,388,4.402777777777778

8433353,5,B004KS21NW,"I have viewed this DVD 2 times in the last week & find it an excellent presentation of the LDS Church with wonderful footage of the Temples. I have read many books on Mormonism & everything he says is absolutely true but with the perspective of a former Satanist. I wish more Evangelical Christians would take the time to undertand the implications of electing a Mormong President.  This DVD shows the political agenda of the LDS Church & can not be disputed as there is such a thing as the Mormon White Horse Prophecy given by Joseph Smith & the idea that their church is the only true church on the planet; therefore, they believe (as do Muslims) that their religion must rule the world at some point.  His expose of the Temple in Silver Springs MD is also eye opening.  All Christians must go into this election with their eyes wide open & their hearts truly seeking repentance praying for mercy for this country.  At this point, we have no good choice.",1342310400,8,956,4.508670520231214

8433356,5,B004KS21NW,"This DVD is well done and worth every penny. If you would like to know the truth about the religion from someone who did not leave due to being jilted, this is the way to go. He gives an in dept teaching as to what is taught behind closed doors, and what most of their own ""members"" don't even know about. Every born again, saved by grace, and not by works lest any man should boast Christian, needs to get this DVD (or borrow it). The Holy Bible states in Hosea 4:6a My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge

Hosea 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
