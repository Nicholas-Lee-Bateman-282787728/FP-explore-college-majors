2194812,5,B0006TK8E8,I was surprised that the product was a VCR tape instead of a DVD but fortunately I still have a VCR player so I was able to use it.  I like the low impact exercises and really enjoy working out with the tape.,1343088000,3,208,3.8372093023255816
2194813,3,B0006TK8E8,"A majority of exercisers are absolutely in love with this video.  I am not one of them.

Idrea is indeed an inspiration.  She starts off the video by telling her inspiring weight loss story, pointing out various students that the viewer can relate to (one has a knee brace, one is a first timer, a mother/daughter team and so on).  She has an enthusiastic attitude and approachable demeanor for which she earned a star from me.

The setting is a bright open area (one-toned so it isn't distracting) with many female participants of all shapes, sizes and race filling up the spaces and leader Idrea by herself on a stage of the same color.  It was visually appealing to me.  Add another star.

The warm-up was a bit quick but thorough and lightly raised your heart rate.  It was a bit difficult to see the screen when doing the leg and back stretches the first few times but gradually got easier.

The workout was strictly low impact but changed moves VERY quickly with little warning.  Just as I felt that I was getting the hang of the changes, Idrea would announce ""SIDE STEP!"", the go-to move that is the equivalent to ""march it out"" in other videos and the routine changes.  I also follow mirror cues and Idrea unfortunately does not do that with her class.  That was frustrating to attempt.  The only entertaining part of this routine to me was the cool-down in which Idrea let the participants do their own thing while talking to each student and trying to mimic their moves.  I personally did a proper gradual decline.

The worst part of this video to me was the toning.  The toning exercises for the hips, thighs and buttocks were not difficult but they were done far too quickly with no cuing from the supposed teacher and the camera angles made it hard to see what the movements were.  Unfortunately the abdominal segment had Thr same issues.  The final stretching portion at the end was minimal but effective and estranged one last star.

I suppose the majority of reviewers were hooked on the enthusiasm of the instructor and the relatable participants.  I however bought this for the workout, which was mentally exhausting to say the least.",1334707200,,2152,4.64021164021164
2194814,5,B0006TK8E8,"I first bought this tape years ago when Idrea was an exercise instructor at a gym next to my hair salon--Madonna Nouvelle, in Studio City.  The exercises at first glance seemed too easy.  However, as I soon discovered, you get a great workout in a relatively short period of time.  Now, years later, I have rediscovered this tape (buried for several years in a cabinet).  I wish the VHS format were in DVD format--much easier to load and wouldn't have to rewind every day.",1268870400,7,472,4.583333333333333
2194815,5,B0006TK8E8,"When I first saw this video, I was 10 and would do it with my mother. What I loved most was that Idrea wasn't some sized 2 woman telling us we could do it. She and the women on the video are average, everyday women. They are diverse in race, size and age. And Idrea is so encouraging. I'm not a larger woman myself, but I love this video more than any other one I have because the women are real. They grunt during the floor exercises because it hurts. You see them all sweating and making faces when an exercise hurts, and you see some people mess up on the steps. Yet, they keep going. You can't get more real than that. And with all the cheers, you feel like you're in class with these women. I love it.",1237075200,7,706,4.05
