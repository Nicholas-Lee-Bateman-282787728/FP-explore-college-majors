She says she's ""extrasizing"" as she jumps and moves around imitating Kristi and the kids on the video. The snacking section is great too. Now she asks to have healthy snacks to make her strong. This video will definitely get your kids off the couch!!",1112572800,,349,4.223880597014926

Get Fit Kids is so creative and unique, and that's what makes it #1 in my book. Instead of just dancing around, Kristi, the kids, and the animated bear named JoJo Fitz, do real exercise moves that improves motor skills, balance, flexibility, coordination, self-esteem, and the list goes on. Kristi actually interacts with the children asking question's like do you know were your muscles are? She has the children feel for their muscles, teaching them why it's important to strengthen them, and move around.

I love the nutrition section of this video!!! Every time I show my classroom this section each one of them ask to eat healthy, such as asking for an apple, carrot, or grapes. Get Fit Kids is a must have!!!! Every child needs to learn how to live a healthy lifestyle from Kristi Dear. She makes it so much fun.",1110153600,,940,4.562130177514793
