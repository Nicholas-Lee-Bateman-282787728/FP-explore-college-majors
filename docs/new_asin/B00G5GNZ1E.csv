6061321,3,B00G5GNZ1E,A decent film with decent 3D.  Nothing amazing.  I bought as part of a pack so wasn't exactly excited about it in thr first place.,1393891200,2,130,4.16
6061322,5,B00G5GNZ1E,"This is a very interesting documentation of the universe and what is known about it today.  The explanation of the 'Big Bang' and the formation of stars, planets and galaxies is riveting.",1392681600,13,187,4.84375
6061323,3,B00G5GNZ1E,"Audio in english only. Three stories of 45 minutes each. The titles are. Crash landing on mars, Worst days on planet earth and God and the universe. This titles are no new. You see them before in the bluray collection. The 3D effects are no bad but they are no better than other 3D movies. With more time and dedication it would be better. History Channel has the money to make it better. Still waiting.",1390003200,8,403,4.386666666666667

Many cool 3D graphics. 1080p 3D quality and there with no buffering or loss of picture quality due to streaming issues becuase its a blu Ray. Nice to sit though 3D content with no loss of quality.,1517184000,,249,4.319148936170213

6061333,1,B00G5GNZ1E,"Very lame.  This might have been worthy of ""3D"" in the 90s but by today's standards its garbage.  Only about 1/20th has any 3D effect and 95% of it is just a person talking.  You can see there is a little depth in the background but with the universe, i expected more CGI and Space scenes.  Not something I would ever recommend. I've found better material on youtube.",1499299200,,367,4.352941176470588

6061340,4,B00G5GNZ1E,"Overall quite interesting and thought provoking. Three modest length documentaries of scientific interest, with regards to our place in the universe. Very reasonably priced for the product and it's content. Quite sure it'll view well in 2D, but 3D made all the difference for me. Very good value.",1484956800,5,296,5.1875

6061377,5,B00G5GNZ1E,This is a great video. It doesn't disappoint. It delivers exactly what you hope it might. It's informative but it's also quite beautiful in the 3-D effects are really wonderful to watch and experience. I highly recommend this video compared to a lot of the other space videos in 3-D that I've seen this one is the gold standard,1443571200,10,327,4.559322033898305

6061381,1,B00G5GNZ1E,Terrible from the 3D standpoint and nothing but a pack of evolutionary lies. If you're an atheist and a fool you should enjoy this fable film most true scientists and those who've been in space and witnessed the glory of His creation would laugh at this. I should've known better coming through the history channel.,1438819200,5,315,4.745454545454545
