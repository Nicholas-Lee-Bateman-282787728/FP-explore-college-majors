8133361,4,B000GLDMOE,"Dick Tracy Returns, 1938 film

Chester Gould wrote the Dick Tracy comic strip for the Chicago Tribune, it was very popular with both young and old. Movie serials were shown each week in theaters to encourage weekly attendance. Republic Pictures produced these and others; they were famous for their many Westerns. These were called cliffhangers as their activities enticed the audience to return. How do these action stories compare to todays dramas on TV and in the movies? This is the second of the four serials produced before WW II. It uses real events in its stories, such as the 200-inch telescope lens in the Palomar Observatory fabricated in Corning NY. Would a manufacturer deal with a criminal gang and a foreign spy? This has more action than the previous serial. Most episodes repeat a few minutes from an earlier episode, which adds to the length of this movie.

Dick Tracy is at war with the criminal Stark Gang, composed of relatives like the James-Younger Gang. In the late 19th century Los Angeles had the highest crime rate in the country. City officials colluded with both millionaires and organized crime; read a history book. The novels of Raymond Chandler and Erle Stanley Gardner were set in this era of Los Angeles. Note the things that are obsolete: steam locomotives, vertical car windshields, fabric roofed automobiles, dirt roads, cars with running boards, open cockpit airplanes, owner-operated stores, etc. Revolvers seem to have an unlimited amount of ammunition, no reloading required. Do todays villains still have foreign names? The right to keep and bear arms was not restricted in California (in this movie).
