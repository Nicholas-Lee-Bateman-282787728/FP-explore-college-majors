4573910,2,B0055CP9RC,"I was disappointed in this product.  I purchased this DVD as a surprise for our kids for an upcoming roadtrip.  The ""new"" story, ""Larry Learns to Listen"",  was just a new song.  I wasted my money, because we already had the other 2 stories.  I felt it was misleading.",1322179200,19,267,4.36734693877551

8458051,1,B0055CP9RC,"This was intentionally misleading. The front cover states ""3 Great Stories"" and has a small bubble box that states ""Includes All New Musical Story ""Listen"""". I thought this was a new song to go along with the new story. The back cover states ""An all new story..."" AND ...Also includes two classic shows! ""Pistachio"" and ""Josh and the Big Wall"". I wish I had read the reviews first. Wasted my money. I agree that Big Idea should stop making compilations. Annoying to have to read the box so closely and frustrating when it is just another compilation for remarketing and making more money. I use these as a tool to teach my children a biblical lesson in a way that they can understand. I have no problem buying new shows that do this. I do have a problem wasting my money on shows I already have-just for a new five minute song. Very, very frustrated!",1388534400,,850,4.490322580645161
8458052,1,B0055CP9RC,"I also was disappointed in this product, but not as much as my son was. I purchased this DVD for him, a life long veggie tales fan. The ""new"" story, ""Larry Learns to Listen"", was just a new song. I wasted my money, because we already had the other 2 stories. It is misleading.",1353283200,3,276,4.12962962962963
8458053,5,B0055CP9RC,This a DVD I would recommend for any one loves Veggies Tales.  I also recommend for children and any one else who wants some wholesome entertainment.,1343952000,,149,4.730769230769231
8458054,5,B0055CP9RC,"Another great movie put out by Big Idea! My VBS kids, adults and high school helpers loved this movie. The movie cover, Larry Learns to Listen, is actually a short in the movie and not the main feature. However, there are other lengthier stories on the DVD that go very well with that theme. Very easy to make faith-life connections with the kids. DVD also arrived very timely and in excellent condition.",1340668800,,404,4.625
8458055,5,B0055CP9RC,My grandson loves to watch Veggie tales.  They are fun for adults to because they have little jokes or hidden references that kids wouldn't really notice that make us laugh.  The writers imagination is just wonderful.  It is nice to see something that actually tries to teach our kids a story with a moral.,1326499200,,306,4.62962962962963
