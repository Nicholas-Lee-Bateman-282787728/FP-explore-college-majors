8498620,1,B006HUNFXG,The only good acting in this awful film comes from Joey Kern.,1462406400,,61,4.166666666666667
8498621,4,B006HUNFXG,"This is in my opinion the first movie Ross Patterson did where he was able to get some creative control. During the MLB strike of 1994 people start following wiffleball and look to Ted Whitfield to break the home run record, but that is a lot of pressure for one man. This is true Ross Patterson style is also shot as a pseudo documentary. I found it to be very funny at times but it didn't have as many laughs as his later movies. This in my opinion is where the outrageous movie making style of Ross Patterson really got its start, and that certainly makes it worth a purchase.",1430092800,,579,4.2727272727272725
8498622,5,B006HUNFXG,"Is it stupid? Clearly.  Does it feel low-budget?  Clearly.  Did it make me laugh out loud?  Absolutely.  The Ross Patterson universe reminds me a bit of the Will Ferrell universe (on a smaller scale, of course) where some people will watch and not laugh once while some will connect inexplicably and watch everything they can by the creator.  I'm in the buy everything Ross Patterson camp.  How about Ross Patterson and Will Ferrell?  Holy Crap, that would awesome.",1409788800,,465,4.871794871794871
8498623,5,B006HUNFXG,Last year I stumbled across FDR American Badass with my podcast Zak's Movie show. We then interviewed Ross Patterson himself awesome guy btw. watched his other films and have been a fan ever since! It's a funny film with plenty of laughs he is genius!,1379635200,,251,4.6
