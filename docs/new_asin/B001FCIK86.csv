8301925,3,B001FCIK86,"This 3 Volume set of the notorious 'PLATINUM' branding on DVDs on such programs as AMOS'N'ANDY is again used here. While Volumes 1 & 2 are high quality products, the DVD producers weren't nearly as gentle with these episodes. Many do not have closing credits running to conclusion and video quality is rather hit-and-miss. They're nearly as badly reproduced at the aforementioned AMOS'N'ANDY set.",1389139200,,396,5.203125
