8203135,5,B000RY9C58,"This DVD is very impressive! I already bought Praising Spirit Vol. 1 & Vol. 2 by the same producers & performer (who I absolutely love); so ordered their patriotic DVD as well. This DVD is also very elegant, well produced, and everything I hoped it would be. The patriotic songs are performed in stunning style and grace, and actually moved me to tears  especially The Star Spangled Banner. Like most people, I have seen the national anthem performed thousands of times before ball games, etc., but I have never ever seen it performed so magnificently! It honestly made me cry, and made me proud to be an American. This is a must have DVD. The sign language performer (Hayden Riley) is beautiful, powerful and inspirational. I am very pleased, impressed, and highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants a truly inspirational experience learning sign language. I have now ordered all the other DVD's with Hayden Riley performing, (A Silent Night Christmas Carols in ASL; and Praising Spirit Vol. 1 and Praising Spirit Vol. 2). Thank you Hayden, you are amazing! I cant wait to sign like you!",1365120000,,1092,4.808510638297872
