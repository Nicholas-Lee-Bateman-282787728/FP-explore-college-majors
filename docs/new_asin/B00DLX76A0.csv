8594361,5,B00DLX76A0,"I love this DVD. 15 minutes to me just doesn't cut it, am a glutton for cardio, so I play all (bottom option). Total workout is 57 minutes but fast forward in between to jump to the next set, you'll end up with a solid 57mins of nothing but fast passed cardio sweating.
Most of the crew are wearing weighted gloves, which I own a pair of 1lb ( I could't find a 2lb set). These help you burn extra calories and set a little more.

Pros:
Great music
Live crew makes fun workout
No cheesy dance moves
Fast passed cardio
Full Body workout, head to toe
You will sweat buckets! And love it

Cons:
If you are less co-ordinated, the fancy feet will throw you off
Wish it was a non-stop workout, but I understand some people don't have 57 minutes - I do
Live setting may be confusing to some with the camera shifts, but be patient, after a couple of sessions, you'll get it",1473206400,,864,4.167664670658683

8594363,5,B00DLX76A0,"I have had the honor to meet Mr Billy Blanks on two occassions at my church. I sit at a desk all day. I am tired when I get home. I do absolutely nothing for exercise. I thought to myself if anyone can motivate me, Billy Blanks can. This dvd is amazing. You can do a 15 minute workout or the entire thing. It is not difficult. It is fun. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to everyone.",1393977600,,407,3.9156626506024095
8594364,1,B00DLX76A0,"I don't like leaving negative reviews and I like TaeBo in general, but this one didn't do it for me. I wish it was returnable, but since it's open, it's not. I don't know if it's the short format (4 short workouts) or the ""live"" part of it, but I didn't follow these workouts at all. I actually didn't finish (just let the DVD keep playing and didn't do the workout) the first time because I just wasn't interested or following it at all, and I always finish a workout once I start it. One thing that particularly bothered me is how Billy is cueing some of the time in this DVD by facing the exercisers on the stage, while they are all facing the camera like usual. Just confusing and unnecessary - I don't know why he thought that was a good idea. Maybe to make sure all the participants are doing it correctly? but when you're filming something to sell as a home DVD, shouldn't how the home participant will view the workout be a primary concern?! I am familiar with TaeBo and like some of the workouts, but I won't be buying any more any time soon. The newer ones are just not that great.",1387065600,2,1091,4.25
8594365,5,B00DLX76A0,"I have been working out with Billy since the beginning.  First let me say that this workout is 55 minutes long.  You can break it up into 15 minute increments, or you can run through the complete workout.  Billy's workouts are always fun and you get what you put into it.  If you have been working out with Billy for a while you will pick up the moves quickly.  If you are new just give it some time.  I highly recommend!",1379289600,5,421,4.135802469135802
