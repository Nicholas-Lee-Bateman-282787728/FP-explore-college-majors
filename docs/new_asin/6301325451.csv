7810859,5,6301325451,"What a riveting movie. I lived through the ""testing"" era and was haunted by what I saw on film clips--didn't people know they were being exposed to radiation during those tests? Apparently they didn't. This movie goes one step further to show that some may have known but chose not to share that knowledge. A very interesting storyline, and believable--scary.",1279065600,,359,5.0
7810860,4,6301325451,"I had a copy of a copy of a copy.......you get the picture, a very poor quality one. I liked the movie, and wanted an original copy of it. It is a very hard to find movie, and as far as I know it's not available on DVD. The movie stars Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez playing the sam man in two different time periods of his life. A gripping tale of nuclear testing in the 50s, and how in present day the government couldn't care less about the health problems it caused the men it knowingly sent to their fate.",1246406400,,511,4.069306930693069
7810861,4,6301325451,"The details and attitudes of this film are quite accurate. I have had the pleasure of working with two atom bomb ""test subjects"", two of over 235,000 soldiers deliberately exposed to radiation of atom bomb testing in the past decade.  Their plight is harsh - cancers, breakdown of soft tissue, every case has resemblence to the next.  Still, the US government denies wrongdoing and danger to the soldiers of that draft era.",1122336000,3,423,4.861111111111111
7810862,4,6301325451,"It can be argued that ""Nightbreaker"" is a politicized view of Cold War atomic testing designed to support an anti-nuclear agenda.  The reality is, in terms of its history, this film is rather accurate and relatively unbiased.  There is no doubt about its conclusion, that nuclear weapons and the testing of such weapons are bad things.  But even those who advocate a strong defense have no means of disagreeing with facts.  About 90% of the details regarding the military involvement in above-ground nuclear weapons testing in Nevada is shown quite accurately here.  The final test in the film, which had soldiers exposed to a blast without benefit of cover, is fictitious, but barely worse that some of the conditions they really did go through.  If you grew up during the Cold War, as I did, this is a compelling look at a dark secret that our nation felt forced by the threatening times to explore.  Read the book ""Under the Cloud"" by Richard Miller or visit the online website for the Portland Area Atomic Veterans for first-hand testimony from the men who participated in these tests to get a feel for how accurate this movie really is.  The performances by Martin Sheen and Lea Thompson aren't bad, but Emilio Estevez is excellent and Joe Pantaliano is the truly outstanding player in this ensemble.  He bears the burden of leadership as his platoon's sergeant with grace and confidence but is very dependent on the trust he places in Estevez, which forms the climactic emotion of the film.  This really is well worth seeing and should be released on DVD.",1111622400,11,1561,4.791044776119403
7810863,5,6301325451,"I feel that this movie is one of the most underrated political dramas of all time.  This is probably because the subject matter was far too enervating for the average viewer to stomach.  The movie comes across as a documentary of the early atomic age acted out by excellent actors.  The movie stars Martin Sheen, Emilio Estevez and Lea Thompson and a host of great supporting characters who are real fun to look at.  But taken as pure entertinment, the subject matter is still ugly.
Martin Sheen plays Esteves' character as an older sucessful neurologist who is visiting Las Vegas during a convention.  When a former soldier in a wheelchair appears and pleads for his help, Sheen is forced to recall his position as a psychological tester of US army soldiers who were being trained during the 1950's by the US army for combat in a nuclear environment. The movie mostly consists of Sheen's flashbacks to his youth (played by Esteves)where he uncovers that the soldiers and himself are being lied to by the army about radiation.  Esteves, after growing attached to the platoon he was supposed to be observing, becomes way to involved in the nuclear experiments.
Sheen gives a powerful performance of a man who must tell the truth about the past so that he can face the future with a clear conscience.  Nevertheless, the film has no car chases, no hand-to-hand combat, gunfighting, etc, so it's easy to see why it wasn;t a huge hit.  However, if you happen to be a history teacher or just a history buff with an interest in the early days of the Cold War, you MUST own a copy of this movie!!!",1079827200,5,1589,4.629893238434164
