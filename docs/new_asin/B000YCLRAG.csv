3025805,4,B000YCLRAG,"this was a ligt hearted opera typical of Donizetti.
because the topic was something day to day a typical happening of ordinary
folks, it evoked a charming story about a typical lad enamored of a girl.(a very typical and regular situation)
The charm of the light opera was supplemented by the nice voices of both
Pavarotti, Blegen and other singers like the peddle who came into the
stage in a ballon which was so amusing!",1190332800,3,421,4.626666666666667

8231798,5,B000YCLRAG,"I love opera and the early year recordings of Pavarotti are fantastic. This is particularly important in this opera where a clear high C for a long time is required. And Pavarotti is excelling as in so many other opera arias. I highly recommend it to anyone with even a ""smidgen of liking"" of Italian Opera.",1461715200,,307,4.5
8231799,4,B000YCLRAG,It was a Christmas present for my son-in-law and I hope he enjoyed it as much as we did when we heard it at home.,1420070400,,113,3.56
8231800,5,B000YCLRAG,"I have owned this opera for many years on laser disk. I think the performance was in 1983, so the video is not up to today's standards. Nonetheless, the performance was wonderful, Pavarotti was at his best.  If you're not overly concerned with perfect video quality, I highly recommend it.",1395273600,,289,4.78
8231801,5,B000YCLRAG,"There exists on Youtube an Otto Schenk production of this opera dated 1988 starring Pavarotti, Ferrarini and Taddei (at 72).  That is the best version I have ever watched of this opera. The performances of Pavarotti, Taddei and Ferrarini are exemplary and completely refined and lively, so I hunted far and wide for an early Pavarotti 'Elisir'.
This 1982 MET production is the second best, in overall terms of production, performance, conducting, acting...
I must admit that the Ferrarini/Pavarotti/Taddei is, however, the unsurpassed version.
The reasons? Pavarotti himself first - Pavarotti was very good here, but he was really 'great' in that one, especially his duets with Taddei and Ferrarini.  His acting, too, very good here, was terrific there in that Otto Schenk production. Also, the ease Pavarotti sang this role was totally evident in the Vienna performance.
Secondly, the Adina of Ferrarini was about the best portrayal vocally and dramatically of that era, some thing that Blegen came close, but not equalled. Similar plight befalls Battle's later 1990's portrayal, too.
Thirdly, Bruscantini, though very dramatic and lively, is not as adept as Giuseppe Taddei in the role of Dulcamara.
Even so, this MET performance is still by quite a good stretch better than the early 1990 one, and Blegen a stylistically and vocally better Adina than either Gheorghiu or Netrebko.
The staging of MET in this 1982 production is to be highly recommended, so is the conducting.
Unless the 1988 Vienna version becomes commercially available, this MET 1982 version tops them all.",1365292800,5,1577,5.229249011857707
8231802,2,B000YCLRAG,"Nov 19th 2009...just finished watching this on my 100"" screen....the visual quality is so poor that I had to zoom into a smaller screen size (50"") to make it bearable. Pavarotti acts like a 5th grader, but sings superbly, but Bruscantini and Blegen are both effortful in their coloratura, and his aging voice lacks a clear centre to the notes....a charming but woolly performance. The sound is so low I had to set my amp's volume way beyond any setting I have ever used before. Approach this issue with caution....only for small screen viewers who adore Pavarotti.",1258588800,5,564,4.824742268041237
8231803,5,B000YCLRAG,"This is so much fun, you just laugh out loud.
 Pavarotti--as other reviewers mentioned (and I paid attention)--is young and just full of it!  Watching him is a delight.  His acting is right on for this opera.  Not quite Gomer Pyle, but along the same lines.  Despite running a little pudgy even then, he moved lightly and nimbly on his feet like the soccer player he was.  His face seemed to have more mobility than in later years.  Listening to him was even more delightful.  His voice is fresh and powerful.  Not remembering the chronology off-hand, I am thinking that, by this time, he may have benefitted from Joan Sutherland's instruction on breath control.  If so, he  brought those skills to bear here, and his phrasing is enjoyable.  (Thanks, Joan!)  He remembered that he was doing comedy, and he colored his voice to great effect for laughs at all the right moments.  All that comedy aside, there's a little catch in the heart in his love songs.
Blegen is cute as a button.  Her face is just marvelously expressive.  Others may find her voice a little small.  For my tastes, it is perfect for Adina.  I didn't even care that I couldn't hear her low notes.  She was so much fun to watch.
Bruscantini is wonderful!  Other reviewers have said it all.
I enjoyed the visuals of this production--simply but nicely done.  The first act harvest-time scenery has a kind of Fragonard look about it that complemented the muted pastels of the costumes.  The costumes were non-fussy and cute.
I'm very happy with this DVD.",1254268800,8,1519,4.652830188679245
8231804,4,B000YCLRAG,"This is a very pleasant performance. Pavarotti is involved in the role and sings more elegantly than was usual.  Blegen has a pleasant voice, acts well, and sings with style.  The sets are clever, and Rescigno conducts in an idiomatic manner.

The two problem areas are Sesto Bruscantini as Dulcamara and Brent Ellis as Belcore.  Bruscantini was one of my favorite baritones, he had an attractive voice, a subtle and nuanced style, and was a fine actor (for an opera singer).  Here he is sadly past his prime vocally, and really can't do justice to the singing.  Brent Ellis does very well with the singing, but acts the role of Belcore exactly as Benny Hill would have (including the silly salute and smirk) - very tiresome!

Still recommend for the wonderful singing of Pavarotti and Blegen.",1239408000,5,793,4.786764705882353
8231805,5,B000YCLRAG,"In my opinion this 1981 production at the Met is easily heads and tails above its 1971 and 1991 competition. First of all it has a wonderful cast who play their roles to comic perfection;Pavarotti himself is in his prime.

Secondly,the production design and Nicola Rescigno's treatment of the score capture the rustic, country feel of this Donizetti comedy much better than Levine in the 1991 production which I  had the great fortune to attend. Though that production boasts Kathleen Battle in great voice as Adina, it is a role of a young woman in love and Judith Blegen seems to fit better here. As for the rest of the cast there is very little comparison. Brent Ellis and Sesto Bruscantini give seminal performances here.

As far as the 1971 CD version goes, though there is some good singing here and there, I have never taken a liking to Bonynge who I believe had very little understanding of music, but had a great business sense and bedside manner. His treatment of both his wife's singing or a score make nearly any work of his unlistenable for me. Dame Joan had one of the greatest voices ever but couldn't pronounce a lick of what she was singing in most everything she recorded with her husband including the '71 elisir. Pavarotti on the other hand was unimpeachable in this regard.

In conclusion, this production is the closest thing to what I think Donizetti must have had in mind when he wrote the score. This also contains beyond any doubt or criticism the absolute BEST recorded version of ""Una Furtiva Lagrima"" available.",1232150400,7,1540,4.713754646840148
8231806,5,B000YCLRAG,"Love this one!!!

This is the role that Pavarotti most identified with and it shows. He is absolutely magnificent. From his first aria, ""Quanto  bella,"" to ""Una Furtiva Lagrima,"" his voice is pure perfection. Not only that, but his acting is superb and his comic timing is right on the mark. He is young, limber and energetic in this version. This opera reminds us of why he was the golden tenor of a generation and the greatest voice of the century. If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  Highly, highly recommended.",1229472000,12,517,4.537634408602151
