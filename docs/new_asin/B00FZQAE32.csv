8619775,5,B00FZQAE32,"This is a made for TV, Italian film that was done in two parts. It was a follow up to Corleone, but you do not need to see the first one as this is all self contained. It depicts the last days of Bernardo Provenzano (Michele Placido) the last Godfather or Uncle as he was actually called on the run in his native Scicily.

After years of being hunted he is now moving from safe house to safe house, coping with cancer of the prostate and a crime empire that is in danger of self destruction. He was one of the architects of the war that ripped the family apart and waged war on the State. He is one of the only survivors of the old guard and has to be one step ahead of the police. He also is trying to stop another war breaking out- realising as he does that war is bad for business. The cops meanwhile are throwing all they have at the situation to get him arrested. We see their story being played out too with the emotional and physical cost it brings.

This is a thoughtful and well made drama which does not shy away from some of the atrocities inflicted  using actual footage towards the end. There is some action too but this is more along the lines of a police man hunt and I have to say it kept me interested for the full 3 hours and 10 minutes which is a pretty good effort. Originally released as Lultimo padrino it is in Italian with some French; this then is an excellent piece of Italian television that I can easily recommend.

PS I have no idea what the sweets are like as I only saw the film.",1388880000,,1510,4.1084745762711865
