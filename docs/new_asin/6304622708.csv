903558,3,6304622708,"Unless the previous reviewers were too harsh and I too lenient, Simitar may have revised their DVD release of THE ROYAL HUNT OF THE SUN.  The version I saw was part of a two-pack featuring it and THE FIFTH DAY OF  PEACE in Amaray-type keep cases.  Anyhow, the picture is letterboxed, but  crops off a bit of the right, evidenced early on by the title reading  ""Christoph(er) Plumme(r)"" and Robert Shaw being cut off when he  stands too far to the right.  Yes, the print shows damage in the form of  scratches, artifacts, and bad splices, along with faded colors and a  picture lacking sharpness.  The audio is in unexceptional Linear PCM.  But  get this: the bars are honest to goodness BLACK!  In my opinion, it's  staill quite watchable, not at all the horrid and incomprehensible mess  described by others.  The outstanding cast, scenic Spanish locations,  energetic score, and resouceful production designing by Eugene Lourie  elevate this film far beyond its low budget roots as well as the  deficiencies of this video presentation.  THE ROYAL HUNT OF THE SUN is a  fine movie that certainly deserves better, much better.  But as it stands,  the DVD is okay...for now.  A final note, the DVD clocks in at 95 minutes,  not the 88 printed on the cover.",944352000,27,1255,4.725581395348837
903559,1,6304622708,"I saw the other reviews of the quality of this video, too late. I put it in my VCR and it is true, the worst video transfer ever. What a shame. You get a tape brand new and it looks on the screen like a 25 years old flea  market ex-rental.",943488000,12,239,3.6862745098039214
903560,1,6304622708,"When Peter Shaffer agreed to allow a screen translation of his Broadway play, ""The Royal Hunt of The Sun"" it was entrusted to the very able Phillip Yordan and a stellar cast (some from the original stage cast).  Unfortunately, this is the type of issue that can and will give DVD a bad  name. The producers of the DVD, Simitar Entertainment, utilized a print  that was obviously stored in someone's garage and dragged through the  streets frame by frame before the transfer was attempted. I've never seen  so many breaks, missing frames and scratches in my history of collecting  (which goes back to 16mm in the 50's). The sound is either poor optical or  lousy magnetic mono, take your pick. The Sound Simply Sucks! The picture  quality is marginal and the overall experience of seeing this film again  after so many years.....eternally marred for this collector. Despite  Amazon's real bargain price for the disc....it's a bummer in sheep's  clothing and the folks at Simitar should be ashamed for foisting such a dud  on a trusting public. Finally, a curse on whoever decided blue borders at  the top and bottom of the letterbox would be a nice touch. All that's  missing here are the cute squigglies the Italians and Japanese used to give  us in earlier VHS letterbox versions. Finnally, as if to add insult to  injury, Simitar adds box notes that proclaim how easy it is to play the  disc on ""your computer"". There are bonuses here too, but what  good is a cheap dessert after a lousy meal? In closing, I nominate this  disc for the international ""distortion in sound"" award. It's a  hands down winner!",914976000,8,1607,4.7328519855595665

903678,5,6304622708,"I first saw Peter Shaffer's (also the author of AMADEUS) ROYAL HUNT OF THE SUN as an undergraduate, and the film has haunted me ever since.  The inimitable Robert Shaw plays Francisco Pizarro as a soldier driven to conquest in the name of Spain, drawn repeatedly and inexorably to South America, where he believes the fabled City of Eldorado lies.  Upon reaching Peru, he captures the Inca god-king Atahualpa (Christopher Plummer, who played the role of Pizarro on Broadway) and demands a godlike ransom in gold for his safety.  Although the Incas meet Pizarro's demands, the conquistador is reluctant to free his prisoner because of the edgy friendship that has arisen between them and his still-unslaked greed.  At the climax of the film, Pizarro sacrifices Atahualpa in his quest for ultimate knowledge, and having also sacrificed his own honor, is left a bitter and disillusioned man.  Stellar performances by the two principals make this drama of conflicting cultures unforgettable.  Conversely, Leonard Whiting, just a few years after his role as Romeo, remains in the memory as a judgemental, superficial lackey.",1392595200,,1119,5.188888888888889
903679,1,6304622708,"This VHS is NOT 118 mins. long, it is the 88 mins and poorly cut for US theatrical release. A fascinating movie butchered for US consumption.

903680,5,6304622708,"Even though this is a perversion of some of the historical facts, the acting of Robert Shaw who died at age 50 made this a great movie for me. Christopher Plummer gives a great job but his direction at how the Inca would speak takes a while to get used to. Accurate depiction of how the Spaniards slaughtered the natives and the churches involvement.
A interesting look at how the Inca's religion (not sure of the accuracy).
Overall Shaw and Plummer transcend the film and at points make you feel they are on stage.
Poor quality film transfer but again Shaw (who believe it or not played the Russian British spy to kill 007 in From Russia with Love) makes this a great and rare watch.",1383004800,,684,4.436507936507937

903682,1,6304622708,"This movie is laughable beginning with the casting of Christopher Plummer as Atahualpa the King of the Inca Empire at the time of the so-called conquest, better called Hostile INVASION and multiple thefts and massacres ... But my comments are not directed to the movie but to the method by which this transaction was paid. Halmic sent the DVD and it got here, although to the wrong apartment who latter on delivered to me anonymously. In the meantime, since it was past the projected shipping time, it was declared lost and Halmic refunded the price of the item. Later I notified Halmic and suggested he do not refund it and if he had done it to get the money back.  He e-mailed that there was no way to re-charge me for it, so to my understanding he is going to lose that money. Why?  Even though the movie is worth ""caca"" I will ask Halmic for a postal address and I will send him a check.  I think somebody should check on this situation!!  The people that are providing us with whatever we find we want should not lose money on the transactions.  Thank you and good night!",1334188800,3,1076,4.414141414141414
903683,2,6304622708,"This is a great film, but all of the versions that have been released on tape and DVD are the same; they are old, choppy copies with sound and picture glitches through out. I have not downloaded this movie, but it is put out by the same company as the lousy copy marked as being released in 2010 on the Amazon listings. There are no chapter breaks and no subtitles or special features. It's just as cheap as they could make it. The 2011 version is described the same as the 2010 and 2005 versions, and it is put out by a division of the same company.

903747,5,6304622708,"I saw the original film when it hit the theatres as a preview for public school history classes when I was teaching in San Antonio somewhere in early 70's. I was entranced by Christopher Plummer's rendition of the trusting Incan ruler. For its time, the film-making was spectacular. More importantly, the film was an important one--one of the first to reveal the cruel treatment of natives.",1306540800,,390,4.924242424242424
903748,1,6304622708,"This is a remarkably amateurish movie based on an intense play.  Very poor and strange performances from what could have been a great cast.  Not to mention horrible cutting, and camera work.  Not at all what I expected.",1286582400,3,219,4.7105263157894735
903749,4,6304622708,"A really good movie with strong messages, Royal Hunt of the Sun is one of those rare gems that, I feel, didn't recieve its due (be it screenplay/script, acting, or costumes). Mostly authentic in costumes and to a large part attitudes of the day (the early 1500's), it was a movie I had seen in the theaters long ago that fed my already burgeoning interest in all things history. It tells the story of Francicso Pizarro (Shaw) and his treatment of/relationship with Atahualpa(Plummer): Incan Ruler and Sun God of his people. Based on a play, the story is chock full of morality nuggets: the evils of racism, the value of your word and standing up for what is right, and to some extent, the role that god plays in our lives and our beliefs. All this within the historical context of events that would shape the world and our 'advancement' in it. All actors play superbly. Chief among them of course are Robert Shaw and Christopher Plummer (Spoiler ALERT to a touching scene: of note is when Atahualpa, after having the word God written on the nail of his index finger, discovers the power and importance of reading and writing. He finds out that Pizarro is illiterate and challenges them to learn this wonderment together. This simple act of innocence touches Pizarro and is a subtle but great dramatic scene). A great film, but the transfer is horrible, with some words being cut out and a lack of picture clarity at times due to scratches in the film. There are no subtitles or extras either. I hope that a better copy is made, but like Atahualpa, won't hold my breath (if you see the movie, you will get this inside joke). If you are a fan of historical dramas, Shaw or Plummer, and not daunted by sometimes poor quality DVD transfers, then go ahead and purchase it.",1269475200,8,1767,4.577287066246057
903750,4,6304622708,"Translation of a play to the screen is sometimes problematic because stylized action is accepted on the stage as an abstraction of larger movement, but when this same stylized action remains in the film, the work takes on a surrealism that may interfere with the intention of the film-makers.  The same criticism applied to dialogue that is acceptable on the stage despite over-dramatization, but in a film it appears as over-acting and can be distracting. This movie is based on a very successful stage production but the translation to film was somewhat awkward.

Christopher Plummer does an excellent job as the Inca King Atahuallpa, appearing trim, slim, dark, and athletic. His slender tall frame is that of a ballet dancer and thus is perfect for the other-worldly Athahuallpa. Robert Shaw is at his best as Pizzaro. He is a bundle of masculine enterprise, an agent for state and church and self. These two figures are meant for each other, or at least Athahuallpa was meant for Pizzaro to awaken hidden doubts and unquestioned concepts and repressed emotions - of course Athahuallpa is destroyed in the process. Shaw and Plummer bring a slight bit of homoeroticism to the play, actually strengthening its many layers of meaning. The film reveals that 17th century Spanish Catholic explorers were exploitive and the implication is that the church and the state play a major role in this exploitation. The screenplay is vivid and intellectually challenging.

The film quality is a bit poor with jumpy editing that even cuts dialogue short. This was distracting since the dialogue was strong.",1251590400,4,1596,5.06083650190114

903755,2,6304622708,"This is an astonishingly bad transfer to DVD for a film that I don't believe is in the public domain -- it's very tough to get through.  It's a pity, as this is still an intriguing take on religion and imperialism. Shaw's performance as Pizzaro is both commanding yet convincingly conveys his credulousness in his new surroundings. Plummer as the Incan ruler with his petulant keening is more of a distraction.  He sounds like Olivier and looks like Cher.
If this were ever restored, I'd give it another go.",1207440000,3,507,4.685393258426966
903756,2,6304622708,"Terrible transfer, badly cut, chopped, savaged - a lot like Atahualpa himself, played by Christopher Plummer using some improbable modern invention of the high chirruping sounds of the ""ancient Incan language of the sun kings.""  It's hard enough taking Chris for the Inca, let alone taking him seriously as a bird.  Everyone walks about looking mildly amused and very theatrical.  Too bad, because it's a brilliant play and could be wonderfully and powerfully filmed - or, not.",1206403200,7,477,5.1688311688311686
903817,1,6304622708,The acting of all the actors are as stiff as wood. Most of the settings look fake. It looks more like a play on stage than a movie. I will never buy any movie made in the 60's and 70's again.,1194307200,4,191,3.682926829268293

If this movies was grainy and snapped, crackled and popped like one of those 1920s talkies, it would still be among the very best in my collection. I've watched this movie many times, and have never noticed the picture quality. Criticising this movie on the basis of picture quality is like finding your favorite book less and less interesting because of the growing number of rips, stains and earmarks. There's not enough stars in this rating to give it what it deserves.",1190332800,2,548,5.032967032967033
903819,4,6304622708,"This great movie is based on the incredibly successful stage play. The movie was not a big hit for some reason, despite incredible performances by Christopher Plummer as (believe it or not) the ""brownie"" Inca King Atahuallpa and Robert Shaw as Pizzaro. The script is a blatant condemnation of mass murder and slavery as condoned by the church. It also touches on the social issue of whether life in the world of the Inca -- where each person's life was planned from birth and no one wanted for food or shelter -- is better or worse than life under a monarch or even in a democracy. The Incas traded individuality and freedom of choice for programmed lives; the film lets the viewer make up his or her own mind on this.  A third, more subtle theme is the intensity of the bond Pizzaro forms with the captive Inca king. It verges on the homoerotic, which is an interesting take, particularly considering the historical facts. When Pizzaro refuses to execute Atahuallpa, De Soto asks (sarcastically) if he loves the Inca king.  Pizzaro responds by admitting that if he does not love Atahuallpa, there's no chance he'll learn of it anywhere else.

Thus we have a beautifully filmed movie with a great screenplay, great music/singing, and acting.  The only thing missing is a good, clean copy of the film!!!!! I've seen video copies and this dvd copy, and all of them have skips, a few scratches, occasional color distortion, and too-quick cuts in them.  Hopefully someone will give this excellent film the remastering it truly deserves, until then, this is the best available video version. It will irk you a few times when a word is lost or the film jumps too quickly from one scene to another, but if you are willing to tolerate these minor irritants, you'll love the film itself.",1189728000,52,1778,4.704180064308682

The quality is therefore nothing to get excited about (the colours seeming weak) - but it's OK - and at least the film is in scope.  However, this is not the film I originally saw in london in 1969 - which was approximately two hours long.  The present version on DVD is getting on for half an hour shorter - and is the worse for the cuts.  It may be that this abridged print was the only version ever shown in the USA ... in which case it is hoped someone can locate a full length print - and re-master it digitally.",1101513600,6,644,4.128
903824,5,6304622708,"This film adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play does complete justice to the intelligence and power of the original. While staying very close to historical truth, it is at the same time a timeless and haunting meditation on cultural differences, religion, loyalty, greed, power and friendship. The acting is absolutely superb: Robert Shaw's Pizarro weaves strength, doubt, lust for adventure and riches, and cunning combined with honesty and involuntary admiration for the Inca god-king he has taken prisoner.

The top honors go though undoubtedly to Christopher Plummer and his arrestingly magnificent portrayal of Atahualpa (incidentally, Plummer had played Pizarro in the Broadway version of the play, to much acclaim). He is in turn, and many times all at once, supremely royal, candid, touching, god-like, child-like, alien, eccentric, visionary and always masterful. It is a performance of such power and beauty as rarely has graced the screen, and the actor himself confessed that this was one of the roles he was most proud of.

There is not much ""action"" as such in the movie, which centers instead on the improbable developing friendship and admiration between Pizarro and Atahualpa, their conversations, and Pizarro's increasingly adversarial relationship with his fellow conquistadores, who want Atahualpa dead and the Inca empire subjugated and converted (with the Inquisition overtones of ""convert, or else""). Atahualpa stays serenely true to himself until the end - his conversion to Christianity before he is killed is not a renegation, but a royal nod delivered with a knowing smile to Pizarro and young Martin, who adress him as ""My Lord"" and beg him to accept the conversion in order not to be burned at the stake. It is Pizarro who is the conflicted one - between the Spanish crown that exploits him without helping him and the ruthless men of the church who accompany him on the one hand, and the peaceful and happy Incas and their majestic but curiously endearing god-king on the other, Pizarro's beliefs and allegiances are all put under question. His heart starts to believe in the man he has to agree to let be killed for the glory of Spain...

All in all, a splendid movie with a superb cast and raising some very thought-provoking questions. Highly recommended.",1098748800,12,2285,5.153638814016173

Too bad because what it's left of this film is really good. The english cast is superb with a special mention to Christopher Plummer whose performance as the Inca Atahualpa is really haunting. The slow motion technique used for the battle isn't gratuitous at all and is not only used to hide the fact that more than 2000 extras should have been hired in order to respect history.
