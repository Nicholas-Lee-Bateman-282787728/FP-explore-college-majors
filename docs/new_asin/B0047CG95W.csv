4284385,3,B0047CG95W,"I found the series of disks, more like stage plays rather than actual movies.
The settings seemed too staged.
Although the plots were good in most cases, they lacked the real Agatha Christie stlye I have got use to.
But they were certainly better entertainment that what is appearing on the television.
You could tell these stories were not her best... but they are good value for money",1301875200,4,386,4.6911764705882355
4284386,1,B0047CG95W,This is so bad!  It's like watching 70's tv soap operas...and why would we want to do that.  I think someone accidentally ordered too many DVD's and now has to un-load them.  I think I'll look into a refund.,1297728000,3,207,4.256410256410256
4284387,4,B0047CG95W,"These dramatizations are mildly entertaining if you do not have Poirot-Marple plot complexity expectations or expect the parts to be played by famous actors. In addition to being ""mysteries"" they are also good presentations of social customs in England about 100 years ago. Amateur historians or cultural anthropologists will thoroughly enjoy them.",1296518400,11,348,5.711538461538462
4284388,1,B0047CG95W,"Frankly, I feel that I was mislead.  I was expecting what A. Christie does best-mystery DVDs.  The 5 movies in the set are boring and certainly not worth the price of $32.97.

4284389,5,B0047CG95W,"Less known A.C. tales-as good as Poirot & Marple. Mystery/romantics judge them better. Stunning costumes & sets. Being period (20's-30's) suspense dramas--it's timeless. Intensely spell-binding, captivating. Each episode has a lovely leading lady. Agatha Christie is only outsold by Shakespeare and the Bible. See this DVD set and know why.

Set 2 is as good as Set 1, both based on some of her more obscure writing. No Poirot, but great characters, regardless. Five new A.C.Hour mysteries prove the diversity and romantic side of Christie. Yet there is Christie mystery.

Each episode is cast with several British members of high achievement and fame. The 5 segments give a great romance & crime mix, enchanting at times, suspenseful other times.
SUBTITLES are provided. A text bio of Christie also. A must own completion to Set one.

Episode details:
Magnolia Blossom
Marriage trapped Theo (Claraia Madden-Sense and Sensibility)is the lady caught in the middle of 2 men who desire her in this 1920's love triangle. Husband Jeremy (Richard Darrell) vs lover Vincent (Ralph Bates-Poldark=awesome series). Should Theo choose freedom or loyalty? Romance or duty?

The Mystery of the Blue Jar
Great show! Law student, Jack (Robin Kermode-Wilde) is the only one who hears a woman yell 'murder,help murder' on the fairway. Great golf scenes with vintage togs, clubs (wooden woods & wood shafts). Then lovely French Felise (Isabelle Spade-Rue des Plaisirs & other hot Fr. films) hears and dreams of the blue vase. She, Jack, and ""Doctor of the Soul"" (Michael Aldridge-Love for Lydia;Lion,Witch,& the Wardrobe), psychic, set about finding the answer to the mysterious voice. Fun Christie Mystery style end.

The Red Signal
Another psychological mystery & murder. Uncle/doctor (Alan Badel-The Woman in White; this performance aired after his real death) is shot after a seance foretelling death-'red signal.' Nephew & heir, Dermot (Richard Morant-Dorothy L. Sayers Mystery;Day Night Day Night) and lover Claire (Joanna David-Lillie;Pride and Prejudice;Bleak House)look guilty...but how? who? or who next? Jack Trent, Claire's spouse, Jack's friend, is played by Christopher Cazenove (Dutchess of Duke Street=awesome series) and the psychic is Rosalie Crutchley (A Village Affair;Four Weddings and a Funeral;Anglo Saxon Attitudes=wow good stuff).

Jane in Search of a Job
Jane (Elizabeth Garvie-House of Eliott;Pride and Prejudice) look-alike to Grand Duchess of Ostravia (Amanda Redman-New Tricks,Little Dorrit;At Home with the Braithwaites) impersonates at risk to her life for $$. Cop friend Nigel (Andrew Bicknell-New Adventures of Robin Hood) fears danger. Ambush? Kidnap? Death? Conspiracy? A mysterious caper! Quality Agatha Christie. Princess Anna (Stephanie Cole-Doc Martin=awesome x5;A Bit of a Do=see it;Housewife, 49=a must;Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day;need we list more?)

The Manhood of Edward Robinson
Fiancee to Maud (Ann Thornton-Hope and Glory), a geek and meek Edward (Nicholas Farrell-Chariots of Fire;Bloody Sunday;Twelfth Night)buys a sleek car and heads on a Christmas adventure at the Tantalas hotel. How better to start than with a gorgeous diamond burglar Noreen (Cherie Lunghi-Secret Diary of a Call Girl;Horatio Hornblower:Duchess and the Devil). A life-changing encounter & romance. Maud's mom is Margery Mason (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire;Reckless;Love Actually). Also Rupert Everett (Shrek 2 & 3;My Best Friend's Wedding.)

As you see, exceptional casts, the world's best books adapted well, beautiful period settings, and mystery mixed with crime and romance. All you need is the popcorn.

Some have said older versions of this set are available from England. Can't verify that, I can afford only one player, it's American. This set works well and is worth the price. See my review also on ""Agatha Christie Hour: Set 1"" a very good set too.",1291680000,45,3873,5.506734006734007
4284390,4,B0047CG95W,"Poirot has spoiled me. The show, with David Suchet's spot on portrayal of Christie's best-known detective and the stellar writing and production values it routinely utilizes, has set a very high standard for Christie dramatizations. Other adaptations of her work - particularly older television productions - may well, in comparison, seem to come up short. And I'll admit straight out that The Agatha Christie Hour doesn't look nearly as polished as Poirot.

But that lack of polish didn't dim my enjoyment of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Agatha-Christie-Hour-Set-1/dp/B003AND1TG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Agatha Christie Hour: Set 1</a>&nbsp;at all. Released in July of this year, the set has provided hours of happy viewing in my home and I'm so pleased to see the rest of the series coming to DVD. The entertaining stories are somewhat different from Christie's usual fare (and, in a sense interesting for that fact alone) and I found the acting and writing both quite solid. Made in the early 1980's, the ""stage play"" look of the shows holds a touch of nostalgia for me, reminding me of the Brian Clemens-penned&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thriller/dp/B000A0GXN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thriller</a>, a series I loved when it aired in the states in the 1970's.

The Agatha Christie Hour: Set 2 should appeal to Christie aficionados, particularly those who have read the short stories these dramatizations are based on which include:

//Magnolia Blossom//

Note: Lady Peter ""Harriet"" wrote a very helpful review (titled ""Another rip-off for Americans"") posted on the Agatha Christie Hour: Set 1 page concerning the release of British television shows and the higher costs often paid for them here in the United States. In order to save money and to get DVD releases earlier - or, in some cases, to get shows never offered stateside - she suggests purchasing a region free DVD player. The players can be found here on Amazon, but I know almost nothing about them and haven't yet purchased one for myself.

4284400,3,B0047CG95W,"I must confess to being an incurable collector of British mysteries, particularly those seen on PBS.  However, while watching episodes last seen some 30 years ago, I will admit that they appear stagey today, and that the sets were very low budget by UK standards.  The digital mastering of this DVD set is excellent though and brought renewed enjoyment of episodes like ""Jane in Search of a Job,"" and ""The Girl on the Train.""",1384387200,,425,4.72972972972973
4284401,4,B0047CG95W,"Set two of the Agatha Christie Hour was not quite what I expected.  I did, however, enjoy many aspects - the mystery, the period when they took place, and some of the acting.  These episodes were more of a Hitchcock touch than Christie.  That being said, I vow to always be loyal to Agatha Christie and the hours of enjoyment she has provided since she first put pen to paper.
P.S.  I did not see Set 1 - for some reason, the discs were not compatible with my VCR and I had to return them.",1376438400,2,489,4.11578947368421

4284405,5,B0047CG95W,Highly Entertaining.  My wife loves Agatha Christie and we have not been disappointed at all with any of the DVD sets.,1363132800,,118,4.619047619047619
4284406,3,B0047CG95W,"Dame Agatha Christie's best short stories date back to the 1920's and early 1930's before her detectives Hercule Poirot and Ms. Marple took up far more of her literary time.  In this five-episode set, ""The Agatha Christie Hour"" Volume 2 features the soap opera ""Magnolia Blossom;"" the so-so paranormal ""Mystery of the Blue Jar;"" as told in classic murder mystery style, ""The Red Signal;"" the mildly amusing ""Jane in Search of a Job;"" and the best one is ""The Manhood of Edward Robinson.""  This five-pack is really a mixed bag as two of them are certainly worth viewing at least once, two that are fairly decent, and one that is just plain dreadful.

Specifically, we recommend one should watch ""The Manhood of Edward Robinson"" first, as a hen-pecked young broker (Nicholas Farrell) flees from his fiancee and her overbearing mother to end up inadvertently playing a dashing jewel thief for an evening at Christmas time.  The likeably humorous premise is terrific even if the episode takes awhile to finally put the plot in cruise control for viewers watching Edward squirm in unfamiliar high-society surroundings.  It has a similar, tongue-in-cheek flavor as Series I's ""Girl on the Train"" has.  The other worthy recommendation involves a fateful seance in which one of five participants ends up murdered in classic murder mystery style.  Although the culprit isn't hard to guess, ""The Red Signal"" works up to the end when, far too abruptly, the villain emerges.  We had hoped for better things from the middling ""Jane in Search of a Job,"" which could been played more of a comedy than it was.  A British actress, with an excellent sense of situational comic timing (i.e. Jane Leeves), could have had a field day here with the paid impersonator concept.

The ""Mystery of the Blue Jar"" works much better as a story with a surprise twist ending vs. its extended adaptation portrayed here.  The revised TV version tries to put a feel-good wrap-up on to a coherent paranormal tale that needs its edgy finish to make viewers blink (as if to say, ""Well, I didn't see that coming ...).  As for ""Magnolia Blossom,"" it plays like a soap opera love triangle with characters of zero appeal.  This one is worth skipping.

Rating: 6.5/10 (Watching the video-taped episodes is more like live theater than typical television.  A rental first would be a wise choice).

P.S.  Consumer note: Although actors Osmund Bullock and Sarah Berger are listed here for Set 2, their production, ""Girl on the Train"" actually appears in Set 1.",1360886400,,2513,4.889150943396227
