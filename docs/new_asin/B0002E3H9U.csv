We use it at our Pregnancy Resource Center, teaching newly pregnant women what to expect when they are expecting and it is highly informative and interesting.",1445817600,,278,5.043478260869565
8027092,5,B0002E3H9U,my mother is a high school nurse in an area where teen pregnancy is very common. anyway she uses these videos to show to the young women who otherwise have minimal knowledge about pregnancy. This was the fourth copy i have given her.,1434585600,,233,4.441860465116279
8027093,4,B0002E3H9U,"I am employed at A Crisis Pregnancy Center.  We show Spring Garden to the crisis pregnancies.  They find it very informitive.  We have an outline of questions we ask after we view the DVD.  I like the computer imagages rather than life images, because some times small children, husbands or boy friends of the crisis pregnancy are in the room viewing the DVD.",1245283200,,359,4.650793650793651
8027094,3,B0002E3H9U,"This DVD is a great starting point to learning about pregnancy.  It does not go into detail as I hoped it would.  There is a lot of ground to cover and while they do touch on plenty of topics, the amount of time spent on each topic is very brief. If you want nitty gritty details, it is best to use this DVD in conjuction with other DVDs and/or books, or possibly skipping this DVD all together.  What I do like about this DVD is that the people they interviewed (mostly moms and some dads)give very personal accounts of their pregnancies and it gives you a more ""humanistic"" view rather than just a list of facts.  The medical professionals (or actors dressed up to look like doctors) in the DVD are very quick to advise the viewer to consult their provider about everything they talk about- which is very responsible, but can get a tad annoying after you hear it 10 times within a span of 20 minutes.  All in all, this DVD is a good ""starter"" pregnancy guide.",1218412800,,961,4.346368715083799
