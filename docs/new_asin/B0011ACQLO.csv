8241157,5,B0011ACQLO,"This is a movie that will stay with you forever..It examines, in a very riveting manner, the life of a lovely girl who feels compelled to love others, at her own expense.  The ""solution"" is given, and you must see the movie to see whether or not she finally gets it right.  I saw this many years ago and have been looking for it ever since.  This would be an incredible asset to anyone who seeks to unlock the mysteries of the teen psyche...a suicide prevention class would be a great place to show this, as well.",1361404800,2,513,4.268041237113402
