1397515,3,B000056HP7,"Well first off I would like to say that I enjoyed the movie very well and reading some other reviews, I have come to a conclusion that maybe I like bad action movies. Another thing I have noticed is that people are saying that there is other footage taken from other movies, I'm really not sure about that. One other thing that I had is that the marines uniform and the navy uniforms are not correct! Now I'm in the marine corps and it sort of makes me mad that they can't even make correct uniforms! Here is just one of the examples is one female is wearing Private first class Cheverons and then has officer rank on her coller! What is that! Anyway I just thought that I would share that with you. But over all I would say it was a good movie.",1093046400,2,745,4.144827586206897
1397516,1,B000056HP7,This movie was so bad (How Bad Was It?) that I turned it off after about 25 minutes. This is only the second time in my life I stopped watching a movie because it was so poorly done. DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE!,1052265600,3,213,3.7555555555555555
1397517,2,B000056HP7,"I bought this movie previously viewed for 2 bucks, if that tells you about the quality.  It looks and sounds like it will be the worst movie I own, and after I read the other reviews, I am looking forward to watching it...If I can get myself inebriated enough.  So far after 5 weekends, my friends and I haven't been able to get up the courage to watch this past the previews yet.
If we do this weekend finally, and it is actually good(???) then I will come back on here and post a RAVE REVIEW. If not, this review will stand.
Best Movie of the Day (when I didn't watch any other movies)

1397518,1,B000056HP7,"I will be honest I like Dolph Lundgren.........a look at his filmography you see B.movie classics such as ""The Punisher"",Universal Soldier"" and ""Blackjack"" Dolph has been going trough a slump.........Storm Catcher and the startlingly routine Jill The Ripper and the awful Minion(AKA Fallen Knight) but with Agent Red Dolph Lundgren hits rock bottom. Agent Red first of all steals it's music from Predator 2......and it's plot from Counter Measures,Oh I'm not finished yet. It steals footage from Storm Catcher!!!!!!!!! The scene where Jon Penner steals the  air craft while posing as Dolph Lundgren..........Now Penner is 5'11 Dolph Lundgren is 6'5 for goodness sake! yet they try to pass it off as Dolph Lundgren as the soldier stealing the aircraft for part of a mission.....This scene made me wanna throw up but I hung in there.....It turns out more footage is stolen.......I swear I saw footage from Iron Eagle  and Iron Eagle II.......I saw footage from Crimson Tide and I saw footage from Counter Measures........What the heck was Dolph thinking when he signed for this junk? I have no idea. When I was a teen (When Showdown In Little Tokyo came out) I thought Dolph Lundgren couldn't sink lower then Showdown In Little Tokyo,Then when I saw The Minion I was almost sure Dolph couldn't do worse........Well I pray he can't do any worse because Agent Red is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life..........This is coming from a guy who likes Don The Dragon Wilson. Bottomline:On Agent Red's cover it says ""Once exposed you cannot survive""  Take this as a warning.",1012435200,3,1581,4.93609022556391
1397519,3,B000056HP7,"Ok,a new Dolph film. Lets all forget what hideous memories that line produces in our minds! No,don't think about the minion,or about the last patrol,this is an entirely different kind of Dolph film...a good one! For Dolph gone are the days of Universal soldier,Masters of the Universe and the Punisher,he has been reduced to B movie hell,until now that is.
This film isn't too bad! The effects are extremely good,the plot is passable and Dolphs acting isn't too bad either. What really lets this film down are the other cast members! All too often Dolph s let down by lousy no name actors chewing the scenery. This film could have been far better,it could also have been far worse! If you're a Dolph fan,buy this film now! If you're not,get an early night!",1003017600,2,756,4.69172932330827
1397520,2,B000056HP7,"The plot for this movie is actually quite good, a microbiochemical weapon accidently created and released on the world is captured and is being brought back from Russia, but the Russians are trying to recapture it and release it on the major cities of the world and it is up to our ""hero"" to stop them before it happens. What ruins this great movie is the very bad acting. When asked if he knew about Agent Red, Dolph's character said it best, ""Sounds like a bad action movie,"" and it is. From LT. Christian being seriously out of uniform to the underlying ""love story"", this movie just reeks. The only good thing I saw in this movie was Randolph Mantooth. His small part made up for the movie in my opinion. So unless you're a big Mantooth fan, this movie is a waste of money.",994982400,12,777,4.36551724137931
1397521,5,B000056HP7,I only bought this movie because I'm a big fan of Randolph Mantooth.  I thought the movie was good and I enjoyed it very much.  Randy did a very good job as usual in his acting.,987811200,4,177,3.888888888888889
1397522,3,B000056HP7,"I like this movie.  I am a Randolph Mantooth fan and I think that he did an excellent job in this film.  OK, it's not an epic but I realy like it.  It's topical in this day and age when everyone is worrying about biological weapons and diseases.  It could happen. If you accept the premise of the film, that being the biological weapon, the film works on so many levels.  I don't like the underlying love story but aside from that I really like this movie.",987206400,,456,4.195402298850575
1397523,1,B000056HP7,"...The dialogue was so artificial and the acting was so poor. It seems that some one tried to mix ""Executive Decision"", that the bit when Dolph tapped the submarine steel hull to send morse codes, Steven Seagal ""Under Siege"" martial arts display and special ops background + calling off the attack of fighter jets shooting air to air missiles which miraculously changed into anti-submarine torpedoes but keep on missing the target. I never thought a Harpoon anti-ship missile could be used to shoot down a Mach-1 or more fighter jet. As for ""Agent Red"", well better spend you money on books on genetic engineering or microbiology. As for the containment room, a high school positive pressure cabinet has more chance of containing the virus, which were kept in glass vials so thin that they broke so easily.",982454400,,806,4.890510948905109
1397524,2,B000056HP7,"I never write reviews but this thing was so bad it compelled me to write this one. I knew almost from the beginning that it was going to suck when they started with a scene where the military makeup looked a lot more like KISS than camouflage. It got worse with huge plot holes, really bad action scenes and huge inconsistencies. Why is that the good guys fall down and die right away when exposed to a virus but the bad guys last minutes and carry on fights and conversations? How did they end up with 25 guys on the sub when it looked like 5 at the beginning? Nobody noticed this horde of newcomers? I'm happy to overlook minor inconsistencies for a good action flick but this thing asks you to suspend not just your disbelief but instead your whole mind. Crappy movie.",1497052800,,771,4.361111111111111

1397527,3,B000056HP7,"In addition to the other inaccuracies already listed:  the delta wing plane that originally attacked the New Orleans was French, Ohio class subs are named after states not cities, the missiles had no dispersal mechanisms for a virus.  You can enjoy the movie if ignore the many flaws",1496880000,,283,4.875
1397528,5,B000056HP7,Allow your self to overlook the plot holes big enough to drive an Ohio Class sub through and enjoy Dolph as he dispatches the evil terrorists and gets the babe in the finale.,1496534400,,174,4.303030303030303
1397529,2,B000056HP7,"The movie itself wasn't terrible for a B flick.  Dolph's movies aren't generally known to be ground shaking, but they're generally entertaining to watch if you like this sort of action flick.  And it is entertaining if you have no military experience, or can just ignore the terrible representation of the Navy and Marines.  As a submarine veteran myself, I really couldn't get past all the blatant inaccuracies of the submarine interior, tactics, uniforms or lingo.  This was supposedly a missile boat, but had aft torpedo tubes?  And surface to air missiles?  Seemed like there were more officers and Chiefs than anything.  Rank insignia's were worn incorrectly, Chiefs wearing gold warfare pins?  A mixture of ESWS and Sub warfare pins?  They could have paid any squid $10 an hour to straighten that out and had a much more accurate movie as a result.

If you don't get wrapped up in the details and enjoy yourself a cheesy action flick, then you'll probably like this just fine.",1495324800,2,982,4.86144578313253
1397530,5,B000056HP7,"Interesting facts about Dolph: He is Swedish, and although he usually plays a tough, dumb blonde, he is very intelligent. He holds many science degrees, and has a Masters in Chemical Engineering. He is also a top Karate champion, a writer, and director of many movies. The next one is the Expendables III, due out in 2018. He got his big break in the Rocky series...and gave up his chemicals.  :)",1495152000,4,396,4.577464788732394

1397549,5,B000056HP7,"Agent is red is basically about a deady virus that is being shipped from Russia to the US for safe keeping. However, some Rusian terrorists have a more sinister plan in mind. There are male and female fight scenes! Lungren shines in his action scenes. Don't miss Agent Red. I rate this movie 5 with 5 stars.",1197158400,,307,4.4035087719298245
1397550,4,B000056HP7,"The Agent Red movie is a submarine film, & it's a likable flik. Mostly, it's the American couple, Dolph & his Dr. Linda babe, pitted against the terrorist Soviet couple, him a Dr. and his Nadia. The russian terrorists hold up good in the film, and are battled more-or-less equally by the American couple. The Russian doctor Kretz proves to be a tough opponent, right to the end. But, you know, he is up against Dolph Lundgren, who is cool-as-a-cucumber on his every move. It's really an ok mfilm, just don't expect a Hollywood blockbuster when u approach it to see. It has an American war movie ending, and leaves u feeling ok as it finishes (I wouldn't mind being in Dolph's shoes at the end of this movie, w/ his nice Linda girl.) Break out the popcorn & soda, and watch the film unravel, as the planet earth almost eats 'Agent Red.' Recommended.",1182643200,2,848,4.512987012987013
1397551,3,B000056HP7,"As far as true action and supense are concerned, this movie is rather predictable. Dolph Lundgren has definately performed better in other movies, but he does an adequate job. However, the reason I feel that my $3.50 were well-spent is the 2 round martial arts showdown between Meilani Paul (Dolph Lundgren's U.S. Naval Officer girlfriend), and Natalie Radford (the evil Russian terrorist). Meilani Paul just looks so hot in that tight-fitting Navy uniform that it is very difficult to concentrate on the fight itself. However, the fights are both quite entertaining, as well as realistic-looking. In comparing the two female combatants, Meilani Paul is about 5'10 and 150 pounds, while confirming to a figure of about 36-22-32. Meanwhile, Natalie Radford is about 5'7 and 130 pounds, while confirming to a figure of about 32-20-30. The first fight begins when Meilani Paul knocks herself away from a male captor, and begins running from him. Natalie Radford sees this, and begins persuing the Naval Officer. Meilani Paul attempts to climb a ladder in an effort to escape, but Natalie Radford points a gun at her. Then, while on the ladder, the Naval Officer kicks the gun away from the Russian terrorist, and attempts to continue climbing the ladder. Next, Radford grabs Paul's leg, but Paul uses her other leg to kick Radford's face. However, the Russian terrorist jumps up, grabs the Naval Officer, and pulls her down from the ladder. After a struggle for position, Radford lands a kick to Paul's face. Subsequently, Radford lands a back-handed slap to Paul's face. However, Meilani Paul retaliates by landing a kick to Natalie Radford's abdomen. After this, the women grab one another and struggle for position. At this point, two men intervene, and break-up the fight, although the terrorist seemed to be in control of the Officer at that time. Result: Draw. Before the next fight, Dolph Lundgren meets-up with Meilani Paul, and tells her that she will need to defend the missile room from Natalie Radford, so he gives her his gun, and tells her he will be back. Over the next several minutes, the two women take turns firing rounds at one another, and hiding behind corners. Finally, the U.S. Naval Officer runs out of bullets, and realizes that she will need to take-out the Russian terroist ""the hard way,"" so she prepares for the final round of hand-to-hand combat. The second martial arts catfight begins when Meilani Paul sneaks-up behind Natalie Radford, and grabs her around the neck. However, Radford quickly places one of her elbows into Paul's abdomen, and quickly follows by placing her other elbow into Paul's quad muscle. Following this, the Naval Officer attempts to kick the Russian terrorist, but the evil woman blocks it. Next, Radford attempts to kick Paul's face, but Paul twists enough that the kick only glances off her shoulder. Then, Paul attempted a swinging punch, but Radford ducks out of the way. Radford, then lands a quick back-handed blow to Paul's shoulder. However, Paul blocks Radford's next back-hand, and manages to counter by landing a solid open-handed blow to Radford's nose. Next, Meilani Paul lands an effective kick to Natalie Radford's abdomen, forcing her to buckle. Subsequently, the women grab each other and struggle. Finally, the Russian terrorist lands a kick to the Naval Officer's face, which knocks the Officer away from the terrorist. Now, Radford has a clear path toward the missile room that Paul was defending, but Paul recovers, and manages to catch Radford. Now, Meilani Paul tackles Natalie Radford into the deadly virus, from which Paul is safe because she has been injected with a cure. However, Radford is not so fortunate, and Paul takes advantage of the situation by running into the missile room, and locking Radford in the room with the virus, which leads to Radford's demise. Result: Although Natalie Radford seemed to hold a slight advantage for most of the fight, she is killed at the end, so Meilani Paul wins. Although the evil Natalie Radford more than held her own against the heroic Meilani Paul in these fights, I definately believe that Meilani Paul would win a real-life fight between these two women, due to her height and strength advantage, as well as the fact that she learned some very real martial arts skills from her ex-husband. Overall, if you want to see a great, realistic one-on-one confrontation between to female martial artists, this is your movie. Otherwise, it will be disappointing for you.",1109980800,2,4490,5.004010695187166
1397552,3,B000056HP7,"AGENT RED is yet another in a long line of killer virus movies.  For a low budget thriller, this isn't too bad, though.  Dolph Lundgren, never one accused of acting, is even stiffer than usual, but in all actuality, he's not in the movie as much as one would think.  Hiding in cameo roles are Stephen Macht and Steve Franken; Meilani Paul and Natalie Radford are the femme fatales, and a nasty Russian villain played by Alexander something or other does a fairly decent job.

There are some tense moments and Agent Red is a real nasty virus.  Don't miss former EMERGENCY star Randolph Mantooth in a role as the admiral of a naval carrier.",1096934400,2,638,4.51304347826087
7932008,1,B000056HP7,"The ""acting"" was deplorable! The sets depicting submarines were downright silly. ""New Orleans""? An Ohio Class? TOTAL GARBAGE WAS THIS WASTE OF TIME!!! Except, of course, that GORGEOUS BABE lieutenant!!!",1518220800,,202,5.766666666666667
7932009,2,B000056HP7,"This was an entertaining film. The chemistry between Dolph and his girlfriend made the film. There were plenty of fight scenes and shootouts. I loved Dolph's funny one liners. There was nonstop action. There were a few odd mistakes. The main female Russian agent wears a terrible wig for the whole movie for no apparent reason. Also at the end of the film an entire sub of men are poisoned and killed. Minutes later not one of those dead men are visible on the sub. Where did they go? Nevertheless, it's a fun action film. The special FX were well done. Dolph kicks major butt and that's what I wanted to see. Recommended for Dolph Lundgren fans.",1506816000,,646,4.52991452991453
