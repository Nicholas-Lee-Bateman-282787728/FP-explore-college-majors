3522771,1,B001D262L0,"The only thing I learned from ""Trackman"" is-the Russians can make crappy movies too.  Dubbed in English-it's like the old Japanese Godzilla movies from the 50s' and 60s' the lip movements don't match the spoken dialogue.  The cinematography is ugly, the actors are ugly-even the girls-but Trackman turns out to be the best-looking of the bunch and his face is completely covered.

A group of Russkies rob some rubles from the Vladimer Putin Savings & Loan and after taking some comrades hostage hide out underground in an abandoned subway tunnel. They walk and walk and walk and talk and talk and walk until they....gasp!!..run into the Trackman who goes after them one by one with a hammer and sickle(okay I made that up) actually he uses a pick-axe and after killing he plucks the eyeballs from the victim.  Nowadays in a horror movie everyone seems to lose an eyeball or two.  By this time in the movie I was hoping someone would pluck my eyeballs out.

Two people escape but who cares?  Something else I learned from this movie-when two Russians argue one tells the other to ""chill out"" and they call policemen ""pigs"".

Ahhhhhh!!  Mother Russia where life is so merry.  This movie may cause another cold war.  So I vote Nyet for this one.",1225152000,2,1242,4.703703703703703
3522772,2,B001D262L0,"One thing that the recent Ghost House Underground label isn't afraid to dabble in are foreign horror films, including the ghastly Italian flick The Last House in the Woods, as well as this Russian slasher import, Trackman.  Trackman begins with a bank robbery gone awry, and the crooks with a few hostages in tow escaping into the underground.  With some inner-tension within the group of criminals, things get even worse when they realize that they are being stalked by a lumbering, gas-mask wearing killer who wields such weapons as a pick-axe and flamethrower, and enjoys collecting the eyes of his victims.  What Trackman lacks in originality and story it makes up for with some nicely shot moments and gloomy atmosphere.  Other than that though, Trackman doesn't offer anything you haven't seen before, or anything remotely original for that matter.  Not to mention that for an 80 minute film, it somehow manages to plod along for most of the running time.  Still though, Trackman isn't horrible, and is worth a look for slasher fans, just make sure you don't watch it with the atrocious dubbing.",1224720000,2,1101,4.956521739130435
3522773,1,B001D262L0,"I honestly couldn't get through this movie.  I had a chance to sneek peek it - and quite honestly - it just sucked.  Wasting 45 minutes was enough to just skip the ending and move on.  Now understand that if there is only 2 or 3 great scenes in  a movie - I will keep it for the sake of my collection.  But this s**t was just boring.  I even opted for the original language version - russian, I believe - but it still failed.  The acting wasn't so bad I guess, but the story was pretty much non existent.  I would say that any of these movies, be it ghost house underground, afterdark horrorfest, masters of horror - are all $5 movies and spending anything more is foolish even if you enjoy em.  My advice it to rent - although I haven't rented in about 10 years!",1223769600,12,763,4.101351351351352

8291339,3,B001D262L0,"Having been disappointed by western produced horror lately, I decided to venture further afield and look for some horror that didn't originate from the US or UK. What got my attention was Trackman, a Russian horror offering from Igor Shavlak.

After reading the synopsis, viewing the top-class trailer and teased with the idea of a horror movie from one of Hollywood's go-to bad guys: the Russians, I thought this would be a worthwhile purchase since it reminded me of Christopher Smith's London Underground horror flick Creep. Trackman brings together many elements easily recognisable as signatures of the genre: ragtag bunch of survivors being stalked by a near preternatural killer who is picking them off one at a time (and who looked to be a pretty decent villain from the poster and trailer), despatching them mainly with his nasty looking pickaxe and making trophies of their eyes. The chosen stage for this particular piece to play out on are the abandoned subway tunnels of Moscow and subsequently create a naturally claustrophobic and foreboding atmosphere for the lead characters to navigate. There is an obligatory backstory that is narrated by one of the characters to the others as they descend into the tunnels, neatly setting the scene.

Despite such promise from a much used and loved sub-genre, the slasher flick, the promising elements of Trackman never seem to come together well and I found myself fairly unimpressed with it all after it displayed a bit of promise. The location for the film had potential but felt too much like a studio production, as opposed to the grimy, dirty, real feel of Creep. The characters themselves are fairly two-dimensional and largely unsympathetic and so, the viewer is left with little concern over their fate. Those who are expecting imaginative or even gory kills will be left unsatisfied. Please don't get me wrong, there IS gore but it comes from dead or dying bodies mainly and the death scenes are limited; leaving me wondering if this film really deserved its 18 certificate from the BBFC. Even Trackman himself was ultimately disappointing, putting me in mind of the killer from My Bloody Valentine.

For me, Trackman simply failed to hit the mark. Judging it solely as a slasher film, it's competent enough and a very attractive movie showing the high production value of it; but it's no different really from any film of the sub-genre out there and the ending is a bit of a damp squib.

Hardcore fans of the sub-genre may enjoy this but Trackman follows a well-worn genre path with little in the way of real surprise. Looking for subway horror? Get yourself Creep instead.",1353715200,,2638,4.948081264108352
8291340,5,B001D262L0,"One of the first Russian horror movies to make it to North America, Trackman (original title - Putevoy Obkhodchik) is a well-made, well-acted slasher set primarily in an expanse of abandoned subway tunnels beneath Moscow.  The title character is easily among the best slasher villains created in the last twenty years.

Trackman doesn't start out as a horror movie, though.  It begins as a bank heist movie that takes some time to get into horror territory.  That may be responsible for its less-than-stellar reception on these shores, but I didn't think that taking its time with the lead-up story was a bad thing.  Remember how&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Dusk-Till-Dawn/dp/B004P7CN5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Dusk Till Dawn</a>&nbsp;started out as a criminals-on-the-run movie and took a good long time before anything remotely vampiric came into it?  Or how&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Audition-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B002GJWU0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Audition (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, for more than its first half, usually seemed more like a romantic comedy/sweet drama with only occasional jarring glimpses of the horror that would come kicking the doors in later on?  This is kind of like those examples, especially Dusk Till Dawn.  A bank robbery goes wrong and the robbers narrowly escape, taking with them a small group of hostages, and making their way into the aforementioned subway tunnels to try and find their way to the rendez-vous point with their pick-up man.  One thing after another goes wrong, and they find themselves deeper and deeper in the old unused tunnels, where eventually both criminal and hostage encounter a new problem: the Track Man, an urban legend figure said to stalk the old rails beneath the streets (complete with a variety of conflicting theories as to his orign).

The Track Man, a masked figure in layers of thick, dark clothing resembling armor, is a character from the same set of molds as Jason Voorhees and Leatherface, albeit inhabiting a very different envirornment.  He knows the city underground, and with motivations unexplained (it's a shame this didn't do that well outside of Russia: it was clearly leaving some stuff deliberately unexplained to explore in a possible sequel) stalks those old tunnels, viciously dispatching any who venture in.  He wields some unique weapons of his own design and is a hulking, powerful figure, capable of quite a bit of speed and cunning when the situation calls for it.  The criminals and captives end up forced to join forces to try and survive the Track Man, although the way that unfolds is a bit less predictable than it sounds.

In my mind, if a horror movie takes a lot of time getting from its opening to what would be called 'horror territory', that is Only a minus if the lead-in parts are poorly done and/or uninteresting, and neither of those apply here.  Good acting and characterization; a story that's well put together despite its relative simplicity; great special effects in the gore department; taut suspense; and an immediately memorable, distinctive villain are all important here, and make for a great, highly underrated horror movie that bodes well for the growing output of horror from Russia and Eastern Europe.

Incidentally, though I watched the subtitled version, the disc also comes with an optional English-dubbed version for those who aren't into the subs.

8291341,2,B001D262L0,"This'll be simple enough.  Russian bank robbers hold up a bank in Moscow.  During the robbery, Russian police come in to use the bank, the bank robbers freak and shoot two of them, taking the third hostage, as well as two of the tellers.  There's a junkyard nearby, which has an access panel to a series of abandoned Moscow subway tunnels, which they head into with the intention of throwing the police off their scent; they left a car outside the bank with its door open, hoping the police would assume they'd meant to use that as their getaway.  The brain trust behind the job was supposed to go into the tunnels previously and mark the escape route with paint, only he never made it out of there alive.  Seems these tunnels were used years and years ago to house refugees from the Chernobyl disaster and one of them is still here, defending his turf.

So we've got Russian bank robbers traversing the abandoned subway tunnels while a very moody mutant stalks the dark, making sure no outsiders encroach on his territory.  Naturally the six invaders are picked off one by one until there is no choice but to stage a last stand, winner take all.  To save you the time and effort I can tell you upfront the stuff in between the bank robbery and the last stand is all pretty much dullsville.  Come to think of it, the robbery wasn't so hot, either.  And that climax, that was sort of lame, too.  So basically, all 80 minutes of this 2007 (released through Ghost House Underground in 2009) movie was one long Russian snooze fest.

What you've got here is your basic stalker movie, a la STAG NIGHT in which characters you wouldn't normally care about anyway are forced into a situation in which no one leading anything resembling a slightly almost normal existence will ever find themselves.  I mean how many cities in the world even have a subway system, let alone an abandoned one?  Mine doesn't.  Nor do any of the cities surrounding mine.  So I can say without a shadow of doubt that there is absolutely no chance I will ever find myself trying to get through an abandoned subway tunnel, remembering this movie, and wondering if the giant mutant killer is going to come and kill me, then extract my eyeballs and keep them in a jar.  Did I not mention the eye extractions?  Yeah, they're not really shown, we just get a semi-decent look at the tool he uses, then at his jar of eyes back in his lair.  It's all pretty ho-hum just like the rest of the movie.  As I was saying, there's nothing in this movie's situations that will ever in a million years relate back to my life, therefore there's absolutely no terror to be found here, thus as a horror movie, TRACKMAN is a huge letdown.

Not only that, even if I thought there might be a chance, however slim, of ever being able to relate to the situation, good Lord, the movie itself was dull as p! ss.  I know the makers tried to inject some excitement with music and quick edits to give the illusion of action and tension, but it wasn't fooling me at all.  No amount of loud music or choppy edits are going to fool me into thinking acting that bad is real

Then again maybe it wasn't the movie, maybe it was the dubbing.

TRACKMAN doesn't just take place in Russia, it was made there as well, with Russian actors uttering Russian dialogue.  The Ghost House Underground DVD version is dubbed in English, and there's just something about the sound quality of the English voices, it sounds a little hollow.  I kept feeling like I was watching a RiffTrax or something, only not funny.  Seriously, during the first 15 minutes of the movie, I couldn't reconcile the visuals with the sound quality of the audio.  And it wasn't just that it was dubbed and the mouths didn't match the dialogue; I've seen enough dubbed movies that doesn't bother me.  It was the quality of the sound that did it.

On second thought, no, it wasn't JUST the sound.  The movie was crap.  The acting was lazy, the pace was lethargic--even with the quick cuts and choppy editing--and the entire story was just too played out to even bother with.  Okay, it's a 2007 movie, but even if I'd seen it then, well before I saw STAG NIGHT (which came out in 2008) , it would still be a worn out idea.

This is director Igor Shavlak's 6th gig behind the camera, but I never would have guessed from the way this movie was shot and put together.  Most of the camera work was handheld and while not ""NYPD Blue""-shaky, it got pretty distracting at times.  And in the spots where the editing wasn't choppy, it was still very very sloppy, sometimes confusing me entirely as to what was going on, where was everyone in relation to one another--hell at one point I thought about going back a few scenes because it looked like the cop they'd taken hostage was gone and I wondered if I'd just missed his death scene or what.  I didn't rewind, and he wasn't dead, just apparently had been left out of that particular shot.

Once I read the DVD synopsis, I pretty much had the movie pegged for what it was, and I was 100% correct in my assumption as to everything in the plot.  I feel Shavlak was trying to make a visually interesting movie, with his quick cuts interspersed with a lot of slow motion shots as well, lots of dark shadows and bright reds, but at the end of the day it's just another movie in which a bunch of people wind up in a place they don't belong and end up getting killed one at a time.  Moviemakers can change the location, can think of the most original and exotic places they want to stage their slasher flick, but in the end it's still just a slasher flick, and this one contained not one iota of originality.  Ho hum.",1341187200,,5643,4.41256038647343
8291342,2,B001D262L0,"Part of Ghost House Underground collection, Trackman (2007) is a slasher film shot in Russia (CCCP), and dubbed in English.  While the language barrier contributes to the film having poor dialog and kind of a rough edge, the major problem is the uneven pacing, and underdeveloped storyline.  Way too much time is spent establishing a creepy ""atmosphere"", before the level of action finally ramps up in the third act.

Trackman starts out with some promise, as a man named Splint recruits three criminal types to carry out his plan to rob a bank.  Unfortunately things do not go as planned, and some soldiers in the bank are killed.  After grabbing some cash, the three bank robbers each grab a hostage, and escape down into a system of underground tunnels.  The plan is for the three robbers, Grom (Dmitri Orlov), Kirk (Oleg Kamenshchikov), and Kostya (Tomas Motkus), to rendezvous with Splint underground, and then make their escape.  Two of the hostages, Olga (Yuliya Mukhailova) and Katya (Svetlana Metkina) are bank employees, and the third is a police sergeant (Aleksandr Vysokovskiy).

For about 40 minutes, the film follows the group as they wander noisily through the tunnel system, which lucky for them is fairly well lighted.  Along their journey, there are brief shadowy glimpses of the Trackman, a masked figure with goggles, carrying a pickaxe, reminiscent of the killer in My Bloody Valentine.  When Splint is found dying, with his eyes gouged out, the group realizes that they are not alone.  When a strange mist conveniently appears in the tunnel, it is finally time for the Trackman (Aleksey Dmitriev) to swing his pickaxe.

After this, the pace begins to pickup, and the herd is thinned down a bit.  Things get more interesting, when the Trackman sets his sights on Katya, and tries to strangle her long distance using a cord.  Grom manages to save her, and they barely manage to crawl to safety.  Somehow the Trackman remains close behind, and even engages in a little gunplay, before whipping out of all things, his trusty flamethrower!  Grom and Katya battle the Trackman at his hideout, which soon becomes an inferno, bringing this unlikely adventure to a fiery conclusion.

Trackman gets off to a decent start, but quickly looses momentum, dragging on for far too long before it finally gets going.  Even after the action ramps up, most of what occurs is pretty ridiculous, such as when Katya shows no damage after hitting her head with a pipe.  Other strange events are not explained, like how does a motorcycle get stuck on the ceiling of the tunnel, and then somehow get back down again?  Still, the action scenes in the final act are decent enough to keep the film from being a complete waste of time.  Trackman is a fairly robotic killer, who doesn't speak.  He usually moves at a snail's pace, but occasionally is capable of bursts of speed.  Character development in general is very shallow, with the dialog mostly consisting of senseless chatter, or people giving commands or making threats.  The tunnel settings are very inconsistent, and the structure varies widely.  About the only constant are the narrow tracks for mining carts, that run through the tunnels.  Walking through the mud, the cast manages to remain remarkably clean.

There aren't any spectacular kills, and the characters and killer aren't particularly interesting, so Trackman might be best suited to slasher enthusiasts.  The movie is disjointed, inconsistent, unpolished, and loses something in the translation, but it does have pretty decent production values, and a few scary moments and well shot scenes.",1300147200,,3610,5.001675041876047
8291343,2,B001D262L0,"Trackman (Igor Shavlak, 2007)

First: the usual warnings about watching movies dubbed into English apply. If you can see it with subtitles, by all means do so. The voice acting in the English dub is horrendous, and I have no doubt it contributed in a negative way to my feelings about the movie. Caveat spectator.

As Americans, and especially as Americans who like horror movies, we've gotten used to the idea that everyone and their mothers does it better than we do these days. Yes, America is releasing great horror films, but (a) rarely to the big screen and (b) they're small gems in a torrent of useless crap, a great deal of which you'll probably have to wade through to find them (unless you read reviews from Goat Central, natch, since I've turned you on to such delicacies as Lockout and Baby Blues over the past couple of years). So we're almost Pavlov-conditioned to see a horror flick made in a different country and think ""oh, man, that's going to be awesome."" Ware this feeling mightily, brethren and sistren, lest you get roped into watching moronic crap like The Ghost of Mae Nak, Frontiere(s), or the woefully underdone Trackman, an entirely unoriginal take on the killer-in-the-subway genre. As a side note: if you want a 2007 killer-in-the-subway movie that really, really works, look much closer to home: the Canadian flick End of the Line was miles better than this.

Plot: bank robbers plot to knock over a bank. Because that's what bank robbers do. Things go belly-up, and instead of getting away with fat stacks, they end up fleeing with three hostages into an abandoned subway station under a close-by junkyard. At which point one of the group asks the others if they've heard about the urban legend about the guys who had genetic experiments done on them who were supposedly shut away down here to die... and from that point on you know exactly where this movie is going. It's another mindless slasher flick with a couple of attractive ladies, a cadre of stupid guys, and a killer who lurks around in the shadows killing everyone in boring ways. Why on earth would you watch this instead of a hundred other, better slasher flicks? * ",1297209600,,2161,4.724137931034483
8291344,3,B001D262L0,"OK, let's get real. TRACKMAN isn't going to win any awards. TRACKMAN isn't going to win a weekend race at the box office. But TRACKMAN isn't as bad as some of the reviewers have made it out to be. It's really pretty good, especially considering TRACKMAN is a Russian attempt at horror.

The plot is fairly simple. A small group of band robbers take hostages and decide to escape through a series of underground tunnels. Great plan!! Right? Wrong. Very bad idea. A psychopath with a fixation on eyeballs lives in the tunnels and he's eager to add to his collection.

Let me state that I am not a fan of the ""torture porn"" variety horror that seems to be flooding the market in the last few years. I prefer a more subtle approach to horror. But TRACKMAN had it's gory moments and the suspense level was fairly intense.

All in all, I'd say give TRACKMAN a chance. Judging from TRACKMAN, I'd say the future of Russian horror looks very bright!

8291347,2,B001D262L0,"Remember the first generation of Russian rock `n' roll bands and how dreadfully awful they all were?  I have the same sort of reaction to Trackman.  The Russians are trying, by gum, but they seemingly have no idea what they're doing.  The result, at least in this case, is a horror film that disappoints on just about every level.  Ghost House Underground has released some pretty good independent horror films, but Trackman isn't one of them.  This stinker from Russian director Igor Shavlak just flops around like a fish out of water throughout its entire eighty minute run-time.  No suspense, no frights, and no entertainment value.

There isn't a great deal of story to be found here.  A team of bank robbers disappear into a maze of underground tunnels to meet up with a co-conspirator and make their escape.  Their plans for the ""perfect crime"" went awry during the actual robbery, so they have a trio of hostages in tow with them as they begin to make their way through the tunnels.  Things start to break down when the other guy never shows up, introducing suspicions of a double-cross into an already turbulent group dynamic.  To make matters worse, no one in the group knows the way out.  That becomes an even bigger problem when a mysterious stranger who wears a gas mask and goggles, loves flourishing his trusty pickaxe (but also has an affinity with flamethrowers), and sports a pretty impressive collection of human eyeballs.

The only real difference between Trackman and a long list of underachieving American horror films is that this one is badly dubbed in English.  As others have said, there's no originality in play here, the characters aren't very interesting or likeable, and there's almost no tension or suspense as to everything that takes place.  In other words, Trackman is a boring slasher film, and that's really all there is to it.",1254787200,4,1862,4.829652996845426
