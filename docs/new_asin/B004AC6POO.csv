8419936,5,B004AC6POO,"This is the first of a series of DVD's produced by Black Belt Magazine. An excellent resource for any Jeet Kune Do library, An excellent job by Sifu Lamar Davis, a second-generation Jeet Kune Do practitioner, (who trained under and is certified by five of Bruce Lee's students, e.g. Steve Golden and Jerry Poteet from the Los Angeles Chinatown period, Leo Fong from the Oakland period and Patrick Strong and Joseph Cowles from the Seattle period.)

Sifu Lamar Davis does an excellent job in in not only showing you the moves (as so many do), but explains the details in executing those moves. correcting the errors so many make. These DVDs as advertised, are for the ""Advanced Practitioner"", and I would recommend Sifu Davis' other DVDs he offers on his own Hardcore Jeet Kune Do website.

You will not be disappointed!",1361059200,4,819,4.801418439716312
