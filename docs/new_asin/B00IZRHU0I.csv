8646905,3,B00IZRHU0I,"The Spokane-born screenwriter Karl Tunberg had a 40-year Hollywood career, writing the splashy Fox Technicolor musicals DOWN ARGENTINE WAY and WEEKEND IN HAVANA as Grable/Faye predecessors to this film, and later taking credit for superproductions TARAS BULBA and the Wyler BEN-HUR. Tunberg produced MASQUERADE IN MEXICO for stylish Paramount, prematurely and needlessly rewriting the scintillating Brackett-Wilder script of Mitchell Leisen's 1939 screwball masterpiece MIDNIGHT, transposing its Parisian setting to less sparkling midnights in Mexico City and artsy Taxco (where ""nothing ever happens""). Tunberg preserves the bare rudiments of the witty Brackett-Wilder original, including bitchy interchanges between dueling divas, and this remake's ""enhancements"" are incidental Latinate musical numbers, nicely staged as Dorothy Lamour showcases but none performed in their entirety and ruthlessly slashed in the final edit. Lamour, a better singer than rivals Grable or Faye in tropicana repertoire, recorded ""Perfidia"" (deleted) and the film preserves snippets of the Lara classics ""Noche de ronda"" and ""Buscandote"" and Jimenez' ""Adios mariquita linda,"" conducted by the great Victor Young. Even the wacky Diego Rivera/Montezuma ballet, staged dizzily by Ann Dvorak in her Taxco salon, is interrupted by cutaways and presented only in fragments.

The film, shot by Lionel Lindon in wartime monochrome, falls directly between two important Leisen films, the lavish FRENCHMAN'S CREEK and the generational melodrama TO EACH HIS OWN, both exemplars of Paramount's and Leisen's highest romantic style. The devilish brigand Arturo de Cordova is held over from FRENCHMAN'S CREEK, very funny as a stereotyped torero with restless lecherous paws, and the underappreciated moustachioed smoothie Patric Knowles plays grownup comedy really suavely. Lamour spars bravely against the great Ann Dvorak, she of the long perfectly oval face, and La Dvorak (in cahoots with fellow snob Natalie Schafer, and most thoroughly on Leisen's stylistic wavelength) steals this remake decisively. Dvorak, Lamour and Schafer are all richly and artfully costumed by Edith Head, who went deliriously overboard on Mexican motifs, rationed fabrics and topheavy millinery despite her wartime budget. Purely for the sake of its fashions by Edith, this ought have been a Technicolor spectacular with full-length production numbers, artistic luxuries that might have justified Leisen's and Tunberg's nonurgent needs to remake the superior MIDNIGHT.",1503014400,,2517,5.95303867403315
