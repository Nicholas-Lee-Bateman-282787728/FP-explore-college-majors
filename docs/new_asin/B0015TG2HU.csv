8259806,5,B0015TG2HU,"I just finished watching Animas Trujano and was amazed that it is not more popular. It was a very good movie. I was entertained all the way through to the very end. I am a fan of Toshiro Mifune and that is the main reason I got this movie. I wasn't sure what to expect with Mifune playing this role, but he was excellent as always. It reminded me of how good of an actor he is with his emotional moving character. You get into the movie with it's black and white picture and great camera work. All of the actors are great and that adds a lot to this movie. It is not necessarily a happy movie at all, but it is a good movie. It was time well spent. The subtitles and quality were good on the RTC region 1-4 dvd. The little bit of extras are in Spanish. Mifune pulled off his character so well that I thought he was Spanish. I really believe that this was one of his finest roles. It's like finding a lost classic. Mifune has made a lot of great movies in his time and this is definitely one of them.",1366848000,,999,4.025125628140704

8259809,5,B0015TG2HU,"Animas Trujano (Toshiro Mifune) is one of those few movies that become documentaries with time. Reflects part of the history in South of Mxico, so is priceless. People like me, who were born in the northern region, close to the border, have different traditions, so I would add that this movie has a great ethnographic value for me and many people around the world.

OK. So Animas wants to be the host of the festivities so everybody can admire him, but his conduct shows otherwise. He is broke. Being a womanizer with drinking and partying problems, the only money in the house is his wife's (Columba Domnguez). Sometimes his older kids chip in, but there's never enough for all of them.

He talks his wife into it, and she agrees, but when he thinks everything is ready, his ''friends'' trick him with a beautiful dreamy woman (Flor Silvestre) who takes all the money from him.

This movie is also another piece where a foreign actor has a major role, like PEDRO PARAMO with John Gavin, and some other italian beauties who in their time, graced the mexican silver screen with their presence like Rossana Podesta and Silvana Pampanini, to name a few...
Toshiro Mifune's dialogs are very few, many hiding his mouth so we don't see that the voice we hear is not his (is actually Narciso Busquet's) but his acting is superb!!",1316822400,3,1323,4.669527896995708
8259810,5,B0015TG2HU,One of Japan's greatest Actor along with Mexico's all time greatest clasic director.  You can't go wrong with this duo.  I wish it was in full screen but not enough to miss the movie.,1272153600,3,183,4.352941176470588
8259811,3,B0015TG2HU,"Animas Trujano is a Mexican peasant who drinks, gambles and whores. Never mind his loving wife and several children, who live in poverty and humiliation due to his lifestyle. His greatest wish is to some day be an important man whom everyone respects (The important man or A Man of Importance was the English title of the film). That's why he would love to become the Mayordomo, the man who finances and organises a yearly celebration of the local people and who is chosen each year from the wealthiest men in the area. But for that he would need a lot of money, and the fact that people look down upon him doesn't help either. The film shows how he actually manages to achieve his dream, but it takes several tragedies to get this far and in the end, he must realise that having his wish fulfilled may not be the positive experience he expected.

Most people who are interested in this film will want to see it because of Toshiro Mifune, who plays the leading role of Animas Trujano. Although he didn't speak any Spanish, the Japanese actor accepted the role of a Mexican peasant - and played it very convincingly. Maybe because he plays an Indio (his dark skin, black hair etc. fit the role, Japanese or not) or because the film is in black and white so minor differences aren't as obvious, he fits the role physically without any problems. I have read that his Spanish was (understandibly) heavily accented since he learned the text by heart without really knowing the language. That's where one of the DVDs flaws can be seen. It is in Spanish (with optional English subtitles), however: I don't speak Spanish either, but to me it doesn't sound like Mifune's original voice - heavy accent included - was used, but that he was dubbed by a native speaker. I can understand how a Mexican peasant with a Japanese accent might be jarring to a native audience, but I would have preferred to have the choice between both versions since I know and like his voice, so this wasn't so great. But by far the greatest flaw is that the film was made in widescreen (2.35:1, scope), and what we get with this DVD is a fullscreen version. The result are scenes in which none of the actors are left in the picture since they are on opposite sides of the widescreen image, or there's this scene where Mifune's head is cut off since it would be in the left of the original image when he's lying on the ground. I think it should be very clear to the DVD-company that this kind of film will be bought by film lovers and collectors, not by the kind of brainiac who can't stand his latest action film to be with those 'ugly black bars'. Having more than a third of each image missing from the film is a violation of the beautiful images the director intended the audience to see. Especially in these old movies, images were often a well thought out composition, in which where the actors were and what the landscape was like had a meaning - and a lot of beauty. As it is, this definitely is a lack in this publication. Since the film isn't available elsewhere, I would still recommend it, but do hope for a better publication some day.",1241308800,11,3114,4.463157894736842
