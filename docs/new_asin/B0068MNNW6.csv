4978182,3,B0068MNNW6,"Don't you kind of resent it when a film is billed as a comedic take on growing old...and pretty much
fails in the ""ha ha"" department? I am in favor of independent films. But starting with a good writer
is paramount. It has been said that although there are some half million words in the english language -
being such an amalgam of assimilated foreign words... the vast majority of folks employ less than
200 words in our daily life. Here in this film we hear the ubiquitous ""What the f____?"", and the peppering of the oh so cool ""Jesus Christ""...( not cool at all ). What would we expect from people who all had parents to see to it that they got
a ""good education"", and thus, a job with some panache and prestige, like copy writers for an ad agency, and live
in costly homes, drive a Porsche, and play golf in Palm Springs. This is a study in an  ""insipid"" , meaningless life, with no kind of legacy left behind of any benefit to mankind. Sort of like waking up realizing that you're so old, a date would be like winning the lottery, and also realizing that you are, after all ...a total nobody without worth or value to anhone in partticular. A good subtitle might be "" What a failed life looks like "". I read a book some 40 yrs ago on ""how to write good"" ( I'm being facetious )..rule # 1 was never for the main character to be a writer. Yet we see this again and again. it would work if said ""writer"" had a vocabulary beyond that of pre junior high school. Contrast this to, for instance, ""Lady Killers""

4978184,5,B0068MNNW6,"I watched ""About Fifty"" last night with my daughters and a few of their friends. It was getting late and we kept saying we would put in on pause and continue watching the following day...... but we just couldn't. It was wonderful and appealed to all of us regardless of our age difference. I found myself thinking about it during work the next day and the girls told me they did, as well.
It was so ""comfortable""... I just don't know how else to describe how it made me feel....... and, yes... it most definitely made me feel. I hope more people experience this little slice of life you shared with us.",1352851200,16,602,4.383928571428571
4978185,5,B0068MNNW6,"It is not too often that I will watch an independent film a second time, but this one I did.  Plot, character development and dialogue were all right on the money.  Noticed some wonderful subtleties with the second viewing especially the scene with Alex in the motel room and her cast shadow on the wall.  This movie seemed very real and the ending was perfect.",1349913600,,361,4.523076923076923
4978186,5,B0068MNNW6,"ABOUT FIFTY is one of those indie gems that comes along all to infrequently.  This film has heart and what wins you over are the characterizations.  First of all, you will really love these two guys.  So human, so funny and so real in a way that can make you howl with laughter at times, and at others cringe with empathetic embarrassment.  The film moves along quickly with jokes, situations and character development.  I had the pleasure of seeing it with live audiences in Fort Lauderdale, St Augustine and on Grand Bahama Island.  It won the Audience Award at each as well as Daytona Beach and Amelia Island.  The standing ovations were nice as well.  But you'll enjoy it just as much in front of your own tube...just make sure to have friends there as there is always great discussion following the flick.  Nice thing about the DVD is being able to go back and replay the great bits that are throughout the film.  Grey and Pillsbury are a great team, and everyone, everywhere always asked about the sequel.  Wendie Mallick is a hoot and so vulnerable (for the first time!).  I don't think I ever laughed at the word Shar Pei before.",1329955200,3,1137,4.54679802955665
4978187,5,B0068MNNW6,"Enjoyable movie throughout - start to finish it held my attention. I especially like how it came 'round full-circle.

4978188,4,B0068MNNW6,"It's so true. You hit a certain age and 1) Your checking an box on surveys that makes you cringe, 2) you become your parent's parent, 3) you now remind the people you want to date of their parents (ouch), 4) you know that based on your portfolio you'll have to work until your dead - but at what?

ABOUT FIFTY is an honest and smile-inducing look at this unique ""bend in the road."" Simple, clear and funny where it should be. Wonderful story telling, great use of location and a fabulous cast.",1329868800,45,493,4.301075268817204
4978189,5,B0068MNNW6,"This is a road-trip movie that encompasses the spontaneity of youth coupled with the mortality of turning 50. It's  honest, funny, and takes us inside the life of Adam, a divorced commercial editor recently marginalized by the next generation of hipsters. He takes a trip to Palm Springs with his carousing best friend to unwind from a recent string of bad news. The two gear up for some golf, some time with the ladies, and an adventure that comes full circle emotionally by the end of the movie. Wendie Malick is delightful in a supporting role, and the film is well produced. If you liked TNT's ""Men Of a Certain Age"", you'll dig ""About 50"".",1329782400,13,644,4.6
4978190,2,B0068MNNW6,"""50 is the new thirty, isn't it funny how you never hear 30 year olds saying that?""  Adam is going through a divorce. His best friend Jon is single and trying to help him out decides to go on a long weekend to Palm Springs.  In between golf rounds the two 50 year olds meet a young 25 year old woman who introduces them to her roommate...her 50 year old mother. The two men then begin to realize what's important and what they need in thier lives. Lately I have been watching movies before I see the previews for them. It helps me to not have any preconcieved notions going in and I watch it with a more open mind. I watched the preview for this one, and I realize why I don't usually do it anymore. The preview is very funny and I was looking forward to it. I was very let down. The best way to describe this is if the guys from ""Swingers"" grew up but didn't really change (except they lost thier humor) and turned into pathetic versions of themselves. It could be because I'm only 33 and this is meant for an older crowd but I didn't really like this movie at all. Overall, not for me, but 50 year olds and up may.  I just didn't get it.  I give it a C-",1329091200,3,1155,4.03056768558952

Because the story moves so slowly and the character development is shallow it was a little tough to stay tuned. Needs to be one or the other: rich characters move the story slowly or superficial characters and the story moves quick.

Lots of us go through relationship difficulties and health issues in our fifties - these two main characters are there for each other, despite the fact that they call each other names and give each other a hard time. The two stars are really attractive, especially when they open up about themselves, and what they're really thinking. Great movie, it was well worth watching!",1394150400,,405,5.059701492537314
4978418,4,B0068MNNW6,"The movie gave me a sense of peace, hope, and a new, positive way to view my life. If I was 30, I might have found the movie depressing. But I'm not; I'm ""about 50"". It's not depressing - it just is. Its value is in the willingness of two more-than-middle-age men to face life as it was happening and to find ways to reach further than acceptance, and to grab hold of contentment. The action was slow because the movie was about people trying to sort out their thoughts, and to make sense of life the way it is when you are being replaced at work with younger, fresher employees, when you finally look up from your work and realize you squandered your family life, when you figure out that your folks aren't going to be there forever. The two men talk and think and engage. They come to good conclusions: conclusions that give them ways to look at life and see it for what it is, just the way it is, today - good and bad - and still maintain hope and life and a forward look.

If you are 30 watching this movie, you might be tempted to say, ""Oh dear! All those problems! How depressing! Why would I want to see a movie that had all those ""negative parts of life"" in it?"" If you are 50, you would probably say, ""Oh yeah, that's a typical week. I wonder how they face it? I wonder if I can find a way to live with grace and acceptance and contentment and honesty?"" ... and you would find the movie positive because the men finally articulate a new way to look at life's twists and turns. They don't stay depressed and despondent. The men regroup and move on. They decide that ""It's the end of the beginning, and the beginning of a new beginning.""

The opening scene is of one of the men plunging his toilet while talking to his forgetful dad on the phone and becoming very agitated. The closing scene is of the same man, again, plunging his toilet and, this time, calmly talking to his dad, who is now even more forgetful than in the opening scene. The movie was about the man finding his ""calm"". Good job.",1393632000,,2004,4.2297650130548305

One, a hyper-sensitive guy, going through divorce, and worried about his aged parent; the other dealing with personal crisis by behaving badly.  This is NOT ""Grumpy Old Men,"" by any stretch of the imagination.  The film is quite slow, actually, a character study of two middle aged men trying to cope with their passing youth.

The two main characters are played by Drew Pillsbury and Martin Grey, who also wrote the script, and do an excellent job with the lead acting roles.

Comments: I have no idea why Wendy Malick's photo is center stage on the ad for this movie or why she is even listed as one of the top two credits. Name recognition? I personally have never heard of the other two main characters or even the second supporting young female character. Anyway, this movie is a man's movie I think. I think you can see that men have been boxed and packaged as this movie shows two metrosexuals and not two real men. I doubt real men exist in America any more except in some guy's inner voice. It is sad that men have been castrated and repressed but . . . they kinda allowed it to happen I guess. Anyway the movie is pretty honest. It isn't like they are crying with their wives over the birth of a baby or shown spooning someone. They have problems. Guy problems. They are detached. They appear to be heartless but of course are not . . . guys just show emotion differently. And the movie attempts to show them/deal with them (problems) as guys would instead of how women think guys would. So all in all pretty accurate. It is realistic in the way it shows metrosexuals from LA . . . how they behave too. I don't mean straight guys who want to be or really are gay. I mean men . . . straight men . . . who dress up to go play golf or care about their hair and socks etc. That is metrosexual to me. Just shallowness and immaturity too. Doesn't apologize for it or try to lift it up as something to aspire to by poking fun at it. It just shows it. It is really a great commentary on how Americas are now after the baby boomer destruction. People dying alone. People being found dead by accident as they were single and alone to begin with. People knowing no one to put down as their emergency contact. And while I can't stand most of these foul movies I would say the one guy cursing . . . that was more art than just art trying to corrupt/influence. That is how a guy like that would speak I think. The ending was incomplete and not really satisfying internally. But I have a feeling for these two people that is appropriate. Who even knows if lessons learned here that we saw as an audience will even stick for these two. We don't. Mostly won't in the case of the single guy.",1374192000,,2374,4.206140350877193

The main characters, Jon and Adam, were right on in all their faults and attributes.  In fact, there were very few false notes in this movie except perhaps the Alix-character.  I had a hard time understanding why a beautiful young woman would come on to a guy whom she later dismisses as a father-figure, but it was a means to introduce Wendie Mallick's wonderful character.

4978786,4,B0068MNNW6,I can't think of any other way to describe it.  It was real life in real time and just real everything.  I can't imagine any one person watching it and not thinking of someone they should let know to watch it.  Comforting.,1372291200,,222,4.238095238095238
4978787,4,B0068MNNW6,"A slow-mover, for sure.  The plot is not the important part...getting older is!  As we age, it seems that the world around us is changing and moving rapidly, and we are just getting older as it whizzes by.  It is the dawning and acceptance of that realization that makes this film worthwhile.",1372291200,,292,4.576923076923077
4978788,2,B0068MNNW6,I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. It was so depressing. I liked most of the actors thats why I kept watching but if that was my life I would have committed suicide.,1371772800,2,179,4.0
4978789,3,B0068MNNW6,I guess I'm kind of curious. I did become bored hearing this man lament about being so old. It's a cute movie but I wouldn't watch it again.,1371772800,,140,4.035714285714286
4978790,4,B0068MNNW6,I wasn't sure were this movie was going to go when I first started watching it but it ended up being a pretty good film. Was a little slow at times but has a refreshingly believable story line! I would recommend it!,1371686400,,215,4.142857142857143

4978792,2,B0068MNNW6,Kinda depressing about getting older. Wendie Malick is in the movie for about 20 minutes. What a sad lives these men have.,1371686400,2,122,4.590909090909091
4978793,1,B0068MNNW6,"Boy, what a couple of arrogant jerks.  I couldn't stand the movie and quit watching about 45 minutes into it.  The two main characters are just a couple of middle aged snobs who seem to think that their worth is measured by their bank accounts.  Ugh.

I still feel I may have missed the point with so many positive reviews, but I don't think so.",1366761600,2,345,4.2615384615384615

8494832,3,B0068MNNW6,This is a coming to terms with aging movie that doesn't take itself too seriously while exploring serious subjects. It is at times laugh out loud funny. Enjoyable.,1436400000,,163,4.857142857142857
