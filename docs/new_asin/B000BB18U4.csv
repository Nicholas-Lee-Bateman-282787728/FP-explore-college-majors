A woman comes home and has tepid sex with her husband/boyfriend and then slices him and drinks his blood. The next scene he goes, has sex and drinks another womans blood. Next scene, she goes and has sex and drinks the blood of another woman. You see each person for two scenes each, then never hear from them again. I love low budget horror films and vampires films are a favorite but this was never entertaining in the least. If all you want is nudity you might find something to like about this piece of garbage. Otherwisw, steer clear.",1183075200,4,701,4.343511450381679
8084107,3,B000BB18U4,"This film is not all that bad, if you take it for what it set out to achieve. It is little more than a series of couples having sex with one of them cutting their lover with a blade and drinking their blood. The victim becomes the attacker in the next scene and so on, through about 10 different scence, a few lesbian ones.

There's not much more to the film, but then it is better than a lot of its kind, because it never sets out to be anything more; not funny - in a clever, or self-depreciating way, not witty - really no storyline to it at all.

The only drawbacks is it is thus very repetitive. Three obligatory 'shower scences' - three different women coming home from work, at various points in the film, each one stepping into a shower, soaping herself up... nothing more, then a few scenes later, its the next woman doing it, etc.",1135209600,15,840,4.24375
