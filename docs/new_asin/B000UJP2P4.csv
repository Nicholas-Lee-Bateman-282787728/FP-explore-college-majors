8213535,5,B000UJP2P4,"I am an aspiring animator. I have the original Russian version. I couldn't understand a word. With this English dubbed version is fantastic the feeling you get when you can follow the story.
I highly recommend this movie.",1393545600,,221,4.842105263157895
8213536,5,B000UJP2P4,"Our family had watched this film for years in Lithuanian, so I was excited to finally see the English version. I was very pleasantly surprised. The dubbing was pretty good, the enunciation clear. It is a shame that it lacks subtitles. As to the thievery, every time someone steals something, including the hero, something bad happens to him or her. Definitely worth watching.",1318723200,,375,4.968253968253968
8213537,5,B000UJP2P4,"The film was well set up and based on a Russian/German fary tale, when a boy Jacob is kidnaped by a witch. When he refuses to give her her demands she casts a spell on him. There is only one way to break the spell but he must pass many calenges on the way.",1224892800,2,256,3.759259259259259
8213538,1,B000UJP2P4,"I had hoped for a fairy tale with Christian values for my daughter, but was disappointed to find few redeeming qualities.  True, the images were beautifully done, but the story lacked dramatic tension, the parents show remarkably poor judgement, the hero thinks nothing of stealing things to suit his ends, and though I may have missed it, I could not find a reflection of Christ's sacrificial love for us, which is what I was most hoping for from the greatest fairy tale ever told.",1206662400,,482,4.738095238095238
