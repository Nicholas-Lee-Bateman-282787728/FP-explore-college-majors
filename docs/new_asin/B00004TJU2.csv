This is the first time I've EVER bought a gift for one of my Grandparents that they ACTUALLY LIKED. Thanks for the brownie points, Sid!",971049600,19,267,4.469387755102041
1350871,5,B00004TJU2,"The comedy is timeless! The new interviews with Caesar, Woody Allan, Carl Reiner, Mel Brooks etc. put the tapes in perfect context. My favorite sketch was the parody of ""this Is your Life"" when Harry Morris literally swung from Caesars body for half the sketch. I also loved the Three singing Haircuts! Gimme more tapes. Gimme Gimme Gimme. (And by the way, I'm not of that generation, I'm 27 years old.)",970531200,31,403,4.690140845070423

7922771,5,B00004TJU2,Everything I heard about  Sid Caesar from anyone who watched this show is understated;Sid Caesar's memory is a blessing and I know he's  once again cracking my uncle up  just like he did in the fifties.,1393200000,,202,4.555555555555555
7922772,1,B00004TJU2,"We love Sid Caesar.  We were impressed by the service provided by the company which sent it. The actual product had a clear picture, and excellent sound. The content, however, was mediocre. These tapes showed us his grade B routines.",1360713600,,233,4.825

7922774,5,B00004TJU2,"I wasn't much of a Sid Caesar fan until I saw parts of ""The Sid Caesar Collection"" as a fund-raiser for PBS.  I had never watched his shows in my childhood, but after seeing several sketches this time around, I absolutely had to have the whole set!
A few months later I bought the second boxed set, called ""The Fan Favorites.""  I play a tape every day -- a great mood lifter.
It is said that Sid Caesar owns probably 400 sketches from ""The Admiral Broadway Revue,"" ""Your Show of Shows"" and ""Caesar's Hour"" in kinescope (thank heaven they were preserved!) and I hope someday they will all become available.  (Admiral, by the way, was an early TV manufacturer, and the story is that their ""Broadway Revue"" was so successful they had to cancel it in order to save their financial resources for supplying the huge new demand for TV sets.)
The Caesar sketches are the first of their kind and have many descendents but no equals.  For example, check out ""The Five-Dollar Date"" (dated January 1949, when he was 26), a solo masterpiece from this first collection.  What comedian does such virtuoso work today?",1039737600,9,1101,4.625641025641026
7922775,5,B00004TJU2,"TV's Golden Age of comedy is lovingly preserved on these digitally remastered videos, and they're as hilarious today as they were in the '50s.  What a welcome change from what passes as ""comedy"" today...no edginess, vulgarity or racy innuendo...just laugh out loud funny stuff delivered with superb timing.  The ""foreign language"" skits are masterpieces of doubletalk, and Caesar's solo ""Five Dollar Date"" is a marvel of rapid-fire patter to rival anything that Danny Kaye ever did.  This collector's set is a keeper!",989625600,22,517,5.280487804878049
7922776,4,B00004TJU2,"Caesar was and still is a genius at comedy. But neither he nor his partners in the ""Show of Shows"" has to tell us that. This set is a true public service. Anyone who has seen 'The Show of Shows"" will get a kick out of this selection. But there's one thing missing: some of the side-spliting skits in which Imogene Coca appeared. I remember one in which Sid and she were ""Cave-men"" which should have been included. My only reservation of this collection is just that: not enough Imogene and too much self-praise in the interviews collected for this issue.",977875200,16,554,4.4950495049504955
