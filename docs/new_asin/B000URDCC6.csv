2924695,2,B000URDCC6,Very upset that beginning of film was different.  Scenes of Salzburg don't even compare to the sweeping grandeur of the camera coming up the slopes of the Alps to the alpine meadow where Julie Andrews bursts into song.  So disappointed that I paid $50 for messing with THAT.  Feel very misled.,1416787200,,293,4.705882352941177

2924705,5,B000URDCC6,"This film, of course, is a classic.  It was originally seen by millions of people in theaters worldwide worldwide; then on TV, VHS, and then DVD.  If my memory serves me correctly, the movie was panned by a few film critics in the beginning, who deemed it too ""schmaltzy"" (dripping with sentimentality) .  The rest of the world adored it.  Part of its charm was the location:  It was filmed in and near Salzburg, Austria.  And of course the music was great.  We still sing the songs today; a good example is, ""Edelweiss"".  This is one of the classic films that is a must for anyone to possess.",1409616000,,593,4.425925925925926

2924729,5,B000URDCC6,"I just love this movie. I never get tired of watching it. If its on TV I will watch it.  I've been to Austria when my dad was stationed in Mainz, Germany and my 7th grade class spent an entire week in Vienna which is a very beautiful city by the way. This is a movie that a family can sit down and watch. I sing along with the songs. Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer all of them did a very good job. The funniest part of the movie is when she is late to dinner and as she starts to sit down she lands on the pine cone and the children find it so funny. Another part of the movie is when all of the Vonn Trapped children are playing in the trees and their father happens to drive by and see them. I just can't say enough about this movie.",1387411200,,739,3.8940397350993377
