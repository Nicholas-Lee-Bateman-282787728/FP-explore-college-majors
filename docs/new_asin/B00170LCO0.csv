3166316,5,B00170LCO0,This is such a cool video.  I have been wanting to introduce my boys to some street dance moves and have only found ballet classes for their age.  This is a great fun way to get your kids interested in the moves and lingo of hip hop!,1260576000,4,233,3.9361702127659575
3166317,3,B00170LCO0,It looks like a cheap home made video and probably it is. There are no teaching methods aplied to the making of the video. My son is really into hip-hop but he didn't like it. Now I need to find a better product. Any recomendations?,1256256000,,232,4.177777777777778

3166320,4,B00170LCO0,"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. My brother actually gets up and dances with her! The songs they play are up to date and current songs and each dance is given a name (aka. ""the motorcycle"") and so it was easy for her to remember which was which. I will definitely buy the next one if one comes out!",1243728000,4,313,3.984126984126984

The video itself looks like it was made with a home video camera and some of the instructions/transitions are confusing... but bottom line - the children think it's the greatest thing in the world... and wish it was longer.  One of the best purchases for our after school program.",1235952000,23,357,4.758064516129032

With the weather getting cold, we are often stuck inside. I bought this video to use during P.E. WOW! The first time I put it in, it was like waving a magic wand. It shows the students how to do the moves and then they put it together. The students were familiar with some of the songs and enjoyed learning the moves. The students still love to do this and beg to use this video for P.E. Today, the chose doing this video over going outside to the playground and having free play. Other teachers in the school are going to buy this video due to the success it has had in my classroom. It has hard to motivate first graders to want to exercise, but this video has done just that! I would highly recommend this to anyone. (I have to admit, it's fun for me too!!)",1229644800,86,881,4.157894736842105

3166324,5,B00170LCO0,"Put some snap in your step and hip-hop your way to the store to buy this motivating DVD.
It starts out easy - step-by-step.  Once you get your eyes on this video, no matter how deeply rooted a couch potato you are, you will sprout up and start dancing.
School House Hop has captivating choreography, simple directions, and lots of graceful style.
The moves, fashions, dancing, and personalities will inspire flair.

As an added bonus, kid dancers teach their own freestyle moves. The DVD is rounded out with information on nutrition, and some active yoga-type stretching and strengthening. I can't wait to show this DVD to my Happy Feet Club Kids.

I played this cd a lot of times for my son when he was 4 years old and his friend that is 8 years old

3166336,5,B00170LCO0,"Easy to follow.  Fun for any kid who enjoys dancing.  My 6 year old doesn't do this quite as much as he thinks he has better moves.  However, his ""moves"" aren't real dance moves.",1365120000,,178,4.176470588235294

Roger G introduces one step at a time and then showcases young dancers that add individual flare. Many of my students cannot reproduce all of these skillful moves but without exception, every student dances vigorously and loves the cool Hip Hop music. This is elementary school appropriate.",1331424000,3,408,5.104477611940299

3166345,5,B00170LCO0,Thank you to everyone who has posted a review of this product.  It is difficult to buy a dance video without ever actually seeing it.  I purchaced this for my 8 year old niece based on the reviews and we watched it together.  The moves are well explained making it easy to duplicate something that would otherwise seem very difficult.  The instructor and the kids are all very talented and the instructor is very good at breaking down the steps of each move.  I would recommend this video to anyone who loves hip hop or loves to dance!,1291248000,9,535,4.418367346938775
3166346,4,B00170LCO0,"I purchased this and another kids dance dvd.  This one is the easy quick one to learn.  It's not the kid's favorite though.  This one has quick dance moves that are very easy to do and learn.  But again, it's not the one that my class likes to watch.  But if you want to teach a few hip hop dance moves this one is great for beginners or for younger kids.",1291075200,4,355,3.943661971830986
3166347,1,B00170LCO0,"Was forced to watch it with my kids. I guess I was brought up on totally different music, I must work on developing better taste in music and dance in my kids. This is bottom-feeding in dance culture.",1288828800,,200,4.2894736842105265
3166348,3,B00170LCO0,"Unfortunately the main portion of this video is only 26 minutes long, and half of that is a ""music video""-style portion where the kids in the video are simply showing off without any instruction.  So really, not counting the bonus sections of the video, there just isn't much instruction.  The instruction portion is just learning a handful of dance moves without any progression.  A few stars because the kids enjoyed it, but while they're interested in hip hop dance, they weren't interested in doing it again. As someone else mentioned, the video is *very* low budget and feels homemade.",1276992000,10,590,4.9393939393939394
3166349,5,B00170LCO0,"I was very pleased with this purchase.  It has modern dance moves and teaches the kids in a fun way.  My husband, who loves to dance, was even impressed by the modern moves.

3166352,5,B00170LCO0,My 5-year-old daughter gives this video 5 stars!! I think she would watch it 10 times a day if I let her. It is pretty basic so it seems appropriate for elementary school aged children. It provides exercise AND it's really fun so it seems like the whole package. I am very impressed!,1264204800,3,283,4.3584905660377355

We don't have any extra space in my classroom but I was able to project the DVD onto my whiteboard and the kids stood behind their desks and did the dances.  It was really fun! Everyone happily participated, and it kept them focused and moving for about 40 minutes!  Hurray!  I think that Schoolhouse Hip Hop would be best for grades 1-6.  P.S.

I would recommend this video to anyone who loves hip hop or loves to dance!,1291248000,9,535,4.418367346938775
3400843,4,B00170LCO0,"I purchased this and another kids dance dvd.  This one is the easy quick one to learn.  It's not the kid's favorite though.  This one has quick dance moves that are very easy to do and learn.  But again, it's not the one that my class likes to watch.  But if you want to teach a few hip hop dance moves this one is great for beginners or for younger kids.",1291075200,4,355,3.943661971830986
3400844,1,B00170LCO0,"Was forced to watch it with my kids. I guess I was brought up on totally different music, I must work on developing better taste in music and dance in my kids. This is bottom-feeding in dance culture.",1288828800,,200,4.2894736842105265
3400845,3,B00170LCO0,"Unfortunately the main portion of this video is only 26 minutes long, and half of that is a ""music video""-style portion where the kids in the video are simply showing off without any instruction.  So really, not counting the bonus sections of the video, there just isn't much instruction.  The instruction portion is just learning a handful of dance moves without any progression.  A few stars because the kids enjoyed it, but while they're interested in hip hop dance, they weren't interested in doing it again. As someone else mentioned, the video is *very* low budget and feels homemade.",1276992000,10,590,4.9393939393939394
3400846,5,B00170LCO0,"I was very pleased with this purchase.  It has modern dance moves and teaches the kids in a fun way.  My husband, who loves to dance, was even impressed by the modern moves.  I would highly recommend this DVD for any kids interested in hip hop dance.",1275350400,3,250,4.276595744680851

3400849,5,B00170LCO0,My 5-year-old daughter gives this video 5 stars!! I think she would watch it 10 times a day if I let her. It is pretty basic so it seems appropriate for elementary school aged children. It provides exercise AND it's really fun so it seems like the whole package. I am very impressed!,1264204800,3,283,4.3584905660377355
3400850,5,B00170LCO0,"I teach first grade and yesterday it was raining so we couldn't go out for P.E.  I put this DVD on and the kids loved it!  We don't have any extra space in my classroom but I was able to project the DVD onto my whiteboard and the kids stood behind their desks and did the dances.  It was really fun! Everyone happily participated, and it kept them focused and moving for about 40 minutes!  Hurray!  I think that Schoolhouse Hip Hop would be best for grades 1-6.  P.S. If you're a parent reading this, it would make a great gift for your child's teacher!",1263427200,5,553,4.219047619047619
3400851,5,B00170LCO0,This fun hip hop DVD has my granddaughters all moving and grooving! The 8 year old and 3 year old love learning the cool dance moves step by step. The 9 month old just loves the bouncy music and dances in her little chair! Granny has even tried to busta move here and there with the easy to follow instructions!,1262131200,4,311,4.2

8264521,1,B00170LCO0,"We tried on rainy day p.e. yesterday, and kids were excited, but after making thru warm-up, snap, and motorcycle sections, kids were not engaged, not breaking a sweat, and wished for something that had less watching others dance, and more dancing for watchers. Our school has dance teacher K-3 during p.e. so when get to 4th they know how to dance, and this was boring and lacked movement for them. They were glad I changed dvd to Billy Blanks",1453507200,,443,4.620253164556962
