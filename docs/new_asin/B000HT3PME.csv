8141225,5,B000HT3PME,"I ordered this late, and as they didn't offer expedited shipping for this product, I was worried that it might not come in time for Mother's Day.  However, I was excited to find it in the mail in about 3 days, and just in time for Mother's Day! It arrived new and never opened, still in the plastic wrap.  We've only watched ""The Sound of Music"" so far, but the quality was excellent! The price was great, and the quality was just as great as any movie I've ever purchased from a regular store.  I'd definitely recommend this seller! Thank you!",1371081600,,544,4.366336633663367
8141226,5,B000HT3PME,"The day I purchased this product, I had intended to buy Mrs. Doubtfire alone, but to my surprise I saw this collection of wonderful movies all in one and at a great deal too.  If you don't mind missing all the special features that comes with DVD's these days this collection is for you.  The picture quality to all the movies are great, but The Sound of Music takes your breath away.",1284768000,4,384,4.319444444444445
8141227,4,B000HT3PME,"These movies were a good deal to buy together.  But as a Christian I was shocked at the Cuss words in Mrs. Doubtfire.  I won't let my children watch it anymore and I had forgotten How God's name is taken in vain.  The Man From Snowy River was great.  The night we watched it part 2 came on the Hallmark channel so it was perfect.  Movies with good values, action, and character are hard to find these days.

The Sound of Music was beautiful.

I haven't watched Dr. Doolitle but I just hope and pray for God to be glorified and respected in all movies.  I just don't understand why anyone would intentionally blaspheme God in a movie.

Still a good deal for 1 or 2 movies!",1170028800,11,671,4.2204724409448815
