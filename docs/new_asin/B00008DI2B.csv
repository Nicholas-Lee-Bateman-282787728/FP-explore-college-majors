7981954,1,B00008DI2B,"The customer reviews that precede this one have nothing to do with the product on this page; they're for a film made in the 1970's which is sold elsewhere on Amazon. THIS page is for a British television anthology series that was supposed to be a follow-up to the popular Hammer House of Horror. This one (which I'm trying to get hold of) never actually aired and was rather recently released in two sets for the home video market here and in the UK. I can't rate the series or the release since I've never seen it, but I can certainly assign a single star based on the obtuseness of a particular online purveyor of goods and its inability to get things straight EVEN AFTER THE ERROR IS CITED.",1147046400,16,693,4.37984496124031
