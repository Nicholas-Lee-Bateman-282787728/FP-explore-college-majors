1092961,5,6305914818,"ROAD TO BALI is the Road picture which shows off the cast with a lot of razzle-dazzle color; otherwise, it is a relaxing, laughable movie of more Crosby and Hope folksy humor. Any parent who does not show off this movie to the kids or grandkids ought to be horsewhipped.  It is a funny movie of a time when certain actors and actresses had an honest appeal to fans.  Certainly Crosby and Hope belonged in that class. My wife nearly choked with laughter when the boys performed their bagpipe duet. I nearly feel off the sofa laughing  when the boys escaped from a shotgun wedding.  It is that kind of movie. Very, very funny.",998265600,2,624,4.447368421052632
1092962,4,6305914818,"If you like the old road movies with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope you'll love this one.  Full of bad slapstick, corny jokes and singing for absolutely no reason what so ever.  Bing and Bob go for the gold for Dorothy Lamour.  Plenty of mishaps along the way, even an amorous gorilla after both Crosby and Hope. For a film from 1952, the color and sound have held up wonderfully.  Definitely a great value at this price.  However, don't expect two road movies on this disc.  The second Road to Hollywood is a short film that is a fictional biography of Bing Crosby's rise to fame.  The film is terrible, image is poor, and audio cuts out completely in some places.

But this version, released through Brentwood Entertainment, is part of the ""Bob Hope Collection"" (although a disclaimer says Bob Hope himself has nothing to do with the release of these films). Unlike the previous version(s) this release has a good picture and beautiful color. It can be purchased separarely or in a collection with other Hope films (some better than others).

1092964,3,6305914818,"The seven ""Road"" pictures, starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour, are among the funniest films I think this country ever produced, and ROAD TO BALI is one of the best in the series. The first four titles in this series (SINGAPORE, ZANZIBAR, MOROCCO and UTOPIA) have previously been avaulable from MCA/Universal and are of siperior quality. ROAD TO RIO was owned by Hope himself and that and several other Hope starrers were put out by RCA/Columbia about a decade ago.
Unfortuneately this title has been in the public domain for so long and there have been many cheap-o video releases of it through the years. I was really looking forward to the DVD release, especially when I learned the trrailers for 6 of the 7 films were included. The price is cheap - but then so is the quality. Some of the trailers are grossly incomplete, and the film itself on this DVD ends abruptly. This is also the only color entry in the sries, but the color on this DVD is so washed out, as to be almost nonexistant. I think the film is still funny, but I can't recommend this version either - and the many topical references and Hollywood in-jokes may prove elusive for today's youth market. We'll see, however, if 50 years down the road the comedy of current stars Adam Sandler and Pauly Shore holds up as well.",962236800,27,1304,4.553191489361702

This was the last ""Road to"" film that Bob and Bing made. In my opinion it is the best, though they are all great. In this picture we find Bob(Harold) and Bing(George) as entertainers on stage. In the opening scene they are being hounded by fathers who are prepared to have shotgun weddings for their daughters. They escape and try to take a train out of town. There is a funny scene with Bob riding below the car and Bing in the car. The fathers find them on the train and they literally jump off the train. They hike to find their way to anywhere, and end up with sheep. At the market for the sheep they have grown beards and find that they are at the end of their ride. Looking for work, they enlist each other as divers for a prince. They end up on an island on the way to Bali where they meet the princess LaLa(Dorthy Lamour). She warns them about the killer squid they will face if they dive for her nefarious brother. They dive, find the treasure, and escape. They end up on an island replete with natives, a tiger, apes and crocodiles. After spending the night hearing the tiger fight with the ape and being abducted by the apes wife, they are captured by the natives. These natives are cannibals. Soon, Princess LaLa befriends the high priest who knew her father, he is willing to marry her to both George and Harold. But, her evil brother is on the island and he has convinced the king to marry his sister and to turn both George and Harold into shrunken heads on the ends of bedposts. There is a funny scene where the king marries George and Harold to each other. Things get hectic and the volcano explodes. How it ends you will have to buy the movie to find out.

***Spoiler Alert Over***

This is a great entry into the ""Road to"" series. I highly recommend it. If you like Bob and Bing together, you will love this. If you like comedy and drama with singing this is the movie for you.

1093402,1,6305914818,"one of my pet causes in these reviews is sequel advocacy. it drives me nuts the number of actually pretty good films (most obviously Ghostbusters II) which the Powers That Be had written off ahead of time simply for being sequels. so i try to do what i can to dispel that stereotype. but alas, even i have to admit that a given concept can run out of steam by the 6th go-'round.
you don't often hear Bob Hope and Bing Crosby mentioned in the same breath as Laurel & Hardy or Abbott & Costello, most likely because they were just as successful separately, and indeed already household names when they first teamed up. but even so, they had that same ""chemistry"" and were as solid a comedy team as you'll ever see. their periodic stint as globetrotting vaudevillians who keep stumbling into trouble - Crosby as the semi-loveable conman, Hope as the hapless but not quite innocent ""mark,"" Dorothy Lamour as the exotic love interest - would result in the apex of both of their cinematic careers. well, the better ones would, anyway.
through the early '40s they managed four gaiety-inspiring ROAD trips, to Singapore, Zanzibar, Morocco, and the Alaskan Yukon under the pseudonym ""Utopia."" today that would be considered a positively miraculous lucky streak and they would be advised to quit while they were ahead. but for some reason audiences weren't so passionately indignant toward lackluster movies in those days. (no, not even sequels.) why? my theory is that The Great Depression and the World War II - both of which were still fresh in the world's collective mind - were pretty dark times, so people needed escapism too much to quibble about how masterfully crafted a given specimen of escapism might or might not be. it might also contribute that this was before television, lt alone cable tv or home video, so the chance to see a movie was somewhat rarer. who knows, maybe it was that much more magical for it.
however you wanna account for it, apparently no one batted an eye when No. 5, ROAD TO RIO, found the formula beginning to fray around the edges. but even if they didn't, what had once been spirited fun had been reduced to rote and was now simply going through the motions. the result was a textbook example of the sort of ""phoned in"" sequel with nothing going for it aside form the fact that it's ancestor(s) had made money.
but as unremarkable as RIO was, it is Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and The Godfather COMBINED compared to it's truly execrable follow-up.
the most obvious problem is that the potential lesson of RIO - the formula needed a bit of tweaking somewhere - wasn't learned, and they yet again recycled their established premise. one gets the feeling they made in color simply because that was the one thing they could think of that they hadn't already done at least three times. (anything to get around the hassle of actually writing a stronger script.)
the principle problem, though, is one of diplomatic relations. Crosby's attitude toward Hope seems to of progressed from self-serving disdain to downright animosity. to be fair, he's not the only one. take the scene in which Dorothy Lamour explains that she's taken a liking to Hope because her childhood pet monkey had the same face. so it was the film itself that decided to kick the pick-on-Hope factor up a notch. but  since it proved easiest (as well as most logical) to channel through Crosby, his opportunism no longer has the wink-wink quality of the earlier installments.
perhaps this could be explained away as the principle bane of sequels in general, the aforementioned Waning Spirit Syndrome, if not for one particularly disturbing moment. Crosby talks Hope into diving for a sunken treasure chest, conveniently neglecting to mention that, according to legend, it is guarded by a temperamental octopus. however much (or little) respect he'd had for Hope before, he was seldom did anything deadlier than bilk him out of his money. it wasn't until now that Crosby consciously proposed what he knew damn well could potentially be Hope's agonizing death. (even forcing Hope to be a human cannonball in ZANZIBAR didn't make Crosby look so cold-blooded.)
and then of course there's one of the all-time least satisfying finishes in the history of movies. there are two girls, both of whom pick Crosby. asked how he'll hand the situation he replies, ""that's, uh, my problem."" this is downright sexist as well as being just mean. both of which it could get away with, IF IT WERE FUNNY. since it's not, all it serves to do is promote a mediocre movie's aftertaste from bland to bitter.
(Crosby remains controversial for his advocacy of corporal punishment with one's children. more than any film he made, this one make you believe he could've had such a mean streak.)
a less disastrous but still interesting goof find Hope's character being named Harold. as it happens, the man known as Bing was born Harold Lillis Crosby, Jr., so it would make more sense for him to play Harold. one wonders if maybe the writers intended it as an inside joke but mixed the two up.
in any case, this is one sequel that is emphatically NOT an equal.
as Fate would have it, ten years down the line there was one final sojourn, ROAD TO HONG KONG. despite having it's own weaknesses - most obviously reducing Dorothy Lamour to cameo status after Crosby demanded a younger love interest (Joan Collins) - that film proved to be quite delightful. it's secret was to do what BALI failed and/or refused to do, and apply the formula to a new angle, namely the then-burgeoning ""space race."" nor does it hurt that Crosby is back to taking advantage of Hope but not meaning him any genuine harm. in contrast to the aforementioned octopus business, Crosby actually feels guilty about getting Hope in an accident that costs him his memory.
in other words, after BALI shakes your faith in sequels, HONG KONG will reaffirm it. the franchise managed to bounce back and go out on a higher note that it might've.",1406332800,,5961,4.753861003861004

ROAD TO BALI (1952) is the sixth of seven Crosby, Hope & Lamour ""Road"" pictures and the only one in Technicolor.

Although a decade removed from their first, the boys are looking well-preserved and they've lost none of that great comic timing. They make scripted dialogue sound ad-libbed; not easy to do on Take 23. Dotty Lamour doesn't fare as well; she has a matronly figure and is without a memorable song spotlight.

One change is the supporting cast isn't as strong as in previous excursions. Most notable is Ralph Moody in a native role.

The cameos are still great.
Bogie appears as Charlie Allnut (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-AFRICAN-QUEEN/dp/B00AEFXD1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE AFRICAN QUEEN</a>), Bob Crosby gets a ""shot"" in his big brother's picture, Barrie Chase does an exotic dance, Michael Ansara is a guard. Also here are the hot comedy duo of Martin & Lewis, plus Carolyn Jones and Jane Russell for some eye candy.

Director Hal Walker was also behind the camera for the funniest Road movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ROAD-TO-UTOPIA/dp/B00005UMF9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ROAD TO UTOPIA</a>&nbsp;(1945).

This time out, Bob and Bing (as usual) are song-and-dance men who are on the run from various marriage proposals (also, as usual). They take jobs as deep sea divers and along the way both get romantically involved with a Balinese princess (Lamour), who in the end must choose which of them to marry.",1396483200,,2015,5.633663366336633

That kind of irnoy happens in this film, but with a strong element of breaking the fourth wall. Especially after a fight with an octopus. Speaking of breakign the fourth wall, this movie has more of that than in any given Mel Brooks production. And it's just about two close friends (who are both stooges) who try to look for work, adventure... AND WOMEN! Oh, and hoping for a way back to America once they find a woman. It doesn't have to make any dramatic sense for an old-fashioned, old-school comedy (I'm glad this is DECADES before the breakout of such digusting raunch comedy like Superbad, 40-Year-Old Virgin, and Project X screenwriters were born). When two guys get hired to be deep-sea divers (and both claiming they're not the actual diver, they've got someone else to do that for them- each other..!), they go to an island paradise (""Is there girls there?"" ""What would paradise be without any girls?"" ""You got yourself a deal!"") and meet a royal bombshell of a ""doll""... who happens to be a princess. Only the princess is aware that her cousin's been trying to get treasure at the bottom of the sea... and killing off anyone who tries to get away with it. Mayhem, potential murder... and a whole lot of chaotic laughs. The aforementioned breaking the fourth wall (happens five times, my personal favorite being the very last time), tame sexual humor, and constant badgering of one another- oh!- and in the second half, a lot of homage humor to previous academy award-winning films (whether visual or audial), and all to end with such a laugh-out-loud comically ironic ending, my brother and I both couldn't help but guffaw at it all.

This movie is just plain hilarious!  I think it's the best of all the Road movies, mainly because of all the cameos and the character/audience interaction (i.e., breaking ""The Fourth Wall"").  You have to love a classic comedy such as this...it's just the right thing to do!",1303257600,,416,4.52

1093622,3,6305914818,"This is a somewhat thin plot overlaid with the motion picture version of vaudeville routines.  There are asides to the audience, and guest appearances in cameos, e.g., Humphrey Bogart, Jane Russell, etc.  You have a bunch of the usual routines.  It is a fun romp with Bob and Bing competing for Dorothy Lamour, and  with a few bad guys, an ape, a volcano, etc.  It's OK to watch, and has recently been on TV, but is not a five star production.  It is lowbrow humor, about on the level of the Three Stooges.",1281312000,,506,4.387096774193548

1093624,3,6305914818,"The last of the main series of ""Road"" pictures, possibly the last by Paramount, and the only one in color...which doesn't add a thing, because it's also the worst of the ""Road"" pictures. Whereas the preceding four were ingenuous in their in-jokes and silliness, this one is forced and entirely too ""nudge-nudge, wink-wink."" There are cameos of their friends, like Bob Crosby, Humphrey Bogart and Martin & Lewis and Jane Russell and several others, probably. The songs were entirely unmemorable. In fact, I can't think of one of them! Probably the best in the series was the previous ROAD TO UTOPIA, or maybe ROAD TO MOROCCO. By now, it was petering out. Only one remained, much later, and without Dorothy Lamour.",1270684800,3,712,4.892561983471074

1093628,2,6305914818,"I was predisposed to like this film, but was disappointed in the weakness of the plot and the hackneyed one-line put downs constantly exchanged between the two protangonists. It starts with the two vaudeville stars doing their routine on stage, while in the wings a girl is waiting with her dad for a ""shotgun"" style wedding for either of the two. They escape, leaving Australia looking for any kind of available employment. It turns out deep sea diving is the sole remaining option.

Princess Lala, who is half Scottish becomes the romantic target of both suitors. The indingenous people arrange a marriage ceremony whereby both men are going to marry her, although neither realize they are sharing a bride. This plan is destroyed by another authority on the island who wants to make her his latest bride to add to his collection. It's at this point that the plot breaks down and it seems they wanted to just end the script in the alloted time.

Cameo appearances by well-known movie stars of the era are interspersed. If you don't watch carefully you'll miss them however. The most creative part is the conclusion.",1175990400,2,1116,4.807291666666667

They land on a tropical island somewhere in the southern Pacific Ocean. Each one assumes that he will be the one to marry Princess Lalah. And, similar to the characters in Gilligan's Island, they have to deal with such things as wild beasts (in this case, the affections of a gorilla), natives and their poison darts, an angry volcano, and the imminent prospect of being beheaded. So who actually gets to marry Princess Lalah? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.",1168905600,5,679,4.904347826086957
1093745,4,6305914818,"The ROAD TO BALI was technically the last of Hope and Crosby's Paramount Road movies.  Though THE ROAD TO HONG KONG followed almost ten years later, ROAD TO BALI is the last film to capture the chemistry between Hope and Crosby.

In the early 1950s, Bob Hope was a very bankable Hollywood star.  His successful color motion pictures, such as THE PALEFACE and SON OF PALEFACE, led to his reteaming with Bing Crosby for another Road picture.  The Road movies reached their peak with ROAD TO MOROCCO, though ROAD TO UTOPIA was also a lot of fun.  The boys reteamed for ROAD TO RIO, but the story became lost in what clearly could have been a movie scripted for Bob Hope alone.

In BALI we once again we find Hope and Crosby trying to make ends meet by remote vaudeville appearances.  Both escape an Australian shotgun wedding and find themselves employed as part of a deep sea diving crew for a wealthy group of Indonesians.  Along the way they meet Dorothy Lamour and escape from the bad guys in typical Hope and Crosby fashion.

ROAD TO BALI is unique in that it was the only Road picture to be photographed in color.  By 1952, Bob Hope movies were chock full of special effects.  This carried over into ROAD TO BALI complete with jungles, aquatic leviathans, magic acts, and volcanic eruptions.  Crosby had a much stronger role in BALI than he did in RIO, but you can easily imagine Bob Hope and Jane Russell filling the lead roles in another PALEFACE sequel.  In fact, the final scene of the movie -- complete with cameo appearance by Jane Russell -- is a direct reference to SON OF PALEFACE.

BALI's storyline is a little weak, but you don't watch a Hope and Crosby movie for Shakespeare.  There are several cameo appearances in this film.  Also look for Leon Askin, who 13 years later would play General Burkhalter in the television series HOGAN'S HEROES.

There are numerous outlets issuing legitimate copies of the ROAD TO BALI.  That is why there are several different listings -- and different DVD covers -- for the DVD.  The DVD copy is very affordable and the quality is good.  In a previous VHS version of this movie, the sound was awful and sounded as if the soundtrack was played through an aluminum can.  The DVD release is an improvement.  Still, the picture could have been sharper.  When compared to the crisp black and white re-release of ROAD TO MOROCCO, ROAD TO BALI is lacking digital restoration.  The image is intact, but the picture could be sharper and color more vivid.  Paramount or Universal (Universal re-released the earlier Road pictures) need to regain control of the rights to BALI and complete some digital remastering.

However, until the film is completely remastered, this DVD is a good substitute.",1118188800,2,2734,4.679245283018868
1093746,5,6305914818,"This road picture is filled with a lot of laughs, and the boys are back in good form.  The previous road picture, ""The Road To Rio"" was terrible (for some reason), but this one sees Bing and Bob having fun again.

The boys are older here (about 51) and it is more obvious with Bing.  And, for the first time, Bob seems to have the upper hand (in that competition of theirs) as he throws some pretty good zingers at Bing.

The pace of this road picture is pretty good ... and things really get rolling once they (Bob, Bing, and Dottie) are on the boat, ready to send Bob down into the water.  The funny lines come one after another (and the quality is pretty high), and it doesn't stop ... until they are captured by the natives ... and then it gets pretty dull, but that is near the end anyway.

My rating list of all seven road pictures goes like this:

1. Utopia

2. Zanzibar

3. Bali

4. Singapore

5. Morocco

6. Hong Kong

7. Rio

1093747,4,6305914818,"The technical aspects of this review refers to the PMB version.

Hope, Crosby and Lamour. Do I need to say more? Probably not. It's another of their ""Road"" pictures and the ONLY one to be filmed in color. It's lots of fun. It's got some good cameos by other stars of the day. It's got the corny jokes and sight gags. It's got songs by all three leads. It's got dances including a water dance by Dorothy Lamour that is um, well provocative for the day. It's not the best ""Road"" picture (Morrocco is still tops), but definitely a pleasant way to spend 90 minutes. If you're a fan of the stars or of this era of pictures, you can't go wrong. Especially with this edition of the film.

You can buy products of PMB at a national retail chain where everything is only a dollar, or you can purchase it here at good ol' Ammy. Why so inexpensive? This Paramount film has fallen into the public domain where anyone (even YOU!) can legally make copies and distribute this film. Print of this Technicolor film is actually quite good. Of course this is nothing from the vault, but it's glitch free. Splices and visual impurities are practically non-existent which is very good. An excellent buy for the money.",1100995200,2,1196,4.481651376146789
1093748,3,6305914818,I really love Bob Hope but this was not one of his best.  Funny yes but look at the younger Hope movies and you will agree that he has better timeing and hummor in the thirties and fourties.  I loved son of Pale face not a road move but a real funny one and lemon drop kid also.  I'm not convinced that just because this movie was in color that it appeals to a younger crowd.  My kids liked the BW ones much better.,1083801600,,415,3.9047619047619047
1093749,3,6305914818,"Bali was a good thematic backdrop for the first color Road movie, and there are a number of special effects to enjoy (actually one of 'em is kind of creepy, but everyone was laughing between the gasps and groans).
If you think you're going to see anything in this film about another actual culture, you're mistaken.  Like all the Roads, this one gives a bizarre Hollywood version of some exotic destination or two.  From Edith Head's oulandish costumes to Australians talking like Kansas farmers, Road to Bali is no National Geographic special.
Lamour gets to sing a cute song twice, (and she is shown singing and swimming in one memorable scene) but otherwise her role seems shorter than ever, which is kind of a shame.  But there are many other pretty girls to ogle at, and some wacked-out dance numbers.  Actually, it has all the ingredients of a cult hit!  (So, actually, if you like weird movies, this is the best Road movie to include in your collection).
Not the best comedic writing of the Road movies, but still full of nuttiness & fun.  Plenty of laughs over dumb gags, wiseacre bantering, and dimwit jokes. Good physical comedy, mugging at camera, silliness. Definitely displays American culture most of all!!",1064448000,3,1220,4.813397129186603
1093750,4,6305914818,"What a delightful Road DVD. Although the only extra is a Bio on Bob Hope, overall it is well worth the money. The color is great and the sound is acceptable(only ocassional fluctuation in level). The sets and costumes really add to this movie. Undoubtly they made them more colorful since this was the only road movie made in color. What a pity. This certainly follows the tradition of the others and Hope, Crosby, and Lamour look great. From stage performers to deep sea divers they sing and dance their way into your heart. If you only buy one road movie then be sure it is this one since it is great and the color will appeal to a younger audience as well. A movie that the whole family will find amusing jokes or site gags.",1060041600,4,727,4.352941176470588
1093751,4,6305914818,"It's a shame that we don't get to see much of Bob Hope's earlier movies on free TV or cable, because they're 99% of the reason the man is so venerated today! For some reason, after 1963, Hope couldn't make a genuinely funny movie to save his life. I guess he just wasn't hungry anymore. The first REAL dog was ""I'll Take Sweden"", a travesty he did with Frankie Avalon and Tuesday Weld. The wisecracking machine had wound down, and the jokes were lame, but here, in one of his legendary ""Road"" movies with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour, he was in full fetter, tossing them off like M-80s along with Crosby, who still manages to surprise me with how adept HE is with one-liners in these movies.

The plot involves H & C playing two vaudevillians in Melbourne, Australia who have both proposed to the same girl, hence starting a chase that has them hopping a train to nowhere, where they find jobs as deep sea divers that take them to the south seas where they meet Lamour through her villainous cousin who hires them. The usual rivalry for her affections ensues and then a whole farce involving treasure, forced marriage and animals develops. There are guest appearances by Humphrey Bogart and Martin and Lewis in this little gem, along with Jane Russell and it's all done to a comic turn. Hope is in great form here and the production itself pretty much follows his lead. The in jokes, like they do in MOST of Hope's better movies, never stop!

During this period, (the late forties and early fifties,) Paramount and Columbia were THE houses for comedies and farces, and the series of Bob Hope movies were definitely among Paramount's best!

You can't go wrong getting this gem along with the other ""Road"" and pre-""Call Me Bwana"" Bob Hope movies...
