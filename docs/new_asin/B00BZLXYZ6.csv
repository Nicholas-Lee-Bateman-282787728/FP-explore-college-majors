8575870,5,B00BZLXYZ6,"Excellent! Here ""Diva"" Diana is truly ""divina!""  Diana Damrau is a most charming and expressive performer with a talent for transmitting her feelings to fit the mood of the program.  The accompanying documentary gives additional insight into this versatile perfortmer--with a knack for making every note count--as well as a pleasure to listen to!  Her also gifted accompanist, Xavier De Maistre, creates the perfect harmony and just the right mood for the mostly French art songs repertoire. An excellent choice as a holiday gift for the hard to please music lover.  A delight to spend a cozy fireside evening with that special person of similar taste!",1416355200,,652,5.122641509433962
8575871,3,B00BZLXYZ6,"The Documentary is great.
The singing in the Concert is great. Hpwever I would have loved subtitles for the songs. Sadly, I need them. I also miss the piano accompaniments for the songs that I recognize. It is unclear as to whether or not there are subtitles in the literature.",1402444800,2,277,4.56
8575872,4,B00BZLXYZ6,Splendid singing; magnificent harp-playing. Bujt why no subtitles? Why? Why ?Why? Biographical snippets from La Damrau's life was a welcome bonus. Thank you. But let me reiterate: Why no subtitles? Why?,1388361600,2,202,5.548387096774194
8575873,5,B00BZLXYZ6,"This Baden Baden vocal recital by Diana Damrau and harpist Xavier de Maistre easily fits into the 'best vocal recital DVD' category for the past five years. Filmed in Baden Baden's concert hall in 2010, Damrau sung four groups of songs - Debussy, Faure, Schumann and Richard Strauss. Gounod's 'Ave Maria' was an encore piece.
Damrau has for years been a top-notch lied singer on top of being a truly first class coloratura operatic soprano.  The four groups of songs come in two French and two German.  While you may argue that Damrau's first call is German lieder, her French is also first class, and she interprets the Debussy and Faure pieces with no less stylistic glamour and tonal beauty than her Strauss and Schumann.
At the harp, star harpist Xavier de Maistre has an added 'bonus' of a sharp stage presence, great musical intelligence and first-rate technique.  The harp is a particularly apt instrument for accompanying the songs by Debussy and Faure; the two Claire de lune pieces included.
Damrau does not merely 'sing' the pieces; she interprets them with full emotional commitment and gives meaning to every word she sings. Each song is invested with individual drama, however short may the duration be.  It is hard to find such high level of lied interpretive skills in a singer so young (she wasn't 40 when this recital was given).
The rest of the DVD is devoted to a documentary on Damrau's operatic career, with the soprano dubbing her earlier German introductions in English.  I am extremely happy that Virgin Classics saw it fit to include this wonderful documentary 'Diva Divina' into this recital DVD with English introductions by Damrau herself.
This documentary gives a sufficiently good footage of Damrau's vocal developments since 12 years old; her musical choices; her teachers' feedbacks; her role spans and her own private life. There are several excertps from Damrau's operatic performances that are truly exemplary - the 'Barbiere di Sivigli' at MET, the 'Don Givoanni' at Geneva, to name but two that are not already available on DVD (the Salzburg 'Die Zauberflote' is available).
For Damrau fans a must see and for vocal aficionados, not to be missed.",1371168000,6,2184,4.972602739726027
