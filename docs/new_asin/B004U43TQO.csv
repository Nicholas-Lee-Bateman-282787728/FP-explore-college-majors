8441177,4,B004U43TQO,"This movie gives the important message that nothing is achieved by violence. India and Pakistan will only be able to be friends by, well, being friendly to each other. In the name of religion, terrorists invade India and spread bloodshed in Kashmir, both POK and Indian, killing innocent civilians, leaving no room for love. The ending is very poetic and conveys this message beautifully. However, although this message is conveyed, there still is that disgusting Gadar-style Pakistan bashing in the first half. If the theme of the movie is to spread love, then why do is it rip on Pakistan? I have a feeling those dialogues were added in to ""commercialize"" the film. The ending makes up for it, though.
love the movie it was not like other love stories it was good and it got me crying at the end the acting was good and the plot was just cliff hanging it the best be movie I have seen it is my no. 1 movie. Having the girls dad have to kill was just heart breaking. But when the evil person gets killed at the end showed how the dad felt. It sent out the message of love and peace and the ending was just beautiful with the lovers singing at the end and the countries stop fighting and learnt to love. I hope the 2 main actors will do another movie together and make lots more films. the way they both dyed was just horrific but they were married and were happy that they could be together even if they had to die. The moral of this story was very good and hope i will be seeing more of the two new-coming actors.",1305763200,,1515,4.319298245614035
