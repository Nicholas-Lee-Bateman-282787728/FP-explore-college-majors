5716482,4,B00CDODCIS,"The content cannot be denied, and those who think faith and reason are incompatible must watch this short biography to understand that true philosophy encompasses both -- something the Catholic Church has embraced since Augustine (4th Century) and before...WAAAYYYY before the Protestant Reformation and Renaissance.

The 5th star was withheld due to poor sound quality -- not sure if it was the source video or Amazon; it seems audio post-production was neglected and levels are all over the place.",1409529600,4,499,5.3164556962025316

5716484,5,B00CDODCIS,This is a great story told in a contemporary way. Very enlightening.,1409097600,,68,4.75
5716485,5,B00CDODCIS,"The story of St. Augustine is inspiring and, although it leaves out some important details, such as the death of his son, it's accurate. I like the fact that it explains candidly, why he had to part with the mother of his child. It challenges us to view and respect the customs of his time.",1408579200,,290,4.290909090909091
5716486,5,B00CDODCIS,"If you are interested in the life of St. Augustine then this documentary is a must-SEE for you! I was interested in learning more about this man and this film didn't disappoint me; I learned a great deal. Overall, this is a great man of faith who is still a great influence on millions of people around the world. I highly recommend this documentary for all who love history, especially church history.",1405728000,,402,4.597222222222222
5716487,5,B00CDODCIS,"Have you ever wanted to talk about St. Augustine and discuss his works, but felt daunted at the prospects, by merely looking at his two most famous volumes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Confessions/dp/0375700218/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Confessions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-of-God-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140448942/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City of God (Penguin Classics)</a>? Be rest assured.... this little DVD is  perfect for you!
Hosted by Mike Aquilina, an expert on patristic studies(on the early Church Fathers) and shot on location in Rome and Milan(most probably in the places frequented by St. Augustine), Mr. Aquilina leaves no stone unturned in dealing with the life of St. Augustine, with a dexterity that keeps the viewer interested and entertained while imparting a wealth of knowledge.

We journey with Augustine from his youth, to his life as a student, rhetorician and finally as bishop of Hippo. The emotions that he felt, his thoughts as well as the life he led is well presented in a manner that would edify anyone, especially since passages from his works, particularly the 'Confessions' makes it seem that St. Augustine himself is talking to us!
That, in my humble opinion, is important, for it makes this character of great extremes more approachable and believable (not merely a one dimensional figure).
And how can we leave St. Monica out of this whole equation? We can't! It would be like having apple pie....well....without the apples! Without St. Monica whom by her prayers,obtained for her son from our Lord the grace of conversion, we would have no St. Augustine. She has an extremely prominent part in this program.

As we approach the season of Lent (2014), and if we are seeking conversion and to walk the straight and narrow, this DVD would be a great instrument to make that start. For in the life of St. Augustine, anyone can take courage and garner much hope, in the way God can transform a great sinner into a great Saint and even a doctor of His Church.
Truly his life remains a lesson for all generations and ages!

And you fathers and mothers out there, who seem to constantly worry about the lives your children live, this show is for you as well, for in St, Monica you will find much needed encouragement and inspiration!

This program is 55 minutes long in English or Spanish with subtitles in either/both languages.

5716488,2,B00CDODCIS,It was interesting but the sound quality was not very good,1463529600,,58,4.363636363636363
5716489,3,B00CDODCIS,Saint Augustine is in fact worthy of the title saint and with that in mind I believe he is worthy of a better quality documentary.  The voiceover that does his voice is an Englishman... Mr. Augustine was not English.  The story of his life is shown by drawn illustrations that were clearly made by someone who works part time at Disney Studios Animation Department.  In other words the documentary was good for a low budget production but could have been better.,1461628800,,462,4.679012345679013

5716493,4,B00CDODCIS,"Very informative show on probably the most towering figure in historical Christianity. Format of the show is very dry with no fluff, but that is just fine for those who are truly interested in the life of St. Augustine.",1458000000,,219,4.641025641025641
5716494,5,B00CDODCIS,"This a great book, it's s must read for any Christian or non-Christian. It's a great insight into Saint Augustine's life as he confesses from birth to his death his sins. I resonated completely with his youthful life. It made me think s little deeper of my life and the fact that we are in desperate need of a Savior",1457308800,,316,4.283333333333333

5716497,4,B00CDODCIS,The documentary is very good but the video and visual effects seem a little to basic. Great information regarding this amazing Saint.,1448064000,,133,5.090909090909091

Minor issues with the editing of the movie. Just overlook that aspect",1439769600,,202,4.771428571428571

5716512,5,B00CDODCIS,"Excellent, well paced documentary about the life of Augustine that is not too stale. There's obviously more they could have put in the documentary, but, I think they pieced it together nicely without boring the viewer or going too long. Well done.",1424390400,,247,4.904761904761905
5716513,5,B00CDODCIS,Very informative. This was my first introduction to St Augustine. Happy that I took the time to view this.,1422230400,,106,4.631578947368421

5716522,5,B00CDODCIS,"In today's overstimulated world, teens and most adults are more likely to learn by video rather that written material.  This presentation of St. Augustine's life and conversion, narrated by Mike Aquilina, should be on every high school religion teacher's repertoire. It should also be viewed by every parent, to help them understand their teens! Every parish should show Mike's presentation to their RCIA groups and their parishioners.  Mike is well known as an expert on the Church Fathers, so he is the perfect story teller for the saint who had such a lasting impact on the Catholic Church.  I feel that I have a more complete knowledge of who St. Augustine was.  Too often the only thing people about Augustine is that he was a playboy in his youth and then he converted.  We cheat ourselves when we don't learn more about the saints of the Church beyond the ""sound bite"" stories.  I am happy that I discovered this DVD.",1414108800,3,924,4.74375
5716523,2,B00CDODCIS,Was a tedious watch and not that informative!  Sure there is something better out there on this subject!,1413072000,,104,4.777777777777778
5716524,5,B00CDODCIS,Saint Augustine is a saint all of us can relate to. He is proof that you don't need to be perfect to become a saint. It was a very informative video. It gave me enough information to read up on St. Augustine in more detail.,1412899200,2,223,3.977777777777778
5716525,4,B00CDODCIS,Enjoyed this review of St. Augustine's Life.  Events brought forth that I had forgotten.  I remember this story being an inspiration earlier in my life.,1412121600,,152,5.04
5716526,3,B00CDODCIS,"Excellent content about Augustine, though the presentation was
so-so.",1411776000,,69,6.777777777777778
5716527,5,B00CDODCIS,"We need more videos like this, that teach about the early Church saints and their contribution to spreading Christianity.  Many have no idea of the history and Tradition of Christianity and that the fullness of the Christian faith can only be found in the Catholic Church.
Thank you for making this available on Amazon Prime!  And thanks to Mike Aquilina and Robert Fernandez for making the video.",1411689600,6,397,4.91044776119403
8580523,3,B00CDODCIS,"Like other people are saying, the content is very interesting, but the audio levels are terrible: when Mike Aquilina (the host) talks, the audio is too low. But when you turn the volume up, then the narrator is way too loud.
I don't know if this is Amazon's fault or if it's an issue with the original video.",1497139200,,308,4.327586206896552
8580524,4,B00CDODCIS,"The movie exhibited excellent insights into Augustine, and how he interacted with key people in his time.  There was a problem with the productions control of sound level.  Some sections were much too soft, others were too loud.  This should have been fixed in the sound editing of the film.",1486166400,2,291,4.78
8580525,5,B00CDODCIS,Very well made. It's an older movie but it kept me very interested from start to finish.,1485820800,,88,4.235294117647059
8580526,3,B00CDODCIS,"It's always interesting to learn from Saint Augustine's life story. thank you for that.
But the quality of this documentary is not that.  The painting was not suitable. I do not know what was the reason for Silences And interrupting the music and narration.",1485302400,,257,4.840909090909091
8580527,5,B00CDODCIS,Got to know this Church Father much better thanks to this video. Thank you!,1484784000,,75,4.428571428571429

8580530,3,B00CDODCIS,"This gets 5 stars for content. It was really interesting. The 3 stars are because of the sound quality. The sound level is uneven, and I had to keep adjusting the volume on my computer, up and down, depending on the segment. It detracted from the overall viewing experience.",1477267200,,274,4.612244897959184
8580531,5,B00CDODCIS,"The information presented in this video provides a very good outline of his life and some reference to his major works.  If you want to know about the man, this is a great video for that.  If you are more interested in his theology, the video does not cover this area very well.",1475107200,,278,4.226415094339623
8580532,5,B00CDODCIS,This is a quality film the demonstrate the human condition and how we are bound to conscience and the quest for knowledge of God.  The audio volume shifts between the narrator and the expert.,1473292800,,191,4.617647058823529
