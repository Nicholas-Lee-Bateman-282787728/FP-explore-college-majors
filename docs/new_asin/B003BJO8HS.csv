I was shocked to see the price of this ""complete"" set and while I enjoyed the series, there is no way on this earth that I would pay almost a thousand dollars for two and a half seasons of any series. Amazon should take a look at this and the two reviews to see if they are legit.",1395878400,,394,3.876543209876543
8393672,5,B003BJO8HS,"This use to be a T.V. series and it was really a good show.
It was a true story which made it so much worth watching.
There was a lot of people upset when the  show was dropped by the network.

I am so glad I found this.  So,  looked forward to watch it every week now I can whenever I like.",1373068800,,291,3.6451612903225805
