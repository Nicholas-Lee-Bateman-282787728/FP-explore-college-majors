6244986,4,B00I099JYQ,My only problem with this purchase is that the four discs are stacked on on top the other and when I tried to take the top disc off to watch it the disc cracked in half. So the way the manufacturers packaged these is awful. I cannot watch the first 11 episodes now since the disc is ruined. I won't buy anymore of these. I've loved this show since childhood but I won't rick wasting my money and possibly breaking another disc due to the poor packaging.,1410393600,2,453,4.218390804597701
6244987,5,B00I099JYQ,"I've been a Bundy fan since it was actually on TV (although, in my opinion the show became very poor after about season 5, and especially after season 6).  I videotaped all the shows from seasons 1 - 4 and my wife and I watched the tapes over and over again.  We thought it was great when the series was finally released on DVD, and now we own seasons 1 - 6, plus season 8 (because of ""The D'Arcy Files,"" ""The Worst Noel,"" and ""How Green Was My Apple"").  It's always annoyed us that Sony replaced Sinatra's ""Love and Marriage"" with generic instrumental crap, as well as giving us edited versions of episodes like Jim Jupiter and 2-part xmas.  So now, we finally have unedited seasons 3 and 4 with Frank's song.  I can't see anything ""out of sync"" with the opening song (no disrespect intended to the viewer who could), it seems to begin and end as it should.  And I thought the picture was fine.  So, for me, this is absolutely wonderful -- the real Bundys, uncut, with the real song.",1406678400,2,984,4.344262295081967

6244989,4,B00I099JYQ,"As a long-time fan of Married with Children, I've already purchased all the previous box sets Sony has released over the years of the eleven season run, however, as many know, most of those came with issues. In particular, from season three onward, the iconic theme song ""Love and Marriage"" by Frank Sinatra was replaced by generic instrumental music for budgetary reasons, and certain episodes of season four were presented in heavily edited syndication format. Thankfully, Mill Creek Entertainment has licensed the rights to the show, and are now gradually releasing the seasons fully uncut with original theme song music intact. I was very pleased to see even ""It's a Bundyful Life"" with the lost Bundy snow cone scene intact amongst other classic moments.

All that being said, this particular set is still not great by any means. I think my biggest issue stems from the picture quality, which is really a mixed bag overall. Granted, Married with Children isn't exactly the type of show known for being visually dazzling, like most sitcoms of the era it was shot on video as opposed to film. However, Mill Creek's presentation of the episodes is still rather inconsistent, some episodes look respectable while others appear far too soft or rather questionable in other ways. I'm not sure if the slightly cramped disc format (11 to 12 episodes on each) is to blame for this, but upon comparing the episodes to the Sony versions, Sony was much more consistent and commendable.

If you're a fan of the show and have already purchased seasons three and four from Sony, I would still recommend this set for completest reasons. It is both inexpensive and compact and also provides uncut presentations for all episodes. I would still hold onto the old sets though, as those video presentations are indeed a little bit better.",1401321600,8,1822,4.931596091205212
6244990,5,B00I099JYQ,It was even funnier than I remember!!  I strongly recommend you buy this You will laugh you hinny off for sure,1399593600,,110,4.238095238095238
6244991,3,B00I099JYQ,"Seasons 3 and 4 of Married...With Children were previously released on DVD by Sony. Reviews were mixed. The biggest complaint was the replacement of ""Love and Marriage"" by Frank Sinatra. Instead, it featured a generic theme song. Things got worse in season 4. On top of the theme still being gone, the ending credits were altered (in this case, re-created) to remove ""Love and Marriage"" from the credits. This didn't become too much of an issue in season 4, since they featured a static image throughout. However, an even bigger issue crept in. A total of 8 episodes were edited, using syndication prints instead of the original network versions.

When the news of Mill Creek re-releasing Married...With Children was first announced, I was a little skeptical. I figured it would just be a simple re-release of the Sony DVDs. Then it was announced that ""Love and Marriage"" would be intact on seasons 3 and 4, and suddenly, I was thrilled. I became even more excited when it was announced that all episodes would be uncut.

Now that the set is out, the question must be asked: Is this the definitive version to buy?

Definitive compared to the Sony sets? Yeah, sure. In general? Not so much.

Yes, ""Love and Marriage"" is intact, and that is a good thing. However, it seems like it was more of a dub job than actually using the original masters. It's very noticeable in the first episode on season 3, when the music is out of sync during the intro. Things do get better in the rest of season 3, and as such, I'm satisfied overall in that regard. The credits music seems to be of little issue, at least, even using the right edit for ""I'm Goin' To Sweatland"". Then we get to season 4, and things take a step backward. It seems like the theme song was taken from seasons 1-3. But you're probably asking, ""Wasn't 'Love and Marriage' used throughout the series?"" Yes, it was, however, the sound that plays when the show's logo appears on screen plays at a different point during the seasons 4-10 intros. So, as a result, it becomes completely off-sync when the wrong intro edit is used. Season 4 further proves that this was a dub job and nothing more. The credits still remain altered, which really doesn't bode well for seasons 5-10, at least, where some episodes have something happening during the credits. On the Sony DVDs, those credits feature a still image instead.

The good news, at least, is that the 8 episodes that were edited on Sony's season 4 set are now uncut here. Even though It's A Bundyful Life still appears as 2 parts instead of 1, Part 2 is a whomping 25:32, which definitely means nothing is missing here. All episodes are slightly over 23 minutes long.

Mill Creek's DVD re-release also uses less discs compared to the Sony sets (2 discs instead of 3 per season), and while it may seem questionable to stuff 11-12 episodes in one disc, the quality surprisingly holds up decently. Compression artifacts do creep up from time to time, but it's never really bad, and the episodes still appear better than watching them in reruns. Sound quality is good, on-par with Sony's DVDs.

Overall, I do give the edge to Mill Creek's re-release. It's not perfect, but with ""Love and Marriage"" intact (somewhat), all episodes uncut, and a great price point, it's still worth it. I do hope these issues can be resolved in the future re-releases. My score of 3 stars out of 5 balances out the pros and cons of the set, IMO.",1397692800,28,3425,4.614121510673235
