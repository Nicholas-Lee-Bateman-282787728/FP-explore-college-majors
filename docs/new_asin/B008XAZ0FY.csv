Sorority Girls and the Creature From Hell (1990) **1/2 / 4
D: John McBrearty
C: Len Lesser, Deborah Dutch, Eric Clark, Carl Johnson
P: A group of sorority girls staying in a remote cabin are killed off by one girl's uncle, who has been turned into a carnivorous monster by a vengeful Indian spirit.

One of the biggest trends, of late, in the horror genre is to try and recreate a bygone era. A homage or throwback if you will. The problem with most of these throwbacks is that they feel forced, as though everyone is trying too hard.

Whether by accident or intentionally, Sorority Girls and the Creature From Hell feels like an effortless throwback to the monster movies of the 50's & 60's, only it has been spiced up with some modern day violence and plenty of gratuitous nudity. In one very funny scene, a female character stands around naked, drying herself off with a towel for what seems like an endless amount of time. One of the characters comments as to whether or not she is going to eventually put on some clothes.

Production values are low....low.....low. The acting is cheesey. The score is perfectly overwrought. The special effects & sets look perfectly cheap. The film's antagonists, a creature from hell and the stone creature that controls it, are fun. And with a title like Sorority Girls and the Creature From Hell, it would fit perfectly alongside the titles of the 50's & 60's.

Earlier in my review I commented about whether the film was a homage by intention, but with a title like Sorority Girls and the Creature From Hell, I think the intent is rather clear. Back in the late 80's / early 90's, throwbacks weren't in style. In fact, the only one I can think of off the top of my head is Not of this Earth (also doubling as a remake), which starred Traci Lords. As a result, most people took this film far too seriously. For those that get it though, this is entertaining stuff. [Not Rated] 86 mins.",1388534400,,2024,4.580110497237569
