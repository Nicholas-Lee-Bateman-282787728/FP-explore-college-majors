1350240,5,B00004TCN6,"The tape addressed issues that no one has ever tried to address with me during swim lessons.  I've tried for over 30 years to learn to swim but have never lost my fear of the water.  I actually tried to float on my back in the shallow end (1-1/2 feet) of the pool on our vacation.  I've NEVER floated on my back before but I did after watching this tape.  I still have a long way to go - practicing what was mentioned on the tape.  I found it very inspiring, like a light bulb finally turned on.",1120867200,8,495,4.010204081632653
1350241,4,B00004TCN6,"What I particularly liked in the video:
-the description of the levels of fear:  very clear
-the examples of students going out of their body and then back in: really helped me understand what the goal was
-the description of how people float (not necessarily horizontal): this allowed me to just be natural in the water rather than trying to use other's techniques
-Melon's direction""like laying down on a pillow"":  before, I did not know how to get into the back float position
Before video:
I was comfortable floating on my front in the shallow end of the pool.  I was terrified of floating on my back, even with my husband standing next to me with his hands under me.  When on my back, I would become dizzy and found the listing sensation terrifying.
After video:
I started floating on my back by the stairs, holding on with my hands.  Within a few minutes I was able to let go and float on my back without panicking.  I was then able to move away from the stairs and float on my back.  It was so relaxing and enjoyable, I did not want to stop!",1087776000,4,1048,4.371134020618556
1350242,5,B00004TCN6,"Wooooo Huuuuuuu!
I finally got it after practising the floating for a few weeks!
Now I can swim over the deep water of the swimming pool with no fear, even though I can breast stroke for only 20 feet.
I have been trying to learn swimming since I was 20. After 13 years, I succeeded thanks to this miracle video. Now I need to improve the mechanics to swim further :-) ......",1075420800,11,374,4.208333333333333
1350243,5,B00004TCN6,"I bought Melon's video and felt that she had found the missing thing that swimming instructors aren't able to provide, and that is that we need to stay in the present, and not think about the skill we are learning. Usually, if we are thinking about anything it is how terrified we are of the water, and how out of control we feel in it. Melon's theory is to stay present and feel how the water is affecting our bodies in it.  Our staying present, relaxes us and we can then find that we will learn how to be in control of ourselves in it.  This is how we overcome our fears of water.",1047254400,6,583,4.105263157894737
1350244,1,B00004TCN6,"This video does not go beyond common sense, and for such a hefty price.  I was extremely disappointed with it.  I even gave it to a woman who was afraid to put her head under water, having had a bad experience on water. Even her assessment was the same--the video offered nothing she did not already know.",1045785600,2,305,4.333333333333333
1350245,5,B00004TCN6,"got my video on aug 12 i find the video vary infomative i would
like to try some of the methods in the video in my upcoming swimming lessons i think malon takes great intrest in her students she pays attendtion to what the student is doing. and she stays in her game zone if a emergency does occur she would be
right there i hope that my teacher will be like her thanks i am looking forward to more videos or maybe a book",1029369600,2,421,3.9647058823529413
1350246,5,B00004TCN6,"""I watched the video 2 times. Then, I went to the pool to attend my private
swimming lesson. This was my 7th session in the pool, I have a very good
instructor. However,after I watched your video I realized that most of the times I was ""pushing myself"" - so ""I was not there"". This time I tried to ""be there"" - tried to act in a conscious way and this made a great difference, my coach could not believe the progress I made.
Also I should say that you taught me a great way in practicing to float or be in water. I used the stairs of the pool to stay in deep water, to float within deep water as you show in the video. This helped me a lot.
I want to thank you for both instructing me and for your support from such a long distance. This means a lot to me.",1017792000,10,756,3.8838709677419354
1350247,5,B00004TCN6,"If I could give advice to someone who really has a deep desire to learn to swim, I would tell them to first watch your video.......watch it several times.  Then, get in the water and attempt to do the simplest of things the video teaches, such as putting your face in the water.  It may seem too elementary to the average non-swimmer to be of any value, but it's not.  It's extremely important as your video demonstrates.  Actually, the one woman in the video who was deathly afraid of deep water was quite an inspiration to me.
After four swim lessons at the Y I knew that I would never learn how to swim if I used their methods.  They were not addressing my fear of water.  In my frustration, I got on the Internet and discovered the Transpersonal Swimming Institute's web page.  Hooray!  There it was, an answer to my prayers.
After watching your video, I found that I actually liked the feeling of the water holding me up.  It felt relaxing.  Your video demonstrates that people float at different levels.  My instructor at the Y had taught us that floating perfectly horizontally was the only correct way.  Floating at my natural level enabled me to relax in the water for the first time.  Plus, it's reassuring knowing that my body's fat content is somewhat average!
What I achieved after watching the video twice is just short of miraculous.  In two weeks I went from being a non-swimmer to a floater to an actual swimmer.  The video gave me information on how to conquer my fear of water but also provided me with the confidence to try.
I think most non-swimmers believe that nearly everyone else in the world knows how to swim except for them.  I certainly did.  Knowing how to swim contributes to a sense of normalcy, self-assurance and self-reliance.  For anyone that loves being in water (and I always have), knowing how to swim adds a dimension to life that seems unattainable for non-swimmers.
Thank you again. Sharry",1017100800,26,1931,4.5964912280701755

7922458,5,B00004TCN6,Who knew that reading a book and watching a video would help me overcome my fear of water?!  She's a genius!,1379894400,,108,4.142857142857143
7922459,3,B00004TCN6,This DVD was just what I needed to improve my confidence in shallow water.  However I was disappointed that there was no real support for the move into deep water.  One minute people were floating etc in shallow water and then all of a sudden almost all of them were jumping in the deep end.  The DVD stopped short of what I really needed - guidance and tactics to improve my confidence in deep water - especially when the unexpected happens nearby.,1362787200,2,449,4.451219512195122
7922460,3,B00004TCN6,"I enjoyed watching this DVD very much! Mellon Dash has a great mental approach to teaching someone to get comfortable with water. She tells students to stay in their comfort zone. So students are not afraid and don't freak out since they never go past their comfort zone.

In the DVD you learn to get comfortable submerging yourself underwater. You also learn how to find your natural float. Some people float with most of their body on top of the water, some people float with the majority of their body under water and others cannot float at all.

Mellon says that regardless of how you float or do not float, it is okay.

Unfortunately, I am a non-floater, so the only benefit I gained from the DVD is to learn to be more comfortable in the water. This is still a good thing though and I recommend the video to anyone that is scared of being in the water.

People that are not fearful of water will not gain anything from this video. People that are afraid can learn how to submerge themselves at their own pace and also possibly how to front float and back float. That will depened on your body structure/makeup.

I wish Mellon had a school in my State. I would sign up as soon as possible.",1348704000,3,1194,4.384615384615385
7922461,2,B00004TCN6,"I couldn't agree more with the others who rated this video poorly. But, I'll admit that I have been reading her book prior to the viewing, and already was exposed to her ideas in print. I'd say that the video was more about self-promotion than actually helping someone with fear of water. The length was definitely too short and lacked significant content. Not worth the price. I'd say it was worth about 10 bucks because the only thing that I found worthwhile was the idea of staying within oneself, realizing your fears, and understanding that everyone has the potential to be a swimmer (actually, I already had got that from the book). Like the others, I couldn't believe that there wasn't more indepth content. Much of the video consisted of listening to the student's beliefs and fears about water and watching them stick their face in it. Big deal. And my girlfriend bought this for me as a Christmas gift. Now I'll have to pretend just how informative and helpful it was. However, I'm getting more out of her book ""Conquer Your Fear of Water""... at least thus far. Personally, I don't understand the glowing reviews. Here's basically what you'll learn: don't inhale while under water, don't do anything you're not comfortable with, progress at your own pace, you can float (but not all people float the same way), the deep water will hold you up, and don't allow your mind to leave your body. There, I've just saved you a fistful of dollars because that's all there is. You can send me half the money for saving you the rest. Just kidding. Really people, don't waste your money. Better yet, try getting the book from the library or buying a used version from Amazon. I'll comment on the overall quality of the book when I'm done with it.",1262822400,20,1744,4.647249190938512
7922462,1,B00004TCN6,"I feel I missed something in addition to fifty dollars.  I am a new swimmer with fears of the deep end.  While the instructor's guidance on staying in your body is good and well taken, the rest of the video does nothing for someone who needs to overcome a fear of deep water.  Had I been aware of the lack of content in this product I never would have spent the money.  When it was over I could not believe it!  I literally just stared at my computer screen in disbelief.  What a pity.  Wish I had my $$$ back.  Oh well.",1131580800,7,520,4.029411764705882
