8734282,5,B015Q33J08,"A sublimely moving account of the Holy Family! Unfortunately, it has been poorly edited removing scenes that make  the storyline in some places difficult for someone who hasn't seen the full length film to follow. Too bad the entire film can't be released. I would buy it in a flash and pay more.  A beautiful film to watch, especially at Christmas.",1479686400,,349,4.704918032786885

8734285,5,B015Q33J08,"The story of Jesus will always rate five stars no matter how you slice the cake.  However, they totally cut so many parts out of the original version that the story line was very hard to follow.  Was it because they couldn't fit the original version on these CD's?  If so, why would they do that? I would have even paid more for the original.  I am so upset at this as I have waited so long for this to come out.  How dare they cut up this incredibly beautiful movie!",1449619200,4,467,4.087912087912088
