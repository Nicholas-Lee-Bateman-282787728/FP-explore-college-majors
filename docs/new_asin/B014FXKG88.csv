7391139,5,B014FXKG88,"I love these movies.. after reading the books at least 20 years ago. At first I didn,t care much for Heather Grahm being the mother.. thought she was too young to play the part. But after watching a couple times.. she does very well. And the original movie Flowers in the attic.. I didn't care much for the Grandmother.. because Louise Fletcher was perfect in the original movie. But the more I watch the new one.. this Grandmother plays a great role.",1519948800,,451,4.512195121951219

7391162,4,B014FXKG88,"Watched the series on Lifetime, all 4 movies in a row. Great movies and glad to see them all in one DVD collection and at a great price. Package was delayed by shipper but arrived the next day. The shipping envelope was taped up on one side. Vendor didn't even bother to use a new envelope. The DVD case didn't close on the bottom and the spine seemed to have been bent in because the paper was ripped slightly. When breaking the seal noticed that Seeds of Yesterday had some scratches, hopefully not damaging the DVD to skip. To close case, need to press the bottom right corner and the case will close. Glad to have found this set, now I can get more space on my DVR at home. Will share with my sister who is a big VC Andrew's fan. Overall, happy with the purchase. Maybe not order from this vendor in the future due to the taped envelope and shape of the DVD packaging. The photo shows the taped up side, the rip on top is mine.",1493078400,,931,4.177777777777778

7391166,3,B014FXKG88,"I wanted to love these movies. I have read the books multiple times and love them. I know the books are usually better than the movies, but the way lifetime skips over major plot points and change things is crazy. Especially Petals in the Wind- they totally omitted the Paul and Cathy love story- they really skip over Paul completely and start the movie at his funeral. Which really, happens after Carrie's death but she attends his funeral? The first movie was really good, but the others fall below what I expected. If you haven't read the books you will probably like these movies more, but if you read the books you will be disappointed",1488412800,4,641,4.582608695652174

I thought it was my DVD player so I cleaned it and they still skipped so I cleaned off DVD's and it seemed to help but not really. Skip time increased to about every 30-40 seconds.

That's how addicting this series was! Loved seeing so many familiar faces (actors and actresses) as well! I actually went and bought all the books for the series and it's spin-off too.

DVD case is nice and sturdy. There are two DVD discs. One movie on each side- that is my only complaint. I like to binge watch and having everything on one DVD would make it so much easier.

Great acting and interesting story line. I'm excited to read the books (as the books are always better) and see what missing details I can fill in. Also, this version of Flowers in the Attic is much better than the older version that was made. I watched a few minutes of it on netflix and turned it right off. Heather Graham really does an amazing job!

I have already recommend the series to my best friend as we have the same taste in movies/books. I'm hoping Lifetime will adapt some of the other books in the dollanganger series. I found a book that is set before Flowers in the Attic and then there's the spin-off of Christopher's Diaries.",1454889600,12,1187,4.386363636363637
