2635203,4,B000HEV8QY,"Any release self-deemed an
'independent critical analysis' is more often than not, another name
for 'unauthorized cash-in attempt'. However, this 70-minute bio
offers some historical documentation as well as some well-reasoned
reflections and opinions on this legendary Manchester post-punk act.
Led by the visionary (and troubled) vocalist Ian Curtis, Joy Division
spearheaded a head-on collision between punk, pre-industrial
electronics, and experimental rock. From 1977 to their sudden
implosion in 1980 due to Curtis' untimely suicide, the group released
2 forward-thinking studio LPs as well as numerous singles that
explored everything from love to loss to isolation to loneliness to
jubilation. Some writers who were around to experience the group's
heyday comment here, as well as associates and esteemed music
journalists who respectfully reflect on the group's short but
influential career. A nice career summation, and worth a viewing for
die-hard fans.",1202860800,2,964,5.843971631205674
2635204,3,B000HEV8QY,"This DVD was not as bad as I thought it might be based on the previous two reviews. This is a great starting point for post-punk fans that may not have had much exposure to Joy Division.  Sure they don't interview any band members, nor do they show the live performances in their entirety, but they do chronicle the brief life of the band at a high enough level not to lose the viewer in the mundane details.  Sections of JD history skipped include any mention of the first unreleased RCA album, the Still double LP and the `We Are the Young Men' Ikon video.  One thing they did quite well was the objective comparisons to other artists and bands.  Comparing ""Atmosphere"" to the Ron Spector sound of ""Be My Baby"" and Steven Morris' drumming to that of Can's drummer were startling.  I've always read about these comparisons before but have never played side-by-side comparisons.  There is also a brief mention at a Brian Eno album that points squarely at Joy Division sound-alike.  Here too the brief sound-bite comparison is eerie.  This will provide more for me to investigate, as I do not currently have anything by Eno in my collection.  Also worth mentioning is the full translation of the infamous Ian Curtis pub interview.  Between the heavy Mancunian accent and the background noise, I've never been able to fully decipher Ian.  Here the caption text is provided for you in snippets throughout the DVD and in full as a DVD extra.  There's also a semi-lame Joy Division trivia quiz in the extras section.  In all, I'd recommend this as a gift or purchase for someone who wants to get to know Joy Division, but it is probably too light on information or anything new to those fans who grew up with the band.",1167091200,18,1713,4.595394736842105
2635205,1,B000HEV8QY,"The ""rare musical performances"" amounted to a few seconds Joy Division performing.  The whole dvd kept giving the viewer teaser shots if you will of live performances but never delivered. It never played a song in it's entirety.  The ""rare interviews"" as described were garbled and very hard to understand.  Very disappointing.",1165363200,31,327,5.25

The 1977-80 life of Joy Division has been the centre of much debate! The talents of the Manchester 4 has reached new quarters via such posthumous occurences as:
An incisive BBC documentary that discussed the despair, flare and hedonism of their Factory Record label;
the death of Tony Wilson who gave the band a break on Factory;
a fine Joy Division-Under Review DVD (MVD) that examines a seminal act; the re-runs of key LPs-Unknown Pleasures/Closer/Still (WB) (with alt. bonus live CDs);
the Joy Division: Martin Hannetts personal Mixes CD (Interstate) uniting the nuances of a one off producer;
the Joy Division movie and the Anton Corbijn directed Control biopic of Ian Curtis (whose sad 1980 suicide ended the band).
The LPs enhance studio & stage recordings-& how I rue the day that a 79 Buzzcocks/Joy Division Cardiff gig was cancelled at the 23rd hour.!;
a Control score that gels the influences of Curtis/Morris/Hook/Sumner with their songs + future fayre! An epic 18 tune LP weds Buzzcocks/Bowie/ Iggy/Kraftwerk/Roxy Music/Velvet Underground/Sex Pistols via Joy Division/New Order & on to The Killers!

As the youth salivate over plagiarists/pretenders go to Joy Division for a real rock ride! Please note a list of acts that have covered this band: Nine Inch Nails/LCD Soundsystem/Moby/Grace Jones/Paul Young/Therapy?/Tortoise/Low/Dead Men Walking & Girls against Boys.

NB Read Touching from a Distance by Deborah Curtis & From Joy Division to New Order by Mick Middles plus books by Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner give you a real feel of the situations of yesteryear.
The everlasting endeavour of these these Lancastrian lads is both timeless & priceless!
The original post punk scene mined a rich seam e.g. PIL/Killing Joke/Echo & the Bunnymen/Gang of 4/The Cure/Magazine/Joy Division & the Simon Reynolds text Rip it up & start Again is a bible for this era.
However Under Review is a worthwhile venture in to the workings of a band who had to do it the hard way in the back of a van travelling sound the UK and then further afield in Europe. Along the way there were many adventures, achievements and atrocities but the legacy of this ground breaking group is one that cannot be ignored and Under Review is an essential cog in the the ever revolving wheel of Joy Division assessment.",1461369600,,2330,5.010335917312662

With this review I bid a less-than-fond farewell to reviewing the Under Review DVD series. The premise is alluring  taking a look back at some of the greatest rock artists of the past 50 years  but the reality is that a majority of the footage for these DVDs comes from interviews with music writers, and who wants to watch them talk? Theres a reason why music reviews are written and not videotaped. Joy Divisions music is great, and their story is a fascinating one but when it gets told by people who weren't part of it, theres a major disconnect. The snippets of concert footage is welcome, but they end too soon, and always give way to another snoozefest interview. Fans looking to find out more about the band are better off reading about the band, watching 24 Hour Party People, waiting for the long-rumored biopic to come out, or scouring Youtube for good video clips. Anything but this.",1453420800,,964,4.865853658536586
8139080,1,B000HEV8QY,"Horrible and misinformed. Joy Division weren't well educated and not well read? After hearing that comment, I turned the DVD off. No interviews from anyone who knew what they were talking about, including the author who made the ignorant statement I previously mentioned. Total ripoff and I wish I could get a refund. I'll either sell it to a used DVD shop for the few dollars it's worth, or just throw it in the trash where it belongs. I bought the copy that used the title Falling Up, so don't be fooled if you see the copy using that title.",1436140800,,543,4.44

8139082,5,B000HEV8QY,"Saw some mnixed reviews on this dvd, but took a punt and bought it anyway- i think some of the revieweres here are expecting to see performances and interviews that don't actually exist - as far as i know there is barely any footage around of J Division - an the amount used in this is fair representation of what's out theree. A decent documetary and a nice companion piece to 'Control'. Ignore the dissenters.....",1206921600,,415,4.546666666666667
8139083,2,B000HEV8QY,"Joy Division, in their too brief career, made some very interesting music. Unknown Pleasures & Closer are great records, as is Still. Plus the story of the band and its troubled lead singer is a tragic one. But this kind of ""critical review"" isn't going to bring you any closer to this band. Though this assortment of oddfellows-- authors, music critics, and scenesters-- like to go on, they actually have very little to offer because these are not the kind of guys Joy Division hung out with. Most of what is gong on here is a bunch of journalists just repeating second hand news.

A good documentary w/ actual band members would be interesting, but this Under Review (a notoriously rotten series) like all of the other Under Reviews does not actually talk to surviving band members. So, Under Review is not really anything but a chance for critics to hear themselves talk. A half dozen journalists speak but really three of them do most of the talking. A lot of potentially interesting topics are touched upon: punk, postpunk, the Manchester scene as opposed to the London scene, Factory Records, Tony Wilson, producer Martin Hannett, the bands public image v. private reality, Curtis' infidelity, the evolution of the Joy Division sound, the importance of various singles, Joy Division as a European band (influenced by Lou Reed/David Bowie/Iggy Pop's Berlin phases) that probably wouldn't have succeeded in the US etc... but, unfortunately, these sources are not particularly eloquent nor particularly reliable. Oddly enough Curtis' epilepsy is never mentioned, nor what part his medications may have played in his suicide.

Another huge negative: If you put it all together there's probably less than one minute worth of actual footage of the band culled from their rarely seen tv appearances and interviews. Problem is that they only show maybe three to six seconds of footage from each appearance. But plenty of time is spent with the journalists (and these are the chaps that you really get to know here, not the band).

If you have read an article or two about the band and/or you've seen 24 Hour Party People and/or Control you've already been presented with this material and in much more entertaining fashion.",1206576000,7,2221,4.96505376344086
8139084,4,B000HEV8QY,"The documentary starts out talking about the punk scene happening in the UK at the time and how one particular Sex Pistols gig influenced an entire crowd of people who ended up forming their own bands, many of
which became rather successful. It was at this gig that three gentlemen decided to form a band and called themselves Warsaw. It wasn't long before a name change to Joy Division happened and they were gigging and
recording. The story is told through interviews with various music journalists and one of the co-authors of the Ian Curtis biography. They leave no stone uncovered, delving into everything including Curtis' battle with epilepsy, his extra-marital affair and his depression and eventual suicide. There is video footage, live footage,
interview footage, and TV appearance footage.

They do an extremely good job in educating the viewer about pretty much anything they'd want to know about Joy Division, and even give some in-depth analysis about the records and specific songs on them. I've only
been a casual fan of the band and never did much research into their history and now I don't have to, it has been done for me on this DVD.

The disc runs about 70 minutes long and the time seemed to go by quickly.  If you are a fan of Joy Division and wanted to know more about them (which I did), you'll definitely want to add this to your wish list.",1204416000,,1367,4.6875
8139085,5,B000HEV8QY,"This is the ultimate DVD for Joy Division fans. It covers the entire story of the band in 70 minutes and includes rare performances, obscure footage and live performances of songs like 'Transmission' and 'Atmosphere'.

Joy Division was a huge musical influence on many bands and remains a favorite of many listeners to this very day.",1203033600,,333,4.946428571428571
8139086,4,B000HEV8QY,"No matter how much black metal, power electronics and hardcore flies across my desk and into my ears, the status of my favorite band is a toss up between The Police and Joy Division. The Under Review series are documentaries focusing on a specific band's musical material - often breaking down songs to examine them from lyrics, to structure and rhythm. With past volumes about AC/DC and Rolling Stones, I was really floored when I saw they were doing one on Joy Division. I'm not let down either, as they used live footage I hadn't seen, plus rare interviews with the band. Authors of Joy Division books, as well as personal friends tell the story of the band's beginnings as Warsaw to their demise (due to Curtis' suicide) and transformation into New Order. The extras include an Ian Curtis interview, as well as what they call 'The Hardest Joy Division Quiz Ever'... okay, I agree on that. This is a real must for any fan of the band. Not much video material out there on Joy Division, so this makes up for a bit of that.",1202860800,,1024,4.510752688172043
