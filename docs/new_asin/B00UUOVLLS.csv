7071381,5,B00UUOVLLS,"So glad this finally came out. Bought my copy today. Anyone else having trouble getting subtitles to work? Im at 8:11 in the movie and so far no dialog has been subtitled and ive checked 3 times, they are turned on.",1436054400,2,215,4.2682926829268295
7071382,5,B00UUOVLLS,"A 100% on RottenTomatoes, &  Surrealism of the highest kind. Ever since finding out about this movie long ago, I knew it would be a fine example of good old fashion film making.
After watching this ,after getting it today, I can say I see why it's so loved as a movie of Art.
Criterion Collection, I do love the movies you bring back. Already having a few of your best & stranger films, ""Valerie and Her Week of Wonders"" is an excellent addition to own.
Anyone who understand True Art you really must get this movie.",1435622400,15,516,4.319587628865979
7071383,3,B00UUOVLLS,"Valerie and Her Week of Wonders  is an unusual film about a girl on the verge of womanhood who finds herself confronted by both supernatural creatures and her own burgeoning sensuality. Valerie (Jaroslava Schallerova) lives in a large house with her grandmother. She frolics in the fields, picks wildflowers, swims, and dutifully attends church. Her idyllic world is upset, however, when a thief steals a pair of earrings. Chasing the intruder, Valerie comes upon a horrible, white-faced ghoul inspired by Murnaus Nosferatu. The next day, her jewelry is mysteriously returned, but Valerie soon becomes the centerpiece in a series of fantasies, one stranger than the next, many erotic.

Its tough to categorize this film. The presence of vampires and witchcraft make it a candidate as a horror film, but its far more. Czech director Jaromil Jires uses surrealism to paint assorted dream adventures and takes his time introducing the fantasy elements. We first see Valerie as a content innocent, but soon she becomes a restless individual fascinated by erotic thoughts and images as she comes to terms with her own sexuality. Jires is masterful at portraying Valeries inner turmoil cinematically, each shot methodically composed.

The film is seldom mentioned in discussions of horror films, since it is atypical of the genre. It contains aspects that we identify with horror, but they are treated more as devices to awaken erotic stirrings in a young woman than to shock or splatter the screen with blood. Its a gothic fable filled with fairy tale symbolism, often unsettling images, and an intriguing narrative ambiguity. The film is in Czech, with English subtitles.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include 3 early shorts by director Jaromil Jires; new interview with Czechoslovak film scholar Peter Hames; interviews with actors Jaroslav Schallerova and Jan Klusak; alternate soundtrack; new English subtitle translation; and a critical essay.",1435449600,19,1952,5.327922077922078
7071384,5,B00UUOVLLS,"I've been waiting so long for Criterion to release this film. I've only ever watched it on Youtube with questionable translations. As soon as I purchase this, I will be writing a full review on the film and the product. For now, I can only recommend it as being a beautiful looking and fantastical coming of age story",1430784000,6,317,4.482758620689655
7071385,5,B00UUOVLLS,"What an excellent movie. Incipiently erotic scenarios are buzzkilled by everything from thievery, exploiterers, bad timing, bird flu (in a 1970 film??), hypocrites, exploiterers and every combination thereof. But it's not as bad as all of that sounds, nor for the fact that it's a puberty dream of a pre-WWI European girl.",1453420800,2,322,5.211538461538462
7071386,5,B00UUOVLLS,"A beautifuly shot film with a great soundtrack. If you have an artistic eye you will enjoy this one-of-a-kind cult classic. Highly recomended on blu ray(4K digital restoration) for more vibrant colors and picture clarity. Some mild sensuality and brief nudity. It also contains very little violence, but there being vampires, there is a little blood as well. A bizarre, weird yet beautiful coming of age movie filled with surreal and gothic images. A masterpiece indeed! Not for people with delicate sensibilities.",1451174400,2,514,5.280487804878049

7071388,4,B00UUOVLLS,"I really just HAD to see this....with all I'd read and all the modern psychedelic musicians loving this,well,it was something I had to experience.

I was prepared to just shrug my shoulders if it turned out super bloody or violent (like Jadorowski......Been there ,seen that),or weirdly fetishistic (like Kenneth Anger's sometimes soft gay-porn-ish-ness,again....I've been through that),or even sickeningly strange like Dali's ""eye cutting"" scene in his one early film.....

But, you know what, this is a pretty easy going film with lots to love about it, neat arty scenes , a mysterious storyline, and barring a slightly squeamish ,very tastefully done segment that hints at a bit of lesbian leaning (just an experimentation ....I think),this could be seen by anyone and enjoyed.  Many ""art"" films go way beyond and push many boundaries....and this one does have it's moment,...but nothing too extreme or wild that it couldn't just be thought of as a hallucination of the girl who is the movie's main focus.

I found this coming of age movie pretty enjoyable, for it's great mysterious scenes ,the twisted plot, and over-all feel.  This one is a keeper.  Something I could find a bit different every time I watch.  I do see how in it's day it must have been very ""foreward"" for the era of it's release, and daring because of what government was in charge at the time too.",1444089600,9,1372,4.939130434782609
7071389,5,B00UUOVLLS,"As usual with Criterion, this is an excellent package. The film is unusual, a wild fantasia from the perspective of a young girl. There are excellent supplemental materials, which really do help to provide the film with a cultural and artistic context. In particular, the three shorts by the director Jaromil Jires show his imagistic talents in development.",1441238400,3,357,5.172413793103448

7071392,3,B00UUOVLLS,"2 and half stars in reality for me. This is a beatific film full of sensual, quasi religious vampiric, satanic imagery but not much else. To me it felt quite forced but it does achieve a soft cinematographic tone overall,  I just don't get much meaning from the film other than a fantasy for people with Satanic/vampire fetish. Many people apparently equate her coming of age with vampire blood lust? lol whatever, makes 0 sense to me but I guess anything can be tied in with Zionistic mythology;drinking blood, eating flesh etc, nonsense witchcraft of Zionism.",1439683200,,561,4.84375
7071393,5,B00UUOVLLS,"In terms of genre, this is definitely a coming-of-age film. In terms of style, the film is surrealistic. In terms of directorial approach, it is ambiguous. My definition of ambiguity is not vagueness: there is nothing vague, or unfinished, or wishy-washy in this film. It has a clarion brightness, a burnished completeness; it is an experience in total immersion in a fully realized alternative world. My definition of ambiguity is a work of art open to multiple interpretations. My interpretation came to my mind at the very end of my first viewing, and was fully reinforced in my second. The film is dramatizes an integration of opposing forces, which, by the way, relates to one of Andre Breton's explanations of surrealism in his Second Manifesto. Scenes of festive activity alternate with scenes of menace. Characters sometimes malign are also benign. Bondage and release, threat and rescue, help and hurt, joy and terror, celebration and sadness - so the scenes pass by your wondering, mystified, exhilarated eyes, B-U-T at the very end, all the characters are involved in a huge dance/feast/togetherness sequence, even the monsters, transformed, are present. SO - instead of a scenario of good conquering evil, I would argue a kind of Jungian position, that is, Life integrates the Light and the Shadow into Wholeness. Valerie is alone at the end - no monsters, no threatening figures, no grandmother or best friends - she has reached a plateau of maturation from which she can envision her future life. It's both a wistful and an exciting perspective. What will happen next? More wonders, we might hope. She is ready for whatever comes next, and that, I would conclude, is the meaning of her week of wonders.",1438387200,14,1716,5.003496503496503

8708387,5,B00UUOVLLS,"Outstanding.  I was watching an earlier DVD that looked like it was shot on film - maybe 16mm - and then transferred to video, then shifted to film after a few vid generations....  I stopped watching.  It had captured me, but I couldn't watch it.  I searched Amazon and sure enough there was a brand new Blu-ray transfer from the original.  Two days after the heartbreak of psoriasis,  I could see again, and with new ears included.  Another masterful Criterion edition.  Thank you",1518912000,,481,4.710843373493976
8708388,2,B00UUOVLLS,"Hated it. Sorry, but it just wasn't that interesting to me. Out of the 24 CC films I own (most of them blind buys) this and The Uninvited are the only two I didn't like.
The story is dull, makes very little sense and to be honest, this is just some pervert directors excuse to film some preteen girl get naked. Don't get me wrong, it's visually stunning and has some very impressive cinematography. But at the end of the day I just have to call a spade a spade; it's just some perverts wet dream on film and not much more. I honestly do not see what all the hype is about.",1517961600,,572,4.070796460176991

8708390,5,B00UUOVLLS,The mystical compilation of a week of wonders with danger and scene shoots of old school filmmaking.

- Joseph Campbell

One of the great films of the 20th century, and unavailable for the last 30 years. I remember seeing ""Valerie"" for the first time in 1974. I had no idea what was going on, But it was one of the most beautiful films I'd ever seen, so I relaxed and watched the flow of images. I've seen it many times since (thanks to a bootleg copy).

The key to its understanding is that she is asleep from the start of the film to the end, and what we are seeing are her dreams, a unique approach to say the least. A good analysis of the film can be found on pages 229-236, The Czechoslovak New Wave by Peter Hames, U. of California Press, 1985.

The end of ""Valerie"" is, to me, profoundly touching. During most of the film, she freely interacts with the characters of her dreams, but by the end she has achieved a kind of detached enlightenment; though they call to her, Valerie refuses to interact with them anymore. And so at the end, in that Autumnal landscape, as her dreams dance around her, she climbs into her bed one last time......Sleep tight sweet Valerie, don't let the bedbugs bite.....""Fear is only a dream / so dream little one dream.""",1458604800,2,1328,4.325301204819277
8708395,2,B00UUOVLLS,"It was okay, not really a horror movie. Just a warning there is some nudity with the  main actress, who looks way to young, that just made the movie uncomfortable to watch. I know in some countries that's not as big of an issue but if you are from the US. it may bother you as much as it did me.",1458432000,3,295,3.8360655737704916
8708396,5,B00UUOVLLS,"If there's a fire in my house, first thing I would grab and run is DVD title <Time of the gypsis> by Emir Kusturica and <Double Life of Veronique) by Krzysztof Kieslowski. But that has been just changed.
I don't have to grab two titles anymore cause I just need one which is  <Valerie and Her Week of Wonders> will be enough.
This movie is a magic. It is like all of my dreams come true. Art of all art movies. It is in some way experimental but not difficult to watch. It is not like one of the Kenneth Anger's or Maya Deren's one of those legendary experimental filmmaker who wants to show how great they can show that their movie can be as far difficult it could be.
This movie is poetic and so beautiful that it is like seeing someone's dream and even something that I shouldn't peak because it's so pure.
Yes, there is evil and demons and even vampire in it. But they all seem so innocent.
The music include charming bell and lullaby make the movie even more like seeing something totally innocent.
The only difference between two movies that I own which are <Time of the gypsis> by Emir Kusturica and <Dobule Life of Veronique) by Krzysztof Kieslowski and this is that the two, it took years to actually buy them since they are so rare and took so much time to be released into dvd and this one it was so easy to achieve.
The best thing about this movie was 1. It was re-transferred into 4K HD telecine. So the picture was so so pure and bright. 2. Each shots are so beautiful that I preyed so much that this movie will never end. 3. There are not even a single person to be hate just like one of the Hayao's animation. Even the devils are really lovable.
The background tone was totally gothic and oldfashioned and it really made me felt like beeing in a fantasy world or in a fairy tale world.
The vaimpire and blood sucking and all the things at the end seems like 13 year old Valere's dream. At the end everything came back to normal.
The 13 old girl was actually the best thing in this movie. She was the most pure and innocent creature of all men kind. The camera shows everything in all kinds of aspect throughly. We cannot but to fall in love with her. It doesn;t matter how old she is. ( I think she is not 13 actually. She is like 20)
Her room is like a doll house and if I can, I would like to posses it and keep it forever even if I am a man.
Everything in this film from small piece to big furnitures seem to have meanings.  And they are so delicious.
The moment slow motion when actors are moving seems like I've never seen it like that before. Totally a new technique. I was like my mouth wide opened and totally mesmerised into that shot like forever.
Oh, it's a Czechoslovakia and the subtitle is great by the way. But there are not many dialogue anyway.
I can die for this movie. I won't even regret even if I die now becase I saw this one.",1454544000,2,2864,4.177215189873418
