877283,2,6304410255,"Bob Lazar is certainly a well spoken and articulate man. He sounds very reasonable. Unfortunately, there are issues. When Stan Friedman, probably the most well known and credible UFO researcher alive today, tried to verify Lazar's education, he found that Lazar's claims of degrees were bogus. He did not attend MIT; instead, he attended a community college at the same time he said he got his degree. In addition, he claimed attendance at a college that turns out to be a diploma mill: Pay money, get your degree. He graduated in the bottom third of his high school class. That's not the kind of record that gets you into MIT. The bottom line is that his claims in terms of education are entirely bogus. Now, you can say it's all a government cover up, but Friedman could find no college that had ever heard of him. Lazar tripped himself up without governmental intervention by fudging his dates. There are plenty of records available about him; it's just not the ones he would prefer you to see.

He apparently DID work for a government contractor at Area 51 for about six months. Now, does anyone reading this know how working for a contractor on a secret project works? I've been there. You're hired provisionally while an investgative service checks you out for a potential clearance. The higher the clearance, the more strict the review. It takes several months for even a relatively mild 'secret' clearance. For anything higher, it takes longer. Coincidentally, Lazar worked for this contractor about six months. His clearance application was rejected because, they said, his marriage was too unstable. (they'll reject you if you have a grandparent who lives in a communist country, too. Clearances are strange.) In any case, what do you think he did for the contractor during the time he was waiting for his security clearance to come though? Do you really think he was allowed to inspect and work on saucers, the most highly classified subject ever? Doubtful. What I suspect happened is that he worked for a contractor at a technician level for a few months before he was let go because his clearance was rejected. He was interested in the stories and saw an opportunity to capitalize on them. That's it. This unfortunate scenario in no way means there isn't a Roswell coverup. There's plenty of reliable evidence that there is, but Lazar himself is not part of the reliable testimony.",1174521600,5,2394,4.839024390243902
877284,3,6304410255,"[Referring to 1994 VHS - UFO Central Video edition]. I've watched this tape in its' entirety countless times, having enjoyed the ""science lessons"" section especially. However, there are some problems even with this part of the tape: Mr. Lazar doesn't seem to really believe he's a Physicist (voice analysis would probably bear this out) *and* how could any machine generate enough power to manipulate massive objects through unfathomable distances? When these machines engage their time-leaping mechanism from Cleveland why isn't Mars drawn within spitting distance to us? If he states that there are certain accessible gravitational ""catapults"", if you will, then I wouldn't shake my head.
The final section, which covers supposed alien intervention in the affairs of mankind, is presented intelligently - Lazar does not try to sound persuasive; here he sounds credible in describing an experience he still does not understand. This is the part of the tape UFOlogists might point to as evidence of ""government disinformation"". Some viewers might take great offense in the religious reference here.
I took offense in the disrespectful way the interview with Dr. Edward Teller was handled. This Physicists' apparent reluctance to discuss the use of alternate methods of propulsion for space travel is interesting, though the audio is muffled. Then it appears a photograph of Bob Lazar is waved in his face - it's been said that Teller recommended the former to the worksite we've all heard about.
More and more evidence is revealed these days regarding saucer-shaped ""experimental"" aircraft, originating from tera-firma. Think about it.

7871269,5,6304410255,"The Lazar Tape... and excerpts from the Government Bible featuring Bob Lazar
Written, Produced and Directed by Gene Huff and Bob Lazar
Presented by Bob Lazar
Duration: Approximately 40 minutes

In this program physicist Bob Lazar explains that he once worked as part of a back engineering team whos job was to see if the technology of what we commonly call a UFO could be duplicated with earth materials. Then, as part of an interesting science lesson he reveals how such a craft operates and later where it came from. He then throws in a few interesting things he learned concerning the alien beings that built the craft and how they have historically interacted with humans.

Bob states that the program he was involved with consisted of 3 projects:
1. Project Galileo - which dealt with gravity propulsion
2. Project Sidekick - which dealt with a beam weapon that had a neutron source and was focused by a gravity lens
3. Project Looking Glass - which dealt with the physics of seeing back in time.
He states that he himself was not personally involved with the hardware of Projects Sidekick or Looking Glass and that those projects are beyond the scope of this video.

The program was produced in 1991 and has been transferred from videotape to DVD. The picture quality is therefore not all that great - it's a little distorted and lacks crispness. If this were a film that would matter, but the value in this program lies with the information that is presented. Bob Lazar seems to me to be an intelligent, articulate and sincere man and nothing in this video seems unbelievable or outlandish to my mind. To anyone interested in UFO's you owe it to yourself to get hold of this DVD and watch it.

At the beginning of the video Bob Lazar presents himself saying:

""During late 1988 and early 89 I worked on the propulsion systems of extra-terrestrial vehicles for the United States Government. The hardware and technology I was exposed to should be placed in the proper hands of the scientific community, and it is the right of every person on earth to know, that there is physical evidence
which proves that there is life elsewhere and that at least one form of that life has been here.""

... then adding...

""I'm a physicist. I have degrees in physics and electronics technology. I worked in a number of scientific programs some of which required top secret and above top secret security clearances, of which the most easily verifiable is my early 1980's job here at Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility in Los Alimos, New Mexico. Between December of '88 and April of '89 I worked as a senior staff physicist in what has to be the most secret project in history. My place of work was at a facility known as S4 on the Nellis Air Force Range in central Nevada. Area S4 is located approximately 15 miles south of the infamous Area 51 at Groom Lake where the U2 and S71 spy planes were developed. For the duration of my employment at S4 I was paid by the United States Navy.""

Bob then begins the science lesson. It's a bit like ""Interstellar travel for dummies"":

""At the beginning of this first section I'm going to give you three short science lessons and once you've learnt them you'll not only know more about interstellar travel than almost anyone else in the world, but you'll know the actual method another civilisation has used to travel from another star system to the planet Earth.""

""The truth of the matter is that travelling these distances does require a level of technology that man has not yet achieved.""

""The fact is that when you're dealing with space-time and you enjoy the capability of generating an intense gravitational field the fastest way from point A to B is to distort or warp or bend the space-time between point A and B bringing point A and B closer together. The more intense the gravitational field the greater the distortion of space-time and the shorter the distance between points A and B.""

""The effect of a gravitational field on space-time is something that we've been able to observe but not experiment with. This is due to our inability to generate a gravitational field, and up until this point in time a great mass such as a star, planet, or moon was the only source of a discernable gravitational field that we're aware of.""

""Just as the gravitational field around a great mass such as a planet distorts space and time any gravitational field whether naturally occuring or generated, distorts space and time in a similar manner. Now the great benefit of generating an intense gravitational field is not only that you can turn it on but you can turn it off. When we generate an intense gravitational field we can distort the space-time and in turn the distance between the point where we are and the point where we wanna be. We can then position ourselves at the point where we wanna be and then *stop* generating the gravitational field, allowing space-time to return to its natural form. In this manner we can travel great distances with little linear movement and this is how space-time distortion translates into reduced distance.""

Bob summarizes after this first part:

Question: How is it possible to cross the vast expanses of space required for interstellar travel without exceeding the speed of light?
Answer: This is accomplished by generating an intense gravitational field distorting space-time and allowing you to cross many light years of space in little or no time and without travelling in a linear mode near the speed of light.

There's more to learn so the science lesson continues...

Question: How do you generate a gravitational field (where generating means to access and amplify such a field)?
Answer: You must have access to an element which is heavy enough for the gravity A wave to extend past the perimeter of the atom then you can access and amplify it for space-time distortion.

Question: What is the power source for this type of travel?
Answer: The power source is a reactor which uses element 115 as its fuel, and uses a total annihilation reaction to provide the heat which it converts to energy.

Bob then extrapolates:

""In this reactor element 115 is used as a target and is bombarded with protons in a small particle accelerator. When a proton plugs into the nucleus of an atom of 115 it increases its atomic number and becomes an atom of element 116, which decays instantly. What element 116 releases or radiates as it decays is anti-matter. What is anti-matter? Anti-matter is the exact counterpart of matter which has a charge and a spin that is in the opposite of all matter. When combined with any matter in our universe anti-matter reacts and completely converts to energy."" [Note: Unlike your standard fission reaction - nuclear exposion - where less than 1% of nuclear material is converted to energy.]

""The anti-matter is released in a vacuum into a tuned tube which keeps it from reacting with the matter that surrounds it. It is then directed towards a gaseous matter target at the end of the tube. Matter and anti-matter collide and annihilate totally converting to energy. The heat from this reaction is converted into electrical energy in a near 100% efficient thermo-electrical generator. This is a device that converts heat directly into electrical energy.""

""I've got a couple of quick comments about element 115 for those of you who are interested. By virtue of the way it is used in the reactor it depletes very slowly and only 223 grams of 115 which is just under half a pound can be utilised for a peiod of 20 to 30 years. Element 115's melting point is 1740 degrees Celcius.""

Having stated that he personally has seen a disc or saucer in flight, Bob goes on to describe some more about how it operates:

""Now when the disc travels near another source of gravity such as a planet or moon it doesn't use the same method of travel that we learned about [before]. When a disc is near another source of gravity like Earth the gravity A wave that propagates outward from the disc is phase-shifted into the gravity B wave which propagates outward from the Earth, and this creates lift.""

""When the gravitational field around the disc is so intense that the space-time distortion around the disc achieves maximum distortion and is folded up into this [previously described] heart-shaped form the disc can't be seen from any vantage point and for all practical purposes is invisible.""

Describing the area S4 where he worked Bob advises against trying to fly in there (!):

""The airspace around S4 is restricted and if any unwelcome aircraft strays into the outer sector they radio the pilot and instruct him or her to leave. If that pilot continues and strays into the middle sector jets will be scrambled to escort the intruding aircraft out. If for any reason whatsoever that aircraft penetrates into the
inside sector before jets can be airborne ground to air missiles will neutralize the intruder. The moral of this story is don't try and fly into S4.""

Describing who or what brought the disc to planet Earth Bob goes on to say:

""This technology that you've learned about thus far was brought here by some alien beings from the Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2 star system. These stars are located in the constellation of Reticulum which can only be seen from the Southern Hemisphere. Zeta Reticuli is a binary star system which means it is two stars and is located approximately 30 light years from Earth. These beings are from Reticullum 4 which is the fourth planet out from Zeta Reticuli 2.""

""The beings are 3 to 4 feet tall and weigh 25 to 50 pounds. They have greyish skin and large heads with almond shaped wrap-around eyes. They have very slight nose, mouth, and ear positions and are hairless. These beings said they had been visiting Earth for a long time and presented photographic evidence which they contended was over 10,000 years old. these beings said that man was the product of externally corrected evolution. They said that man as a species had been genetically altered 65 times.""

This information is presented very matter-of-factly and without much excitement. Mr. Lazar sure doesn't *seem* crazy! His rationale for releasing this information appears altruistic and based upon the public's right to know, not because he stands to make a fortune because of it. His following comments hint at this:

""There's a small segment of the United States Government that makes scientific and technological judgements from a knowledge base that is not available to the general public. If the following information is true the United States Government also makes judgements on a historical, philosophical, and even theological level from a knowledge base that is not available to the general public.""

""If what I have just presented to you is true and the government is keeping this a secret how can I make a video telling you about it? Well the bottom line is if there are any repercussions for making this video it would simply confirm that what I told you is true... so what you do with this information is up to you.""

I suggest that there are two likely scenarios involved here: Either Bob Lazar is some sort of pathological liar - a modern day snake-oil salesman if you will , or perhaps Bob is telling us the truth as he knows it. Watch this DVD and decide for yourself!",1250294400,3,11279,4.734829168791433

7871271,4,6304410255,"Bob Lazar's 'credibility' or 'credentials' have nothing to do with the ideas that he presents.  Either you understand physics and discuss that or you engage in pointless ad hominems.

This DVD is a lecture about gravitational spacetime distortion, quantum gravity, atomic fusion, anti-matter, and energy.  For instance, as Lazar notes, there are two types of gravity: large scale macro gravity, and micro gravity that is ""locked within the particles"" that comprise the atom.  Which is, insofar as I understand it, quantum gravity. Lazar is also familiar with the notion that gravitons may be the medium (or ""messenger particle"")for gravity (as photons are for light). Given that Lazar taped this lecture in 1991, if he is the charlatan he is accused of being, then his grasp of the then nascent idea of quantum gravity borders on the amazing.

The purpose of this lecture is to explain the power source for the gravity amplifying system in extraterrestrial spacecraft.  Suffice it to say that it is a controlled matter/anti-matter reaction that is converted by a 'thermo-electric generator' into the electrical energy needed to operate the gravity amplifying devices that allow the disc to 'fly' and create spacetime distortions that essentially collapse the spacial distance between massive objects such as stars or planets.

In a way, Bob Lazar is irrelevant.  The only salient point is whether his physics is correct.",1215475200,11,1420,5.252212389380531
7871272,5,6304410255,"Bottom line is this.. Back when he first made his claims, the scientific community said element 115 did not exist.. Strangely enough, now it does ?!? Furthermore, his background was checked by investigative reporter George Knapp. Although Knapp could find no evidence that Bob Lazar had studied/worked at any of those places, he found Bob Lazar's name in the school phone directory. He admitted it seemed to him someone had gone to a great deal of effort to erase his past. (Even his birth record could not be found at the hospital where he was born). Also, they asked him to go through a lie detector test performed by an ex-cop and he passed with flying colours ! (lie detector tests are often used in court..).

Furthermore, the recent Disclosure Project of Dr. Steven Greer MD now brings the possibility that this man's claims were true, ... And like he points out in the video, if anything happened to him, it would be proof that what he said was the truth.

The powers that be ARE hiding something to the general public, folks. Make no mistake about it.",1205193600,7,1059,4.627659574468085
