8552674,4,B00AJJXB8U,"Very informative documentary about the making of the 1978 horror classic. Featuring all the major participants, both in front and behind of the camera, except for Donald Pleasance who passed away in 1995. If you are a big fan of the film, this would be a great addition to your Halloween collection. The only downside is that it is on a DVD-R with no menu page or special features and the package art is generic looking.",1432425600,,420,4.5394736842105265
