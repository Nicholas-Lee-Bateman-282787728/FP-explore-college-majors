Sometimes you watching cinema with zero expectations and get pleasantly surprised by a film that may be having a limited budget or no big stars but has its heart in its place. Dekh Re Dekh is one such film. Rahat Kazmi's debut directorial attempt is impressive. Though the pacing of the film is slow the dialogues keep you in splits and forever engaged. The ending is truly unexpected.
Vijay Raaz though often over the top with some risqu dialogues, gets his comic timing right and is the most fun to watch.
It is recommended for those who don't really fancy big stars in their movies and are craving for a truly `hatke' film. Go check this black comedy out; you won't be disappointed!!",1302134400,,858,4.506410256410256
