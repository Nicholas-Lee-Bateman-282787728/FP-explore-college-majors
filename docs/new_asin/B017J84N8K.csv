my dad was a history teacher - this was used in his class - it is a great kids film fun for all ages 2- to 102. (lol) it is worth it if you can find it.",1489795200,,421,3.5869565217391304
8739475,5,B017J84N8K,"As a pre-school teacher in the 1990s, we used this VHS tape as a learning tool during the fall season. It covered our unit on the pilgrims and Indians as it also covered the first Thanksgiving. Obviously, VHS tapes and players are out dated, but the story is so amazingly done. I am no longer a teacher but am so hopeful to purchase a DVD so my grandchildren can learn through the amazing voice of Tennessee Ernie Ford and others, the story of the Mayflower and the first Thanksgiving. I have searched high and low for a DVD and would snatch one up for each of the grandchildren to have at their homes - along with me having a copy, as I certainly would watch myself. I wish they would make a DVD. I just know everyone would snatch one up.",1461024000,5,739,4.24822695035461
8739476,5,B017J84N8K,"As a young child growing up in the 60s/70s, I used to wait anxiously every year to watch MOUSE ON THE MAYFLOWER on TV every Thanksgiving.  It is a such a cute way to teach kids about the 1st Thanksgiving, the Pilgrims and Indians from the perspective of William (pronounced Will-em by the Mouse) than I've seen in the last 45 years.  I don't understand why they don't show this on TV anymore, but probably it has to do with the presentation of the Indians - however in the end of this movie, both the Indians and the Pilgrims all become friends (including the Mouse version of each) and celebrate and give thanks for all they have and for their new friendships.  It really is a wonderful movie.  I bought the VHS version of this movie 10 yrs ago but have not been able to see a DVD version of this movie yet on Amazon.  Hopefully one day it will be available on DVD or as streaming video.  Everyone will really enjoy this movie on Thanksgiving !",1448150400,3,945,4.3107344632768365
