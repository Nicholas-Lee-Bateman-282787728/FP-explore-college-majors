4518114,5,B0050QNOBG,"This DVD had some hard exercises and they are very intense! I couldn't get thru most of the segments on the first try. And 2 days later I still felt the pain in my abs, sides and back! This is a step up from The Abs Diet for Women Workout, which I also loved. I give this 5 stars because Jessica Smith is the best trainer and her workouts never fail!",1321747200,14,350,3.943661971830986

4518117,4,B0050QNOBG,"This DVD, let by fitness instructor Jessica Smith, offers five fast-past, challenging workouts, each just over 10 minutes in length.  Smith instructs live with two background exercisers, Madison and Jersey; Jersey offers modifications for some of the movements.  The Main Menu offers options for playing all of the workouts, selecting each of the five workouts individually, or customizing your workout.

I have listed each of the workouts below and provided a brief overview.

AB REHAB
This routine features two circuits, each consisting of five exercises.  Smith goes through the circuit once, and in the second round, she and Madison make things a bit more challenging, while Jersey repeats the first circuit.  Exercises include crunch with diagonal reach, cross crunch, knee tuck, seated Russian twist, and plank with moving feet.

PILATES FOR A TIGHTER TUMMY
This is more of a fusion Pilates segment; Smith notes that the moves are inspired by both Pilates and ballet.  She starts with a modified roll back and also includes versions of scissors, hip lifts, and teaser; planks with leg movements conclude this routine as well.

CORE MAKEOVER
Smith mentions that this routine focuses on the entire core, which includes not just the abs but also the back and even the hips, butt, and thighs.  She opens with a core tightener and then a plank with a leg sweep.  Additional moves include crunches, side plank work, and wide Supermans.  She finishes with a ""plank climb,"" stepping the feet to either side.

FAT FREE CARDIO AB BLAST
In this section, Smith alternates brief cardio bursts with ""recovery"" moves.  Several of the moves involve jumping in and out of a plank position, including a squat thrust and a plank ski jump.  Recovery moves were move basic, such as knee raises and v-sits.

TURBO CHARGED BELLY TONING
This segment uses optional light dumbbells; Smith and Madison use 3 lbs.  The first half of the routine is performed standing and includes moves to target the core such as a Figure 8 and triangle side reach.  The second half is performed on the floor, adding the weights for half rollback, a weighted cross crunch, and a one-armed weighted roll up.  This was my favorite segment, as the addition of the weights felt like it made the moves more effective.

The Main Menu of this DVD also includes instructions for downloading an optional sixth ""bonus"" program from the Gaiam web site.  Here is a brief description of that program:

WAIST WHITTLERS
This routine emphasizes the obliques with many twisting movements.  Smith begins with the same core tightener that she did in the Core Makeover segment, and she then goes on to do several plank-based exercises, adding rotational movement.  This routine also includes several side plank exercises.  Smith finishes with more plank work plus a crouching knee rotation move.

These are nicely done routines that are likely to appeal to intermediate and above exercisers.  To me, however, many of the exercises on this DVD felt like they were being creative just for the sake of being creative, not necessarily being more effective.  Furthermore, they are VERY heavy on plank work, and the modifications shown by Jersey do NOT offer alternatives for the planks.  Therefore, those with any wrist or shoulder issues might want to stay away from this DVD.",1403049600,10,3313,5.016483516483516
4518118,5,B0050QNOBG,"If you want to get your abs in shape these exercises will do it.  They are hard, but effective.  She has an easy option for each one, so you can complete the reps.  Great work out tape.",1369699200,4,185,3.945945945945946
4518119,5,B0050QNOBG,"This dvd was really good. This was my first dvd from Jessica Smith and now I have many. She is a great instructor. She is cheerful person, shows you how to do the exercsie correctly, and always offers some type of modification if needed. I didn't think that I would be sweating so much from a dvd that isn't mostly cardio.",1362355200,3,322,4.295081967213115
4518120,5,B0050QNOBG,These workouts are great!  I am an ex-fitness professional and really like the variety and Jessica's instruction.  One of my favorite DVD's.,1359590400,3,140,5.318181818181818
4518121,5,B0050QNOBG,"This workout seems to be fairly easy but not so when you start! It is only 10 minutes each, but it is very worth it! Excellent!!!",1347235200,3,129,4.0
4518122,5,B0050QNOBG,"This DVD contains 6 short abdominal or core routines which are about 10 to 11 minutes each.  These are intermediate to advanced workouts, with challenging and intense moves.  Some of the moves are different and interesting, so if you are looking for variety, this excellent DVD is it.  One recommendation is that the workouts could be a little longer.  But you may do all the workouts, or play it in any combination.  Plus, it would be a good idea to add a separate stretch section.

All workouts are fast paced, with no time wasted.  Jessica Smith instructs clearly and demonstrates along with two other toned ladies, with one usually showing the easier intermediate moves.

8451770,5,B0050QNOBG,I LOVE this DVD! Jessica Smith seems like a down to earth person! I like how her moves flow right into each move without ever having to break and reposition. She cues very well and she doesn't chit chat endlessly but has the right energy to help you get through the moves. I also like how you can see her struggle as well and when you feel like dying or ready to give up she'll tell you how many more reps there are left. I also like how she counts for you instead of having to count it yourself. She along with Ellen Barrett are my favorite fitness coahes that I always go back to.,1515456000,,582,4.069565217391304
