8032301,3,B0002V7OKG,"how dare you ASSUME the great Mr. Schmeling was a ""Nazi Party Member"" quite the opposite actually. Max NEVER joined the Nazi party and during ""Crystalnacht"" or ""Night of Broken Glass"" in 1938 Berlin, Max hid the 2 young sons of his jewish tailor Henri Lewin in his hotel room at the Excelsior; he did this at great risk to himself and his wife Anny. when asked 50 years later about it, he simply said he did it because ""it was the duty of a man"" Max went on to donate millions to various charities throughout his life and remained life long friends with Joe Louis, and even helped pay for his funeral, since he was destitute, does that sound like a Nazi to you? One of his more famous quotes, in 1992 or 1993 i believe, when asked how he would like to be remebered, he responded ""I don't want anyone to say I was a good athlete, but worth nothing as a human being - I couldn't bear that"" The great Max Schmeling passed 6 weeks ago, rest in peace champ......",1110844800,11,957,4.2349726775956285
8032302,5,B0002V7OKG,"A wonderful PBS/American Experience documentary concerning the second fight between Heavyweight Champion Joe Louis and the challenger Max Schmeling. Schmeling, a German Nazi Party member, had defeated Louis two years earlier to give Louis his first pro loss. This film not only covers the fight itself, but also the political and social ramifications that were worldwide. I've been a huge boxing fan my whole life, with this fight being my favorite. If you don't know the outcome......I won't spoil it for you! And the winner is.........YOU if you buy this DVD!!!!",1105833600,5,564,5.208791208791209
8032303,5,B0002V7OKG,"What a tremendous program.  ""The Fight"" takes the viewer back to the 1938 boxing re-match between Joe Louis and Max Schmeling.  But it was really much more than that.

You will also see Louis struggling to be seen as the ""good"" African-American boxer, as opposed to the ""bad"" Jack Johnson; Max Schmeling's rise to prominence in Germany, and his ""deal"" with the Nazis; the history of boxing and the struggles of African-Americans between the reigns of Johnson and Louis; and the urgency of the times, when much of the world was beginning to realize the threat of Nazi Germany.  This show did an excellent job of putting this match into perspective; it was more than man vs. man; it was more like a clash of idealogies.  Freedom vs. Oppression.  Good vs. evil.

It is unfair to think of Schmeling in this way, as he was generally a good man.  He even helped to pay for Louis' funeral expenses when Joe died in 1981.  But the reality was, he was being used by the Nazis as their standard-bearer for the Aryan race, so when Louis defeated him in 1938, it was more than just a win.  Coming on the heels of Jesse Owens' great Olympic performance in 1936, it was a resounding slap to the face of the racist Nazis.  And the fact that Louis knocked Schmeling out in the 1st round made it that much more emphatic.

This match is rightly remembered as one of the most important and dramatic in history.  PBS has done it justice!
