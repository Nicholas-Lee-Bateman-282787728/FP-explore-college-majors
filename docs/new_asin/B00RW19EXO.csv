6936016,5,B00RW19EXO,"Walter is a wonderful movie. The humor is offbeat for sure but that's the way I like it. There is awesome character development and they all evolve from the beginning to the end. Great use of foreshadowing. Don't let any preconceived ideas about heaven, hell or the son of God stop you from seeing this movie.

6936021,4,B00RW19EXO,"This is a quirky movie about how we may try to protect ourself from feeling grief by self imposed rigid control. The movie opens with a young Walter at his father's burial. Fast forward ten years when we see Walter's  extreme control over his life so he could perform what he deems his important mission - all to keep a lid on pain. His behavior was really out there and that was supposed to be funny - so the movie is called a comedy but it is not. I laughed maybe once. The shrink (Macy) was eccentric and comical. One character, Vince, is meant to get laughs but his behavior is only obnoxious. Walter's mom is very anxious and 90% of all scenes are filled with tension, I like the movie a lot, for some odd reasons, it touched me and reminded me how amazing the subconscious is.",1435190400,,782,4.283783783783784
6936022,5,B00RW19EXO,"A weird, eccentric, --and big-hearted comedy that falls somewhere between ""Ghost World"" and ""Donnie Darko"".  EXCELLENT script and EXCELLENT acting by all and sundry!

This one definitely deserves the same sort of cult classic status that the aforementioned have garnered.",1435017600,,271,5.75
6936023,5,B00RW19EXO,Well written fine tuned by excellent actors and actresses. The story line was superb and the comedy was just the right touch. I am recommending WALTER highly.,1434240000,2,158,4.888888888888889
6936024,5,B00RW19EXO,"Walter Gary Benjamin (Andrew J. West) is with his mother, Karen (Virginia Madsen) at his father's funeral as a young boy. He explains that ""This was the moment my life changed forever because God started speaking to me, He gave me a purpose in life"". For Walter, that purpose is The Judgements, or deciding a place in heaven or hell for other people's eternity. He believes himself to be the Son of God and making these permanent decisions for his father to go to heaven. You could say that as Walter grows into a young man, he is wound pretty tightly, quite orderly, sticks to routines and is confident in his own abilities of assigning people to their placement.

After his morning breakfast of scrambled eggs along with his mother...again, he is out of the door to his job at the movie theater where he is a ticket taker. He feels somewhat alone, a sort of outcast amongst the other theater staff including his boss, Corey (Jim Gaffigan) until he sees the new and beautiful young woman, Kendall (Leven Rambin) working in concessions. Believing himself much below her station and being convinced by another mouthy theater worker that he would have no chance with her, Walter still cannot get her out of his mind - and she is going to heaven, this is for sure. Karen is concerned about her son and most of the time her reasoning is quite interesting and quirkily funny as she convinces him that he needs to see a psychiatrist as Walter believes he might just be ""crazy"" after he meets 'Greg'. He begins seeing Dr. Corman (William H. Macy) who has a likable appeal and a lighter psychoanalytical style. As they begin to explore the nature of what is ""crazy"" things in Walter's world are revealed slowly and importantly to the audience. I found myself laughing several times with the words chosen by Dr. Corman as his character portrayal is definitely one of a very comfortable psychiatrist.

Written by Paul Shoulberg and directed by Anna Mastro, a whole cast of supporting characters come out of the background to fully round out this dramatic comedy and give Walter's life its gusto. They include, Justin Kirk, Neve Campbell, and Peter Facinelli among others. Mastro directs Walter to act in such a way of subtle nuances that are appreciated from the way he speaks to the way he holds his body and positions himself. She also has you questioning just what is going on. Peeling back the layers of Walter's world is a great way to spend an evening and to also find plenty of heart within the mix.",1433980800,4,2496,4.644796380090498
6936025,4,B00RW19EXO,"This movie is not only funny, but touches the heart of what it is to be human. Great acting and a kinda ""gotcha"" back story that makes you happy you are watching it.",1433030400,2,165,4.03030303030303
6936026,5,B00RW19EXO,"Full disclosure:  I love this movie because it is, among other things, a love letter to Indianapolis.  There's Main Street in Speedway, Long's Bakery, and most touching for me, Holy Trinity Church (where my grandparents, parents and I worshipped and which the Archdiocese closed last year).  So yes, some of the shots were repetitive, but they made Indianapolis look so beautiful.  There's also William H. Macy as a psychiatrist with a very unorthodox technique.  And when I say thought-provoking, I mean that you might spend some time wondering whether Walter really is assigning people to their places in the afterlife, or you might dismiss it as a silly premise.  But don't many of us, in everyday life, make snap judgments about who is going to heaven and who is going to hell in the firm belief that our judgments are based in objective truth?  Isn't there some Walter in many of us?  And why do we do that?",1432512000,2,912,4.727848101265823
6936027,5,B00RW19EXO,"WALTER is touching, quirky, and entertaining. If you enjoy William H. Macy, you'll love him as the no-holds-barred psychiatrist. If you aren't familiar with Andrew (Andy) West, you won't forget him after this masterful performance. I absolutely love Justin Kirk. And the rest of the cast excel in their parts. No big special effects in this film...just from-the-heart portrayals of people struggling with their demons. Rent WALTER. Buy WALTER. Watch WALTER. Enjoy WALTER!",1431302400,2,471,5.465753424657534

6936029,2,B00RW19EXO,"William Macy is great, all the characters are frustrating with the way they can't get their crap together.  The big revelations at the end are underwhelming.",1430697600,,157,5.038461538461538
6936030,5,B00RW19EXO,"The movie starts out confusing, reflecting the thoughts and feelings of the main character Walter. Walter is about 19 now, and trying to understand life and where he fits into it; but he has an idea that he may be crazy...or at least that he has a ghost.  A ghost problem. A ghost that won't leave him alone and keeps trying to get him to think and decide.

And that is what the whole story is about. Think and decide. Decide what you want most.

Therapists will tell you that IF you are ""stuck"" the important thing to do is to DECIDE what is more important to you. To continue to be where you are...or is there something you want more. IF there is something you want more, do you want it more than what ever benefits you are getting from staying immobilized, and avoiding...IE STUCK.

A young man developed a pathology to meet his need when he was a child, but when he became a young man, he was ready...and wanted other things more than just to be protected from painful thoughts; such as a beautiful nice girl, meaning, self, truth...

SPOILER ALERT...I am going to give the plot...so IF you are a mental health professional...and want to use this movie as a tool to address your client's issues in a less threatening way than head on with them...you can see the issues it contains and decide if you will use this film. The rest of you may not want to read this if you are seeing the film just for enjoyment. For you, if you are concerned about content; there are no sexually explicit scenes, there is one sexually explicit conversation, and a few cuss words. Probably PG-13 (realistically for what kids see on TV during prime time in 2015, is probably not as bad.)

Essentially a young man, who is the only child, and the center of his parent's eyes...especially his father who he idolizes; gets a triple whammy out of life. His father is dying and dies of cancer, during this time he realizes his father is having an affair with a nurse caring for him, and he realizes his mother and he have been cheated on and emotionally deserted by his father...though the father stays with the family ...in fact he doesn't stay, he dies: so his mother and he are both physically deserted too. These events happen when the child is about 7-8 years old, the most moral age, the last formative years.

So, he creates a world in his head to make sense of everything, and give him structure that he can keep his emotions at bay, defend against pain, guilt, shame, hurt...and even give him some self esteem and power that he did not have in the devastation of his life.

When he found out his father was cheating....cheating on his mother and himself....he wished he would go to Hell.  Then his father died of cancer. And the guilt and the pain and the confusion tore him apart so badly, that he created the belief that he WAS the son of God, whose JOB it was to see and say where everyone was to go. To Heaven or to Hell. It was not his decision (so he was not at fault to tell his father to go to Hell), it was just his JOB to say Heaven or Hell. BUT...It takes the movie for his to discover this.

He does not realize any of this to start, but starts going to a psychologist because suddenly a ""ghost"" has started harassing him, asking him to decide if he should go to Heaven or Hell and this is bothering him. The psychologist doesn't do much, a little paradoxical intention...a little reflection and pushing buttons. It is the subconscious directing it all.

The acting is good. The main character's body language and facial expressions are quite well done, you see the growth reflected in these to the degree that a person that was really annoying to start, is attractive at the end. The other actors also do a very good job, so that your attention is not taken away from the story to think...""that seems fake.""  Though if you have not dealt with disordered thinking, or really take a hard look at that ""odd"" person you run into occasionally...you may feel the whole story is too bizarre to be believed. If you think that,...wait...your turn is coming...maybe your parent...or stranger in the grocery...just wait.",1430697600,5,4106,4.4672897196261685
6936031,5,B00RW19EXO,Loved the way the story developed.  Walter and his mother were both pretty odd and I kept wondering how they both could be so off . . . then the ending brought it all together and everything made sense.  William Faulkner used this same style.  I was inspired to not waste the time I have; to forgive; and to love..,1430438400,,314,4.2

6936045,5,B00RW19EXO,"An excellent film reminiscent of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""and ""Being John Malkovich"". Strange, quirky, and original. I am truly baffled by the criticisms of people asking, ""Is it a comedy? Is it a drama?"" Whatever emotions it evoked in you or themes you identified with, that's what the film is. ""Watler"" reminds me of ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"". It will engage the feely-parts of anyone who has ever had to cope with loss or wondered ""am I crazy? Am I okay?"" but never intended to take itself too seriously. Don't think too hard about it. Just drink it in.",1427587200,,581,4.650485436893204

6936050,3,B00RW19EXO,"I definitely wouldn't give this any higher than three stars. It is not horrible, but it I can tell that it is a stretched out short story, not a fully realized feature. This has to do with the story being too thin. It is like trying to make an omelet with no eggs. The directing is fine. The acting is quite good. I don't feel I would have missed anything important if I hadn't bothered to watch this film. Ultimately as satisfying as a dry piece of bread when one was expecting a croissant.",1426982400,2,491,4.23404255319149
6936051,5,B00RW19EXO,"I LOVED this film. I loved it so much that I went to see it twice in a week, with four different friends, in two different theaters in different cities, because I knew it wasn't going to be on the big screen for long. (I don't go to movies often because most major theatrical releases don't appeal to me. If I'm feeling ""iffy"" about a film, I'd rather wait and watch it on my Roku box at home. Clearly, my efforts to see Walter twice is a big deal.)
The film's honest, vulnerable quirkiness made me want to give all the characters a big hug (except Vince, because: ew.). There's so much heart in this story, so much love and confusion and yearning ... as well as plenty of laughs, thanks to the screenwriting by Paul Shoulberg. I appreciated that the film portrayed a character with strong faith and a daily prayer practice without laughing at them for that faith.
Andrew J. West fabulously played Walter as an awkward ten-year-old in a 20-year-old's body (Look at him running without moving his arms! Staring mutely at his crush! Polishing the brass plate on his ticket box!) ... such a contrast from his work in The Walking Dead. West's acting in the character's painful therapy sessions and catharsis looked and felt very authentic to someone who's had a few cathartic experiences in therapists' offices, myself. Playing opposite him, William Macy was shaggily fabulous in his role as Walter's therapist. Macy's character (a) genuinely wants to help his patients fix their problems rather than collect their payment for as many weeks as possible, and (b) isn't afraid to laugh and call his patients ""crazy"" to their faces, to make a point. This is my kind of therapist.
It seems like the character of ""Greg"" was written for Justin Kirk, who played him with a perfect balance of snark and pathos. Virginia Madsen must've loved her role as Walter's mom: the ""mom"" role could've been stereotypical and one-dimensional (as so many roles for women her/our age can be), but even in her limited screen time, the script and her acting allowed us sweet/crazy glimpses into her relationship with her son and I loved her turnaround at the end of the film, too.
All in all, I'm telling everyone I know to see the film ... at least once!",1426896000,2,2227,4.654822335025381
6936052,5,B00RW19EXO,"This is a unique comedy drama full of great performances. Virginia Madsen and Andrew K. West are excellent. I don't want to give too much away.

6936063,5,B00RW19EXO,"While the presence of several well known actors including William H. Macy and Virginia Madsen have been referenced frequently in reviews and promotions of screenwriter Paul Shoulberg's movie ""Walter"", the film wouldn't be as poignant if not for the stellar portrayal of the main character Walter by Andrew J. West. From his role as a cannibal in ""The Walking Dead"" to a Christian (of sorts) in ""Walter"", Andrew's ability to create an awkward, ostensibly autistic 20-something and then transform him into a more relatable character as the story progresses is the beauty of watching this film. If you watch any independent film this year, make it ""Walter"".",1426464000,15,654,5.121495327102804

8696035,4,B00RW19EXO,"Okay, so this was yet another film with a character that only exists in someone's mind.  However, don't let the repetition of that theme prevent you from enjoying this movie.  It was extremely well acted with interesting dialogue and character interactions.  It doesn't take to long to realize that the main character Walter is suffering from complex bereavement, but the intricacy of the plot behind it is worth watching.",1487376000,,422,5.086956521739131
8696036,2,B00RW19EXO,"Despite actually being in the movie (I'm the fat guy in shorts at the snack counter), I can't say I enjoyed this film.  The first two-thirds are the most interesting, but they suffer from an overt twee-ness that grates upon the nerves, as well as what can only be described as a visual exposition dump.  The last third then shies away from the themes of mental illness and instead reveals that Walter isn't OCD or schizophrenic; no, he just hasn't had a good cry.  The conclusion is overly simplistic insulting to anyone with any kind of mental health concerns.  Also: despite what the poster shows, don't expect much out of William H. Macy; he has maybe five minutes of screen time.  Finally--and this is a very filmic nit-pic--the whole film is shown from Walter's POV, except for one brief scene featuring his mother at the store.  It does expand a bit on her character, but so little is given to her elsewhere, and this is the only alternate POV scene in the movie, that it distracts and interrupts the flow of the film.",1486598400,4,1024,4.5683060109289615

8696038,5,B00RW19EXO,Wow. Unexpectedly amazing movie.,1483315200,,32,7.25
8696039,5,B00RW19EXO,"An intelligent, quirky, affecting story that addresses some deep questions without any pretension.  Excellent direction by Anna Mastro, wonderful performances by all the actors, and a really good soundtrack, too.  I laughed out loud and cried a little bit, too.  One of the best films, independent or otherwise, that I've seen in a very long time.  5 stars!",1480550400,,357,5.103448275862069
8696040,5,B00RW19EXO,"Perfection. Pure and simple. I love this movie so much. Beautifully acted, beautifully filmed, and a great script and concept.",1475712000,,126,5.35
8696041,4,B00RW19EXO,Pretty deep and entertaining. It kept my attention throughout the entire movie waiting to see how Walter would turn out in the end.,1469232000,,131,4.739130434782608
8696042,1,B00RW19EXO,"They borrowed William Macy's name for the movie.  He has all of 5 minutes total time on screen.
Cliche and predictable.  More like a film school graduate's first project.
And don't get me started on the main character's running around with stiff, unmoving arms that hang straight down - supposedly a sign of his mental state.",1466121600,,325,4.785714285714286
8696043,4,B00RW19EXO,"Since mumblecore films became popular (why?!  how?!), I've been suspicious of independent films, but Walter has soul (both the character and the film as a whole).  It's not in-your-face like most things released lately, and allows you to follow Walter around, wondering what's going to happen to the poor schmuck.  The ending is beautiful (no spoilers here).  Absolutely worth owning.",1463356800,,384,5.35
8696044,3,B00RW19EXO,"I thought this was really funny.  A very judgemental young man is feeling some guilt about harsh judging of his own father, and he seems to work it out as a kind of fable or parable.  It doesn't hand you a packaged story, you have to figure some of it out yourself.  I didn't pay too much attention to the religious Saint Peter imagery.",1450742400,,336,4.21875
