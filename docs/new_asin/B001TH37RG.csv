8341301,5,B001TH37RG,"THE GUNS OF NAVARONE have long been silent but the legend of this extraordinary and endearing film lingers on in our memory. They just don't make them like this any more. The script, the score (Dimitri Tiomkin), the cinematography, the actors and the characters they played are indelibly etched into the psyche. I often have fleeting thoughts of this film, happy ones, of the images, the words and the music from this WWII legend. The examination of camaraderie, the morality of killing and not killing, bravery, survival, betrayal, forgiveness and getting the job done are all integrated into a logical and emotional cohesive film that is both entertaining yet important in its representation of the extraordinary human qualities that can only be realized during war. THE GUNS OF NAVARONE is one of my favorite films and the less said the better. I just savor my memories of it and get a little warmth in my heart.

David Lean's BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is also another classic combining good stiff upper lip heroics and an overall cynicism of war and its futility as a means of expressing the humanity of all affected. This is a great film. It is interesting how William Holden's single handedness puts the entire essence of that statement to the test. William Holden and Alec Guinness are idealistically and diametrically opposed though not seen so visually in the same frame. Yet, Alec Guinness leaves an indelible image as the inimitable British Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa as the powerfully weak Colonel Saito with William Holden, the American and cynic looking in on the entire madness. William Holden's character and predicament almost seem secondary to the central plot, but ultimately the American falls into the madness. The true substance of the story lies in the conflict and irony between Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa and the morality of British soldiers building a bridge for the enemy to the best of their abilities as Holden, the American sees the entire lot of them playing toy soldier with real men's lives. The bridge is central to the plot and it takes on symbolic meaning as both a monument to British ingenuity and the inept weakness of their Japanese captors. Malcolm Arnold's score is most memorable for his use of Kenneth Alford's ""Colonel Bogey March."" This full is full of indelible sights and sounds. The unique look of the bridge structure over the River Kwai, the ""Colonel Bogey March"" and the scene where Alec Guinness falls on the plunger of the detonator box rigged to blow up the bridge have lived with me ever since I saw this film as a kid. That was a longtime ago, a time well remembered that only exists in my memory now. Adapted from Pierre Boulle's novel the screenplay (credited to Boulle) was written by the blacklisted Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, who received their Academy Awards, posthumously, in 1985.

FROM HERE TO ETERNITY is a classic in many respects combining old school filmmaking with a more realistic narrative and starkness of the 50's. I always thought Montgomery Clift's performance, as Private Prewitt is rather immortal and certainly a classic one. Clift is Prewitt. A lot of focus fell upon Frank Sinatra, but I thought his brilliance as an actor came just a few years after this. This is a film you really have to see and return to from time to time.",1398297600,,3332,4.854130052724077

8341303,4,B001TH37RG,"Haven't seen Guns of Navarone for many years and enjoyed it immensely. Never watched From Here to Eternity from beginning to end and it was outstanding, too.

Bridge on the River Kwai was another matter. Except for William Holden's performance I just can't recommend this one. Too long, too slow, too ambiguous.

Maybe it just needs a remake.",1307232000,,342,4.879310344827586
