399549,4,6301969014,"In GIRL CRAZY, Rooney and Garland finally grow up, despite the best intentions of a formula which saw them as kids on stage in film after film.  Judy plays Ginger Gray, the daughter of a college president.  The character Garland once described as ""Dorothy Adorable"", once given free rein in BABES ON BROADWAY (1941), BABES IN ARMS (1939) or the Andy Hardy movies, has, however, grown more complex.  Ginger Gray shows the contradictory and ironic charm of the latter Garland characters, both vulnerable and quick to laugh at herself in a way that the roles as ""Dorothy Adorable"" hardly suggest.  Berkeley films such as BABES IN ARMS & BABES ON BROADWAY  had used the familiar ""let's put a show on"" theme as a glorious excuse for Garland, Rooney and dozens of other chorus folk to concoct variety shows.  Although Norman Taurog's (he was Jackie Cooper's uncle) direction and staging of the musical numbers reflected the beginnings of a new style in film musicals, the plot of GIRL CRAZY  is completely conventional.  Not only are Rooney and Garland featured in virtually every scene, but they usually dominate the frame in Taurog's composition.  Tommy Dorsey's orchestra provides the swingy ambience and the musical score is outstanding: ""But Not for Me"", ""I Got Rhythm"" ""Embraceable You"" ""Fascinating Rhythm"" and ""Bidin' My Time"" along with 7 others!",958953600,4,1349,5.013452914798206
7818931,4,6301969014,"Put aside that Mickey Rooney, that juvenile dynamo, seems far-fetched as an irresistible New York playboy, dude plays one, anyway, in 1943's Girl Crazy. It's the ninth movie (of ten) to feature Rooney and Judy Garland, and, as per habit, they make an irrepressible duo. Rooney is Danny Churchill, Jr., a good time fella whose incessant carousing prompts his father, the publishing mogul, to dispatch him out west to a rugged all-boys' mining college so as to whip the callow out of him. Garland is Ginger Gray, the dean's grand-daughter and local postmistress. Ginger and Danny are right away at loggerheads. He's into her from jump, but she just doesn't like how brash and cocky he comes across. For that matter, the boys at the mining college don't care all that much for his strut and his braggadocio.

Hey, the mining college is in trouble, curb your surprise. See, a state legislature in conjunction with a new educational bill - ah, man, it's a bunch of red tape mumbo-jumbo. Essentially, the school will shut down next year due to a fatal shortage of enrollment applications. If only there were someone to put on a show to drum up business and save the school...

Norman Taurog directs most of the thing. Busby Berkeley directs the bombastic ""I Got Rhythm"" closing extravaganza and intended to direct the rest of the movie but was removed due to, uh, ""creative differences."" We're treated to Garland's flawless renditions of ""Bidin' My Time,"" Embraceable You,"" and that timeless lover's lament, ""But Not For Me."" The Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra perform their arrangement of Gershwin's ""Fascinatin' Rhythm,"" abetted marvelously by Rooney on the piano. June Allyson, early in her MGM stint, cameos in one early scene and shows off her pipes and stage swag with ""Treat Me Rough.""

I like Girl Crazy quite a bit, even though I like Babes in Arms (1939), Strike Up the Band (1940), and Babes on Broadway (1941) better. Rooney and Garland always muster up crazy charisma. They're simply entertaining together - his antics and boyish zest and constant mugging tempered by her winsomeness and her singing. Their natural chemistry is undeniable. Their brand of juvenile romance is potent. You're into them, whether they're bickering or conniving to stay the governor's hand from signing that bill to doom the college. By the end, I still haven't bought into Rooney as a mighty Casanova. But never mind. I played along and enjoyed the movie all the more for having caved to its wild postulation.",1470441600,,2495,4.907582938388626

7818933,5,6301969014,"I watched this on TCM today. It is a typical musical comedy film for the time. There is a musical number with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra where Mickey Rooney plays the piano. I didn't know he was so good. I am very impressed. Mickey appears with Judy Garland. He plays a girl crazy (hence the title I assume) son of a rich newspaper owner. He goes to far and daddy sends him to an all boys college. Judy is the dean's granddaughter and delivers the mail. They hear the news that the school will not be funded next year but Mickey comes up with a rodeo pageant idea that gets over 200 new apps for the next year and that saves the school. Mickey gets Judy and all live happy ever after I guess. A lot of very good songs and dance numbers in this one, also.",1376438400,,758,4.128378378378378
7818934,5,6301969014,These studios need to release these old musicals on DVD now! We want to enjoy them in all their glory and only remastered DVD will allow that!  With a sound track like this its a shame that its not on Dolby Re-Mastered Digital !!!,1146787200,4,230,4.2272727272727275
7818935,4,6301969014,"Girl Crazy is the story of a playboy Danny (Mickey Rooney) from New York whose father has had enough of his behavior. He is sent to an all boy's school out in the west where the boys get up promptly at 5:45, rarely shower, and find solace in riding horses all day. Danny certainly doesn't fit in, but he finds he can't complain too much thanks to the presence of Ginger (Judy Garland), the Dean's grand daughter and one of the prettiest girls he's ever seen. When the school is threatened to close, the two join up to find a way to save it.

Rooney is a barrell of fun in this film; his energy is contageous. He's hamming it up in every scene, especially in the ""I Got Rhythm"" finale. Although he isn't the most handsome of men, he really pulls off being a charming ladies' man, much like he was in life at this time. Garland is breathtakingly gorgeous throughout the film. Her natural charms, heartbreaking voice, and gentle sweetness add up for an amazing character and performance. June Allyson makes her first appearance in an opener that catches the attention quite well. She seems confident, but it is interesting to know that after each song she had to sing on a film, she threw up in the bathroom.

The songs in this film were later compiled for the musical Crazy For You. The lyrics were changed slightly to fit the altered plot, so if one is familiar with that show, it is interesting to see this film too.",1146787200,6,1416,4.421455938697318
7818936,4,6301969014,"at the pinnacle together, in their best & last musical. Judy stayed up there a little longer & Mickey started his decline. Plot? Irrelevant, except to say that Mickey Rooney's character was... girl crazy. It just took up the time between singing & dancing with Tommy Dorsey's band supplying the sound & the Gershwins the music & lyrics, some of their best remembered is in this movie. Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Tommy Dorsey, Ira & George Gershwin.

  But there's more!

  The finale!

  Busby Berkley's send up of ""I've Got Rhythm"". Truly who could ask for anything more? Judy Garland never looked so good again.",1136505600,2,615,4.836538461538462
7818937,5,6301969014,"This was not the first film version of this great George and Ira Gershwin musical, but it was the best.  It had been a huge hit on Broadway, with Ginger Rogers in the lead role (a fact nodded at by changing the female lead from Molly Gray to Ginger Gray).  It was the final and best of a half dozen or so musicals that Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney made together in a very short period of time.  It isn't that the production was so much more lavish than the previous films, but the blending of several absolutely stellar Gershwin songs with the combined talents of Judy, Mickey, and Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra.

We have to be honest here:  the plot is nothing to write home about, like a host of other musicals (until the late 1940s and early 1950s, the majority of film musicals were rather thin on plot).  The story, such as it is, is a frame upon which to hang songs, and luckily there are a host of songs.  This is not exactly the original songs as performed in the stage version of the show; some of the weaker numbers being replaced by stronger Gershwin numbers.  At worse, the numbers are highly entertaining, but a few of them completely transcend the typical productions in most of the Garland-Rooney MGM musicals.  Judy Garland had few moments in her career as splendid as when she sang ""But Not for Me,"" and almost the same thing could be said for ""Embraceable You.""  ""I Got Rhythm"" is one of the finest numbers that Judy and Mickey ever did together.  I am not a fan of the big bands ( I mean the swing bands, not jazz orchestras such as Duke Ellington's), but I make a bit of an exception for Tommy Dorsey, and the numbers his orchestra covers in this film show why.  ""Fascinatin' Rhythm"" features a marvelous arrangement, and gives wonderful moments for many of the wonderful soloists that filled his band.  My lone complaint is that Dorsey himself doesn't do as much playing as I would have liked.  Though he wasn't a great jazz innovator, his technique on trombone was simply amazing, and he managed to transform the instrument from a bleating horn to a subtle, beautiful, and lyrical instrument.

This film is also an important transition film in the careers of both Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney.  It was the last film that they would ever do together, after having starred together in a host of youth musicals in the previous few years.  It signaled the beginning of the decline of Rooney's career.  He would go on to make a huge number of films in his career, most of them rather minor parts, and he would from time to time score a very fine role, but from this point on his and Judy Garland's careers would be moving in opposite directions.  In their first film together, Rooney was the big star and Garland the newcomer, but immediately after this film Garland would be catapulted to stardom in a host of great MGM films throughout the 1940s.  But this also signaled the end of a period for Judy Garland.  She is so pure and innocent looking in this film that it almost breaks your heart.  It was essentially her last film as a teen (though she was 21 at the time).  Her next film would be MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, and it was during this film that people began giving her the drugs that would play such a large role in the rest of her life.  She would remain fresh and beautiful looking in her next several films such as THE CLOCK and THE HARVEY GIRLS, but eventually the strain would take its toll.  But not in GIRL CRAZY.  Her face is a marvel of innocence and loveliness.  I'm not sure she was ever more beautiful than in this one.",1098144000,24,3559,4.4104134762633995
7818938,5,6301969014,"I'm giving this film 5 stars based on one particular song in the film: ""Bidin' my time"". This performance by Judy just knocked my socks off when I caught it some time ago on late-night television. The rest of the film is fine too, but I'm a nut about music (all music from classical to rock) and after hearing this particular rendition I just had to own it. There's something different about how she and her group perform this song. I don't quite know how to describe it but it caught my interest immediately. It seems somehow ahead of its time. Anyway, that particular performance is just a joy to watch. I noticed that the commercial review had also picked up on this particular song.",1069977600,7,686,4.496
7818939,5,6301969014,"This is Mickey and Judy's best film together.  They play off each other wonderfully and Judy's laughter is infectious.  But it's the GREAT musical  score that makes ""Girl Crazy"" a movie to go crazy about.  This  was their last starring feature together (she went on to bigger things in  the years following) so get it, tuck it away and keep it for a rainy day  when you need a reminder of how talented this screen duo was.",965260800,5,422,4.402597402597403
7818940,5,6301969014,"This is not your typical Mickey / Judy film.  It has a Western Sitting and Judy gets to be independent in this film, not some love-lorn filly for Mickey Roney.",961027200,,159,4.3
