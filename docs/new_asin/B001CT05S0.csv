8289208,5,B001CT05S0,"I am temporarily living overseas and have to watch this program translated into another language.  Trust me when I tell you that the whole essence of the program is lost when it's not in English.  Some programs are watchable in another language but not this one.  So I bought the first three seasons and, oh, how refreshing.  Kyra Sedgwick is adorable in this role and I am really enjoying watching the shows in English. Amen.",1268438400,,426,4.64
8289209,5,B001CT05S0,"From the very first episode to the last of these seaons, The Closer is a great show. Season 1 introduces our characters, whom we grow to love and hate. Each episode and succeeding season builds on the one before it.
If you enjoy watching the series on televison as it is aired, I highly recommend purchased the series. When there is nothing on the air to watch, you'll always have these to choose from.",1267488000,,402,4.445945945945946

8289211,5,B001CT05S0,"My wife has enjoyed the Closer tv series, but missed the first season.  We enjoy the real life give and take of the characters in the series, especially how Kyra Sedgwick handles the underlying theme of sexism found the the earlier episodes.  A real winner in our book!",1232236800,2,269,4.583333333333333
