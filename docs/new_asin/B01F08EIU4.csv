wanna turn on Thumbbody to Canter?: this will work.
Likely I'll return to add notes here. Unconditional. Aim plz to put out more complete sets. With only audience sounds between tunes. ",1516406400,,429,4.876712328767123
8759896,5,B01F08EIU4,"This contains hours of excellent and insightful interviews along with concert footage from great bands such as The Wrong Object and The Muffins.

My only piece of constructive feedback for the filmmakers is that it's a bit of a buzzkill for there to be credits after every single song when you watch the concert footage. It's possible they may have to do that for some kind of legal reason (ugh), but it would be better for there to be credits after each band rather than each individual song.",1464825600,2,493,4.6022727272727275
