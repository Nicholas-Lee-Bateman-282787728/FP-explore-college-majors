7951462,3,B00005R1N7,"What most modern otaku might recognized as one of the anthropomorphized stars of Robot Girls, Magnos was a giant robot show from the mid-70s which has been put out on VHS and DVD in America several times. Usually as an episodic series titled Renegade Force, or Super Magnetron in Australia, but in the case of Liberty International as this compilation of the first few episodes of the TV series.

Sir Miles is a resourceful scientist who is convinced that recent disasters plaguing the world are being caused by aliens. The United Nations say he's crazy for thinking that, and refuse to support his theory. So, Sir Miles sets out with his daughter Lady Ester to recruit a karate champ Janus to join their super robot crew and fight the oncoming invasion. The aliens use grotesque giant animal hybrids to attack major cities, which our heroes fight off with their dual mechas, Magnon and Magenta. When the heat turns up though, they ditch their more Gobot looking mecha for the mighty Magnos, which uses the other two robots as laser guns, and occasionally as huge drill bits to completely screw over the attacking kaiju. The feature ends with the aliens failing to stop the Magnos team, and their alien overlord seemingly destroying his lackeys, vowing to continue their invasion.

Magnos The Robot is definitely one of the strangest of the 70s super robots, especially with its totally impractical habit of shifting the pilots from one mecha/vehicle to the other, instead of combining them like Mazinger Z or Getter Robo. It's worth a look though to get the totally trippy action that you could only get from Bronze Age sci-fi action shows!",1474761600,,1641,4.857142857142857
7951463,4,B00005R1N7,"I remember this movie...years ago. Like when I was five. At that magical time of childhood where you didn't know what the hell some of your cartoons were saying because you didn't understand things like vocabulary, editing, tension, drama. AND PLOT! You are just amazed at the fact that there were giant robots fighting every five minutes for nearly an hour and a half.

Well, now I am older and wiser. Now I realize that there is such a thing as Chop Shop imports. What are Chop Chop imports? Well long time ago, if you remember Force Five or Space Thunder Kids. Before you could get translators or even afford risking money on an odd show from over seas that maybe not a lot of kids are going to get. They just took an entire series of a japan cartoon show and chopped it up so that what you got was an abbreviated version. Where they tried to make a movie out of bits and pieces of an entire show. This has left this movie awkwardly rushing through drama and set pieces. Plot points come and go constantly, And the plot is so poorly reconstructed that it doesn't even give enough time for character development. Just action and dialogue that you don't care about.

Why did I give this a four star rating? Well Now that I know what it is. What the plot is. And what editing and drama is. This is obviously a hilarious attempt at a producing company that ultimately didn't give a single half s*** about what the original content was. They probably didn't do too much research as to what the original show was. So we have plot points the drag on with moments of bizarre action or attempts to resolve tension. There is even a point in the movie where there is complete silence as the robot tries to drill a hole into the hip of a tyrannosaurs chicken while riding on wheels that jut out on either side of it's knees. And this is the big second act fight.

Every moment brought a tear to my eye and I couldn't stop laughing. I would have given a five star rating based on the humor I got from it on my own. But I think the fact that it is crap prevents me from enjoying it completely. An obviously it has a three star boost from just nostalgia alone. So all in all This would be utter crap to anyone else, but it has that special place in my heart.",1389052800,2,2246,4.267605633802817

Or, will Magnos triumph over the evil forces and protect Earth's freedom against future invaders? As suspense mounts, you'll discover what happens in this exciting adventure of humans and machines, good versus evil!

Well that really is the whole plot. So I won't recap that. The anime itself is late 70's, so the quality is not the greatest. However, the DVD transfer does nothing in the way of trying to improve the quality. Constant jumps in picture and black lines running vertically from top to bottom, greatly reduce the enjoyment of this classic. It has to be the worst quality anime I have ever seen: I feel like I am watching a VHS version that was made twenty years ago. The sound doesn't fair any better. The music, which is definitely ghetto, is at many times in the movie louder than the voices of the characters, drowning them out entirely. But if by some miracle you can look past all that, take a chance, the story is definitely a classic.

Not rated becuase there is nothing but good ole classic anime.",1062374400,2,1601,4.751798561151079
