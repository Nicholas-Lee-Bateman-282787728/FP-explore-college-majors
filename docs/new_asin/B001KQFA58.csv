Her husband has to stop sunny from breaking up his marriage and reclaim his love for his wife. The scenery and city life in Bangkok, Thailand is beautiful and so is the song kaho na kaho ,yeh ankhein bolti hain, o sanam ,o sanam ,o meri sanam which means (whether you say it or not ,your eyes say it all my love) and Zindagi Iss tarah Se, which is a sad song about when Sudhir discovers his beautiful wife is unfaithful to him and is very shocked and saddened by it. In the end Simran becomes a loyal and faithful wife and their marriage is strong and a rewarding experience. Murder is a really good movie and cautionary film to watch.",1327104000,4,978,4.594285714285714
