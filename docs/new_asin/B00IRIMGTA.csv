6289583,3,B00IRIMGTA,"I give this series a 3 not because it is bad but I guess Chicago is just a rough place and the people a little crude.  There is no comparison to law and order.  I did not like this series.  It's just not good.  Once again you have a writer trying to race bate and I guess the writers just did not do their homework.  I will not buy a other series.  If the first, to me is bad, they only go down from the first one.  This has no where else to go. The human body has 10 pints of blood however in this series  the ones that failed to do the research by the overuse of pseudo blood and busted noses/faces would have you believe all 10 pints are located in the face.  The whole series seems to put mor emphasis on how much fake situations/ fake blood they can film than any good or fair storyline .  The whole series sucks through and through!",1410048000,,838,3.964071856287425
6289584,5,B00IRIMGTA,I just recently watched Chicago pd and I love it! I am definitely someone who likes to see justice served and this show gives just that if not more! This is a great tv series looking forward to season 2!,1409961600,7,203,4.1

6289586,5,B00IRIMGTA,"This is among the best of the ""Cop"" shows.  I have never lived in Chicago but if we can believe what we read so
realistic.  The acting is stellar and the stories well written.  So glad it was picked up for another season.",1407715200,4,221,4.093023255813954
6289587,5,B00IRIMGTA,"Being a lover of Chicago dispite living in NYC for 47 years, I gobble up any films and/or TV series that are set in Chi and NYC.  I
love CASTLE, CSI NY, CHICAGO FIRE and this extraordinary show.  Note that the chief star of District 21 was a friend of Detective
Beckett on Castle; got murdered and led to an interesting episode in LA.  Anyhow, I think he is outstanding here, though one has to
watch the show closely because there are a lot of different things happening and flipping channels even momentarily can cause you
to get confused.  The whole cast is excellent, the photography superb and the acting on the money.  I did not think Chicago PD
permitted shows about them (none on FOX'S Cops series) though there have been Chi cops on ""BAIT CAR"" programs.  I think the
Chicago PD gets a bad rap at times but overall my impression of them living in Chicago in the 1960s was very good.  And they have
great looking badges along with the LAPD badges.  NYPD are ok.
  The stories are very good, keep your attention and have some mush if you like that (I do) and some tear jerking parts as well.
The setting appears to be on the near SW side of Chicago but I did not know that they call their stations ""districts"".  I thought they
used the term ""precinct"" like here in NYC.  The CPD is the second largest police department in the USA.  The producers must
like the Sears Tower (phooey on the Willis name!) and the ""L"" because they are always showing those Chicago Landmarks.  I
mean the L to Chicago is like the Empire State Building to NY.  Note:  The Sears tower roof is about 83 feet higher than the
Freedom Tower's  roof. so Technically the Sears is taller: no ""spires"" here.
  I also subscribe to CHICAGO FIRE and have ordered the DVDs when they are available (from AMAZON, of course) but prior
to that I get the episodes on my Video Libraries.  If you like gritty, realistic crime fighting and terrific story telling (and hot ladies!)
watch this series.  I love it!!",1400716800,14,1972,4.4222222222222225
6289588,5,B00IRIMGTA,"First introduced in Chicago Fire as a dirty cop bent on destroying Lt. Matthew Casey's (Jesse Spencer) life, Sgt. Hank Voight (Jason Beghe) is back at District 21. For reasons unclear to even their chief, Voight has made arrangements with mysterious high-powered persons, releasing him from prison in order to head an Intelligence Unit that is meant to capture some of Chicago's biggest criminals.

On Voight's team of detectives are Alvin Olinsky (Elias Koteas), a veteran who goes back to the old days with Voight; Antonio Dawson (Jon Seda), a good cop first introduced as paramedic Gabby Dawson's brother on Chicago Fire; Jay Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer), a former Army Ranger who has trouble deciding if Voight is a man to emulate or fear; Adam Ruzek (Patrick John Flueger), a recent police academy recruit whose overzealousness for the work often gets him into trouble with Olinsky; and Erin Lindsay (Sophia Bush), a mysterious young woman who clearly shares a personal relationship with Voight, although it's anyone's guess as to what kind or why.

Rounding out the cast are computer whiz Sheldon Jin (Archie Kao); sarcastic desk Sgt. Platt (Amy Morton); and rookie street cops Kevin Atwater (LaRoyce Hawkins) and Kim Burgess (Marina Squerciati).

While the series focuses - of course - on fighting crime, particularly the types of deep-rooted crimes that require undercover to derail, such as drug dens, serial killers and rapists, and counterfeit, it isn't all dark and depressing. The trio of Platt, Atwater and Burgess is always guaranteed to provide a few moments of levity, as the veteran sergeant attempts to test the rookies. There's a crackle of attraction between Halstead and Lindsay, despite Voight's warnings that he'll destroy them both if he finds the tiniest action on either of their parts. Also, there is the raw sweetness between Lindsay and Voight - generally only when they are sure no one else is around to witness - which reveals, layer by layer, episode by episode, just how much the two care for one another and just what Lindsay meant in the pilot when she fervently told a co-worker that the older man had ""saved her life"" when she was a teenager.

Sure, there are numerous police dramas out there, many of which may be good, many of which may be formulaic. This one is definitely one of the good ones! Give it a chance - an episode or two, and you'll soon be hooked!",1397174400,36,2399,4.886977886977887

6289632,5,B00IRIMGTA,"Law & Order creator Dick Wolf, made his Chicago series because he wanted to give viewers a separate look at the heroes who make a city run, but beyond that, he wanted to make it as realistic as possible. These shows feel a lot like one of my favorite all-time TV shows, Third Watch, but in that case they were all together in one show. Chicago P.D. focuses on major crimes detectives and shows that unlike Law & Order, the police aren't above reproach and always in control.

The unit is run by Hank Voight (Jason Beghe), who while having a soft spot for victims, also runs on pure emotion. If Voight can't get the bad guy legally, he'll get them another way. He's also not the most honest cop around and has a checkered past filled with abuses of power, as seen in his debut on Chicago Fire.

Voight's unit includes his best friend and uncover specialist Alvin Olinsky (Elias Koteas), who is more honest than Voight, but always has his back. Olinsky is a master of disguise, and is in charge of training a rookie and possibly his eventual replacement played by Patrick Flueger. Also joining Voight is Erin Lindsey (Sophia Bush) a runaway that Voight rescued and raised as his own, who is partnered with another hot head, who while reminding her of Voight, also has romantic feelings for her.  Finally rounding out the squad is Antonio Dawson (Jon Seda), the brother of a paramedic on Chicago Fire and the man who originally tried to put Voight in jail. He's one of Voight's best detectives, but can he be trusted?

As you can see from the character descriptions, threes a lot going on here, not to mention a uniform patrol division we see on a semi-regular basis. The show isn't narrowly focused on particular types of crimes and frequently has crossover with both the other Chicago shows and Law & Order SVU.

The Bottom Line, Chicago P.D. hits the bulls eye as the most realistic cop drama since Southland. They dive deeply into the characters background, families, and personalities, it's a lot of fun to watch. The way they go about doing their job is unlike any other cop show on TV and the whole Third Watch feel to the way it's filmed has me in cop heaven. I can not wait for this show to stream so I can binge away!",1488844800,,2224,4.481481481481482

I have watched quite a few police dramas but there is just something about Chicago PD... It has the total package, great writing, great acting and an amazing cast with the best chemistry I have ever seen on a TV series... The stories seem like they could come from real life, like the writers really do their homework and work to keep things as close to the real thing as possible... The characters are so well developed... Very multi-dimensional and well rounded characters that are very easy to relate to... Dick Wolf and his crew are very special people with a great talent for great television!",1451606400,3,766,4.639705882352941

6289698,5,B00IRIMGTA,"Chicago P.D. is one of the best cops shows in the last 15 years
It has elements from Homicide: Life on the Streets and The Closer/Major Crimes
with the look and feel of The Law and Order
It's very dark and realistic but, it never once goes over the top to the point of no return
It's paints the proper picture of cops in a major city trying to protect the people of there city!

Cast is strong (one of the best cast in terms of any police drama)
Jason Beghe  as  Hank Voight is what  Vic Mackey from the Shield should have been
Hank isn't clean by any means but, he does have a deep moral ground he's human not a stereotypical crooked cop!
Jon Seda  as  Detective Antonio Dawson  (It's good to see Jon playing a layered character he was good in Homicide: Life on the Streets but, he's grown and is a solid rock star on Chicago P.D.)
Elias Koteas  as  Detective Alvin Olinsky (Elias is freaking awesome in whatever he does he was Casey Jones in the original TMNT film it's cool to see him as this detective that's been through the mill and still tries to be his best!
Sophia Bush  as  Erin Lindsay  (A once bad girl that Hank took in and raised as his own daughter  Erin is very much Hank's daughter she has his drive and passion to be a good cop

Jesse Lee Soffer  as  Jay Halstead  (I mostly know his previous work in Mob Doctor and Lifetime's Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret tv movie he can act it's good to see him get a big break like this!

Patrick John Flueger  as  Adam Ruzek (most people who were fan's of USA's 4400 will know him)
Marina Squerciati  as  beat-cop Kim Burgess (I can see why she was cast she has those big Bambi eyes you are walking into this series with Kim being your point of view it helps she is a solid actress all around!
Laroyce Hawkins  as beat-cop Kevin Atwater  (Kim's partner)
Amy Morton as desk sergeant Trudy Platt  (Amy is really a amazing talent she's a hometown Chicago actress that should've broke out more and been more of a house hold name imo) she gets better with every episode
Stella Maeve  as  Nadia Decotis  (Erin's drug addict friend who wants to change and be better and she does anyone who watches C.P.D. loves Nadia for all the right reasons

If you love series like Law and Order, L&O: C.I. , Homicide: Life on the Streets, Major Crimes it's on the same amazing level
Dick Wolf has the golden touch and knows how to write series about a profession that really gets no respect mostly due to News outlets
Great Series all around 5 Star Cast, super HQ action scenes, perfect writing there's a reason Chicago P.D. has already been renewed for a fourth season!  One of the Best NBC's exclusives  10/10",1447804800,7,2649,4.301619433198381

6289720,4,B00IRIMGTA,"I mostly agree with Joanna M's review of this show from 4/11/14, but I do have a few thoughts of my own to add to the mix.
Season 1 of Chicago PD is an enjoyable and entertaining show, though I do not feel it is an excellent show.  However, I am interested in picking up Season Two once its available (which I believe it will be later this year!)  It is hard to come up with a truly original cop show concept in the wake of nearly 80yrs of American cop show history. One of the remaining distinguishing features of this genre is the geographical flavor, and Chicago PD does give viewers SOME of that. Most of the cases and most of the plots are fairly standard. But the action sequences are very well-done, and the character development is engaging enough that I do find myself caring about the characters.

What I perceive as the shows shortcomings are minor: The shows main protagonist, Sgt. Voight, seems to confound and/or deflect constant IA probes pretty easily, sometimes to the point of implausibility. I can accept that Voight, despite his dirty rep, still has enough pull to get things done within the department, but its hard to accept that he manages to keep a garage or storage room or basement roomor whatever it isall to himself for beating the crap out of suspects/criminals.  However, neither of these issues subtracts from the overall storytelling.

My last two issues are strictly personal opinions as a native Chicagoan: I notice that five or six of the eps in Season 1 show police actions or stake-outs that take place in or around Chicagos Cermak Warehouse district, including one ep that shows action happening in Chinatown. I get that its a convenient area in which to film, as traffic tends to be lighter and, thus, easier to reroute for purposes of filming. The venue also makes it possible to catch decent vantage shots of the downtown area as well as the southwestern branch of the Chicago River. Its not a big deal, but the repetition from episode to episode did make me want to see other areas of Chicago. After all, its a very big city with a lot of photogenic venues. IE one visually-striking episode takes place along Chicagos Riverwalk and culminates at Navy Pier.  Im not saying the show should be filmed around tourist traps (which are probably more expensive to shoot in), just saying that theres plenty more of the city, north, south and west, to explore.

My last issue, also a personal opinion, Id like Chicago politics to play a slightly bigger role. Not saying the show should follow in the footsteps of Kelsey Grammers BOSS, but I think it would be reasonable that some of the police actions depicted could have political ramifications of some sort

But overall, I do like this show and will certainly be interested in seeing the second season once its released. If you're a fan of cop shows, or if you're a fan of anything filmed in Chicago, this DVD is a worthwhile investment. Though not excellent, it is certainly entertaining.",1435536000,,2974,4.662213740458015

6289795,5,B00IRIMGTA,"I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois and I absolutely love this show! Crime happens in every city, but there isn't a Detective Voight in every city. I think the cast brings so much to the table and there is so much chemistry. There are moments with suspense, drama and even some comedic relief, like Halstead's complaints on feeling like a house husband because Lindsay always gets to drive. My family and I are moving back to Chicago soon, and I can't wait. This show is filmed right in the city, and it's sister show Chicago Fire is also filmed in Chicago. It definitely makes Chicago a huge tourist destination, and with it being a tourist destination, there is money to be made. So I think this show is actually good for the Chicago economy.
