7847451,3,6303453996,"Kind of a snoozy, disjointed comedy in which Bing Crosby plays a 1930s rodeo rider who ropes a society gal, and settles down in the wild West.  Crosby's young and cute, but the film's plot is entirely deficient, and almost seems to have been made up on the fly. Look quick for a young Roy Rogers playing in the background during the big hoedown at the end; Martha Raye also debuts here as her typical man-hungry old maid. (Animal acting notes:  check out the expression of the white horse Bing rides during a music number at the start -- hilarious!  The bull he buys, named Cuddles, is kinda cute too.)",1063065600,,602,4.454545454545454
7847452,4,6303453996,"Jeff Larabee (Bing Crosby)is a one track mind cowboy (mind stuck on his prize bull ""Cuddles"") until he meets up with the lovely Doris whom he knows as ""Lois"" (Frances Farmer). Classic story of mistaken identity, falling in love, and of course the happy ending.  A fun, lighthearted film that will leave you smiling.",1003017600,,315,4.833333333333333
7847453,4,6303453996,"Perhaps no other star ever looked more uncomfortable on horseback than Bing Crosby does here. Frances Farmer is lovely but shows a surprising lack  of chemistry with Bing. But it's Martha Raye, making her feature film  debut, who steals every scene she's in. Director Taurog signed her up after  seeing her perform in a Hollywood nightclub during production. As with most  musical comedies of the 1930s, forget about plot and just sit back and  enjoy the performances. Look for a very young Roy Rogers as the cast enjoys  a sing-along to Johnny Mercer's ""I'm an Old Cowhand."" Crosby,  Raye, and Burns would team again in ""Waikiki Wedding."" Raye  introduces the Sam Coslow tune that became her theme song, ""Mr.  Paganini/You'll Have to Swing It,"" and gets to do her classic drunk  bit.",967680000,4,784,4.871212121212121
