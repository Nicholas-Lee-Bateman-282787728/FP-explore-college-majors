8683483,5,B00OGQA5OU,Bought this DVD while it was on sale. My kids went trick-or-treating and then watched the DVD as they ate way more candy then they should have! They loved the halloween (but not scary) cartoons. That and the ability to color the cover was great. Recommended 100%,1417305600,,262,4.595744680851064
