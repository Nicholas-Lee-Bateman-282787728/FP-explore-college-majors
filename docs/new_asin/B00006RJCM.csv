1789213,3,B00006RJCM,"This wonderful dvd is great on my little computer but is unreadable on our expensive dvd/vcr player in our living room! Of course, that is where we had hoped to be able to enjoy it! Any ideas?",1159401600,4,192,4.216216216216216
1789214,5,B00006RJCM,This is a great Dvd. The fire is beautiful and relaxing. We are still enjoying it without the Christmas Caroles. Very satisfied with product.,1140652800,2,141,4.916666666666667
1789215,5,B00006RJCM,"Based on previous reviews, I purchased The Happy Holiday Hearth DVD and it was great. The music and singing is great!!! Plus the fire is very realistic and I recommend this DVD. One of the best things about the DVD is that there are 3 options to choose: fire; fire + music and fire + music + fire crackling. This was worth every penny.",1136160000,20,335,4.25
1789216,5,B00006RJCM,This DVD is almost as good as a real fireplace.  Great selection of Christmas songs or you can play it with just the crackeling fire sound.  Everyone who has seen it loves it.  One of the best buys I've ever made.,1134259200,8,213,4.146341463414634
1789217,5,B00006RJCM,"I have to echo what all of the other reviewers have said; this is a fantastic D.V.D!  I live in the U.K. and fireplace videos seem to be a rare and elusive thing over here.  I purchased one of these for myself and one for a friend who has a multi-region DVD player and after watching mine today, I'm sure he will love his!  I played it with the Christmas music and crackling both on, but turned down low and I felt so cozy and relaxed, I drifted off!!  Even my Mum who hates Christmas had to admit that it was lovely and the carol arrangements are very beautiful.  I can't recommend this highly enough.  Turn off the lights, gather round the T.V. and dream yourself the perfect Christmas.",1102809600,34,688,4.294573643410852
1789218,5,B00006RJCM,"I love this DVD. It is so cute. The music is nice and soothing, nothing to loud and crazy. I play it at on the kids tv while they take a nap. It's going to be great playing in the background at our Christmas paryt this year.",1089244800,13,224,3.7872340425531914
1789219,5,B00006RJCM,"This DVD is *just* what we hoped it would be! You have a choice of crackling fire with no music, crackling fire with holiday music, or silent fire with holiday music.  Of course, if you turn down the volume, you'd have fire with no crackling or music.  The music is a choir that sings in Ray Coniff Singers-style.

The only thing on which I can comment is that the very tops of the flames are not visible on the screen.  However, the fire is roaring and bright enough to cast a fire-like glow on the floor in front of the TV.  We have enjoyed this very much and have set our DVD player to repeat for hours of uninterrupted playtime.

Great price, great DVD.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1072137600,89,678,4.333333333333333
1789220,3,B00006RJCM,"As fireplace videos go, this one is not bad. Better than some much more expensive ones. The editors let you watch the fire for a good long relaxing time,  but you don't get the whole life of the fire experience of watching it die down to embers.",1042588800,5,245,4.212765957446808
1789221,3,B00006RJCM,"If you remember the Christmas music your parents listened to in the 60's with your generic choir, this is what the music is like.  I didn't mind that, but I did mind that there are not ""tracks"" on this DVD and you cannot skip a song.  By the 5th or 6th song in, you can forget it's on.  Crackles are a little far between.  Fireplace background could have been nicer.  Conversation piece nonetheless.",1038009600,6,399,4.410958904109589

1789233,4,B00006RJCM,"Bought this for a holiday party at work. People kept telling me ""It feels as warm as a real fire!"" (of course it did, the coffee urns were on a table right in front of the TV it was playing on!). The picture is great, but the music is a little bit lackluster, so I supplied a different soundtrack for the party.",1492560000,,311,4.032258064516129

1789235,5,B00006RJCM,Awesome!!!:) This is an Awesome Relaxing Christmas Music Video with the fireplace crackling when the music is playing. I've listened to this more then once on rainy and cold days because at home with my heater on and this playing it makes me feel relaxed.

1789274,5,B00006RJCM,"I have many fireplace DVDs, the picture is quite good, I had lines in it but when I chose (deinterlace) option, the picture was great again.
What sets this one apart is that the songs are vocals instead of instrumentals; I love the selections (23 classic Christmas songs) and
the vocal renditions, from traditional choral singing (like old style Ray Conniff like another reviewer noticed), non stop renditions that make for enjoyable variety;.
as usual, you can choose natural wood burning sounds or Christmas music or both. It's only one hour long but it loops indefinitely.

The only criticism is that the fire doesn't progress enough; it should burn out gradually like a real fireplace, but for the price, it's an interesting addition to my growing collection. Recommended!",1478649600,,776,5.0625
1789275,4,B00006RJCM,"Got it for Company Christmas Party - the private room had a TV w/DVD player - looked really neat in the room and the music was good too

I play it with just the crackling fire sound, no music. Nice fire & sound, it's relaxing & inviting. It makes me think of people sitting around the fire & enjoying it. Nice for winter & the holidays. My first copy stopped working, so I've ordered another one. Good price, & worth it. I think it's a Prime item, too. I recommend this DVD!",1460937600,2,465,4.295454545454546
1789278,5,B00006RJCM,"Since 2006, this DVD has become a tradition during our Christmas holiday. Searching for something to add a little peace & calm during the overly excited children, I took a chance on this DVD. The whole family enjoys listening to the music & watching the fireplace while exchanging gifts. Option available to select a lifelike crackling sound of the fireplace or not. The fireplace provides an added bonus by adding an extra seasonal touch in photos. About an hour long, this is one of the best DVDs for background ambience capturing the spirit of Christmas. The familiar carols are relaxing for adults while kids open gifts & the chidren will even sing along to their favorite songs though the music is all instrumental. My now grown son has asked where he can find this so he can enjoy the tradition in his home. Highly recommend this DVD.",1460937600,5,840,4.72108843537415

1789280,5,B00006RJCM,"We had our neighborhood white elephant gift exchange at our home this Christmas and needed to fit 25 people in our living room, which would require some to sit in front of the fireplace. I was bummed we wouldn't be able to use our fireplace for ambiance, and was also thinking that we should have something up on our huge flat screen next to the fireplace, so this was the perfect solution! It was a great price so I thought, why not?!
Little did I know, it would be a hit! Everyone was either cracking up or totally impressed! Either way, everyone wanted to know where I got it (Amazon Prime...duh!).
It was also a bonus that you could choose if you just wanted the crackling fire (which I opted with my own music), or selecting for it to play w the included music. The music offered on the DVD was not quite my style (it was more old-shook Classic Christmas music) but it was still enjoyable.",1456531200,,894,4.359281437125748

1789298,5,B00006RJCM,"This is a really nice addition to the Christmas festivities. It really does add a lot of ambiance. At first I thought it might be a little cheesy, but it really turned out to be a nice addition. We also used those pinion pine incense from Incensio De Sante Fe. The incense gives off a real wood smell and combined with the dvd it really felt like a real fireplace going and set the mood.

As far as the music, I really happened to like it because it reminds me of Holiday music playing at department stores, while scrambling around shopping. I enjoy the memories....I can see where others may find that type of music annoying. I did however have the option of just turning on the cd player and listen to other types of Holiday music while having  only the fire crackle play on the video.",1452297600,,787,4.346938775510204

1789302,5,B00006RJCM,"OK, yes, they are a bit corny, but...I sent about ten of these out in place of Christmas cards this year (and I let Amazon do the delivering for me) to close friends and everyone seems to really like them. My parents used to watch the Yule fireplaces on TV every year and I used to tease them since there was a huge *real* fireplace just across the room from the couch, but my father would say, ""Be quiet you, I don't have to haul firewood for this!""

I have a pretty big TV in my bedroom and this winter here in cold Connecticut, I look forward to laying in bed late at night and reading with a roaring fireplace (crackling sounds and all) warming up the room. By the way, yes, you can turn off the Christmas music and just listen to the sounds of a fire. How nice is that?

Now, I'm a big fan of streaming, and by and large, I prefer streaming to putting on a DVD, but the yule logs available on streaming are just inferior to the Happy Holiday Hearth. Also, I was given a massive kit DVD Yule Log with song books that was all cutesy and it's awful comparatively.

1789322,5,B00006RJCM,"Pros: looks real, choice of music and/or crackling, actual fire video nothing more, classic homey songs,

Cons: Only one view of fireplace/fire (could be con to some)

I purchased this for my family's first Christmas in our new home. We were without a working fireplace and I wanted to make sure the classic Christmas feeling stayed with us, even if we were someplace new.  During my childhood, and my son's, Christmas morning had a roaring fire and holiday music playing while we opened presents and ate breakfast. The thought of that ending saddened me, so I went looking for a replacement.

I saw a lot of DVD's that had different fireplace styles, different views, moved around the fireplace, featured small fires, or had weird ""additions"" to the fireplace scene. I even saw a few that had campfires instead of a fireplace. I just wanted a roaring fire with crackling sound, and this was it.

It absolutely feels like you are sitting in front of a fireplace (minus the welcoming heat). The crackling sound is comforting and very realistic, and the music option is without a doubt the perfect background selection for Christmas morning (a wonderful option for hot cocoa on Christmas-Eve night, too!).

Overall, if you are looking for a realistic, roaring fire to use on Christmas (or anytime actually) this is the DVD you are looking for. With or without the music you will find it a welcome replacement when you don't (or can't) have the real thing.",1435536000,,1453,4.815261044176707

1789352,5,B00006RJCM,"I bought 5 of these this holiday season.  Two went to friends who thought the ""fire"" was fabulous when they saw it.  I'm saving one for back up and have others for friends who see it and want to know where it came from.  We're still using it into January.  Since we live in Tucson, Arizona it's rarely cool enough for a fire, but we have one every night now.  We actually put a flat screen TV in the fireplace with a small DVD player and with the screen drawn, it looks and sounds like a fire is burning.  It was a huge hit at a Christmas party we hosted.  Guests were able to sit on the raised hearth with no concern of overheating!  The popping and crackling sounds are so real that on a few cold days I had it going from 8 am to bedtime.  It actually makes you feel warmer because of the visual and sound in the room.  We jokingly say we're too hot because of the fire. Because it runs continuously, you turn it on and forget it.  There's no overprint or anything to indicate it's a DVD once you start it (which takes only a few seconds).  If you have a fireplace or just want the ambiance of a fire, this DVD is a steal at the price and you won't be disappointed!",1422316800,5,1167,4.048034934497816

One disappointment was that it was shot in 4:3, so it doesn't take up the whole screen on a modern television. I did appreciate having the option for a fireplace with or without music, but the music also felt a bit dated. The fire itself is not bad. It's filmed slightly off center, which might annoy viewers who focus on details. Overall, a fairly average production from over 12 years ago.",1411084800,,470,4.413793103448276

As others have mentioned, the picture is framed too closely on the fireplace, but the audio is so enjoyable that we don't really care.  For the audio portion, you can select holiday music only, or crackling fire only, or music & fire together, so there is a lot of variety available for ways in which to enjoy this CD.",1390176000,,520,4.5
1789434,3,B00006RJCM,"visually this was a big disappointment overall.  First of all it's in letterbox format which wasn't disclosed at the time of purchase.  That means I've got the immensely annoying black bars on either side of the screen.  The image is low res with the contrast being way too high.  Also, the fire itself seems to be burning in fast foward mode.  Either that or it was lit with an accelerant.  The only reason I gave it three stars was the music that can accompny the fire.  That part I liked very much.  I've seen other fireplace videos and frankly, I don't see why it's so hard to properly frame a fireplace.  It's not rocket science people!!!  Just make sure the whole fire is in view, no negative space underneath and for god sake don't move the camera mid way through the fire.  The only other thing I liked about this one was when it came to the end of the loop, instead of blacking out and beginning again (which is very jarring)it cross dissolved to a close up of the flame itself then cross dissolved back the the beginning of the loop.  I found this to be a much smoother transition.
Bottom line, if you still have one of those old square analogue TVs this might be a good buy, but if you have a flat screen TV keep searching for fireplace DVD's, preferably in blu ray.",1389830400,,1277,4.341772151898734

1789477,4,B00006RJCM,"This DVD completely fills my 42"" screen with a video of a fire that has been recently been started but is now well burning. Since the wood never burns down this is obviously a loop, but I've stared at it for a long time and can't spot it. I'm also totally satisfied with the picture quality; this is an abstract subject, and blue ray quality simply isn't required. The fire sounds are subtle and pleasant. I'm particular about music, and guessing that I wouldn't like what is on the disk I have no intention of even sampling it.

I do have one complaint. Instead of seeing the typical split logs of an established fire, what you primarily see are smallish round branches stacked in a tepee fashion, more like a campfire. It's the type of wood you might use to get a fire started. However, the fire is still completely realistic, and I'm sticking with 5 stars.",1355788800,,859,4.471337579617835

They don't sound totally realistic, but they add just the right amount of cheese factor. I did not buy this with the intention of listening to the music. Instead, we put it on our TV, turned the crackle effects up, and played our own music during our holiday party. That said, I cant attest to the music sound or how good it is.

1789521,1,B00006RJCM,"Dislikes:
1) The image of the fire is too close up so you cannot see the top of the flames. This doesn't sound like a big deal but it is because the optical illusion of turning your TV into a fireplace is spoiled by this. It doesn't look real or convincing.
2) The video is on a loop so the fire never changes -- it doesn't flare up and then die down -- it just roars away like a gas log set turned up high. I was hoping for something more like a traditional real fire that would have more variation.
3) The flames are too bright for the camera causing a kind of burnout on screen, which is hard on the eyes. It's a pity it wasn't better filmed.
4) The fireplace itself is boring and not cosy.

The option of having just the crackling fire, music or both is a nice option. My wife and I enjoy the music, it is a bit dated (Ray Conniff style) but we are in our early 50's.

The students and other library patrons commented that it made them feel cozy and relaxed.  The picture quality is excellent, and the crackling fire audio is realistic.

I found the first couple of songs pleasant, but, for me personally, I like the instrumental version more than the constant singing with nostalgic songs.

I'd gone to 7 different stores during the holiday madness, and finally threw in the towel, and went online. Did a general search on ""virtual fireplace"" and found the Happy Holiday Hearth on Amazon. I read the reviews, not just for this DVD, but for others. I decided this one had what I was looking for. I ordered it, and got it even sooner than Amazon had estimated I would.
I'm now addicted to this DVD. Every night, I put my daughter to bed (she's 11), turn on the ""fire"" and she drifts off to sleep, while I sit in a chair, staring at it. You can choose 3 options: crackling fire, which is what we choose, holiday music, and crackling fire with holiday music. The holiday music is a bit old school, bombastic, earnest choir singing. Not relaxing. But the fire all by itself is so relaxing. The crackles are not incessant, but sprinkled throughout, adding a nice touch. The fire itself is amazing...I wonder what kind of firewood was used, because the logs take forever to burn. You never see the fire start to peter out. It's just a lovely blaze. No background sounds, like people talking as I've found in a previous hearth video (bought years ago.) I swear, I feel warm when I watch it. It's on a continuous play command, so all night, all day, as long as you want, you have this fire that is a thing of beauty to watch.  When my daughter has sleepovers, at a certain point, I put the Holiday Hearth DVD in, and pretty soon, all the chatterboxes are slumbering away.",1295049600,,1543,4.357638888888889

It is really good quality and has three different setting one for music only one for crackling only and the last with both features and of course the awesome fireplace that you see. It runs on a loop(it runs over and over if you want)and is nice to have not only for the holidays but any day any time of year you want to view a lovely fireplace.

1789612,4,B00006RJCM,This DVD is great.  I didn't have a fire place but I wanted the look of a fireplace and sound of it for the holidays.  I love the sounds and the music.  You can play only the crackling fire sound or with music.  Its great for the hoildays if you don't have a fire place.  I really loved it and my friends loved it and purchased their own.,1281484800,,338,3.911764705882353

Even after the holidays it is a wonderful way to relax, just play it with out the singing and you can use it anytime of the year.  My husband and I watch it when we want to destress, my grandchildren think it is the coolest thing to see on tv and my mother loved reliving the old stories of the original fireplace on tv.  I highly recomment this DVD",1265673600,,443,4.068965517241379

Might have wished they had been blended like the carols of the WPIX-TV Yule Log which obviously inspired this, but no matter. The price is right and purchase is recommended.

1789638,5,B00006RJCM,"I agree with the majority here that this is a fantastic DVD.  When I was doing my homework I really wanted a song list.  I wanted something very traditional and soothing.  No obscure songs, not the same 5 songs over and over, and certainly nothing with, for example, Celine Dion showing off her ""range"".  (Sorry to the Dion fans out there.  Not a slam on her, but it isn't what I was looking for.)  The songs included on the DVD are the orchestral versions.  Which are perfectly relaxing and if you want to belt out a tune while listening you're more than welcome to do so without having to mimic an artist's rendition of the song.  The Song Listing from the DVD case itself are as follows:

1. White Christmas
2. Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow
3. The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)
4. It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas
5. Silver Bells

I would have given it a 5* but I gave it 4* because the only thing it doesn't do is the fire logs remain the same throughout the length of time it's on. They don't appear to burn down like real fires.  However for my livingroom, it adds holiday warmth and I am impressed and pleased.  I also like the ability to choose music or not.

1789682,1,B00006RJCM,"I live in California - in an apartment with no fireplace. And - I'm originally from Colorado - so I'm used to a white christmas, and a fire blazing throughout winter.  So I thought it'd be great to buy a dvd of a crackling fire to make it seem more like the holidays.

This dvd, however, was a huge disappointment... so much so that I immediately checked the return policy (which caused me more disappointment since you can't return it once it's opened).  The ""fire"" seems like it's on fast forward... burning at such an incredible rate that I think if you actually watch it for any length of time you would have a seizure!  It is also very obviously computer generated.  With today's technology how is it that a fire can look this fake?  Maybe if you turn your head to the side & squint your eyes it'll look real.  Or maybe I'm just being picky since I've actually seen a fire in real life ; )

I think I'll give it away as a white elephant gift & buy myself a better one!",1227139200,2,973,4.221621621621622

BUT.....the top of the 'fire' is cut-off, When its dark in your room & you put the dvd in & you want to have a 'fire', you just cant feel the 'realness' too too much because it shows the logs burning on the bottom, the fire is GREAT, the sound is GREAT, but the top 1-3(?) inches of the flame is not there, it is cut-off & thats my favorite part cause I love to watch the top point of the fire ripp back & forth ect...!! But regardless of the top, if I ever lost this dvd or it broke, I would 'FOR SURE' be right back here buying it again, It is awesome for the holidays (w/or w/out holiday music) It is also perfect for ANY day or night of the year (silent or w/crackling sounds) This dvd is an AWESOME FIREPLACE DVD overall!! I LOOOVE the crackling sounds, they're extremely calming & comforting while reading & book, just resting or soaking in a bubble bath!! All my Family, Friends & I LOVE it!!!

It is not perfect, the logs just keep burning, they never burn down or fall, but the warm flickering flames and cracking sound are very soothing as an ambient visual and sound background for other activities. I have added a large stuffed dog sitting in front of this fire tableau  to complete the totally artificial image in our little apartment where none of those things are available to us in their real forms.
  I have not listened to the holiday music  as that time is thankfully past.  I may make it through to Spring, glorious Spring, yet!

I ordered it along with the 1951 version of the Christmas Carol which my parents, children and grands watched first.  Afterwards, I asked them to close their eyes for a big surprise.  When they opened them the fire was blazing and crackling and the soothing Christmas music that accompanies it brought in the true spirt of the holiday. Comments like ""this is the best Christmas I can remember"", ""this Christmas was really special"" and ""even I enjoyed this Christmas"" were heard from the group throughout the week.

But the fireplace - YES! It is so perfect. I played it during two holiday parties and people loved it. Our TV room is separate from the living/party rooms and I'd find people chatting ""in front of the fire"" just because it makes the room so nice! It casts that great orangy glow and the crackling sound is just so cool. This DVD just makes ya feel nice.

This reasonably sharp DVD is more than one could expect for the low price.  Definitely plan on utilizing the crackling fire audio or selecting no audio at all; the musical soundtrack is unbearable.

I'm using the DVD on into these early months of the year.  It's very pleasant to have playing in the background while writing, especially when one can look out at falling snow, and the welcoming feeders tipsy with their birds.",1199577600,,590,4.85

The quality of the DVD is very good. Very glowing into our living room.  Very real looking Wish there was more crackling though.  Music is great and quite different than our other Christmas Music Cd's we usually listen to.  So the change was nice.

The only concern my husband has is burn in on our 52"" LCD tv.  He just said not to watch it for long periods.

We bought this for my parents, and my brother and sister in law.  They both have big tv's so I'm sure they will enjoy it as a Christmas Present :)

The neat thing is you can use this anytime.  You can turn off the christmas music and just have the fire.  It doesn't have to be JUST a christmas dvd.  Just a thought.",1198281600,,862,4.053571428571429
1789752,5,B00006RJCM,"A few years ago (actually, it could be a decade or more), I read about a VHS tape that could turn your television set into a simulated fireplace. What a neat idea! I tried to find the tape. Nobody had heard of it. Some looked at me as if I was somewhat loony when I asked. Well, I finally forgot all about it until this Christmas Season. We had an office party and our tech played it on the room's slide screen. I asked about the tape and he explained that there were now plenty of new DVD versions. He said to go to Amazon and type ""fireplace"" into the DVD search. Sure enough, about a dozen versions graced the page. I looked them over and selected ""The Happy Holiday Hearth."" I'm not sure why I chose this particular one. Perhaps, because it was inexpensive. Perhaps, because it was put out by Rhino, a name I could trust. In any case, I'm very happy with it.

We have a 42-inch plasma TV. When the DVD is playing the entire screen is filled with a nice comfortable fire accompanied by snapping and popping sounds and the inflow of air. Our first reaction was to laugh at it in amusement. Of course, it's only psychological but it seemed to make the room warmer and more cheerful. We even seemed to feel a glow on our faces after viewing the flames for a while. It's mesmerizing, just like a real fireplace and provided an interesting and enjoyable experience. Finally we got used to it, but the fire still seemed so realistic that we jokingly expressed some worry now and then that the sparks might ignite the nearby Christmas tree or that the fire might somehow overheat the TV set. Now we greatly enjoy playing it with people over. It gets a lot of reaction and sets a good tone for the gathering.

The instructions are simple and clear. You have three choices: 1. The fire and accompanying sounds; 2. The fire with Christmas music; 3. The fire with fire sounds and Christmas music. Personally, I'm really burned out by Christmas music so I'd opt to use only the first choice. I suppose with guests on Christmas I'll use the music, but 99% of the use this DVD will get will be fire only. Plus, the DVD is in no way restricted to the Christmas Season. We'll probably use it throughout the winter season, and for many seasons thereafter. I like to use it for a visual backdrop while listening to music on the CD player.

It's an interesting, useful and enjoyable DVD. It'll probably get more playing time than any DVD we own. I have only a few minor criticisms. First, I don't particularly care for the patterned brick background. Second, the fire seems overly robust relative to the logs that are burning and I suspect it is being ""aided"" by a little gas from below. Third, The fire view on the DVD cover is a little bigger than the view in our TV screen. For example, a grate clearly shows beneath the fire on the photo but not in our screen. Fourth, The fire plays continuously but there's an awkward gap when one showing ends and it's necessary to start over. Alas, nothing is perfect.

Great to have on when you have company, and the Holiday music with it is wonderful also!!",1173312000,,346,4.181818181818182
1789787,5,B00006RJCM,This DVD is so neat.  I love the ambiance and it's great to have the option of playing Christmas music in the backgroud or just watching the fire crackle in silence.  This can be used all year round with the Christmas music turned off but it would be extra nice to have another music selection such as classical or jazz.,1170720000,3,320,4.316666666666666
1789788,5,B00006RJCM,For those of us who live in condos without a fireplace this is a wonderful alternative. My guests said that it made them feel warmer. The power of suggestion !,1168473600,,159,4.333333333333333
1789789,5,B00006RJCM,I bought this to play during a Holiday Bazaar to make the atmosphere more festive and it worked magically! We have used it with the music and without and it creates a nice ambiance. It is so realistic that my kids even tried to warm their hands up! Great price! Great product!,1168300800,3,276,4.326923076923077
1789800,5,B00006RJCM,"Loved this DVD  reminded me of WPIX in NYC when I was a child, I bought 10 and gave them as Xmas gifts, the people loved it, great price too..",1167782400,7,142,3.7333333333333334
1789801,2,B00006RJCM,After watching this dvd twice I had to switch to just the crackling fire.  The fire is really very nice but not so the music.  It is all the same generic choir and the songs tend to all sound alike.  Just some instrumental music thrown in between would be nice.  I now play the dvd of the fire and my own Christmas music.  For the price it's a good deal.,1167696000,10,354,4.0
1789802,2,B00006RJCM,"While the format of this DVD is excellent, the quality is inferior, at least on the one I received.

It jumps and skips, then hangs up altogether.  I was unable to get past the second song, as I kept having to restart it.",1167523200,4,221,4.116279069767442
1789803,5,B00006RJCM,"I just love this DVD!  I ordered it knowing I would get flack from my kids over a ""fireplace"" on the t.v.  Well, we played it all day long on Christmas Day.  It was delightful to have on while we had company visiting, the music is very soft and subtle.  Later after company left, we put the ""fireplace"" on and just sat mesmerized by the crackling fire.  I intend to use this during the winter months just to sit and read by. I highly recommend this to anyone who just wants to relax.",1167177600,3,483,4.150537634408602
1789804,1,B00006RJCM,"To be blunt, this movie just plain sucked. The main (and only) character, a roaring fire, had absolutely no depth. He was always a roaring fire. He never became a soothing fire or a contemplative fire or a self-doubting fire. Just roaring, all the time. Also, there was absolutely no plot. The fire just roared and roared and nothing ever happened. The fire didn't go anywhere or do anything. You never even found out why he was roaring. I was hoping the perpetually angry fire might get out of control and burn the house down but then learn a valuable lesson by the end. (Now THAT would make a good holiday fireplace movie!) Sadly, the only lesson I learned from purchasing this DVD was caveat emptor.",1166486400,25,702,4.579365079365079
1789805,5,B00006RJCM,"I ordered this fireplace dvd and the fun view version about the same time.  This one is so much better.  The fire is just plain nicer to watch.  Oh and the Christmas carols are perfect, not great background music... not tacky or too loud.  Perfect to sit and read a book and drink a mug of egg nog!",1166140800,5,298,4.086206896551724
1789806,5,B00006RJCM,"Love this DVD - just what we need for moving the tree upstairs away from the room with the fierplace... and on Christmas days when it is too warm to have a fire.  Good for anytime though and very soothing to sit in the room and just listen to other music and the crackle version of the disc.

You will love it - I am buying a few more copies for friends!!!

1789807,5,B00006RJCM,"I absolutely love this DVD...we have a 52"" TV and sitting in the dark with the soft music and blazing fire feels very realistic.  You can almost feel the heat!  I have had this DVD for several years and use it throughout the year as well for a little treat :-)",1165795200,4,260,4.078431372549019
1789808,5,B00006RJCM,"We bought this DVD for ourselves, and played it at our family Christmas party.  The fireplace picture looked beautiful and festive in our photos.  The music provided a lovely background to our conversation and fun!  So we bought three more for gifts, two of which were for homes without fireplaces.  They were delighted!",1164758400,3,320,4.981132075471698
1789809,5,B00006RJCM,"Last year for the holidays, I wanted a ""fireplace"" for family gatherings.  I did my home work and decided on the best DVD to meet my goal...got busy and didn't order.  Decided to do this early so as to not let another year slip by, but I forgot which DVD I wanted, so I had to repeat the ""homework"".  I wanted the actual fire, not the fireplace stonework, did not want the camera to pan in and out, didn't want to see logs being thrown on the fire or even the fire dying down to embers.  I wanted a inviting, realistic fire, all of what this DVD is. The crackling fire sound effects is realistic.  I love Christmas music, the music on this DVD is great background music, I can even listen to the ""12 Days Of Christmas"", which is not a favorite of mine.  When I walk into my great room and see this on the big screen TV, the fire is ""warm"" and glowing. Based on the reviews & internet, it it exactly what I expected.  I recommend this reasonable priced DVD, I actually plan to purchase additional copies for my family members as gifts.",1162598400,76,1034,4.218274111675127

7972662,5,B00006RJCM,"What a pleasant surprise! I wish that I had known earlier such a DVD exists. What wonderful three options ... Listen to old-time beautiful Christmas music while watching logs burning. Or watch and listen to crackling fire (in a virtual fireplace  where fire pops and logs shift). Or enjoy both options combined.

It is so simple and fills the room with so much ""warmth"". It even loops. So, you can play it all night long. And fall fast asleep to it, as my husband and dog had while I finished decorating the tree this year. So sweet to see the smiles on both their faces.

If you don't have a real fireplace in your home, then you may love this virtual fireplace as much as my family and I have this Christmas season. Maybe, one day, we will have a real fireplace. Until then, there is ""The Happy Holiday Hearth""!",1514246400,,813,4.406666666666666

7972664,5,B00006RJCM,"I love this dvd. The traditional christmas music is great. It gives you 3 ways to watch and listen, music with silent fire in background, music with crackling sound fire in background and just crackling fire with no music.

Nice.",1511308800,,128,5.3
7972666,5,B00006RJCM,I love this so much.  My parents got it for me many years ago and throughout this last winter season whenever I had friends over I had it playing on my TV and they were mesmerized by it so I ended up getting a couple of them to give to friends.  They said it's so much nicer than a gas one you turn on in most new houses because they don't look real.  This one is especially awesome because you can either play it just the fire with the crackling or with the holiday music (which is very pretty and traditional) and the crackling together. It's also great because it just starts itself over and plays continuously!,1501718400,,614,4.230769230769231
