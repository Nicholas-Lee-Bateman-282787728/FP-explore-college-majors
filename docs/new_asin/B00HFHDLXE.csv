The Bear rocks around the Wilderness.
I found only that German/Deutsch Release on that page if i spying that side about an other version :(=)
And only an US DVD Release but non an US Blu-ray !?
The Picture 1080p & Sound DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (great bear roar) was really good.
Sound: 1. German 2. English
Subtitles: 1. German 2. Netherlands ...non english subtitles

No Special Features just an bit poor but for that what i payed it was okay ;))
For me the second coolest new kind bear adventure horror mix movie next to my favorite movie 1997 The Edge (kill the motherxxcker^^).

8632460,4,B00HFHDLXE,"After seven years in prison Rowan (James Marsden) is requested to come back to his home town in Alaska to find his best friend Johnny Cadillac (Adam Beach) who guided some poachers into a forest region known as the ""Grizzly Maze"". With poachers killing cubs, bootleg cutters clearing the forest, and the salmon no longer running, Papa Grizzly (Bart the Bear) has become a hunter of men.

Several people are in the woods hunting the bear while it is hunting him. Good role for Billy Bob Thornton. Some good up close grizzly attack scenes. The forest looks so pristine, I thought it was CG.
