8745872,2,B019QZMVSS,"I have purchased a number of blu ray from Amazon France, Italy and Germany.  (I remain perplexed that if a movie has been made available on Blu Ray in these countries, why is not an English-packaged version available?) Until now I have never had an issue with product from these countries. Dialogue is available on a separate English track; subtitles can be turned off. Perfect.
Not so in this case. Although the subtitle menu exists, it does not function. With the French subtitles encroaching on the picture, it is impossible to watch and enjoy.  And this is a great shame, as the remastered picture is outstanding.",1534636800,,617,4.811320754716981
8745873,5,B019QZMVSS,"If you like this movie, then this Blu-ray is the best youll ever see! It is so sharp! It will play in all Blu-Ray players because it is a Region free disc. However take note that when you view it in English it has forced French subtitles that cant be removed by my Blu-ray player. Maybe your player can remove them and if not you will be stuck watching the movie with French subtitles. No problem for me because I backed up the disc and removed the subtitles on the backup.",1522886400,,473,4.208791208791209

8745876,4,B019QZMVSS,"This is a pretty good, if dated, HD transfer of the film.  Suspect it's the same transfer offered for streaming.  Some minor damage is present during the logo and opening credits, but overall is generally acceptable.  Color reproduction is good.  As is common practice with Sidonis (label), French subtitles are forced if you select the English soundtrack.  They are fairly unobtrusive and mostly are visible in the lower black border, but at times over the lower part of the image.  Some folks with higher end players can disable these, but most players won't allow you to.

Apparently, Sony is currently restoring this title and when that is ready, the label Twilight Time will issue the blu in the U.S.  Pending that, this release is as good as it gets.",1475712000,5,756,4.8062015503875966
