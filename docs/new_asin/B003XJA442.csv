4216870,5,B003XJA442,"The film is great, original animation and art and story. The plot makes you wonder where everything is going but it slowly but surely leads to the inevitable.

The story is basically: Mato is a high schooler who befriends the new girl Yomi. They become close friends but one day something happens to Yomi. From the start, as this is going on, two characters in an alternate dimension are fighting. The fighters look an awful lot like Mato and Yomi and the connection between the two worlds is the mystery.

This collection also comes with storyboards, two chibi Nendoroids of Black Rock Shooter and Dead Master, and some promo stuff.",1353283200,5,633,4.745454545454545
4216871,5,B003XJA442,"The Black Rock Shooter Limited Edition Set was amazing! Everything was awesome. But what they might want to include is the size of the droids. They were small enough to fit in the palm of your hand... either way they were still very well done and very cute. Everything was brand new and the box itself was very cool, the only problem I had was that my Dead Master figure had one of it's horns broken when I JUST opened the package. But it was an easy fix, all I need was super glue. Other than that, it was amazing! And the anime had subtitles for many languages. In my opinion, it is the best OVA I have ever watched. I would highly recommend buying this item if you love Black Rock Shooter, Huke, or if you are a hard-core anime fan.",1312329600,17,735,4.183098591549296
4216872,5,B003XJA442,"BLACK  ROCK SHOOTER was an idea, a drawing, a song by ryo(supercell), and now an OVA of epic proportions. [] is set in the year 2050 and the heroine is a young girl living weapon and the last hope for mankind. However this story takes place in the present day world with Mato Kuroi starting junior high school. She meets and befriends a girl named Yomi Takanashi and their lives are good until the outcome of the two worlds collide together. The music is awesome in this show because the majority of the tracks are either recorded or overseen by ryo(supercell) who records Vocaloid songs with Hatsune Miku and the theme song for BRS is sung by Hatsune Miku. Black Rock Shooter has literally became my favorite modern day show. It brings something new and original to the table that I feel anime has been lacking so I will enjoy my collector's box. BLACK  ROCK SHOOTER THE GAME is also coming out on PSP this September. I hope this review was helpful and informative.

If anyone want's further information regarding Black Rock Shooter feel free to ask me and I'll kindly get back to you.",1303603200,21,1086,4.558974358974359

4216875,1,B003XJA442,"In order to reach the happy ending in this story, youll have to suffer through 8 episodes of time-wasting nonsense which, even for an anime fan like me who can enjoy 99% of all the action anime out there, I consider a dismal abysmal failure.
  Now, for slice-of-life anime fans who go out for lots of depressed crying school-girls getting bullied and made fun of by other mean school-girls, there might be some value. Or for people who can get into expressionless tiny fighting girls who can somehow hold up 50 foot long, 500 pound gatling guns and duel it out (a mere few feet away from each other) without getting hit.
  For me, part of what makes an action scene great is the emotion, the feelings, believability, the human element seen in the participants. The combatants in Black Rock Shooter feel no emotions, no pain. Without words, they one-up each other with impossible weapons, and then those weapons don't do any damage. This fighting takes place in a dark lifeless world which seems equally fake.
  I cant stress to you enough how lame this series is. Its a failure in every way, every category. I don't usually write reviews for anime, but this one is a disgrace to the industry and I just simply cant look the other way and move on without passing along my thoughts. Dont waste your time, and certainly not your money, on this garbage.",1397779200,3,1349,4.6
4216876,5,B003XJA442,"The story is not written in a normal manner, so be prepared to need to really watch it without distraction, otherwise you will miss connections of what is really happening.  Basically the story takes place in TWO  universes, or realities at the same time.  The realities are connected by what happens in each place.  So that is why you really need to pay attention.  Subtitles in many languages, so you can still know what is happening with the dialog without learning Japanese.

  After you watch it, watch it again, and you will better understand the stories that are evolving.",1396742400,3,579,4.777777777777778
4216877,5,B003XJA442,"Awesome buy, I received it sooner than the expected delivery date. The petit nendoroid are awesome too, a little struggle to put the pieces in and the stands but got it. Was quite pleased with it.",1394323200,,196,4.472222222222222
4216878,2,B003XJA442,"If I got this for free I'd like it but for the price I feel necessary to say I got screwed over backwards twice. One of the collectibles came broken and the other one broke as soon as you tried putting it together unlock most of the minis I bought these we're by far the worst. The movie was just ridiculous... it was as if written by a 12 year old only not as good. Yea the art was nice but c'mon wheres the plot, wheres the climax, when will it start to get good...",1389830400,,467,3.9263157894736844
4216879,4,B003XJA442,I love Black Rock Shooter this was an amazing anime. Like other reveiws said the figmas are small but they look really cool. The one thing I forgot to check was if it was in English dubbed or Japanese with English subtitles. It's the latter there is no English dubbed so make sure your ok with that before you buy this. I watch most if all my anime subbed so it was ok would have liked the opinion but oh well. Over all really happy with this and if you are a BLACK ROCK SHOOTER FAN then this is a buy. The psp gane is out in English NISAmerica brang it over here for us so if you haven't picked it up then by all means,1388448000,3,619,3.9206349206349205

4216882,5,B003XJA442,"The ""Black Rock Shooter OVA Limited Edition Set w/ Petit Nendoroids (Blu-Ray & DVD Combo)"" is an amazing movie that beats record. I ordered it by the company ""AOYAMA&CO. / bring JAPAN close to you!"" and even received it 22 days before the estimate receive date! :)

Box including:
*Black Rock Shooter Nendoroid Petit
*Dead Master nendoroid Petit

*Frame Book of the movie (Japanese only)

I'm glade to have it and listening it over and over again.
the nendoroid petit are awesome, pretty a nice add to get those limited edition! ^^
the Nendoroid are pretty small but really cute too!
I know that it have Mato and Yomi Nendoroid Petit, so for those that want to continue the collection, it also have an other Black Rock and Dead Master Nendoroid Petit from the same compagny.
(little clue for completing a collection)
It also have the ""Frame Book"" of the movie in the box, but sadly I don't understand Japanese so... stuck at that point...",1355184000,,983,4.611428571428571
8408146,5,B003XJA442,"I bought it used for $30 and I expected only the DVD to show up. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I received everything that was listed, and it was seemed practically brand new! The nendoroids hadn't even been taken out of the box! The storyboard book is so awesome! I'm very happy with everything I got! I would suggest buying this used, but make sure the seller you're buying from has good reviews!",1508371200,,407,4.44
8408147,5,B003XJA442,I was expecting this Yesterday but whatever the package came in perfect condition and am looking forward to setting up the Nendoroids and watching it ^_^,1462406400,,153,4.923076923076923
8408148,4,B003XJA442,"The packaging for this product is incredible. Probably the best packaging I've seen for a product ever, and it's not just the packaging that's great everything inside is done really well too. The included pamphlets, art books, and story board are all really high quality prints and the Nendoroids look fantastic. The OVA itself is only around 40 minutes long and fairly standard fair, but the animation and Huke designs are a step above a lot of anime that's out there. I knew nothing about BRS before this aside from it being a design by Huke, but after watching the OVA it's definitely gotten me interested in the universe.
If you don't like Huke's designs and you're getting this just for the OVA then the price definitely is not worth it, but if you're a fan of Huke or already enjoy BRS this set would be a fantastic addition to a collection.",1443830400,2,847,4.578947368421052

8408151,5,B003XJA442,"I absolutely love everything thats included in this Limited Edition OVA. I really love the OVA and it was my 3rd time watching it when I got this. The art book and story board sketches are pretty awesome too.

The nendoroid petites are cool but they were a pain to get together because some of their limbs would fall off when adjusting them, and they just refuse to fit into the plastic stand. Luckily, I managed to get them on (and it only took me about 6 hours total :/). They are fragile and fall off it rather quickly for me but they look so cool when everything comes out good!",1430438400,2,582,4.243243243243243

8408155,5,B003XJA442,"Very satisfied with this purchase. The OVA is simply awesome, and the bonuses that come with it are fantastic. The nendroids are just simply adorable. My only confusion is that it came with a card talking about the BRS game on psp. And then on the back of the card it gives a ""BRS Activation Code."" I has a website, but there is nowhere on the website to input the code. Does anyone know where to input this code?",1404864000,,413,4.2405063291139244
