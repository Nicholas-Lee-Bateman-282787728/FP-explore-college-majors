7956303,5,B00005Y3ZP,I am a high school coach. I normally coach football but lost the flip in the spring and had to coach baseball instead of track. As you might guess I know little about baseball. So I got this video and must admit that I felt really confident that I was teaching quality mechanics. Both of my pitchers got scholarships to jr. Colleges.,1037232000,4,333,4.387096774193548
7956304,5,B00005Y3ZP,"I have been coaching youth league baseball for 3 years. I am now coaching 8-9 yr olds. With this video, I have finally found out not only proper swing mechanics but how to communicate them to my players. This year we won the league but more importantly my players finally had individual success and a lot of fun. This is a great video. I strongly recommend that all coaches and interested Dads get with the program.",1037232000,5,415,4.473684210526316
