8373767,5,B002MAPFWE,"Renascence: Edna St. Vincent Millay,Poet is a thoughtful, engrossing, video biography of a 20th century woman who not only was a poet's poet but a forerunner to modern day feminists.  St. Vincent Millay soared through life leaving very little doubt as to the woman she was and wanted to be.  But the enigma was her poetry that danced on the waters of life and love oftentimes covered in despair and pain.  Barth and Conboy's loving and meticulous research into Millay's life shows great feeling and care for one of America's greatest poets.  Truly, this video biography is worth your time and money.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Renascence-Edna-St-Vincent-Millay-Poet/dp/B002MAPFWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Renascence: Edna St. Vincent Millay, Poet</a>",1363132800,,794,6.1909090909090905

But here, the poet's words speak and then are caressed with visuals. It seems effortless, almost as if there were no producers or directors or actors, but only Millay's own beautiful words and music and the sea.  It made her come to life in a straightforward yet lyrical way, with a tapestry of images, music and sound effects.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Selected-Poetry-of-Edna-St-Vincent-Millay-Modern-Library-Classics/dp/0375761233/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Selected Poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay (Modern Library Classics)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Selected-Poetry-of-Edna-St-Vincent-Millay-Modern-Library-Classics/dp/0375761233/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Selected Poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay (Modern Library Classics)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Savage-Beauty-The-Life-of-Edna-St-Vincent-Millay/dp/0375760814/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St. Vincent Millay</a>",1275177600,2,1199,8.909090909090908
8373769,3,B002MAPFWE,"Because I have liked Edna St. Vincent Millay since a high school English teacher required my class to memorize large portions of ""Renascence"" that the precocious poet wrote when she was only 20, I came to this DVD wanting very much to like it, but I don't after having watched it twice to see if I missed something the first time I saw it.

Certainly hearing Ms. Millay's poetry read aloud is the best part of this DVD by Vanessa Barth and Doreen Conboy although I didn't particularly care for the way the woman read Millay. Caedmon I believe produced an LP years ago of Ms. Millay reading her poetry. Using the poet's own voice would have made this DVD much, much better as would have printing the poems selected for inclusion as well. Both the still photos and the music add to the DVD's appeal. Having the photos of the mug shots of Sacco and Vanzetti, along with the front page of the newspaper account of their conviction, become negatives when we are told that they were executed was brilliant. I wish there had been more such moments in this hour-long film. The three literary types dissecting Ms. Millay's poetry, however, reminded me once again that poetry should be read aloud and listened to rather than explicated to death. Finally these women's attempts to illustrate much of the poetry look like something a first year film student would produce. Then there is the final image of a barefoot woman writing ""Vincent"" in the sand.

Ms. Millay's poetry is what saves this film.",1256601600,4,1487,4.650190114068441
