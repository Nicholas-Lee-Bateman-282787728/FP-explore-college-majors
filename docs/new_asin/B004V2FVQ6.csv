8442776,4,B004V2FVQ6,"Jhutha Sach was a pretty ordinary family comedy movie. It was quite watchable and nice but at the end of it there was a feeling it could have been given a skip. I watched it mainly to see Rekha and to an extent Dharmendra. Dharmendra plays a dual role in this film, one of a married man and the other of a selfish and greedy criminal. When Rekha's husband passes away, she hires his lookalike for a certain period of time until she will be able to tell her children the truth. Well, the story is quite inconsequential and not very interesting. The film was well done though - it was light and simple, not overly melodramatic but it still lacked charm and the execution felt weak. Rekha does a good job in a restrained act of a young widow and Dharmendra plays his two roles without being very impressive. You can watch Jhutha Sach",1305763200,,830,4.361290322580645
