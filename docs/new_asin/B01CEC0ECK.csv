7682644,4,B01CEC0ECK,"Sequel to the great French kids movie based on books and an old TV series.  This time round the war is over, and Sebastian is wagging school sledding with his giant white dog friend who saves his life moments later.  Angelina from the first movie is flying home on a military transport which crashes on the Italian border.  Caesar the old man looking after Sebastian isn't taking the news that he's now going to have to raise him by himself and ignoring everyone's advice to just accept and mourn her, decides to pay Sebastian's dad to fly them over the crash site where he expects to find her alive and bring her home.  Problem is for reasons only known to himself, he doesn't like Sebastian's father, in fact he's never even told him Sebastian exists, he hasn't told Sebastian either, but eavesdropping the boy learns the truth and confronts Caesar.  The two agree not to tell the pilot he is the father until Angelina is found.  However the pilot doesn't want Caesar on his plane, is afraid of Belle and insists on flying to the border himself.  Sebastian and Belle of course sneak on board and somehow aren't noticed until the plane is headed home from the crash site and Sebastian seizes control of the plane after Belle attacks the pilot. Trying to go back steer the plane where he saw some orange smoke of course Sebastian not knowing anything about flying a plane crashes it.  Like all kids films, other than the arm from the dog attack, everyone is uninjured.  The pilot is rightly not happy, but Belle and Sebastian decide to run off and find Angelina on their own.  The pilot of course has no choice but to tag along.  Of course there will be plenty of hazards along the way for Sebastian to tackle, and Belle to save him from.  The predictable plot between a man who just sees the kid as a brat at first and his son who doesn't like him based on Caesar's bias opinion changes over the duration of the film too.

There's a lot of soot obviously being rubbed on the canine and human actors and things like this.  Mild spoilers without giving away what happens after Sebastian crashes the plane as that's the adventure your waiting to discover, some things could have been filmed a bit better rather than having everything look good.  At one stage the dog should be barking in a threatening I'm going to kill you way, but Belle is just barking like someone's at the door.  Another has a character who Sebastian is surprised is a girl, when she looks like a girl from the first moment we see her.  Belle also is asked by Sebastian to sniff a something Angelina left behind two years ago and find her and starts tracking her over ground she's never been on.  But still it's an enjoyable kids film and if you're a fan of the original, well worth
checking out.

Region 4 DVD information - Unlike the first movie DVD, you can't watch this one dubbed in English.  There isn't a lot of dialogue in this sequel anyway, so that's not really an issue, and most of the dialogue like the plot, follows the predictability of a kids film anyway.",1478390400,7,3040,4.482758620689655

This adaptation of that classic story will bring tears to your eyes. The dog is magnificent as well as the young boy who plays Sebastian. As others have mentioned the scenery is absolutely gorgeous and the cinematography is outstanding. While the story line, at times, gets a bit to sentimental for my tastes - it really does not detract, overall, from the beauty of film.",1532304000,,521,4.736263736263736
8752830,4,B01CEC0ECK,"I'm a sucker for a big white dog in general and Belle in particular, I'll admit that right up front. The plot of this sequel is a little less straightforward than the first movie's and honestly I think that was a bit of a mistake. It was distracting enough that I was noticing things like a large, fluffy, extremely flammable sight hound supposedly tracking a days-old scent through a raging forest fire when my disbelief should have been firmly suspended. Belle vs. the Nazis, somehow, I was able to take in stride; Belle vs. forest fire was a little harder. That said, I still enjoy the heck out of the adventures of Belle and Sbastien and do not the least regret buying this movie!",1527638400,,684,4.524193548387097
8752831,5,B01CEC0ECK,"The sequel to ""Belle and Sebastian"".  Very good movie.  Very good family movie.  Very good dog movie.  I enjoyed the original Belle and Sebastian movie and also enjoyed this one - the sequel.  The movie is in French with available English subtitles.  Even so, it was well worth it.  The subtitles did not take away from viewing the movie.  If you like dog movies, you will like this one.  Recommend.",1520899200,,399,4.585714285714285
