2521677,4,B000EJ9V9S,"I purchased this set with reservations and much to my astonishment the copies were not bad at all. The Perils of Pauline would be the best copy I have seen, although not perfect ,the stork club was ok. How about some more Betty Hutton movies. If anyone is reviewing this lets see more Betty Huttom films on DVD

2521678,5,B000EJ9V9S,"My sweetie is a Betty Hutton fan, as am I.

Perils of Pauline -- reminded me of the old serials on Saturdays at the local theater, and the original Perils of Pauline features. Ms. Hutton
much prettier than the original Pauline.
Enjoyable comedy antics of old time filming. We laughed a good deal and did
enjoy the flick.

Stork Club -- excellent B&W film--- Barry Fitzgerald was a favorite of mine and
Betty Hutton was very good too. Always enjoyed BH singing and she does sing some oldies in this flick.

Glad we bought it and enjoyed it.",1299024000,4,539,4.479591836734694
2521679,5,B000EJ9V9S,"This DVD set includes two movies. Both are good quality, and the price can't be beat! I enjoyed going back in time and watching these classic films.",1280188800,5,148,4.518518518518518
2521680,5,B000EJ9V9S,"I absolutely LOVE Betty Hutton - so vibrant and SO FUNNY!  I'd seen 'Perils Of Pauline' many times, but never saw 'The Stork Club' intact; which is why I bought this.  What a great star!  If a DVD can be worn out; I'll definitely do it to this!",1269734400,6,244,4.041666666666667
2521681,4,B000EJ9V9S,"OK, so maybe quality of the prints used isn't too crash hot but you are getting two great films for the price of one so you can't really complain. I had already seen Perils of Pauline on video and wanted to see the Stork Club. A good double to give to your mum or anyone who likes 1940s musicials (if they don't already have them.)",1181865600,13,331,4.107692307692307
2521682,5,B000EJ9V9S,"Betty Hutton is The WOW Girl.  Annie Get Your Gun Proved that. Great looking and funny, she was (the lass is still living) a perfect comedy star. For awhile, she was the reigning queen of Hollywood.  Let's not forget that.  Her sad songs are softly whimsical.  She's a doll and one of the very best.

Have you her her ""Murder! He said!""? WOW! It's murder! (As is very good!)",1167782400,15,374,4.36231884057971
8110637,5,B000EJ9V9S,Great movies. Betty Hutton just terrific as always. Really fun musical numbers. Good quality DVDs as well. Am happy I got!,1513382400,,122,4.857142857142857

8110639,5,B000EJ9V9S,Interesting old movies - I bought it for the Pearl White biography and though its not factually accurate Betty Hutton does a great job with the action. She always does well with that sort of part. But she also sings a song that gives Alice Faye a run for her money - I was surprised at the emotion and depth she had. It show how typecast people were in those days of studio contracts. I think she could have had a wider range of parts in the movies than she was given which might have given her a longer career life.,1494460800,,516,4.118811881188119
8110640,5,B000EJ9V9S,Good clean fun with no potty mouthing or nudity. Betty Hutton is a real hoot to watch and hear sing. Highly recommended!,1475712000,,120,4.5
8110641,5,B000EJ9V9S,"Enjoyed these old shows, but they're definitely for a certain ""niche"" viewer.",1467417600,,77,5.5
8110642,5,B000EJ9V9S,"The Acme version from VCI studios, released March 28, 2006, Video quality is okay to good, and I love these old movies from my youth, brings back great memories.",1430524800,2,161,4.586206896551724
8110643,4,B000EJ9V9S,"What's not to love about Betty Hutton, and these two movies show what a great talent she was!  The Stork Club is classic screwball comedy, while The Perils of Pauline follow the life of Silent Movie serial star Pearl White.  Both excellent pictures!  A great value to get both movies on one DVD.  We would definitely recommend it.",1406246400,2,330,4.637931034482759

8110645,5,B000EJ9V9S,I am in the process of collecting everything about Betty.  This is a wonderful combo pack at a great value.  Highly recommend for Betty fans.,1397779200,3,141,4.6
8110646,4,B000EJ9V9S,"The transfer isn't the best. When the movies don't seem to have a big sales potential, they really don't restore them. But I am happy to have it.",1394755200,3,145,4.214285714285714
