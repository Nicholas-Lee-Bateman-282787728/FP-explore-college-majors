8447552,4,B004XWLDM0,"This moody, doom-laden, dark film (originally titled ""Sauna"", for the holy -- or demonic -- spot located in a kind of uncharted village of blighted souls, site of a vacated monastic establishment, where most of the action takes place) is very strange, mighty peculiar, downright weird, and difficult to comprehend. It also absorbs one's attention, like a sponge sucks up vinegar. So, even if one comes away with only a vague idea of what it is all about or to what it amounts, the movie is eminently worth seeing.

As a Lutheran  with more than such a layman's usual understanding of Eastern Orthodoxy, the two faiths (in folkloric manifestations of Scandanavian Lutheranism and of Russian Orthodoxy) in some perverse ways which are obliquely at loggerheads with each other in this motion picture, I think that I can sense some of the mysticism and morality of what the film conveys. However, I also fear that I could be utterly wrong about any or all of that applied to this movie, so I shall not belabour it here. What I do come away with fairly certain about is that the Holy (or merely Satanic) sauna, and the village and its people, is not a site where, as the legend goes, one attains in its waters the propitiation of one's sins through grace, but rather where one confronts the fruits of an human's transgressions in agonising expiation through suffering, anguish, and blood. The number of souls in the strange village set in a fetid, very northerly swamp, varying slightly upwards with the military and other victims of the two Swedish brothers who are alike soldiers, surveyors, and government officials (among a research team comprised of Swedes and Russians), is a clue that what transpires is supernatural retribution for the guilt that they bear.

The colours are so muted that one might wonder why the movie was not shot in b&w. Either way, the film would (and does) convey the gloomy doings and atmosphere of so much mystery, eeriness, and autumnal decay. It would have been helpful to have some explanatory bonus features with the film (the edition viewed being Matchbox Film MBF-012), but of that kind of ""extra"" there is only the film's trailer; the English subtitles function well. The viewer is ""on his own"" in coping with so much of the ambiguity that he encounters in this motion picture. This one is for fans of cinema of adventurous, even ""far out"", tastes!",1479340800,,2382,4.804878048780488
