4654742,1,B005CVFYZ8,What I expected to be a scary movie turned out to be a bunch of losers too lazy to do the work to achieve what they want.  Instead they were making bargains with an entity.  This was reality T.V. gone bad.  Lizard Lick Towing is more interesting than these guys.  Bad!  Really bad!,1326672000,,281,4.226415094339623

4654744,3,B005CVFYZ8,"This is an intriguing idea, a documentary/reality show around the idea of selling your soul to the Devil.  The film has all the advantages of a reality show--it's ""real""--but also some of the drawbacks--""why are these people taking this so seriously?""  If you're curious about the occult or the possibility of literally selling yourself to Satan, this DVD might be for you.  Obviously some of the participants believe this is possible, while others--like the attorney who draws up the pact--are going along as a goof only.  The fact that the lead ""seller"" isn't all that sure only lends credibility to the proceedings.  There's also a discussion with a variety of ""experts"" about what ""selling your soul"" really means.  It's hip, cool stuff, stylish and interesting and there's enough paraphernalia and witchcraft to be intriguing.  The LA scene is the backdrop, which gives a sunny ordinariness to the devilish doings, a nice contrast.  The lead character seems to want to be a rock star in order to ride around in limos and be recognized by others, but in typical fashion, he never picks up a guitar or sings a note.  The last act turns a little more serious and asks the question, ""what if this is real?"" which is nicely scary and creepy.  A good effort.",1320796800,,1257,4.804651162790698

8465903,1,B005CVFYZ8,"I found this to be a boring documentary. It starts by interviewing a bunch of people as to why they would sell their soul to Satan. One person, who I never heard of, goes through great lengths to sell his soul. He apparently uses a ceremony from an old book. I liked the tip to Manly P. Hall, my favorite occult author.

The whole concept of selling your soul to the devil (assuming they both exist) oozes with irony. It seems to me the very act of wanting to sell your soul would cause you to lose salvation and the devil would already have it, so why make a deal, and why make it difficult?

A bunch of hand held nonsense, one guy going shopping, lighting candles, gathering blood in a humane way (not exactly what Satan wants) and acting weird.

Might have appeal to the young and curious dark youth, but for a guy who has sold his soul a few dozen times or so, might find it boring.

Parental Guide: No sex or nudity.

BTW, The occult writers have it all wrong as Satan is a later manifestation of evil.",1408492800,,1007,4.223958333333333
8465904,5,B005CVFYZ8,"Selling your soul isn't something to be taken lightly...I'm not a religious person, but I still wouldn't be making pacts with the devil.  I mean, what if it's actually real?  Well, I just had to see this out of curiosity.  It's actually pretty funny...it's definitely a quirky one!
