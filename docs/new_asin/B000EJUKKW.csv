8110773,3,B000EJUKKW,"Apollo Moon Landings is a quick overview of the highlights of the project Apollo and the moon landings (just as the title suggests).  After a very brief introduction starting with the Russian sputnik, Alan Shephards first flight and the rest of project Mercury laying out the groundwork for why America set it sights on the moon, there's a brief run through of the highlights of project Gemini (Ed White's spacewalk, first docking on Gemini 8 etc) then onto project Apollo.
Starting with the Saturn spacecraft, the video briefly mentions each major Apollo flight (not including test flights) including the fire on Apollo 1.  The first few flights only take up a few minutes of the 72 minute run time with more and more time dedicated to each of the flights past Apollo 11, the actual moon landings.
These are high level overviews of the achievements of each flight with interspersed actual audio from the flights and moonwalks and a good narrative explaining the highlights. The background music is a bit cheesy making me believe this video was actually produced a long time ago.
In the extras section there is a 12 minute even briefer overview of projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo.  Whilst a nice addition you don't really gain anything extra that you didn't learn during the main presentation.
If you are looking for a very high level and brief overview of the highlights of the moon landings then this is a decent video, however I can't help but feel that more details should have been presented and the main presentation should have been lengthened to about double what it was.
Not bad but not the best out there.",1347235200,,1619,4.795698924731183
