These DVDs are some of his old shows, I wish Amazon would sell them all!  We have many music CDs too.  But now I buy them for our Grandkids, and they Love and ask to watch them all the time.  When my Daughter was 4 years old, Fred came to Ann Arbor Mi, to do a live show, He kept the audience enthralled.  My daughter got his autograph, she's 28 now, she still has it!",1463356800,,544,4.0
