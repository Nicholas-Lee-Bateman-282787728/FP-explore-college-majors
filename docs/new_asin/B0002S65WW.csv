2117268,4,B0002S65WW,While this is a good solid film about one of the fights that we had to win. I was very disappointed that Admiral Halsey was not mentioned as he was one of the major reasons why we won that fight. Also The first Battleship versus Battleship fight was not mentioned when Adm Lee with the Battle Ships USS Washington and the South Dakota literally blew the Old Battle Ship Kiroshima right out of the water with some outstanding Radar Shooting. Oh well!,1285632000,,449,4.487804878048781

2117270,4,B0002S65WW,"My review is based on the VHS tape version that was released years earlier.

Given the magnitude of Guadalcanal and the number of important battles fought on and near it, the relatively short running time of this documentary can only begin to touch the surface of the overall story.  Instead, it deals heavily with the emotions of the men on both sides who fought the battles and in that regard I think it does an admirable job of conveying to the viewer a little of what they felt.

I've shown this video to a number of WWII veterans and they have unanimously given it high marks.  Those wanting a more precise historical account of the Guadalcanal campaign may be somewhat disappointed and might be better served by reading one of the many excellent books published on the subject including the companion book to this video.",1175904000,9,826,4.675862068965517
2117271,2,B0002S65WW,"Just like ""The Battle for Midway"" and ""The Search for the Battleship Bismarck"" by NG, this film stays the same tone as the two. They gather survivors from the Guadalcanal talking about the war while searching for warships in this campaign. Of course, the combat footages interweave during the running time.

This campaign was fought so intensively for six months on the ground, at sea and in the air. It turns the tide of the Pacific theater. Before it, the Japanese always advance. After it, the Japanese always retreat. This film doesn't give me the feelings of the significance. In addition, it narrows the scope of this campaign and many important battles are not included. The well-known ""Tokyo Express"" is never mentioned in this film, which is another disappointment.

To conclude, this film doesn't give you the whole picture of the lengthy Guadalcanal campaign. Another DVD ""Guadalcanal: The Island of Death"" is the very choice.",1170460800,14,937,5.038709677419355
2117280,5,B0002S65WW,Great documentary of the Battle for Guadalcanal. The interviews are wonderful. It's probably not as great with the underwater explorations. Don't expect Titanic. World War II fans will love it.,1422057600,,193,5.466666666666667

2117284,4,B0002S65WW,"Film covers the 1991 and 1992 expeditions to locate and identify 50 known ships in Iron Bottom Sound off Guadalcanal during WW2, of which they successfully find 14.  The land battle concentrates on the Marines taking the airstrip eventually known as Henderson Field and defending it until the Army takes ownership.  The naval battles of Savo Island and Guadalcanal in Aug. and Nov. 1942 are the primary focus at sea, as these yield the most ships that Ballard is mapping.",1372032000,,471,4.875

2117286,5,B0002S65WW,"A spectacular video history of the famous Naval battle at Guadalcanal in November of 1942.  There are actual American and Japanese films included along with many personal stories.  Letters from a young Naval Officer (my father) to his soon-to-be widow will be read aloud, leaving you in tears (this widow..my mother... is present, in the film at the reunion), and there is a reunion gathering at Guadalcanal 50 years later to remember those who died and those who lived to tell their tales. Some of those who lived from this battle are present to give touching interviews, and you will meet some of the natives of the island in costume, as they help to celebrate this reunion.  A must see for any WWII Navy history enthusiast.  It will leave you well informed and full of patriotic gratitude for the bravery of those who fought in this important battle.",1360540800,3,853,4.743243243243243

I originally bought this DVD about 10 years ago.  This expedition was led by Bob Ballard (of Titanic and Bismarck fame) in 1992 on the 50th anniversary of the August 7, 1942 US Marine Invasion and the August 8-9, 1942 Battle of Savo Sound. Among the sunken ships they located on the floor of ""Iron Bottom Sound"" was the USS Quincy (CA-39) which was sunk in that battle.  My uncle was the Navigator of the Quincy and killed in that battle.

One of the highlights that adds to the understanding in this film is the inclusion of surviving veterans and spouses of casualties of this battle, with their reminiscences.  Not only American survivors were including, but also Japanese.

After having the privilege this past August of attending the 70th Anniversary Comemoration of the August 7, 1942 Invasion of Guadalcanal, I bought 2 copies of this DVD for my cousins.

It is well done and well worth buying, especially for review every few years to recall the sacrifices made for us so long ago.",1351468800,4,1206,5.557377049180328

8031211,4,B0002S65WW,"If you understand the history of the battle and the importance of it in World War II, this is a great video.  If you realize that three times as many sailors died as soldiers on the island itself, and you comprehend the magnitude of the battle, this is an OK video.  There is no picture of the whole of Iron Bottom Sound.  How about a map in the video at the start that shows the rough ship locations.  It mentions that they found 18 wrecks, maybe a graphic would have made that more meaningful.

You also don't get the significance of some of the comments.  The Atlanta was sunk by friendly fire from the USS San Francisco, we're told.  In another sequence, an Atlanta survivor is saying that he saw Normal Scott die on the Atlanta's bridge.  There's a huge back story there that makes the two comments, unrelated in the video, take on a heavy significance.

They also kinda passed over the fact that the battle that sunk the Kirishima was two days long, and that NONE of the ships they showed actually are responsible.  The ships they showed were sunk on the first day of the battle, the Kirishima was sunk by the Washington the second night, after the US decided to send in its battleships.
