There is nothing artistic about this movie.  It is cliche, silly, and not at all frightening.  Everything about it screams awful, low budget, softcore adult film: the acting, wardrobe, cinematography, effects, lackluster romance, and most of all--forced plot.

Normally, I can sit through a B or C grade horror flick for solely the entertainment aspect, but this movie was just unbearable.  It seems to sacrifice the entertainment aspect in an attempt to be ""artsy,"" yet it comes off as mediocre as the main character's paintings.

If you are interested in a thought-provoking and beautifully rendered vampire film, invest your time in something else, particularily ""Let the Right One In.""",1240012800,8,762,5.104838709677419

The other reviewers have done a fair job at explaining why this movie is bad (LOW budget effects, didn't follow the original story much at all, etc). But what really puzzles me is why they hired Andrew Bryniarski to play Dracula. Up until now, most of us horror-philes agreed that the chubbiest vampire on record was Lon Chaney Jr's ""Son of Dracula"" (which I liked in spite of Chaney's being a well fed vamp). Bryniarski has about 100 pounds on Chaney. Tall? Gaunt? Corpselike? No way- this Drac's been to the ""all you can eat"" buffet. Now I gave it two stars because I did like the period costumes. I mean, I had to find something redeeming in this film, eh?

3437843,1,B0019K4YSO,"I give this movie one star for Wes Ramsey (Bram Stoker) who I kept wishing, as he was running across Europe, would run into a better movie. He was the one bright spot in the whole thing. There was only one segment out of Stoker's short story, and that was Bram being chased by the dog (a Rottweiler) which should have been a wolf(couldn't they even get a German Shepherd to be a fake wolf?) and then rescued. Andrew Bryniarski was one of the most unappealing Draculas I've ever seen. To the writer's credit, they did try to insert a bit from Stoker's book for Dracula to say, his speech where he's talking about himself: ""we have a right to be proud...the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland, etc."", but it was so garbled you could hardly understand what he was saying. He practically threw that speech away, he rushed through it so quickly.  And to be a bit picky-when was this movie set? Costumes were from the 1850s-90s. Women's hair was all wrong, they NEVER wore it loose during these years. And the French people in the cabin talked about the Bastille and the Revolution. Just how old were these people if it was even set in 1850? I agree with another reviewer about the Count's castle being a mausoleum?? uh-huh. Also, Dracula scorned Stoker's use of mortal weapons but later didn't seem to mind picking up a sword to fight Admiral Murray.  And for the record, Bram Stoker's wife's name was Florence. If you don't know anything about Stoker or Dracula, the book or short story and just want to watch a vampire flick, you might not mind it.

3437844,1,B0019K4YSO,"This is without a doubt the most boring version of the Dracula legend I've ever seen Andrew Bryniarski is the worst actor to date to play the legendary blood sucker his on screen persona makes Dracula look more like a supernatural date rapist than the prince of darkness the whole story tells parts of the original tale completely out of sequence and adds parts that clearly don't belong. The pace of the movie is horrible I found myself falling asleep and having to back up to the last part I had seen on at least three occasions the director did a terrible job the movie looks like it was filmed with video equiptment and looks bad oddly some of the sets looked good but I seriously doubt that Dracula lived in a mausoleum every film I've seen has clearly shown the castle to be in ruins for the most part as you would expect since it's owner was dead and had not been lived in let alone kept all spiffy clean.
The phoney accents used by the actors are annoying and the over use of voice overs would make Morgan Freeman run out screeming in the night.
And whats up with those people in the cabin and the freaks looking in the window all in all this movie makes no sence.
It makes you wonder who would release such a piece of junk untill you remember seeing the Lions Gate logo at the beginning of the flick, Lions Gate just doesn't care what they release they're killing the genre one movie at a time sure every now and then they release a good one but they release more garbage than a chinese  resteraunt.

Some critics believe the she wrote the story herself as the literary style is unlike Stoker's.  Be that as it may, the film has no resemblance to the original story or even to a halfway competent B-movie.  The plot, direction, writing, sets and production values are ghastly.  Filmed entirely in and around Los Angeles, ""Dracula's Guest"" has the dramatic impact of a 1950's television commercial and all the thrills of watching paint dry.  While Wes Ramsey is quite good as Bram Stoker and does not overdo the Irish accent, his love interest, Elizabeth, played by Kelsey McCann, mangles the British accent with nasal American vowels.  Some of the supporting players are quite good, other terrible, but even the best performances can't lift this tedious, cheaply made exploitation movie from the mire of its miserable script and equally miserable direction.

3437848,2,B0019K4YSO,"They should have gone back to the editing room and picked up the film cuts on the floor and inserted them into the final version.  Perhaps, it would have made it a decent film on the subject of Dracula.

As it is, this film is conjoined with gaps in the storyline.  Elizabeth's conversational style is so laden with Victorian colloquialism that you feel sorry for her to have to recite this script.  Definitely, as Elizabeth softly stated, she was ""broken"".

Count Dracula was as menacing and sinister as a goldfish.  Forget about any European sex appeal.  It isn't there.  Andrew Bryniarski,the actor, had a few brief moments,but he had little to work with on this script.  Probably, the worst Dracula presentation that I have seen in film, and I have seen a great number of Dracula type films in my life.

Michael Feifer wrote and this directed this film.  He has an impressive resume, and he did a cameo as Admiral Murray's driver.  However, Mr. Feifer's resume could have survived without this inclusion.

A nice touch was to cast Bram Stoker,the author of Dracula,as the lead character and romantic interest for Elizabeth.  Unfortunately, Elizabeth Murray was a bit too liberalized for the Victorian era, and the match did not seem to be made in heaven, especially with her bloodline and special destiny which her father aptly reminded her.

The motif of star crossed lovers facing separation and tragedy is a noble concept which the film explored in a very limited fashion. Perhaps, this is where the fault is -the story never undocked from its moorings.  If it had, it would have been a better story.",1267315200,,1607,4.789090909090909

3437850,1,B0019K4YSO,"Bled (Christopher Hutson, 2009)

Somewhere inside Bled, the new movie from Charlie Hutson (Dark Reality), is a really interesting movie straining to get out. The linked subjects of vampires and addiction are inherently interesting, especially in our current addiction-obsessed climate; I've seen the parallel touched on in a few movies, but I've never seen a full-length treatment of it. While there's no denying this is one, it is anything but interesting.

Sai (The Mirror's Sarah Farooqui) is an artists who's on her way up. She meets the mysterious Renfield (Ghost Rider's Jonathan Oldham) at a gallery opening, and he turns her onto a mysterious new drug that (he claims) is harvested from the bark of a tree in Eastern Europe. Okay, except that it looks a whole heck of a lot like blood. When Sai inhales the smoke that rises when you cook the stuff up in a spoon (can you see the incredible subtlety here?), she finds herself transported into a dream-world which gives her all sorts of artistic inspiration, not to mention erotic fantasies about her friend Royce (Sunday Evening's Chris Ivan Cevic). As time goes on, naturally, she needs more and more of the drug to be transported, and things get worse when her pal Eric (Shadows' Alex Petrovich) swipes her stash after his first taste of the stuff.

I don't think mentioning vampires in any film where one of the characters is named Renfield is all that much of a spoiler, even when the word ""vampire"" never actually pops up in the movie. But the whole vampire thing is a subplot here, actually (another take on the subject matter that could have made this a far more interesting movie than it actually is); instead, the main focus of the movie is on addiction. Where that, too, could have been done very well, the film is instead satisfied to stop off at all the usual clich&eacute;s rather than trying to do anything interesting, original, or nuanced with the subject matter. The acting is in general substandard, though Cevic seems an especially likable chap, and may have himself a future in the acting world. Unfortunately, his relatively good performance is stuck inside a script that seems as if it's actively fighting against going anywhere. You're probably better off forgetting this thing even exists. *",1259539200,5,2272,4.880829015544041
3437851,5,B0019K4YSO,"""GREETINGS & SALUTATIONS!"" The book titled: Bram Stoker's Dracula's Guest was really made into a film almost to the letter. It would also be a good idea to read the book because so much action takes place, it will make it easier to comprehend some of the scenes like the ""rat people"" living in the garbage-dumps of the outskirts of 18th and 19th century France. The scene of the ""Rat People,"" is not unlike Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and Mrs. Lovett who used the human flesh of Todd's victims in her meat pies. We are not told directly that they intended to not only rob the young man, Bram Stoker's character, they planned to eat him as they also cannibals.  The charcater of Dracula was bigger and stronger than others who played that role as he had centuries of experience as a survivor.  This motion picture is definately a cut about other ""Vampyre"" movies and equal to ""Nosferatu"" of 1921, and ""Dracula"" of 1931. Bela Lugosi and Max Schreck would be proud of Andrew Bryniarski who played Dracula in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula's Guest.""

3437853,3,B0019K4YSO,"This vampire film takes some previously used ideas and makes them new. In other films such as ""Side FX"" the vampirism comes from a drug. So too in this film, only this isn't as straight forward as film-makers have allowed a supernatural element to remain.

In this the drug-user is transported to a place that is not simply a product of the mind. One interacts with real vampires there, and in some cases upon return to this reality something of that world is brought back.

Sai (Sarah Farooqui) is a young artist who is led to believe that trying this drug will allow her to improve her art through seeing the world in a new way.

I have a few quibbles, in that all the starlets keep all their clothes on even when transported to the alternate reality they get a nice red dress to wear. This slightly reduces the sexual appeal of the film.

The production values are very good. The cover though shows a fanged woman, and instead, in the film they have a number of jagged sharp teeth.",1247270400,,984,4.419889502762431
3437854,2,B0019K4YSO,"Unlike some I actually thought that the production values weren't all that bad.

What is bad about this film is the plot, coupled with direction/editing that sucks any sense of excitement out of the film before it gets to your screen.

Take for instance Dracula is able, using his mind powers to lift a guy off his feet and make him float towards a noose. The film suddenly cuts as apparently we can't see him die, because that would be too exciting and we only see the results. Odd too, given these powers that in the end Dracula chooses to fight it out with a sword.

Dracula's guest in this film is Kelsey McCann who is quite pretty and does her best at an English accent. She is imprisoned by Dracula who puts her in a cave, that's got a cage door across the front to prevent her getting out. Her love finds her and they exchange conversation through the bars. She says something like ""He took something that I was saving for you"" (meaning her virginity), though we never see that because that too would be too exciting. Thus, it's overly-big then on dialogue. Dracula and guest spend quite some time at it and all this leaves one bored and waiting for something to happen.

8274164,1,B0019K4YSO,"So I bought this DVD 4-pack of vampire movies. I only paid $5 for it. And after watching the third movie on the set, BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA'S GUEST, it's safe to say I was robbed.

Since I've never read the Stoker story from which the film's title was taken, I can't say how closely the movie follows the original plot, but for Stoker's sake, I hope it's not very close, because this movie was BOOOOOORRRR-RRRRRRRINGGGGG!!!

The movie concerns a young Bram Stoker (Wes Ramsey, ""CSI: Miami""), in love with a young Elizabeth Murray (Kelsey McCann, ""The O.C.""), much to the chagrin of Elizabeth's father, Admiral Murray. The Admiral forbids the Irishman from seeing his daughter for one year. Stoker agrees and goes off to a meeting with Count Dracula about a castle the Count wishes to purchase. Afterward, Stoker retreats to a country inn where I assume he's going to spend the next year. Meanwhile, Elizabeth, in tears, decides to flee home on a train and be with her love. She's met at the train station by Count Dracula who offers her a ride in his carriage. She unloads on him the mountain of woe she's living with and the Count consoles her like a gentleman. Then he puts her to sleep with his vampire powers and when she wakes up she finds herself in Transylvania, at the Count's castle.

The Count tells her of a long-standing feud between the Murrays and the Draculas and how he's kidnapped her in hopes of bringing the Admiral to him so they can settle the score once and for all. Oh, and he's also going to impregnate her. Personally, I'm not sure the Count understands the definition of the word ""guest"".

Word reaches Bram and he takes off immediately for Transylvania. The Admiral, as well, is on his way, and when the two get there, a climactic battle ensues between the old enemies, while Bram is charged with keeping the Admiral's little girl safe.

You know, it took me about 5 minutes to lay down that plot, but it took the movie 86 minutes to show it. And that was definitely about 60 minutes too long. Much of the movie was taken up with people walking or Count Dracula taking a dramatic pause between the clauses of each sentence. This movie was definitely not built for speed.

The meandering pace was the least of the problems here, though. Let's start with the acting. For whatever reason, writer/director Michael Feifer (BOSTON STRANGLER: THE UNTOLD STORY) has cast Andrew Bryniarski as the Count and anyone who's seen the two recent TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE movies (Bryniarski starred as Thomas Hewitt/Leatherface in the 2003 and 2006 movies), knows that dude is not small. 6 foot 3, this bodybuilder doesn't have the grace to pull off king of the Vampires. And Feifer really should have told him to stop waving his fingers in the air, we saw the pointed fingernails, yes, so stop trying to be fancy. He was like a kid with a new toy, showing those things off.

The Count's Transylvanian castle was very obviously filmed inside a business after hours or while they were closed on the weekend. I kept thinking it looked like a bank or a college, maybe even a mausoleum, and I was right. A mausoleum was thanked in the credits. The inability to suspend my disbelief and convince myself they really were inside an ancient castle in the 1800s ruined every scene that took place there.

Also let's talk about the vampire himself. Other than the Count--yes, he was killed in the end, because isn't he always?--there was exactly one death in this movie, and that was by hanging, not by being drained of all blood by Count Dracula. Oh, Dracula killed the fellow, but he caused him to be magically lifted off the ground and carried toward a noose where he was hanged until death. So, really, any tension possibly caused by having this hulking brute of a vampire stalking you is completely undercut by not having him do any actual vampiric killing AT ALL throughout the entire movie. It's a vampire, movie;
I expected at least ONE fangs-in-the-neck death.

The acting on the part of the rest of the cast was just as bad as Bryniarski's. Kelsey McCann looks wholly confused and unsure through the entire movie while Wes Ramsey, from Kentucky, struggles mightily with his Irish accent. For the longest time, I didn't even realize he was doing an accent. I started off thinking ""Wasn't Stoker Irish?"" Then when he was referred to later in the movie as an Irishman, well I just felt bad for Ramsey.

At the end of this movie, I'm left feeling not really sure what to think. The tone was deadly serious, but everything about it was just so bad I can't believe the movie was meant as anything but a deadpan spoof of an actual Dracula movie. I want to think their intentions were good, but come on!

I admit I'm not very neighborly to begin with, but this is one guest that is most definitely and absolutely NOT welcome here.",1343606400,,4831,4.612339930151339
8274165,1,B0019K4YSO,"Sai, Royce, Kerra and Eric are four pretty people living together in a loft in LA (and by pretty I mean they're not that pretty, but I'm guessing they were supposed to be). Sai is an artist, while Royce is her unofficial photographer. Eric is the carefree one who gets his share of the rent wherever he can, while Kerra . . . I don't know, her character was never really developed. Anyway, as 2009's BLED opens, everyone is attending a gallery showing of Sai's latest collection. A mysterious stranger, Renfield, shows interest in a piece and Sai invites him back to the loft to see her newest newest paintings. It's there where Renfield tells Sai about this crazy new drug he's got. It's the bark from a very rare tree, and it's covered in little red pustules that, when cooked, emit a smoke that, once inhaled, takes the user on a wild ride.

He invites Sai to try it and because Renfield has told her this drug will open her mind, she says why not. What the drug actually does is transports Sai's mind to a creepy enchanted forest in a dream reality where she is stalked by an incubus who looks just like Royce--the true object of Sai's affections.

The next day, Renfield is gone, but he's left his twig behind, and when Sai tells the others about it, she explains artists and writers use absinthe to spur their creativity, and this drug is like a super form of that. This was the educational part of the movie because I had no idea I'd been doing it wrong all these years. Silly me, I've been trying to write using my ACTUAL imagination and, hopefully, talent. Now I know, and knowing is half the battle.

Anyway, she offers some to the gang, but only Eric, the carefree one, is eager to try it. He likes what he sees and ends up stealing a bit of the twig from Sai. Meanwhile Sai tells Royce how she feels about him and Royce, the dense one of the group who sees what's going on, knows something's not right with Kerra or with Sai, but turns a blind eye, confesses his love for her, too.

The truth of the matter is, the more of the drug Sai takes, the more trips to the creepy enchanted forest and the more encounters with the incubus that lives there, the further Sai slips into that reality, becoming a succubus herself.

In the end, Renfield shows back up to reveal his master plan. Draw the incubus into the real world so he can steal its blood and extend his own mortal life. And all it costs is the lives of the four not really that pretty people from the loft.

Will love win out and keep Royce and Sai together? Will Royce ever open Kerra's bedroom door and discover she's been lying dead in there for the past few days? Will Eric finally get his act together and get a job? Will I ever in my entire life, even if I lived to be 100, have cause to watch this movie again?

That last answer is a hell no.

BLED is written by Sxv'leithan Essex (hey, I'm just reporting it as it is in the credits) and directed by Christopher Hutson, who had an uncredited role in the X-FILES pilot as well as one in DIAGNOSIS MURDER before going on to write and direct such classics as DARK REALITY and BUTCHER HOUSE, and if BLED is any indication of the kind of pace and bad editing that comes from either of these two, I think I'm good as far as seeing any more of the movies they've worked on.

At only 95 minutes, BLED felt more like 150. Every scene just dragged on and on, as if the actors had all taken huge doses of Robitussin just before shooting. And then the film was slowed down after being coated in honey and syrup. I got so bored I ended up playing two or three games of pool on my phone, and I didn't miss one detail.

Essex's script isn't bad, but the smarminess of the actors coupled with the viewer having to pretty much guess at what's going on stifle what little enjoyment this movie may have offered. And the third act just dissolves into a mess of incomprehensibility the likes of which I've seldom seen before. I don't know where the writer and director were during the screening of their movie, but obviously they think it makes a lot more sense than it does. In fact, what little I was able to discern of the plot I got from reading the back of the DVD case and the IMDB synopsis. And I read those before I saw the movie, so I can only imagine how little sense it would have made had I gone into it cold.

The movie is set in two primary locations, the loft apartment and the creepy enchanted forest, and both sets were constructions, and obviously so. The forest scene is shot so as to disguise just how small the space really is, and the loft is shot in bedrooms only, no common area is ever established--in fact we really only see Kerra's, Sai's and Eric's bedrooms. For all I know Royce sleeps on the couch or in the tub or on the floor. Maybe Royce never sleeps. Don't know. Don't care. I'm just glad it's over. The problem is, this lack of establishment makes the characters feel less like real people and more like characters in a badly-constructed movie. Which is exactly what they are, granted, but still...

BLED was one long, boring nightmarish mess of a movie. I'm sure the intentions were good, but the execution was just sloppy and embarrassing. This isn't even a movie I'd recommend on cheese merits alone, it's just bad.",1343606400,,5257,4.325888324873096
