The show features Chloe playing dress up and pretending to be an Ice Skater, Snow Princess, Ice Hockey Player, and Snow Skier.  She has fun adventures and the show is wholesome cuteness any young child would enjoy!  There is counting, creative play and friends.",1323475200,4,354,4.5

4531707,5,B0052W9UYI,"We have been watching ""Chloe's Closet"" on PBS Sprout for a while. Just ordered the new DVD and my daughters (ages 5 and 3) were absolutely thrilled to see this fun video! Chloe is a very imaginative little girl who goes on several adventures with her friends Jet, Tara, and her ""lovey"" called carrot. My daughters love to dress-up and relate to the fun adventures. Especially the ice skating and snow angel winter themes!! A great buy for four episodes.",1318291200,2,453,4.675
4531708,5,B0052W9UYI,I received Chloe's closet as a gift for my 3 year old daughter and she absolutely loved it! She thought Chloe was the loveliest girl ever and thoroughly enjoyed all the adventures she and her friends had.  Dressing up and tea parties are all her favorite things so I think she could relate. She also has a blankie that goes everywhere with her so enjoyed seeing Chloe carry around lovely carrot!  I will definitely buy this for lots of her friends as birthday gifts.,1318032000,2,466,4.535714285714286

Not only does it hit the age demographic right on the nail it is full of fun and imagination. It has counting, shapes, things to make and most of all lovely imaginative stories. My daughter could sing the theme song after a couple of views. THIS IS AN UNSPOILED GEM OF A SHOW.",1317254400,,412,4.227848101265823

8454547,5,B0052W9UYI,"One of the greatest animated TV shows of all time, and it's really cute, too. I especially think Chloe, the main character is the cutest. This show also airs on the Sprout channel. Chloe's friends are some of the cutest side kick characters in any animated TV show! The magical adventures and songs are all well done in this show. This show has loads of fun, every episode on this DVD! Best animated TV show next to Make Way for Noddy!  There's northing contrived about this at all. Two big thumbs ups! I highly recommend this show for young kids!",1430524800,,547,4.47

8454549,5,B0052W9UYI,Chloe is an imaginative little girl who encourages everyone to play along with her. The episodes are about 20 minutes long and don't make parents feel guilty for using the TV as a brief babysitter. My almost three-year-old daughter also really enjoyed the bonus music video.,1397001600,,274,4.978260869565218
