8177325,4,B000NDIAOW,"The Full Frame documentary shorts collections always provide an array of interesting perspectives and innovative approaches to the documentary film. The films include:

""Afloat""--a unique take on old age.

""The Angelmakers""--about a group of women in Hungary who murdered their husbands in the 1920s, becoming somewhat legendary.

""High Plains Winter""--a beautiful and surprising look at the West in winter.

""Send Me Somewhere Special""--a personal journey of English conversations.

""Stand Like Still Living""--African bushmen dealing with AIDS crisis--particularly affecting for those who recall with affection the film ""The Gods Must Be Crazy.""

""The Intimacy of Strangers""--an new use of cell phone conversations.

All in all, once again, a collection well worth viewing.",1181260800,,774,5.918918918918919
