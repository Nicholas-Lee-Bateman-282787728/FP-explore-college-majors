4171421,5,B003QP4CZA,"Pawn Stars, regardless of the episode, just plain rocks.  Interesting, informative, and entertaining as hell.  You get to learn quite a bit of trivia and random facts about a wide range of things including antique firearms and other random weapons, classic cars, Americana, pop culture, memorabilia, etc. while being exposed somewhat to the family dynamic of the Harrison family and sidekick Chumlee in this family owned Las Vegas pawn shop.  This shop takes in quite a few unique items not typical to a pawn shop, always consulting a never ending parade of colorful character-experts to authenticate and value items.  The only complaint I have is that I've watched all of the episodes and they don't make new ones fast enough.",1295395200,3,727,5.033333333333333

It puts itself out there as a ""reality"" show, and they show customers browsing the store which are actors, people ""selling"" things that they turn around and take home after the show is over, conversations that are entirely pre-scripted and rehearsed, even fake sunlight coming through the front door (the show is filmed in the back of the building AT NIGHT (after the real pawn shop is closed to the public).

4171484,2,B003QP4CZA,"As i have reviewed other seasons of this show...the show's content is very good and interesting but what I despise is the pre-scripted meetings and outcome of the deals.
Stop making us trying to believe that everything is off the cuff! These deals have already been decided on BEFORE it's filmed for us. The producers try and put you on the edge of your seat when a final offer has been made and they have a 10 second pause (with music building)before the customer agrees to the deal. And 9 times out of ten he accepts the offer.
My favorite is when a customer(s) says he's not going to accept anything less than $3K for his item. The Pawn guys offer him $300 and he accepts it gladly and ends up being very happy with the $$.
Or when Corey says he's made a $20K deal without his Father knowing it and hopes it comes out o.k...You know damn well that his Father know's everything about the deal.
Stop trying to make the general public feel that this is all ""live"" and happening as we see it.",1413676800,,991,4.304812834224599

These Folks are the type that Look for the BEST DEAL and Want Full Retail for something that they picked up at the Garage Sale for next to FREE, yet when it comes to the Pawn Stars providing a Service and Making Money, they refer to the Pawn Stars as Thieves....unbelievable.",1407369600,,541,4.454545454545454
4171503,3,B003QP4CZA,"What is interesting to me are the items that people bring in to have pawned.  Often times one can learn about history through the memorabilia and every day items that one sees on the show.  Also, experts are brought in to confirm if a piece is real or a fake which is also quite instructive.  One also learns that pawn shop is probably not the place to take an item to sell, if you want to sell it for the full value.

One disturbing aspect of the show is the way the character ChumLee is abused by the owners.  It is a little hard to tell if disparaging comments and verbal abuse is just part of the script, to try to make the show entertaining or if they are a real aspect of the work environment.  Whatever the case, it does not look pretty.  I took two stars off my rating because work place abuse, in a so called ""reality"" show, is just not funny.",1407196800,,852,4.127272727272727

I enjoy that part of the show and it is what keeps me watching.  I do NOT enjoy how over time they have started to ""play up"" the roles of ""characters"" and their petty and stupid issues with one another.  I could care less whether Chumlee gets a raise or if Rick builds a doghouse for his step daughter's dog.  I don't know why the maker's of these shows don't stick with what makes people watch to begin with, but waste the viewers time with trivial garbage that we don't care about.  As long as the items that come in continue to be interesting, and they don't spend too much time on these ""side stories"", I will watch, but if the show continues to focus on the side stories more than the items being brought in to sell, then I will find some other way to pass my time.",1403308800,,1012,4.142857142857143

What different is the Staff and Experts that can make informed decisions to come to a realistic price with the seller. I think the haggling aspect is of interest in what ever setting.

4171538,5,B003QP4CZA,Funny and very educational at the same time.  Great family show. Would recommend to watch this show as a family.,1397088000,,112,4.6
4171539,4,B003QP4CZA,This is a great way to become familiar with valuable items and get a sense of their value.  The antics of the staff add an entertaining element.  This show is family friendly unlike another that has deteriorated into sleazy moments and acrimonious family feuding.,1396569600,,263,4.954545454545454
4171540,5,B003QP4CZA,I love pawn stars so I like this season the same as the others. If you like reality tv then you should like pawn stars.,1396396800,,119,3.8
4171541,5,B003QP4CZA,"I watch this show pretty much constantly when I'm at home looking for some background noise.

I really like watching the show as it shows a lot of really interesting information without going into too much detail.

The guys are definitely a huge reason as to why this show is as successful as it is, the personalities keep you wanting to see more from them.

So far as watching this on Amazon... total pain in the ass. The episodes are only about 20 minutes, but there is no auto-continue like there is on Netflix for watching a series. Meaning, when I have this up on the TV I have to get up every 20 minutes (or stop cooking or whatever I'm doing) to continue on. It shouldn't be that difficult Amazon, get with the times.",1395964800,,724,4.348148148148148

4171543,4,B003QP4CZA,This was a good pawn stars it was all about the stuff people brought in. With experts coming in to tell more about an item. Better than when they do goofy personal conflict sub-plots that mostly seem made up.,1394928000,,208,4.358974358974359
4171544,4,B003QP4CZA,Great way to learn about the stuff that people have around their house and what the history is. I love the guys that restore old stuff too!,1394323200,,139,4.185185185185185
4171545,5,B003QP4CZA,I look forward to seeing more episodes. The Pawn Stars shows are entertaining and the people are all American families. The show makes me wonder about living in Las Vegas and a job at the Pawn Shop.,1393545600,,198,4.378378378378378
4171546,5,B003QP4CZA,"Personally, I enjoy watching pawn stars. It reminds me of the PBS show Auction Roadshow or perhaps the Price is Right game show where one attempts to guess the price of the item. For me that's fun. Also the family running the pawn shop are pretty animated...they keep it entertaining.",1393545600,,284,4.7
4171547,4,B003QP4CZA,"Others have mentioned this isn't the whole of season 3, which is too bad. But it has some fun episodes, and I just like these guys.",1393372800,,131,4.076923076923077

4171553,5,B003QP4CZA,"Rick, Huas, Chumly, & the old man, make up a very campy display of success in the pawn business.
It's almost like a Soap box, as apposed to a reality show.
Extremely entertaining series.

4171555,4,B003QP4CZA,"The show is set up, but it is still very fun.  I do get tired of the fighting but the history of the things people bring in is really cool.  You will learn and have fun all at the same time.",1389657600,,190,3.6097560975609757
4171556,4,B003QP4CZA,"I enjoy history and some of the items brought into the pawn shop have a wonderful backstory.  I guess Chumlee is there for comic relief - otherwise I am not certain why anyone would employ him.  I usually watch a 2 or 3 episodes, but fortunately watching it via streaming allows me to fast forward through some of the un-interesting segments but I am certain what is un-interesting to me might be a great interest to others.  Worth a look-see.",1389398400,,443,4.5125
4171557,5,B003QP4CZA,Still enjoying the guys and I really like the history lesson on the stuff brought in.  Some time wonder if you would really see the guys if you went to the store,1389225600,,161,4.03125

4171559,5,B003QP4CZA,"I TV-Love this show! Just like Rick says, ""Ya never know what is going to walk in that door""--and, for the record--it would never be the same without Chumley! I also really like the experts they bring on--especially for old books and for general history memorabilia. Fun!",1388880000,,271,4.787234042553192
4171560,5,B003QP4CZA,I bought this for a Christmas gift to exchange at the office party.  The name alone gave them a laugh and some of the folks  have seen the shows as I have and this  went over big.,1388880000,,179,3.7837837837837838
4171561,5,B003QP4CZA,These guys crack me up. Don't know if I could stand being in their store working but then I don't have to. Good series but now I need a break from them.,1388188800,,152,3.78125
4171562,5,B003QP4CZA,"We are Pawnaholics & always watch the show. But it does get annoying when there are only 2 Disc sets & these are a continuation of 2010's beginning with Trail Breaker & ending with Getting a Head (with that sweet Buick Skylark!) Writing A&E & History are a waste of time as they never respond. Be that as it may as we say: if you enjoy the show, you'll Luv these classics!",1388016000,,372,4.180555555555555
4171563,5,B003QP4CZA,Love this show. I have learned about antiques and collectibles. These world of pawn shops is facilitating to me. Enjoy.,1385856000,,119,5.0
4171564,3,B003QP4CZA,Pawn Stars is still entertaining BUT the show is starting to look a little too scripted for reality television. The  things people are bringing in are still cool though.,1383091200,,169,4.827586206896552
4171565,4,B003QP4CZA,These men are entertaining and knowledgeable. Their show brings together seller and buyer in such a way that you can relate to both.,1378339200,,132,4.782608695652174
4171566,3,B003QP4CZA,This show sort of grows on you. It's a good way to kill 22 mins. ChumLee has an appeal. I hope you continue to support the series.,1377820800,,130,3.8518518518518516
4171567,4,B003QP4CZA,"Poor Chumlee, not very bright.  But, I think the non-brightness is supplemented by a little 420 action.  And, the doofy ski hat looks ridiculous on him.  But, the show is everything you love about Pawn Stars.  History, experts, weird items, negotiations, etc.",1377734400,,259,5.095238095238095
4171568,5,B003QP4CZA,The family drama is hilarious and keeps me watching- But mostly I love all the history behind the items. Such a fun way to learn!,1377734400,,129,4.2
4171569,5,B003QP4CZA,I love to watch people negotiate prices on this show. It is something I have never had a knack for. It's always interesting to see the kinds of things people bring in to sell. This is a very enjoyable show.,1377388800,,206,4.175
4171570,5,B003QP4CZA,"Not to mention bartering skills you learn.  The have a good formula, but may need to consider revising or remaking some of their stock shot and patterns.  Sometimes they say the exact same thing, almost where I could quote them before they say it.

Last year I met the Lady who was selling the Car in a particular episode. She's from Chapin and a lot of class. She told me about the trip to Vegas and the story behind the sale. I decided to watch that episode and found it amusing.",1373760000,,473,4.5

4171597,3,B003QP4CZA,"Pawn Stars is one of my favorite shows. Always so intriguing, the things that they come across. What made me choose such a low score was the Amazon app itself. During all episodes I watched, plus movies I watched, the app would always close mid way throughout the episode and show my desktop. I would have to resume episode, only for it to do it again a few minutes later. That becomes VERY annoying and totally ruins my viewing experience. I wish they would come up with an update to eliminate this bug soon. I'm a big fan of Amazon Prime...but this issue is quickly changing my mind.",1368921600,,585,4.425925925925926

4171601,5,B003QP4CZA,"When I first watched this show, I had the wrong impression of Pawn shops and the purpose them. I mistakenly believed that Pawn Sops take advantage of desperate people in desparate times.  These guys are just the opposite, they are faced with a Wide Variety of items and have to decide what to pay for them so that they can turn a profit. They are always upfront with the sellers and in some cases the seller finds out that their item is worth more (10X ) than they thought. This knowledge was brought to them by the Pawn Shop owners.  This is a excellent example of how honesty in business yields win win for buyer and seller. In addition every show is an education on mostly items that I never realized even existed, much less were worth CASH MONEY.",1368576000,,750,4.388489208633094

4171632,5,B003QP4CZA,I love this show. The owners of the shop provide the viewers with brief history lessons. Chum lee is my favorite employee.,1362182400,,122,4.590909090909091
4171633,4,B003QP4CZA,"I enjoy this series, and each episode is very short, only about 23 min or so, and it is easy to have on in the back ground.",1361836800,,123,3.5925925925925926
4171634,3,B003QP4CZA,"After watching 40 or more episodes I have learned to dislike the characters/owners. Visiting experts appear biased; ""what are your concerns?"".",1361836800,,142,5.809523809523809

4171641,4,B003QP4CZA,"Me: I am not an expert in stars but I have a buddy that is. Let me call him over here and we can see how many stars Pawn Stars Season 3 is worth.
Expert: This is a genuine good show. Definitely worth five stars.
Me: So its worth 5 stars but the best I can do is 3. In today's market stars are not cheap. Plus I need to fix it up because it is in rough condition.
Rick: How about we meet in the middle at 4.
DRUM ROLL
Me: Alright you have a deal.",1360454400,,445,3.597938144329897
4171642,4,B003QP4CZA,I have really enjoyed all seasons of this show. It is a fun way to learn a little bit of history while entertained.,1360454400,,115,4.043478260869565

4171645,5,B003QP4CZA,"Okay, people, I completely admit to being a Pawn Stars addict!!!  I started watching this show a couple of years ago and I'm now truly addicted to it!  I'm a history buff and it's amazing just how much history you learn from a show about people pawning stuff - seriously.",1352851200,,271,4.4
4171646,4,B003QP4CZA,"I have to wait for the show to come out on DVD for the next season, but I can't wait.",1348185600,,85,3.3
4171647,4,B003QP4CZA,Good show but like other reviewers have said I have seen most of the episodes and they don't give you enough episodes.  Would have liked to seen the whole season of episodes,1337644800,,173,4.40625
4171648,3,B003QP4CZA,"This is a fantastic show, and I'm hooked on every episode. It's interesting to see what people have, and they stories they bring in with their piece that want to sell or pawn. That being said, be careful. This is VOLUME three, and not all of season three. If you take a quick look, you'll see ""three"", and one might think it's the full season of Season 3, it's not. It's just some episodes from Season 3. If you go into it knowing that, you should be fine.

I really like seeing how Rick, The Old Man, Corey, and Chumlee interact with each other.

If you've seen the show, or Seasons 1 and 2, you know what to expect and won't ' be disappointed.",1336780800,,645,4.193548387096774
4171649,5,B003QP4CZA,"I absolutely LOVE this show.  It is far and above the other ""copies"".  My DVD arrived in a reasonable amnt. of time in excellent condition.  Pawn Stars is presented by REAL people (they feel like ""kin""), and the show is the most fun I've ever had with history. This is a good seller I will order from again. Charlotte from Tennessee",1334534400,,332,4.409836065573771
4171650,2,B003QP4CZA,"I initially enjoyed this show but as I watched it, I found that it was repetitive and difficult to swallow.  So many of the items that come in on this show are just not believable as just popping up for some pawn broker to buy.  Also, as a resident of Las Vegas, I found that the people running this store are shockingly rude and full of themselves.  Overall, fun to watch for a few episodes but lacks any real staying power.  No idea how it has made so many seasons.",1331683200,,467,4.155555555555556
4171661,3,B003QP4CZA,"Great show, Just beware that this is not the whole season 3 like the first 2 they came out with this is just a few of the shows. So save your money and look for the whole season else where.",1326240000,4,189,3.75
4171662,3,B003QP4CZA,"I love the show it self, and couldn't wait to have my own copy of Season 3, but this is the ""best"" of season 3. This was advertised incorrectly.",1319760000,14,144,4.0
4171663,4,B003QP4CZA,"What I enjoy about the DVDs is there are no commercials.  That seems to cut an episode down to about twenty minutes.  And, I always like watching the good old boys wheel and deal in merchandise which is often a sight to behold. Unfortunately, this set is not the complete season and I have no idea who the fans were that made the selection of their favorites. I would have preferred the entire season with the option of skipping over a clunker episode.  Still, you have to appreciate what you get.",1319673600,,497,4.43956043956044
4171664,1,B003QP4CZA,"yep, like they did with American Pickers Season 2 History Channel decided to release Pawn Stars as a ""Volume"" for Season 3 instead of an entire Season 3. WHY?? I've tried getting an answer out of them in regards to Pickers so I doubt they'd be any more forthcoming in regards to this show. I was looking forward to buying the Complete new Seasons of Pickers & Pawn Stars this month but I'll be saving my money instead.. seriously, who makes these decisions and why??",1319500800,10,466,4.4941176470588236
4171665,1,B003QP4CZA,After buying the first 2 FULL seasons on DVD I figured I could trust that this item was actually a full season. I would not have bought this half season had I known this was what was advertised.,1318896000,20,194,4.131578947368421
4171666,1,B003QP4CZA,"Buyer Beware !
