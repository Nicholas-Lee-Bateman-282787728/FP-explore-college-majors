8745256,5,B019HOVRSS,I liked the movie very much. It isn't as light hearted of a musical than I'm used to seeing with Jack Carson. There's much more drama and the story takes a sad turn here and there. But it does touch my heart. The role played by Ann Southern is great. She's just doing her best to keep her family together. The young man who plays the part of Jack Carson's son is just marvelous.,1483056000,,378,4.121621621621622

8745258,3,B019HOVRSS,"I expected a musical but there is little music in it. In fact, it is a bit boring. I do not recommend it to any one. I give it three stars because there are some good portions, especially the ones with the kid performing.",1462752000,,221,4.045454545454546
