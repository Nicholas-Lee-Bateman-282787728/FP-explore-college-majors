8131020,5,B000GETUBK,THIS is the DVD set you gotta have if you want the BEST version of 1980's VIRUS available! Worth every penny spent to get it. The movie is much better in it's uncut form!  Example.....In this version the President is still alive when the General barges in and demands to activate the ARS. Once the demand is made the President gives him a few choice words then he dies.

8131022,5,B000GETUBK,"a great collection.  Virus alone is worth the 3 pack.  the other two movies are great, though i would have loved to have the international cut of Bullet Train.  Golgo 13 is classic.",1391040000,,181,4.424242424242424
8131023,5,B000GETUBK,"I bought this 3-pack mainly for the movie - ""Virus"". The other 2 movies - ""Golgo 13"" and ""Bullet Train were good too, but the main draw was ""Virus"". This is the full-length original version as it should be seen! All the characters are given a good presentation. It was not too butchered like the other so-called International releases. ""Virus"" is a great movie and everyone should see it at least once.",1329696000,,402,4.597222222222222
8131024,5,B000GETUBK,"I AM SO GLAD THAT THEY HAVE FINALLY TREATED KINJI FUKUSAKA'S film,""VIRUS,""with the honor and respect that it deserves! As
some of the other reviewers have pointed out this is the actual
fully-restored,136 minute cut of the film! It isn't like all of
those awful,heavily-butchered versions of the film that you've
seen both previously on VHS and DVD!The 136 minute cut of the
film captures the true beauty and epic feel to the film. Not only
that,it really adds a HECK of a lot more meat to the story and
fleshes out all of the characters in more dramatic depth that has
been completely missing from the other butchered versions of the film!
THE BULLET TRAIN is another awesome film just like VIRUS!And what
everyone else has said is true! The American film,""SPEED"",blatantly
stole its plot from this one! THE BULLET TRAIN is in widescreen format
just like VIRUS.However,BCI/ECLIPSE was only able to include the English
dubbed U.S. version cut of the film. Not that I mind the English dubbing
by any means. I was still totally glued to my seat while watching THE
BULLET TRAIN!I'm still hoping,however,that one day BCI/ECLIPSE will
release the complete Japanese cut of the film on DVD with English
subtitles. The only reason why I'm not able to write a review on GOLGO
13 is because I just haven't had a chance to watch it yet. But hopefully,
I will soon!",1243987200,5,1353,4.737288135593221
8131025,3,B000GETUBK,"Hey the real find in this collection is the full international release of the 1980's Apocalyptic survival tale "" Virus "" released in the USA in a edited confusing edition, and never released here in a official unedited version that restores the complex and exciting tale of survival. Well if that bothered you, then here it is, a pretty decent print to boot and no goofy overseas sub-titles to distract. Two other films are thrown in as a bonus "" Golgo 13"" and "" Bullet Train "" both very entertaining. A must have collection for "" Virus "" fans and those who admire Sonny Chiba's cool martial arts vibe.",1213833600,5,602,4.532110091743119
8131026,5,B000GETUBK,"Yes, the version of 'Virus' on disc 1 of this 3-disc set IS the full-length Japanese version, presented in an excellent widescreen print. The picture quality is WAY better than any previous DVD release - although that's not difficult when previous editions have looked more like worn-out rental VHS tapes than professional DVD releases! :)

The Japanese-language scenes have removable English subtitles and, as with most director's cuts, the story feels far more complete in this long version. Those who are familiar with the shorter, strictly chronological 'international' cut may be quite surprised when this version opens with the submarine approaching dead Tokyo ... before flashing back several years to explain how the entire world came to be a graveyard. The long version of 'Virus' is a quite different, ultimately much more powerful cut of a film you may think you already know.

If, like me, you were seeking the full-length 155 minute version of 'Virus' then look no further - here it is.

Hey, as a bonus, you get two other films too!

'Golgo 13' is the 1977 Japanese film 'Golgo 13 : Kowloon Assignment' and is presented in 2.35:1 with a choice of either the original Japanese soundtrack plus English subtitles ... or a so-bad-it's-almost-funny dubbed English soundtrack.

'Bullet Train' (1975) is, as many people have pointed out, blatantly where 'Speed' (1994) stole its plot from. It's in 2.35:1 and is the US theatrical version with a run-time of 115 minutes. Your only audio option is English-dubbed, but luckily the dub-job is far better than on 'Golgo 13' - in fact, even dubbed into a foreign language, the Japanese actors manage to be less wooden than Keanu Reeves was in the unofficial remake. The original Japanese cut of 'Bullet Train' ran for 152 minutes but, in contrast to 'Virus', the concensus of opinion seems to be that the shorter run-time here is merciful rather than regrettable.",1160524800,24,1914,5.0062893081761
8131027,3,B000GETUBK,"Three flicks, and one with Sonny Chiba in the main role. Golgo 13 (the aforementioned main role) was rockin' and worth a watch. In Virus Chiba is in a supporting role but surprisingly the movie overall isn't that bad. The worst of the bunch was Bullet Train, in which he goes from supporting role to a token role, and I didn't care for it at all. If you're a real Chiba fan and already own Golgo 13 I'd not mess with this unless you're the type of person who must have a complete collection of each and every single title in which Chiba had a role.",1158105600,2,548,4.179245283018868
