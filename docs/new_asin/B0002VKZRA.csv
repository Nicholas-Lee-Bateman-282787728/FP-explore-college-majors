8557376,1,B0002VKZRA,"The description on the back of this DVD is what convinced me to buy it (and the 2003 copyright), but I could swear that the DVD inside had NOTHING to do with either the copyright, the photos on the outside of the DVD or the description! It almost seems as if the DVD was switched! First, it is very poor quality and appears to have been filmed in the instuctor's home. Second, the instructor is obviously not pregnant and does not seem to tailor the exercises in any way toward pregant women. The video seems like it was probably filmed in the 80's (the outfits are a great indicator!) and no effort was made to make it look even slightly professionally produced. This DVD was painful to watch and even more painful to try to follow without falling asleep!",1157932800,2,756,4.446043165467626
8557377,1,B0002VKZRA,"i have never encountered such terrible quality from a so called shop bought dvd it was very fuzzy in fact i have seen clearer pirate copies of dvds compared to this. the actual 'production'

looks as though it was made in the 80's but has been copied to dvd to make it more up to date. the level of fitness required to take part in this is not an issue someone in traction could do it! it appears to me that she has filmed it in her front room and asked her friend to video it i have home family shot videos with better technique. i am very disapointed in this dvd it was a total waste of time and money i just hope others will read this before being cought out by purchasing it. now i find i cant return it just to add insult to injury",1108425600,6,736,3.972972972972973
8557378,1,B0002VKZRA,"Don't buy it!!! It's a complete waste of money. Even though the DVD version was released in October of 2004 (don't be fooled by the picture on the box), the material on this DVD is at least 10 years old and really outdated. This yoga DVD must have also been done on a really low budget since it looks like it was recorded in someone's apartment. There is no music during the exercises, which makes the workout even more boring. I couldn't even watch the whole thing, and I am definitely not exercising to this DVD.",1100217600,14,514,4.364583333333333
