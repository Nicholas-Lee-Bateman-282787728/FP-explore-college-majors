8254814,4,B0014A89I0,I am a UK fan. Not as big as some but I wanted to have this game because I went to school with one of the Kentucky players in high school. I very much enjoyed this purchase because I just like being able to go back and watch this game from time to time. If you are an Kentucky fan you'll enjoy this,1360281600,,298,3.746031746031746

He'd love to have the 1984 NCAA final game if anyone knows if it is available.",1292889600,,168,4.090909090909091
