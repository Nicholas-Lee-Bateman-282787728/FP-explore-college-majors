5971912,1,B00F9IB1M4,"Most likely going to be 16:9 cropped. Shame on you Funimation.
If you put the level set material as season sets it would have sold well.",1381363200,25,136,4.269230769230769
5971913,1,B00F9IB1M4,"Have you ever noticed how every set of Dragonball Z episodes Funimation puts out isn't ""perfect""? There's always something missing or wrong. The original releases weren't organized and didn't have the funimation dub for the first seasons, the ""ultimate uncut special edition"" had a weird score and got discontinued, The orange season sets were cropped and missing footage, the Dragon Box sets were missing the Faulconer score, the Kai sets were missing...everything, now we're back to putting out sets with missing footage again. The only perfect sets they put out so far were the ""level"" blu ray sets, but those were cancelled after 2 releases.

I believe Funimation is doing this on purpose, so they can keep producing new sets and scamming people into buying all the different sets. I would encourage all fans of this show to avoid this and avoid ALL SETS until they are absolutely PERFECT, with EVERYTHING included. If you keep buying this stuff you're only encouraging them to do this to you over and over again. I'm sure after these sets come out they're going to put out a new full screen blu ray set with something else missing, then they'll have to make another one and that will be missing something, and so on. Enough is enough, don't buy it and they will finally give us what we want.",1381363200,30,1296,4.76
5971914,1,B00F9IB1M4,"In 2011, FUNimation released the very first Blu-ray remaster of the original Dragon Ball Z in its native 4:3 aspect ratio. This remaster, unlike 2007's ""Orange Brick"" sets, was actually... GOOD. Not perfect, mind you, but good. It was clean and wasn't screwed with. It even contained both the Japanese voice track, and the revised English voice track, with your option of two soundtracks; original Japanese or the American soundtrack. It was looking to be the definite Dragon Ball Z release that we've all been looking for. However, these dreams were crushed when FUNimation decided to cancel this production as it was becoming too costly.

This was the last we'd heard from FUNimation about Dragon Ball Z being in Blu-ray until we saw a survey posted earlier this year, asking fans about the Blu-rays once again! However, an interesting question was in the survey; one that would divide the fanbase: What should the aspect ratio be? Original 4:3, or Cropped 16:9? For those who do not know, 4:3 is the original format Dragon Ball Z is displayed in, otherwise known as the ""box format"" or Fullscreen. 16:9 is known as Widescreen. What FUNimation will be doing is they will be cutting off the tops and bottoms of the original screen in order to make it fit the wider screen. You will be losing 20% of the original footage. Granted, this time around they will be using a more useful method of cropping to make sure that nothing important is cut out, but still, it will not be the full image. This decision oddly perplexes me. Why would you forcibly crop your footage, when most TVs nowadays have the option to crop the footage for you? That way, you're not disappointing your other half of the fanbase.

Not only that, but this release will most likely not be as good as the Level sets, as that kind of remastering was too expensive.

Very disappointed in FUNimation for making this decision. Hopefully one day we'll see that definitive Dragon Ball Z Blu-ray set sometime down the line. Until then, I'll be holding onto my Dragon Boxes and my Kai Blu-rays for safe-keeping.",1381276800,89,2071,4.747222222222222
5971915,1,B00F9IB1M4,"I am very happy to know that Dragon Ball Z was released in high definition again, but it is out of the question for me to buy it if it was cropped to 16/9.",1381190400,32,155,3.588235294117647
5971916,1,B00F9IB1M4,"Many people were excited for Funimation to finally release an affordable, complete set of DBZ with good quality on Blu-ray. With the announcement of a 16:9 aspect ratio, many people including myself were disappointed. By cropping DBZ from 4:3 to 16:9, you lose 20% of the footage. Nobody should support this release, it's not worth it.",1381104000,24,335,5.0
5971917,1,B00F9IB1M4,"Seriously Funimation, enough is enough.  You've ripped me off too many times by releasing part of a set and then cancelling it mid production.  Until the entire series is released, I'm not spending a dime.  I purchased the Ultimate Uncut Special Edition (cancelled mid production), I then sold those and bought the orange brick sets (terrible ""widescreen"" and filtering applied), you stopped selling the dragon box sets (the only ones that are actually decent), I purchased the Level sets (cancelled mid production, these were FANTASTIC), and then there's Kai which would be good, except you switched back to the original Japanese music for the US release near the end of the series which is just awful in my opinion.

Release the rest of the Level sets.  Stop doing this.  WTF is your problem?  I can guarantee that I am your target audience for this product.",1381104000,46,860,4.889655172413793
5971918,1,B00F9IB1M4,"I was excited for this release of Dragon Ball Z, especially since I was unable to obtain the 2nd Dragon Box set.  However one fact has changes my opinion greatly.  This release much like the season set ""orange bricks"" will be presented in a cropped 16:9 aspect ratio as opposed to the original 4:3 aspect ratio.  So basically you're losing about 20% of the screen.  That fact alone makes this whole release worthless, not to mention with the severely reduced price point and increased number of episodes compared to the original cancelled blu-ray release, I can't imagine the remastering will be that good anyway.

So stay away from this release, let Funimation know you don't want ""some"" of the picture you want ALL of the picture.",1380499200,37,732,4.777777777777778

5971921,5,B00F9IB1M4,It was great to watch this show in such good quality. Everyone else wants to complain about cropping but It really didn't effect my experience at all. You can still see ALL of the important things that you need too. Much better than the orange bricks. And I like my tv to be filled not limited to a 4:3 box.,1519862400,,307,4.133333333333334

Between the options of:
Orange Bricks, Blu-ray, and Dragon Boxes, go for the blu-rays if you're tight on money. Picture quality is not as great as the Dragon Boxes or the Level sets, but still better than the Orange Bricks.

However, Kai's dub is even better than the ocean dub here (so it goes kai>ocean>this one for this saga, or up until the fight with Jeice in season 2 of either) Every other season after this though get original DBZ english (funimation). You just find the chapter this ends with and continue from there with season 2 of DBZ. The dialogue and music in DBZ (funimation original dub) after this dvd/blu ray is far superior to anything else and contrary to how they marketed DBZ Kai it is also more adult.",1502150400,,612,4.473214285714286

5971940,5,B00F9IB1M4,It's more of a question does the DBZ blu ray box sets have the American background music and style like it was back on toonami and not have the Japanese background like it came from the dragonball series.,1496966400,,204,4.394736842105263

5971943,5,B00F9IB1M4,"This Blu-Ray collection of Dragon Ball Z is excellent.  While some feel that the 16:9 cropping is an issue, I feel that the footage has been carefully cropped and adapted into the HD format with the highest level of excellence and great care.  Watching the DBZ Blu-ray set feels like watching the show for the first time all over again.  The colors and lines pop in crisp 1080p, and multiple audio options allow for fans of varying dubs and scores to find an audio track that suits their preference.  This is a must own for fans of the franchise.",1495756800,,546,4.484848484848484
5971944,4,B00F9IB1M4,"I've collected every version of the series released so far and this one was certainly the best. Like the DVD sets it's been recropped. This time they did an even better job, making sure to crop less and also re positioning the frame so it doesn't come off looking off center. So if the cropping did bother you in the previous release, you should know this one is better. Also the missing lines that degraded the original are not an issue here, and the transfer is cleaner than ever. You've got three audio tracks, the US dub with Japanese Soundtrack, the US Dub with the broad cast music, and the original Japanese. Also the marathon feature is back which is a very nice plus. Really missed that in the Kai sets.

It should be noted that not everything good was carried over. This is the original cut of the original series so all the filler is there, for better or for worse, and it doesn't have the color corrections of the kai set, but it's DBZ as it was. This is Funimations redub of the saiyan saga that they did a few years back so you can listen to the same consistent voices uncut for the entire series, nothing has been changed on that front as far as I can tell. The disks are all in great shape as well, no defective disks thus far. Can't argue with the price, either.

For the money this is the best package of the series you could ask for, now if we could only get similar treatment for the original Dragon Ball or for the new Dragon Ball Super, then we'd be in business.",1495152000,3,1484,4.277580071174377

Though the picture is cropped, I never found it to take me out of the initial watching experience (And at the very least the cropping was done much much better than the orange brick releases) If I had to say one negative is the colors for certain things, like some characters, look really pale and the brightness is a tad high. Overall I still would prefer the level sets for HD (sadly canceled long ago) and the Dragon Boxes for it not being tampered with (out of print/rare to find them). However, this release does the job and despite certain issues, it as a product does what it needs to and makes Dragon Ball Z look good on HD tvs for a newer generation for a good price.",1488240000,,769,4.238095238095238

The quality looks darn good and I really enjoy the ""marathon"" option on the blu-ray. Watching in ""marathon"" mode skips the intro/outro and plays episodes back to back.

The bottom line is if you like DBZ and you don't have the collection then get the blu-ray. Don't stress so much over aspect ratios.",1484524800,2,594,4.2105263157894735

I saw a few reviews complaining that the aspect ratio isn't the same as the original, and that causes some of the footage to be cropped incorrectly. These claims are true, however, I have only really noticed that in the opening and closing credits of each episode. Without sitting side-by-side with the original 4:3 footage comparing the two at every frame, I find it highly unlikely that you will notice anything out of whack. If you did, I feel that it would be more humorous than inconveniencing, and by no means should it take away from the nostalgia. Another plus (from an art perspective), Seasons 1-3, 4-6 and 7-9 collage side-by-side with each in the set of 3 to make one panoramic scene involving the characters primarily from those sagas.

My review isn't based on memory as I watch half of the first season on my orange brick dvd's while I waited for the blu rays to come in. Whoa what a difference is all I have to say. While hardcore fans will swear by the graininess of the original DBZ I for one like the newest, latest, best. No knocks on them because we're all fans of this great series but the blu ray looks oh so crisp on my 55 inch 4k tv. The sound is also pretty amazing on my surround sound setup.

5972026,5,B00F9IB1M4,"I recently got into the Dragon Ball Series, and it's a very addictive series that I'm loving.

Though there are many complaints against FUNimation's full season releases of Dragon Ball Z, I'm going to give my own perspective.

First off, the thing I'd like to say is that I'd very much rather have a full screen release because cropping something initially done in fullscreen is just problematic. It irritated me greatly that they did that to the Original UK blu-ray sets of ""Thunderbirds"" back in 2008. But, I'm surprised at how well it transfers to widescreen when cropped properly (where as the Orange DVD sets are just awkwardly framed straight crops without any human touch). I'm somewhat pondering if the show was animated in open-matte (filming in fullscreen for a widescreen release) because if I weren't so video tech savy, I wouldn't know it were cropped. It may not be that far off since some of the movies were done in fullscreen but with widescreen cropping in mind.

The second thing I hear is about over-saturation of colors. The colors do have quite a pop, but I wouldn't say they're all that over-saturated. But my definition of over-saturation may be different from others. The contrast and color tones are really good and make it feel as if the show were animated not that long ago (still without losing that cell animated 1980's feel). The Dragon Box sets may be in fullscreen, but the color tones really bother me there; the blues are too strong and the skin tones are too pink. Minimal to no color correction on those.

The third is one I have to agree with, and that is the excessive DNR (Digital Noise Removal) in order to reduce grain on the film print. Now that concept I don't have a problem with, it's some of the unintended consequences. More subtle details are blurred/smeared due to DNR. You won't really notice the affects of it on close up shots or shots focused on the characters, but shots of characters from a far distance really seem to smear up and lose detail (even though those shots were slightly less detailed to begin with). And it takes a toll on the background paintings which are much more detailed. It doesn't bother me so much that it makes it impossible for me to watch, but as a video editor, it's kind of hard to ignore.

So, I have to say, the final product of the Blu-Ray isn't perfect, but I'd still recommend it. It depends on how bad the cropping bothers you, and if you're a hardcore DBZ fan, you've probably already sold all your bone marrow for the Dragon Box sets, so I don't need to say that you probably won't want to be buying this set. In comparison to what I've seen of the Dragon Box sets, the final quality of this set is miles better.",1451865600,,2702,4.551440329218107

While the reworked frames are pretty mostly, apparently these episodes are the completely reworked ones that aired on CN later, around the time of the Orange Brick sets if I remember correctly. That means that, just like any release, there will be many things added, retouched, or possibly removed compared to what might have been someone's previous viewing experience. While I was a bit disappointed that these were not entirely as I had previously watched on television, this is simply a matter of opinion and may not be as big of an issue for somebody else, or maybe even preferred over my viewing experience.",1428278400,,788,4.676258992805756

I am no expert at this kind of stuff and so reading those reviews that talked about aspect ratio and resolution just went over my head. I say that shamefully. But I need to know whether or not the Blu Ray version of Dragon Ball Z is going to suck worse just because it supposedly looks that much better than the original. I don't mind watching the old school version like what they have online at dragonballclub.net because it brings back a lot of memories of me and my brother watching it on TV back in the day. I wanted to buy this series, all nine seasons, because I wanted to have a part of my past relived and rekindled in my heart. I know it sounds corny but it's true. Can someone just tell me if it is worth it to get this series on Blu Ray and not those orange brick boxes? I bought the original Dragon Ball in those blue brick boxes and they were fine to me, maybe a lot more similar to the original but I liked watching it very much. Will it be a lot different if I choose the Blu Ray version? Will it completely lose its graininess? If it is widescreen, how much of whatever has been cut off matters to sticking to the original? If the orange brick boxes are more similar to the original then maybe I should return all my Blu Ray seasons and repurchase the brick ones instead.

5972128,5,B00F9IB1M4,"Being a ""hard core"" DBZ fan since a child, watching the series with subs in Japanese, then the Ocean dub, and finally Funimation Dub, I have to say this is the best way to experience DBZ. First thing I noticed was the quality. The colors are amazing, watching it on my 80 inch just about brings tears to my eyes how beautiful it looks. Everything is bright and crisp. The cropping is done very well, such a huge improvement over the big orange bricks (Own those too. The sound is fantastic, I've had no issues with these. The brick set I had to constantly adjust the volume, for some parts were way too low and others were just too extreme and loud. This release fixed that problem.  This also has the marathon mode which incase you don't know plays all the episodes on the disc without interruption, basically makes all the episodes one huge episode (or movie) if you want to see it that way.  You can change the audio to original Japanese, English with Japanese music, or English with the american music. And it also comes with subtitles, for those of you who want to experience it those ways. Over all these sets are amazing. I just hope they can do the same with the dragonball series, and hopefully re-release all the movies in a similar fashion. Also, the cases are the standard blurays so it won't take up a huge amount of space, unlike the orange bricks. It's just a thicker cases, due to them holding a lot of discs. I definitely recommend these to oldschool DBZ fans and people new to the series who want to experience the amazing world of Dragon Ball Z.",1411171200,6,1564,4.445993031358885

5972141,5,B00F9IB1M4,"When you're nine years old and DBZ is on tv and you got to stay home from school that day because you pretended to be sick so you can see Goku fight Vegeta everything is great. Everyone wants to be Goku when they're nine. Or maybe they want to be Gohan. But they want that strength. The ability to solve all their problems with punching. Someone mean? Punch them until either they die or they join you. No problem you can't defeat by working out more. Unhappy at home? Leave for a year so you can workout.

Turns out smashing your wife through a window is not a way to a happy family life. It's not something everyone stands around and laughs about, it's a thing where the cops. Come and arrest you and your wife spends a lot of time in a hospital and in the end she's no longer your wife and her friends hate you and you don't get to see your child anymore and you have to wonder where your temper came from.

Later in life maybe you see DBZ on TV again, and you watch Goku punch Buu really really hard and it solves all his problems. And you think of the time you tried that in a bar and it just ended with a crooked nose and bruised ribs and being thankful ey didn't just shoot you. Maybe you hunk about being nine again, watching dbz while you're home from school and you're eating hot ramen and your mom makes you sushi because she wants you to feel better and knows how much you love it. And as you sit drinking your cheap beer and whiskey in the middle of the day you wonder again where your temper came from and why you can't do anything right and man, you'd even settle for being Yamcha today.",1407196800,2,1602,4.131410256410256
5972142,5,B00F9IB1M4,"Beautiful set. I am not a purist so I do not have a problem with the cropped image.

If you are DBZ fan, you will not be disappointed.",1406678400,,263,4.28
5972143,5,B00F9IB1M4,"I have been wanting to buy a release of Dragon Ball Z for a few years now and I think this release is great. I'd like to clear up what the set doesn't have that I would have liked to have known beforehand.

- This has a Play All and a Marathon Play option, Play All, plays all the episodes on disc plus the credit openings/outros, and ""Last time on dragon ball z!"" intros. Marathon Play (which I think is really cool), only plays the credit opening and ""Last Time on Dragon Ball Z!"" once at the beginning of the disc and the outro credits at the end of the disc. This makes things a bit more cinematic and helps cut down time so you can sit an watch 10 episodes all in a row without having to skip ahead or watch something you've seen a bunch of times already. This cuts off about 45 minutes (Discs run about 4 hours through play all and 3 hours and 15 minutes through Marathon Play)

- No English subtitles for English dialogue. The only subtitles available are for the Japanese dialogue, which I don't understand because on my bluray player if I select subtitles manually it gives me 2 english options, when I select the first option it displays the Japanese to English translation and for the second option nothing appears. I don't know if the other seasons fixed this or not but I found that the case with Season 1

- For the first 2 seasons Bruce Faulconer hadn't done the music for Dragon Ball Z so what you get is the funimation score, from the Captain Ginyu saga (last few episodes of season 2 onward) Bruce Faulconers score takes the place of the second english option in the disc menus.

- The Japanese intros Cha La Head Cha La and the outro song is only on the Japanese mono track, whereas the first audio option clearly says ""English Dialogue with Japanese Music 5.1"". The actual music during the episodes is from the Japanese version, just the intro and outro is different.

- Also no ""Rock the Dragon"" song or opening on these sets.

- I would have liked Vegetas first appearance (Red hair, green armor) to have been color corrected to match how he looks throughout the rest of the series.

I consider myself a long time fan of Dragon Ball Z, I started watching Dragon Ball in Elementary School then I started collecting the VHS tapes. I eventually sold the tapes to buy the Orange Brick sets but relented at the last minute, once I found out about the awful cropping and colors. I got to borrow one from a friend and I found myself looking at all the imperfections and being critical of what got cut off from the cropping.

Later on I heard about the Dragon Box sets, I bought one of them but was disappointed that they had no english music and had become out of print (out of print = rare = more $$$).

I never actually heard of the level sets at the time they were being released, I don't think I had a bluray player at the time. If I had known I probably wouldn't have bought them, Averaging 17 episodes per release for 291 episodes, there would be 17 bluray sets, 17 bluray sets at $30 each would be $510 (I'm not sure how much the level sets were when they were released). $510 is a lot for a series with lots of filler episodes.

When I first heard that funimation was yet again re-releasing the series I was hoping for a set that had both the Japanese and English music, 4:3 cropping, and used the bluray format for HD visuals. This set delivers on all fronts except for the original 4:3 cropping. I held off for a long time for this very reason thinking it to be like my experience watching the first season of the orange bricks. I finally decided to buy this recently and I'm glad I did.

Yes this set is cropped, but it's not as badly cropped as the orange bricks. Funimation has done a decent job reframing the series this time around to include tops of heads and keeping what's important in the frame. I see a lot of reviewers bash this release for that reason alone but honestly once you start watching the episodes you don't notice anything is missing at all. It would have been great for the fans to receive the original 4:3 aspect ratio, but I find the new 16:9 cropped aspect ratio has ZERO impact on the story or how I remember it, so in my opinion it's a moot point, it would have been nice to have but a moot point nonetheless, though purists will say otherwise.

I've seen another reviewer give it low reviews because of how the camera panning is sloppy and how in some scenes it looks like they just moved the camera to fit the frame in, I went in expecting to see this happening at every turn I've only seen this ONCE while watching the first season, it was in the third episode or something (When Raditz and Piccolo are talking about the Dragon Balls and someone points at Goku, the camera does a quick pan down at Goku laying there) and I haven't seen it happen again. I think they may have been going for a dramatic effect but it did kind of look like they just moved the camera to get the scene back in frame again.  Also the grain from the original 16mm film source is gone which removes a lot of fine details and is noticeable when you watch the episodes.

Overall this set looks amazing, more modern as the slipcover suggests. The colors pop but are not overly saturated

Unless you are watching and comparing with the original 4:3 film format, you will always find something wrong with this release, whether it be the cropping, film grain that was taken out, or the colors. Enjoy it for what it is, a cleaned up ""HD restored"" version of Dragon Ball Z that will look great on your HDTV, the story is the same as you remember it and nothing in this release suffers from how Funimation has decided to present it. Compared to the previous releases this is the best version of Dragon Ball Z that is out right now, superior cropping from the orange bricks and audio options from the Dragon Boxes (Not counting the level sets because they aren't going to continue production on these). If you decide to purchase this set you won't be disappointed. At the price I don't see why not, if you find the cropping is too much for you, don't buy the rest.

I've also heard that this is the last release of Dragon Ball Z that Funimation is planning on doing, if this series does well, they will work on Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball GT bluray releases. Hopefully they decided to release these in the original 4:3 format. If Funimation does decide to rerelease DBZ it probably won't be for a few more years.

My suggestion? If you ABSOLUTELY don't want this cropped version check out the blu-rays of Dragon Ball Z Kai. DBZ Kai is meant to follow the manga more closely and they cut out all the extraneous filler episodes that plagued the original DBZ.",1406160000,,6679,4.351807228915662

They might do this for fear of losing money making something and not seeing a profit. Now  for the review just started watching this and it looks fantastic. This is  coming from someone who has  recently re watched some of the first season for something to compare this too. The cropping is not that bad not much image is lost like others have said maybe some of a characters hair or a toe that's it. The colors are vivid and look amazing  when compared to the what it looked like  when it first broadcast on tv. Its definitely worth a purchase for those who like Dragon Ball. Here is hoping  they decide to release  the original series  in much the same way after they finish the rest of the DBZ seasons.,1402617600,,901,4.341317365269461

If you're a fan and have been waiting for the blu-Ray, then buy these now!! I purchased the level sets thinking they were going to finish them but they didn't. They started making these, and now I purchased these seasons. I hope they don't stop making the seasons. I want them all in HD for once! Hurry up and buy!",1401321600,,663,4.346774193548387

The reason people or the fans did not want to get these season sets or disappointed by them is because the picture, or video is cropped. DBZ was made originally in 4:3 Aspect Ratio, and these season sets are in 16:9. But really the cropping is done right this time, unlike the terrible Orange Brick Sets. Honestly I really could not tell the this was cropped anyways. This is by far the best quality for DBZ ever. The quality alone is worth getting these season sets. Also You can watch the season sets with Japanese audio, Watch in in English with the Japanese music, or watch in English with the american Broadcast version, or Bruce Faulconer score or music. Honestly these seasons sets are worth every penny. It looks fantastic on Blu-ray. The best part is this is the original DBZ. Get these season sets. Just because the video is cropped does not mean it is bad, it is actually spectacular. I know its sucks its not in its original aspect ratio but these are just great.

5972160,4,B00F9IB1M4,"We all know about the ""problems"" presented in FUNimation's new season Blu-ray sets of DBZ - the DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) which removes all the blemishes and the 16:9 cropping. But in all honesty, they're not a major problem at all.
While I myself will admit that I would much rather have the series in its original 4:3 aspect ratio. But the way FUNimation has handled these sets is pretty impressive. They haven't just cut the top and bottom off the image like they did with the Orange Bricks DVDs. They've been selective with what gets cut off and occasionally use pan & scan to show various sections of a shot, which wasn't used on the Orange Bricks. While some may consider pan & scan an outdated technique, it's far better than what we had before.

I've seen some people claim that these sets are an ""abomination"" because of the cropping. That they tarnish the show's ""artistic integrity"" and that they tinker with the creator's ""vision"". That they're made specifically the ""12-year-olds or uninformed 20-something fan demographic who know nothing nor care about anything related to said concept"" (artistic integrity). That they're ""throwing money"" at these releases and therefore ""adding fuel for further future and potential controversies"" and that DBZ ""deserves better"".
What a load of rubbish. These sets look and sound incredible. Yes, the cropping is an issue. But it's such a minuscule issue that it can easily be ignored. You rarely miss out on anything anyway, besides maybe a few trees or a couple of rocks in the background, or other unimportant objects.
You can go on about the film grain that was present in the highly praised Level sets all you want. Just remember, grain is an imperfection. Not detail. It can also be extremely distracting, which is precisely what you don't want when watching a show like this. And no, I'm not one of those people that ""doesn't know anything about film."" DBZ wasn't ""shot on film"". It's an Anime, not a movie. It uses animation cels, and animation cels are supposed to be completely clean and have no dirt or grain on them whatsoever. These new Blu-ray sets achieve that. If you want to watch DBZ how it was originally shown, go buy the Dragon Boxes or Orange Bricks. You're welcome to them, because nobody else wants them. And if they do then they're kidding themselves. These new sets and DBZ Kai are the way to go.

""The Level sets were better"" I hear people say. Were they though? Really? FUNimation stopped producing them because they didn't sell well enough. No doubt partly because they were covered in meaningless grain.

So by all means buy these new sets. If we don't support the official release, then there won't be any future ones. FUNimation is a small company and cannot afford to produce future products if their existing ones don't make enough money. It's entirely the consumer's fault that the Level sets were cancelled. You only have yourselves to blame.",1398211200,2,2931,4.811507936507937
5972161,5,B00F9IB1M4,"So far I think this release has been well done, I'm almost done watching season 3. I don't notice the ""cropping"" but I do notice the extra landscape that you get with widescreen. If you can live with some well done trimming and getting an extra chunk on each side, then this is the release for you. It would have been nice if the list price was a bit lower. I know Funimation had a great sale on these but a lower starting price would have been nice.

If you want 4:3, buy the DVDs! I don't understand the 1 star reviewers complaining about the ""cropping"" and widescreen. No one is forcing you to buy this release!

5972164,5,B00F9IB1M4,"This has to be the best release of DBZ that has ever been released. The video is so crisp and clear. Sure the picture is cropped, but not as much as the Orange Bricks were. Plus, to be perfectly honest it really doesn't take anything away from the picture or overall quality of the presentation. Most of the distracting film grain and scratches have been removed. The colors are much more crisp and vibrant as ever. And the video fills the entire HDTV screen (unlike the Kai releases which had black bars on the sides of the TV) without stretching the picture.

The audio is nothing short of astounding. It will sound great on your home theater system or on stereoscopic headphones. I can't wait to hear what they have done with the Bruce Faulconer score on the other releases. My future reviews will go over this.

The extras are the same as you'd find on previous DBZ releases, but FUNimation promises that there will be over 6 hours of extra content via an on disk special feature ""sneak peak."" When I get around to reviewing those releases, I will comment more about them when I do.

All in all, I'd say this is the definitive version of DBZ that has ever been. Probably even better than Kai was. If you want to experience uncut DBZ perfection, then this release is for you. If you want a more fast paced version, go with DBZ Kai. Either way, you can't go wrong. Believe me I have both and never regretted my purchases.",1397088000,,1423,4.444444444444445

Remastered sound with the options of watching it with the original Japanese voice actors or the English dub with the old Japanese music or the american release.

The season sets however, went a different route, they selectively cropped it making it lose less of the essential image in certain situations.

In my opinion the best way to release this would have been to release it in 4:3 aspect ratio with this same look because it looks awesome and I was not a fan of the grainy look of the level sets. That being said this is not a bad buy unless you have the extremely expensive dragon box set.

That being said, it seems to me that some of the colors in some scenes have been adversely effected by whatever clean up process FUNimation used, and it's due to this and the cropping still being somewhat annoying in some scenes (though less so than the orange bricks) that I give this Blu-Ray edition 4 out of 5 stars.",1393113600,6,708,4.371212121212121

Problem #3:  Extreme loss of image detail due to no grain.

Anybody who has a Dragon Box Set, there is a way for you to watch it on widescreen tv without picture loss.

Here is how:

On your blu ray or dvd players,  you must change your display settings to 16:9 Full.

I'm glad I waited, this is a true widescreen transfer from the original 4:3 aspect ratio from the original footage, remastered frame by frame removing grain, dirt, tape marks, etc. If you read about fans complaining about the aspect ratio, which is 16:9, don't listen to them. Form your own opinion and decide for yourself. I think this is far superior to the Orange Brick sets. I highly recommend buying this beautiful remaster of the legendary DBZ once it becomes available. I have season 2 on the way as I'm writing this review and I can't wait to watch it!",1392940800,2,738,4.598484848484849

Yes, it's still ""cropped"" (actually, there IS extra information on the sides of the frame, so it's not just ""cropped"") but there isn't nearly as much cutting off of essential elements. The color is more accurate with the blue highlighting on Raditz's uniform being visible again and Goku's undershirt is blue like it should be instead of black.

Now the cropping really is not bad at all, a lot of the comparison videos I have seen of the 4:3 compared to the 16:9 is a joke it is not that bad at all, yes there is a fair amount cropped out, but what is cropped out is not important details at all, and what is added to the sides always felt like the details are a little more important.

With that being said I highly recommend this product, especially for those who are just getting into the dragon ball series, the video quality is incredible, and the colors are very true. For the most part nothing is over or under saturated. And piccollo DOES NOT look like a green highlighter.

It would have be nicer if it was restored with just adding footage to the sides instead of taking some off the top and bottom  and adding a little to the sides, but all in all it still looks great.",1392595200,8,996,4.123711340206185

5972214,4,B00F9IB1M4,"Let me preface this. I'm in my thirties. I've got DBZ releases across Pioneer discs, Funimation single discs, Dragon Boxes, Orange Bricks, Funi Blu Rays and steelbooks of the movies, and now these new Blu Rays. I never got the Level sets, because the Dragon Boxes had just finished, it seemed kind of pointless at the time, but now I realize it's a shame that they cancelled full frame Blu Ray releases. But my point here, I'm going to try to make an argument FOR these Blu Rays, and I'm not new to this franchise, and I'm not an ""accept everything and like it"" fan. I may have bought some Orange Bricks, but I was not a fan of the cropping on those releases.

I received my Blu Ray of the first season, and after watching it, I popped in the first Dragon Box, and then individual discs of the Captain Ginyu saga to compare the openings, and the colors. The Dragon Boxes essentially look like VHS releases next to this. They're certainly nice to own, but I'm willing to do my next rewatch of the entire series in the new Blu Ray format. Also, the cropping isn't NEARLY as egregious on these season sets. It is handled much, much better than the Orange Bricks. Obviously, you are still losing image, but the episodes now pan and scan up and down, left and right, and fill in areas being lost. The Orange Bricks were simply a crop, dead center.

Yes, it's incredibly frustrating that the Dragon Boxes instantly went out of print. It's also almost a certainty that the uncut, full frame episodes will receive another release in the future, since we know Funimation will release the Dragon Ball franchise forever, and that's understandable, as it's the most bankable anime series of all time, arguably. There's also the bone that was thrown compiling all the Pioneer DVDs in the ""Rock The Dragon"" box set, which for many people fills their need to watch the (albeit edited versions of) episodes found on the first two Dragon Boxes, leading up to the Captain Ginyu releases on DVD, where many of us started buying the uncut DVD's many years ago, before the Orange Brick releases existed.
However, as far as the new Blu Rays go, if you despise the way they look, you probably already bought the Dragon Boxes. It's not as though there was a shortage of uncut, full frame Dragon Ball Z releases in the past, it's just that it was the process of compiling endless four episode single disc releases. There was also the unfortunate gap of the 30 or so late Saiyan Saga/early Namek Saga releases that can still only be filled by the Dragon Boxes if you want an original full frame presentation, uncut, with both languages. (There's also the matter of not having consistent, full frame releases of every episode with Faulconer's music score, for those that want it. ) But if you're the kind of fan who hates what is being done with the new remastering/matting/cropping, you bought those. If you didn't, then you'll probably just have to wait another two years until the next re-release, or buy DBZ Kai DVD's/Blu Rays.

Now, onto the remastering. It's become the accepted thing to do, if you're a hardcore fan, to say that they look awful. For me, the issue should just be aspect ratio, but not the remastering. I would have MUCH rather had these Blu Rays in 1:33.1, 4:3. But the new, bright colors? These are not the issue.
Show the comparison screenshots of Saibamen going around to 20 people who are not members of a DBZ message board, and ask what looks better, and  19 out of 20 will pick the remastered shot. It's incredibly insulting to say that these people are ""low information idiots"" or ""they don't know anything about film"". People are advocating grainy footage with a gray haze over it, or arguing that excessive grain maintains the integrity of the original material. Yes, the new hipster-y thing to do is claim that film grain is detail. Film grain is inherent in the ""canvas"", so to speak, when something is filmed. Film is the canvas for the animated image. But grain is not painted onto the original film CEL. If you've seen a film cel from an anime such as this, it's bright, and it's clean. As remastering pushes things more to what a clean, painted film cel looks like, people have now begun to cry ""Where's the grain?"" Think back to when DVD came out. If you had shown the old Saibamen shot as a VHS picture example, and the DVD release looked like the remaster, everyone would say ""Look how clear it is! Look how DVD makes the colors pop!"" Why the shift to wanting everything to look like a twenty year old VHS?

If you were worried about DBZ looking the way it did on 1989 on someone's TV in Japan, then you should be watching it on a tiny, standard definition TV. On VHS. In raw Japanese with no subtitles, since those weren't there for the original broadcast. And you wouldn't be watching an English dub, since that wasn't there for the original broadcast. Again, I get arguing for aspect ratio, but making something look bright and clean and giving the image new life is not a bad thing. The original masters exist. The VHS exists. The old DVDs exist. No one has thrown them all into a fire. This is like when a painting is restored. Look up the process of restoring old paintings, it's done to make them bright, clear, and make the image pop again.

The point of the new Blu Rays is to make DBZ look like a brand new show, even though it isn't. And again, since we've seen it in its original form, more or less, then it doesn't hurt to look at it the way it's never been seen before. (It also helps to consider this as making all of the episodes look like the 14 movies that were shown in widescreen, 13 of which were animated in 1.33:1, but intended to be shown widescreen.) If DBZ aired on TV next year on Cartoon Network, it'd probably look like these Blu Rays, and a whole spate of new fans would find out about it, etc. This is also curiously like what was done with Seinfeld, which has aired in a widescreen HD version for the past 5 or 6 years on HD TV channels. (I think Seinfeld was actually filmed on 32mm film stock and cropped to 1.33:1 for TV, actually, though.) I have never heard anyone complain about watching HD Seinfeld, though.

On a side note, a large % of the reviews here are from people who do not own this set, have not seen how this set looks besides a YouTube trailer, and many of them haven't purchased any DBZ. You'd be surprised how often you encounter message board posts where people keep ""holding out for something better"" every time DBZ is re-released, and admit that they own nothing of the previous releases. I really don't think Funimation is interested in the fans who don't spend money, and complain endlessly about every release.",1391558400,201,6682,4.503709810387469

5972223,4,B00F9IB1M4,"This review is mainly on the Blu-ray itself. (which I own a copy of, AND actually had seen a few episodes)  All I can say about this show is that it may not be my favorite show, but I did grew up with this title when I was a kid (not this much) and it has its moments.  At times, the fillers that were not in the original Manga can make the show drag... a lot.  I recommend people to read the manga for the best experience, but the anime is still a good show to watch.

In regards to the releases: Funimation never ceases on milking this title since the 90's, from VHS, DVD's to now Blu-ray.  Before discussing this set, I would like to discuss my earlier experiences with the earlier sets starting with the Season Set DVDs made years ago. (the next paragraph would start the analysis of this new release for those that only want to know about this.)
- The ""Orange Brick"" DVDs were the first to have the entire series in 9 affordable box sets with controversial video framing and restoration, the worst being the widescreen cropping.  From my memory, it wasn't that great of cropping, and its details and colors were troubling.  It included 3 audio versions (the Original language and the newly-revised Funimation Dub [both in 5.1 mix with original Japanese music and 2.0 with American Broadcast music heard mainly on Toonami at the time]).  The Marathon Mode was a nice feature (no need to revisit the opening, the ending, and ""previously on"" segments all the time).
- Then came the ""Dragon Boxes"" which corrected what should have been: A faithful (though still questionable, in regards to the colors) restoration from Toei Animation and Pony Canyon in 2003, the 2.0 American Soundtrack mix dropped for better video quality, leaving the original language and 5.1 mix, and presented in 7 well-made boxes nearly replicating the original imported Dragon Boxes.  Needless to say, the video quality was superior than the previous boxes.  It felt better seeing this than the previous sets.  It also had ""Next-Time previews"" that were never aired nor presented before on American DVDs. Unfortunately, these were not dubbed for these previews.  Like the imported box sets, these sets were definitely limited edition.  These can now be hard to get if one wants all 7 boxes.
- In 2011, Funimation at one point decided to be generous to the fans, and provided Blu-ray sets called the ""Level Sets"".  These used newly-transfered restorations from Funi that retained the film grain, kept the original aspect ratio, got rid of most of the dirt and damage, and provided quite possibly the best version of DBZ out there.  I couldn't believe the quality that this set provided.  Only problem?  Funimation had to cancel the sets all together after releasing 2 sets due to what they state ""high costs of restorations"".  Will Funi go back to do this and continue from there? ... oh, if only.

2 years after the release/cancellation of the Level Sets, Funimation is releasing the show again on Blu-ray, this time in affordable packaging featuring the same amount of episodes from the orange Boxes, now referred to as the Blue Boxes (Seems that Funi would be able to provide the entire series this time around with pre-orders of future sets made.)  What will people now get with this, and future, set(s)?
1) Another cropped widescreen release. ... but not as bad as it seems.  As stated in the press releases, Frame-by-frame pan-and-scanning was used to not crop out the important information.  It's now better than the orange sets, and at times, you wouldn't mind seeing this in widescreen rather than the 1.33:1 ratio.  And I almost thought that Funi would use the troublesome HD source used for the Orange Sets.  It's that tolerable. ... except for the End Credits.  Severely cropped further.  No joke, it's actually that bad.  The opening is cropped nice but not the ending? ... why bother?
2) HEAVY (distracting) DNR.  This is mainly the one negative thing about this set.  At times, you might not notice the issue. Other times though, it's beyond intolerable.  I've seen better handling on DNR through other titles.  Depending on the scene, it can get very distracting.  Why bother removing the grain entirely if it makes the picture quality worse? (same question to the Orange sets, but this is a Blu-ray release!  Meaning more flaws detected!  The Orange DVD sets had DNR also, but somehow, it looks more washed-up.  Guess they shouldn't have give artificial sharpening on this.) I now question Funimation's quality control in regards to the balance of grain.  Again, it's not always the case throughout the episodes, but depending on the screen size and technology on your HDTV, it can look bad at times.
3) Color and Detail.  The colors can look nice (not the colors of the Dragon Boxes, but at least it mostly looks natural), and detail is a step-up from the Orange sets (despite the harsh DNR applied).  Most of the dirt and dust has been removed, another sign that it's not the same HD master that was used in the Orange Boxes.  Not that much to say in this area.
4) Like the level sets, this contains the 3 audio tracks from the DVDs in Lossless Dolby TrueHD. (even the original language which is mainly in mono!)  The Audio quality is, as expected, the best I've ever heard.  The original language is sadly (and strangely) muffled, but I guess not much could be done on the original language version.  Not a lot of complaining here.  Subtitles included for translation of original language.  The differences between the original translated subtitles and the Funimation dubs can be staggering.
5) Marathon Mode is back (like in the Level Sets).  Nice.

In the end, it's not the release we wanted (in fact, it's the complete opposite of the Level Set/Dragon Boxes), but it's good enough for those that aren't that picky on the video quality.  I'm not a hard-core fan of this, as some are in the fandom, so I wouldn't complain much for this release.  The pricing is very justifiable, so I guess, for what it is, it's a decent release.  A huge upgrade to the Orange Boxes thankfully, but a step-back from previous (and better) releases.  Here's hoping that Funi can at least improve the quality for these future sets.
If it sells well, fans might get a more faithful release like how the Dragon Boxes went though thanks to the sales of the orange boxes... along with Dragon Ball and GT Blu-ray sets.",1391040000,29,6388,4.736651583710407
5972224,1,B00F9IB1M4,I didn't mind the orange bricks but I by no means want an up-scaled version of them as the definitive bluray release for Dragon Ball Z. Why could you give DBZ the same treatment you gave the yuyu hakusho blurays? or even the level blurays that you started to release and for some reason stopped?,1391040000,8,295,4.381818181818182
5972225,5,B00F9IB1M4,"For the first time I can honestly say Funimation did a fantastic job remastering the original Saiyan Saga. The picture is vibrant and crisp; it looks like it came out in 2009, not 1989. The cropping is not an issue because nothing important is taken away; you can still see the what's going on in every scene, and only occasionally a character's forehead might be chopped off, but you can still see his eyes of course.

Bottom line, the picture looks absolutely phenomenal on my 42"" HDTV and I'm thankful that Funimation is giving Dragon Ball Z a proper blu-ray treatment. Now they just need to follow through and release the rest of the series, so please support them by starting out with the Saiyan Saga!",1390953600,2,706,4.603174603174603

5972227,4,B00F9IB1M4,"First things first, audio video, both fantastic.  Yes, they cut a bit on the tops and bottoms to make it fit widescreen but it looks INCREDIBLE, SO much better than it ever did in other formats!  Looks and sounds amazing.  Tops.

Why am I torn?  I liked the pacing of Kai, and didn't mind the standard 4:3 ratio.  HOWEVER, in Kai they took the initiative to re-draw several sequences, but they looked so jarring and out of place compared to the rest of the footage that it just took you out of the experience.  I couldn't get into Kai.  Right when I would be getting into it, there'd be an obnoxiously CLEAN, SHARP scene and you just snap out of it like, ""ugh.""

And honestly, it's much more immersive without the black bars on the sides.  I'm sorry; as much as I don't care for the filler in the original series, I'm gonna have to give this set the nod.  If you have the older orange-box DVD releases and didn't mind the aspect ratio, and want to step your collection up to the HD age, you should definitely pick this up.  It has all the audio tracks included; Japanese, English dub/Japanese Music and English dub/FUNimation music.  Very complete.

If you're a purist who NEEDS those lost inches of footage in the 4:3 ratio, stay away.  Otherwise, you're in for a treat.  I forgot I pre-ordered this; after putting it in, I have to say, I'm not upset.",1390780800,2,1352,4.412955465587045

Pos picture is nice but cropped although i do agree not as severe as the orange bricks which are horrible
The ending severely cropped although its not that important but still pricing great.

Neg show still cropped especially the ending and ofcoarse as a fanboy myself i want to see the show on its finest perfection.

The level 1.1 bluray release was better but funimation cancelled due to expenses its all about the money ofcoarse
For a non collector or a die hard fan of the series this is okey for a fanboy like myself nevermind i have the all dragon box so who cares about this release unless they release the dragonbox on bluray i won't shed money on this so called bluray releases by the way still waiting for the dragon box movies wonder when they will release that one.

Cropping is barely noticeable as it was in orange bricks. Personally i like it in 16:9 it seems like the action is closer and in HD its gorgeous because they did an amazing job you don't miss out on anything. There aren't any chopped heads or anything devastating like that, they are doing a whole new remaster for this set.

Also note that ALL DBZ seasons 1-9 will be released through this Blu-ray set; it is even noted on the side of the case with the 9 squares. They highlight the season you're looking at and also highlight past seasons. (Ex. Season 3 will have 3 squares filled to show it's 3 of 9.)",1390348800,11,599,4.704761904761905

I did not own the orange box DVD's, but I did borrow them from a friend and watched every episode upon their release. Sadly, I was not happy with the quality or the fact that I had to turn my volume up extremely high to hear the voice acting.

Visuals:
This set fixes all of the flaws in my opinion. Given the anime is old and was originally broadcast in 4:3 ratio, I have no problems with the editing Funimation made to convert the anime to a 16:9 ratio. Honestly, you cannot even tell a difference.

The colors are much more vibrant and definitive compared to previous releases and are sharper due to the upscale.

Audio:
There are 3 different audio options, just like the Orange Boxes. However what sets them apart is the quality of the English Dub. ITs so much more clear with this release. The English Dub was how I originally stumbled upon the show. I am partial to it because of nostalgia. I totally suggest this BluRay to viewers who love voices like Gohan's on the original Toonami debut.

I am giving this set a 5 out of 5 because its a solid upgrade from the Orange Boxes and the overall presentation is incredible (box art, packaging, etc.)",1390262400,8,1373,4.476

5972238,5,B00F9IB1M4,"...except its not Ocean Dub, its Funimation U.S. dub "" )

Many reviewers on this site and others will say that it is NOT the same as watching it when they were little because it has been altered to be a 16x9 aspect ratio versus the original 4:3 ratio. While it was indeed created for 4:3 viewing, and the purists out there will always want it in that way (I enjoy both 4:3 and 16:9), and you can definitely tell a difference in what is ""cropped off"" and what is not in some DBZ releases, such as Kai versus the orange box DVD sets, this new blu-ray release of the orange box sets is actually much better.

They took time to make sure that less of the image is cropped off than before ( on the orange box sets) while still clearing up the picture to make it look like most HD quality videos today. Now don't get me wrong - I really enjoyed the DBZ Level Sets,which were in 4:3 aspect ratio, grainy, old looking - it was like reliving my childhood. However, I understand the reasons for Funimation doing what they did.

There are those who are saying ""this is crap... stop bsing us Funimation... we want DBZ in blu-ray at 4:3 quality, just how it used to be!!! >:((("". Well, they did that with the level sets (1.1, 1.2) and due to it being really expensive to take the original film prints and code them over to blu-ray and the dissapointing sales on the level sets, they had to cancel it. Then they even went as far as to make a poll, asking users if they prefer the original 4:3 aspect and quality, or if they would like them to make it in 16:9 and today's quality HD. Although tons of users complain about the 16:9, the voters actually picked 16:9! It's cheaper for Funimation to make since its today's standard and can sell it cheaper so fans can buy more episodes per $.

Trust me, I have bought all the DBZ available (orange brick, rock the dragon, kai, all movies in dvd and blu ray, dragon boxes, level sets, etc.) And although I prefer the old-style cartoon grainy look with the 4:3 aspect ratio, it is immeasurably easier and still thoroughly enjoyable for Funimation to produce these sets and for us to buy them.

My two cents: Please stop bashing Funimation for doing what their fans actually voted for, and support their releases by buying them so they will continue to release the full-length DBZ episodes in blu-ray, and not just the edited version of Kai. I love Kai, but I want both the filler episodes and Kai!",1390089600,4,2426,4.3584070796460175

While I think ideally I would have preferred the original aspect ratio the cropping has been done tastefully and has not been distracting or prevented me from being fully immersed in the show. The artifact and noise reduction (while perhaps a little overzealous at times when it comes to noise) has resulted in a generally consistent, extremely clean, vibrant video that is an absolute joy to watch. The bright, vibrant colors are greatly appreciated. At times, it's almost hard to believe that the animation is at old as it is.

5972244,5,B00F9IB1M4,"I may not be, as many would call it, a ""true"" DBZ fan, considering my rather late interest in the series. I just started watching this a few years ago when I bought the orange brick sets on DVD. I know, I know. . . They apparently suck and aren't the real deal, but that's what I first experienced the show on. That said, I can only really offer my opinion on this release in comparison to those versions I HAVE seen. So, here goes. . .

Video Quality: The moment I received my purchase, I set out to compare the quality to that of the DVD sets I had in my possession at the time. The Blu-ray, I set to my 720p screen, while I had the DVD playing on my 1080. Even with the reduced resolution, the difference was obvious. Colors and line-work were much, much clearer, no sign of blotches or dust marks, and even much of the odd frame shaking had been reduced. It was still there, that's sure, but there was significantly less of it. Lastly, the cropping, which is what everyone is complaining about, was done better in this release than in its orange brick counterpart. They did a better job focusing on the characters and important parts of the video rather than haphazardly cutting off the edges as before.

Sound Quality: While watching the DVDs, I noted a lot of fluctuation in the volume. Some segments were quieter, while others were louder (this is much more noticeable while wearing headphones). The blu-ray set, however, did not have this issue. The sound quality is much clearer and less static-ridden (particularly in the mid-episode transitions).

Overall Presentation: The box itself is much more conveniently small and compact than the DVDs and the discs are organized in the fashion standard to blu-ray, which, in my opinion, is easier to manage than the awkward overlapping arrangement found in the Orange brick sets. Additionally, there are (as one would expect) more episodes per disc, thereby reducing the number of physical discs in the set, so you don't have to switch out your discs quite as often.

So there you have it. A review from a standpoint not colored by nostalgic attachment or a generally biased dislike for FUNimation's involvement in this series. I hope this helps your decision on whether or not to buy this set.",1389744000,81,2247,4.63819095477387

5972246,5,B00F9IB1M4,"Every DBZ set had its Flaws, but I learned to Deal with it the Best way I knew how.

VHS- Added features that was taking out on DVD, like when Freiza was mad for not having Namekians having a password, he Called the Namekian's Green Gobbily Goos, and was Cusing and Ranting in front of Captain Ginyu. Also When SSJ Gohan powered up before fighting Cell in Faith in a Boy Episode. Trunks, Piccolo, Android 16 & Vegeta all commented on SSJ Gohan's power, but on DVD it was removed.

Dragonball Box, oh yes the Beloved 4:3 Ratio's Lovers, was excellent, but it was missing my Bruce Faulconer music, that I grew up enjoying. I honestly hope Funimation makes this into Blu-Ray, to stop all the senseless Crying.

Orange Brick Perfect for having all 3 Audios and music to Listen from. I'm glad Funimation decided to make this into Blu-Ray to please most of the Masses.

Basically, learn to Adapt to changes, and try to see the Good that came from this. I'm still not happy about Yu Yu Hakusho Blu-Ray being widescreen only, it should have an option for full screen, but I'm learning to Adapt.

As for the 16:9 issue, I really, ahem, COULDN'T care less if it was in 4:3 or not. The cropping is NOT bad at all. Seriously? You will rate this 1 star and not buy the HD product at all because your missing the very top part of a characters hair and things like that? You REALLY need to see that?

5972250,5,B00F9IB1M4,"Yes, the vocal minority has trolled the reviews before the product came out and gave it really low scores because of the frame cropping to accomplish the 16:9 modern TV aspect ratio. l don't quite understand what the fuss is about, especially when you actually sit down and watch it in isolation. Sure, if you put the 4:3 original frame next to the same frame in 16:9 you feel like you are losing a lot of data on the top and bottom. It's kind of like when you notice you can see your nose throughout the day, you suddenly you can't stop noticing it.

I just want to say though, that this release does a very good job with the cropping and doesn't just sleazily zoom into the image for a cheap widescreen effect. With this release you of course lose some real estate on the top and bottom, but you gain some on the left and right which wasn't originally there. This greatly helps reduce the feeling that the image was ""scrunched"", like the Orange Bricks were criticized for. It looks quite natural now and the characters faces are always kept in view and I never once felt that my experience was tainted because of the 16:9. Think about it, since the extra sides are added in, it's no longer necessary to zoom in as far to accomplish the 16:9 ratio.

Also, ironically a lot of the self proclaimed ""hardcore/faithful"" Dragon Ball Z fans heartily recommend watching the Dragon Ball DVD box sets first. Why is this ironic? They are apparently in 4:3, but some film grain was removed, the colors brightened, and the image zoomed in on. Yes, it is true that the Dragon Ball box sets are the only ones available, but the point still stands. If you go over to the reviews for Dragon Ball there are hardly any rampaging tantrums about ""This is garbage! You are losing the top and bottom of the images! Don't buy this Funimation abomination!!!"" The Dragon Ball sets don't even grant you the extra real estate on the sides of the screen like this Blu Ray set does. I thoroughly enjoyed the Dragon Ball sets, and as a result I'm loving this DBZ set.

Some complain that the colors are too vibrant or contrasted. Occasionally you might notice the case of some extra dark lines or vibrant colors when you would have thought of them being softer, but we have TV adjustable color settings for a reason. Not every TV will display colors the same way. My Panasonic Viera 50"" plasma displays them wonderfully and it never seems too harsh. The colors look beautiful, crisp, clean, and more natural.

I just want to confidently recommend these sets like many recommend the Dragon Ball box sets. These are far better in my estimation and I want to encourage those who have been discouraged or on the fence due to the flaming and negative criticism that is has received.

I'm open for feedback--lets keep this constructive.

That being said, when I saw this release coming I had some mixed emotions regarding the cropping from the 4:3 ratio, which has obviously been a pretty heated debate amongst fans since the announcement of this set (and also why I held off writing a review until I actually watched it for myself).  Now that I've seen it, this is by far the best looking/sounding DBZ I've seen, and I've seen a lot of DBZ (I'm going back to the original VHS stuff now).  In my opinion they did a much a better job with the cropping this time.  For the people that won't buy this due to the cropping, or the fact that they want to wait for the Dragonboxes on Blu-Ray, the only reason we got the Dragon Boxes in the first place was because of the fans that showed up and purchased the Orange-Bricks initially.

5972264,5,B00F9IB1M4,"ok i have to say that i really hate the cropping because it deletes original fresh image, but this set was made wonderfully. The HD is so amazing that it looked like a brand new anime, it does not feel like an 80's anime anymore. the cropping is better that the one done on the orange bricks. i am a big fan of this series so i had to buy it right of the bat. i know i lot of those haters talking trash about this set just because of the cropping, i was one of those haters by the way. just the fact that they cropped one of the best series in the world if not the best really pissed me off, and it still does but i rather get Dragon Ball Z in blu ray than to not get it at all.
now i am just waiting for Ranma 1/2 to be released for pre order, its finally coming out on blu ray! another big news for anime blu ray-DVD collectors! Ranma is out for pre order on rightstuff.com but i am waiting for amazon to release it.

They remastered it and it looks and sounds great, the colors are so bright and crisp. I recommend this to any dbz fan that's been want the see it in high definition. As for all those people that rated it a one star just because it's in wide screen format not the 4:3 maybe it's time to upgrade your old tube tv so that it won't bother you as much.",1389052800,2,529,4.0476190476190474

5972270,4,B00F9IB1M4,"I first watched DBZ back when I was four and it was dubbed by the Ocean group. I still continued to watch it throughout the years in wait for the new dubs from Funimation and into the rest of the series years later. I had some of the tapes that were released, but waited years to get the any of the large pack releases. I made the mistake of passing up the Dragon Boxes when I saw them at Best Buy years ago because I didn't know they were limited. I was interested in the level sets, but was glad I didn't find out about them until after they had been canceled, so I didn't waste money there.

Honestly, I think this is a solid release. I do like widescreen, but would prefer 4:3 so that I could watch all of it. The picture and sound quality are very nice, and the marathon play is an awesome feature. The picture is very cleaned up without removing important details, though if you pay close attention, the background shakes slightly sometimes.

If I had the choice, I'd buy a release that is the entire uncut series untouched, film grain, funky colors and all. Sadly that doesn't exist, so I'm going to stick with this release and hope it gets all the way through the series unlike the previous level sets. I do think it's silly that they released it strictly cropped when it would be immensely simple for them to have 4:3 and 16:9. If they touched up the 4:3 version people could zoom in on their tv's for 16:9, or else they could have just also put a zoomed in version on disc for those who are confused by technology.

If you want to cry about it being cropped, then hand write a letter to Funimation about it to show them how dedicated you are. Spamming Amazon's review section will just annoy Amazon and anyone who comes to look for honest reviews from people who actually own the product. Amazon isn't to blame for this cropped relased, Funimation is, so go whine to them. If they do eventually make a 4:3 release of the entire uncut series I will be happy to buy it as well.",1388880000,4,1985,4.288

If you're concerned with the 4:3 to 16:9, i'm with you. I did notice that there is more picture added to the sides though that is not in the 4:3. But that also means the top and bottom was cropped as well. If I figure it out, i'll post some screen shots of the 4:3 vs 16:9 BluRays the scene is Piccolo and Raditz.

So i like many other users was bothered by the 4:3 removal and instead a cropped version of it (16:9) but let me tell you i just received this today watch a good 5 episodes and i am stung on good of a job they did the clarity is insane the content that is cut off isn't honestly that bad. the majority of their cuts didn't really impact the content at all it is really rare to see someones head cut in half. from my memory this prob only happened once within the first 5 episodes i saw. Trust me buy this and you definitely will not be disappointed. It is DBZ at its Greatest.,1388880000,5,654,4.038461538461538
5972273,5,B00F9IB1M4,"FIRST THINGS FIRST:
Most of the reviews for this item are from angry fans who didn't get the aspect ratio they wanted and rated this item poorly because it is represented in 16:9 (for todays televisions) and not 4:3 (original broadcast). THIS IS NOT A 4:3 RELEASE SO STOP RATING IT AS SUCH.

Now that that's out of the way. Some quick facts...

3 WAYS TO WATCH:
 - English voice with Japanese audio (Orange Box dub)
 - original US broadcast release
 - all Japanese

UNCUT:
 - no ""white flashes"" when punches make contact
 - blood has not been removed
 - With previous releases (most notably DBZ Kai) a lot of the filler episodes (sometimes whole seasons) were cut out. They are all  present here. (To me, they are great stories that show character growth)

PRO's:
 - THE GRAIN FROM PREVIOUS RELEASES IS GONE!!
 - the best picture quality for DBZ (beats DBZ Kai in my opinion)
 - colors are vibrant and beautiful
 - 1.78:1 (aka 16:9) for widescreen televisions

CON's:
 -  the slip cover is a little loose

I HEAVILY researched this item before buying it because there were too many questions unanswered. I hope I have been able to answer all of those questions here. I am happy with my purchase and will be buying all the remaining seasons as they are released. I hope this review has helped answer some of your questions.",1388880000,10,1322,4.548936170212766
5972274,5,B00F9IB1M4,come on people i know it suck that it been cropped but trust me as a owner of all dbz set that have ever been release this if by far the best one when it come to picture quality and everything eles the only bad thing is the it cropped but they did a good job on cropping it because it look if were only loosing 10 percent of the footage not 20 like the orange bricks never the less this set is the best set and i cant wait to see season 3 in blu ray with this quality and the rest of the season. this quality is the best quality on dbz,1388880000,6,535,3.7017543859649122
5972275,5,B00F9IB1M4,"I just received my copy today and I was slightly worried about all of the prerelease buzz complaining about the cropping. I watched the first handful of episodes and I have to say that this show has not looked better!

16:9 IS NOT YOUR ENEMY! DBZ looks better than ever!",1388880000,2,270,4.4
5972276,4,B00F9IB1M4,"I think people should stop complaining about these sets already. Funimation already tried to release what the fans supposedly wanted but guess what..... They had to stop production on them because not enough people bought them. Yes those level 1.1 and level 1.2 sets sold like crap. Now Funimation will release what they know will sell and that is what the casual crowd wants and that is exactly what this set delivers. For better or worse this is what we got and for what it is worth, it is a competent set. It might not be perfect but it gets the job done. It is what it is and we got to live with it. I recommend this purchase for all but the HARDCORE anime fans because this set wasn't released for them but for the casual fan. In that respect it delivers on its promise.",1388880000,5,775,4.315068493150685
5972277,5,B00F9IB1M4,"I have been a DBZ fan since 1998. Before broadband was available in my area, I would negotiate trades over iRC chat for episodes and movies from across the pacific over my sweet V.91 US Robotics 56k modem. Since I lack a banana for scale, the Future Trunks movie weighed in at at whopping 36 MB. These credentials should be enough to silence the haters who are not appreciating the hard work the funimation staff put in to not only the updated visual quality of this release, but the Dolby digital soundtrack that was remastered for this release. My favorite feature from this release is the ""marathon"" menu option which skips the intro song and keeps the sweet content flowing. If you are a fan of this anime, you can not go wrong with this four disc blu-ray release. The production team has out done themselves in bringing this series into the HD era. I just hope that I can pickup the remaining seasons for the price I scored this season for. Flame on haters....",1388793600,12,965,4.52
5972278,1,B00F9IB1M4,"I got this item as a surprise gift from my wife, she knows I love dragonball as a whole, what she did not know was that I was not interested in this.  My wife did not know about the picture cropping.
I have the level sets which I think were as close to the Dragon Boxes as we'd ever get.  I was hoping for more Level Sets maybe with more than 17 episodes on them but I'd gladly pay that price for those sets anyways.. She knew I was waiting for more blu rays LIKE the level sets not this junk.
I appreciate the thought from my wife, I do.  I acted like I was excited and I knew about this release.  I eventually filled her in on everything and showed her the difference of the original ""Full Screen"" compared to this ""Cropped"" nonsense... She could even tell the difference in picture and she felt bad about the purchase. I told her I would keep it and she said if you don't like it, trade it in at moviestop... Needless to say.. I did.

Anyways... FUNimation, why they did this I don't know. I watched a few episodes but it bothers me to watch it because I know I'm missing picture.. Call me anal, call me whatever.. But that the way I am. It bothers me.  Some people won't realize about it, some people won't care..
But it's an unnecessary change.  While I'm OK with color correcting and remastering and what not, I am not OK with cutting out picture.
I do not recommend anyone purchasing this.  I recommend people showing FUNImation that this is wrong and we demand more Level sets.  The level sets were the proper release for the blu rays... Again not as good as the dragonbox... But damn near close.. This set however cuts about 20% - 30% picture.
Don't give these guys the sales they want.  They need to release the dragon boxes on blu ray or more level sets not this crap.
This is my opinion so don't take it to heart or take offense to it. If you like it good, I feel that you wasted your money though.",1388793600,11,1910,4.193989071038251

The show looks amazing and it has all 39 episodes from season one housed on 4 discs. It is in HD glory all the way. I remember watching my DVDs of this show on the flat screen and it was soooo painful because the clarity just wasn't there. Now with this release, the show is bright, crisp, and sharp.

5972282,4,B00F9IB1M4,"I bought this a while ago and I even posted a Youtube review of it. 90% of the people reviewing this don't even own the damn thing. They're complaining about the aspect ratio. UM....Why does it matter if you can't see that extra patch of grass on the ground? It isn't like the orange bricks where you can't see half the character's face.

That being said, I'm 22 now and I grow up with this more than a decade ago. FIRST OFF what we saw as young kids back then was the Ocean Dub, this is FUNimation's dub. It's not THAT GREAT because it doesn't have the original Vegeta saying: It's Over 9,000"" and when it comes to Season 1? I personally think FUNimation doesn't do that good of a job that Ocean did. The Picture quality is amazing and eveything else is here. The music is amazing, I prefer the american music version of DBZ than the japanese which at the time had very few tracks to it. In the american release every character has their own theme which is great.

I personally dislike the FUNimation, I'm sure Season 2 of DBZ Blu Ray is better because I grew up with FUNimation during their take of season 2 - 9 but personally I feel, for nostalgia reasons, that this should've stayed with the Ocean group. Picture quality is great, I love that grain feel of it, makes it authentic and stylish & the music is very pleasant and fits the characters and situations a lot better.

Buy it if your a big fan of Season 1 and don't care if the voices aren't the same as when you heard it as a kid but these people complain WAY TOO MUCH",1388620800,9,1529,4.247422680412371

5972284,3,B00F9IB1M4,"I don't actually own this release, however I was able to borrow a friend's copy just so I would be able to give a (almost un-biased) review. For this review, I watched and compared episodes 1-34

Pros:
- In terms of picture quality, it is slightly less grainy than the Level 1.1 and 1.2 Blu-ray sets; but it's barely noticeable unless you looked very hard. In comparison with the Dragon Box....well let me put it this way: in order for the Dragon Box to be as high quality as possible, Toei subtlety brightened the episodes to tweak the color palette; in some instances this helps (like bringing out Goku's dark orange and dark blue Gi to a bright orange and a slightly light blue Gi) and in other instances it hurts (like when the bright lime green grass is changed to a pale light green grass). With this release (and the previously mentioned Level 1.1 and 1.2 release), FUNimation balances things out by slightly brightening the episodes and using color correction when needed. Overall the animation is beautifully remastered which breathes new life into this 30 year old anime

-Once again, FUNimation gives us the option to watch the episodes in either:
  a) the original Japanese dub with the Japanese music
  b) the US English dub with the Japanese music
  c) the US English dub with the US Nathan Johnson/Bruce Faulconer music

Now for the Cons:
- Unfortunately, these episodes are cropped into 16:9 widescreen. In terms of cropping, between the orange brick season sets and this release there is virtually no difference. The bits of visual information that were lost before are lost once again. The payoff of cropping it into widescreen is, once again, not worth it.

The overall:

Overall, if you're just a casual fan who wants to upgrade your collection from DVD to Blu-ray, then this is not a bad buy.

If you are a die hard fan of the Japanese version with original opening title cards, original title cards, end credit title cards and original next episode previews, then this set isn't for you and I would recommend buying the Dragon Box sets.

If you are a die hard fan of the US/Toonami version with the Nathan Johnson/Bruce Faulconer BGM but were disappointed with the orange brick season DVD boxsets that cropped the original native full screen 4:3 aspect ratio into wide screen 16:9 aspect ratio then, once again, this set isn't for you and I would recommend buying the Level 1.1 and Level 1.2 Blu-ray sets because those sets kept the episodes in the 4:3 full screen.",1388534400,37,2487,4.715935334872979

5972289,3,B00F9IB1M4,"I originally wasn't planning on buying this, but I managed to get a copy for real cheap, and I wanted to see for myself what the footage looked like. I watched and checked several episodes, here are my thoughts:

DISC MENU:
- The menu feels like it's mocking the 4:3 fans. The main menu shows footage that transitions between the widescreen remaster and the Levels 4:3 remaster. It's obvious that the remastered 4:3 Level sets looked better. They only show backgrounds, landscapes, and space scenes so it looks like nothing major is cut off, which is somewhat deceptive.

OPs/EDs:
- The opening intro looks surprisingly good, better than the episodes themselves. I feel the result FUNimation was aiming for is best represented in the intro. Even cropped, nothing detrimental seems to be chopped off. The colors, sharpness, and overall quality of the image seems better. I'm guessing they may have used footage from the movies for the intro, since the movies used better film stock.
- Sadly, the ending theme looks like complete garbage. At first, I couldn't tell what was wrong. But then I realized that even more footage from the ED is missing than just the 20% from everything else. It looks like they chopped off like 40% off the footage. I have no idea why they did this for the ED, but nothing else, because it looks even blurrier and worse than everything else.

REMASTERING PROCESS:
- The colors are extremely bright and saturated, and makes some shots a little hard on the eyes. Overall, I was fine with the brighter colors, but some may call it overkill.
- The color palette is more consistent than the Dragon Boxes IMO, things aren't overly pink/green/yellowed due to age degradation.
- The contrast is too high; especially the darks. Expect plenty of crushed blacks, and dark details (clothes/armor/shadows) to be nearly gone/nonexistent. The brights, such as eyes and skin color, are rather bright, but not to the extent of the Orange Bricks where characters' skin and eye color were indistinguishable.
- The DVNR/filtering they did seems to be a double-edged sword: While the characters themselves are clean and sharp, the process they used has made the outlines so bold that details of the background characters can sometimes be muddled.
- Sadly, the remaster has not done any favors to the backgrounds. They are definitely lacking in detail, and look more like splotchy watercolor than they originally did. The clouds... ye gods, man... the clouds. Also, there's a weird effect on the backgrounds thanks to the remastering. They constantly jitter and wiggle. And I'm not talking about frame jitter (normal for older anime), parts of painting grain and detail will just move around while everything else stays perfectly still, such as logos, titles, and characters. It's distracting to a degree.
- On the plus side, I couldn't find any examples of frame/film damage on this release. No glue, tears, rips, cigarette burns, etc. Also, the issue where outlines would vanish during shaking/fast motion scenes is no longer a problem on this new BR.

CROPPING:
- Maybe I'm just used to the OBs and Kai, but the cropping doesn't seem quite as intrusive as the OBs. I mean, yes the tops and bottoms of frames are gone, but it seems like they either rearranged the framing or zoomed out slightly more to make sure important details weren't completely lost. It's hard to say for sure since I don't have the OBs or the broadcast footage of Kai to compare it to.
- I want to say they even moved the frame manually during certain shots, like when Goku and Piccolo are double-blasted by Raditz. It's really hard to explain without seeing it it motion, but it doesn't look a natural camera pan made by the animators. It were up to me, I'd rather have 4:3 with none of this widescreen BS at all. But I can say it doesn't seem like a total center-cropping job anymore.

EYECATCHES!!!
- The eyecatches aren't cropped. In fact, FUNimation seems to have digitally added white background space to the outsides of the frame that blend in with the rest of the footage to make the whole eyecatch look totally seamless in 16:9.

AUDIO:
- All three audio tracks sound identical to the Levels. The English tracks sound fine and crystal clear. The Japanese track sounds like the audio from the Dragon Boxes, which is fine and serviceable, but no where near the quality of the broadcast audio. Will we see those in future ""Seasons""? Only time will tell.

In summary, I suppose if you haven't for whatever reason picked up DragonBall Z on home video and don't want to spend the inflated prices for the awesome Dragon Box release, these are a decent choice. They look better than the botched ""Orange Brick"" season sets, and have multiple audio options. Dragon Ball Z Kai is also a far better release than this, it's HD remastering looks far more natural, and has higher quality English & Japanese audio. The Dragon Boxes are also an excellent representation of the series, though it's long out of print and hard to find for reasonable prices.

For now, these new Blu-Ray seasons and Dragon Ball Z Kai are your only choices for DBZ in HD.",1388448000,6,5120,4.78393665158371
5972290,3,B00F9IB1M4,"Like the title of this review says, ""A OK Release But, Not the Best"". I have had this product since Friday December 27, 2013. I have watched the entire season and have gone over multiple releases to compare the quality. I have looked at and compared this new release to the Original DVD singles, Ultimate Uncut DVDs, Orange Brick Season One DVDs, Dragon Box Z DVDs, and lastly the DBZ Level Blu-rays. The Original Aspect Ratio of this show is Full Screen (4:3); with this release they have cropped the image into Widescreen (16:9). They have selectively cropped the image into 16:9 so you don't loose any important imagery and the main focal points are still there. Unlike the Orange Brick Releases which were center cropped and would cut out parts of the image that were important.

  I would say that Funimation has done a good job this time around, so well to the point that the cropped image doesn't bother me too much. Although I still would have preferred it to be in Full Screen. They also removed a majority of the grain in the image, not all of it but what is left can be barely seen at all. I do like the way the image came out none the less it is clean, crisp and looks very modern which I am sure that's what this release was going for. But, when it comes to a TV show or Movie that is film based the grain is important. You can remove some but not too much or you will risk removing details of the image, which in this case grain is detail. Don't get me wrong I do like what they have done here, but I don't love it.

  The only real issues I have with this release are the overall colors and contrast/ black levels of the final product. The colors are a tad over saturated, which can be fixed with an adjustment in your TV settings. In my opinion just about everything released today is a little over saturated for my taste so my TV already has the color toned down. The other issue is the contrast/ black levels which can't really be fixed much if at all. The darker colors seem to almost completely blend into the blacks. Anything that has a shadow cast over it has details that are lost due to the darkness of the shadow making everything almost pitch black. Now I can still see these details but only slightly, and only if I sit off to the side of my TV instead of viewing it from the center. I don't know about you but I like to watch TV/ Movies from the center of the screen, not from the sides. It is just like when I go to the movie theater, I always pick a seat that is dead center of the screen and I never like to sit in the side seats.

  Ultimately I do like the release, but I would have rather they continued the DBZ Level Blu-ray sets. The only reason I give it 3 Stars is because it is Dragon Ball Z. In my opinion the Level sets where as good as it gets with DBZ when it came to overall quality. I do hope that this new release will continue and will sell well, and then maybe they will have enough funding to warrant finishing the Level sets. So if you don't mind parts of the image almost being pure black, the image being Widescreen, the grain being removed and the colors being over saturated then buy this product. If you're a collector that loves anything and everything Dragon Ball and have to have every release, then I say buy this and any future releases because you won't be disappointed. But, if any of this bugs you in the slightest then I would hold out for a better release. You could also track the expensive yet worth it Dragon Box Z DVD releases.",1388448000,9,3496,4.229385307346327
5972291,4,B00F9IB1M4,"The majority of reviews for this product are left by individuals who don't even own it. How can one accurately review a product they've never seen in motion, in person? I do own this release, and I can tell you first hand, that this set looks FAR AND AWAY superior to the Orange Bricks, if not (for the most part) any other DBZ release out there.

First, I'll start out with the cons of this set. Most apparently (and inexcusably, IMO) is the aspect ratio. I am not a fan of altering a source's aspect ratio, if it involves losing image. Animated in the 80's, DBZ was crafted in 4:3, and to achieve 16:9, FUNimation cropped image out of the top and bottom of the frame. Sure, there is an extra ~5% new image on the sides, but ~20% is missing vertically.

Now, FUNimation claims to have taken the cropping more delicately with this release, carefully selecting optimal placing to crop each frame, as to keep as much important information in tact. From what I can tell from comparing ~30 screenshots of this to the Orange Bricks, FUNi did the bare minimum. There's a shot in the opening that is reframed. And... That's about it. Everything else is just about as center-cropped as the Orange Bricks.

Fortunately, that is where the main gripes of this release end.

The new remastering looks phenomenal. Fans of modern animation will likely be more accepting of it than that of the grainy ""vintage"" animation. All grain has been removed from the picture. Now let me emphasize that that is NOT bad. With the Orange Bricks, that resulted in inane loss of detail and horribly smudge-like artwork, but not so with this release. FUNimation has managed to remove the grain, while leaving lines completely intact, and details as vivid as ever. Plenty of shots show clearly the very brush-strokes that comprised the painted backgrounds. It is truly a sight to behold.

The only issue I have with the remastered look is the contrast. While, again not as bad as the Orange Bricks, the dark colors can be too dark. For example, nighttime scenes are probably the worst offender here, as when black and other super dark colors are near each other, it becomes difficult to see the separation between the two colors, and detail can be difficult to spot. Luckily, though, this contrast issue is completely fixable by FUNimation for future sets. And as the series itself continues, nighttime scenes are fewer and farther between.

Pro's:
 - Beautifully remastered visuals breathes new life into a 30 year old anime.
  -- Most colors are vibrant and really pop!
  -- Artwork is sharp, clear and detailed, as HD should be!
 - All three audio tracks remain.
  -- FUNi dub with JPN music, FUNi Original Broadcast, Japanese Dub
 - Nearly 40 episodes on 4 discs.
  -- Comfortably fit, no loss of quality due to squeezing too many episodes per disc.
 - Cost effective!

Con's:
 - 16:9 means losing image on top and bottom of each frame.
  -- (Though, there is ~5% extra picture on the sides)
 - High contrast means darkest details are sometimes difficult to make out.

Overall, this is a very good release. If you, like myself, have been pining for an HD release of the greatest anime of all time, look no further than this, FUNimation's Blu-ray Season Set release of Dragon Ball Z!",1388448000,21,3255,4.680140597539543

I was worried that the Blu-rays would have the same problems that the Orange Box sets had, where the cropping was so bad, it cut of heads. However, just starting episode one, I could tell they finally fixed it! In the Orange Box sets, Master Roshi's head is kind of cut off when he is on the rock after the opening is finished, but not on the Blu-rays. His whole head is there and on top of that, there is more picture above his head! The second I noticed they fixed it, is the intermission with Goku and Gohan, which might be the biggest difference. I wish I could share with pictures, but can't.

If you were hesitant on buying this because of the whole cropping issue, don't worry! You will not regret buying this, and not only did they resolve that issue, the picture is just beautiful!

Fools. I know why they did this and it is not just because of the survey in June. It is because Funimation is aware of the fact that television these days are all widescreen and assumed that the younger generation would see the original aspect ratio as sub-par or unusual. Thus, making it less marketable. This is why they discontinued the Level sets. Because they were released at the same time the Dragon Boxes and Kai blurays were.

Despite the truth and authentic origin of the series 4:3 aspect ratio, they chose the younger audience neglecting the hundreds of thousands of Americans who first witnessed this classic series in the United States in 1998 with the series' intended 4:3 ratio. Funimation was on the right path with the Level 1.1 and 1.2 versions. Now Funimation has worsened their situation by modernizing and modifying DBZ, thus ruining the hopes of their original fans of the Japanese version and first true American release in 1998.

Then I read what the aspect ratio was and realized that it had been cropped.  Same thing they did on the orange brick sets that I vowed never to get because of this.  I've been a fan of the series since day one back in 1996.  I was there when the Ocean Dub voices came first and then Funimation stepped in and finished the series off for us after 8 years of waiting to see the conclusion.  I however feel as though Funimation has shafted me once again.  I  know they tried releasing the series once before on Blu Ray in 4:3 aspect ratio and I remember why I never bought it.  Sure the picture was cleaned up and it looked great but it wasn't because of the aspect ratio that I didn't spend my money on it.  IT'S BECAUSE FUNIMATION WAS CHARGING 30-40 DOLLARS FOR ONLY 17 EPISODES WHEN THIS BOX SET COST THE SAME BUT HAS 39, TWICE AS MANY!  THAT'S WHY IT FAILED.  I DON'T BLAME THE PEOPLE IN THE PAST FOR NOT BUYING IT, HECK THEY WERE SMART NOT TOO!  FUNIMATION IS THE REASON WHY IT FAILED AND WHY IT DESERVES TO FAIL AGAIN.  THEY'RE CASHING IN ON THE SERIES AS MUCH AS THEY CAN.

Now they've said they've found an easier way of restoring each episode which means they've found a cheaper way of doing it, it's going to look half-baked, and they'll give us more episodes per set.  They've chosen quantity over quality when I wish it was the other way around.  If they would have made the level sets cheaper or had more episodes then I would have picked up each copy.  It's a shame Funimation isn't loyal like CBS is to their Star Trek Fans every time they release a season of Enterprise or the Original Series.  They know if they want to keep their fanbase happy they'll release it in the right ratio.

5972325,4,B00F9IB1M4,"I will not judge fully from the youtube trailer that has been posted and neither should you, there is obvious filters going on and what you see will obviously look better.  When a video is posted to youtube the video creator will compress the video and with that compression already youtube does it's own compression so you already have 2X compression!  But even so the detail should be apparent and it's frankly not but we'll see when it is released.

Also, Dragon Ball Kai was released in 16x9 during the TV broadcast and on DVD, but the Blu-ray was released in Dragon Balls original aspect ratio.  So it is not like TOEI hasn't released dragon ball in 16x9!

These are not the orange bricks!  The orange season sets were center cropped which was more likely done during the transfer or immediately after the film transfer process.  These are transferred from it's original aspect ration than selectively cropped after the film transfer process.  These are more likely the ""SAME"" film transfer as the Level sets and I say that because if they're going to selectively transfer why not use the best transfer they have?  In all regards these are not the Orange Bricks slapped onto Blu-Ray, HOWEVER!  If missing lines are shown when Nappa is powering up than we can only assume these are indeed the orange bricks but it's very likely these are not.

If you want Dragon Ball Z in it's original aspect ratio I can only recommend the Japanese Dragon Boxes as they're actually cheaper than the US versions, you can get some good deals on Yahoo auctions but you should be able to get DBZ entirely for under $1000 with no problem but these will be region 2, not region 1.  But Dragon Ball Kai will be finishing soon with the Boo ark likely next year and should be released at the end of 2014, If you didn't care for filler Dragon ball Kai would be the best way to go for 4x3 and it looks fantastic!",1384041600,9,1890,4.526470588235294

Blu-Ray is a format designed for giving an experience as close to the Director's intentions as possible.

Cropping this product from the original 4:3 to 16:9 is a travesty and it baffles me how anyone can accept this.

If Disney came out and released cropped versions of Snow White, people would be enraged at the mistreatment of something held in such high regard. Why on earth Funimation thinks its okay to treat Dragon Ball like this is beyond me.

This is just one more thing to add to the collection. People are saying that 16:9 isn't how it was originally suppose to be viewed. Well it also wasn't originally suppose to be dubbed incorrectly or have a completely different music score but that didn't seem to bother anyone. I like to think of the DragonBall series as a sort of Bible, there are countless translations, releases, disputes over releases and each release is different in it's own way. The fact still remains, the money is still going towards the DragonBall franchise and I will gladly continue my support.

In the video Dragon Ball Z: Rebirth Part 1([...] at the 4min mark.  they show the original footage vs the remastered footage granted it does cut off a bit from the top and bottom of the pic, but not enough (at least for me) to get up in arms about this.

More than that, they called it, Dragon Ball Z 1.1"" or something. Most people don't know what that means.

Strange how this release is simple, ""Dragon Ball Z: Season 1 [Blu-ray]""

Why didn't they call the 4:3 Ratio Series that?

I'm not paying for a show that is cropped. People are right, when you buy a movie that is filmed in 4:3 you get 4:3, you don't have Movie Studios cropping the movie so you miss part of the movie.

It would not cost Funimation much to simply release these as 4:3 and then tell people who buy them they can make it widescreen by pressing a button on their TV remote.

Or release both? Why not release the 4:3 AND the widescreen on the same Blu-ray?

Now people will complain saying, "" well, Funimation release the BD in 4:3 but no one bought them?"" This is absolutely false! DBZ BD release in 4:3 sold well, its just the production got canceled right from the start due to, ""technical challenges"" restoring the video frame by frame. It had nothing to due with sales. Also, Funimation did a poll to engaged peoples interest in another shot at releasing DBZ again on BD, but this time they asked for feedback from the fans. Now people, ""Claim"" That 16:9 won this toss because they assume the majority voted for 16:9. Were is the proof in this? Their is none. Just because Funimation does a survey doesn't mean they are going to go with what the fans want when money or problems are in the equation (remember the technically problems they had doing a perfect frame by frame restore on the 4:3 BD).  My guess is they went this route to save money. I feel that its the orange bricks all over again just this time its actually 1080p resolution and probably less saturation. The biggest problem is the 16:9 which is cropped or in laymen terms, a zoomed in picture that appears widescreen. Again, people argue that you are only losing some ground and sky but they forget that most of the show has a lot of up close fights and face shots.

Later it was announced that these new BD's were going to be 16:9, months after FUNimation's survey over aspect ratio (Really they shouldn't have asked, and just given us 4:3, the INTENDED aspect ratio). This later killed off much of my enthusiasm for this new release as like the Orange Brick season sets, these were going to be 16:9, cropping a show made in 1989 to make it more modern and fit people's TV because they hate black bars on the sides of their screen (When most, if not all HDTV's have options in the menu to mess with aspect ratios so the 4:3 image can fit the entire screen). This would mean losing 20% of the image vertically once again, all because enough people can't be bothered to use their remote for their widescreen TV's.

Recently a trailer came out, and it confirmed people's fears that this was going to be like the Orange Brick season sets all over again. Upon closer inspection of the screenshots, this release is actually going to look WORSE than the Orange Bricks. ALL of the grain and detail is practically gone as the footage is highly vectorized and they make the show look much, much worse. This is actually pretty insulting to the fans and the series if you ask me.

So simply once again FUNimation has made Dragon Ball Z, an important anime title look even worse than their mistake from 2007. They go from making the show look better than the Dragon Boxes with the Level sets to making it look worse than those Orange Bricks, to the point it's almost entirely unwatchable.

Once upon a time, TV and movies were in standard 4:3 format. It was nice and square.

Then, let's fast forward to today. The standard resolution is 16:9.
Great, right? More stuff to see on the screen! This is awesome!
Well, sometimes it's not awesome, such as this case.
Basically, the original DBZ was mastered in 4:3. Ya got me?
Anyway, FUNimation rereleased the series in 16:9 format.

That's great, right?
Wrong. Instead of actually 'redoing' the series in true 16:9, to get the 16:9 affect here, they CROP the image. Yes.
You are literally paying for less with this release.

Why would they do this, you ask? To satiate the wants of the masses. When an uninformed consumer sees '16:9' on something that was once '4:3', they have reason to believe that it is a good thing. God forbid those black bars on the left and right show up while I'm watching my show.
Well, in this case it is not a good thing.
Like I said, they are CROPPING the bottom and top of the show, so you are literally not watching the entire series.

5972349,2,B00F9IB1M4,"FUNimation cannot win with ANOTHER DBZ release - UNLESS they give the HARDCORE Dragon Ball Z fans what they want: A Blu-ray version of the Dragon Box releases.

Now forget any online poll or survey - while there may be some casual fans that don't care about aspect ratios or Japanese credits and title cards or next episode previews, those people are not going to purchase every single edition of a multi-volume blu-ray release. The hardcore fans that have purchased every edition, despite their better judgement, will.

Side note: for all the people saying the Dragon Box releases were so wonderful - Even with an edition that was marketed to the hardcore fan, the fan that wanted a release as close to the original product shown in Japan, FUNimation STILL INSISTED on hyping up its own English dub over the Original Japanese Audio. Think I'm kidding? Check out these specs for the audio tracks:
Japanese mono - 48kHz/96Kbps
English 5.1 - 48kHz/384Kbps

96Kbps ?! Gee, can ya spare the room for the audio? No one I know bought the Dragon Boxes for the English dub anyhow, but this is a typical FUNimation move. Their insistence that all their releases after 2008 be ""reversioned"" and not include the actual Japanese intro/end credits and title cards in favor of their credits that hype their dub voice actors, is insulting. I have a feeling that this Dragon Ball Z release will be more of the same - even though there is plenty of disc space to allow for BOTH English and Japanese credits (depending on the audio one chooses to view in) and give BOTH English and Japanese audio tracks equal (or near equal) treatment.

Side note II: FUNimation needs to seriously get some quality control going for their blu-ray authoring team. I have had so many audio synch problems/sub-title problems while attempting to view a great number of their releases. I would be happy to provide them with complete details but FUNimation's customer service stopped responding to my concerns after they offered me two free box sets because of the CHOBITS BD audio problems I reported. Notice, nothing was done to fix the actual problem, just give him some product so he will go away...

BUT NO, they haven't.

As usual, they have screwed the fans over again with cropping the image into a 16:9 image, taking out parts of the frame to make it ""look"" widescreen... this anime was NOT shot in widescreen. It was shot in a standard 4:3 ratio.

Since 2008 i have spent money on the orange brick set, the dragon box, the dragon ball z kai blu-ray volumes and the cancelled Level Blu-ray volumes.
After all this wasted money i have discovered that the only good box sets were the level and kai volumes.

This new boxset however seems like it will be the biggest waste of money yet and it was all based on a survey. Should decisions like that really be based on a survey? If they looked back at peoples reviews on the orange brick sets vs the dragon boxes they would have probably been able to make a better decision which leads me to believe that Funimation themselves are actually in favour of the 16:9 aspect ratio. For the most part I don't even know where this idea of cropping it even came about. I has never been done with any  other anime, not even dragon ball or dragon ball gt but who knows.

5972354,1,B00F9IB1M4,"I'm starting to wonder if we'll ever receive a proper release of DBZ that stays on the market. First they cancel the ultimate uncut sets, then they release the Orange Bricks which are cropped and look terrible. In the same year that the Orange Bricks completed their release, the Dragon Boxes came out. So anyone who bought the bricks without knowing any better got screwed out of the better release if they didn't want to immediately buy DBZ again. The Dragon Boxes also went out of print very quickly, and now you can't get them without paying an arm and a leg. We didn't even hear that the release was limited until sets began disappearing less than one year prior to the first volume's release. That's when Lance from FUNimation confirmed that, indeed, stock was low. By the time the Level sets (which were great) came around, the market was already oversaturated with Dragon Ball releases. The Level sets were coming off the Dragon Boxes, which were coming off the Orange Bricks, then there were movie/TV special rereleases, Dragon Ball and GT bricks, Kai, etc. It's no wonder the release failed. Now we have these cropped DBZ Blu-ray seasons, FUNimation's latest effort to milk the franchise. I'm not mad that these exist, I'm mad that our only options are modernized remasters or out of print sets. Get your s*** together, FUNimation. Where's the release that presents DBZ for what it is, a program animated in full screen over twenty years ago?

At first glance, the sharpness of the visuals might fool you into thinking the release is decent, at least until you realize the art looks like it was done in pastel. Actually, the new remaster's video quality is comparable to the Orange Bricks on DVD (possibly worse, but we'll get to that). It looks like someone digitally set the color scheme to watercolor in their editing software. Exactly like those ""2K HD"" videos on YouTube, they're filtered to hell. It's insulting that people at FUNimation purposely make DBZ look like crap because they think that's what people want. The colors are oversatured and not at all pleasant on the eyes (Piccolo looks like a green highlighter), while the backgrounds are muddied. Any sense of detail is gone in an attempt to remove grain, making the characters look disgustingly plain. What's been accomplished here is a remastering that compromises the original look of the cel, the goal being to give the show a computer animated look (because no one will buy the show if it looks old). The main improvement from Orange Brick to Blu-ray seasons is that there are no longer disappearing lines. The previous remaster was destructive in a way that character outlines/lines on a character's body would be erased. For example, in one scene, part of the line surrounding Nappa's mouth disappeared, almost making it look like he was foaming at the mouth. It doesn't appear to be an issue with this particular release. On the other hand, the bricks still look like they were shot on film, and while the first few bricks looked bad, they did improve towards the end and will likely look better than the Blu-ray season counterparts if the remastering remains consistent throughout. With new remastering also comes new problems, though. Instead of disappearing lines, we have what looks to be streaks of fading grain from the DVNR not being applied properly. The grain is literally fighting to get through the DVNR process, with everything wobbling all around. Really, ""modern HD"" presentation? The animation doesn't look modern; the visuals just got a bad face-lift. The Japanese audio track, which sounds its age, is also really jarring with the modernized footage. It doesn't match at all. Even worse, the marketing people at FUNimation must have realized how much people hate the new remastering, so they put out a commercial with as little footage of the release as possible, instead playing up nostalgia and warm, fuzzy feelings to get fans buying. If Dragon Ball is Toriyama and Toei's baby, then this would qualify as child abuse. Am I the fool here, for being a part of this supposed minority that wants a product similar to the original Japanese broadcast (albeit cleaned up)? If FUNimation can't afford an extensive frame by frame remaster ( la the Level sets) then they should just stop producing new remasters of the series. There's no shortage of DBZ releases. It's GOOD DBZ releases that we're lacking. They're willingly destroying the picture quality for a quick buck. What purpose do these new sets serve? Are they an indirect Kickstarter? We have to pay for the privilege of a better product existing in the future? At the end of the day, I just want to watch the show, and I feel like I can't with these poor quality releases. However, the worst part of this release is that people who don't know any better will pick these sets up, not realizing what's been done to the picture quality. Especially if these people have no frame of reference (Dragon Box or Level footage). FUNimation is taking advantage of their fans' naivet and it sickens me. I pray to Kami that we get a DBZ Dragon Box upscale on Blu-ray to counteract this train wreck.

FINAL VERDICT: Aside from the blinding brightness and the desecrated backgrounds that this remaster has, the visuals are clearer (most of the line work, while blurry, can actually be made out, and the lines don't break and vanish in shaking shots) and the cropping is less obtrusive (it isn't up to the selective cropping of the TV airing for Dragon Ball [Z] Kai; people's heads still get cut off, but it's not as bad as it could be). The Orange Bricks, despite their faults, have better colors and aren't so saturated that they're blinding, and even though they can get quite blurry, more detail can still be made out in the backgrounds (which have been utterly annihilated in the Blu-ray seasons). The Blu-rays also don't have proper grain removal, which leads to shaking and streaks of visible grain appearing in the picture. If I really needed an inexpensive and complete set of Dragon Ball Z and these or the Orange Bricks were my options, the Orange Bricks are certainly less bad. Neither remasters even approach adequacy, though. Then again, none of these releases will break the bank by any means, but that doesn't make them any less offensive to the DBZ purists.",1381449600,38,6314,4.82380073800738
5972355,5,B00F9IB1M4,The Descruption says it will be 1.33:1 which is 4:3 format so it will not be cropped. Dont flame Funi for something they didn't do. (16:9 is 1.77:1.) So 5 stars cause this will be an awesome addition to any set,1381363200,9,210,4.146341463414634

8613455,5,B00F9IB1M4,"I'm mainly writing this review to clarify the whole thing about having DBZ with the Bruce Falconer music. His music was not added to the show until about halfway through the Namek saga. So for probably seasons 1 and 2 that music will not be a part of the series until about season 3.

For me personally I'm happy with the purchase. I did buy all 9 seasons and am happy that the cropping isn't as bad as the Orange Brick dvds. Would reccomend",1523750400,2,441,4.25
