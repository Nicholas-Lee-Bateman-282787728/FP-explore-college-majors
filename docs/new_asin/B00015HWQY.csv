This wasn't like any of the other alien movies i've seen and i've seen some wack-out ones. It kinda drags on a bit until the good parts come. Don't take my word on it though...you should still view it for yourself. You won't be disappointed, not if you're a fan of the Polonia Brother Films!",1469491200,,469,4.108695652173913
8006861,5,B00015HWQY,"This gem of a dvd used to be available for less than ten bucks, but for the past few years it has hovered around 23 bucks.  Having seen this ridiculous collection about 6 years ago, I had been jonesing to visit this corner of Poloniaville for awhile.  I lucked out and found it for five bucks used one day.  It hasn't left my DVD player for five days.  There is so much cheesy fun to be found here.  The commentaries, the interviews and of course, the films themselves are incredible displays of hilarious homemade video garbage.  Highest recommendation possible for lovers of bad videos.  Not movies, videos, as this was shot on VHS.",1395446400,,634,4.557522123893805
8006862,5,B00015HWQY,"If you want a sci-fi horror movie, this is terrible. If you want a group of friends laughing at a ridiculous B movie, it's just not gonna get much better than this.",1391126400,3,164,4.15625
8006863,1,B00015HWQY,"Just turn back now. Maybe you're reading this on accident. Press the back button on your browser and be on your way... On the other hand if you must see feeders, as another reviewer already mentioned, DO NOT WATCH FEEDERS 1. EVERYTHING FROM FEEDERS 1 IS IN FEEDERS 2. That being said, these films are the worst of the worst.  There are a few funny parts worth fast forwarding to, but that's all.  Otherwise you wait and wait for the movie to end. Its a good way to make 1.5 hours feel like 3 hours. I may never watch it again. Maybe when I'm 40, but I'm not looking forward to it.",1292889600,,580,4.169642857142857
8006864,3,B00015HWQY,"What new can be said about 'FEEDERS' that hasn't already been said, as far as warnings go.  Yes, it is horrible and by that I mean in a bad way, mostly.  What do you expect, it's done by the notorious low..low..low-budget Horror makers, the Polonia brothers with a little help from Jon McBride from 'Cannibal Campout' haha.  FEEDERS part-1 is really the only one I could handle and it brought a smile to my face.  I'm sorry, I just could not watch the 2 one all the way through in one sitting haha.  If you only like big-budget horrors and think Full Moon flicks are the lowiest of the low, than you better stay FAR AWAY from this as much as possible!  You seriously have to have an open mind when viewing this flick.  It was fun watching this and I'm proud to add it to the collection!  Oh!...you can watch part 2 around Christmas since it has a Christmas theme haha.",1260576000,,868,4.314814814814815
8006865,5,B00015HWQY,"Feeders is an incredibly entertaining and loveable film. It is a great example of the independent spirit of a couple guys who love movies, have day jobs, but still put forth the huge amount of time and effort to do what they love.

The film itself is incredibly amateurish with almost ZERO display of film making ability (at least at this point--the Polonias film making ability definitely gets better with time). Despite this fact, I honest to god find more joy and value in this film than ten generic Hollywood blockbusters put together.

Check Feeders out with some friends and prepare to have a crazy and memorable experience!",1219968000,2,630,4.824074074074074
8006866,5,B00015HWQY,"Yeah, Feeders is bad. Feeders 2 is even worse, if that's possible. But this movie was meant to be enjoyed with a six-pack and possibly a traumatic head injury to boot. As far as the DVD goes, it's excellent.  Chock full of special features, a hilarious commentary (mostly on the first one, the second is pretty much one guy saying how he thought the film was just stupid and the other guys defending it) and cool packaging, the Feeders DVD is a must for fans of campy, cheesy horror flicks.",1126310400,8,490,4.444444444444445
8006867,1,B00015HWQY,"It shocks me to see this DVD is out of print, mostly because it is possibly one of the single worst movies ever created. I'm not kidding. This movie is the cinematic equivilent of being beaten bloody with a billiard ball stuffed into a sock. It's like have your teeth pulled out by a mad scientist and replaced with screaming, burning imps. They also swear whenever you open your mouth. Better acting can be found on your local free cable channel.
Seriously, watching even a tiny part of this movie will make your head swell to unimaginable size as your brain attempts to commit suicide by slamming itself against the sides of your skull.
When you watch this, you'll say ""I could do better"". Well, you're probably right, since this movie looks like a high school film project complete with terrible acting, horrible ""special effects"" and ""monsters"".
This will surely cause brain damage.",1084752000,3,886,4.7973856209150325
8006868,5,B00015HWQY,"What goes up must come down, it has been said: and no fable, no story or grand narrative has ever challenged such an idiom -- until now. Watching ""Feeders"" is like laying on a beach and feeling the tide crash into you, being overcome by the foamy goodness and numerous starfish of aesthetic perfection. You cannot help but wonder at the twists and turns in plot, and inquire into the hallowed halls that must have carved up such a laviscious, tender beast from the rotting oak of the bygone Horror genre.
In this film, a debutante work par excellence, the cargenre reaches a climax and a triumph of cinematic and postmodern senisibilities. The black canvas of darkness ushered in to illustrate our nightmares gives one a sense of transvelescence, posphorescence, and evanescence thoroughly original - and audacious! - in its application.
A deft tribute to HP Lovecraft can be observed half-way through (watch for it!). To be sure, hommages can easily be seen also for King, Shelley, Kelly, Hardy, Christie, and Weiner. The subtext beneath the dialogue is one of depraved earnestness, and simple, as if the writers were in fact bufoons; to the untrained eye, one might be critical. But beneath it all there is a mischievous deconstruction of the terror of the sublime: a repudiation of all modernity.
I liked it.",1083024000,9,1311,4.883408071748879
