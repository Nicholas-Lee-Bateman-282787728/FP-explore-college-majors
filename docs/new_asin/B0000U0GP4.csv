8003074,2,B0000U0GP4,"This video has a few useful aspects to help a beginner learn how to handle a bike, corner and deal with hopping logs. Sadly, most of the video is composed of chatter and watching beginners do some boring drills, poorly. It would have been beneficial to see more of the pro's and more slow motion shots of people who actually know what they are doing. Sadly, there is not enough real content to help a beginner learn to ride. Most offensively, Mary English defines the things you need to do/have if you are going to mountain bike, including stretching and the all important need for a chiropractor (ehem, given that English herself is a chiropractor, this is nothing more than a shameless plug; what a disgrace). Not a total waste of money, but amateur stuff.",1202688000,3,758,4.622222222222222
8003075,4,B0000U0GP4,I bought this for my girlfriend as she was beginning to mtn bike and we both really like it. She feels more confident now and practices the drills shown in the movie. We will be watching it again before the next season starts.,1196985600,,226,4.27906976744186
8003076,5,B0000U0GP4,"Although targetd for women, this makes a good introduction to the sport for anyone. The producer and women in the video are obviously passionate about the sport. Lots of drills and techniques that anyone can take advantage of.

8003077,5,B0000U0GP4,"Although my own biking has been limited to road riding...I found this introduction to mountain biking interesting, informative...and even inspiring.  The video makes mountain biking far more accessible to the average weekend warrior than I had imagined...it does not necessarily have to be the  ""extreme sport"" I envisioned.  The segments on technique, bike selection and bike maintenance are all helpful and encouraging.
The producers have an affection for this sport and although the video is clearly directed toward women it will serve as an excellent introduction to anyone.  The overall sense is that mountain biking is not only a healthy outdoor activity but a lot of fun as well.",1068422400,6,686,5.26605504587156
8003078,4,B0000U0GP4,"A great way to get excited about mountain biking.  Easy to learn tips for the beginner, female or male, from world class mountain biker, Sue Haywood.  Will help you conquer your fear of riding off road.  Laid back friendly feel of the participants lends a unique perspective not usually seen in training videos.  Definitely worthwile for the novice off-road rider!",1068422400,6,364,5.016666666666667
