7948675,3,B00005OCLR,"Episode 4 is rather OK as we are introduced to Bancho who's voice in the Japanese version might seem familiar to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure fans as he is the guy who later on voiced Dio Brando in that series. His English dub voice is not nearly as good or grating. The Invaders plans are still very murky, what is their plan? To just cause random chaos everywhere and annoyances?

Episode 5 introduces running teenage gatekeeper girl Kaoru who at first refuses to be a part of the group before ultimately deciding to join it anyway. Partly because she decides she really wants to get with Shun suddenly. Oh dear god this show's harem is getting bigger. She also dresses absurdly always in her running gym outfit, it basically becomes her uniform for the rest of the show. It is OK.

Episode 6 is really kind of stupid, the team members fight over who wants to be the team captain and ultimately Shun gets the position and we have some Scooby Doo style garbage at a girl's dormitory with ghosts that turn out to not be ghosts. There's no real Invaders or anything in this episode, this is just filler and it's rather awful.",1508976000,,1120,4.512315270935961

7948677,5,B00005OCLR,"1.) Episode 4 - Finding a New Warrior - The trio (Reiko being the new addition) are on a mission to look into another potential Gatekeeper: Tyoutarou Banba, also known as Bancho. When Reiko gets lost along the way, it's up to Shun and Ruriko to test if Bancho is indeed a gate keeper. Shun becomes convinced that Bancho is a gate keeper, though Bancho never actually displays the ability, and Bancho ends up tagging along with them to help when invaders are reported to be attacking a rally organized by Bancho's mentor.

2.) Episode 5 - Run Towards Your Dream! - A.E.G.I.S. introduces the Gatekeepers to a potential recruit, Kaoru Konoe. She demonstrates amazing athletic skill, but she surprises them by saying she refuses to join A.E.G.I.S. Shun, along with the rest of the team, try to convince her to join, but she doesn't want to, because she doesn't see the point if she's ""going to win anyway"". When she witnesses an attack by invaders, however, she might just change her mind...

3.) Episode 6 - After a particularly disorganized battle, Shirei decides the team needs a captain and sets elections for the next meeting. Shun, Ruriko and Megane are front runners after the coveted position. Meanwhile, there are strange happenings going on in Kaoru and Reiko's dormitory, and only they seem to have noticed. The gate keepers are on the case, motivated by the fact that whoever solves the mystery will most likely be elected as the team captain.

In this DVD you get another AEGIS card of Shun and the cover continues to have the reverse Japanese cover. The animation is still very superior to other series. This disc also managed to keep up the energy and feel of the first couple of episodes nicely, even with things being the typical plot of bringing in more teammates. It really comes down to the old adage of there being nothing new to tell, but an infinite number of ways to tell it. It's all about the execution of the story, and Gatekeepers succeeds in spades.",1028332800,3,1974,4.68299711815562
7948678,3,B00005OCLR,"Oh, I never mentioned the extras they give you in the first DVD. Well, you get two ikkle AEGIS cards: one for you and one for Ruriko. (However, you only get one in the second DVD, and that's Shun's.) The other cool stuff is on the DVD itself. You'll get to look at line drawings (they should have more of these) and more graphics. Pretty alright.
But the episode introducing Bancho is a bit of a bore. You feel as if the GateKeeper of Time has decided to torture you in a timeloop and the episode seems to go on forever... But Bancho's a funny guy, so maybe that'll help things move along. You're given an ounce more of information from Shirei, as well as learning his ultimate pet peeve; and two more GateKeepers are discovered. You'll feel the frustration of Ruriko interviewing... (man, I've forgotten her name!)... Piano Girl every time she pops up in an episode. And the strange thing is... She doesn't do anything! She doesn't mess up like Shun or go all out like Ruriko! She just shrugs and cheerleads! Koaru's pretty different and, due to either my misinterpretation or a foggy translation of the Japanese script, hard to understand when it comes to explaining her lack of GateKeeping entusiasm.
Once Kaoru's on the scene, the love triangle is born. And the Invaders just keep on coming...",1016841600,2,1297,4.619047619047619
