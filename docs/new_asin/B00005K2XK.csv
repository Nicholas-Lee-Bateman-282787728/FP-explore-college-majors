1614161,4,B00005K2XK,"Yes, this DVD is comprehensive and informative.  BUT, at three hours long, don't expect other family members to share your level of interest and enthusiasm.  (And they might have seen some of the movie clips before.)",1281225600,3,216,4.972222222222222
1614162,5,B00005K2XK,"Most WW2 documentaries simply rehash some of the more prominent points of a particular event. Then again, it's hard to cover any battle account in depth in a matter of the standard 30 to 60 minutes as most documentaries go.
 This account clocks in at almost 3 hours but you would never know it. It covers the Guadalcanal campaign quite thoroughly, yet moves along at a pace that doesn't leave you wondering when it will end, as some documentaries are prone to.
 This is quite simply one of the best documentaries of any WW2 military battle and will leave you feeling that you have gotten the most for your money. I would highly recommend it to both WW2 buffs or novice wanting to understand this important campaign.",1269043200,2,715,4.622047244094488
1614163,4,B00005K2XK,"This is a well documented history of the Guadalcanal campaign. There are numerous interviews with former Marines, Seabees and historians plus narration. Unfortunately, most of the ships involved in the naval battles are shown only in photos, not video. Some of the video is stock WWII and out of historical sequence relative to this campaign.",1246665600,4,342,5.236363636363636
1614164,5,B00005K2XK,"I have read and tried to understand the Pacific theatre from the very beginning,i.e early 1942,so while reading the book,The Cactus Air Force, by Thomas G, Miller, I have used this DVD and found that this added the facts and illustrations to what I was reading .A top quality DVD with clear genuine footage.",1244592000,3,307,4.703703703703703
1614165,5,B00005K2XK,This was a very informative DVD with an excellent detailed account of the Guadalcanal battle. It was a bloody struggle against a tenacious Japanese enemy. To hear the interviews with the veterens of the battle really brings out the true story of this great combined land and sea battle at the early stage of the war. It always make me proud of our US military heritage to learn of the brave and spirited fighting men of the 1st Marines and Navy. General Vandergrift was one of our finest military leaders.,1230249600,4,505,4.622222222222222
1614166,5,B00005K2XK,"You can see that there was a lot of effort and ambition put to this project and I must confess I find it a lot better than most American Documentaries, in that there is no repetition or strange pauses indicating commercial breaks.

This is a project done for the sake of the project and not to get a few dollars on the cheap. It follows the 1st Marines chronologically from the time they leave the US to New Zealand where they were scheduled for 6 months training but where soon sent of to fight a war in a campaign in Solomon Islands where neither side had planned for. Then the documentary follows events like they unfolded. This was a dangerous time and the outcome was far from certain in the opening months. The Japanese were at the zenith of conquest and the US was emerging as a military superpower.

The Guadalcanal Campaign is a very interesting one, it involves land, sea and air battles between two evenly matched enemies in very inhospitable terrain. Both sides score minor victories and suffer defeats but for a long time neither gets the upper hand.

It was at Guadalcanal that WW2 Marine Corps was Forged. The officers serving in the Campaign became its leaders and showed that they learned their lessons well and the Marines fighting there became their veteran core.

The documentary is a perfect blend of documentary footage (some very impressive), narration, scolary observations and the all important interviews with the veterans themselves.

I have no reservations to giving this 5 stars for it is easily among the best. I would also recommend ""Fighting Lady"" a contemporary documentary about a WW2 Aircraft Carrier.",1223164800,11,1636,4.807829181494662
1614167,5,B00005K2XK,"I'm an American History nut, and this is hands down the best documentary I've ever seen on any WWII battle or campaign.",1209945600,11,119,4.454545454545454
1614168,5,B00005K2XK,"This DVD covered the Guadalcanal Campaign in a very clear manner with a minimum of distractions.  Most of it was drawn from contemporary combat photography and had many scenes that I had not seen before, along with some that were more familiar.  It will be useful to students of that time in history.",1186531200,21,300,4.6415094339622645
1614229,3,B00005K2XK,"Every video of Guadalcanal have the same sea battle scenes. I wanted to see land based combat photography+. The battle for Bloody Nose Ridge could have been done with graphics and narrative to give a more interest in this important battle.

1614230,3,B00005K2XK,"This CD was a disappointment.  It is only fair.  Some of the film is from other battles in the Pacific, and some of the best film of Guadalcanal from the past, was not used.  Too bad.",1377993600,,183,4.027777777777778

1614232,4,B00005K2XK,"This video is a good documentary about what happened at Guadalcanal.

1614234,5,B00005K2XK,For those World War II fans and history buffs this DVD would make a fine addition to your collection. The battle for Guadalcanal is very detailed in both the events leading up to the battle and the strategy used by both opposing forces. The war footage was excellent as was the commentary by those who were there. A very good all round film I recommend it.,1344729600,,356,4.409090909090909
1614235,1,B00005K2XK,"I was under impressed by this presentation.  The dialogue is a direct lift from the fabulous ""Victory At Sea"" series. If you get that series you will be better off.  I would not recommend this particular rendition.",1306281600,2,214,4.756756756756757
