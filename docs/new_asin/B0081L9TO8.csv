5118569,5,B0081L9TO8,This particular season is his best yet! Always so reflective on the places he visits and things he sees! A must have!,1370131200,,117,4.363636363636363
5118570,4,B0081L9TO8,"One of the better seasons with a better introspection of countries not often traveled.  Great insight into Haiti after the devastating earthquake, Cuba (where casual travel from the United States is not allowed) and the amazingly creatively sophisticated but now defunct El Bulli in Spain.  BUT as a ""collection"" versus being a complete ""season"", this collection is missing San Francisco and US Desert episodes.  Another thing still bugs me is that on a consumer purchased DVD versus a broadcast airing of the show, we as consumers should be able to hear what the *bleep* Tony is saying in the uncensored DVD- or at least be able to select the G version or uncensored version of what was originally said.  Of course, no bonus features such as online Travel Channel content that has since been deleted on ""what Tony really thinks"" or outtakes.  You think by now the Travel Channel, Zero Point Zero or Image Entertainment would put out a complete quality product versus what cousin Ted cranked out of his basement in his spare time.",1367280000,9,1030,4.862857142857143

5118572,5,B0081L9TO8,My husband and I love to watch Anthony Bourdain and this is a great series of travels.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.,1366588800,,113,4.380952380952381
5118573,4,B0081L9TO8,I really like Anthony Bourdain. He goes to ordinary places around the world. He'll eat anything! With a local to take him around to street venders and other less known places he eats food prepared by farm people and fishermen and hunters and talks to them about their lives and politics and how they cook.  So interesting and not a fancy restaurant tour.,1361232000,2,354,4.619047619047619
5118574,5,B0081L9TO8,"Very much enjoyed the whole series, the different countries and cultures, food, people and also Anthony's humor. Recommending to all adventurous people, adventure while sitting on the couch, but it will make you hungry.",1359158400,,219,5.470588235294118
5118575,5,B0081L9TO8,Yet again another awesome set of episodes.  Bourdain continues to amaze on his No Reservations.  This guy will eat anything!  What a saga everybody!  What. A. Saga!,1358208000,,164,4.962962962962963
5118576,5,B0081L9TO8,"Loved his show when on A&E, now another chance to enjoy his shows now that he is off the air",1357776000,,92,3.65
5118577,4,B0081L9TO8,I will start by saying that No Reservations is a favorite of mine. Season 7 was great and I give it 4 stars only because there are some better season compilations. Good stuff.,1356825600,,175,4.333333333333333
5118578,5,B0081L9TO8,"The last season of No Reservations may have well been the show's best.  You can see why Anthony Bourdain is moving to CNN from the Travel Channel as the show has become less about actual travel and mainly about the culture and politics of the places he's seeing.  The Haiti episode featuring Sean Penn was as insightful as any I've seen about the devastation from the 2010 earthquake.  The Cuba show illustrated the poverty created by the Castro regime among the majority of the island's citizens.  Even the look at the Ozarks delved more into the culture of the region than food.  Those looking for a more straight travel show, the Vienna episode has gorgeous snow covered scenery and Mr. Bourdain chowing down on all manner of meats and chocolates.  The Cajun show has Mr. Bourdain going Tony Soprano on a pig and is one of the best episodes the series has ever produced.",1341878400,19,873,4.636363636363637
8524078,5,B0081L9TO8,"Not the same as his Without Borders series.  Production values from the Travel Channel are as awful as the CNN series is great.  But Bourdain is  Bourdain, a wonderful guide to food, history, culture, and if you love him on Without Borders, you'll love him on this.",1520208000,,265,4.595744680851064

8524085,5,B0081L9TO8,"This is the beast season yet. One thing I noticed is that Tony is evolving from a ""food guy"" into more of a seasoned world traveller. Not only does he tell you about the great foods of the country and the interesting sights to see but now he is getting more into the politics and history of the country as well. For example in Haiti, actor Sean Penn joins him to discuss the humanitarian efforts after the earthquake there. Here are some of the episodes:

Haiti - Tony decides it might be a good idea to give some food to the starving people around him. A riot almost breaks out. Sean Penn gives him a tour of the area. I think many will gain some respect for Sean Penn when they see what he is doing there.

Cambodia - Tony returns to Cambodia 10 years later but this time he really gets into what happened during the Vietnam War. One of his guests tells about how her home was destroyed by the Khmer Rouge. The food looks wonderful. He gets a funny looking haircut.

Nicaragua - Tony discusses the Oliver North situation with the Contras. He tells one of his guests that this is how most Americans know about Nicaragua. Tony meets with a guy who owns a famous hotel. I think this was the epsiode where Tony sees kids picking through garbage dumps for food and seems moved by this. Some of the kids were the same age as his daughter.

Vienna - Tony decides beforehand that he is going to hate this place. Then falls in love with it as one guest after another takes him for great food and drink. Now he is in the holiday spirit. He even enjoys the sacher torte (chocolate cake) which Vienna is known for.

Ozarks - they eat squirrels, racoon etc. They also go fishing, racoon hunting and duck hunting. The racoon outsmarts them and they come home empty that night. They also have a terrible accident while fishing at night. One of the guests is injured.

Brazil - The Amazon - Tony and the guys have a sort of fun trip to the Amazon to catch some huge fish. But his back is killing him and they have some issues flying due to the weather. The experience is more fun for him looking back on, than it was going through it. His local guide is also a bit nuts.

Boston - Tony and a musician friend explore South Boston (Southie). They eat and drink a lot (what a surprise). They eat seafood at a good restaurant, omelets and hash at a diner, drink Guiness etc. Tony also meets with a local radio host to discuss the mob in Boston. Then they have a great deli sandwich and a meal of clams and pork. They also get beaten at candlepin bowling by some locals.

Hokaido (Japan) - Tony goes to Hokaido, an island in Northern Japan. It is cold and snowy there. But it doesn't matter because the food and locals are great.

I really feel like I got my moneys worth here. Enjoy.",1403827200,,2765,4.27151051625239

8524087,4,B0081L9TO8,Where are the US Desert and Holiday Special episodes for season 7?  I am baffled as to why they wouldn't be included.,1383696000,5,117,4.318181818181818
