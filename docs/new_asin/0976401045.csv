174134,5,0976401045,"Susy Dorn has an amazing voice and a gift for making learning fun. My four year old cannot get enough of this dvd. When she finishes singing the song about the planets, she immediately wants to watch the whole dvd again. We sing the songs together, since the words are printed at the bottom for mom (who is a text-based learner). My daugher is picking up an amazing amount of Spanish and even my entirely gringa accent is improving.

Worth the money.",1163721600,2,450,4.487804878048781
174135,5,0976401045,"Suzy has taken the art of teaching a language through song and dance to a new level.  This DVD is not only great for our children, but it helps us adults to refresh our High school spanish too!

Great, great, awesome!",1163548800,,217,4.2682926829268295
174136,5,0976401045,"My son can't get enough of Susy's new DVD.  He's always loved Susy's 1st DVD, Cantemos en Espanol, and now he always asks for the ""new one"".  He loves Sal y Pimienta and I enjoy singing along with the songs as well.",1163203200,,215,4.095238095238095
174137,5,0976401045,We just got this DVD a week ago and it is already getting worn out.  My son (2 years old) wants to watch it everyday!  Highly recommend it for children and adults wanting to learn Spanish.,1162771200,,188,4.194444444444445
174138,5,0976401045,"I think I was more exicted than my daughter when Susy's new ""Sal y Pimienta"" DVD came out!  At last, a new video to be able to interchange with ""Cantemos en Espanol!""  My 3 year old daughter just LOVES Susy's music and is just mesmerized by her DVD's.  The 15 month old baby is even hypnotized by the DVD and she babbles along with the music in the car!

Susy's Spanish immersion music in her DVD's and CD's are so captivating and fun for the kids.. My husband and I often find ourselves singing to the music too!",1161907200,,513,4.204081632653061
7794724,5,0976401045,Susy knows what she's doing it. We've watched this a bunch of times over the years and the kids still enjoy it. Now my kids watch it with their friends at church.,1372723200,,162,4.09375
7794725,5,0976401045,"Susy Dorn is an excelent singer and has done a great job composing simple, yet appealing songs for kids who are learning Spanish.  The DVD is a very nice adition when using one of her songs to teach Spanish and the students looove to watch a video after they have been practicing and learning all the vocabulary from a song.  Buen Trabajo Susy!!!",1299110400,,346,4.476190476190476
7794726,5,0976401045,"... and that's why it is getting 5 stars despite one fairly major complaint. First of all the positives: the songs for learning Spanish vocabulary are awesome. I can't think of a more effective way of learning, both for my son and for myself. I find myself singing the little songs to myself and learning a lot, and Spanish is completely new to me. Susy Dorn really has a good understanding of how to teach and I bet she is wonderful live. My son really likes this DVD and asks for it to be played again when we get to the end. Now for the complaint.. I really wish she had hooked up with someone a little better at creating the graphics and putting it all together. It looks pretty amateurish, especially since we're used to watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whistlefritz/dp/B0014WJ4NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whistlefritz</a>, another Spanish immersion series I love. The biggest drawback of this is that it's not always easy for my 21 month old to know what they are talking about because the graphic of the animal (or whatever) is not very good. I can figure it out, and sometimes I'll say what it is in English so my son understands, but it would be nice if it was clearer in the video. Some pictures of real animals, etc. would be nice too - it's all puppets and graphics, and too busy sometimes. Despite this flaw, get it. For Susy and the songs alone it is very much worth it.",1250726400,,1437,4.798387096774194
7794727,5,0976401045,"This is the absolute best series of Spanish Immersion videos.  Seriously, I love to sing the songs, and I've learned so much spanish between Susy Dorn's videos and The Whistlefritz videos.  Both my kids get up and dance when they see this.",1218758400,,239,4.666666666666667
7794728,5,0976401045,"This video is great for kids/parents who know some Spanish or for those who want to immerse in Spanish. Suzy has a great castillian (Spain Spanish) accent and is easy to listen to. She sings catchy songs and annonciates very clearly! The video does not look home-made, but can appear cheesy to some -- my son who is 3 eats it up!!! Suzy breaks it apart by topic (i.e. balls, food, manners, planets, animal sounds, etc). She intorduces a few words with the help of puppets and then they sing a catchy, short song that repeats twice. She always wears a big red nose and in all the songs she is wearing a different costumer or hat. THere are drawn graphics around here that make it ""look"" like balls are falling, she is riding a space shuttle, etc. It is great to get kids to listen to a variety or vocab in Spanish.

Este video es bueno para introducir muchas palabras en Espanol. Suzy usa un accento de Espana en sus canciones. Todas las canciones estan en grupos (planetas, concina, animales, etc.). Suzy usa titeres y siempre lleva una nariz roja de payaso y en cada cancion lleva un differente vestuario. Es gracioso y a mi hijo de 3 anos le encanta!",1217980800,2,1152,4.433962264150943
7794729,5,0976401045,I just love this DVD and find myself singing and humming the songs throughout the day after watching it with my 16 month old.  My son loves it too and I love how much he is learning.  Suzy has a wonderful voice and makes learning so fun for my son.  I love that the video is entertaining enough for me that I don't mind watching it over and over again with my son and then teaching him the things we have both learned throughout the day.  Great DVD!  Can't wait for the next release.,1203033600,,483,4.095744680851064
7794730,5,0976401045,"My 2 yr old loved this DVD. At first I was skeptical at how much he could learn and how he would understand since this DVD is completely in Spanish.

My son and I watched this together and he was able to get the gist of alot of it. He knows that estoy feliz means I'm happy, Estoy asustado means I'm scared. Etc.

His favorite song is Sal Y Pimienta. He might not understand everything in Spanish...(heck he doesn't understand everything in English yet anyways!) but he sings the song with perfect pronunciation!

 Susy really has a gift for connecting with kids and making Spanish fun, not only for kids but we adults as well. I find myself singing the songs in the shower, at work,etc and find myself learning more Spanish vocabulary as well!

My son asks for this video everyday since receiving it. He loves singing and dancing to these Spanish songs. I am very sold on the immersion method after viewing these DVD's and plan to buy more of Susy's products.",1198195200,,960,4.494252873563219
7794731,5,0976401045,"Susy Dorn has an amazing way with kids.  Her video's and CD's keep kids attention as they are LEARNING.  It's the best I have ever seen for my 2 and 5 year old.  I have seen many because I am determined to have my kids another language because I didn't.  The funny thing is that I am learning too.  Even if you think you found another way to learn Spanish, you would have to have this one too.  It's just too much fun not to have.",1197072000,2,430,3.941860465116279
7794732,3,0976401045,"Good songs and a lot of them, however it looks like it was filmed with a handycam. Pretty ""home made"". It holds my kids attention for quite awhile anyway and they enjoy the songs. I just think they would be more likely to make it to the end of the dvd occasionally if it were professional looking. Kids get tired of home videos too apparently.",1187136000,3,343,4.292307692307692
7794733,5,0976401045,"My 2 and 4 year olds can't get enough of teacher Susy!  I have borrowed many Spanish videos from the library before, but this is by far the BEST DVD for learning Spanish.  Susy uses puppetry, adult enjoyable music, and lots of visuals in her DVD.  There's also subtitles to help kids/adults who read.",1172102400,,300,4.518518518518518
