8073278,3,B000A2XD5W,"Sci-fighters (1996) is a low-budget Sci-fi that doesn't go anywhere. It borrows heavily from Blade Runner (1982), Runaway (1984), The Hidden (1987), and I Come in Peace (1990). It has a nice feeling to it with the low-budget attempts at a futuristic world, but the problem is the horrible acting of Roddy Piper and a baffling performance by Billy Drago.

Roddy Piper was okay in John Carpenter's They Live (1988) but he is just unlikeable here. Billy Drago is like a drug addict here, messy and annoying. In The Untouchables (1987) he was fine, but he is a weak bad guy here, invaded by a parasite and stumbles along. Neither Roddy Piper or Billy Drago can carry a film, even a low-budget Sci-fi one.

The plot is ludicrous as well.

8073281,4,B000A2XD5W,"""Warnings From Space"" is a DVD of three diverse sci-fi movies, only two of which are even tangentially related to space. Emblazoned on the deluxe DVD packaging is ""Limited Edition Hologram Cover,"" which is entirely true. I don't have a clue what connection the hologram art has with the DVD, but it is a hologram. The disc is a great value, which is why it earned a four star rating. It is far from perfect, though. The transfer is poor, especially on ""Zontar,"" where it is far worse than other copies I have seen. ""Slipstream"" also has some minor transfer defects, but ""Sci-Fighters"" actually looks pretty good. The films cover thirty years of science fiction filmmaking and a lot of cinematic history from ""Zontar: The Thing From Venus"" (1966) to ""Sci-Fighters"" (1996.)

""Zontar: The Thing From Venus"" is one of my favorite cheesy sci-fi movies from the 1960s. It was made by Larry Buchanan in 1966 as a remake of ""It Conquered The World"", which is itself an enjoyable bit of B-Grade cinema. By all estimates the remake is horribly inferior to the original, but ""Zontar"" makes up for in silliness and bogus science what it lacks in quality production values. The most notable difference between ""Zontar"" and ""It Conquered The World"" is the monster. Zontar looks like a three-eyed, hooded Sleestak with pincher jaws, whereas the original monster looked like an enraged carrot.

The story concerns Keith, a brilliant lunatic scientist (Tony Huston) who conspires to bring Zontar from his home planet to help the people of Earth become more peaceful. His friend, Curt (the always gentlemanly John Agar) thinks he is nuts and eventually convinces him that he must destroy Zontar, who has taken up residence in a local cave because ""it is close to his Venus environment"". (Sure.) Zontar attempts to take over the world by launching ""injectapods"" at people which fly to their victims and implant a pin in their neck making them a biological sub-unit of Zontar. (Following all this?) I love watching the injectapods fly, and you will too when you watch this movie.

After much bloodshed and panic in the streets (sample exchange after the power has gone out: ""My husband's in an iron lung, what shall I do?""...now that's dialogue you don't see in just any film,) Keith finally dispatches Zontar with a ""Plutonium-Ruby Crystal Beam Gun"" which involves the funniest special effect I have ever seen on film. The movie concludes with a real Ed Wood moment of solemn pondering about the future of mankind.

In a nutshell, this is a great piece of cheese. Sure it's silly, Sure it is ludicrous watching Keith speak to Zontar via some radio gear that just goes ""Bwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwu"" over an over. But if you are looking for an excellent piece of mid 1960s paranoid sci-fi lunacy, ""Zontar: The Thing From Venus"" would be tough to beat, and it is easily my favorite film of the three. Sadly they don't make movies like this anymore.

""Slipstream"" is a little-known science fiction epic that has dizzying high and low points. Made in Turkey in some of the most visually interesting terrain imaginable, the film is set after environmental calamity in the future, and sort of resembles a cross between ""Blade Runner,"" ""Lost Continent,"" ""Mad Max,"" ""North by Northwest,"" and ""48 Hours."" The plot has all kinds of things going on from man-versus-machine and ""what does it mean to be human?"" angles, to explorations of good and evil (are the police always right to seek out murderers?) There's romance, there are tons of light aircraft, and there is a hidden civilization right where you'd least expect it. In other words, the film has sparks of genius, but is all over the place.

After some ponderous narration about the ecological disaster that overtook Earth sets the scene, Will Tasker (Mark Hamill) is introduced as a cop determined to bring admitted killer and android Byron (Bob Peck) to justice. Doing this proves more difficult than he imagined, particularly when young, cocky, and belligerent Matt Owens (Bill Paxton) shows up and kidnaps Byron for reward money: the chasing then commences. Before it's over Byron and Owens predictably become friends, while it becomes more and more obvious that Tasker is so devoted to his job as a cop that he forgets what justice is all about. Byron also falls in love and learns what it is to have emotions; equally predictably, he likes it. The concepts are actually good, but one key problem is that even though individual components of the plot are good, the bigger elements are extremely predictable. Who didn't know that Byron would learn emotion as soon as it was revealed he was an android? Who couldn't see that Tasker had to be the bad guy as soon as Byron became a sympathetic character?

There are numerous distractions in the film that really detracted from it. First, the cast is fine (even Ben Kingsley has a small role,) but evidently the direction took them over the top sometimes. Hamill was great in most places, but when he tangles with Paxton and Peck (the core drama of the film) he gets uncharacteristically hammy (notably ridiculous is the unique aviation duel to the death of Hamill and Peck.) Paxton is by far the worst offender here, and has some of the worst dialogue in the very uneven script to deal with. There are scenes where he does great work, but at other points he just chews the scenery. The one constant in the film is Bob Peck: he turns in an absolutely brilliant performance, and is largely responsible for making the film an enjoyable experience. He is such a nuanced actor, and he really sells the premise while making the android the most human and interesting character in the picture. The film is definitely worth seeing just for Peck's performance.

The picture has some great sets, but has some silly special effects and concepts, the most eye-rolling of which is the world's biggest (and scariest) box kite. There are other lapses that are fairly egregious including Ed Wood-like alternating weather edits of what appears to be a sirocco and a pleasant spring day somewhere in Scotland. Worst of all is Elmer Bernstein's insipid soundtrack full of grating 1980's-tainted music. I am normally a fan of Bernstein, but this is not his best work.

""Slipstream"" is a relatively high-concept movie handicapped by a script that can't subtly hide the future direction of the movie and some intermittent hammy performances. When it's bad it's really bad, but when it's good, it's really good, and most of the latter is due to the performance from the late Bob Peck.

""Sci-Fighters"" is a dark little morsel of post-apocalyptic Canadian sci-fi cheese. The movie begins in a prison on the moon where Adrian Dunn (career evildoer Billy Drago) gets the bad end of the deal in a circular saw fight (how long are those cords, anyway?) In the process he gets infected with an alien virus that his corpse brings back to Earth. The virus enables Dunn to come back to life, which results in no end of difficulty in Boston. Not that there aren't enough problems; after all in the ""future"" of 2009 (!) the Earth is enveloped in darkness 24 hours a day, a phenomena called ""Econight."" After an homage to ""Alien"" with a gratuitous ""squids-from-the-torso"" scene, it is revealed that Drago, an insane killer even before the death defying viral assault on his senses, is killing and infecting people. Worse, the virus is unknown and makes people start producing methane to ""terraform"" Earth, thereby ruining its atmosphere for current terrestrial life, but enabling a methane-breathing race of aliens to take over the planet.

The good guys are Detective Cameron Grayson (former wrestling champion ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper) and Doctor Kirbie Younger (Jayne Heitmeyer,) a virologist assigned to the case. Piper, known for his wild antics and Scottish trappings in the ring is actually quite good in the film. Drago has fallen a few notches down the career ladder since his ultimately convincing performance as Frank Nitti in ""The Untouchables,"" but he is still ultra-creepy here. The rest of the cast, and particularly Heitmeyer, are not up to the standards of Piper and Drago. The other problem is that the film is very plodding in places, and suffers from a worse than normal batch of plot contrivances that take forever to unfold and are wholly unbelievable. The worst example of this is in Grayson's past. We know that Grayson wears a wedding ring, but seems single; we also know that he is obsessed with Dunn. It's obvious that something is lurking there. At about 75 minutes into the picture we finally get the backstory we need: Grayson and Dunn were police academy graduates and best friends. Grayson then went off and married Dunn's ex-girlfriend, Katie, with whom Dunn was still obsessed. Two days after their wedding Dunn killed Katie while Grayson was at work. Oh, and did I mention that Dr. Younger looks like Katie, complicating the manhunt when the movie gets around to it.

After chasing Drago around the darkened streets of Boston, the film comes to a close in a warehouse with Grayson, Dunn, and Younger all doing their predictable parts. Dunn keeps calling Younger ""Katie"" and over-emoting in general as he attempts to have his way with her. Of course Grayson intervenes, and a three-way brawl erupts in, on, and around the warehouse, using heavy munitions and a forklift in exciting ways. Grayson wants to shoot Dunn, but Younger says that he'll explode due to all the methane he's holding inside him, so Younger ends up solving the problem in a more enlightened way. I was personally hoping that Grayson would simply pin Dunn with his signature figure four leglock after an inverted atomic drop! There is obvious chemistry between Grayson and Younger, but I have to give the filmmakers kudos for making the romance angle work out differently than expected. What I don't give them kudos for was Younger's outfit at the end of the movie: she's going to accept a prestigious job as the head of virology at the biggest institute in the country and she's wearing a ridiculous outfit consisting of a bulky pink turtleneck and a miniskirt. What? What temperature is it supposed to be? How old is she supposed to be?

Some of the acting is better than expected from Canadian films of this budget and genre (especially from Piper,) but some other the performances were pretty off key as well. The script was generally predictable, and I never need to hear Billy Drago say ""Katie"" ever again. Sets and locations were generally good, but the action scenes were tepid (although Piper on the scaffolding was tense.) The entire vision of the future was not dissimilar from many other (better) post-apocalyptic movies, but I have to wonder for a film made in 1996, why did the filmmakers only pick a future thirteen years ahead, knowing full well that it would be quickly obsolete? In the end I considered how entertaining was the film for its genre. Despite the relatively strong lead actors, the film was slow, burdened with unnecessary and distracting plot elements (the Econight, for instance,) middling effects and action sequences, and ultimately was not that absorbing of a story. Piper and Drago carry the film. The rest smells like methane.",1293580800,2,11197,4.868310598111227
8073282,4,B000A2XD5W,"I love films that are ""so bad, they're good"". Low production values, and lousy transfers keep me from giving this 5 stars. ZONTAR: The Thing from Venus is a remake of Roger Corman's far-superior ""It Conquered the World"" (not available on DVD), though if they thought they improved on the original, they are sorely mistaken. Anthony Houston hams it up unforgivably in the Lee Van Cleef role; John Agar is no match for Peter Graves; and sorely missing is the great Beverly Garland. The quality of transfer is really bad, worst of the three. SLIPSTREAM was the most enjoyable, mostly because of a wonderful performance from Bob Peck. Mark Harmon is almost unrecognizable, Kitty Aldridge is tuff as nails, and Bill Paxtom hams it up worse than most of the roles for which he's known. I liked the plot, and the developments; cameos from Ben Kingsley, F. Murray Abraham & Robbie Coltrane. I enjoyed it; a bittersweet ending. Best of the three. SCI-FIGHTERS was OK, with a really strong performance from Roddy Piper, and Billy Drago is a laff-riot as the bad guy (not intentionally). Part zombie, part Tarzan and part caveman, it's hard to tell which direction he'll go next. There are plenty of really bad films that are simply trash; there are redeeming qualities in each of these, though they're all pretty bad, especially ZONTAR. I guess I liked them because I wasn't bored. That says a lot. Make popcorn, kick back, and forget everything you may have learned about great film-making ...and enjoy. At the price, you could do a lot worse.",1234483200,3,1534,4.7924528301886795
