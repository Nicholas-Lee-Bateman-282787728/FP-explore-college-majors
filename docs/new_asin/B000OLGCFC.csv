2797376,4,B000OLGCFC,"But at times, this show it outright H-I-L-A-R-I-O-U-S!! Miley is so dramatic, and her friend isn't much better. Today, I saw the Jonas Brothers episode, and it was so funny, and I stayed glued to the tube. I can't help, but fall for this show's silly charm! And her Dad, is S-C-R-U-M-P-T-I-O-U-S. Let's just get THAT outta the way NOW.

Long story short, the Jonas brother, received a hit song in the making, from Miley's Dad, and Miley herself, got this super-genius idea to smash all that they (JBs) were going to achieve with that first single, and eventually the album. Her and her friend, decide to dress up as Dudes, and totally just mess everything up. They come out ready to rock, and start singing the song that was planned for the JBs. Nick and his brothers' jaws drop, and they consult Billy, to be sure this isn't some scary nightmare;

They get found out, and Miley and her friend look so stupid. Worth watching!

2797379,4,B000OLGCFC,"""Hannah Montana-Pop Star Profile"" takes four episodes of the highly popular Disney Channel series and boxes them into one disc which includes a brief feature on Miley Cyrus (Hannah/Miley Stewart) and a concert performance from the series.  The four episodes focus on the relationship between Hannah and her secret crush, Jake Ryan (Cody Linley).  For those unaware, Miley is the daughter of Billy Ray Cyrus of ""Achy Breaky Heart"" fame.  Sure, that was his first and biggest hit, but there's a whole lot more to the man than that one song.  He struggled for a long time with his band in order to make it.  Unfortunately the Nashville machine destroyed a wonderful star before he really ever got started with his commercial success.  Those years of struggle (and some solid values) bleed through on this DVD and the TV series as a whole.  Cyrus' daughter doesn't dress or act like a tramp, respects her dad and other elders (as witnessed with her interaction with the legendary Dolly Parton who shows up as her aunt on one of the episodes), and is generally a very good kid.  That, my friend, is rare in Hollywood these days.

The tween and early teen stars of the show are actually very fun to watch, and pull off some very comedic moments for kids and adults without having to make vulgar remarks or resort to sophomoric humor to get a laugh.  Yes, it can get silly and giggly at times, but that's what life is like for youngsters between the ages of ten and fourteen.  Cast members include Emily Osment (Lilly), Mitchel Musso (Oliver), Billy Ray Cyrus (Robbie) and Jason Earles as Miley's goofy brother, Jackson.

To top things off, the music featured in the series is actually very good pop music.  It's clean, inoffensive pop that's never boring.  Heck, I catch myself singing ""Best Of Both Worlds"" sometimes.

The bottom line is this:  If you don't want your daughter (or son) copying the bratty, questionable looks and behavior of Avril Lavigne, Ashlee Simpson, or any other soon-to-be-former pop princesses, give ""Hannah Montana"" a shot.  It's fun for the whole family.",1186358400,15,2075,4.783707865168539

2797381,2,B000OLGCFC,"Plainly and simply, the contents of this DVD to not live up to the commercials on Disney Channel.

The ads are filled with hype about all the extra features, especially the exclusive look at Miley's personal life. The exclusive look is in fact a really - REALLY - quick peek, as it is nothing more than a 5 minute featurette. The other extra is just a Hannah Montana music video, and I won't count the never ending string of previews as extras because they are nothing but ads for other Disney products.

Aside from the less than 10 minutes of bonus material, there are four complete episodes of Hannah Montana. That's great - if you don't have Disney Channel and can't see all of the same episodes several times a week already.

I will say that Hannah Montana is a great show that my whole family enjoys. In fact, the quality of the show is what keeps me from giving this DVD a 1 star rating. However, it did not live up to the expectations set by Disney's advertisments, and was nowhere near worth the money spent on it.",1185321600,7,1022,4.396825396825397
2797382,5,B000OLGCFC,"If you've got a 'tween- or teen-age girl, ""Hannah Montana"" is a sitcom you WANT her to watch. It's written at her level, it teaches good lessons, and it's funny.

The Disney Channel show concerns the double life of Miley Stewart, a smart -- but not all that popular -- brunette 8th grader who at night secretly dons a blond wig to become Hannah Montana, a famous pop singer. The series stars real-life daughter-father Miley and Billy Ray Cyrus, and, as a running joke, makes liberal fun of Billy Ray's past career as a mullet-topped country singer. Remember ""Achy Breaky Heart""?

Despite its ""Pop Star Profile"" subtitle, this DVD is not a profile of either Miley Cyrus or her Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana character. Instead, it's all about boyfriends. Specifically, the disc contains the four episodes from the show's first season (from way back in 2006, when its characters were in 8th grade) that focus on Miley's budding relationship with Jake Ryan, a new kid in school who's also a famous television star and soon the girl's first crush. The episodes piece together into one storyline, so if you watch them with the ""Play All"" feature they become, in essence, a 90-minute movie.

Besides the fact that these four episodes are some of the funniest in the series, what I liked best about them is how they portray a middle-school girl. Miley is smitten by Jake and not afraid to flirt with him, but always thinks for herself and never dresses like a street tart. Though as light as cotton candy, the programs are also thoughtful and well grounded.

By the way, Miley's Hannah Montana alter ego only appears once in these shows, in a brief scene where she's made up as a zombie.

The disc has two short bonus features. A five-minute featurette, ""The Real Miley Cyrus"" offers backstage insight from the actress, her parents and supporting cast. There's also a three-minute concert clip of Hannah Montana singing ""Nobody's Perfect,"" a catchy pop anthem that has become a top hit. It shows the cute 14-year-old bouncing around the stage dressed in (you go, Billy Ray) a fully-buttoned jacket and long pants.",1183075200,11,2104,4.8171745152354575

8185599,1,B000OLGCFC,"That's So Raven is way better than Hannah Montana.
I mean, Raven actually is hilarious, is a great actress, and can sing.
Miley Cyrus, on the other hand, can't act that good. She is an OK singer, she can only sing Rockish Alternative Pop music because her voice is so raspy.

Hannah Montana copies off of That's So Raven in these ways:

1. About a pop star, who keeps it a secret from everyone, but her family knows she is Hannah Montana. (Raven is psychic, only her family and friends know. It's a secret from everyone else.)

And, that's the biggest CLUE, that Hannah Montana is copying straight off of That's So Raven. Which is still Disney Channel's only show to have 100 episodes.
Plus, Hannah Montana's viewers have gone down to 2 million every new episode.
It music suck, because That's So Raven drew in over 3 million viewers every episode, and gets 1.8 million viewers on ABC Kids on Saturday Morning.
