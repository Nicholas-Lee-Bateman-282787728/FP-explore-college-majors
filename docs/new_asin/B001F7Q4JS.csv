3565656,5,B001F7Q4JS,As always Law & Order is complelling viewing. It gives a great insight in to the follow up of crimes. In particular in gives an insight into the DA's office and we learn that law does not always equal justice. Excellent acting from Sam Waterston. Roll on the next seires.,1231459200,,271,4.44
3565657,5,B001F7Q4JS,"Although I love all the Law and Order seasons, especially after McCoy is Assistant DA, I think this is the season that has the best of the episodes; the ones that I recall as being so good when first televised. My favorites are ""Girlfriends"" (this daughter one could do without!), ""Trophy"" (puts McCoy up on ethical charges when a former girlfriend/ADA did no-no's on his behalf and was going to let him take the fall), ""Humiliation"" (YOU CAN'T KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS!), and ""Encore"" (where a murderer who got off in an earlier episode commits another muder and is finally caught).
Every episode with Lenny Briscoe is memorable and the show hasn't been the same since he passed but I think Law and Order: The Sixth Year is probably the best of the best. I highly recommend!!",1231200000,,773,4.608695652173913
3565658,4,B001F7Q4JS,"Law & order is US longest ongoing crime-series. it's been there for so long time that it has become an institution. Here in Sweden we didn't get until the cable-TV had it's breakthrough in the 90's. And since then I have been fascinated by this great series.
The sixth year is one of the best vintages in my opinion. Jerry Orbach is the center of the series as the wise-cracking NY-copper Briscoe and his partner Rey Curtis (Benjamin Bratt). The DA-office McCoy and the cool Jill Hennessy as ADA Kincaid makes this sixth year really tick,
For a non-american it is very interseting to see how the juricidal system works in the uS.
greaat acting, good stories and av very great vintage of Law & Order",1231200000,,698,4.5476190476190474
3565659,5,B001F7Q4JS,"We love Law and Order.  We don't care for the spin-offs but are true blue to the original.  We hate that so many cast members have come and gone. We miss Jerry very much -may he rest in peace.  The characters of Abby, Serena were the best females on the series.  We miss Benjamin Brat and Jesse Green and they can never be replaced.  Haven't cared at all for the other detectives.  We're glad that ""Arthur"" is gone.  We always believed that Jack McCoy should be the DA but he really needs to be in the court room.  With the detectives they have now, less of Jack and the ADA's we may not be such huge fans now. That's why we love these series.  We just wish they would put more of them on disc.  We would buy them!",1228608000,,714,4.071942446043166
3565660,5,B001F7Q4JS,"It seems to take NBCUniversal quite a while to distribute the ""good stuff"" and the season six DVD is just that ... good stuff!

This was an action packed season coming off the heels of the best season ever for Law & Order. We are introduced to the ""let's do it by the books and utitilize some technology while we are at"" Rey Curtis played by Benjamin Bratt. His character is completely different from our beloved ""Mikey"" played so effectively by Chris Noth. The worst thing about season six is the departure of Jill Hennessy's character, ADA Claire Kincaid. I still skip the ending of her last Law & Order episode, After Shock. It is by far the worst ending Dick Wolf sanctioned for this show. He never should have killed off Claire. Of course, if he wants to get creative, I would love for Claire to return during this season from the Witness Protection Program. Jill are you busy (smile)? Jill has been the best female ADA on the series and her chemistry with Sam Waterson hits full stride during season six. They both rock!!

Bottom line: Grab this DVD as soon as it hits the market. You will not be disappointed. If you are a Law & Order junkie like me, you're just glad that NBCU finally has it ready. I just wish they would hurry and get all the seasons ready for distribution. Why the wait????

Peace",1226275200,7,1307,4.4375
3565661,5,B001F7Q4JS,"Season 6 of Law & Order begins with another cast change - Chris Noth is no longer present as Detective Mike Logan. As you may recall, in the 5th season finale, he punched out a city councilman who got away with murder and was mocking the outraged crowds. But Logan's action got him 'exiled' to Staten Island.

Benjamin Bratt takes his place as Detective Reynaldo 'Rey' Curtis. Curtis was a good cop, in need of some seasoning though, but on a personal note, I found him too parochially minded at times. The season ends with the surprising death of a main character, but to keep things interesting, I'm not listing the character here.

The 6th season of Law & Order continues the series tradition of addressing current social issues such as hate crimes, drugs, rape, racism, and various other crimes. This season also features the first crossover episode between Law & Order and Homicide: Life on the Street. Whether the episode from the second series is included in this set, I do not possess that information.

Of course, the cast delivers excellent performances as always, from the wise-cracking Lennie Briscoe, played by the late, much-lamented Jerry Orbach, to the passionately driven Jack McCoy played by Sam Waterston, as he relentlessly pursues justice in the cases he receives.

Now, Universal, get the rest of the seasons out!!!",1222819200,31,1337,4.902654867256637

Van Buren is great.  Her character is maternal in nature, but she balances her duties well as she keeps her detectives focused.  Briscoe is classic, albeit a little cynical.  He plays a nice counter to Curtis, as they strive to solve the crime.",1419379200,4,404,4.465753424657534

3565714,5,B001F7Q4JS,"I love the Law & Order Franchise, my personal favorite being SVU.  This selection of stories has two of my favorite combinations: Benjamin Bratt with Jerry Orbach , Jill Hennessy with Sam Waterston.  The difference between SVU and the original Law & Order is whereas SVU is primarily focused on character development L&O subjugates characterization to the plot.  It works for both.  This is a great collection, always filled with topical headlines of the day thinly adapted to L&O episodes.  The interaction between principals as the story unfolds adds to the story line.  My only gripe is occasionally liberal propaganda infiltrates the episodes.  Hey, Dick Wolf, keep your views to yourself and just tell a story.  All in all, though, a recommended addition to anyone's home library.",1407110400,,785,5.125984251968504

3565728,5,B001F7Q4JS,"Although I miss Chris Noth as the hot-headed Det. Mike Logan, Benjamin Bratt brings a whole new character to Det. Reynaldo ""Rey"" Curtis. He's more religious than the other detectives on the show and more devoted to family. His family problems are developed in later seasons; in this one, it's enough to see that he's a husband and father first and foremost. I was very sorry to see the last of Jill Hennessy as ADA Claire Kincaid, though, as she seemed more of a sincere, ethical lawyer than a pretty sidebar to the EADA, Sam Waterston. The two have a couple of scenes that are extremely subtle but offer just enough clues to make it reasonable to backtrack when, in later seasons, it's made clear that they had an affair. No hand-holding, nothing explicit, just a couple of scenes when they're seated a bit too comfortably next to each other on a couch, that kind of thing. And in the last, shocking episode, when Jack McCoy phones her at night to drive him home because he's been drinking, the implication is that they're closer than one might expect. The episodes are terrific, as always. A riff on the Kitty Genovese murder that rocked New York City in the 1960s, with a nasty ending. A favorite bad guy brought back from a prior season - can they make a case at last? A home invasion that is not what it seems. The episodes from this season have been rerun so often I can practically quote from them, but still found it worth my money to purchase the set on DVD.

3565733,5,B001F7Q4JS,"During the investigation of the murder of a gay politician and after the subsequent prosecution, Detective Logan attacked the defendant who was acquitted on a mistrial. The defendant, another politician. After throwing that punch, Detective Logan was demoted and transferred out of the 27th. His replacement was one Detective Reynaldo Curtis. A great contrast from Mike Logan, who was an undevout Irish-Catholic womanizing chauvinist, Rey Curtis was was a Hispanic devout Catholic who had a wife and three daughters. Curtis always looked cool and calm on the surface, but his hidden rage came out during an interrogation (and sometimes even an arrest) with a burst of energy you like a Dragon Ball Z character. Also around this time, Governor George Pataki reinstated the death penalty in the state of New York. The first time the death penalty was mentioned on the show was during an investigation and prosecution of a cop killer. Opinions spread like butter on toast. Unlike Mike and Lennie who always seem to agree or at at least accept each others points of view, everyone at one point or another seem to conflict. The conflict between Van Buren and Curtis is probably my favorite in this season. The new kid and the boss. For the most part Claire and Jack seem to agree more often, but not when it comes to the death penalty. Another reason to get this season is because it has the first episode that crosses with Homicide: Life on The Streets, a show about a homicide unit in the Baltimore Police department based on David Simon's bestselling non-fiction book. Also we see Detective John Munch for the first time making an appearance on Law & Order before his SVU days. Also included is the Homicide episode that concludes the story from the Law & Order episode. By the time you get to the last scene in the last episode, you will be convinced that you had your money's worth by buying this season. Another great year for the ever hard-hitting series. Benjamin Bratt's first season and Jill Hennessy's last. As Don Henley once said, ""In a New York Minute, everything could change."" And that's what is what made Law & Order a great series. It was always changing.",1361145600,,2168,4.784

This being the last season for Jill Hennessey playing Assistant ADA Claire Kincaid, definitely makes you appreciate her character...she portayed it very VERY well...her chemistry with ADA Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston), is practically unmatched...maybe Seasons 8 and 9 with Briscoe and Curtis, or seasons 11 and 12 with Briscoe and Green...but other than that, these two really worked well together and were an amazing pairing...you really feel like they work for the District Attorneys office...and you never really find out if they are actually sleeping together, but you kind of sense that they are...given McCoy's ""history"" with prior female 2nd chair ADA's...it is heartbreaking to see how Claire Kincaid bites the dust in the season finale, but fortunately Carie Lowells portrayal of Jamie Ross was good enough of a replacement in Seasons 7 and 8...

Also, we are introcuded to Briscoe's new partner, Detective Ray Curtis, as Det Mike Logan gets transfered to Staten Island as punishment for his temper getting the best of him in the Season 5 finale...they get off to a rocky start, but after a handful of episodes they are pals and start to develop some chemistry...which they perfect a couple seasons later...it's great to get a fresh face in the department after 5 years of Mike Logan...no knock on him, but it was definitely time for him to bow out and for someone new, and a bit more in contrast personality-wise and appearance-wise than Briscoe, to join the team...Logan was a bit too similar to Briscoe that the pairing got tiresome after a while...Logan works better with a femaie partner which we later see on Criminal Intent...and Briscoe, well he works great with anyone, but he was way more entertaining being paired with Curtis, and later with Det Green...

So kudos to the addition of Det Ray Curtis, who shined for 4 wonderful seasons, beginning here in season 6...and a thank you to Det Mike Logan, for 5 solid seasons and helping get this show on the map...for the first time ever, we get a peak into the personal lives of most of the characters...in the first 5 seasons I can barely recall knowing anything about the private lives of anyone on this show...finally we get to know a thing or two...and that definitely helps the audience relate to the characters and embrace them as such.

On a side note, in my personal opinion this was the beginning of about a ten year run of this show setting the bar super high for future detective/lawyer shows...Seasons 6-15 were arguably the best of the 20 seasons...and this is where that all started, in a sense...the recipe was developed right here.

Highly Recommended, 100% guaranteed!",1308441600,5,2939,4.905432595573441

3565750,4,B001F7Q4JS,"This is when this series REALLY started to become more than just a good series. The free flow dialog and apparent ad-libbing in that dialog makes these episodes feel far less choreographed. Few series have ever been able to make such a boast.

Benjamin Bratt joined the cast in this particular season. He was certainly a very good replacement for Chris Noth. On reflection however, I believe that a few actors could have played such a role. I'm almost sorry they weren't able to get someone like Ben Cross for such a role.

The episodes, as always are first rate, always asking questions of us viewers, giving us new questions to consider: When should the law and its application be a black and white issue, and what should the exceptions be? This is exactly why each case is decided on its own merits or lack thereof. I've always believed that most juries presume guilt and not innocence, and these episodes give me little to dispell that idea.

The cases in this season are generally dry issues, though there are some exceptions. The dialog is what makes the season to me, so much so that the usual extras that are missing don't feel missed by me. I am glad that they included the crossover episode of Homicide: Life On The Streets. I believe that was NEEDED to make the L&O episode complete.

I already can't wait for the seventh season.",1235260800,,1340,4.594142259414226
3565751,5,B001F7Q4JS,"I'm a big Law & Order fan, so I was very disappointed to find that the only seasons available for purchase were 1, 2, 5, and 14 (I think), as well as the most recent ones - until now. One of the most groundbreaking seasons, Season Six introduces Benjamin Bratt as Reynaldo Curtis, a very dynamic character who is proud of his heritage and doesn't react well to insults about it, as is shown several times throughout the season. It deals with current events, albeit from over ten years ago, and admittedly some of the references I did not understand. But this did not detract from the action and drama that are characteristic of the series. What did was the bonus episode from Homicide: Life on the Street. The camerawork, acting, and writing from H:LotS were all sub-par in my opinion, but since it's only one episode and it's from a different series, I did not fault Law & Order for it. All in all, this one of the best seasons of Law and Order, probably the best one available for purchase, and my only regret is that it ended too soon.",1234051200,,1038,4.411458333333333
