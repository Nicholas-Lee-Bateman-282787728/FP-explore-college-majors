8651530,5,B00JJRLFQ8,"American coach, Bob Bradley is hired by the Egyptian soccer team to coach them into qualifying for the World Cup after more than 20 years of failure.  Coach Bradley and his lovely wife move to Cairo for a little more than a year, to shape and prepare the team for a victory.  As in Europe, African's including Egyptians take soccer very seriously, more so than American's do with football.  In many ways, those seeking a political voice have used the stadium audience as a forum for protest of the military regime during this time.
As a result, the documentary explores the various factions (on a superficial level) and their frustrations at not being able to be free to give voice to their discord.

I think this documentary presents the teams desire to supersede the politics of the country with hopes of unifying the country with their accomplishments. We observe key moments during their qualifying games among the African nations.  While I'm not a big soccer fan, I found this documentary riveting.  Coach Bradley and his wife were great ambassadors to the Egyptian nation and their respect for the country, customs and players resonates throughout his tenure with the team.

I highly recommend this to those who may not typically watch a sports documentary.  Its presentation of motivation, perseverance and teamwork are all messages anyone can learn more about.",1416960000,,1368,4.969298245614035
