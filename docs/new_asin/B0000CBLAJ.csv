7998627,4,B0000CBLAJ,"For Improvers to Intermediates to initial advanced.
With Roberto Quintero and company.
Very good but with with some very wooden commentary.
Good on Tuning (Tumbadora: Sol-'G'; Quinto: Me-'E' and Conga: La-'A' - ? errata in the DVD)  - note Potato Valdez used AGC-(LaSolDo).
Shows Masacote (Tumbao-1 Drum, Mambo-2 Drum and Masacote-3 Drum), basic variations in 2-3 versus 3-2 Clave.
Caballo, Songo (incl Timbales), Salsa Moderna, Rumba (Yambu and Colombia - i.e. Matanzas, but no Guaganco or Tonada Trinitaria) Bembe, Latin Jazz and Soloing. A shame no Cyclo Congo (Makuta, Palo & Yuka) is included.

It is missing sheet music and continuous play loop for each pattern, If it had the sheet music and repeat loop it would have got a 5*.
Excellent well worth the money.",1144627200,2,766,5.071428571428571
