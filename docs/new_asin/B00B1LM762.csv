5551809,5,B00B1LM762,"Anyone who thinks that this DVD, ""Extreme Dinosaurs"", isn't good has got to be crazy.  Sure, it doesn't have as much CGI graphics as others, but this one is more intellectual than the others, as it tells the scientific story behind the dinosaurs.  In the first episode, the potential pack-hunting of Giganotosaurus is explored.  Even more fascinating is the second episode, which describes the prevailing thoughts about T. rex and how they might be wrong.  One paleontologist thinks that T. rex was mostly a scavenger, while another one thinks he was a predator.  It is interesting to hear the various evidence and to then draw your own conclusions.  The T. rex episode is one of the best I've ever seen about this particular dinosaur.

If you want flashy graphics without much substance, watch Jurassic Park.  If you want to learn something about the dinosaurs that is scientific and based upon evidence, watch this DVD (and the others in the BBC series).  It's your choice!",1381881600,12,975,4.896341463414634
5551810,4,B00B1LM762,"There are many dinosaur documentaries. This one is a new release and so it features the newest theories on the dinosaurs lifestyle. Animation is excellent and language is easily understood so novice viewers will not get lost. If you like the Walking with Dinosaur series, you will  like this as well if not better.",1379462400,2,314,4.814814814814815
5551811,3,B00B1LM762,"It is just a bunch of one's I have already seen on one DVD.  And one guy that I can't stand, he comes on and talks about the same thing they just explained, and they do a better job, I can't stand his voice!!!!
 If I had known I would never of bought it, Live and learn, buyer be weir.
 If I had never of seen it on TV, it might of been ok except for that one guy.",1379289600,,364,3.5822784810126582
5551812,4,B00B1LM762,"""Extreme Dinosaurs"" is an interesting BBC documentary about palaeontologists who through pain-staking detective work try to solve some mysteries surrounding Argentinosaurus and Giganotosaurus, two virtual monsters unearthed in Patagonia.

Frankly, it's almost unbelievable that a creature the size of Argentinosaurus could even have existed! The riddle scientists want to solve is whether this huge animal (a peaceful herbivore) had any natural enemies. The carnivorous Giganotosaurus (which was the size of a T-Rex) was nevertheless too small to take on a fully grown Argentinosaurus. One possibility is that Giganotosaurus was a pack hunter, but this is a controversial idea. Tyrannosaurus and similar dinosaurs are generally thought of as solitary animals.

The scientists featured in the documentary believe they have found tantalizing evidence that overturns the standard view. The fossilized remains of what might be a Tyrannosaurus pack have been unearthed in a remote region of Canada. More to the point, a newly discovered unnamed relative of Giganotosaurus in Patagonia might have lived in packs, too. Thus, a true ""battle of the titans"" between the super-sized Argentinosaurus and packs of marauding carnosaurs might actually have taken place... It seems even dinos need a dino-burger from time to time!

I admit that I really don't care whether or not Argentino and Giganoto fought the battle of the millennium, but some people seem childishly fascinated by such a prospect. Too much video games? I was more intrigued by the amount of research (and good luck) that went into this project. One of the palaeontologists managed to find the sensational Canadian site with the help of a century-old photo in National Geographic. Sherlock Holmes would have been impressed.

Overall, I think this was a relatively good documentary, so I give it four stars.",1375833600,6,1861,5.451388888888889
5551813,5,B00B1LM762,"Like ""Predator Dinosaurs,"" this DVD (i.e., Extreme Dinosaurs) is educational and interesting. Paleontologist Dr. Phillip Currie is shown at actual T-rex (Canadian) and South American sites in search of evidence that the tyrannosaurs and similar large predatory dinosaurs were social and lived in groups.  This DVD does not have the CGI that ""Predator Dinosaurs"" or ""Planet Dinosaur"" have but, nevertheless, it is a very interesting and educational film, showing decent fossils in actual locations... some of them being of the largest predatory and non-predatory dinosaurs known so far. Personally, I think that with T-rex, especially, the younger T-rexes were much more agile, nimble, and predatory.  The adults were sometimes predatory too, but mostly would often just use olfactory supremacy to smell, locate, and go to the kill of other dinosaurs (and then dominatingly take it away from them). When you are big, ferocious, and bulky -- with the nose/smell equivalent of 100 bloodhounds combined -- it's easier just to go and take another's kill than to chase after your own.",1366588800,2,1078,5.3352941176470585

8560879,2,B00B1LM762,"This is just boring. Generally speaking, it's just re-hashed and re-colored visuals from Walking With Dinosaurs that go with paleontologists bickering about different dinosaurs. It's extreme in only one way; how boring it is. My advice is to stay away from this DVD and get Predatory Dinosaurs and/or Planet Dinosaur from BBC.

Or hell, just go watch Walking With Dinosaurs again.",1429574400,,380,5.229508196721311
