5410053,5,B00ADUSJP0,"Leading Between the Vines, by the incomparable Terry Theise (who also wrote the book ""Reading Between the Wines""), is a love letter from him to us about German Riesling and people who produce it. As he interviews these incredibly talented yet humble growers, Terry gently questions them about their land, their vineyards, their backgrounds, and most importantly, their deep love of what they do. As we watch and listen, not only do we discover what is so special about this magnificent wine, we are also given an intimate glimpse into the hearts and souls of the families who produce them.

Visually, it is a stunningly beautiful film that includes views of sweeping vistas of the vineyards in the Nahe, Mosel, and Rhinehessen regions.

If you have any interest in wine in general, this movie will teach you exactly what you need to know.",1357862400,,838,4.853146853146853
5410054,5,B00ADUSJP0,"Terry has been making the case for the these wines for decades, and now he lets the producers speak for themselves in simple and convincing terms.  The photography is quite beautiful, as these vineyards really are something to see. Though some may find the film a bit precious, wines like these are so much more than just commodities.  This would be a great little add on gift for any wine lover.",1356652800,,396,4.563380281690141
5410055,5,B00ADUSJP0,"Really enjoying this film, looking forward to watching again, and to sharing it with my friends. If you are at all interested in wine, you will love this movie. Getting to see my favorite wine growers in their element, passionately and lucidly speaking about their land, history and culture is a treat. Like taking a whirlwind wine tour without leaving your living room! Be sure to have pop a few bottles of Riesling for viewing, best with a few friends, to flesh out your regional offerings.

Great job!",1356480000,2,504,4.7272727272727275
8550268,3,B00ADUSJP0,"You want this to be good.  I am a pretty hard core old world wine guy.  The good: visually beautiful.  The not so good: It just never finds its focus and meanders around trying to figure out terroir.  You just want it to succeed but it under performs.  Would not have bought it had I seen it before hand.  Three stars means ""OK.""",1459296000,2,329,4.142857142857143
8550269,4,B00ADUSJP0,Very interesting!,1447718400,,17,8.0
8550270,2,B00ADUSJP0,It was OK but thought I would have gotten a deeper understanding of grapes and their growers.,1446940800,,93,4.529411764705882
8550271,5,B00ADUSJP0,"It would be tempting to wax superfluous about this movie in light of what is captured. I would rather share some simple insights.

Roots. The film is about roots, history, heritage. As deep as the roots of a slender vine must penetrate in the crumbling slate of a Nahe vineyard, so too must the history of the land be met with an appreciation of the heritage and culture of humility in wine-making. Depth of person in service of the depth of tradition and ecological wonder.

Let us not kid ourselves, Terry Theise has not completely unlocked the mysteries of what makes truly exceptional wine, that remains a mystery to even the most seasoned.

What he has done with this film is share a fleeting glimpse of the wonder and awe that truly penetrates when a person serves, rather than dominates, the land. Great wine is produced, it would seem, through labor, duress and humility in the face of hardship, where the reward may only be found in like minded communities and not financial ones. It is tough, foreign to most of the modern world, but rewarding like Pascal's promise of infinite reward rather than immediate satisfaction.

It is difficult even to review such a film as this, as it begs us to fall silent and consider its message instead. Whenever we are opportune to privately glance inward we are prone to judge. A fussy child often begs the disdain of the childless. We are offered the time to entreat upon a moment in this film, one whose timeline stretches many generations forward and back and consider its implications not just in a vineyard, a wine bottle's contents, or the success of a region, but to consider where it places us in our own terroir.

Our own terroir is not always found in a vineyard, but in a place and time where we have placed our own roots. Where we seek to penetrate layer upon layer of soil in the name of the past to protect and embrace with love, the future. Terry Theise has found this aspect of life in and amongst the vines. The question that remains for the audience is not to find it amongst vines, but to find the context and character coincidence that produces the same in themselves.",1408665600,,2133,4.5732984293193715
8550272,5,B00ADUSJP0,"Terry Theise has created, directed and narrated this most beautiful movie about artisanal wine growers/producers!!  Set in the Mosel, Nahe and Rhine valleys of Germany, this movie carries you away and shows you a culture that continues to exist in the Old World through these wine producing families.  Generations have figured out the terroir and it is well demonstrated in the film.  Stunning cinematography on what has to be one of the most beautiful wine producing regions of the world.  Gently and insightfully narrated, beautiful music as well.  I agree with previous reviewers that one should read Terry's book ""Reading Between the Wines""  first, then watch the film.  Then read Terry's book again and put a face to the families and places discussed in the book.  His book is pure poetry, it will change not only how you think about wine, but also how you think about life.  I did not think it was possible for him to do as good a job in film, but he has.  The movie is captivating.  Thank you Terry for sharing what has become such a big part of  your life with all of us We are better for it.",1407024000,2,1100,4.5561224489795915
8550273,5,B00ADUSJP0,"Simply beautiful. I wish I could thank Terry Theise personally for making the film. It is authentic, beautiful, and heart warming. The best wine film made to date, IMHO.",1393545600,,169,4.862068965517241
8550274,5,B00ADUSJP0,"This is a lovely film by Terry Theise in follow-up to his book, Reading between the Wines. I would strongly recommend reading the book first in order to gain a better understanding of Terry's strong ties to the wine, the people and the countryside of this very special area in Germany where it all comes together. If you have an affinity for wine, you will have a great appreciation for how Terry is able to put into words the wonder of wine and the people who work with nature to bottle such a beautiful, living thing for the pleasure of so many. You will laugh, you will cry and you will be in awe at your own greater understanding by the end.

Then enjoy the film, as author and director Terry Theise takes you there to see it for yourself ... the lush, green hillsides and valleys, the vines at home in their natural terroir, the soil, slate and clay ... the beauty of it all. Listen, too, as the individual winemakers tell their own stories of how and why they do what they do, in hand with nature, along with the histories of their families and their wine estates, what the future may hold and more.

Read the book, watch the film and enjoy a glass or two of your favorite wine along the way!",1372896000,4,1198,4.29646017699115
8550275,5,B00ADUSJP0,A must see for wine lovers.  Especially those that appreciate the great wines of Germany and an iconic wine importer.,1361923200,,117,4.85
8550276,5,B00ADUSJP0,"Anyone who truly appreciates the journey a wine makes from the field to the table should see this movie.  Terry Theise provides a clear, poetic voice for these producers, their lives and aspirations, and the land they work.  I would also suggest his book, ""Reading Between the Wines"" as a companion to this DVD.  I laughed and cried through the whole book, finding a new appreciation  for just about everything in life.",1360281600,,419,4.777777777777778
8550277,5,B00ADUSJP0,"""Wine grower""  is what the wine producers in this film call themselves.  They don't just grow grapes. They don't just produce wine. They ""grow"" wine with their hard work, passion and generations of experience.  If you love wine... if you like wine.... if you have the slightest interest in any kind of wine,  you will love this film.  It's about family, culture, history, geology, legacy, beauty and the ""connection"" of all of those things to the experience of drinking artisanal wines.  Stunningly filmed and passionately edited and narrated, it's a homage to one of the most unique wine regions in the world and some of the families that grow the distinctive and beautiful wines that come from it.

I was pleasantly surprised to see so many young growers featured in the film. While most of them stood alongside the fathers who effectively cultivated their dedication, it was clear this worldly younger generation is eager and able to make their own mark. When you're done watching, you will be convinced of the importance of terroir in the profile of any wine and more specifically you will fully understand the minerality and slate underpinnings of Mosel and Nahe Riesling. You will also have a whole new appreciation of what goes into producing a bottle of wine (particularly one born from a steep mountainside vineyard), and the tremendous value often inherent in wines from lesser known regions.

When you're done watching you will share Terry Theise's potent connection to the Mosel, its growers and its wines.  ""If I didn't live here, I'd want to vacation here"" says Johannes Selbach in one of the DVD's many extras.  That's exactly what I plan to do (along with drinking more great Riesling!) after watching this inspiring film.",1358035200,7,1738,4.941580756013746
