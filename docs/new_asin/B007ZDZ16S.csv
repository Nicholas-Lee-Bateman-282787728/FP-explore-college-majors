8523390,5,B007ZDZ16S,This set surprised me and it was very enjoyable to see all of the children of famous country legends. The country family reunion dvd's are wonderful to watch especially for those that enjoy classic country. If you are looking for solid music this set is not for you. There are some wonderful performances but there are a lot of stories about the iconic country legends.,1522540800,,369,4.6923076923076925

8523393,3,B007ZDZ16S,"When I made order, Amazon product description/photo showed CFR Second Generations as 5 DVD discs including the main program (4 DVD discs) and separately boxed  ""Backstage"" 1DVD disc.  I only received main program (4 DVD discs) without Backstage. I am very dissapointed, as I wanted & paid for the complete 5DVD disc program. Amazon advised ""Inventory"" problem & now cannot supply ""Backstage"" 1DVD disc.  Amazon have now altered product description to show 4DVD's (main program only), without ""Backstage"" DVD. at same full price US$79.80.  This is occurring whenever the CFR set of 5DVD discs product including the separately boxed ""Backstage"" 1DVD is ordered.  Very disappointing. Refer attached photo.",1457827200,,702,5.462962962962963

8523396,5,B007ZDZ16S,"I usually buy these straight from the manufacturer, but unfortunately I was not able to do that at the time this video was initially released.  It is an informal gathering of primarily the children of some of traditional country music's greatest stars. Some of the attendees include Christie Woolley, Ronny Robbins, Michael Twitty, Georgette Jones, Charlie Rich Jr, Dean Smith, Dean Miller, Phil Campbell, Karen Wheeler, Robyn Young, Deborah Luman, Donnie and Harold Hawkins, Wil and Langdon Reid, Jett Williams, George Hamilton V, and Shelly West.  Some of the Country's Family Reunion regulars also appear, including Jan Howard, Jean Shepard, Jim Ed Brown, George Hamilton IV, Bill Mack, and Bill Anderson, who acts as the moderator. It is amazing (and, at times, a little frightening) how much some of these individuals sound like their legendary parents.  I highly recommend this collection.",1377993600,4,895,5.333333333333333
