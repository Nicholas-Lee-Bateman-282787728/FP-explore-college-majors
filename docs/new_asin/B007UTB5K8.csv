'Found footage' films...isn't anyone getting sick and tired of seeing them yet? Yes. Yes, we are. Take note film makers. It's old. It's tired. It's been done to DEATH, if you'll pardon the pun.

I can sum up the entire movie thusly: Stupid, irritating crew shows up on site and is locked in. ""What was that, did you hear that?"" someone yells. Someone gets killed. Everybody runs amok screaming the ""F"" word. ""What was that??"" someone else yells. Someone else gets killed. Cameraman switches to infrared vision. Everybody runs amok screaming the ""F"" word. Someone else gets killed. Ghost rape. Everybody runs amok screaming the ""F"" word. They turn on each other. Someone else gets killed. ""Oh my God...there's NO WAY OUT OF HERE!"" someone screams, conveniently forgetting that they ASKED to be locked in. Someone else gets killed, and everybody runs amok yet again, screaming the ""F"" word. No one makes it out alive, and we never get to see but about a one second shot of the 'bad guy'. The end. SNORE!",1407888000,,1021,4.795454545454546
5110597,2,B007UTB5K8,"Just from the title alone and reading the synopsis of this film, I knew it had very little chance of being good. First off, I'm a fan of true crime and know the story of Richard Speck. And why in the world would filmmakers choose to turn a story of a real mass murderer into a fake ghost story is beyond me. But even with that being said, if you are going to go that route, at least get your facts straight! Yes, I know this is a work of fiction, but you are basing at least part of your movie on REAL events and people. And though there are too many inaccuracies to mention, the two biggest ones are the number of victims and the location of the killings. Richard Speck killed EIGHT people in a dormitory/townhouse for nurses. The movie repeatedly says seven victims..which makes me cringe. How can you attempt to make a film and not get the most basic information correct? And though the address they mention is right. It wasn't some apartment building/asylum like the one shown. Again, yes, this is fiction, but why not at least attempt to find a location similar to the real place? This film has so little to do with the actual Richard Speck that I don't even understand why they would try to somehow associate it with the crimes. Was it to get more attention to the film? Whatever the case, the filmmakers would have been much better off fictionalizing everything and coming up with an original idea.  As far as the film itself, the acting is pretty much crap, the script is crap, characters are very forgettable, and the effects, at least that of the ""ghost"" of Richard Speck is almost laughable. The one 'rape' scene looked flat out silly. There's also a complete rip off of The Blair Witch Project, with the ""standing in the corner"" shot. But even with all that being said, in all honestly, this isn't THAT bad of a film. I wasn't expecting anything great here. Good found footage films are few and far between. But what hurt this film the most for me was all the misinformation and quite honesty, the silliness of the idea of a Richard Speck ""ghost story"".",1394150400,,2065,4.4485488126649075
5110598,4,B007UTB5K8,"I've been trying to remember how this DVD ended up in my collection, and try as I might, I just can't.  I'd be willing to bet it was a used DVD from Hastings and it probably didn't cost more than $3 or $4.  In that case, I definitely got my money's worth.

100 GHOST STREET: The Return of Richard Speck is another found footage movie from The Asylum, makers of fine cheese for over 15 years now.  This movie is also known as PARANORMAL ENTITY 4, which, if I had known that when I bought it, I'd have grabbed it even quicker.  I loved the first two PEs, PARANORMAL ENTITY and GACY HOUSE (I haven't seen the third one, ANNELIESE: The Exorcist Tapes, but from what I hear it's pretty bad.  I don't care, I want to see it anyway), and this movie follows pretty much the same formula as the second one: a team of investigators goes into the medical dormitory where Richard Speck carried out his murder spree and try to contact his ghost, in the end getting much more than they bargained for and their bodies were never seen again.  Five days later the footage was found and is just now being released to the public.  Blah blah blah.

We've heard it all before.

But it still works, so why mess with it, right?

And yes, it does still work.  100 GHOST STREET is every bit as creepy as GACY HOUSE was and it works because the folks at The Asylum know one very critical ingredient to the found footage formula, and that is point of view.  The PARANORMAL ACTICITY movies are good, I own all of them so far.  But for the most part, they rely on a stationary camera being set up to record the events as they happen in the house to the family.  These PARANORMAL ENTITY movies, however, put the viewer directly into the POV of the characters as they navigate the location, usually in the dark with only a single spotlight from the camera, sometimes in a crawlspace or basement and even in the scenes where nothing happens, the tension is high with expectation and possibility.

The effects are minimal, the outcome predictable, but under the right conditions, these movies work.  For me, the right conditions are watching at 5:00 AM, while it's still dark outside, watching on my laptop with my headphones.  I prefer watching on the computer for these movies as opposed to the television, because it puts me ""closer"" to the action, I'm only a foot or two from the screen instead of across the room, and in a dark room, with the soundtrack playing directly into my ears, it's just plain old fashioned creepy.  And I dig it.

The acting is mediocre and I didn't care about any of the characters and the ""director"" of the project had that stupid swept-forward haircut I despise so I was actually happy to see him get dragged into the dark.  Also, I think this movie holds a record by having the black guy die only a minute and a half in.  100 GHOST STREET was written by Nancy Leopardi, but I wonder how much writing actually goes into these movies and how much is ad-libbed.  Martin Andersen directed and it's his only credit, so I wonder how much direction goes into these movies, too, at least as far as the acting goes, or does most of the directing deal strictly with making sure the doors slam shut when they're supposed to, etc.

Whatever it is, I don't care; I like it either way.  In fact, I'm ready for more of these movies.  There are a ton of serial killers out there just waiting to be the subtitle of the next Asylum PARANORMAL ENTITY sequel and when it happens, I'll be there.  None of this is to suggest these are quality movies; they're not.  They're cheaply made, the story is non-existent and the characters might as well not even have names for all they matter.  But in a world where an honest to God HORROR movie is as rare as an honest to God Bigfoot sighting, I'll take what chills I can get, and if that means I'm relegated to watching PE sequels in the dark over and over, then I guess that's what I have to do until someone out there with the talent to make a truly terrifying movie again comes along.  I'm not holding my breath, though, so in the meantime, I'm onboard for more PARANORMAL ENTITIES.",1361664000,2,4109,4.382585751978892
5110599,5,B007UTB5K8,"This is an excellent movie. But the format is not blu ray is DVD so the image is wrong.

I love horror movies and this one is one of my favorites.",1361491200,,146,3.7096774193548385
5110600,5,B007UTB5K8,"My husband and I watched this at home this week and it was sooo terrifying, brutallly gory, and very well executed.  The film footage and infrared scenes of the spectre of Richard Speck while he raped and killed his victims was amazingly done with computerized imaging.  If this is a spoof of ""real footage released by the families of the victims"" I don't know.  It seems very real.  Then I read about the real killings of the student nurses and that scared me even more.  Especially since I AM a nurse.  I don't know, you should rent this if you like scary movies.  It is disturbing and has all the gore, too.  And of course, a predictable ending but it would have been nice to see some survivors.",1345507200,,698,4.3984375
5110601,3,B007UTB5K8,"Well, I am a ""found footage"" junkie, and being so I have seen tons of terrible movies lately. This is by no means one of them. However, it isn't great either.  I am assuming that the director was working with a low budget, but it still looks pretty good. My biggest gripe with the movie was that they went the route of showing a white, blurry, translucent figure for the ghost. Just because you have a low budget does not mean you need to have a misty figure there for us. I don't know about all of you, but I would rather just see nothing. This allows me to use my imagination a little more, and makes it a little bit more frightening for me.  My second issue is the out of place nudity in the movie. Please don't get me wrong, I like breast as much as the next guy, but the nudity was just so out of place on this one.  If they had started the beginning of the movie with some nudity while we were getting to know the characters, then I would be game for that one.  However, this happens in the middle of their investigation, and it wasn't even for a love making/sex situation. The girl just takes her shirt off, and then the ghost attacks the guy closest to her.  The scene had me a little confused, because I didn't know if I was supposed to be aroused or scared. Maybe the director thinks those emotions are one in the same. I think that one scene really takes you out of the movie and reinforces the fact that it is low budget indie horror.

You may be wondering why I gave it the three star treatment, when I did  nothing but gripe about it above.  Well, the reason is the flaws come to mind first, and I figure lets get the gripes out of the way first, and end on a positive note.

The movie had parts of excellent tension, and really drew me into the dread that the characters were supposed to be feeling.  I thought over all the acting was pretty good for a group of people I have never seen before and most likely won't see again. The story wasn't anything to write home about, but it wasn't too lame  either.  I really enjoyed the fact that the movie didn't shy away from the gore. I know, I griped about seeing too much of the ghost, but the turn around and say that I enjoy seeing a lot of gore.  What can I say, I am an american!  It was just refreshing to see what happened to the characters versus seeing them dragged off and never being seen again.

In closing, if you have seen and enjoyed ""Grave Encounters"", then this would be a decent way to spend your next hour and twenty minutes.  If you hated ""Grave Encounters""....do I really need to finish that sentence?",1344556800,3,2582,4.185858585858586
5110602,1,B007UTB5K8,"In spite of the other positive reviews of this title, I have to warn anyone who is a TRUE crime fan or a follower of the Richard Speck case and story. This ""film"" is not true in any way shape or form. This is not a real documentary about real ghost hunters trying to make contact with the real ghost of Richard Speck. This ""film"" does NOT really do what it claims to do, nor does it provide any of the ""actual footage"" or documentation that it claims.  The makers of this video specialize in ""Blair Witch Project"" types of stories that are completely fictional and have no basis in truth. All of this is fine, but in this case, it is a very misguided and poorly executed attempt to piggy back off of the noteriety of a true story about a very heinous and gruesome mass murder.

First, the ""filmmakers"" claim that this was actual footage shot at the actual site on the far south side of Chicago where Richard Speck stabbed and strangled eight student nurses to death in July, 1966. This is so not true. Again, knowing that this is a fictional tale, it would be excusable if not for the fact that no attempt was made on the filmmaker's part to find a location that at least looks a little bit like the real place where the dastardly deed took place.  Not only is this not filmed at the actual site, they didn't even pick a location that comes anywhere near resembling the actual 3 bedroom townhouse where the actual slaughter occurred. Instead they picked, on their very low  budget, a huge, abandoned, multi-story apartment building, a location that does not bear any similarity whatsoever to the actual site and completely fails to capture the horror of the cramped quarters in which Speck so brutally and viciously murdered those woman so many years ago. It would be no different if someone made a movie about the Manson Family at Spahn Ranch, but shot it in a vacant lot in the Bronx, rather than in a more realistic location in L.A.

I won't go into the bad acting on the part of the young group of thespians who attempt to take a very poor script and make something of it. Nor will I waste your time describing the cliched handheld camera shots of dark corridors and water-damaged rooms and ""ooh this is where Speck murdered all those women"" comments from the actors. The story here is inconsequential. Suffice to say, it may be a decent story for 20 year olds who haven't seen all this before, but believe me, this is like ALL of the other ""paranormal"" ""haunted house"" reality-show type pop fiction you've seen time and time again on cable TV if you're over the age of 30.

The long and short of this is that this is a fictional horror movie in which a bunch of actors playing ghost-hunters go to a building to try and make contact with a ghost (in this case the ghost of Speck). True crime buffs will find no documentary or educational relevence in this item. Again, I don't have a problem with this, except for the fact that it is marketed as being true and real which is a misleading and cheap way to suck in true crime fans who are interest in the REAL story of Speck and his victims.",1343433600,7,3093,4.398601398601398
5110603,4,B007UTB5K8,"Watched this the other day, and I enjoyed it a lot.  No, it's not some $60,000,000 Hollywood movie, but that's not what it's trying to be.  As far as found footage movies go, it's solid.  Some of the deaths and scares could be tightened up a bit, but overall it presents a realistically creepy atmosphere and a solid story.

This movie would have made millions of dollars if it had been released before Paranormal Activity.  But, as it is, it's a solid found footage movie.

4 stars. Would watch again.",1343088000,4,502,4.522222222222222

8522034,1,B007UTB5K8,This movie should be outlawed.  Seriously.  I watched it on deployment and was actually hoping that we'd get some incoming action just to spice things up.  Whoever made this movie did a complete disservice to what could have been a cool premise.,1449532800,,245,4.785714285714286
8522035,3,B007UTB5K8,"There is nothing that really sticks out in this film as groundbreaking or original but it is a pretty good movie. The story is believable and comprehensible. The action begins almost immediately and convincingly. The special effects in this film is standard play in this subgenre and is done very well. There is plenty of gory death scenes and melodramatic acting from the cast. The scares are not so much instantaneous or shocking but the whole film is pretty entertaining.

It isn't an edge of your seat chills kind of movie but the film manages to keep you interested by showing a steady amount of action and drama. I actually found it to be a very enjoyable paranormal film that brought the blood and gore. The effects are not high end but they are better than a lot of the films in this subgenre of horror. If your looking for sudden chills or scare moments that make you jump then look elsewhere, but that aside it is a very good ghost story. The atmosphere is creepy, the location is dark and the story behind the paranormal activity is gruesome.",1433462400,,1053,4.571428571428571
