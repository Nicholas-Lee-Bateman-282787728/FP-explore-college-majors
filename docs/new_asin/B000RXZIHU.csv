2876260,3,B000RXZIHU,"After reading all the reviews, I was very excited to get this video.  I thought for sure in 90 minutes I would be challenged.  I wasn't.  I was barely sweating when I was done, and I've been doing this for years, so I know how to do the moves correctly and with intensity.  It was fun, so I may keep it as part of my collection for that reason.  But if you are an advanced exerciser, this is NOT the video for you.",1193961600,9,414,3.9397590361445785
2876261,3,B000RXZIHU,"I am an avid Taebo fan, but the intensity is lacking in this one. If you can fake smile and high-five each other during the routine then the workout is too easy. The ""dance"" section is cheesy. This workout is longer (90 mins compared to 55mins), but less intense. If you are looking for a difficult workout, I would HIGHLY recommend the Taebo Get Ripped:Advanced Series. There are (2) 55 min workouts and (1) 8 min workout.",1193356800,81,423,4.5064935064935066
2876262,5,B000RXZIHU,"This is classic tae bo.  No billy bands, no squat thrusts, no fatigues, no drills, no boot camp screaming.  Thank goodness! Just punching and tae bo combos.  The music is good and loud.  Billy is on his game this time. At the end, he gets a little funky and does dance moves.  So funny to watch the students try to get down.  Lots of fun. Get it. Do it.",1191888000,53,353,4.043478260869565
2876263,5,B000RXZIHU,"Ultimate Tae Bo is just that, ULTIMATE!!!!  From the beginning to the end it is fun, yet challenging.  Billy warms you up nicely, then jumps right into all the fun and favorite Tae Bo moves that help to sculpt and shape our bodies!  If you are looking for a way to step out, to challenge yourself, get the Ultimate Tae Bo.  You have the option of going one hour or an hour and a half.  Billy is fun, he keeps it exciting, and just like always, he keeps you coming back and wanting more!  Once I finished this workout I felt like I could climb Mt. Everest, I felt like if I could conquer this, then I can conquer anything!!  If you want to be a conqueror, then conquer Ultimate Tae Bo!!  I promise, you won't regret it!!!!",1191024000,7,721,4.173913043478261
2876264,5,B000RXZIHU,"You'll be sweating calories when you do this workout.  It's fantastic and effective and tough, but very worth it.  I've done this now four times and never think I'll make it through, but somehow do and even though it's early stages, I'm beginning to see the hint of results.
It's 90 minutes of almost non-stop combinations that Tae Bo are known for.  It's his longest workout to date (you can stop at a set 59 minute breakpoint) so you must already be fit.  There are all the regular Tae Bo moves like fast feet and quick steps etc so you should have a basic knowledge of his work to make it easier on yourself although he does cue very well.  Then after those combo's there is aerobic/toning intervals.
I'd never recommend this to someone who's just beginning to work out or to a Tae Bo newcomer.  However, if you are already fit and want a big challenge for yourself, then this is for you.  You'll be sweating hard and buring calories like crazy.  This is a great fun workout.",1189209600,111,978,4.424581005586592
2876275,4,B000RXZIHU,"Over the past few months I have committed to working out. In the past I have got bored with programs so I have looked for a lot of affordable sets to build a large and diverse collection. I find that eating better and changing the way I move my muscles has helped me lose about 40lbs already. I first did Tae Bo over 15 years ago, but I now that I have returned to them, I find that I still enjoy the workouts. Workouts with Kickboxing, MMA, and Dance are some of my favorites to do.  I wanted to find a longer workout for days in which I have the time as most of my workouts are in the 20-60 minute range. I was pleased with this workout. The 90 minute workout is now the longest workout that I have. He moves are typical with other Tae Bo sets that I have tried, but this one does include a brief Dance sequence that I almost laughed so hard that I lost my steps for a minute...lol. Billy's counting is off from time to time but it is still a great workout. I like that the 90 minute workout can actually be split into a 60 and 30 minute workout or done together. I also like that an additional bonus fat burner workout is included as well. This one disc provides an option of 2 to 3 workouts and is a great deal. I have sets from Tony Horton, Chalene Johnson, Shaun T, Beto Perez, Sagi Kalev and several other trainers to mix things up, but I will always keep Billy in the rotation.",1465344000,,1385,4.073260073260073

2876277,5,B000RXZIHU,"I have 5 Tae bo dvds and this is definitely my favorite workout. It's 89 minutes long; I usually only do 60 minute-ish work outs, but the fun dance breakdown in the middle gives me a second wind.  There's also a break at the 60 minute mark, which is a good place to stop if you want to. If you don't break a sweat during this work out,  you are not working hard enough...or not human.  Billy is super encouraging and time flies.  I love that there isn't a timer at the bottom of the screen.  They do count the whole time, but I'm used to it and the purpose of counting is to learn to control your breathing when you work out. It is truly helpful. I highly recommend, if you're a Tae Bo fan or not.",1462406400,3,697,4.021739130434782

2876311,5,B000RXZIHU,"I wasn't disappointed at all with this purchase.  I was looking for a longer, more challenging workout with Tae Bo and this delivered!  Some reviewers commented about the ""cheesy"" dance part, but honestly, it was funny and broke up the workout, especially before doing the extra 30 minutes!  I wouldn't do this every day, 90 minutes is too much time during the work week, but I will definitely be incorporating the hour long section (they take a break, where you can choose to continue or stop) and then doing the full 90 minutes once a week or so.  I'm a fitness fanatic and work out 6 days a week and found this workout challenging.  I started using  1 pound weighted gloves for more of a challenge and it always gets my heart rate up and soaking in sweat after the first 15 minutes!  Highly recommend for those that are used to working out.  If you're a beginner, you should start with the shorter Tae Bo and work your way up!",1420070400,4,929,4.423529411764706

2876324,5,B000RXZIHU,"An amazing workout. I had never done Tae Bo before I go this DVD. I didn't know what to expect, but I didn't expect it to be this intense. I have used a lot of different workout videos that lacked; they didn't keep my interest, were easy, or too short. This one was none of those. It is a great length, and it is fun, but challenging. I did have to take a few breaks the first few times, but I always finished the workout. It will definitely get your heart pumping. You will feel great afterwards, tired, but great. This will stay in my workout routine for a long time.",1408492800,,569,4.135135135135135

2876344,2,B000RXZIHU,This workout isn't fun like the ones I did a decade ago. The music isn't anything you'd hear on the radio and the routines are boring. There's no fun and feels like no rhythm. I'm going to donate it and go back to Jazzercise,1404777600,,224,4.113636363636363

2876346,5,B000RXZIHU,"...unless your mother is amazingly fit, that is! I am such a die hard fan of Tae Bo. I've been buying these things since they were only on VHS, and no matter which one I pick up there's always the guarantee that I'm going to either pass out from exhaustion at the end or pass out from exhaustion in the middle lol. This DVD follows the same exact trend as my previous ones. Out of my entire collection of workout DVDs, this is probably my favorite because I always feel challenged by it. The short workout on this DVD is what I use the most since I admittedly have never made it through the entire longer workout (unless I did a considerable bit of stopping and wondering why I'd ever intentionally torture myself so). If you're someone who likes a full body workout, it doesn't get too much better than this.",1403827200,4,809,4.364238410596027
2876347,4,B000RXZIHU,Love this! It was so much fun and I burned so many calories. The dancing part is sort of goofy but makes for a good time. Overall I'd recommend this dvd. The moves are controlled but powerful enough and you will be sweating!,1403654400,,224,4.232558139534884

To make it more of a challenge and wrist and ankle wights and add free weights to certain exercises. At 221 pounds I tried to get through what I could until I could get through the whole workout. Even though it is high energy and it took several months I was able to get through the whole workout. Stick with it and you will see the results you want.

The first potion is an hour long. Amazingly, I can do the whole hr without breaks. A week ago I tried the other part which is 30mins long. Great leg work! just what I needed. I have lost 28lbs on TaeBo in 3months, not I only need to tone my legs/butt. This does it. I do forward it at 45min mark, there is some silly dancing that I can do without. I highly recommend!",1384300800,,543,3.9454545454545453
2876358,5,B000RXZIHU,"Medical experts have stated that maintaining your heart rate around 70% for over 90 minutes at least once a week is excellent way to increase calorie burn to loose weight.  I usually do long power walks at least 2 x week for 90 minutes.  Ultimate Tae Bo will be perfect for when the weather is too hot or too cold or raining.

This is 90 minutes of medium intensity cardio.  There is not floor work so it is all standing.  Billy warms up with slower cardio but he does not do his standard stretches and instead just builds intensity for ten minutes and then keeps it at this level. He does take two breaks - one around 40 minutes where they do some dance free style and then around 57 minutes where you can stop or continue on for another 30 minutes of cardio and standing exercises.  The mood is loose and Billy really seems to be enjoying himself and he even talks less than usual and focuses on having fun.

Some people have complained about the intensity being too low as compared to other Tae Bo workouts.  Tae Bo is what you put into it.  You can always wear  weighted gloves, take the moves high impact and do jumping jacks  or other moves while he talks or during the free style section.  For most people the breaks will be welcome and it will be a challenge to complete the dvd.  I found the intensity perfect for doing a LONG work out and have Zero dread factor when doing this.  I have even done if after  work because it is great for reducing stress and not so tough that I felt burned out.  I wore a heart rate monitor and burned around 1,000 calories for the first part and 433 for the second in total of 1:31 minutes.",1381017600,6,1632,4.25

Towards the end of the first hour, Billy struts his dance moves.  Yes, it's corny, but hey, it breaks up the monotony of an hour long workout.

I try to do this workout every two weeks since the full workout is 1.5 and with a small toddler I don't normally have that kind of time everyday.  Although Billy gets the counts off from side to side (no surprise here if you have other videos) it's not that bad.  He adds a few new moves (machine gun), pulsing squats, and the cross jab that are fresh to try..he also tries to have fun as he breaks out in a random dance session during some of the standing ab exercises.  He does repeat the jab sequence after he gives a water break after the first hour and before you begin the last 30 minutes.

2876387,5,B000RXZIHU,"I have always loved Tae Bo and thought Billy Blanks was the best fitness instructor out there. I have tried his other workouts and they were great. I decided to get this one because I am freshening up my fitness DVDs and this one was a steal! It is a 90 minute workout and it works you head to toe. There is a pause at the 56 minute mark for those who just want an hour workout, but doing those full 90 minutes is a blast from start to finish. There are no dull parts, and there is even a free style dance segment which is sooo fun. Especially after all that hard work. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get in shape, and for anyone who wants a long cardio workout. This is perfect!! 5 stars!!",1367539200,2,703,4.0647482014388485

Folks who are new to Tae Bo, or any work-out requiring much balance/coordination (such as Zumba), may be best off purchasing a dvd that goes a little more slowly. This is a FAST-PACED, HIGH-IMPACT dvd that combines the most challenging Tae Bo moves. I can only do about 40 minutes of this before I want to keel over (and I'm a 23 year old fit female who enjoys marathon training and challenges).

2876399,4,B000RXZIHU,I enjoy this DVD. I have done Tae Bo on and off for a few years. It works you all over and it is at a steady pace. You get a great workout. You can work out for 90 minutes and burn over 900 calories. If you haven't got time for the full 90 minutes you can do 60 minutes. If you haven't time for that you can do the turbo charged fat burner workout. It takes about 23 minutes.,1355097600,,375,3.7

I like that Billy is giving little pep talks and encouragement all the way through this without seeming fake or cheesy. I had to stop and chuckle at one point when I was about to call it quits for the night and he leans in to the camera, looks right in the lense and encourages you to try just a little harder. You really feel like you are a part of his workout team and he is speaking to you.

Not intimidating in the least and he is seen giving positive and constructive criticism to the crew throughout the whole video, which really helped me get in the proper form for the best results.

LOVE this one, have ordered a couple more of his DVDs and am sorry I didn't try these earlier!

Also, I have back and neck problems.. this video is very low impact as far as stress on joints but keep your remote handy for frequent pauses to catch your breath!",1353024000,2,1128,4.286384976525822

2876402,5,B000RXZIHU,"I found this in my closet after having bought it last year. Took it out and it was the first time I tried it. I wanted to see how far in it I could actually get without passing out!  The good news is that as someone else said here 'it is totally do-able'. It is.  You are pushed to constantly keep moving, you never stop, but in between kicking sets, you'll bring it down a notch with some arms, then ramp it up again to where you are breathless, but back down again to something a bit easier, still moving, still sweating, still a challenge. However it isn't non stop torture. Some of his other workouts you are yelling in pain at your glutes when they are burning - this isn't that kind of workout.

The moves he picks are moves designed to be used in a 90 minute program that will not kill you but can be used in conjunction with other moves so that you are getting a full 90 minute workout which is a total body workout.

I actually kept up with it. I was never so wiped out that I couldn't do it. I kept water nearby, took some sips when needed, if they were bouncing with a lot of energy and I couldn't keep that energy level up, then I bounced lower to catch my breath. All in all it's a great workout. He will tell you right in it - this is not an everyday workout. Possibly just a once a week workout or on days here and there when you are feeling stronger.

The music is pretty good, he is VERY encouraging and positive throughout, he does do some funky dance moves in it which are funny at a point when you are starting to get kind of burnt with kickboxing.. made me laugh. Great workout for those days when you want/need an extra long workout. I recommend it.

Also - its low impact, you never go onto the floor either.",1350864000,3,1731,4.106508875739645

2876408,5,B000RXZIHU,"I have been buying from Amazon for years and over the years us Amazon shoppers know sometimes the reviews are ""on point"" and other times they are not. Well, this time Amazon reviewers got it right! This video is the best total body, core/cardio/endurance/conditioning workout I have done. I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser and was able to complete the full 90 minutes, although I modified some of the routines because of old back/shoulder injuries, but this will be my WEEKLY workout on Sundays to start the week off right! I also added 1 lb weighted hand gloves, which gave my a nice, subtle burn to my upper body, while completing the workout. I plan to use this when I know I am going out to eat or want to indulge in some pizza or pasta, so I don't gain! Thanks Amazon shoppers for getting this one right! SO glad I purchased this!

My *only* issue with this DVD is there is not a sufficient cool down, given the intensity of the workout. Billy does his traditional ""woo saa"" with arm movements to cool down and that simply is not sufficient to stretch out your traps/lats/abs/quads/hammies/calves. So rather than do his cool down, I make sure I stretch using cool downs I've done before from Jillian Michael's and the Firm DVD's. Still a great workout!",1332028800,,1266,4.601769911504425

Billy is his usual self, motivating and willing you along. If you want to increase stamina and push yourself to the max this is one dvd for you.",1331856000,,451,3.8085106382978724
2876410,5,B000RXZIHU,"Yes, it's 90 minutes. You can read what the other reviewer say about the content. I want to add that even though long and tough, it's not as tough as 'Basic Training' in intensity. For this workout, it's how much power and focus you put into it that makes the difference.

Of course, you'll have to call on your mental powers to go the distance and that's a great thing about this workout. However, there are no bands for resistance, no gut busting push-ups or sit -ups. In fact, no floor work at all. Just a high speed, non-stop karate style work out with no break, except for the hour mark where you can quit. But why quit?

However you will be tested physically and mentally. But it's not the monster drop dead workout you might fear. It's all up to what you put into it.

I recommend for the super fast combinations of kicks and punches to not necessarily go at Billy's speed, until you are up to it. Better to have good form, focus and power than to fall all over the place trying to keep up. So just don't look at the screen for those fast combos and do your own speed.

I found that 'mirroring' Billy is better than following his 'left' or 'right' instructions. So when he kicks with his right, you kick with your left, like looking into a mirror.

There's lots of fun stuff like sliding left and right and punching. And at the 50 minute mark you get to do 30 seconds of crazy 'free style' dancing. And at that point, anything to break up the action and have a laugh is appreciated.

Bottom line, a terrific workout, you'll sweat a lot, and burn a ton of calories. But the intensity is up to you. So be like Rocky and 'Go the distance.' Your mind will benefit as much as your body. So have no fear.",1331510400,,1705,4.246913580246914

1)Taebo Ripped Extreme
2)This Is Tae Bo
3)Taebo Cardio Explosion
4)Ultimate Taebo
5)Ultimate Bootcamp

Comparing Ultimate Taebo to #1, #2 and #3 it is not that great. I would Highly suggest #2 above all of them. I would then pick #3 then #1. I am leaving out Ultimate Bootcamp because it is not a cardio workout. That DvD is for building muscles and man does it ever. I won't write a review for it yet though.

I did sweat a good bit from this video but I wasn't nearly out of breath like I am from #2. Most of the moves you see on this DvD you will see on the 3 I recommend. It makes sense though since this DvD(Ultimate Taebo) came first. The workout is good but I found it lacking in intensity. If you want itensity go with #2 and #3. I didn't like the dance moves around the 50 minute mark of the video. I'm not a dancer. If I wanted to dance I would buy Zumba. I want a kickass kick and punch video and didn't get it from Ultimate Taebo. Again #2 and #3 much better.

And I remembered Tae Bo from the 90's and how it kicked my arse with zero fancy equipment, no high impact, and pure sweat.  Now Billy Blanks has a billion different videos available after all this time, so I looked for the one closest to the original, and this one turned out GREAT!!!  Every single muscle felt it and while it's fast paced, he also breaks it up perfectly in prepping you for each new move while still keeping you going going going!

I do agree with the other reviewers that the freestyle part near the end was just, well, awkward. Yes, kudos to BB for having a good time but you gotta admit it's kind of like seeing your uncle gettin' funky.  But hey, I'm in my house alone doing this so it makes me keep punchin' and stuff during all that.  Tao Bo is not only a great calorie burner but also awesome for stress relief.

I sometimes do the entire 90 minute but sometimes I break them up. The 30 minute fat burning workout is good too. They must have the workout rooms temperature turned way up because I barely break  out in a sweat with the 30 minute workouts on Taebo and everyone on the video is soaking wet.,1326931200,,540,4.09433962264151

This is probably the closest thing to his first video as far as intensity.  I really liked this.  We all know Billy is funny to listen to.  But he actually tries to dance and act silly for a few moments.  That made this quite funny for a few minutes.  It is intense but his freestyle dancing segment for 5 minutes was actually entertaining and felt like a needed break if you are going to try to to complete the 89minutes. The tape starts off with an hours and then it looks like a break for a minute then it goes into a 30 minute work out. When you are short on time you can just do the 30 minute segment.

I would recommend this one. Fyi, His amped up series is not bad but this is better and is a return to the old Billy.  The amped up dvds are not as intense as this one and seem to be a mix of strength training and some old taebo remnants.

The only thing I wish was included are his weighted sticks he has through part of his videos. You can still do his video without it, but it wasn't advertised that you should have one well enough on the site or on the DVD.

I like the music and intensity and the fact that it is long enough that you can get a full work out.  I do however like that there is a ""turbo"" work out option.  I use that sometimes just to feel the burn.  It is about 32 minutes for the turbo and it definitely makes you work out.  This isn't a beginners Taebo at all.  I had been working out for a while when I found this at the store.  It definitely takes a lot of hand and eye coordination to get this down.  Once you get to the freestyle then you know that you've gone 59 minutes and it is so encouraging.  I would say if you want more an intense work out and your looking to be pushed this is the best way to go.

I also wanted to add that I do this work out 3 - 4 times a week and saw results right away. It works your whole body and once you master the moves you will feel the results.  If you do not learn the moves you will not feel the burn or even break a sweat.  This dvd does NOT require any additional equipment.

Once you master the moves (Lifting your knees well above the stomach, kicking your legs well above the torso without hyper-extending your knee, and really mastering the moves, like Shellie***) this can be one of the most intense workouts you will ever do.
FYI: Trying the video a few times with poor form does not count.

I have been doing this workout once a week for over a year now, and I definitely have seen major results.

For more intensity, I skip the initial slower sections in the video (Where he is explaining how to do the actual move), and jump straight into the fast movements of the exercise and continue through the reps as he begins them.
Also, instead of stepping side to side in between the sets, I alternate squat jumps with jumping jacks.

This is a great video for endurance, and it takes time (patience + commitment) and effort to master the moves, once you really get the technique down, you can always modify movements to increase the intensity.",1285372800,2,1124,4.656565656565657

2876458,5,B000RXZIHU,"I don't understand the bad reviews for Ultimate Tae Bo--I think it's great! I have a large collection of Tae Bo DVDs, and haven't found one I didn't like (of course there's some I enjoy more than others). A couple reviewers indicated that this workout wasn't challenging enough; one even went so far as to say she ""didn't break a sweat."" If you do the moves correctly, you'll sweat--trust me! Just ask the soaked clothes I had to peel off after 89 minutes! I've been working out for years and am very fit little lady, and I still found it challenging. Someone said the free style dancing was ""a waste of time."" I guess that all depends on the person, but my daughter (13 years old) and I LOVED it. Another reviewer said that the old Tae Bo Advanced workouts are not available on DVD, but that's incorrect because I own the DVD. At least she was right when she said that the Tae Bo Advanced was a great and challenging workout. I don't mean to pick on the previous reviewers, and some points just come down to personal preference, but to say this workout isn't challenging is just plain poppycock.

And if you don't have 89 minutes to spare, you can choose to do the 28 min workout. Some of the exercisers in this portion use the amped bar, but it is not necessary. You could incorporate light weights if you wanted to, but the workout is fine without any bells or whistles.

August, 2016: I'm editing this to add that the old Tae Bo Advanced DVD that I'm referring to, is actually a different workout than what the other reviewers were talking about. They were actually correct...and I was wrong (ouch!) The DVD I own is called Tae Bo II Get Ripped. It has 6 workouts on 2 DVDs: Instructional, Basic 1, Basic 2, Advanced 1, Advanced 2, and an 8-Minute workout, plus ""Special Features."" The original Advanced Workout is available on VHS, through Amazon. You could always buy the VHS, then convert it to digital/DVD.

Billy Blanks Ultimate Taebo is truly the ultimate workout.  It is divided into two sections:  an hour long routine followed by a half an hour routine.  The idea is to do the hour and a half workout once a week.  But, it's also great to do the 30 minute segment when you're strapped for time.  Also, the hour long routine can be done exclusively and you still get a great, full workout.  I highly recommend this one!",1261008000,2,629,4.585585585585585

GO TO THE FINISH LINE! LOL. This workout is for an hour, then there's the extra 30 minutes, that you feel you won't be able to do, but I have a few times..and it's so awesome when you finish.

2876462,4,B000RXZIHU,"As a Kickboxing-Taebo enthusiastic I decided to purchase Billy Blanks Ultimate Tae Bo workout DVD, and try it out from the comfort of my own home. If you need to loose weight, hate germs, and hate gyms that always have too many model wannabes competing with other people in stationery treadmills (yes, they do that) then this workout is perfect for you.
Blank's Ultimate Taebo is ""an extreme, heart-pumping fitness challenge,"" that will leave you begging for more. Your muscles will be sore; no doubt about that, but your mind and body will feel revitalized. The 90-minute DVD includes choreographic movements with boxing and kickboxing elements such as uppercuts, punches, kicks, and lots of cardio. I will recommend the workout for rhythm-impaired people because Mr. Blanks makes it stupid-proof. He explains step-by-step what you need to do. You almost feel he is right there next to you helping you punch harder and kick higher. He reminds you to breath, keep your abdominals tucked in, and to ""feel"" the workout, but more importantly, to have fun.
The workout consist of different series of sets of eight repetitions each, starting with a 10 minute warm-up to test your ability to perform the entire routine. Mr. Blanks encourages you to try it at your own pace and ""take your time,"" because ""this is not a workout you do everyday."" Due to its intensity you will be working a wide range of muscles instead of a particular group. It doesn't seem much, but I can tell you it requires a lot of energy. If you can make it to the fourth repetition of each set, you are a pro. Another thing I like about Blank's videos is his team, because they all look like your next-door-neighbor; regular people, with no pretensions. Also, he makes them part of the work put by demonstrating how to or how not do certain movements. Shelley, his wife, is the one that always seems to cheer the others, and the living proof that TaeBo pays off. She is ""an accomplished martial artist"" with a six-pack of steel.
The downside of the whole DVD is the music. Is not very catchy, and lacks the enthusiasm that Blanks and his mates exude during the routine. I wish it were more aggressive like the Rotterdam Terror Corps music, or at least louder.
Overall, I am very likely to continue my routine with Ultimate Tae Bo because is full of positive reinforcement and encouraging words. There is cero judgment, cero boot camp style, and cero threatening environment. Thank you Billy Blanks for doing such a good job and for letting people like me to work out from the comfort of their own home.",1253664000,5,2568,4.708888888888889

I also have 3 other Tae Bo DVDs, but I have to say none of the newer workouts and especially ""Ultimate"" Tae Bo compare to the original. What's great about the original workout was the intensity of it, Billy Blanks would start you out with a technique and then increase the speed and intensity of it without and breaks in between. This DVD has nothing like that. I used to sweat bullets doing the orginal Tae Bo Advanced on VHS and with this DVD, I barely broke out a sweat. This DVD is good...but not great like it used to be. If you love everything Tae Bo, then this is for you but if you want a true challenge(and to burn over 800 calories like I do in less than an hour) then buy Tae Bo Advanced, it's only on video but it's very good.",1250380800,2,857,4.076923076923077

There are lots of ""resting"" periods - what you get with this one is just a longer video (1 hour and 33 min).  It has a ton of the original Taebo moves and less of the moves done in the bootcamp series, bootcamp elite or the amped series.

I have to say, the workout is a little long.  So long, in fact, that after an hour I had to stop because I had to attend to my little one.  So really, I am not sure how much longer it is.  But the way I look at it, even if you have to stop after, say 45 minutes to an hour, you're still getting an awesome workout and burning LOTS of calories! I just made sure to get in a good stretch after I stopped the workout.  And if you do have the time to finish the whole thing, you are definitely getting your money's worth!

I have tried all of the DVDs in the Amped series, and this is by far my favorite.  I just felt like I was really getting a better overall workout with this one.  The others that use the Amplifier bar seem to focus too much on the upper body.

I don't have to rush to the gym to attend a specific class at a a specific time.  I don't have to pay montly gym membership dues.  I can do it in the comforts of my home at the time and at the pace of my choice.  I burn upto 460 calories in an hour and what else you can ask for.  I have seen my body change right in front of eyes only after 2 weeks.

This is not rocket science, this is cardio.  Simple rule, burn fat with cardio, tone and build muscles with strenght training and add portion-control and watch calorie-intake and you will be a winner.  Looking and feeling great is a life-style which is different than achieving the weight-loss/looking good via diet pills.  Healthy life style renders results slowly but surely!

With the combination of this DVD and strength training exercises twice a week, and healthy diet, I can confidently say that any one can achieve weight-loss.  In addition, by following the cardio + strenght training + healthy diet regimen, it is very easy maintain a healthy life style in this fast paced society.

This is a great program to build cardio endurance.  However, one must be very careful with the form with jabs, upper-cuts, and hooks because if done incorrectly it can cause shoulder injury.

Ultimate Tae Bo is a great combination of heart-pumping cardio aerobics and muscle toning/strengthening as well. It is ultimately a super fat blaster.

The DVD consists of a main workout that doesn't use any of Billy Blanks special equipment (which is good, because I don't own any of it). It's challenging, and when I did it the first couple of times, I had to take a short break in the middle because I was practically gasping for air! Toward the end, Billy threw in a super fun dancing segment, which felt extremely good after the long workout. It really rejuvenated everyone and it even got me laughing. The second part is shorter and ""turbo-charged"" so it packs a lot into about a half an hour. That segment, however, uses that baton-looking thing (I forgot what its officially called). I don't have one, but I don't find it necessary, as I still get a really hard workout. There are even a few people in the video who do the modified versions of the moves for people who don't have one, so it's really not an issue.

The workout attempts to incorporate too many complicated ""aerobics"" type moves which require a lot of switching legs/turning around/learning combinations, but is more of a pain in the butt than an intense workout.  I found myself fast-forwarding through much of the workout, especially the attempts at incorporating your own freestyle ""hip hop"" moves--another waste of time.  On the original VHS, you can really feel your butt and abs burning, especially during the floor work, and I always had sweat dripping down my face.  This video does not include the same floor work, I barely broke a sweat, and it drags on, and on, and on...I tried it on 2 different occasions hoping I would warm up to it, to no avail.

It's as though you all forget that those workouts include a 5 minutes warmup and that the second workout contains a floor segment. Not exactly calorie-blasting. Plus those workouts only include about 43 minutes of cardio. I need more.
I'll give you this: this workout has a few slow moments such as hip rotations or 1/2 time demos that could be shorter, but I just modify by going faster or doing other Tae Bo moves. In 84 minutes I only did this 5 or so times. That's right: 84 minutes. The last 10 or so are standing leg raises and the like, but after 70 minutes of cardio only slowed every once in a while you are ready for standing/toning. No warmup (although it starts a little slower) and no floor work. It's the best of Tae Bo moves, some new coreograhy and some silly dance moves that come right when you're taking yourself too seriously.
I couldn't do this every day like I could with Turbo Jam, one because it's really long and two because it's more athletic than fun, but I appreciate the length and intensity on days I can't run due to weather.
I would recommend getting weighted handgloves. They really intensify cardio kick workouts.

This DVD includes 2 separate workouts:
1. 90 minutes ""Ultimate Tae Bo"" is really a ""test"" of your physical endurance. Billy and his entourage really make this an easy to follow yet challenging workout. I like it that he starts each sequence slow so you can get the moves down. Then they speed is up for the challenge. After just about every sequence you get a short breather (break), but keep your heart rate up. During the workout Shellie and the others count 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 so you can work on just getting through the group of 8 repetitions. I have not made it through this workout, but I will someday!

2. 25 minute ""Turbo Charged Fat Burner"". For an easier/shorter workout this is a great challenge too and will help you work up to the 90 minute routine. Half the class uses his new workout bar, but you don't have to use it as the other half of the class performers the move without his special bar.

You also get a ""Learn the Tae Bo Moves"" section. I have not checked this out yet as I did not have trouble following his moves. I have difficulty with some of the fast-paced workouts on the market as I am somewhat uncoordinated with the foot and arm movements. This one is easy to follow and quite rewarding!

If you use this tape 2-3 times per week you will surely get results!!! You will lose weight (if you also follow a healthy eating routine) and gain muscle and definition.

There are enough pauses between each exercise set that I could catch breath. I was able to get through the whole 1.5 hours on my first try. Each set begins with a slow version of the exercise and then it get's faster. Even though I was kind of fumbling around during the faster pace, I think I'll get the hang of it after a few tries...I'm not the most coordinated person in the world.
Overall, it gives a great work out for your core. Your arms also get quite a bit of a work out even though no props or weights are used. The leg work is quite good as well.

Keeping in mind that nothing really replaces an in-the-gym session where you are keeping pace with your fellow exercises and under the watchful eye of your instructor, ""Billy Blanks Ultimate Tae Bo"" delivers what would be expected for a mainstream at-home workout session.

For anyone who has done Tae Bo before, this video ranks in the middle level with regard to intensity.  Blanks does not start this session off with his usual stretches (surprise).  Instead he goes into his signature butterfly/punching warm-up immediately and follows up with moves that are familiar to any Tae Bo devotee and therefore seem 'no brainer' rather than 'strainer'.

As a long time runner who is experiencing some hip discomfit, I decided it was time to return to Billy to tighten up some core muscles.  Approaching this exercise with Billy's voice shouting out ""tighten up"" and ""suck in those abs"" has enabled me to use a Pilates technique to almost everything  physical that I do.  Tightening up the core and allowing your arms and legs to move from that powerhouse I believe is the longterm key to longevity. As we age, we want to continue to have freedom of movement without pain.  Blanks promotes this simple yet life-giving idea throughout his entire series.  He appeals to both men and women who like the idea of kickboxing moves with a Pilates foundation without the ballet association or zen of yoga. After just a week of doing 45 to 1 hour of Tae Bo per day, I can already feel the difference in my hip.  Blanks' exercises are tucking me in and reminding me how to move efficiently again.

This workout is long--90 minutes with a break after the first hour which allows those who do not wish to continue to pick up the next day for a shorter session with the remaining half hour. About 45 minutes into the workout, Billy abandons the punches and kicks and breaks it up with some dance moves which detract from the overall pace and because they are unexpected will most likely lower the heart rate at a crucial fat burning period.

Some of the combination exercises seemed clunky to me--in his most recent video sets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Blanks-Tae-Bo-2004-Capture-the-Power/dp/B0006B4NS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Blanks' Tae Bo 2004: Capture the Power</a>Billy seems to be relying on punch combinations that are offbeat and move you around the floor rather than actually work on core. Instead of pumping the action up, this reliance on combinations slows things down because it necessitates repeated instruction.  When Billy sticks to the format that he made famous -- standing stomach crunches, kicks above the waist and down on the floor butt burning, his sessions give me the workout I truly desire.  Note:  Sadly, as there is no 'on the floor' portion of the workout in Ultimate Tae Bo, I decreased my overall rating of this product down one star.

Blanks includes an interesting ""Meet Billy"" segment to the DVD and thankfully the 'Learn the Moves' instructional portion is relegated to the Bonus Material section so that we pros can skip the intro and get to the meat of the workout.

Bottom line?  I like Blanks--he makes mistakes which are not edited out of the overall presentation, but I think this just makes him human.  You cannot beat his motivation, his amped up enthusiasm or the fact that his body looks just as good as it did over ten years ago when he started this series.  That said, he must be onto something.  Recommended with the caveat that exercise is relative to your own fitness level and what you have become accustomed to doing.  This is 90 minutes of standard Tae Bo signature moves.  Nothing new--just extended.

2876491,2,B000RXZIHU,"I really do not understand everything that is written on this site about this DVD.  I kept reading how intense this workout is and I must disagree strongly.  I have been using the TaeBo II Get Ripped DVD for almost 2 years now and I have grown tired of it. So I went looking for something new from the Billy Blanks series.  I wanted to be sure it was going to be a nonstop intense workout, which is what the Get Ripped workout is.  NO GO!  This Ultimate DVD does not live up to its name.  The biggest problem is that there are too many slow periods.  With each new move, Billy does at least three slow sets before moving to the double time.  Then he only does two maybe three double time sets.  That is not what I call intense.  If you want intense, get Get Ripped.  I guess I am back to my same old workout until I can find something that lives up to its advertisement.",1227312000,8,870,4.088757396449704

It is def. for the advanced exerciser, however, I must say that this is one of the most effective video's I have. It makes all of my other workout videos look like nothing. I do have to add that I did not like the short dance intervals in the middle of the workout, but I think he put those in there to lighten the mood. This is money well spent, I would recommend it to anyone looking to get in serious shape without having to leave their house! A++ exercise video!",1224201600,,615,4.008130081300813

Billy may have good technique but this workout is really long and poorly filmed.  Billy talks at the same time as another girl repeatedly counts down 1.2.3.4... for every movement--very distracting not to mention annoying.  Everything seems so disorganized and tacky.  The room looks like an old cigar lounge. I have no desire to work out with it. Maybe there are other Taebo videos that are filmed better but I don't want to waste any more money to find out.  Another option would be Turbo jam (I got mine for $12 by a seller here on amazon)which is similar technique but filmed much better,not annoying, and better atmosphere.  Also, 30 day shred by Jillian Michaels is professional, pleasing to the eyes and ears, and is just 3 different 20 minute workouts you choose by difficulty level.",1217030400,4,930,4.628048780487805

2876496,4,B000RXZIHU,"This is a great workout. Results were seen in less than 2 weeks. Abs and leg muscles got very developed. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that ultimate would indicate very high intensity but despite it being a great workout I wouldn't say its ""ultimate intensity"". I probably couldn't keep up if it was anyway, but someone in top shape may hope for just a little more intensity.",1215820800,3,392,4.3108108108108105
2876497,5,B000RXZIHU,"When Billy Blanks says at the beginning that ""this isn't a workout you do every day""...he wasn't joking!  I embarked on a weight loss program about 5 months ago, using Tae Bo and Turbo Jam on alternate weeks. I reached somewhat of a plateau, so decided to try this one since it was his longest workout. No worries about a plateau now! LOL! I must say that it kicked my butt, and this is definitely NOT for someone just starting a workout program because you might get frustrated. It is very fast paced, and he uses his own style of interval training (as most of his workouts)...but this one just seemed like it was moving a lot faster than the regular ones.

Needless to say, I was already dripping sweat from head to toe at the 40 minute mark. As always, you can adjust your involvement in the exercise (putting maximum effort into the moves, which I did). I managed to finish the tape, and he seems to offer ""pep talks"" and encouragement at just the right time when you're thinking about giving up. He even throws in some dance moves and gives you a chance to ""cut loose"", which I really enjoyed!  It was fun and it helped me stay motivated to finish.

I highly reccomend this workout.  Again, if you are just starting out with an exercise program, don't try this one out the gate. Or, go ahead and buy it, and set a goal for yourself once you reach a plateau or feel you are ready for the challenge and then go for it!",1213747200,3,1421,4.307116104868914
2876498,5,B000RXZIHU,"I hadn't done Tae Bo for a while and of course I had to come back with the Ulimate DVD...it's a great workout, but tough!
I exercise with DVD's 4-6 days a week and I am continually looking for workouts that are: 1.  More than 45 minutes of continuous cardio, 2.  A continuous workout, 3. An intermediate/advanced level workout, 4, Interesting with good music, and 5.  enthusiastic instructor.  This DVD contains all this and more.
It begins with a ""blended"" sort of workout, meaning that the warm-up moves straight to the aerobic practice with no big drop in intensity--it slowly builds.
The 90 minute workout would be familiar to all past Tae-Bo users (punches, kicks, slides with punches and kicks, leg liftss, etc), but about midway through, Billy adds a little funky dancing that brought a smile to my face...not really tough, but it was a fun and a change of pace.  It was nice to see the exercisers smiling and having a good time.
I would recommend this DVD to a more intermediate/advanced home exerciser because of the length of the practice and also the intensity.  Granted, a beginner maybe able to start with this and do all the moves at a slow pace.  Then, that person would have a DVD that they could use for a very long time.
This is a great cardiovascular workout.  I like it!!!",1212710400,26,1292,4.586956521739131

Do not let the word ""ultimate"" scare you away from chosing this DVD for a regular workout--it is fairly entertaining.  Just choose another DVD if you want a high-energy workout.

My heart was pumping so hard I could feel the rush of calories melting off. I did it for the first time last night and I did it again this  morning! Wow! What a rush. I made it through the entire 90min. Even though he says you don't have to do this every day because it is very intense, i am going to do this first thing every morning. It's so much fun and you don't want to stop eventhough you feel your about to pass out - Billy gives you the motivation to keep going.

2876514,4,B000RXZIHU,"I started off with the Tae Bo VHS videos- the 4 pack that was for sale in many stores....Well, I decided I needed some new DVDs, and I loved the VHS's so much!

This definitely keeps a good pace, it isn't EXCESSIVELY fast, like I felt the pace would get sometimes with the VHS. It seems like Billy does a better job of keeping track of his exercises and reps (which he had serious problems with in the VHS)!!!

This DVD is for the more average to advanced ""athletic"" person. However, this is certainly something you could build up to if you're just starting out with his Tae Bo tapes, or with cardio exercise.

The instruction is difficult, if you're not used to doing his Tae Bo. I feel like I pick things up relatively quickly- he added some new, fun, fast-pace exercises which I caught quickly...but there were some I couldn't get the hang of the first time I tried to do them!

This is a great DVD to do if you're used to Billy Blanks Tae Bo workouts- but if you're a beginner, I'd work your way up to this one!

The Tae Bo DVDs are totally worth the workout, the hard work, and the total body shaping and cardio benefits you get! I'd definitely consider buying more of his DVDs!",1204243200,5,1183,4.286995515695067

Who has 89 minutes to work out?  Anyway, I read reviews on it this morning and decided to try it out for myself and add some variety to my workout this week. I did not know that you had an option of stopping after 55 minutes.  Well although I was pretty worn out after the 55 minutes, I challenged myself to the additional 30 minutes.  I was able to finish but I am very tired and my body feels a bit like jello.  Billy lets you know in the workout that you should only do this one once a week and I see why.  Overall, this is a great workout if you are a tae bo lover.  I am shocked at one of the reviews I read that said this one did not even make them sweat.  Very unbelieveable!  Fun but hard workout.

I just know that when I do this workout I do some stretches before I start the workout. But I love this! It's a long workout, you can choose 1hr, or continue onto 90 min.

I would highly recommend the Advanced TaeBo DVDs, which are tough and really make you sweat. This one is more like his basic workouts, slow paced, with really bad music. I had to plug in the Advanced workout afterwards and do that to feel like i've accomplished something. Also, not particularly motivating seeing Billy with a bit of a gut, Shellie and the rest of his ""supporters"" sporting bellies, cellulite and fat instead of the lean, muscular and toned people he had in other workouts.
