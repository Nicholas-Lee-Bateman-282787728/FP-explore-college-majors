8087567,3,B000BK537O,"First, a technical complaint. Although  all the DVDs from which these excerts come have 3 audiio tracks (PCM, DD5.1 & DTS 5.1), this DVD is only PCM stereo. Why can't we hear the superior 5.1 audios the audio of the origonal DVDs?

The performances are all good, but none are outstanding. Also, and this is a matter of personal taste, I do not care for most of the selections. If the purpose of a sampler is to persuade the viewer to buy some of the DVDs which it samples, this sampler was unsucessful with me, since I am not interested in buying any of them.",1208995200,,559,4.314285714285714
