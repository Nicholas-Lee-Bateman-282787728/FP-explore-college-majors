4321149,2,B004BZ5AQO,"When I first started watching this film, I turned it off 5 minutes in after witnessing what I believed was some pretty bad acting (especially the father).  Additionally, the filmography left much to be desired. However, being a hugh horror fan, I just had to give it a try the next day.  I am glad I did.  Although the only decent actor in the film was the young man who played the oldest son, the movie had some pretty spooky scenes.  The ending was almost a tear jerker and set it apart from other movies in this class.  All in all, it really was not a bad film. I have seen a lot worse.",1327104000,17,589,4.131578947368421
4321150,5,B004BZ5AQO,"I really enjoyed this movie, thought it was well done can't believe they pulled it off with a budget of 30,000 and it being there FIRST full length film.

Hats off to these Indie film makers.",1309478400,3,328,4.576271186440678
4321151,1,B004BZ5AQO,This movie is so awful.  Cinematic technique makes it look like a low budget porno.  The microphone has a frigging echo!  The acting in community theater has more depth.  Avoid this movie at all costs!,1301616000,3,201,4.6571428571428575

4321153,1,B004BZ5AQO,"Unwatchable.
I don't expect it to be a GOOD movie, mind you. I rarely find a straight-to-video ""horror"" flick that's worth rating more than two stars, the occasional three. But I couldn't get five minutes into this movie before I gave up and turned it off to find something else. Not because of the bad acting (although there is plenty of that going around), but because there is something obviously wrong with the sound. It's got some kind of echo going on that is really distracting. The up-front-and-center sound seems okay. Someone speaking, for example, comes out clearly. But any background noise behind the speaking, like music or children screaming or telephone ringing, holds a really annoying echo that just makes the movie unwatchable. I can only hope it IS an actual technical issue and not the creators attempting to make it seem more ""ominous"", because if it is, it backfired horribly.

If they get this issue sorted out, I'll give it another try. But there are plenty of other low-quality horror flicks to work through before coming back to this one, I'm sure.",1467676800,,1075,4.842391304347826

4321158,3,B004BZ5AQO,"This movie was clearly low budget. BUT it had potential. If they had a better budget, they could have afforded better picture quality, sound and actors. But the movie really had great ghosts, and the story was pretty good. I think the director did a great job, with the budget provided. I've seen bigger budget horror/suspense movies that were far worse. I would really rather give it 2.5 stars, but since that isn't possible here, 3 will have to do.",1458086400,2,450,4.6375

The acting isn't great (the lead dude's overacting isn't easily overlooked) but seriously, compared to most of the B rated, gosh AWFUL junk they try to pass off as movies in here, this isn't half bad. It's definitely watchable, with, what I thought, was a pretty good ending. So if you're surfing for a little something to pass the time, this will do the trick nicely.",1454889600,2,637,4.5

4321180,2,B004BZ5AQO,"This is one of those movies that you have to go into knowing it's not going to be great. But there is entertainment value, especially with the bad acting and lower-end production quality (although I have seen worse. Much worse). I will say that the older kid was a solid actor. I'm not sure if his parents overestimated the quality of this film or underestimated the quality of their son's acting skills, but he probably should not have been in this movie (given that his talent was superior to everyone else's).

The dad was easily the worst actor of the bunch. But it made the film more enjoyable. I'm not going to knock the kids, but they could have done a better job casting the two younger kids. The storyline was fairly bland. Some tense-filled, enjoyable spots here and there, but a lot of nothing going on throughout a majority of this film.",1421625600,,849,4.549019607843137
4321181,3,B004BZ5AQO,"It's watchable but it's certainly not a horror flick. It's more like a study of a marriage on the rocks and a wife with serious childhood memory issues.

4321183,4,B004BZ5AQO,"I must have started watching this one day when I was really exhausted and fell asleep, because it had a resume button in the thumbnail and I didn't remember watching it. Which I do being an insomniac, and has no initial bearing on the movie.
So with that being said,

I didn't thing it was half bad, I found it easy to watch, creepy enough to be slightly scary and the acting wasn't annoying.  When you put it down, I think the actor playing the oldest child was pretty good and if he stays in this medium and keeps working his craft he may just be a fine actor one day. But I do give him lots of credits for being the most enjoyable to watch.

The movie moves at a pretty decent rate so it doesn't have any lulls where it takes a sudden left turn. I think the story was solid and the ending made it original, The acting was good, and putting it mainly on the kids and then the Mom makes sense and ties it all together.

Which is why I gave it 4 stars. Ghost kids are always creepy. And the way these popped up even had me anticipating a jump scare or 3. They interacted with the family right away instead of some build up and acted differently with each person which was interesting to watch.  I enjoyed it and I didn't think I was going to for some reason. I'm just curious how that phone call goes at the end.",1413331200,,1312,4.089494163424124

4321186,1,B004BZ5AQO,"Oh where do I start? Very low budget beyond low budget. The acting horribly bad, and the whole time you see a apparition you think something is going to happen, then nothing. So the whole time you wait for something to happen you think something is going to happen and it leaves you at the high point for nothing to happen. It's like being on a roller coaster going up and getting stuck and never going down the big drop. You have to figure out the ending on your own. It really just was not anything you can get into just because the acting alone is so dry. The actors needed to learn how to really show emotion because this was close to bad porn acting...matter of fact they look like they were both porn stars trying something new....I can't give it anything more than one star and I hate giving something 1 star but it's all I can say it was worth from the acting to the script to the very end where you expected it to be intense and it left you high and dry.",1413072000,,963,4.1550802139037435

4321192,2,B004BZ5AQO,"It was a good story but the acting was pretty bad and it was hard to get past the bad acting, especially on the dad's part.  The filming was pretty bad also.  I liked the plot and if it were done better it would be a good movie but it was hard to get through.",1402444800,,259,3.690909090909091
4321193,3,B004BZ5AQO,"I watched to the end. And I wasn't sorry. Its hard to explain. When I started, I immediately noticed the subpar production values. Even some ordinary (i.e. not challenging) scenes are fuzzy and out of focus. Its obviously someone getting their feet wet in movie making. So from that point on, I watched it as if I had stumbled upon someone's home movie, just to see how it went. Compared to other micro-no to lo budget flicks that are uploaded here, that's a different reaction from me. I usually turn them off. I was curious though about the story. What was going on? Why? I kept thinking that whoever is responsible for this film actually grasped something important about movie making: its visual story telling. They respected the story and maintained it as its focus. They kept it simple and as a result, It cohered. A shout out to the makeup artists: the ghosts were great! Super job on them. So, there you have it. It is all of what people have said but it also has something than a lot of the others in the horrorible subgenre.",1401667200,,1034,4.50531914893617
4321194,2,B004BZ5AQO,"The right atmosphere, a house in a wooded area that's been renovated from it's dilapidated state; the family in peril, the doors opening by themselves, shadows, ominous music,  angst ridden pre-teens, apparitions. All the usual elements you expect in your supernatural movie... yet it all amounts to much ado about nothing! The adult actors emoted like amateurs just learning their lines, and had no chemistry as a couple whatsoever. The children fared just a tad better, possessing the typical traits of children in this type of movie: an angry, uncommunicative older brother; upset with his neglectful dad, who misses his games, etc., and two bratty younger siblings; both of whom see apparitions and find old relics of a time gone by. We hear the creepy music, and see the doors opening...we wait for something more to happen because we enjoy being scared but...we're not! Finally, we learn in flashback that it all has to do with the mother's childhood, but by then...who really cares? Glad it was a free viewing.",1401148800,,1017,4.982352941176471

There are some scenes introducing the ghost characters that are fairly well set up and do manage to add good atmosphere.  Unfortunately the ghosts just keep on popping in and out over and over till you quit ""feeling it"".  The end reveal would have been more powerful if some of the information had been delivered in the rest of the film...instead its all info dumped at the very end and then the film ends...

If you are in the mood for an easy going building up of suspense,  no real shocks but only evidence that something must be wrong here, then this is a movie that can be moderately enjoyable, though not exciting.

subtlety of what I thought should be more, actual, nail-biting horror, but soon realized that this was not what the director was going for. He was telling us a very convoluted and sorrowful tale of a mother's repressed memories of a childhood she had no recollection of.

It's sad, too, because the story line has great potential, with better acting, a bit of a re-write that doesn't include a climax that accompanies the ending so as to not drag on, and less hokey on the ""i rebuilt the family cabin"" without the spouse having a clue bit - seriously??  as if any husband could get away with that and himself not become a tortured corpse.

Wondering who on earth these terrifyingly awful actors were, I couldn't help but watch the credits and it all made PURDY good sense - nepotism at its, dare i say finest?!  I really hope the associate producer put up her own money on this one because if I were an investor I would be pissed that quality acting was sacrificed for a niece, cousin, or daughter's lame shot at their 15 minutes.

the BEST thing about this film, however, was that I am an Amazon Prime member and I didn't have to pay anything whatsoever to see it.",1363996800,9,1052,4.3520408163265305
4321219,1,B004BZ5AQO,"In some places the dialog was definitely bad and in other places I'm not sure if it was the dialog, the acting, or both that were bad.  In one scene the mom tells the little girl to calm down, but the little girl wasn't saying or doing anything to really call for it.

Then there were the continuity errors.  Like in one scene where the older son is outside and it is bright and sunny, he walks into the house, has a very short conversation with the younger son which ends with them saying goodnight?

The lighting was another issue.  The shots went from bright to dark to bright again.  In one scene the mother is in a bedroom which is nice and bright, when she looks out into the hallway not only is the hallway very dark but when the camera faces her the room looks dark behind her, yet when she turns and walks back into the room the room is bright.

The music track was very over-done.  There was a lot of spooky music when there was no call for the music to be spooky.  After a while it failed to lend atmosphere and just became monotonous.

I can forgive a lot if the story is good.  In this case, the story didn't seem to build.  It was ghosts here and ghosts there that no one was seeing, then they were seeing them, then BAM! the back story reveal. Through most of the movie the ghosts are just there, they aren't doing anything that gave hints at the back story.",1363737600,8,1373,4.178707224334601

4321222,1,B004BZ5AQO,"Ok, the birthday cake scene was kind of ominous, you got me. Mitch and Sara want to take their daughter Christina out to a cabin in the country to celebrate her birthday. It's a new cabin Mitch had built over Sara's old childhood home. The place is haunted by some Grudge-esque ghosts wandering around. I won't spoil the ending, but let's just say it ain't worth the trip.

There are some issues with the soundtrack. First of all, there was a weird buzzing and hissing present throughout many of the scenes. Also, whoever created the score was under the impression that this was a real nail-biter, and the most dramatic of dramas. Totally over the top! The only thing missing was a wacky zinger sound effect from the waking-up-from-a-dream, from a dream, from a dream scene.",1361318400,2,774,4.6911764705882355
4321223,2,B004BZ5AQO,"The (Grudge) it is not.
Underwhelming acting, bad banter, most dialogs sounds as if they were reading it all straight line for line. Must had been all family and friends playing the parts, because there was not one good actor among them, I caught myself wishing the killing would start just so this could be over quicker. Totally homemade and cheap in so many ways. Nothing of interest happens other than an occasional appearance from the dark-haired ghost girl; also there are a lot of dark and hard to see scenes so be ready to use your imagination. The flashbacks were so un-necessary and we could have learned more if it were just told to us. The hand that rocks the cradle might be another flick they were trying to copy. This was no real ghost story, more of a coming to terms with her past story.",1360972800,3,803,4.469387755102041
4321224,2,B004BZ5AQO,"Mitch (Joseph Anthony Jette) has some family issues which he tries to iron out by taking them to his wife's old family cabin. His kids include the sleep all day teen Scott (Nick Wolf) the younger Gavan (Sean Patrick Flaherty) and birthday girl Christie (Elizabeth Purdy). Scott is mad at his dad over his infidelity problem, missing his ball game, and not being able to deliver his lines in a convincing manner. The wife (Melissa Salinas) likewise has issues of which acting is the main problem. Dad loads everyone into the family Durango, a bit of a let down from the Griswold family truckster, but it does have its own odious theme music as the sound track didn't help the film any.

The cabin is supposed to be in a secluded woods, at least by the aerial view, yet when they drive up there is a curb and fire hydrant as well as a house across the road. From the kitchen window we can see another house nearby, which does not show up from outside camera angles.

Everyone loves creepy child ghosts until we get tired of them...and it is now official. I am tired of them. These ghosts can pop in and out of anywhere, but somehow need to open doors too.

At the end of the film, the ghost aspect is all tied together in one segment without any real allusion to it. It just hits you all at once.

4321225,1,B004BZ5AQO,"this movie is like one of many hundreds that could have just not been made. Theres nothing new here, nothing groundbreaking. There are a couple of creepy scenes, but they are borrowed in concept from other, better, movies, i.e. The Grudge. The Child actors are the best thing about this movie, especially young Sean Patrick Flaherty, who shows some acting range and ability. The adult actors have less acting ability and range than those in commercials or porn. The father seems tranquilized. The adult scenes remind me of spending time at the house of a couple that you know are breaking up, just uneasy and uncomfortable, nothing scary or interesting, just uneasy.  So, unless you are really bored on a desert island or locked up with this movie, find something else to do.",1356739200,2,775,4.827067669172933

4321227,1,B004BZ5AQO,"Most of the acting was terrible and way over the top. The movie has potential for being spooky but all of the atmosphere is nearly ruined by the poor sound quality and the constant over-use of echoes. Everything seems to have an echo except for the actors voices. The music, the sound effects, all end up sounding horribly canned with all the echoing. This movie is almost worth the rental price, but not quite. Hopefully the folks who made this film read this and take my feedback constructively. The children were better actors than the adults because they didn't over-dramatize things. I think sometimes people forget that there is a difference between stage and screen acting. You don't need the actors to work as hard because you have special effects that you can use in movies. If this were a stage production the acting may have been spot on.",1332892800,11,849,4.704697986577181

8422571,3,B004BZ5AQO,"Ominous begins showing a man walk up to an abandoned house.  The door opens by itself and he steps inside.  He tries to light a cigarette but the surrounding sounds of ghostly breathing makes him run outside.  6 months later we see kids playing in a home while their mom fixes them breakfast.  Her husband calls on the phone while flirting with his secretary.  He mentions a cabin where he wants to take his family on vacation.  When he comes home the family already has their bags packed!  Wow!  They don't even give the husband time to change his clothes, use the bathroom, check inside the house to make sure everything's fine before heading out including checking locked doors, or even eat dinner!

The father reveals his poor acting skills while driving in the vehicle.  He apologizes to his son for not attending his game and apologizes to his wife for not being around.  When the father stops at a convenience store to pick up some items the employees and customers stare him down.  If only he turned and noticed them I'm sure he'd feel uncomfortable!  He tells the cashier guy about the house he plans to stay in with his family.  Too bad these characters in the store don't play a bigger role.  When they arrive the older son takes off down a path out back.  He hears children laughing while listening to headphones and begins to panic.  He heads inside and talks to his younger brother about their upstairs bedrooms.  The wife implies sex when she tells her husband ""If there's something to show how grateful I am I'd do it"".

The wife wakes up later that night and walks around the dark house.  She wakes up her son who's sleeping on the floor.  The next day the father talks to his son again while chopping wood outside.  He promises he'll attend more of his son's games next year but the son shows disappointment.  The father throws his rag down in anger while the mother folds clothes inside.  Such cliched writing!  She sees her bedroom door open a moment later and while looking out the door a figure can be seen behind her.  Outside the young son makes the word ""Dork"" out of sticks on the ground before calling over his sister, and she assumes that word is directed towards her for some reason so they begin to fight.

While playing a game of hide and seek with her brother, the sister hides in a closet.  As the brother checks the closet a monster appears beside the girl but she escapes before seeing it.  She drops her doll and the monster grabs it.  After this the son refuses to put his phone down and upsets the father at the dinner table.  The two brothers talk about girlfriends.  The older one says ""Speaking of girlfriends, how's yours?"" directed to his father since he -and everyone else- knows he's cheated on their mother with the secretary.  This awkwardly ends dinner for everyone!

The husband and wife have a discussion in their bedroom after this.  The wife says no matter how hard she tries to move on from the husband cheating on her, she can't.  Someone always brings it up.  The son bringing it up though, that one stings!  The father and son discuss his cheating mistake.  The father says he thought he moved on but the son disagrees.  They settle their differences.  Later that night the daughter wakes up in bed to see two dead children looking down at her.  The wife leaves the bathtub and a ghostly figure crawls out of the tub behind her.  She turns around and it's gone.

The wife finds an old dirty doll and can't understand why her daughter plays with it.  Before the son walks outside to throw it away he apologizes for the things he said at the dinner table last night. While the daughter draws in her book two dead children stand beside her and watch.  She follows them up the stairs to the eerie bedroom where the door slams shut and the demented looking boy looks at her.  The brother finds the sister in the dark room and asks his sister who she's talking to.  She doesn't say.  This is the third time the picture turns so dark that it's hard to see anything.  The sister blows out her birthday candles in a dark room while the dead children stand behind her.

The mother finds a strange picture her daughter drew.  To be honest the picture didn't look strange at all but the mother thought it did.  The father thinks she's going through an imaginary friends phase.  The daughter wakes up and sees a figure standing in the corner of her bedroom.  When she jumps out of bed someone pulls her under the bed.  She then wakes up.  It was just a nightmare.  After checking under her bed she turns around and a demon figure tries to grab her.  Now she really wakes up!  The father suddenly has to leave for work after they have a birthday party for her daughter.  As the mother cleans up the birthday party plates and cups the front door opens by itself and the bathtub water turns on.  The mother asks her daughter if she's taking a bath.  Just then she looks outside and sees all three of her kids playing outside.  She walks up to the bathtub and doesn't see any water running when she pulls open the shower curtains.  While taking a bath the mother sees a bruise on her daughter's shoulders.  The daughter says to the ghosts ""Please go away"".

Later as the young son washes his hands in the bathroom sink, a figure of a little girl walks down the hallway.  When he looks in the mirror he sees the same figure behind him prompting the boy to turn out the lights to make it go away.  The mother wakes up to the sound of laughter outside in the rain.  The daughter becomes trapped in her bedroom.  As the mom tries to open the door she turns around and sees two ghostly kids on the other side of the room.  As the brothers and sister run outside, they see their mom lying on the floor inside with the door locked so they can't get inside.

The mother has a flashback that she's a child again and being helped up by her angry abusive mother.  She sees herself as a little girl with her mom in the bathroom.  The mother turns into a jerk by slamming dishes around when she returns to the kitchen.  Her other kids look at her like ""Why be so angry yo?""  The mother gets upset when her one daughter picks flowers.  She tells her other daughters to get out of the kitchen.  She slams slop down on their breakfast plates and asks her son why his father had to leave the son with her since he's not even her real kid.  Oh, this is why she's angry.  She's forced to take care of children that aren't hers (except for the one daughter I'm guessing- the woman/mother having this flashback).  Still, be less angry!

This angry mother gives all the pancakes to her one daughter apparently because she's her real kid whereas the others aren't.  The other kids look at her like ""Yo, where's MY pancakes!""  The mother compares the children she had with her ex-husband to her daughter from a separate husband and asks ""Why can't you be more like her?""  We see the angry mother cutting her one daughter's hair aggressively and calling her names.  She then drags her son by the back of the head across the floor and places him in a chest.  ""No dinner for you tonight!""

This woman continues to have more bad memories of her horrible childhood life involving her abusive mother.  It gets a LOT worse though.  She sees her abusive mother drowning her kids in a bathtub and dragging their dead bodies across the floor.  She sees her abusive mother burying the bodies in the back yard while she has a tea party by herself.  The mother asks her favorite daughter why she's so quiet and she says she misses her brothers and sisters.  The mother says ""I know, I miss them too.  I love them as much as I love you"".  Nah, that's not true!  Otherwise you wouldn't have killed them yo!  She then asks her daughter to come help plant flowers over the burial spot.  Now that's a rough childhood.

In the present the mother is so traumatized over the memories of her abusive mother and the way she killed her sisters and brother that the cops have to take her kids away as the movie ends.  Not the best ending I've ever seen.  Most movies have a payoff after a flashback, but this one... not really.  I kinda like the storyline changing in a way that I never saw coming.  I mean, who would've guessed these dead children are (at least I assume) the woman's sisters and brother haunting the place?  Who saw the storyline being tied into the woman/mother for that matter and her abusive mother being a murderer?  For a while the mother is just relatively quiet preparing a birthday part for her daughter and not particularly angry that her husband cheated on her (even when the son brings it up at the dinner table).  This woman had a HORRIBLE childhood with a terribly abusive mother that she kept secret until the end!

I don't think this movie's as lame as others do.  The quiet simple story around the house and the overall vibe makes me appreciate the more chilling moments involving the ghostly children when they occur, and they occur pretty often.  The movie relies pretty strongly on building to tons of eerie moments.  This movie isn't great of course, and the acting could have certainly been better, and there's way too many dark moments but I'd probably recommend this movie anyway.",1501286400,,9211,4.449700598802395
