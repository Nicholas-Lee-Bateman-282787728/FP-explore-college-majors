7075862,5,B00UZM8RN0,Great television show. I teach forensic science and I use the DVDs to present cases that are relevant to a particular topic that's being covered. The quality of the DVDs is good and I haven't had any problems as of yet. I'm glad they finally came out with the complete series.,1436140800,2,276,4.431372549019608

8708854,5,B00UZM8RN0,"Very interesting! Follows forensic sciences impact on homicide investigations. I just completed viewing the series and highly recommend it. Season 9 disc 4 had an issue with audio (the background noise was so loud that it was difficult to impossible to hear the narration). Other than that it was excellent video and audio throughout, and at $38.49 was way too good to pass on.",1464739200,2,377,4.90625
8708855,4,B00UZM8RN0,"My wife loved this show, so I bought it for her as a gift.  The price was good, and I got them quickly.  The only issue was that the first discs looked like it was put together by someone recording them off of their VCR.  Those seasons were from the mid-90s, so there's a good chance it was the best quality they had for making the DVDs later.",1455494400,2,343,4.014705882352941
