2727676,5,B000M9BU2Q,"I love this form of exercise, I also ordered the new book Scott wrote and it is wonderful too.  This is such simple form of exercise, done in 30 minutes or so.  I have always considered myself a clutz. not athletic in the least. yet am finding myself picking this up easily and making steady improvement, almost ready to start 3rd level of training.  Before I have never much gone beyond beginners level in all other types of exercise programs.  I am finding my balance, coordination, energy, flexibility improving almost miraculously, without tremendous effort or time. Highly recommend for all ages.",1224288000,27,601,4.920792079207921
2727677,5,B000M9BU2Q,"Until recently, this 2-dvd package was only available as part of the Intu-Flow/Xtension package, for $99, which included a pair of 5 lb. clubbells, a wall chart, and the extra program applying the clubbells as resistance to the Intu-Flow bodyweight exercises. That package is still an awesome deal, as it contains enought material to literally keep one going for a lifetime of joint mobility/connective tissue training, strength work, breathing focus, and mild cardio - as well as a full-blown grounding to the rest of Scott Sonnon's comprehensive body/mind/MA/emotional work system. But these 2 dvd's are a more affordable, easily giftable package that will keep anyone going for some time to come.

I'm familiar with other products and practices from Coach Sonnon. Intu-Flow represents a refinement of previous works (including Warrior Wellness), has 4 levels from total beginner to awesome, and touches on all the above mentioned areas. But its raison d'etre is setting the foundation for all future bodywork, focusing on range of motion and connective tissue retraining - what is commonly referred to as ""joint mobility"" or ""flexibility"" these days, though it's about much more than that. The program works every joint in the body from nape of neck to feet, and the attached capsular, ligament and tendinous attachements, without which further work on strength or cardio or standard stretching tends to lead to imbalances or injury.

You can use Intu-Flow as a warmup, or an AM jumpstart, or a counterbalance to repetitive and restricted daytime work, or self-directed physical therapy to unbind old injuries and calcifications  -- it will do all that.  But in reality, it presents a gradually increasing way of becoming more familiar with your own body, and freeing it up for what it can really do. Tai Chi and yoga can do that, of course, but Intu-Flow is very systematic and immediately doable, starting with simply moving the body. The underlying theory is largely hidden and unobtrusive.

But don't think the program is simplistic - ""sophistication"" of movement is a major theme in Sonnon's work, since ""simple"" doesn't cut it for real life human beings. Even the starting program has elements that carry over immediately to complex tasks - I'm studying various Chinese martial arts, and have experience in several Japanese ones, as well. And the ""beginner"" program has moves in it that made me go ""ah-HAH!"" and made certain movements click immediately in class.

Highly recommended, no matter what your level of interest or ability.",1171152000,60,2542,5.172749391727494
2727678,5,B000M9BU2Q,"So I've been doing Intu-flow for say 3-4 years now, and I'm 59! ...I don't know if I'd call it exercise. It's better than streaching. A lot of people who see me doing it think I'm exercising, and I guess in a way I am, only it's mostly only my joints. I've been seen in airports, on planes, in hotel and dentist lobbies, and at my campsite doing my Intu-flow. I love it. I practice the master level now, with bits of all the other levels thrown in from time to time, should I lapse and want to back off, or concentrate on a particular set of joints. It's so simple, easy, and go-at-your-own-pace; when ever, where ever you want. I wake up almost every morning anymore feeling lose and flexible; not so before Intu-flow.

I truly believe it prolongs, if not reverses, the effects of aging. I got it for my shoulder, having chronic tendon related pain for over a year, even with 8 weeks of prior therapy. I also had lingering pain from a tendon damaged elbow and a knee. All rock climbing and skiing injuries. These days I can't remember half of the time which shoulder, elbow, or knee were the injured ones. After another injury, I developed daily aggravating, increasingly painful, arthritis in my left thumb and pointer finger that persisted a few years before starting Intu-flow. Within just a few months I could flex it more and more, and the pain began to diminished when I did flex it, and now I hardly notice it. I keep doing my Intu-flow!

Before Intu-flow I thought I had good bodily flexibility and range of joint motion, but starting with the beginner routine I found some weaknesses that aren't weaknesses anymore. This head-to-toe inside-to-outside (and that's how you remember the routine) joint mobilization approach is amazing. I tell and show it to all my friends, and everyone, who complains of joint pain, injuries, or just stiffness or lack of flexibility. Every senior center and facility should have it in the daily routine. I re-watch the video, even now, just to tune up my routine. Pay attention to (and re-watch) the introduction that Scott gives, it's the gist of why we do it, and why we get so much benefit from it. I do it every day if I can, and first and always before any strenuous exercise or sport. If I don't do it for a day or two, I miss the tension release and energizing effect I feel afterwards; and for the whole day; for the rest of my life.",1399852800,7,2383,4.501154734411085

2727681,5,B000M9BU2Q,"In a lifetime of fitness that includes martial arts, weight training, yoga, and basically anything else I can get my hands on, IntuFlow stands out as the indispensable daily routine. Once mastered, it only takes 15 minutes and will leave your body feeling like a car that has been warmed up and is ready to drive. It can also help both to prevent injury and heal existing injuries (within reason). Anyone of any fitness level can do IntuFlow and will immediately feel its benefits, though it's really after a month or so that the beauty of it really comes through.

You can try basic IntuFlow for free on YouTube and get a feeling for coach Sonnon's style. Having gone through the full program (basic, intermediate, advanced, master), I find myself doing mostly advanced, with a little intermediate and master mixed in. That's what I enjoy most. You'll be able to find your favorite routine as it's all interchangeable components you can mix and match.

2727682,4,B000M9BU2Q,"Two dvds, the 1st has Intro, Beginner & Intermediate sessions/workout, while the second has the Advanced. Menu divides the main sessions as well as which body part for those sessions. I had issue with at least disc 2 as when I hit menu during the session, I am forced to watch the FBI warning that I cannot FFW through. Production isn't expensive, but done well enough, no issues with lighting or sound. There is only one ""song"" that plays throughout the menu & each session that is very light ethereal style w/some twinkling sounds/taps that always puts me to sleep. It's the perfect tempo & lightness for the end of of massage or put one to sleep, not this & you cannot turn it off. I can hear Scott clearly as he speak & the  camera is mostly facing him, but does have a good amount of close up shots, but only the occasional semi side side (needed much more of those.)
Intro: 2 min
About this dvd, which Scott Sonnon, a martial artist (usadojo.com/biographies/scott-sonnon.htm), has created for his own joint issues as well as his athletes for aches, pains & releasing old tensions that hamper your daily or exercise regimen. How exercise fitness workouts can actually reinforce the aches/pains. He is sitting in an Eastern inspired room for this intro & the principles section.
Principles 10 min (some minor points, he's much more eloquent):
You know your body best & your body lets you know what's going on if you listen. Everyone develops in a universally predictable way such as learning to crawl/walk. Progress must be gradual for it to be permanent. We develop the same way, but each in our own time line, don't compare yourself to others. Start simple, but you must keep going to the complex to avoid plateau & boredom. Address the whole body, not just one joint. Breathing, movement, stretching must be integrative, fear (tension), injuries can get in the way. The actual aches/pains may not be the source of the issue, it could be referred pain from the other side of the body, like a nail snagging a sweater & pulling the thread which is why it's important to do the whole body. Explore the body in both or all directions, move to the tension, not through/force it. Do what you can & get closer & closer to what you can't do, instead of forcing what hurts to do. You must enjoy what you're doing, explore it, enthusiasm, not do it because you have to which increases tension.
Beginner - 30 min
Again, a simple Eastern inspired room, Scott teaches alone except for a male to model the spinal rocking & quad hops. The first 20 min is basic, easy flowing movements to each body area to test tension for those who have no joint/muscle limitation, or to work at for those who do. Almost like warm-up exercises, but much better details & working all joints in all directions. Neck, shoulder rolls, shoulder swings, elbows, wrists, arms, fingers, thorax, pelvic lumbar, spine, hips, knees, ankle joint movements are done. This is all done standing, and it will not raise your heart rate or be a workout in any way. Scott is friendly, to the point while giving great detail in teaching with analogies as he does the movements, making it very quick but never too quick either. The last 10 min asks for some balance like the 4 CBD (4 corner balance drill of holding your leg up in 4 directions), spinal rocking, quad hops (on hands/feet), breathing squats (still standing, not actual squats), lateral arm waves, dropping arm waves & spinal waves (standing), which adds more movement & integrates breathing with the movements, like tai chi or qi gong, but still very easy warm-up joint movements. The only people who will find this a challenge at all are seniors who don't exercise at all or those with significant injuries. Those that exercise even semi-regularly & have no major complaints will move to the next sections.
Intermediate - 34 min
Exactly the same movements as beginner, then adds more movements or goes deeper in the previous ones. Same chapters, same guy models for spinal rocking which turns into a shoulder stand & the quad hops are more circular torso stretching. The leg movements require a little more balance for those who lack, but nothing a chair couldn't fix. I found a tight area in my trapezius that kept me from doing fluid neck rolls, but that's it. Again, most joints are lubricated by these movements in warm-up or during yoga, pilates & dance classes or dvds or martial arts. This is for people who aren't interested in those disciplines or don't exercise or have much at all body awareness.
Advanced - 30 min
Same chapters, but he teaches quicker since you are mostly going over what you've already learned which is mostly flowing movements which many are in figure 8s or infinity symbol movements in horizontal & then lateral planes for all joints & including both sides.  For the 4 CBDs, you will hold the leg straight locking the knee, bent & even yoga dancer's pose & other ways that will require a chair for those who don't have great balance. Spinal rocks is sitting up, rocking back to a yoga plow with legs in more a split, then rocking fwd to a seated wide angle fwd bend. Quad hops just an easy shifting of the body weight over a crouched arm/feet on a floor to each limb in a figure 8. Breathing squats is breathing in/out as your each up & drop to a very low wide squat. Arms waves w/breathing 3x each in/out to get deeper diaphragmatic breath. Spinal waves are a breath focused spinal  slow undulation, one way then the other. This will be a good warm-up even for those will very little or no stiffness or joint mobility.
Master - 20 min
All the same, except now instead of just figure 8s, on some joints you also will be melding the different planes to more a ""clover"" movement to flow to about 6 different points for each joint. Spinal rocking really integrates the breath & adds a shoulder stand & knees to the head before a regular plow to rock out to seated spine stretch & then a seated butterfly. Quad hops are pumping on your hands & feet until you can build a full hop so all hands/feet leave the ground. Breathing squats are going down deep & then stretching up & breathing arm waves are more about breathing out deeply. Spinal waves are a up/down in 1 flow spine undulation with breath focus.

Scott is very friendly & gets to the point in teaching, he even goes a bit fast. I started having trouble following the figure 8s on some & definitely on several of the master class. It really needed side angle since Scott will refer to his left/right, not the user's. This really teaches some good joint movement to really open up one's range of movement more then most basic stretching most got since grade school. For those who already have good body awareness & already stretch & move their joints in ways they feel inspired to by their body that's different from the stretches since high school, they will probably not need this.

2727683,4,B000M9BU2Q,"This is based on yoga principles and the movement structure of Systema an amalgam martial movement structure formed from the methods of the former Soviet bloc.  The combat method is based on being extraordinarily fluid resembling Ba Gua or Tai Chi in some of the movement patterns.  So, for you the viewer you are seeing the 'Tai Chi for Health' esque version of this tradition.  This is presented at levels of complexity that are very easy to do until you aren't watching him, then you start to see the difficulty.

  This is scientific....take the direction of this, move like this, move like this....next chapter we take that and divide the R.O.M. into even finer techniques.  For the legs, there isn't much that's equivalent, he really knows how to present leg movement technique that is unique and very useful.  JUDO-KA, you'll like this stuff because you are familiar with some of it.  Chi gong people, you've seen this but in a different context.  Dancers, I dance quite a bit, this will keep your back-drops and low to floor action fluid and powerful.

  I like his organizational method but it helps to look up BODYWEIGHT EXERCISE REVOLUTION to get the free book that explains the Circular Strength Training parlance and rather brilliant conception of human movement.  It's free!

  I found a discounted Flowfit 1 on Amazon.com months ago and with Steve Maxwell's Joint Mobility deal there I am feeling very frigging strong.  My connective tissue is very resilient right now.  I have been starting messing with a 10k mace and my shoulders wouldn't have been ready without Sonnon's bodyweight methods and my hips wouldn't have been ready without Maxwell's regimes at the end of his dvds.

  Use this like any tool, get what you can out of it.  I think Sonnon is skilled and knows his stuff and he uses his own parlance.  Plus, it helps to understand that he tries to find strength exercises that form circles so force spreads evenly through the body....tensegrity theory...you know like geodesic domes and the like.  He did this because of some bone condition he had, so his methods should be understood from such a context.  Say as opposed to S.Cotter, a wu shu champ focusing on that specialty, P.Tsatsouline, military vet. and competitive lifter focusing on how that translates to general fitness, V. Fedorenko focuses almost entirely with Girevoy Sport and the list goes on.  Sonnon wants elite training to translate to common fitness and long term wellness.

8167379,5,B000M9BU2Q,"Update 12/25/14:
I go on at considerable length in this review about how the knee does not rotate; I just found in Katy Bowman's Move Your DNA an exercise about ""shank rotation"" that might appear to contradict this, but I don't believe it actually does.  See the very bottom of the review--but I recommend reading the whole screed about how there's no rotation, before the part about the exception or apparent contradiction to this statement.  Once you're clear about how the knee does not go around in a circle like the hip, you can understand how the tibia rotates a little on the femur.

Also, btw, what I've found about this program is that while I have no interest in trying to do it every day, memorize it or anything like that, I learned some good stuff from it, have incorporated it into my movement practice, and still consult it from time to time.  A lot of the stuff I can do on the advanced or master's level; certain things I can't really do yet, but I'm working on it.  So although I don't spend, and haven't spent, a whole lot of time with it, I have gotten considerable benefit.  I'm sure that for those who want to do the program every day, that would work too, but it's not the only way to benefit from this.

Original review:

I've been working with this program off and on for a few weeks, and  I think it's great.  I thought at first it was just a set of joint circles like Pavel's Super Joints, or like we do in practically every taiji class, I've ever been in,  but no, it's deeper than that.  There are martial arts movements I've done as a whole, of which the fundamental parts are broken down here, and then there's also an outstanding level of integration, so I find it very helpful.  I'm all mixed up as to what level I'm on; I can do many of the movements at the advanced or even master's level, but there are some I can't do on those levels because of limited flexibility and core strength.  Also, I find that even on the movements I can do well at the high levels, it's beneficial to go back to the beginner or intermediate levels to be more clear on the fundamentals.  That's one of the great things about this program.

Generally, the kind of benefits I expect from this are in the areas of mobility, balance and coordination.  Strength, cardiovascular fitness, not so much; there probably is some degree of strength training at least for the legs.  If you just want one thing to do, that's low-impact and improves mobility, balance, and flexibility to some degree, you could definitely use it that way.  It's also a great complement to your other practices of strength, flexibility and endurance training.  I would say it mosts resembles qigong or taiji forms practice.  Most of the movements are done standing, which I like, but there is a backward roll into shoulder stand, then like a yoga Plough position, and a very interesting thing where you bounce on your hands and knees. There's a lot of dynamic stretching, and training awareness of breathing, and a lot of balancing on one foot.  It goes very well with the same author's Circular Strength Training (clubbells).

Sonnon goes as far in the upper extremity as to have us doing finger circles, which are pleasant, but I'm not sure they're necessary or even especially valuable. However, in the lower extremity, he stops at the ankle.  Of course you're working your foot too, but it isn't addressed.  Well, who thinks to train the feet?  Sonnon probably doesn't need to, as a barefoot martial artist, but you might want to; I would strongly recommend, as a supplement,  that you look into Eric Orton's Born to Run exercises, where you balance on small wobbly things with the help of balance poles, thus developing great strength and mobility in the feet.  That system is intended for runners, but I'm sure it would be valuable for anyone with feet.  Especially people who have practically ruined their feet with a lifetime of wearing shoes and walking on nothing but flat floors and level payments, which is most of us.

Orton's system also includes a set of abdominal exercises using a Swiss ball, so it's a pretty complete system.  Practically everything involves unstable surfaces, and I know there's some controversy about that.  You could probably do most of these ab exercises without the Swiss ball; the foot work depends on the instability, but it's not about balance so much; it's mainly about working out your foot muscles.

I  have a few minor critiques, and one that's kind of serious.

I'm going to go on about this one point at considerable length, so I'll give you the takeaway first, then discuss a couple of other things, and then the long discussion for those who either are interested, or need to be convinced.

The main thing is: DON'T try to ""rotate your knee"".  It's not supposed to do that.  When Sonnon demonstrates ""knee rotation"", the movement he's doing is fine; he calls it knee rotation, but actually he's rotating his hip.  Do what he does, not what he says.  Rotation of the leg is all in the hip, NOT the knee.  It may not be obvious because he's doing it with a bent knee; you can do it first with a straight knee extended in front of you.  In fact, if you have healthy knees, you can demonstrate it very clearly: sit on a stool or the edge of a chair, extend one leg in front of you with heel touching the floor, and try to rotate your knee with your hand.  You'll see that the hip, knee and foot all stay in the same relationship; the rotation is all happening in the hip.  Then if you bend the knee a little and try again, same thing. If your knee does slop around a little when you try to rotate it, that's not good; you really don't want to make it any worse :-|

In the ""knee rotation"" movements, the knee does go in a circle, but that's because it's attached to the hip, which is going in a circle.  When the knee is bent, it's not obvious that the lower leg and foot are also going in circles; it really looks like the knee is circling-- well, it is going around in a circle, but it's not moving relative to the hip.

There is one place, the ""knee"" section intermediate level, where he has you ""rotating"" the knee in various directions, and it would be easy to believe that that's really what's happening.  What actually is happening is that the knee is flexing and extending as the hip rotates.

General issues: the introductory material is OK, I guess, though maybe you could skip it.  I guess you probably want to sit through it once, but once should be plenty.  Just move on to the movements.  I wouldn't dwell on some of the semi-scientific rationale about lubricating your joints or ""washing them with nutrients"".  Actually, it's not so much about getting individual joints moving; it's much more about getting them to move together in a fluid manner.
At first, look, it's very hard to learn movement skills from any video, but I think you can with this one.  However, it will take some time and effort and ""rewinding"" and head-scratching, and then as you progress it may be good to go back to the beginner section to check your form.  I wish there was an inset with a side or rear quarter view; lots of times I'm looking at this guy on the screen, facing me, and I think I can copy the movement if I don't analyze it, but I'm not quite sure.  He's going ""out, in, down, out, up"" and I'm going, ""wait, what?"" and rewinding, and still can't quite figure out if I'm doing the same thing he is, or get quite as clear on the component parts of the movement as I want.  I'm sure this can be overcome with persistence, but a side view would be very helpful.

One complaint I have is that he teaches the movements very well, but doesn't say how many reps or sets you should do, or offer any sample programs.
He says you can do this for 15 minutes, or 5 minutes, whatever you have time for, but there are 20 sections, regardless whatever skill level you're on, and I'm sure each one needs at least a minute, probably some much more.  I guess we just have to figure that out for ourselves.  I suppose that's consistent with the ideals expressed in the introduction.
Still, I wish he had included a section where he just does the movements at normal speed, for a normal amount of reps, so you can follow along without reviewing.
There is a video by Cody Storey on YouTube,
Storey Fitness Basic Mobility Vid, which is pretty much the Intu-Flow movements, so you might try using that.  Storey is evidently a student of Sonnon; he does Tactical Fitness and Clubbell training, both Sonnon products.

It also would be nice if you could hit ""menu"" and get to the main menu instead of the FBI warning, and if the main menu background music wasn't 50dB louder than the instruction; but I guess there are a lof of worse problems it could have.  I really think this is a great program, and generally the DVD production is very good.

OK, here comes the hard part.  You can stop here if not interested in WHY not to rotate your knee.

Sonnon says the rotation of the knee is ""neglected"", and he also says that the elbow ""twists""-- and so does the knee.  No, they don't.  Also, what happens in the arm is very different from what happens in the leg.

When he talked about ""rotation of the elbow"" I was confused at first, because the elbow is a hinge joint; it just flexes and extends, it doesn't rotate.
However, in the case of the elbow, you may think I'm just being pedantic.  What he's referring to is pronation of the forearm, which is a perfectly good physiological movement by any other name.  If you called it ""forearm rotation"" that would really be pretty close.  So that's terminology, and I can't see any harm even if the terminology is incorrect.  However, the arm works one way, the leg another.  You can think you're rotating your elbow, and maybe ""pronating the forearm"" is more correct, but you're not going to get hurt.  Try to actually rotate your knee, and you really could get hurt.

I guess you could build a robot with a ball-and-socket elbow, and the elbow really would rotate, but that's not how ours work.
There are two bones in the forearm, the radius and ulna.  When you turn your palm over (pronation/supination), the radius is rotating around the ulna.  (You can see this for yourself: stick your arm out in front of you with palm up, and then turn the palm down; go back and forth and you can see that the thumb moves much more than the little finger).There is an upper and lower (""proximal"" and ""distal"") joint between radius and ulna; the upper one is just below the elbow, and if you want to include that in a Greater Metropolitan Elbow Area, OK, fine. although most of the rotation happens distal to the elbow (farther away from the body), not actually at or even near the elbow.

In the lower leg, again you have two bones, tibia and fibula, but the fibula doesn't articulate with the knee, and it doesn't move much, just a little to accommodate ankle movement.  It does NOT rotate around  the tibia the way the radius rotates around the ulna.  So when you think you're ""twisting your elbow"" you'll just be pronating the forearm, which is fine; if you try to twist the knee, you'll really twist the knee, and it's not meant to do that.  This is why you're always advised, in walking, running, doing squats or lunges or martial arts movements, to keep the knee pointing the same way as the foot.

When Sonnon demonstrates the movement he calls ""rotating the knee"", look carefully and you'll see that he does not rotate his knee.  It's all in the hip.  (It may be a little hard to see, because he's doing it with the knee flexed).  The knee goes in a circle, sure, but so do the foot and the entire rest of the leg, because they're all connected to the hip, which is the only joint that's actually rotating.  The knee does not move relative to either the femur (thighbone) or the bones of the lower leg.  So, if you just do what he does, not what he says, you'll be fine.

I'll give you another example: when you're doing a ""brush knee twist step"" in tai chi, you step forward on, say, the left foot and shift your weight to it as the right arm comes forward.  Then before you step forward with the right leg, you have to turn your left foot out about 45, but your weight is on it, so how do you do that?  Well, there are three ways: a definitely wrong way, a way I think is dumb, and a good way.
The thing not to do, and you'll see some beginners doing it, is to struggle and effort and try to turn your foot with the weight on it, which is a big strain on your knee, and some people actually have been hurt this way.  So don't do that.

What some people do is, after shifting their weight forward to do the brush knee movement, they then shift their weight all the way back, taking a full beat to do it; turn the foot (by rotating the hip, of course) and then move forward again.  I think that's ridiculous, but it is safe.
The best way to do it, imho, is to take just a little weight off your foot, or simply off the forefoot, thus raising the toes off the floor.  Thus, you can easily pivot on the heel, without straining your knee  This is also called ""distinguishing yin and yang within the foot', since the toes are yin (unweighted) while the heel is still yang (weighted).
See, you can pivot on either the heel or the ball of the foot, even if they're weighted; but you can't pivot on the entire foot at once.

There are lots of sites you can Google about knee and elbow joint movement if you're not convinced.  Bottom line: don't worry about the ""elbow rotation""; it's more properly called pronation and supination of the forearm, but it won't affect how you do the movement.  When it comes to the leg, all rotation in the lower extremity is either in the hip or the ankle, not in the knee.  Don't try to make your knee rotate.  If your knee does rotate a little, my condolences, but don't make it any worse!

I'm not aware of any other serious problems in this DVD, and I really think it's outstanding in all other respects.  Generally you can trust whatever Sonnon says about movement, but on this one point, correction is needed.

Update 12/25/14: I just purchased Move Your DNA by Katy Bowman, and in the ""specifics of walking"" chapter, she has an exercise for ""Shank Rotation"", and she says ""While we typically think of the knee as something that bends or straightens, it also rotates.  There isn't a great quantity of motion here, but it is a mobility that helps the knee keep well"".

This sounds like the opposite of what I've been saying, but not really.  Full disclosure: what she said, I never thought about it or knew about it before; this is an entirely new concept for me, and I think she's probably right.  I'm trying the exercise, and it's difficult to tell whether the lower leg is actually rotating, or the ankle, but for now I'm just going to take her word for it, that there is a small amount of rotation of the lower leg on the knee.

However, this is not what I've been arguing against, and I'm pretty sure it's not what Sonon meant either.  The knee does NOT rotate in a circle like the hip or ankle, OK? That's what I've been on about.

She's saying something quite different: that the leg lower rotates a little around its long axis; not in a circle, just back and forth a little.  The exercise you do to improve this rotation is quite different from anything in the Sonon DVD.  If you imagine a cylinder rotating around its long axis, the far end doesn't move any more than the near end; whereas, when you rotate your hip, a small movement in the hip translates to a much bigger movement of the foot; it's sweeping out a cone rather than a cylinder.",1409616000,4,15631,4.425874125874126
8167380,4,B000M9BU2Q,"I bought this DVD because I like the exercises from Scott Sonnon. I wanted a DVD that I could use when I had less time and only wanted to concentrate on specific body parts. The DVD needs to be better programmed. as per other comments by other users the copyright info comes up way too often. I still like his other DVD better, but it is over 75 minutes long and I haven't been able to finish the whole thing at one time. the exercises are great for flexibility.",1402012800,,462,4.202247191011236
8167381,5,B000M9BU2Q,"the exercise I have waited for that makes perfect sense. Wish I had heard
of it much sooner.
If I could wish for one little thing it would be to have the demonstration
a little bit slower. It still works when stopping it and rerunning it.
Thank you Mr. Scott Sonnon",1401062400,,265,4.215686274509804
