If you can't sleep and you have to go to work in the morning, put this thing on. Half the action is people sitting around a table talking in the dark, Many of them are miscast. There is a  general there  who weighs 350 pounds with a beard.  Also the other half of the action is in the house with Santa sitting in the dark mostly, acting well just wimpy and  insane. Not good bad, but bad bad. Even the DVD cover is bad.",1438905600,,542,4.114285714285714
8479993,1,B005MX7FA8,"This movie is just plain unwatchable in every possible way.  For starters the chief focal point characters are this dull and very cliche' family featuring a geeky father who looks like a 1970's college professor, his ugly and super-nerdy daughter, his sexy supermodel looking wife, and his beautiful other daughter.  All they're doing is getting things set up for their holiday together, while some heated discussions come about and also they meet the beautiful older daughters boyfriend.

While they hire a guy who works as Santa Claus and 3 elves(only one of which is a real elf) for their party, a zombie outbreak comes from who-knows-where and the president and his Pentagon men have several discussions and arguments over what exact course of action needs to be carried out.  At first they drop some bombs(never allowing the audience to know exactly how much damage was done or who all died) but the president soon puts a stop to that.

At no time does this movie ever prove interesting much less well-acted.  The scenes with the president and the military men not only went on forever but, there were far too many of those scenes.  To make matters worse, other than the three zombies that you see previously, the major horde of zombies is never shown until 92 minutes into the movie.  What soon followed with that was a teacher appearing to have pink spray paint on him and the Santa actor and his 3 elves playing an instrumental Christmas CD while getting them to sit on his lap while the music mellows the zombies out.  That scene couldn't possibly be any more stupid if it tried!  The nerdy daughter just gets more annoying as the movie continues.  The fight choreography just couldn't possibly be more fake looking or embarrasingly moronic bar none.

Overall this movie is extremely boring,  very slow-paced, the scenes with the president and the soldiers were way too boring and plodding,  the script is just juvenile,  the acting is painfully dreadful,  this movie's running time is an unacceptible and far too long 99 minutes,  some of the same actors were used and proved much worse in their other roles, if that's even popssible, the characters are extremely dull cliche's, and worst of all the zombie took a backseat to the point of almost non-existent.  Weren't they supposed to be the thing to hook people into wanting to see this movie next to the possibility of a fun camp-filled laugh? This sad pos movie is a definite must skip.",1418860800,,2450,4.779097387173397

But why would you want it?

This is not a horror film, but an unfunny comedy. There are two main sets -- a HOUSE with a family trapped by the zombies outside. And the BASEMENT OFFICE of the U.S. President and his staff and military.

At least half this film is set in the basement offices. And those scenes are mostly talking ... and talking, and talking, and talking ... about the zombie apocalypse outside. Planing, and talking, and assessing the situation, and talking. Boring!

In some ways, the filmmaker didn't even TRY to create a sense of realism. There's only one general, and several ""elite"" special forces troops. These elite troops have cool uniforms and special forces red berets -- but some have GOATEES or FULL BEARDS. One has a long PONYTAIL. And they're out of shape. One of them is quite ... FAT.

The general is grossly overweight, but that can pass. But even he has a goatee.

Look, I can understand the filmmaker wanting to cast his fat friends instead of casting in-shape actors who actually look like special ops troops. But please make an effort. Give these actors military crew cuts and shave their faces.

It seems like a small matter, yet it's telling. It indicates that the filmmaker and friends didn't take this film seriously. The actors may have wanted the parts, but not to the extent of shaving or cutting their hair (it would take a while to grow it back so long). And the filmmaker accepted it instead of insisting on a military look for his military characters.

The entire film is low-budget and amateurish, and the above indicates why. It's not just lack of talent or money, but lack of artistic commitment.

No, it doesn't matter that this film is supposed to be a comedy. Even comedies require commitment to the story and characters.

Apart from that, this is a tale of a family trapped in their house by zombies. We then crosscut to the president's basement office as he yaks, yaks, yaks with his corpulent general. (Oh yeah, there's an attempted coup, which is not very interesting.) Eventually the president's staff makes radio contact with the family and attempts a rescue.

The Santa angle is not played up. Basically, this mall Santa thinks he might be the real thing, but that's only a small part of the film, and it goes nowhere. Nor the elf who thinks he might be real. It's just some more (boring) yak, yak, yak as they ponder these possibilities.",1363651200,2,2650,4.945945945945946
