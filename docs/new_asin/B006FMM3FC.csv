4985178,3,B006FMM3FC,"I'm old enough to have heard the series on radio, though they probably weren't first run. I liked The Shadow radio program a lot, but the movie not so much. This Lamont Cranston is a little too powerless and carries the wrong gun. Still it's fun to see the way these stories used to be told in the movies and compare them to the movie storytelling of today. Mercifully short, it's a watch-it-by-yourself movie because if you have someone else in the room you'll probably decide to do something better with your time.",1464998400,,516,4.559139784946237
4985179,4,B006FMM3FC,"Very enjoyable old B&W movie.  There was a stretch about half way through where the video quality dropped substantially for several minutes, but then recovered.  I suspect it's because at least two copies of the film were spliced together due to a damaged section in one of them.  Audio quality was very good.",1464739200,,309,4.7924528301886795

4985183,4,B006FMM3FC,"I'm a big fan of the classic radio drama of The Shadow as well as the books and short stories in the series. This movie was enjoyable even though it was a very light hearted, almost comical take on the character. It completely abandoned the mystical overtones of the original subject matter but I guess the producers were trying to compete with the other popular detective series of the time such as Charlie Chan or The Falcon. If you want to see a Shadow movie truer to the original I would recommend the 1994 Alec Baldwin version.",1463529600,,532,4.494845360824742

But the dvd copy from Nostalgia Family is lacking . The video is ok with the exception of a few glitches but the audio is another thing . About twenty minutes into a 60 minute film you start to get audio dropouts which continue off and on through the last half of the film . Very frustrating .",1461628800,,435,4.011494252873563

4985224,1,B006FMM3FC,This tried far to hard to be something it was not. The character use was poor and all the time I felt like it wanted to be either the Thin Man or Charlie Chan.  This needed to stay as a radio show program.,1409616000,,205,3.7674418604651163

It doesn't compare to the best (The Thin Man and The Maltese Falcon, for example), as far as acting, plot or dialog, so I'll only give it 3 stars, but if you like this sort of film, you'll enjoy this one. It's a murder mystery with The Shadow, his fiancee and his taxi driver helping the wise old police chief and the bumbling police inspector. Plenty of laughs.",1408406400,2,397,4.378378378378378

4985234,2,B006FMM3FC,"Sherlock Holmes,  Dick Tracy, Nick Charles (The Thin Man) and Simon Templar (The Saint) all started their dective lives on paper then radio and eventually the movies. Some  of these movies became classics : Nick and Nora fighting the bad guys. Holes and Watson foiling Moriaritys plans (hey, Robert Downy- stick to Iron Man movies). The Saints tounge-in-cheek humor and smoothness with the ladies (a possible template for a future James Bond).
And now we come to Lamont Cranston. The Shadow was a staple among fans of radio mysteries. The dark almost menacing voice appealed to young and old alike. As for this film adaptation I find it a disgrace to the genre.
The layout of most of these stories were the same: A murder and or robbery. A wronged suspect, a gunfight, a fistfight. A quick car chase. A sudden plot twist amd Voila the mystery is solved.
The story hes is so poor you cheer for the dead guy. At least he doesn't have to waddle through anothe hour of this poorly written drek.
The acting, though hammy at times, is barely passable.
My biggest complaint is the fact that the film has NOT been retored to it's original format. Scenes come and go without transition. Dialogue gets cut right in the middle of speech. The film copy is grainy and dark in some spots.
HEY AMAZON! CHECK YOUR STOCK. At least VUDU and Netflix warn you about bad copies. If you want to see good copies of old movies check out the listings for Turner Classic Movies.
I give this movie two stars: a B for effort and a D for achievement.",1397347200,,1521,4.527272727272727

The whole point of the series which glued children to their radios in its heyday was that Lamont Cranston, a man about town, had learned in the Orient the trick of clouding mens minds so that they could not see him. His invisibility was what gave him special powers. This Lamont Cranston becomes the Shadow by putting on a black coat, hat and mask. There is no indication whatsoever of how or why this gives him special powers, yet in that outfit he is able to fight men much larger than himself and win without mussing his hair. As for story, what story? People run around a cemetery, an old mansion, and a warehouse, while Cranstons chauffeur  he takes Cranston and his girlfriend around in an old taxi  acts the part of Jack Bennys Rochester in whiteface.
