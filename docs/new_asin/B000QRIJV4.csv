8196984,5,B000QRIJV4,This video shows a level of corruption I had not realized existed then...... So Disappointing to see how this man & his family were treated and then the government pout right lied to cover their tracks...lied on several points in fact. They shot the Kids dog with our provocation & shot the boy in the back. See it for yourself and show it to your children so they know what they are facing in their futures....,1521331200,,411,4.421052631578948

8196986,4,B000QRIJV4,"I never cease to be amazed at how little the average American knows of the treachery of the U.S. Government. Ruby Ridge was a rallying point for the American Anti-Government Extremist Movement, and they were JUSTIFIED. The saga of Randy Weaver was a tragic event in American history because our government murdered a woman and child, (The woman was holding her infant when the FBI sniper shot her in the head) and nobody but the victims were punished! I use this video in classes that I teach in Criminal Justice. The video does a good objective job of describing what happened, but it fails to take a position and in that regard it does a disservice. Members of the FBI lied and should have been punished and every effort should have been made by the Government, Media and the Public to achieve that end. Instead, the FBI got away with Murder.",1372550400,4,844,4.596026490066225
