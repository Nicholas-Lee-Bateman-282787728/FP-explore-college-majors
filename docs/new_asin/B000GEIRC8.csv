2605950,5,B000GEIRC8,"I love exercising with Michelle Dozois - she cues well, her workouts are always fun and I never check the time, even when she makes me work hard.

Time really flies with Pick Your Level, a circuit workout with plenty of variety (cardio, upper body work with weights, lots of squats and lunges, torso rotations, ab work on the mat and some lovely yoga-inspired strength work and stretches). The three different levels make this workout even more interesting; and because Michelle cues so well, you can move between levels depending on how you're feeling and whether you want to make it a tougher or lighter workout. Another plus is that the DVD is chaptered, so it's easy to skip a circuit or two if you want a shorter workout.

I would strongly recommend this DVD for beginners and people returning to exercise. There is so much room to grow with this workout. More advanced exercisers may find some parts a little easy, especially the cardio segments (although you can increase your heart rate by skipping the base moves and you can also use heavier weights). And when you're ready to move on, Michelle's Your Best Body Circuit is a great choice.",1206662400,15,1147,4.701492537313433
2605951,5,B000GEIRC8,"I own another of Michelle's workouts - 10 Minute Cardio Solution.  She is upbeat without being annoying and doesn't take a whole lot of time explaining each movement.  They are simple enough to follow.  I like that you can challenge yourself depending on your mood and energy level of the day.  I stick with level 2 most of the time but jump up to level 3 for the cardio segments.

In general, I enjoy Michelle's personality and that you can customize your workout. I get bored very easily so this DVD is perfect for those who need stimulation and challenge.",1197417600,2,558,4.54
2605952,5,B000GEIRC8,"This is the best workout video I've seen.  Michelle gives clear instructions, has excellent cueing, explains how to get good form, focuses on making each exercise safe, and has perfect pacing.  The three levels of exercises and the ability to pick and choose which level of each exercise you want to do truly makes this a video appropriate for any fitness level.  The workout is thorough: strength training, cardio, balance, and flexibility are all addressed.  For those with bad joints, it's completely feasible to do this as a strictly low-impact workout and still be challenged as much as you like.  I'd recommend this workout to anyone.",1191024000,6,640,5.0
2605953,5,B000GEIRC8,"This is one of the best fitness videos that I've ever seen, it has 3 diffrent difficult levels in all the excercises that  Michelle presents; the hardest level is really hard, you feel that you're really burning calories. She is an excelent trainer, explains everything in a very easy way. Excelent!!!",1178928000,2,301,4.901960784313726
2605954,4,B000GEIRC8,"Stated in the intro, I kept the suggestion in my mind that one doesn't have to stay at one level throughout the workout. That really helps and motivated me. Favorite move: single leg touchdown.  The production is very good-the music, camera angles, the set with platform levels, the split screen and visual reminders.",1169942400,3,317,4.981132075471698
2605955,5,B000GEIRC8,This program is very thorough.  I love Michelle anyway and she does not disappoint me with this DVD.  The moves are not difficult and the choices are endless since you can mix and match moves because there are 3 levels to choose from.,1168473600,3,234,4.4186046511627906
2605956,5,B000GEIRC8,I love Michelle Dozois and she is excellent in this video.  I often pair it with a short 20 or 30 minute cardio video for a great all-around workout.  Thumbs up!,1164326400,3,161,4.161290322580645
2605957,4,B000GEIRC8,"I've seen this instructor (Michelle Dozois) in other dvds (Prevention and Crunch) and I knew she'd be good in this too because she's always outgoing and knows her stuff.  Here she is no different.  Still upbeat and motivating.

This workout uses light cardio with weighted intervals.  This is the best way to burn fat and calories.  They show three different levels of moves so no matter what your fitness level is, you can keep up or challenge yourself.  To show you the different levels, they sometimes show the other participants either in a split screen or side by side.  Either way, you get to always see what someone else is doing and choose what you are comfortable with which I like.  You will need to have weights for this and you will feel like you've done some good for yourself after this.  It's a good workout.",1154217600,12,823,4.582191780821918
2605958,5,B000GEIRC8,"I rented this dvd from the local library and just had to buy it.  This exercize is the best. Michelle breaks them down do different levels. You can make it really sweaty or work at an easy pace. The weighted parts are really new and inventive, not just plain squats or curls for Michelle.  I even sub some of these ideas into my other work-out dvds.  This is her best ever.",1289174400,,373,4.225352112676056
2605959,5,B000GEIRC8,"Pick your level is an exellent workout dvd. There are 3 levels with level 1 being for beginners, level 2 intermediate and level 3 advanced. I personally found level 1 too easy, therefore did alot of level 2 and 3.
The workout involves a warm up followed by 4 circuits and a cool down.
Each workout uses weights depending on the level chosen, and includes some cardio,sculpt and ab work.
During this workout I wore a heart monitor and burned 174 calories,42% being fat.
The duration is 44 minutes. Be ready to feel sore the next day. This workout really works.",1251676800,,559,4.544554455445544
2605960,5,B000GEIRC8,"This is a great workout where you can choose to watch either the level 1 person, the level 2 person, or the level 3 person. So whether you're a beginner, an intermediate, or an advanced, there is a workout here for you!

Although, if you have a Netflix account, go there to watch it! They have it available for Instant Watch. =D So no need to pay Amazon to watch the thing.",1248220800,,373,4.180555555555555
2605961,5,B000GEIRC8,"I don't like some of Michelle's other workouts, but this one is very well done. Just the right pace with lots of options to match your fitness level, just follow the exerciser that suits you best. It is a varied cardio & weights routine that is surprisingly good.",1248048000,,263,4.5
2605962,5,B000GEIRC8,"Because you can change up your workout every time, this video is never boring. I highly recommend!",1241136000,,98,4.823529411764706
2605963,4,B000GEIRC8,"This  44 minute workout is similar to Prevention's ""Walk Your Way Slim"" because of the levels of intensities.  In this workout you are afforded the ability to work at a beginner, intermediate or advanced level.  Most workouts don't have this ability and you have to either modify or intensify.  This workout is also similar to Anni Mairs ""Core Force"" or ""Life Force"" due to using light weights and having cardio segments intermixed.

Michelle Dozois does an excellent job cueing.  Not only does she tell you what is coming next, she also reminds you to use proper form and which weights to pick up for each circuit.  The camera angles are always good to view each level exerciser.

""Fat To Firm"" consists of four short circuit workouts.  The circuits make the most of every minute by using multi-muscle group exercises, targeted toning and easy to follow mini cardio segments.  The use of light weights 3-10 pounds is required for maximum benefits of this workout.

This DVD is chaptered so you can pick any segment you want from warm up to cool down.  Or just play the whole workout.
This workout is quite enjoyable and tough at the same time.  It is a very efficient workout.  I like that you can get upper body, lower body, core and cardio all done in 44 minutes.  The time goes by quickly without any dread factor.  Michelle has a very friendly demeanor which encourages you to stick with it and do some advanced level moves.",1239062400,6,1429,4.656
2605964,4,B000GEIRC8,I'm just getting back to exercise and this is a great workout for the total body with cardio.  I like the 3 levels you can pick from and I do alternate between the three of them.  I highly recommend.,1233964800,,199,4.076923076923077
2605965,4,B000GEIRC8,"I love to lift weights and not really a big cardio fan, I was looking for a dvd that offered toning without an incredibly long cardio section that would leave me frustrated when I lost step/cadence.  This is great, the cardio sections are intermittent, so you don't feel winded the whole time.  I personally never did any moves on the beginner level, I stayed at the intermediate and on a few opted for the advanced.  I feel this would be great for people of any level of fitness.  This video is up to date and lively as well.",1220227200,,526,4.336734693877551
2605966,4,B000GEIRC8,"Just purchased this yesterday, really liked this dvd.  Instructor is very good on cueing with lots of details.  I love the fact that you can pick your own level and combine levels.  I used to be a very devoted exerciser/trainer.  Over the years I've let myself go, busy, injuries, etc.  I was able to combine levels 1 and 2 and complete the workout, work up a good sweat and get good a muscle workout.  I can see using this workout at least once a week along with my other workouts (I get bored easily).  The integration of cardio bursts were a nice surprise and the 44 minutes flew by.  The only reason I did not give this a 4 star is because of my shoulder injury and could not do plank position exercises, but otherwise I see this as a great overall workout, cardio and resistance.  Definitely a buy!",1214438400,,803,4.3355704697986575
2605967,5,B000GEIRC8,I absolutely love workouts that I can grow with as I get stronger.  This one fits the bill.  It's great!,1212451200,,104,4.15
8131081,4,B000GEIRC8,"I actually ordered this to replace the old copy I had for almost 10 years!  I like this workout a lot.  It's great for when you have slacked for too long and are just getting back into working out.  There are 3 people doing 3 different variations of the same movement, so you can follow whichever one you feel the most comfortable with.  There aren't too many reps of each movement before moving on to the next one, so it goes quickly and you never feel like you're going to die.  It's broken up into 4 circuits, a warm up and a cool down.  You really feel it in all the right places afterwards.  The music is a little cheesy and dated, but the instructions are clear.  I'd recommend this!",1490140800,,689,4.246153846153846
8131082,5,B000GEIRC8,Love this. Easy to follow. Good workout.,1462492800,,40,4.857142857142857
8131083,1,B000GEIRC8,Too many dance like moves. Very complicated stepping. Wasn't fun. Tired of trying to follow it. Sits in my closet and I'm sorry I got it.,1459987200,,137,4.3076923076923075
8131084,5,B000GEIRC8,"This is a truly  First Rate Full Body Workout. It's primarily  geared to  intermediate level exercisers. It's an interval workout (it alternates cardio and toning episodes for maximum effect).
What makes this outstanding is that Dozois manages to cover all body parts within 30 minutes and does so without boring us. Moves change frequently. She doesn't build up long complex routines (a staple in exercise vids - which you may or may not like.)
MUSIC & PRODUCTION VALUES: The music is standard issue, not terribly motivating, but not nearly as annoying or repetitive as some. Production values pretty average, with occasional moments where you can't see something that should be visible.

LEVELS:  Many/Most? beginners could probably do this, but a few real beginners might have difficulty following Michelle if they've never done video exercise before. Dozois's cuing is fine but cramming 3 versions of everything in leaves little time for repeat which might be awkward for video newbies. They might want to start with ""Fat Burning for Dummies"" which is actually a pretty decent beginner aerobic workout that leads you more slowly following. In contrast
I don't think Advanced exercisers would be challenged enough by this. They might enjoy it from time to time for variation from their usual routine but I don't see them doing it daily.
SUMMARY: I think this would be an excellent choice for advanced beginners through intermediate level exercisers.",1437696000,2,1452,5.188034188034188
8131085,4,B000GEIRC8,"I like exercising to this. It is not too difficult but keeps this 80-something gal moving.
I have to avoid strenuous exercise. That makes this one just right.",1393804800,,158,4.678571428571429
8131086,5,B000GEIRC8,I did this workout yesterday and i am sore today..thats a good thing...a couple of months ago i started with the biggest loser and did that for a month but never got sore then i started the firm transfirmation series which i love but still didn't get as sore as this i have to add that the day before i did this workout i did the pick your level weight loss pilates which is also awesome..i did a mix of all three levels on both..mainly 2 and 3...buy it..you won't be dissapointed,1380412800,,480,4.228260869565218
8131087,5,B000GEIRC8,I have also ordered Pick Your Level Pilates and have high hopes that between the two I'll get into much better shape!,1355184000,,117,4.363636363636363
8131088,5,B000GEIRC8,"I borrowed this workout video from my library before I purchased it so I knew what I was getting.
You have a choice of 3 difficulty levels with each workout.  This is one of my favortie go-to video when I need to workout at home.",1344211200,,229,4.088888888888889
8131089,5,B000GEIRC8,"I am a HUGE fan of all of the PICK YOUR LEVEL VIDEOS because you can really grow with them. This one is original and fun! Not the same old choreography that everyone uses...I love this one! I also tend to like videos that have eye popping colors on the set, weird but true, I am more drawn to pick them to use! For some reason it makes doing the video more pleasant! Ya need to take advantage of the used copies that you can get on Amazon that are like a couple of dollars. I order used DVD's all of the time now! I have over 200 in my library and I learned that if it plays well, who cares who used it before! I have never had any problems except once and the company sent me another one right away, actually he sent me several for free!!! GET THIS DVD, its awesome for any level!!!",1335484800,,783,3.9936305732484074
