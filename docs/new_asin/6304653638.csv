PERIOD! I've watched this video many, many times, and I tell you, it's still as interesting to watch as the first time. Hearing Davy, Mike, Peter and Micky talk about Jimi Hendrix, the making of ""Head"", the many musical performances of ""Daydream Believer"", ""No Time"", ""Randy Scouse Git"", etc. make this a must for any Monkees fan or even potential Monkees fan. And just as the credits come to an end... the viewer is rewarded with an extra 20 minutes or so of interviews.",1088899200,3,643,4.649122807017544
7876739,5,6304653638,"A great documentary that relives the Monkees story until 1997. The video isn't narrated. Instead, bits and pieces of interviews from several key players are strung togeter to tell the Monkee story. These ""key players"" include ALL FOUR of the Monkees, Don Kirshner, Ward Sylvester, and many others. One interesting facet of presenting the Monkees story in this way is that each of the Monkees' interpretation of what the Monkees were is a little different from the other. Also, many videos and clips from the show are included.
But WAIT....the BEST part of this video is the langinappe at the end of the tape. (Langiappe [lon-yop] is a Cajun word that means a ""little something extra."") Once the credits have rolled, those who waited are ""rewarded"" with some great interviews by each Monkee. (Don't you just LOVE Rhino!) It was like finding $ in my coat pocket!!
Davy tells the ""salad story"" that breaks the ice between the four of them. Mike recalls a great Monkeemania moment--the guys being chased by the masses at a Cincinnati concernt. Micky's story involves being discovered in a London park early one morning by pre-teen girls the night after the Beetles through them a party. Peter talks about Jimmy Hendrix opening up for their 1967 tour. There is also the infamous story about Mike punching his fist through the wall, which is relived by Mike, Micky, Davy, and Don Kirshner himself. (Just to be clear--each relived the story in SEPARATE interviews. They were not all in the same room!!) There are a few other interviews as well.
Many of the interviews are several minutes long, with lots of emotion and detail. I particularly like Mike's, simply because interviews with him are few and far between.
I hate to spoil the surprise at the end of the tape, but I don't want anyone to miss it!!! I noticed the other reviews didn't mention it. I'm wondering how many other people out there who own the tape missed it.",1026172800,15,1919,4.7657657657657655
7876740,5,6304653638,"An amazing conglomeration of all things Monkee.  A knock-me-to the floor live performance of Listen to the Band and Mike singing, all on his own.  What more could any real Monkee fan ask for?  A video worth owning if not for the information, at least for the music, in its entirety, throughout the course of the film.",1017792000,6,317,4.526315789473684
