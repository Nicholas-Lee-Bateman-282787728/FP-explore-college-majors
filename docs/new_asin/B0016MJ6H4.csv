3159770,1,B0016MJ6H4,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The protagonist is supposed to turn into a werewolf after receiving eyes transplanted from a wolf. You see, in the beginning of the movie our stalwart hero is blinded rescuing a co-worker. However, the werewolf never materializes.

  For a horror movie, it makes a great comedy. The plot and action are ridiculous. For about 20 minutes of the movie we see our hero running through the woods bare chested with a pack of wolves. I would rather have watched the incredibly talented and beautiful heroine in the movie, Tinsel Korey, running through the woods bare chested.

  Please do not waste your time and money on this absolute bore. It is almost as exciting as a speech by Barack Obama.",1281916800,,745,4.606060606060606
3159771,2,B0016MJ6H4,"This movie started off on the right foot, with the whole eye transplant aspect. It had all the ingredients needed, but somewhere along the line, it's like the director decided to make an entirely different movie! Where are the WEREWOLVES?! I kept sitting there waiting for the lycan aspect to kick in and... NATHIN' . Oh well, I'll just pop my copy of Dog Soldiers in my DVD player ... now THAT'S a werewolf movie!",1236556800,,414,4.533333333333333
3159772,1,B0016MJ6H4,This should have been called 'Spot the Werewolf & win a prize' A Werewolf movie with no Werewolf. A lousy script. Justine Bateman was the only decent thing about it. If you see this DVD on the shelf - turn & walk quickly away.,1229644800,,226,4.159090909090909
3159773,5,B0016MJ6H4,"Ok I must be upfront about the fact I love movies about werewolves and real wolves too so I claim my bias up front.  That said this is a pretty good movie.  Not particularly horror however.  There are some gore scenes but nothing horrid to make you come close to gacking up the turkey on toast with mayo you just ate.  The plot is sort of one dimensional and predictable.  The evil military government people get wind of a man who via fantastic surgery gets a wolf's eyes.  Getting the wolf's eyes came with a hidden price however.  Darn you guessed it right.  Over time the recipiant of the wolf's eyes starts noticing development of other wolfe like skills and a sense of family with wolves and even wild dogs.

There are no werewolf transformation scenes.  This movie made itself novel by creating a werewolf by implication.  The man became a werewolf in skills, abilities, drives and instincts while retaining a human form.  While ok I would not consider the star of the movie a ""Pretty Man"" which only added to the coolness of the picture.  There is a weak sex scene in the movie for those of you that require such a thing.  Being autistic I can live without sex scenes in my movies completely.

I liked that in his wild or feral mentality he never killed a innocent.  While difficult he always kept a shread of his humanity and dignity.  He did kill doctors and members of the sick twisted research facility and they did deserve to die.  The coolest thing of all and what for me makes this movie a keeper is the ending.  The ending of this movie is so nice it moves to the A LIST of my entire collection not just the best of the werewolf themed movies.

Personally I had to give this movie 5 stars because, it satisfied all my desires in a manner few others have.",1225324800,21,1769,4.384615384615385
3159774,4,B0016MJ6H4,"This is the latest release in the 'Man-Eaters' series, this time around about a werewolf. When I first heard about this flick, I joked to my girlfriend that its probably about 'energy efficient werewolves.' Oh how right I was. See, the main plot revolves around an evil medical corporation that implants a wolf's eyes into a blind man, inadvertently turning him into a werewolf. Well, sort of. He just kind of runs around at night with a pack of wolves (or in one case, feral dogs). Naturally, he runs away, with the military-industrial complex chasing after him. During the course of this, he falls in love with a Native American woman and undergoes a 'spiritual quest' to make peace with the wolf-half of himself.

Yeah, theres more than a little New Age-y spiritualism going on in there. But that said, its not a bad movie really. They actually hired Native American actors, for one, and had real wolves. And, unlike other movies, they didn't portray the wolves as especially evil or anything. The main thrust of this movie really seems to be man vs. nature, and while it wasn't especially scary or gorey as far as werewolf movies go, it at least was able to keep my interest. It also features Justine Bateman, who does a great job as the head of the hospital, trying to get our protagonist back. Its probably not the high point for the Man-Eater movies, but its still worth watching.",1216684800,8,1387,4.661224489795918
3159775,4,B0016MJ6H4,"I came across the DVD in a horror shop.  Decided to take a chance...didn't know what to expect, but to my surprise...it was great.  It's similar to ""Wolf"" with Jack Nicholson where it covers more a of spiritual journey of the lead character rather than an overwhelming need to kill humans.  Some of the supporting characters aren't very good, but the lead does a great job embracing the wolf energy inside of him.  The footage of the wolves is great and there are some very nice montages with the lead character connecting with the wolf energy.  If you're a werewolf fan...I think it's a must!  Overall, I think the director did a great job!",1215993600,11,641,4.578947368421052

3159828,4,B0016MJ6H4,I love the premiss of this movie.

3159873,1,B0016MJ6H4,"When you watch enough horror movies, it starts to become a bit of Six Degrees of Syfy Bacon. I watched, in order:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skeleton-Man/dp/B000BCKFHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skeleton Man</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bone-Eater/dp/B0017XH77S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bone Eater</a>, and Monster Wolf. Surely, I thought, if I closed my eyes and just picked a movie at random from my overstuffed Tivo list I would find a film that had nothing to do with white people getting in touch with their Native American spiritual side. I should have kept my eyes closed.

Hybrid is obviously inspired by the shirtless spate of werewolves now common to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B001SGEUHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>. But unlike the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B001SGEUHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>&nbsp;series, or say, any other movie that involves werewolves, Hybrid has no special effects to speak of. But what it lacks in special effects, it makes up for with grainy stock footage of wolves. Seriously, fifty percent of this movie is just pictures of wolves biting, snarling, playing, and running. Sometimes they kill a buffalo.

Theoretically, this is a science fiction film about ""cross-species organ transplants."" When one scientist dares to challenge the logic of how this could possibly work, the response is ""of course such a thing is impossible, which is why it works!"" See what they did there? Clever, huh?

Our hero Aaron Scates (Corey Monteith) is the transplant recipient, and it's not long before he begins having wolf visions and wolf instincts, because it makes perfect sense that wolf eyes make you lupine. In between eating raw steaks and not wearing a shirt, Scates encounters museum curator Lydia Armstrong (Tinsel Korey), who recognizes the eyes of the wolf she once tried to help. Armstrong isn't very good at helping anybody, wolf or man, and it's not long before Scates is on the run again.

A Special Forces team is tasked with hunting Scates down so that he may be properly exploited for scientific and military purposes. They needn't have bothered - Scates only hops around, growls, pants (yes, there is actually the sound of a dog panting when Scates runs through the forest), and occasionally shows up with blood on his chest.

Actors scream in terror to help make up for the fact that there's nothing scary about Scates whatsoever, other actors try to pretend they care about capturing Scates, and wolves flash on the screen for minutes at a time. The ending is stultifying lame, with a record ""fade out"" exit of a main character. That's right, he fades out of the scene.

This movie is a real dog. Actually, it's worse than that. It's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mountain-Three-Wolf-Moon-Shirt/dp/B002HJ377A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Shirt</a>&nbsp;of werewolf movies.",1287014400,,3135,6.228637413394919
3159874,5,B0016MJ6H4,Surprisingly well made despite never even being heard of by me or my sci-fi friends. There is no actual werewolf or wolfman in it but it is more like a combination of Dark Angel with Jessica Alba and any werewolf movie. Genetic experimentation gone wrong(or very right?).

3159875,5,B0016MJ6H4,"This movie has been marketed as a horror movie in the Maneater series, with plenty of blood and guts and gore, and that is not what this movie is about at all.  If you bought this thinking that is what you would get, then you will be sorely disappointed.  The gore scenes are extremely tame, particularly for this genre, and the acting seems a bit forced and the plot somewhat two-dimensional.  However, what this movie does do is that it paints the picture of wolves (and werewolves) not as mindless killers but as beings who live in harmony with their environment, and that humans play an essential part in that environment.  It brings forth the Native American message that wolves and humans are brothers, just as we are brothers to all living things, and that is a message that is unfortunately very much missing in modern mainstream cinema, especially in the horror genre.  I wouldn't call it a horror movie and I wouldn't call it New Age-y, but what it does do is to illustrate some important Native American wisdom.

Surely, I thought, if I closed my eyes and just picked a movie at random from my overstuffed Tivo list I would find a film that had nothing to do with white people getting in touch with their Native American spiritual side. I should have kept my eyes closed.

Hybrid is obviously inspired by the shirtless spate of werewolves now common to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B001SGEUHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>. But unlike the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B001SGEUHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>&nbsp;series, or say, any other movie that involves werewolves, Hybrid has no special effects to speak of. But what it lacks in special effects, it makes up for with grainy stock footage of wolves. Seriously, fifty percent of this movie is just pictures of wolves biting, snarling, playing, and running. Sometimes they kill a buffalo.

Theoretically, this is a science fiction film about ""cross-species organ transplants."" When one scientist dares to challenge the logic of how this could possibly work, the response is ""of course such a thing is impossible, which is why it works!"" See what they did there? Clever, huh?

Our hero Aaron Scates (Corey Monteith) is the transplant recipient, and it's not long before he begins having wolf visions and wolf instincts, because it makes perfect sense that wolf eyes make you lupine. In between eating raw steaks and not wearing a shirt, Scates encounters museum curator Lydia Armstrong (Tinsel Korey), who recognizes the eyes of the wolf she once tried to help. Armstrong isn't very good at helping anybody, wolf or man, and it's not long before Scates is on the run again.

A Special Forces team is tasked with hunting Scates down so that he may be properly exploited for scientific and military purposes. They needn't have bothered - Scates only hops around, growls, pants (yes, there is actually the sound of a dog panting when Scates runs through the forest), and occasionally shows up with blood on his chest.

Actors scream in terror to help make up for the fact that there's nothing scary about Scates whatsoever, other actors try to pretend they care about capturing Scates, and wolves flash on the screen for minutes at a time. The ending is stultifying lame, with a record ""fade out"" exit of a main character. That's right, he fades out of the scene.

This movie is a real dog. Actually, it's worse than that.

3394371,5,B0016MJ6H4,Surprisingly well made despite never even being heard of by me or my sci-fi friends. There is no actual werewolf or wolfman in it but it is more like a combination of Dark Angel with Jessica Alba and any werewolf movie. Genetic experimentation gone wrong(or very right?). It is better than I expected and is worth watching. Recommended!,1286064000,,336,4.810344827586207
3394372,5,B0016MJ6H4,"This movie has been marketed as a horror movie in the Maneater series, with plenty of blood and guts and gore, and that is not what this movie is about at all.  If you bought this thinking that is what you would get, then you will be sorely disappointed.  The gore scenes are extremely tame, particularly for this genre, and the acting seems a bit forced and the plot somewhat two-dimensional.  However, what this movie does do is that it paints the picture of wolves (and werewolves) not as mindless killers but as beings who live in harmony with their environment, and that humans play an essential part in that environment.  It brings forth the Native American message that wolves and humans are brothers, just as we are brothers to all living things, and that is a message that is unfortunately very much missing in modern mainstream cinema, especially in the horror genre.  I wouldn't call it a horror movie and I wouldn't call it New Age-y, but what it does do is to illustrate some important Native American wisdom.  It is a must buy for all wolf lovers, and even for those who are truly interested in the werewolf legend.",1286064000,,1129,4.592039800995025

8263276,2,B0016MJ6H4,"Although using a fun (if completely silly) idea to transplant an animals eyes into a human, 'Hybrid' wastes the idea by not getting any further than that original thought. Once the idea is established and acted on, the whole production slows down horribly and plods its way through to the ending. The idea of a human taking on traits of a wolf was given only passing credit and instead we get a hunt-em-down-and-shoot-em-up story which wore very thin very quickly.

There are a couple of names you might know in the production but they are wasted as they weren't given any real story or dialogue to work with. Yes, I know this is just an ultra cheap made for TV film but a bit more thought could have been put into the story and the script.

Not one of the better in the Maneater Series. The later outings like 'Ferocious Planet' and 'High Plains Invaders', while still cheap, are a better bet.",1475971200,,894,4.512345679012346

The movie just left a sour-taste in my mouth.
The ending was unsatisfying---to me, and I just wished there was a little more rhyme to the reason... so much humanity... such hostility... two wrongs don't make a right. Nah!

8263281,1,B0016MJ6H4,"The cover art on the DVD is purposely misleading.  This is not a werewolf flick, not even a variant of the same.  It is about a guy who receives wolf eyes from a mad scientist/doctor (Justine Bateman) and suddenly he can relate to his inner wolf.  As preposterous as that sounds, it gets worse.  With the new eyes came supersonic hearing as a bonus.  Although how that was managed, is anyone's guess.  Along with the officious automaton doctor (Bateman) there's also a nefarious secret band of military thugs who want the eyeball application then don't want it then want to kill wolf-boy because he's a loose cannon.  This movie relies heavily on nature footage of wolves, which they randomly insert throughout the course of this bizarre sci-fi flick.  There is zero suspense, little to no action, the supposed chewing of another doctor is done off screen, we have to rely on the assertion that he was gnawed to death by wolf-boy.  Eventually, a cast of thousands ends up in a forest where everyone runs wild in the longest/slowest foot chase in the history of the cinema.
Not a keeper.",1394668800,,1086,4.703703703703703
