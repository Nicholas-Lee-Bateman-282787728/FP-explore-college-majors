Each of these DVDs is listed on Amazon (and available for purchase) individually, where you can find more specific reviews of the movie plots, sound and video quality, etc, for each disc.  Thus, here I will not go into details of the individual movies, and instead focus on this five disc set as a whole.

To begin with, you can get this five disc set from Amazon sellers much cheaper than it would cost to buy all five discs individually.  So moneywise you're better off just buying this whole set.

Of course picture and sound quality vary greatly from movie to movie, but overall they are watchable, if not pristinely remastered (this is Alpha Video, so if you're familiar with their work this is about par for the course).  I was happily surprised by the sound quality, which, frankly, is more important to me than picture quality.  On most of these flicks the sound quality is pretty good, above average considering the age of the movies and general lack of remastering.

The movies in this set remind me a lot of the John Wayne ""Lone Star"" B-westerns from the early 1930s, though not quite that good, these here being even lower budget and lacking the creative action sequences and stunts of the Lone Stars (no Yakima Canutt here to liven things up).  Also, Tom Tyler comes across as a bit more clean cut and well mannered than The Duke does in those early roles.  Even so, I find Tom to be a really great guy and very much the hero; next to John Wayne, I'd put Tom at the top of my list of favorite B-movie heroes.

On which note, to digress for just a moment-the book by the prolific author Mike Chapman entitled, ""The Tom Tyler Story: From Cowboy Star to Super Hero"", available on Amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tom-Tyler-Story/dp/0967608082/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tom Tyler Story</a>, is an excellent work.  A concise and entertaining read at 132 pages, it is full of interesting info (and photos) about this great, and all too underrated, hero of the early silver screen (we could use a few Tom Tylers in America today).

Back to the DVD review: part of the fun of watching early low budget B-movies like this is catching the occasional blooper/screw up that didn't get corrected or edited out of the picture.  There are several to be found in this set.  I won't attempt to list them here, but I will mention that these guys must have filmed ""The Laramie Kid"" in one big hurry; during one particular segment of the movie I counted four obvious bloopers in the space of about ten minutes (a character bumps an object on a table with the barrel of his shotgun, Tom misses his horse's stirrup while trying to mount, the actress playing Tom's girlfriend flubs one of her lines, and a few minutes farther on, if you listen carefully, you can clearly hear the director giving her off camera direction).  At this point I quit counting; but hey, if you're a fan of B-westerns (as I am) such incidents just make the movie that much more entertaining!

If going strictly ""by the book"", I could honestly deduct one star for the horrifically low budgets (which cause these movies to contain a bit less creative action than what's to be found in some of your better B-westerns), and for the less than pristine sound and video quality (although still quite watchable and listenable taken as a whole).  However, despite those admitted shortcomings, I nevertheless give it five stars for the high entertainment value for the price (I got my set for about $20 bucks plus shipping) and most of all for the valiant efforts of the great, heroic Tom Tyler.  Buy it and enjoy!",1367020800,4,4006,4.68188302425107
