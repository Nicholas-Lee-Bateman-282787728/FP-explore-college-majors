1636445,5,B00005NP20,"I have seen this mini-serie on HBO, in my country, Brazil and I have LOVED it! I have readen Victor Hugo's Les Miserables several times and I have seen almost all the movie-screen versions of this romance and I can assure all that it is the best one! First, it follows the twists and turns of the book with almost meticulous details. Second, Grard Depardieu is the PERFECT Jean Valjean, almost to the bones of his crooked nose and slightly hunched back (read his description in Victor Hugo's book!) Liam Neeson is too elegant and too handsome to fit this description!!! Third,  as Les Miserables comes, longer is better, because there is so much to tell, so many nuances that the shorter versions do not show! And I would go on and on because that is one of my favorite books and this movie is my favorite version. A plus: John Malkovich as Inspector Javert is ousttanding and Christian Clavier as Thnardier oh, that is a trio you will not easily forget. Another movie made by the three of them is NAPOLEON, with Christian Clavier as Napoleon, John Malkovich as Taillerand (chilling as a machiavellian politician !) and Depardieu as Fouch, a minor role, but very important in the plot. If you REALLY want to see the very best version of LES MISERABLES see this movie. You will not regret the almost 7 hours of duration. To know the best of Victor Hugo go to the French versions! Hollywood may do great action movies but the classical...I prefer the French adaptations!(That is not a prejudice, but compare, if you will, the Hollywood version with Liam Neeson with this meticulous and very literary French version with Grard Depardieu and you will agree with me. That is the same with the Count of Monte-Cristo, starred by the same Grard Depardieu. Oh, well, if you can see a movie starred by Grard Depardieu I garantee it will ALWAYS be a good one, because Mr. Depardieu is one of the finest actors of our times.",1109116800,32,1912,4.607038123167156
1636446,4,B00005NP20,"Les Miserable is one of my favorite stories.  Depardu and Malkovich are two of my favorite actors.  Put those together and you have a great DVD.  However, I do not speak French, and after waiting and waiting for an English Subtitled Edition, I decided to go ahead and order it.  Well, I must say, I was not disappointed.  Knowing the story really, REALLY helped to know the dialogue, however, since I do not speak a WORD of French, having an English Subtitled Edition would be nice.",1074470400,2,482,4.558139534883721

1636474,5,B00005NP20,Great adaptation of the much-remade classic by Victor Hugo.  I wish it had been made it French.  John Malkovich surpasses the likes of Charles Laughton and Anthony Perkins as the relentless cop Javert.  Grard Depardieu works out an excellent transition from Valjean the brutish convict to Valjean the entrepreneur and philanthropist.  Virginie LeDoyen is so beautiful that I never considered how well she could act until I saw this film.  Go for it.,1419033600,2,449,5.095890410958904

1636476,5,B00005NP20,I have 3 versions of Les Miserables and this is the best one.  It covers more of the story since it is the longest version.  Love it.,1411084800,,133,3.888888888888889
1636487,5,B00005NP20,"This is a great production. No singing and dancing, just good drama. And it's in French, as it should be.",1400371200,,105,4.3
1636488,4,B00005NP20,"This version wasn't bad, but neither were any of the several other movie versions I've watched, none of which are really true to the book.  All had decent acting, although I absolutely could not watch the musical with Russell Crowe, because I just do not like musicals ... excepting Sound of Music.  I guess the one that came closest to duplicating the book was the mini series with Tony Perkins and Richard Jordan.  Unfortunately, the DVD of the series was apparently made by cutting and pasting sort of random parts of the original series, cheaper than making a two-DVD set.

It's probably unrealistic to expect too much from movies, especially if you've read the books.  Elmer Gantry had great acting by Jean Simmons, Burt Lancaster, and Shirley Jones, but only portrayed a tiny portion of the book, which was excellent and portrayed religion for the fraud that it is, and Elmer for the power-hungry, opportunistic scoundrel that he was.",1399852800,2,940,4.886792452830188

1636491,5,B00005NP20,Enjoyed seeing this version of the characters and action I had visualized.  I will watch it over and over because there is too much for just one viewing.,1380844800,,153,4.464285714285714
1636492,5,B00005NP20,This movie lasts 177 minutes. If you didn't read the novel this is the best movie for you to know the whole story. All the acting are excellent. A lot of the outdoor scenes and real indoor scenes.,1376179200,,196,4.184210526315789
1636493,5,B00005NP20,I much prefer this version of Les Miserables to the new musical. The characters are draw you in to the story.,1373414400,,109,4.238095238095238
1636494,4,B00005NP20,"Overall the movie wasn't too bad, but not my favorite film version. The ending was the biggest letdown for me. Javert just calmly walks into the river instead of jumping off the bridge. But I thought that Malkovick did basically play a good Javert.",1370044800,,248,4.659090909090909
1636495,5,B00005NP20,I saw this movie on Television. I think Gerard Depardieu is a good actor. I enjoy the movies he plays in.,1369440000,,105,4.0476190476190474
1636496,5,B00005NP20,"There are 2 Les Miserables ""types"": the musicals, and those that portray the novel in it's literary intent by the author. As far as the latter, for my input, nothing compares to this version. Before you buy it, MAKE SURE YOUR PLAYER WILL PLAY ""REGION 2"" DVD'S.
I saw this version on Fox Movie Channel around 2000-2001 and was mesmerized by it. I HAD to have it and when I finally found it back then in Europe I bought a player (the Oppo unit) that plays it.
One can see from this production why Gerard Depardieu is revered in Europe. His portrayal of Jean Valjean is stellar from the hard ex-con, winding through life to the kind, sacrificing, loving giant, and protector of the sweet Cosette. The final scene with them will break your heart when he thinks he is seeing an angel as he is dying.
Imagine for a moment what kind of a persistent hound John Malkovich is as inspector Javert who would imprison his own mother for walking on the wrong side of the street. When he speaks in this film, you are taken aback.
Fantine's character played by Charlotte Gainsbourg is done so well that it's actually a hard watch seeing what she has to endure.
Marius is wonderful with his initial infatuation and later obsession with Cosette and finally with how he treats her so tender and lovingly as she so richly deserved.
I could go on and on but if you know the novel, every aspect of it here will captivate you. If you are a ""deep"" type, you will have several tear sessions and this DVD will become one of your cherished possessions. I think it is 3 hours, maybe a little more but that gives the director the leeway to keep important detail intact. Some will say it is too long. If you're into the intimate detail in scenes, you will enjoy every minute.
This Les Miserables version is not a musical, it is not a scaled down version, it is not a ""Hollywoodish"" (for lack of a better term) version. It is a reference standard of the novel that will leave a permanent impression in your heart and mind. Unreservedly recommended with the highest respect.",1367712000,4,2042,4.462566844919786
1636517,5,B00005NP20,This is a very well done version of  Les Miserables. Most of the details were correct according ot the novel and that made me happy as most of the details have not been done well in past films.,1367625600,2,193,4.078947368421052
1636518,5,B00005NP20,"I am not one for musicals, but I am one for a good movie.  This novel adaptation is super tasty.  Grard Depardieu and John Malkovich are perfect in their rolls as some of the best characters fiction has ever seen.  I would recommend this movie to those who have and have not read the Book by Victor Hugo.",1362096000,,304,4.206896551724138
1636519,4,B00005NP20,"This 4-part, 6-hour TV adaptation of Les Misrables has a lot going for it. First of all, the length; it's the longest adaptation of the novel (arguably the greatest French novel of the 19th century, and one of the longest). It has a large cast, with some excellent actors. Unfortunately, it's filmed in the typically bland style of French TV, and the direction is nothing more than workmanlike. When I first started watching this, I was almost tempted to give up after 15 minutes. But it got better over time. (I had similar thoughts when watching a recent film based on Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu by the same director, also made for TV.)

Grard Depardieu plays Jean Valjean, and, for me, he doesn't quite fit the part. He's too big, too brash to have the subtlety the character needs. On the other hand, John Malkovich is an excellent Javert, though his dispassionate portrayal of the character can be seen as a bit too distant. Christian Clavier is Thnardier, and seems a bit out of place. A comic actor, generally in simple comedies, his persona doesn't quite fit. However, Virginie Ledoyen is nearly perfect as Cosette, with her innocence and fetching smiles.

But the main problem here is that everything is too clean, too heroic and idealized. Hugo did not write a novel where everyone is washed and shaved; he wrote about ""les misrables,"" the downtrodded, the poor. These are people who suffer, not people with clean shirts all the time. In this adaptation, everything is just a bit too perfect. (It's totally different from the recent adaptation of the musical, which, for all its faults, does show the characters in squalor.)

The good points here are the length: at 6 hours, you do get much more of the story - and it is a complex story - than other versions. But the mediocre direction, so-so acting, and overall approach make it lose points. It's worth watching if you're a fan of the novel.

By the way, the Amazon product information suggests that this is one DVD, 80 minutes long. I'm not sure if that's the case, or if this is the full 4-disc version.",1360195200,2,2079,4.656675749318801
1636520,4,B00005NP20,"Wish it had subtitle and keep the native language, French. Quality is poor, I believe it is becaus the movie is 13 years old and they didn't have the technology to record it in higher definition. I wish they remastered this movie. Good movie though. A masterpiece.",1358812800,,264,4.638297872340425
1636521,2,B00005NP20,"I have seen around 5 film versions of one of my favorite novels of all time, but all of them comes about disappointing, and I really don't get it either, I really don't think it's that hard of a novel to film an entirely faithful version to the novel. But people may plead the novel's length being a handicap to film all the plot from the book into a movie, and they may have a point. However, with this long version with its total running time nearing 7 hours, starring the Meryl Streep of the French, there is almost zero excuse. I am not complaining at all about the things they've omitted (which are actually very few) but the things they could've stayed entirely faithful to the spirit of Hugo they changed into a lame act. For example, Jean Valjean telling Marius that he is actually in love with Cosette, thus causing Marius to banish him, can I just say WTF? The bishop in the beginning knew the Jean Valjean was going to steal the silver so he was testing him, which of course, stood entirely contrary to the character of the bishop in Hugo's words, that he is innocent like an angel smiling while spreading her wings and surrendering to the mysteries of the world and of God. Also Jean Valjean aggressively taking the money from Petit Gervais in the beginning while looking greedily at the money, when in fact at that point he doesn't know anymore why he is taking the money from the child. He is in that state in which we start doing things that we don't know why we are doing it, we just do them because we are in great turmoil, I'm sure everybody had those moments. Jean Valjean should've been played by a broody actor, and I feel that Depardieu is a serious miscast. The same goes for Malkovich as Javert, who is supposed to be someone whose ""heart is made of wood"" and doing everything by sticking to one principle. But Malkovich's Javert is just this annoyingly evil character who seems to get off of other people's sufferings. Hugo's Javert, on the other hand, is APATHETIC to other people's sufferings, he doesn't get off on them. I seriously think that David Boreanaz would've done a better job as Jean Valjean, even though he doesn't look or speak French. Honestly, if I was the writer or director of this mini-series I would've chosen much better actors (as in suiting for the role) and make a much more faithful script in Hugo's spirit. I mean, common people, what the heck is wrong with a blond Fantine?. Believe me, 7 hours is more than enough to make an entirely faithful Les Miserables on screen, but the producers of this film made all the bad decisions and wrong changes, which is greatly disappointing, I believe Hugo himself would've been puzzled.",1357948800,15,2677,4.533057851239669
1636522,1,B00005NP20,Unfortunately I have been spoilt by seeing the four part miniseries french with english subtitles of Les Miserables and that is what I thought I was ordering. Instead I received  a shortened film version. The miniseries was fantastic and gave far more depth to the characters and understanding of the relationships between the characters. I was very disappointed to have received the same film that I had already bought previously especially with shipping And handling costs as well! If anyone can shed some light on how I can purchase the four part miniseries I would be very grateful.,1357862400,5,586,4.979591836734694
1636523,1,B00005NP20,"Sorry. Stick this version back in the box. With all the time they had to explore Hugo's fabulous story, they managed only a shallow expression of the characters. Accents were all over the place and some of the scenes seemed quite unrehearsed or even unwritten with actors throwing in quaint idioms from mid-20th century.",1357171200,2,320,4.944444444444445

1636525,5,B00005NP20,"Since I am a French person who lives in the USA, I consider myself lucky whenever I come across a French movie in the original version.  I intentionally bought this original French version of les Misrables without English subtitles. The mini-series totally meets my expectations: I love Victor Hugo drama, Depardieu's rendition of Jean Valjean, as well as the whole cast and the photography. Being able to enjoy a French production without any subtitles on the screen is also a plus for me.

1636544,5,B00005NP20,"This review refers to ""Les Miserables"" (region 2 edition)

This 4 part production of ""Les Miserable"", that was televised, is magnificent. It is the best I have seen. Gerard Depardieu was absolutlely Jean Valjean, the ex-convict who suffers and sacrifices on his journey to redemption. Javert, the lawman intent on the capture of Valjean, comes alive in the form of one John Malkovich. It is directed by Jose Dayan,  and Valjean's feelings towards Cosette a more obvious romantic take. My French is limited, but I had no trouble getting swept away to the time, the place, the events, and with every emotion portrayed exquisitly by these intense actors. Charlotte Gainsbourg as Fantine, Virginie Ledoyen as Cosette, Christian Clavier and Veronica Ferres, as M. and Mme Thenardier, and Enrico Lo Verso as Marius add their remarkable portrayals as well.

The DVD is formatted for Region 2 viewers. Check with the sellers for languages, subtitles and features. I have the Region 1 edition(French Only, ASIN: B0002VJIGY  ),an import from Canada, and there are 2 DVDs, each in their own snap case, with 2 parts of the 4 on each disc. Each disc running about 3 hours. The picture was very nice, clear, with good colors. There is a scene with Fantine in the cold stark streets, looking like death, and draped in a red shawl that took my breath away. There are some extra feautres on both discs(pertaining to Hugo, the story and the actors), but this may be a time when your French would come in handy, as they are all in the form of production notes, and all in Francais! I bought this new, and there were no inserts that came with it. The back of the box shows these DVD specifications: NTSC, Zones 1-6, Continent 2 DVD9.

If you love this magnificent work by Victor Hugo, you MUST see this version. The performance is powerful!

1636546,3,B00005NP20,"As far as the acting goes, I thought this was very well acted, but the one sticking point I had was the whole love triangle between Valjean, Cosette, and Marius.  I have read the unabridged version (one of my favorite books) and I never got such a thing from the book.  I don't think that Valjean ever loved Cosette in a romantic way, but did want her for himself in a selfish way, for the love (non-romantic and very fatherly) that he did have for her.  This was one of the several tests that Valjean goes through during the novel.  If you really read the novel you will find it is more about Valjean being tested to go back on his promise to change his life than anything else.  He always makes the right choice, even after trying to convince himself otherwise.  Such is the case with saving Marius and allowing the marriage.  He does it for her good then withdraws from her life in order not to tarnish her promising future with his ugly past.  I have yet to see a movie that really portrays this central theme of Valjean enduring to the end with his conviction to be an honest man, with the ultimate test being separating himself from his daughter.  Trying to make him romantically inclined towards the daughter he raised seems just weird and wrong to me anyway - must be a French thing.",1109203200,36,1291,4.390756302521009
