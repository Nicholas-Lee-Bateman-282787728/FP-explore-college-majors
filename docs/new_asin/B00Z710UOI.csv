7270876,4,B00Z710UOI,Awesome. Especially the guy who played Sammy,1445558400,,44,5.428571428571429
7270877,3,B00Z710UOI,"Well, at least they managed to come up with a horror movie that was decent enough to hold my attention, although the array of characters were the usual type of party animals. There are cute girls, good looking guys and one of course, who is an ass, but I laughed at him anyway. Lance Henriksen is the pilot of a boat that takes visitors to a place called Blarney Island, once inhabited by mobsters. There are no trees, shrubs or anything attractive about it, because it's a very large night club on a lake. The youngsters are warned, but of course, they're looking for a great time of drinking and dancing, which they certainly get. What else they get is terror. The place is haunted. Not really a bad movie, just ok.",1443312000,3,717,4.4393939393939394
7270878,1,B00Z710UOI,Saw the high rating from a few people and gave it try. Don't waste your time or money. It was beyond bad. Makes those Syfy movies look like Triple A blockbusters.,1443312000,,162,4.258064516129032
7270879,3,B00Z710UOI,Interesting premise but not that scary & some of the acting sucked.,1443139200,,67,4.666666666666667
7270880,5,B00Z710UOI,"I don't usually like horror movies, but I sure liked this one! Great to see Ben Elliott and Randy Wayne from the Lying Game.",1443139200,,124,4.208333333333333
7270881,3,B00Z710UOI,Boring.  Definitely felt like I'd seen it before.,1442620800,,49,5.125
7270882,5,B00Z710UOI,Hands down one of the most creative horror movies ever.  The cast was able to bring so much fear and raw emotion to this film it was truly an incredible experience. Ben Elliott from 'the lying game' really stepped up to the plate as well as Lance playing the creepy older guy.  All in all 5/5 stars and a must buy before Halloween!,1442275200,3,331,4.238095238095238
7270883,5,B00Z710UOI,Never heard of this movie and got it out of the blue. It's worth the buy.,1441843200,3,73,3.625
7270884,3,B00Z710UOI,I thought the movie was o.k. I like Brianna evil an and she did good in the movie and so did lance Hendrickson. There was not enough action in the movie as there was not much going on in the first fifty minutes of the film. The ghost was cgi and not overly scary. The concept of the island on a lake was good.,1441670400,4,309,3.84375
7270885,3,B00Z710UOI,"This was actually pretty decent. Most of the B movies on here are pretty terrible, but the acting was ok and the idea was neat. Not terrible. I liked it enough to be the first to review. :)",1441324800,4,189,4.0
7270896,4,B00Z710UOI,ive seen worse and ive sen better,1479427200,,33,3.857142857142857
7270897,4,B00Z710UOI,I liked it for the most part I really liked when Lance Henriksen tells how the island came be how it is there's plenty of fright but the ending part is what I really liked.,1479081600,,172,3.942857142857143
7270898,5,B00Z710UOI,"Great item, great price!",1474761600,,24,5.25
7270899,5,B00Z710UOI,Terrible (in scary movies that means great) D-List movie.,1474588800,,57,5.444444444444445
7270900,1,B00Z710UOI,I can't give it a -1 so I'm forced to give it a 1. Bad acting plus bad story (which didn't even make any sense) equals a really bad movie! I can't believe I was stupid enough to pay to watch this movie.,1473292800,,202,3.7209302325581395
7270901,4,B00Z710UOI,"I did not expect great things with this movie, but it was entertaining! I did like it! Exciting.",1471564800,,96,4.388888888888889

7270903,1,B00Z710UOI,What a waste of money. Terrible Movie,1456358400,,37,4.428571428571429
7270904,1,B00Z710UOI,"I bought a ton of inexpensive horror movies for the season and some were really nice surprises.  This one was awful.  I felt honestly like it was made by a couple of kids with no experience and I have no idea how they got the bigger name actor to appear in this thing.  I hate giving it such a low rating, but I couldn't get through the entire thing.",1447027200,,350,4.043478260869565
7270905,1,B00Z710UOI,Do not watch,1445558400,,12,3.3333333333333335
8719534,3,B00Z710UOI,"a terribly slow beginning, a dark and dull middle, but a perky ending.  acting was not too bad, but you have heard this tale before.",1531526400,,132,4.28
8719535,3,B00Z710UOI,"Good story, good acting, a step above a B movie",1524441600,,47,3.8

8719537,1,B00Z710UOI,Absolute rubbish. It was as though they hired a child to write the dialog.,1523404800,,74,4.357142857142857
8719538,5,B00Z710UOI,"It has Lance Henriksen in it, so you know it is a high budget and classy thriller.",1523318400,,82,3.8823529411764706
8719539,2,B00Z710UOI,"I watched for Lance Henriksen, but this movie is just pretty bad...  With a budget of over $2M, they did essentially nothing...

The acting was pretty rigid / sub-par for the most part...  Camera work was mediocre at best...  I guess at least the audio was ok...

Biggest fail is that it delivered virtually no scares...  There's no gore in the flick...  and the ""evil caretaker ghost"" was really quite awful...  The special effects were extremely lackluster...

Are there worse ghost stories out there?  You bet...  but this one certainly wasn't anything to write home about...  I guess still moderately entertaining and everyone's mileage may vary...  But I'm sticking with like a 2.5 stars ( rounded down for actually having a budget and not doing much with it... )",1522713600,2,768,4.8604651162790695
8719540,2,B00Z710UOI,"I can honestly say that I was hoping to like this but alas, that did not happen. The awful story, which could have been good if it had been handled right, wasn't. The acting was nightmarish to say the least. And one character was going to school to be a forensic paranormal investigator????? what is that?????I just really was rooting for the bad misty spirit to win and kill each and everyone of these bad actors. They really did need to do something a lot better than this to catch my interest.",1502668800,,496,4.4021739130434785
8719541,4,B00Z710UOI,"Overall, I liked this movie. Yes, the acting is not great and the story line is murky but it does have some creepy scenes. As another reviewer noted, the intro storytelling by Lance Henriksen is very good-- not as good as John Houseman in the original The Fog, but good. The first 10 minutes gives you about all you need to know. After that, you can skip to about 42-45 minutes in when the island bar closes. The special effects are not great but again, some creepy scenes and basically a creepy setting. I didn't notice any nudity and no obvious gore. It's basically a good late Friday or Saturday night movie with some pizza.",1501804800,2,627,4.460869565217391
8719542,1,B00Z710UOI,It came in good condition but the movie itself is pretty cheesy. Not worth $10. Maybe $5. Can I have $5 back?,1498003200,,109,4.0
8719543,3,B00Z710UOI,"I so wanted to like this movie. I really go for movie that have attractive ""teens"" (usually look early 20's) having fun then getting picked off one by one by a supernatural force. This movie wanted to be that and it kind of was but was just done poorly. The whole premise is that in the middle of some lake in middle America is a giant party barge/island that has a sorted past having to do with illegal booze, gambling, and murder. Well that sets the scene for why there are potentially ghosts in the bar. In fact, no one who has worked there longer than a summer will stay after midnight. Yet on these kids first day! they stay after midnight and their ride disappears (one can only get to this island by boat, and none of the kids have their own boat so the boss drives them in).

This really could have been a good teen slasher flick but it just wasn't, if you have nothing else to watch and don't really feel like scraping the the bottom of the barrel of prime just yet then this isn't to bad. Some of the actors were recognizable and did the best with what they had but over all this movie was pretty bad.",1481673600,3,1111,4.191588785046729
