5351145,5,B009LYG5YG,I saw this movie at a couple of film festivals and it was creepy.  The movie Unaware won awards and if you watch you will see why. I wish I did not have to wait till March to buy this movie. I have been waiting for this release for awhile and now I can finally show my friends this found footage I have been telling them about. I don't want to ruin the footage but seeing it really put the missing  pieces together for me. This movie or footage makes you wonder what else  the government is still hiding from us and why they don't want us to know. I wonder how long this footage will be available after its release before the government pulls it and locks it away or destroys it. Anyway I got to see Unaware twice and can't wait to get it the first day to make sure I get a copy just in case.,1359072000,2,792,3.9685534591194966

5351147,1,B009LYG5YG,"This movie is so terrible!  It is hard to describe how awful this movie is, I cannot believe this was under the recommended horror films genre on my account!  This qualifies more as a comedy than a horror flick, the acting is just that bad!  Do not waste your time with this one.",1500940800,,279,4.226415094339623
5351148,1,B009LYG5YG,"So I just LOVE when I can tell from the hop that someone actually has NO formal film school training (or they flunked) --- the script? AWFUL. the actors? Him/maybe.. Her/Please someone in God's name tell me what HE would be doing with short, screechy, Fellowship of the Dwarves. porky her? The Agents/Clearly the Dads of whomever is making this ""film"" --- MISCAST is an understatement as this film should never have BEEN cast  .... Next, build-up is one thing.........TORTURE, an entire *other* thing.  The ONLY redeeming quality to this ""film"" was the alien (Great job FX dept.)~ Entirely implausible, however, that it would lay dormant in a crate since 1947 then just ""light-up and run around the yard"" b/c Doofy opened the crate, also sending a homing beacon so the ship can FINALLY pick it up. No, sorry, PLEASE iPhone filmmakers and wannabe's GET THIS: go to FILM SCHOOL (a REAL on, like I did) and until you do STOP MAKING THESE AWFUL MOVIES. It's that old adage ... Just because you ""can"" does NOT mean that you ""should"". PS to the cast: Y'all are not movie stars now. Sorry to burst your bubble.",1500422400,,1103,4.651282051282052
5351149,3,B009LYG5YG,"I liked the promise of using aliens and such to drive the plot. However, the setup in the mysterious barn was extremely lackluster. You guys seriously couldn't spring for better practical effects?",1499904000,,196,5.15625
5351150,4,B009LYG5YG,"This movie is good for what it is. It's not great. It's no Hollywood blockbuster with a multi-million dollar budget. It's a simple movie meant to feel like you are watching someone's home videos. It pulls this off nicely. I do share in another reviewer's nitpick, though:

(MINOR SPOILER) They are talking about Majestic 12 and General Ramey like they have NO IDEA what any of that stuff is. EVERYONE knows that story. Even if you aren't into UFOs, you've come across it at some point or heard about it. There were only a couple of parts where the dialogue felt a little bit stilted and unnatural, but for the most part they interact like a genuine couple and... Good lord can she scream.",1496620800,2,688,4.548387096774194
5351151,3,B009LYG5YG,"Decided to watch the film without knowing anything about it. I was unaware exactly what to expect. I have to say it really kept me guessing until about midpoint.

Spoiler alert!!!!!!!

I really thought this might become a psycho thriller. For that reason, it was quite suspenseful in the beginning. Would we learn that the guy lures unsuspecting women to his place in the woods where his split-personality takes over and we learn he has done this for dozens of women. Now, that would have been a thriller. But no. We would eventually learn that instead of a psycho thriller, it was a Sci-Fi flick. As a B-movie, it wasn't bad.",1494720000,,626,4.63063063063063
5351152,2,B009LYG5YG,"Ok.  I have to admit this was so slow and so bad that I had to fast forward through some of it looking for interesting points to play.  The acting was horrible, even for a, ""found footage,"" film.  The premise behind the film was interesting which is the only reason I gave this a two star rating instead of a solo star.  I liked the concept of going for a surprise visit at the grandparents, only to find they're on vacation themselves.  I could see that happening in my family.  Grandkids are always welcome to come make themselves at home whenever they like.  They don't need to tell us they're coming.  It would be nice to know so we could stock up, but not necessary.  I'd hope they respect us enough to follow some very simple rules of our home, though, like don't break into a locked building and don't mess with our cars!  Back to the film - visiting the grands and finding out grandpa was involved in a top secret alien conspiracy.  Good concept with bad acting and bad direction.  This is an idea that would work well with a huge Hollywood budget.",1493856000,,1056,4.358974358974359

5351155,1,B009LYG5YG,"This movie was rated two and a half starts or so, and is basically a zero. Bad camcorder plot with silly banter between a couple visiting his grandpa's barn and finding bad secrets. Maybe the end is ok, as another reviewer said, but I couldn't make it to the end. Waste of time, I hope nobody would pay for this. Amazon is filling their PRIME movie selections with poor production quality loser flicks. SHame.",1491004800,2,409,4.54054054054054

Common sense would tell you to get a motel instead of staying there and they stayed. Another ""unaware"" thing that both the couple did was they kept jacking up the locks and busting into things and barely knew about the extra terrestrials stories. Don't they read?

5351170,1,B009LYG5YG,"Having read some good and bad reviews of this ""Movie"" I wanted to point out what bothered me most don't know if these have been mentioned or not. So O.K. this is a SPOILER ALERT so you know...1st you can skip all but the last 15 minutes of this film to see any real action happen. Now about the ""Actors"", IF they are supposedly REAL ppl then I could excuse how boring they were but I don't know ANYBODY that walks around all the time with a camera filming another person
just talk about nothing. IF they were actors (Supposedly these 2 ppl were never seen again) they were very bad.

Now the plot stupidity...Not only do they find ""TOP SECRET"" Govt papers in the barn file cabinet...they looked them up ONLINE!! That was to convince them that these were real...but REALLY? The Dish for T.V. didn't even work out there where was the wi-fi? Then they CALL the
F.B.I. and and Agent comes out quickly...again REALLY? BUT what bothered me most was WHY, OH WHY was it dark every time they decided to go back into the barn? Why not put the car there and have the headlights on the inside of the barn? Better yet why didn't they get the hell out as soon as they got freaked out?

Now that ending...so now there were literally ""Little Green men"" running around on their film and the F.B.I. Agents (M.I.B. guys) show up and step on the camera...IF this indeed was REAL, does anybody really think the Feds would let it out?

So there's the whole Movie for you except I am not sure if ""Grandpa"" was keeping these Aliens or they were activated by these nosey ppl? But I guess the barn itself was really a functioning UFO that takes the girl at the end? Then the Feds take the guy? I haven't a clue but this is certainly NOT scary nor REAL LIFE. But it was REALLY boring.",1481155200,,1757,4.302114803625377
5351171,2,B009LYG5YG,Okay..so this was rated as an a thriller/horror when it was definitely a comedy. The girlfriend will make you laugh with her misconcept of things and her hilarious screams. The aliens itself were cheap looking and quite laughable. If you want to relax and laugh your heart out. watch this movie. Have no idea who was it who wrote how amazing and thrillful this was..that was not the case..lol,1481155200,,392,4.695652173913044

5351174,2,B009LYG5YG,"** 2 Stars **  The thing I liked best in this very slow flick was the setting ... I'm from a small town in tidewater Virginia, and while I'm not sure where this was filmed, it sure did remind me of my grandparent's house, way out in the country, surrounded by woods.  Fortunately, they didn't keep monsters in the garage, best I recall.. ""Unaware"" does offer an imaginative story, but it unwinds so very slowly....",1478736000,,414,4.506666666666667
5351175,2,B009LYG5YG,"This wasn't as bad as some found footage movies I've seen, but it wasn't great either.  It was challenging to keep watching after the first few minutes, mostly because the main actor was so unlikable.  Actually his girlfriend, nay, fiancee (spoiler alert, sorry! <3) was equally unlikable.  For every moment of building tension as they begin snooping around the shed/barn, there was another moment of these two characters being unlikable and annoying.  It was difficult to get drawn into their experience with finding the alien materials because of the girl's audio-clipping screams when something big would happen.  As a lover of found footage movies, I've gotten used to the frantic whining of weak characters but it seemed extra distracting this time.",1477872000,7,754,5.198347107438017
5351176,2,B009LYG5YG,"Not a big fan of found footage films but I gave this one a look, please don't ask me why.  I can't say that I would recommend this to anyone as a fun way to spend 90 minutes or so.  Acting was horrible. The story was wholly unbelievable.  Just not a good premise and not well executed.  This only serves to strengthen my desire to NOT view films in this genre.",1477699200,,360,4.028169014084507

5351187,1,B009LYG5YG,"This is a very slow movie.  I found the main character's very irritating.  A grandson and his girlfriend planned a surprise visit to the Grandson's Grandparents. The Grandparents were not home but left a note to the gardener explaining that they would not return until Sunday night. Grandson, then breaks into Grandparents home and makes himself at home eating their food and doing all the things he was not allowed to do as a child. He even got to start his Grandpa's pristine muscle car which gave him glee. Then he decides to break into the barn he was told never to enter and after destroying the lock and removing the countless chains; forbidding entrance, he discovers Grandpa's hidden secret. Hysteria envelopes them for heaven knows how long and for the last 10 minutes of the film, the movie picks up pace and actually has some action to it.

So the movie moved along nicely the plot got thicker more and more grabbing your curiosity.  And then he finds it an alien.  However the actions of the couple kinda weird first of the alien was lit up in a box we assumed it was still alive and to close the box back and leave.  Not our actors they run out leaving the box opened and face their doom towards the end.  But we had a few questions where did the grandparents really go bc we thought we heard him say he was coming to surprise them then he says they were in vegas for the weekend?

5351214,4,B009LYG5YG,"Im probably biased since Im from D/FW and very familiar with Carswell AFB's involvment with the Roswell crash debris. I can tell you that the guys who made this movie brilliantly exploited a tiny opening in the timeline of the real life events that actually did happen. Everything that the fictional couple discovered from their online research is factual and verifiable. But instead of the debris going to Ohio it ended up in the barn of a serviceman that served at Carswell in 1947. Freak'n brilliant! I just saw Unaware, for the first time, last weekend. I liked the movie because its the only one that actually highlights Fort Worth's involvment with the Roswell incident. But I also liked the story.

If you think that the only thing wrong with Signs is that it wasn't more like Paranormal Activity... well, you might still be disappointed. That's how blandly awful this movie is, babe.

Seriously babe, nobody wants 40+ minutes of unnecessary backstory featuring two one-dimensional characters who you're sick of long before anything actually happens. Especially when the stuff that happens doesn't make up for it.

And babe, the dialogue? I guess it was naturalistic, in the sense that real uninteresting people do talk to each other like this. And I'm sure a lot of real people do go from barely emoting to ""WTF!!! Let's run around screaming!!!!"" in the blink of an eye.

Samuel Morse could learn a few things about telegraphing from these filmmakers. First few minutes: babe, here's a southwestern military base, my grandfather works there, secret secret. A few minutes later: babe, my grandfather never let me go in the barn. Hmm... can YOU finish the story? Or more to the point, should you bother?",1465084800,3,1148,4.907216494845361

5351223,1,B009LYG5YG,"**SPOILERS**
First of all, believe none of the 5 star reviews posted right at the time of the film's release. You'll note the people who posted them have reviewed this film and nothing else since. They're actually either the filmmaker or their friends, who have clearly been trolling through amazon/imdb etc (you can see comments clearly by them, namely how they refer to this as footage and not a film) to big it up. The blatantly poor viral marketing harmed it for me, the film did the rest.

They have, I belive, one alien costume, first seen empty in a crate, the camera doesn't focus long to spoil it for you. I will give them credit for a very good scare when the camera pulls away to reveal the alien looking in the window. That one got me. But it was only that. The rest is just the couple talking and eating and arguing about going to the barn, or going back into the barn. It's really only got anything going for it at the end. There are also some Blues Brothers MIB (one notably overweight and unfit for a dangerous government black ops guy)

This film is supposed to make you think about aliens and, as quoted from the fillmakers 'get you off the fence about believing about aliens'. This film seems to imply it's more important to fool people with poor marketing and bad filmmaking than actually prove anything. If skeptics watch this, they just got a whole load more skeptical. The film is good for maybe that one scare, the alien coming out the bushes and the woman screaming and turning the camera  away (likely to hide how poorly the costume looks in full use) was spoiled by the trailer so not counting that as a scare in the film.

Just give this a miss or wait for it coming on netflix or to a .99c bargain bin. Don't waste your money. You can honestly get better found footage alien films on Youtube in full for free.",1444953600,3,1838,4.397058823529412

Sometimes, a movie drags on and you don't mind it.  Then, there are movies like this one... where the first 15 odd minutes is just the couple babbling in the car.  15 minutes is excessively long for this particular mechanic and nothing useful was even discussed besides a few tidbits about grandpa that could have been covered in a 30 second chat.  If you have a part of the film the audience wants to fast forward through, you're doing it wrong.

Of course, the rest of the film similarly drags on, but at least they toss in the occasional ""mystery"" moment where one or both of the pair see or notice something out of place to take the viewer out of the haze.  Like many such films, the last 15-20 minutes is the money shot.  Not much, but after such abysmal pacing before it, any change of pace is welcome.  A cracker to a starving man, if you will.

There were minor things that bugged me, but I wouldn't hold it against the film, just my own personal preferences.  Things like:  When you open a gate on a driveway in the country, you are supposed to close it behind you.  Just common courtesy and you would be respectful to your grandparent's home.  Small, minor details, but if you spent time out in farmland, you notice.  Also, the 'editing' trick, where the screen loops and goes to static... stop that.  I really don't need a blast of static ringing out from my surround sound just as I turned it up to hear their conversation.  I expect that type of thing to blur out the aliens or whatever, not when they are just chatting.  That was annoying.

Worth a watch, a rent, a stream, whatever.  Wouldn't buy it....  Like most found footage, it is a time waster that does simply that:  Waste time.",1388707200,,1800,4.420731707317073

5351256,1,B009LYG5YG,"*** WARNING: SPOILERS ****

I was hooked by the tag line for this movie; it had real promise.  Unfortunately, it's just not well made.  And, no, I don't mean the whole found footage trope; that's fine, I actually like those kinds of movies which is why I chose this one.

No, the reason I say it wasn't professionally made was due to a number of things in the film:

1) The acting.  They just weren't very good. Maybe a lot was improvised, and the actors weren't great improvisers, or else they just didn't have much to work with.  But they seemed to be too aware of the fact that they were acting.

2) The writing.  Assuming the movie wasn't completely improvised, and even if it was, there was still an overall ""story"" they had to follow.  Even still, the story wasn't very good, and certainly the story wasn't moved forward very well.  The plot points were all poorly connected (i.e., unnatural and forced).  The motivations at times made no damn sense, and the central plot point, that aliens were being kept in a the main character's grandfather's old barn, was beyond silly - as it was written.  The grandfather kept alien artifacts and/or alien bodies in nearly  plain view in a barn just a hundred yards from the street, with nothing but a flimsy door and easily broken chain to ""secure"" them?  It took the main character almost 30 seconds to break in.  Yet the grand father is portrayed as an ex-military secretive type.  But he keeps one of the most astounding secrets of mankind secured inside a building and crate so easily found?

3) The directing.  For example, even if we accept that the barn-alien-storage made sense somehow, or at least, the script somehow couldn't be changed to due budget reasons, then the director should have had the wherewithal to realize that such story elements detracted from the story, and needed to be addressed somehow.  Either by additional dialogue, or better character setup, backstory, etc.  Another example is the set dressing for the interior of the barn.  It was supposed to be old, and containing old and used military equipment and boxes.  It didn't look old, or well used at all.  And there were old news clippings held up above the desk.  Only two clippings, and only the ones related to the story.  They were too neatly and obviously located.  The classified documents were in a cabinet next to the desk and were at the top of the stack, and were exactly the docs related to the story and the aliens.  The characters didn't have to hunt for anything.  They walked in, saw the alien storage crates, the old desk and news clippings and opened the cabinet and found the secret docs.  In a perfectly clean room. The director didn't even have the characters search the entire barn.  The artifacts were all directly behind the door they opened on that side of a very large barn.  They didn't look anywhere else in the barn.  No notion of the stuff being old or hidden or a workspace was at all communicated or part of the ambiance of the space.  Very amateur.

I could go on, but that's enough.",1379462400,,3045,4.596654275092937

As if a rickety, dilapidated barn with a padlock on the door is going to protect history-making secrets from making it to the public at large.  Second of all, the make-up effects are hilarious -- lots or rubbery-looking things that make the muppets look like real animals.  The acting was also a joke, not to mention the script and the relationship between the main characters (why this dim-bulb would propose to his girl in his sweaty t-shirt first thing in the morning in his gradma's breakfast nook is an absolute mystery).  Anyway, don't be swayed by the stellar reviews for this nonsense.  You'd do a lot better watching something like the Wicksboro Incident or Grave Encounters or even The Fourth Kind.  These are also subpar found footage flicks, but compared to Unaware, they're like Close Encounters of the Third Kind-quality.  I was so disappointed.  I read the good reviews, I slapped my cash on the barrel-head, and all I got for it was the gloomy regret of 90 irretrievable minutes of my life.  Do yourself a favor: skip it.",1370563200,8,1423,4.778688524590164
5351268,1,B009LYG5YG,"The joke is on me.  This  movie is a total dud, I kept waiting for something to happen, Girl screaming in garage was the highlight of the whole thing.  It's not the actors fault, it was just lacking something, like a story line.",1369958400,,228,4.255813953488372
5351269,2,B009LYG5YG,"Imagine the most boring couple you know setting up a camcorder in their living room and complaining to each other for two days. The chick's fat and the only time she isn't complaining is when she's eating. The guy proposes to her, and she eats some more. A really bad movie. In one scene, the fat chick says, ""There's something out there!"" and I told my wife ""It sure as hell isn't a director."" ""Found footage"" movies pretty much suck anyway, and this one's about as bad as it gets. The movie should have been called ""Unaware of How to Make a Decent Movie."" If fat, nagging wives scare you, then by all means buy this movie and be frightened to death. If bathtubs out in fields scare you, then buy this movie. If a guy running up a driveway scares you, then buy this movie. If you pretend to make movies with a camcorder, then you'll probably like this movie because you'll correctly feel that you can make a movie as good as this one. It's rather like people who like Bob Seger. If you can only play three chords on a guitar, you love Bob Seger because you can play all his songs. ""Unaware"" sucked big time.",1369008000,2,1108,4.30622009569378
5351270,3,B009LYG5YG,"The movie was good. I am giving it three stars because of the shaky camera effect. I hate shacky camera. I will not buy another movie that is done this way. This movie was okay, but not as good as the reviews described.",1367193600,,219,4.116279069767442
5351271,2,B009LYG5YG,"Seeing all the rave reviews, I came into this expecting the thrill of a lifetime. Frankly, I found ""Downton Abbey"" more frightening. There literally was not a moment when I was the least bit spooked in this film.

The film is about a couple who go out to visit the guy's grandparents. They drive for a bit and nothing happens. Then they hang out for a bit at the house and nothing happens. Then they go to the garage and they hear an electric hum, but nothing happens. They go back to the house for a while and nothing happens. They go back to the garage, poke around for a bit, see a rubber mask and, like Scooby Do and Shaggy they run in terror from a rubber mask. Then they sit around for a bit and nothing happens.

You get the idea. There is a whole lot of nothing in this movie.

The film refers to other films such as ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Friday the 13th"". One common trait those two films have is that they are both much better and much scarier than ""Unaware"".

Seriously, this movie feels like a group of friends got together one weekend, bought a rubber mask, and decided to improvise a movie. They reason it's called ""Unaware"", I hypothesize, is how unaware I was of its quality when I rented it.

So if it's so bad, why did I give it two stars instead of one? Because I thought the lead actors both showed genuine potential. Maybe they'll appear in better films in the future.",1366761600,31,1398,4.28030303030303
5351272,5,B009LYG5YG,"Well, I had heard of this movie a long while before it was released and i had high expectations for this movie. And did my expectations fullfill? Yes, they did. This movie was just simply great. The main roles was very good and you really did care about them.
The first part of this film goes very slowly forward and that's not a bad thing at all. The build up is perfect and it all comes down to the ending scenes wich are pretty frightening.

My final word about the movie called Unaware is that this movie is a very nicely made horror movie. Perfectly made for this genre of movies and it actually has a cast you get to care about.
Buy this movie because it is really worth it.
I had a great time watching it!",1366329600,,712,4.159420289855072
5351273,1,B009LYG5YG,"No one talks that way! The couple in this film acted as if they were on a first date. It was clear from the beginning this was completely fabricated simply because of the ""POOR"" acting and corny dialogue. Joe makes the comment that he does not want his grandfather implicated....DAH...the crap is ""ON"" his grandfathers property...STUPID is the only word I can think of to describe this film. The 4-5 star rating was the only reason I purchased this DVD...Obviously its not for acting ability. The movie would not of been half bad if it were not for the ridiculous acting!!!!!",1365984000,,575,4.702970297029703
5351274,5,B009LYG5YG,"I was first introduced to this amazing found footage film ""UNAWARE"" when submitted to the 2011 Indie Horror Film Festival where if won Best Feature & Best Special Effects.  When I first started screening the film I was a bit skeptical of the quality, but it is indeed a found footage film so I gave it some time.  The first 30 minutes had me convinced it wouldn't amount to much, but then the creepy clues of something so much bigger started to appear.  These quick peeks and clues certainly captured my interest and built much suspense along with the couple in the film.  I don't want to spoil it, but the pay off is great!  In this film you get compassion, you get anger, you get suspense, you get shock, you get scare and you get satisfied!

The couple was annoying, especially the girl, the suspense that all the others seemed to be talking about was no where to be found and the effects were kinda lame. It was a great story idea runined by long, long drawn out couple bulls***. Then when things finally happen - it ends! This footage should have never been found LOL. Check out THE BAY instead!",1365379200,,514,4.421052631578948

5351277,2,B009LYG5YG,"Let me begin by saying that in the past few years I have really gotten into watching independent horror movies. I have found them to usually be very refreshing from the continuous stream of torture porn that passes for horror coming out of the major market. Always on the lookout for new and highly recommended movies, I found this one with mostly 5 and 4 star reviews and felt it was a pretty safe bet. Now I am unsure if I actually watched the same movie, because if this is a 4 - 5 star movie then I must not understand how the rating system works. I'm willing to give one star for originality of the main idea and another for the acting not being too bad (mostly)but that's really about it. There were some really confusing plot elements - can I really get the FBI to come investigate something by merely telling them it's ""very serious"" and how the hell did that crap end up hidden in grandpa's barn for apparently 50 plus years with only a padlock and chain to keep E.T. out? The special effects were nothing special but could maybe warrant another half star for not being too poorly done, if only Amazon allowed it. Maybe found footage genre movies are supposed to have that element of rough around the edges, in order to keep it from looking too perfect. Maybe this genre should be graded for subtlety more than out and out fear inducement, but I was never scared, or even on edge,  and never felt compelled to question whether this was ""only a movie"" (unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tunnel/dp/B009FIN7CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tunnel</a>, another found footage style movie not from the major studios)  Now, don't misunderstand, I don't make movies, I don't write screenplays, I DO NOT feel like I could do any better. If this is someone's first attempt, then bravo, keep at it. At no time, however, did I feel this was a 5 star movie, and with the reviews already posted here, that's what I was expecting. See if you can rent it first, then if you agree with the majority opinion, by all means purchase it. If however you agree with me, then you're welcome.",1364515200,24,2129,4.735849056603773

After watching the movie I can only arrive at one of two conclusions--either of which makes this one of the best movies in this genre.  First, if the supposed ""found footage"" is indeed real then there is no doubt that extraterrestrial life exists.  On the other hand, if the film is simply nothing more than actors playing out their respective roles, then this is without a doubt one of the best directed and acted horror films of all time--they will have fooled me to be sure.  Regardless, the movie is a ""must see"" for anyone interested in the (non)existence of paranormal activity or for those who simply want to watch a top notch horror film.
