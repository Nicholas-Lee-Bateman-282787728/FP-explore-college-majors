8522796,3,B007X4ECRI,"This group of exercises is very nice, as Chris Coleman, the host. But there is no transcript of the exercises, so if you want to really use this DVD as a study tool, you must decipher every fill the drummers are playing. It's not very nice to be on your own. I don't think it is worth the money as study material, only as motivation and entertainment. I'm a little disappointed with this purchase.",1391040000,,397,4.378378378378378
