3116189,5,B0013LL2XY,"I just watched this online.  It was incredible!  I thought it was well written and directed.  This film offers an insightful and informative view into the world of birthing and the limited choices women have.  I would recommend to anyone, not just women of child bearing age, but anyone so that you can make an educated decision regarding the birth of your child.  It helps to know that a woman can do a natural birth if she has the support of others.  Too often, doctors and hospitals do not explain the effects of c sections on the mom and the baby.  It is not a celebrity trend that you should use to decide how you birth, learn about it for yourself.  You have to learn to read, to drive, watch this to learn about your options.  It is fantastic to have doctors available in emergencies, that is what they are there for, but to medicate a natural process? Not in my opinion, but this movie helps clarify these points in an open way, not negatively.",1203984000,15,952,4.394285714285714

3116199,1,B0013LL2XY,"This was the absolute worst movie I could've watched before giving birth to my son (who wound up being a c-section)... I'd hoped to have an ""all natural"" birth at the place in the documentary but the cost (several thousand $$) wasn't realistic and I had no choice but the hospital route. Well.. thank God I did that, thank God I got the epidural, the c-section, etc... The film helped me set false expectations & only increased my idealism surrounding this whole ""miraculous"" nutty crunchy event... by the time my own hodgepodge birth was over I felt like a complete failure... my son wouldn't breastfeed which only added to these feelings and I think movies like this, while informative, also just really set people up for disappointment and it's only 4 years later that it's dawning on me how absolutely ""non-failure-like"" I should've felt and would've felt.. had I NOT watched movies like this BEFORE giving birth!!!",1490832000,2,919,4.859872611464968

3116204,4,B0013LL2XY,This documentary gave a convincing argument for many of the 'pushes' being made concerning childbirth in the U.S. I could see people who fully support medical interventions for childbirth being put off and feeling this book was biased but I found it a great resource. Childbirth is a natural process but we treat it in the U.S. the way we treat illness. This creates a culture of fear surrounding labor instead of empowering women to feel confident. I wish they spent more time on scientific evidence and facts about how intervention cascades unfold during pregnancy and childbirth and less time on the personal stories but overall this was a great watch and I would recommend.,1488412800,,677,4.895652173913043

3116206,5,B0013LL2XY,"Explicit content of birthing babies and c-sections.  Not to be watched for the squeamish or at tender time (i.e. while eating).

Fascinating how in a time of feminism that more attention is not being drawn to such a personal and significant aspect of womanhood where currently decision-making is being taken away from women and placed in the hands of corporate profit-driven entities.  This subject needs more attention... and that was the point that movie drove home well.  Why do most consumers spend more time researching a restaurant, vacation, or car purchase more than who will be present and aid in the delivery of their children?",1485561600,4,637,5.038095238095238

3116214,5,B0013LL2XY,I actually decided to look into seeing a Midwife because of this movie. I changed from traditional medial doctor to seeing a Midwife.

I saw this documentary when I was in college, and from that day on I knew I wanted to see a midwife for my prenatal care/visits and delivery.

3116245,3,B0013LL2XY,"Provides a reasonable overview of the scope of the problem (that the birthing process has been unnecessarily medicalized in this country).

3116280,5,B0013LL2XY,This movie was recommended by my friend who was on the fence about natural birth. The movie helped both of us make informed decisions throughout our pregnancies. I ended up going to a midwife after watching the movie & they helped me deliver 2 healthy babies in the last 5 yrs. I was able to use epidural when needed but still experience natural delivery as the epidural wore off as my oldest started crowning. I still go to my midwives who are like family to this day for all my reproductive health & gynecologic needs. They advocated for me when I didn't have it in me at the hospital. I love watching this movie & I've recommended it to so many women.,1450137600,,654,4.368852459016393
3116281,5,B0013LL2XY,"What an eye opener! Dome may say this perspective is biased but I don't believe that. It is very well researched, documented & a compelling perspective to put mothers back in control of their deliveries. I showed this to 4 Physiology-anatomy classes  & 99% would choose natural birth. How many pregnant mothers even realize the rewards of natural delivery vs the chemical based rush of a 12 hour delivery into a ""convenient"" 20 minute slot that only benefits doctors & hospitals? And of course the higher risk of a c-section, which pays doctors & hospitals for a major surgery that shouldn't have been necessary. This is a ""must see"" for everyone who cares about mothers.",1448236800,,671,4.834782608695652

Had I seen this before having my own babies, I would have been terrified to deliver in a hospital. I actually had to pause the film and get some fresh air before finishing it; I was shaking!  Thank God this film was not around before I had kids. One child and I would not be alive today had I not been in a hospital for a completely unforeseen situation that occurred.

3116314,2,B0013LL2XY,"Apart from the content of the documentary, the film in and of itself is very repetitive and monotonous. You have a lot of different people saying the same thing over and over again.
The film makes some excellent points about birthing culture in the US. However, there is so much left out. Mainly, it leaves out a lot of the birthing process (with or without midwives) and does not address the impacts of litigation on birthing culture.
There was no scene showing the delivery of the placenta, suturing of vaginal tears, or dealing with post-postpartum hemorrhage (#1 cause of maternal death worldwide). In the majority of deliveries mothers have tears in their vaginas which the midwives suture right after the placenta is delivered. After the placenta is delivered the uterus has to be massaged in order ensure there in no hemorrhaging. If there is, the midwife will give intramuscular shot of pitocin to cause the uterus to contract which help control the bleeding. It's crazy to me that this birthing documentary leaves out the entirety of the birthing process just because the final parts are much less glamorous.
There was not a single mention of all the litigation experienced by obstetricians and how that has impacted the way babies are delivered. So much of the way medicine is practiced today is influenced by the growing amount of litigation against physicians in general. Defensive medicine. However, this is not discussed at all.",1439942400,6,1442,4.987551867219917
3116315,5,B0013LL2XY,A brilliant documentary! I love how it fairly covers both sides of the issue and shows the issues with hospitals and the medical industry in America without demonizing them.

3116348,1,B0013LL2XY,"My wife and I, having just given birth in a hospital, were very curious about what alternatives could have been taken.  This is not the documentary to give you adequate info.  It full of very one-sided arguments solely intended to promote the movie's agenda (at home births are better).  We had to turn off the movie part way through, as it presented dumpy music during med professional interviews, chose interviews from med professionals that made them seem clueless, and presented at home non-MD practitioners as saviors.  Don't get me wrong, the premise of this movie may have some merit, but the presentation was awful and irresponsible.

Do not use this movie as a primary source for deciding between at home and in hospital births!  Go talk to your local hospital to see the benefits vs the costs.",1438214400,8,803,4.824817518248175

Know what kind of birth you want & the true SAFE  options you have.

I found this video after so many questions about birth & seeing my friends' horrible birth experiences resulting in C-sections & learning that in the current city we were living in there was an 80% c-section rate! We no longer live there but it got me wondering if 80% of the women there really needed that c-section.  Plus I had plenty of friends who had safe, healthy natural births in both birthing centers & at home.

It got me thinking.  Then, I found this video & started doing my own research.

Two naturally, unmedicated vaginal births later (one with a hospital transfer but still vaginal w/ 6hr labor & natural & one birthing center water birth w/ 4.5hr labor), we are on our third pregnancy and planning a home birth (mostly because we don't think we will risk trying to make it to town this time).

Before you assume things, know your facts & know what is safe & what is not....watch this video & the other mini series called ""More on the Business of Being Born"" on Netflix.

My experiences & knowledge has helped several other moms in my area to do the actual research & choose to birth without epidural & at a birthing center or at home safely.

Again, watch, learn your true options & know it's your birth.....it should be in your control & you should know what is going on!!!!",1424476800,6,1528,4.402135231316726

You really do not need to watch a movie about how hospitals are in the business of money, not hopes and dreams. This movie does a great job of trying to get as many perspectives from medical professionals and non-medical professionals alike, to both disagree and agree with them. A woman who never sets foot in a hospital, does not get a bill from a hospital. The fear factor associated with giving birth naturally is apparent when you ask most American women or mothers who have given birth via c-section, after having no other issues up until the moment they were admitted to the hospital. The insurance companies do not make money if no one pays the premiums. Low-risk mothers are perfectly capable of giving birth with the what if factor lingering in the air. Women who fear giving birth will have a harder time giving birth. The most dangerous thing we do every day is drive a car. The whole natural birth thing strikes extreme fear in someone who has lost a loved one due to a car accident. Yet, we drive everyday. Our priorities are messed up. High-risk women need OB/GYNs.

3116635,2,B0013LL2XY,"There is nothing wrong with wanting a natural birth, whether at home, a birthing center, or a hospital. A good documentary would informed its viewers of the pro and cons of each decision and the circumstances under which a decision can be either good or bad. That is not the approach this film took. Have you watched a Michael Moore film? That's what my experience with this was like.

As other's have noted, it's biased. I would argue extremely biased. I will include information that the film should have presented, but didn't, for whatever reason.

The beginning of the film starts with statistics, namely that the US hospital birthing system is in crisis and that out of all the industrialized nations, the US has the worst infant mortality rate. Here's the problem with that statement, infant mortality is the wrong statistic to use when discussing birth. Perinatal mortality, or intranatal mortality is proper. Infant mortality is a measure of infant death starting anywhere from 1 week after birth to one month after birth until one year later. It is true that the US does not fare well, but that is due to the large underclass in this country (i.e., poor mothers, with poor health, and poor access to healthcare). When you exam perinatal mortality, the US is quite high; a lot higher than many of the European countries cited in the film (we are tied for 3/4 best according to WHO). Personally, I believe that the filmmaker and Rickie Lake (yes, she helped make this film) should have known that distinction, however, since it undercuts their point, I can see the motivation for the confusion. I would like to point this out since they film was wrong about it: the Netherlands has the second HIGHEST perinatal mortality rate in western Europe. They are NOT better that the US.

Regarding perinatal stats in the US, anyone can access this information. The CDC keeps track of it (search CDC Wonder) and you can compare the perinatal mortality for hospital born and home born children deliver by physicians, certified nurse midwives (CNM), and other midwives. The data are quite clear, the perinatal mortality for hospital born infants to either a physician or CNM are three times LOWER than a home birth with a typical midwife (0.57 per 1000 versus 1.73-2.06 per 1000). Another note about these numbers; if a complication arises at a home birth and you are transferred to the hospital and the infant or the mother dies/experiences some sort of morbidity, the stat is counted toward the hospital, not home birth. So these numbers likely underestimate the mortality and morbidity of home births and and overestimate them for hospital births, which already include most high-risk mothers.

This leads me another oversight on their part. They treat all midwives the same. They are not. As I mentioned above, there are certified nurse midwives and other midwives (typically licensed midwives (LM), certified professional midwives (CPM), and direct entry midwives (DEM)). The film points out that nearly 70% of European countries use midwives for births while the US only does it 8% of the time. They, then tie this in with infant mortality. I already established that infant mortality is misleading since factors not related to birth are the primary cause for that. What is also neglected is that the training of European midwives is vastly superior than for most American midwives. In the US we have two classes of Midwives, the CNM and the rest that I mentioned. Only the CNM are as qualified or more qualified than European midwives. CNM require a master's level training and, since they are actual nurses, they have medical training, just like the European midwives. The other types of midwives (DEM, LM, CPM) didn't even require a high school education until 2012! Also, many of these types were the study at home, take a test to get certification, types. If you plan on using a midwife, PLEASE only look at CNMs, as they have the training comparable to Europe's midwives. Also, CNM have connections to hospitals, so if a complication arises, they have access to proper facilities and don't have to rely on the ER. Of note, the perinatal mortality for CNM is comparable to physicians. Lastly, about this issues. by training, CNM (and the other midwives) only take on low-risk mothers. High risk are almost always handled at hospitals. The film neglects to mention this as well, and make it appears as if all women can and should have home births.

The film also mentions that maternal mortality is higher than many other industrialized nations, which is true. The film does not elaborate on why that is. The major causes of maternal mortality globally and in the US used to be due to hemorrhage, preeclampsia, and blood clots. These causes have been declining in this country for years now and are at their lowest rates. What is contributing to maternal mortality are PRE-EXISTING medical conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cardiomyopathy, etc as well as women getting pregnant in later life (which at age 35 is considered high risk by default). Again, this has nothing to do with where you give birth or who delivers your baby. The reality is there are no maternity intensivist and other resources devoted to handle the growing population of already sick pregnant women. In contrast, the perinatal mortality rate has dropped so much in this country because of the development of neonatology in the 1950s along with NICU's, etc.

Other misleading aspects include the showing of hospital scenes out of context. For example, to create the impression that the reason C-sections are so common in this country (33%) is because doctors don't want to wait for labor to run its course and to get as many mothers as possible in and out of the hospital to pad their bank accounts. While I'm sure there are some who do that, the idea that the majority of doctors are that ethically compromised and that the majority of midwives are ethically and morally superior is ridiculous. FYI, C-section is just as common in Europe as the US, so either those midwife using Europeans are just as financially motivated as US doctors, or the financial argument is a gross oversimplification of the issue. Also, in the US, the risk of complication for a vaginal birth is 8.6% while a C-section is 9.2%, a .06% difference, hardly the great evil the film portrays it to be. When it comes to wanting to avoid a C-section, education yourself of the legitimate, emergency situations that you need one so that you can direct your care. The same goes with the drugs that are administered during labor. The film presents a ""cascade"" of drugs that they suggest inevitably leads to a C-section. Again, if it were only that simple. FYI, pitocin is just oxytocin. It has the same effect on the body as the natural stuff. Like any externally administered drug, natural or otherwise, there are risk and benefits. Again, just know about the legitimate reasons to use it, such as when labor is stalled. Again, since the C-section is just as high in Europe, there is no mention of the same ""cascade"" practiced used there.

Much of the hospital births they show to make their points are actually of women who chose to INDUCE labor, hence the reliance on drugs, etc. What research shows is that induced labor reduces the incidence of C-section (just search for this article-Use of labour induction and risk of cesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis).

They also spend a lot of time of showing black and white clips and pictures of how barbaric medicine used to be. As if that barbarism reflects current understanding and practice. That would be like me showing clips of how mentally ill patients used to be treated with lobotomies, insulin injections, and hydrotherapy to critique contemporary mental health treatment. Just because things were bad, doesn't mean they still are bad.

The ultimate irony comes at the end. The filmmaker was pregnant during filming. Before she was in labor, she knew that her son was breached. She decided to try the home birth anyway. As you might predict, she needed an emergency C-section at a hospital in the ER and her son spent 3 weeks in the NICU before coming home.

I could go on. This is what you need to know. Decide what your birthing goals are. Then do your research. Then create a backup plan, if needed. Unfortunately, I would NOT recommend this film to anyone since it is so cherry picked and misleading. Many of the people in this film show the same arrogance and scientific ignorance as anti-evolution, anti-vaccination, anti-GMO, anti-climate change types. They all appeal to fear and distort the truth. There is just so much important information that could have easily been included if they skipped trying to scare the crap out of you.",1412121600,9,8790,4.869652406417113

It's so short sighted and mired in a bunch of bologna. If they believe the garbage that they can't deliver without a surgeon or can't give birth to their baby because it's bigger than 7lbs, why can't they also believe something else for a change and be a little more natural about it - or at least consider it. At the very least, educate yourself with many different lines of thinking and consider that all. Try using this documentary as just of a any tools for doing so.",1399334400,,643,4.235772357723577
3116736,5,B0013LL2XY,"I can see the strong argument for some of its shortcomings presented by the couple in another review, but for reaching a wider audience with its powerful message, I couldn't give this film any less than 5 stars.  I'd heard it referenced in the past few years but didn't search it out until my partner and I began to make plans to grow our family.  My first trips to doctors to address what may or may not be conditions impacting my pregnancy and childbirth were astonishing.  The doctor who quite literally laughed in my face when I told him of my hope to deliver naturally (unmedicated), and asked why I'd want to put myself through that ""pain and suffering""!!  He then impressed upon me that I should abandon all hope of even a vaginal delivery from any private practice doctor, since the cesarean rate was now up to 45% in the US.  And then he explained why, with absolutely no trace of shame.  I was floored and sought out to make the case for my body and my baby.
This film appears to be a very good first stop.  It has opened plenty of areas for further research and helped fueled my conviction that I have a responsibility to advocate for myself and my child in a system wrought with serious problems.  Thanks to the filmmakers for this powerful film.  Oh, and incidentally, unlike for some other reviewers, I have no problem with the often-appearance of those women in the film.  The subject couldn't be more personal and I think the case if made stronger by their personal experience with it.

My four children were born between the years 1969 and 1982 and though I am a nurse and was vaguely aware of care delivery options and changes extending into obstetrics, this documentary was a sad shock.....our lives move on and I assumed much had at least stayed the same-not regressed! Lamaze, minimally assisted delivery, and home births should be options, a mom's choice, and supported by the medical community!

I think many hospital birthing centers have improved in their policies so it really depends on the hospital that you are using.  Homebirth probably is a great option for many but I feel like this video doesn't give the disadvantages of home birth or the risks that apply there.  Childbirth in the US definitely needs improvement but I'm not sure if home birth is the key.

3116769,1,B0013LL2XY,"Beware this video, or any saying how easy or great natural childbirth is. It appears to be factual and well balanced but it hides some really important facts. My wife just attempted a home-birth after watching this video, $4000 later plus a lot of extreme pain we did a 30 minute hospital transfer with my wife screaming in agony the whole way to the hospital. Here are the things that we learned during our birthing experience which aren't covered in any of the videos in this series:-

i) Midwives are not legally allowed to administer pain medication, other than cannabis which doesn't even touch the intense pain,
so even if you have a really relaxed you may still experience a lot of pain which could be treated in a hospital.

ii) Midwifes can't always turn the baby even though they will tell you that they can.

iii) Using an epidural actually can help the cervix dilate as well as greatly reducing the pain. This was a big one for us because just staying at home with the midwife natural birth just wouldn't have been possible but it would have been in a hospital.

iv) Hospitals these days really do try to help mothers have a natural childbirth in relaxed settings rather than leaping to C-sections but they have the advantage of proper medical backup if needed. Again this was a big surprise, we used Kaiser, from this video we expected to be rushed to the operating room at 10pm.

v) The higher instance of C sections and mortality in hospitals is because midwives cherry-pick the easiest births, also the midwife failures end up in hospital and count as part of the hospital statistics.",1391126400,14,1600,4.639575971731449

A must see for women before they give birth and a great movie for women who had a birth they did not like or for women who want to do it differently next time.

We both found it to be a fresh take on the journey of being pregnant as well as the process of delivery.  I personally appreciated that an alternate viewpoint is presented without sacrificing substantial evidence for and against each choice of delivery. I must say that I have to agree with the storyline of the film completely.  Currently 8 months pregnant, I have witnessed both sides of this argument.  I started with a traditional OBGYN as my care provider in early pregnancy and often felt that I was being rushed as well as kept in the dark during my appointments.  Never, did I feel well taken care of.  My recent switch to a certified Midwife brings an entirely new excitement and anticipation to birth.

For just about any other movie, I would have given up because I was SO irritated and frustrated.  But this movie was worth all that hair-pulling aggravation.  Having studied, for over 12 years, brain development from prenatal through infancy through the lens of traumatic events, I can assure anyone that babies DO remember - via implicit memory (vs explicit), and there is an astounding amount of trauma that is inflicted on the baby in the process of medicalized childbirth.  Trauma is also inflicted on the mother to a lesser extent, but all these traumas interfere monumentally with the bonding process which is so critical for creating healthy brain pathways in infants.  Dr. Michel Odent (French obstetrician featured in the film) can tell you about these traumas in detail, and his work is worth studying for those who wish to know more.  Highly recommended.

I think for women who are planning on having a natural birth in a hospital setting and are comfortable with your doctors...this movie will give you second thoughts and make you question your decision.  That is not an ideal situation when labor is right around the corner.  It does make you question the trust you have in your healthcare providers.  As a healthcare provider, I welcome questions and feedback from the healthcare consumers I serve and I believe my doctors value that as well.

3116838,5,B0013LL2XY,"So, I watched this movie.  I have read a number of the 1 star reviews and checked out one movie recommended there - Childbirth Without Violence.  But everyone on Netflix was either creeped out or very bored by that movie.

What astounded me in this movie was that women could actually have babies without intense screaming and agony and wailing and begging for pain medicine.  Childbirth was always portrayed to me as awful and ungodly painful.  It didn't sound like anything I would ever be capable of.  But the women at home just had the babies very fast.  Whoosh!  And a baby is there!  With a 2 year old walking around in the background!  No screaming and no torture.  No failing arms and pushing.  Just a baby right there!  It was easy!

I DO think women need to see THAT regardless of anything ELSE in the movie.  Because that IS empowering.  Yes, we CAN have children ourselves.  The doctor is NOT the one having the child for us.  And I do think the fact that the film maker had to go to the hospital just showed that the midwives DO work well with the hospital system.

I'm amazed how angry people are about this.  Calling the film maker names?  Why can't midwives be good for some things and doctors for others?  Midwives were stamped out in the 30s.  We never hear of them now.  So a movie in favor of them is needed.  What's to get all wound up about?  I don't get it.  I think the doctors can protect themselves just fine!  :-)  They aren't going out of business anytime soon.",1378166400,2,1489,4.3713235294117645

It is easy to get scared away from hospitals and medical intervention from highly passionate information and work such as this this, and if easily influenced, this video will make you feel that natural-birthing is the only way to go, so just keep a mindful perspective and be open and honest with your medical practitioners about your questions and concerns if you are one of those people that worries a lot after being presented with new and at-times frightening statistics and case studies etc.",1376265600,,815,4.898550724637682

3116844,5,B0013LL2XY,"Thank you Ricki Lake and Abby Epstein for making this most amazing documentary.  It is an eye opener.  If you have been healthy and haven't learned how the medical system processes you like chicken, you need to learn how your choices are being removed from the most natural experience you can have.

Unlike some reviewers, I think this was a very accurate portrayal about how the medical community sees your childbirth experience as a money making venture.  Like so many things wrong in our medical care, we spend so much in the U.S. and yet, the level of care received is subpar.

Consider these scary statistics covered in this film; nearly 95% of all births in the U.S. are now scheduled Caesareans while 5% are natural childbirth.  This is the reverse of Great Britain, Norway, Switzerland, Netherlands, France, Germany and Japan and a few other Industrial nations.  Our infant mortality in the U.S. is very high, higher than ANY Industrial nation and worse than some 3rd world nations.  Why?  Because, the doctors find doing so is easier for them.  One fact showed that across the NYC metro area, the highest incidence of Caesarians occurred at 4:00pm and 10:00pm.  The conclusion they came to was that Doctors want to get home and have dinner and 10:00pm is that the doctors consider the labor may go into the night and they want their sleep.  Gee, hate to inconvenience y'all being that you are so important, after all it is only a new precious life and the mom's well being at stake.

The more Caesareans preformed the greater risk of complications for mother.  Again, who cares right?

When the dozen or so the Gynecologists/OBGYN doctors were interviewed only one had witnessed a non-induced birth.  It is not a part of the curriculum in Medical Schools, shame on the medical community!  How appalling that what has existed for 10,000 years has been phased out in 100 years.  The doctor, who had witnessed natural childbirth was an advocate of it.  He is back-up to at least one Midwife.

I worked in the insurance industry for several years and was outspoken at the frustration I experienced at a well-known HMO that gave doctors act like God.  Some actually do, they absolutely drive the choices in the health care system (or better stated, the lack there of).  When the one female doctor said that her mentor told her when in doubt do a C-section because no one will question you, I found that very disturbing and revealing.  My sister was an intensive care neo-natal nurse and an intensive care cardiology nurse in major regional hospitals.  The horror stories I heard makes me a believer that this is the thought process for many doctors.  Furthermore, the insurance companies will stall claims for those who have natural childbirth even when it is pre-approved (boy, did I see that during my career - it made me so angry I left to went to work for a Fortune 100 company to manage their healthcare plans.  Though it averages $10,000 less in cost to use a Midwife compared to an average delivery in a hospital setting ($14,000 in 2008) because the insurance companies bow to the AMA pressure, they are causing financial hardship on the Midwife community.  Many have chosen to go out of business than fight with the insurance companies over payment, in fact, it is so bad, many can't afford to keep their doors open because all the staff they require to handle billing.

While one reviewer complains that New York City doesn't reflect smaller communities; no one can argue that NYC sets the trends for many different communities over time. I live in a large metro area and a birthing center that was open when I moved here more than 25 years ago, just recently closed.  There are only two in a Metro Area which consists of more than 1 million people!

One of the saddest things is that the drugs put additional stress on the baby's heart.  When women asked what the risks were they were given flippant non-specific words like ""low or minimal"".  When a woman is in crisis she is going to trust the expert, e.g. the doctor.  Furthermore, the main drug used blocks the release of natural hormones which occurs at the time of delivery.  The hormonal cocktail has oxytocin (the same chemical released at orgasm).  This chemical causes a natural high for Mom through the release of endorphins (which help the mom recover from the pain) and it also is found to be a strong bonding mechanism that gives rise to a protective instinct for the newborn's safety and needs.  One question raised, is what happens when those chemicals aren't released?  Some women, who had both natural and induced labor state there is a huge difference in their interactions with their child.

One thing the video didn't explore much was the impact on the father's to be able to empathize with the woman at the time of labor and delivery.  All men were very excited but imagine the difference you experience witnessing the birth of your child at home!  This is a very big moment for him as well.  The same experience isn't had in an operating room, no one can argue that.",1375056000,,5053,4.703071672354949

3116874,5,B0013LL2XY,"I absolutely love and enjoyed this movie to the max, and I highly recommend it to anyone that is expecting a child or know someone that is. The United States is truly in the midst of a ""birthing crisis"", where many medical professionals treat pregnancy as a disease, or rather, a condition that needs treatment. Not as a completely natural event that all women are completely capable of handling...if given the chance! We were born with the innate knowledge of birthing our offspring, if we let our instincts guide us, instead of an OB/Gyn that will make every attempt to control your pregnancy and your birth. Letting the OBs intervene even once, as they also pointed out in this amazing movie, will cause a snow-ball effect of never ending interventions, and you WILL lose control of your own birth without even realizing it.
Bottom line, this movie will guide you through our current shambles of a birthing community and you will walk away with more knowledge then you ever thought would be necessary to know. It's your body...shouldn't you know everything about ""The Business of Being Born"" before trusting yourself blindly to an OB and going with everything that they say?

3116892,3,B0013LL2XY,"I had an emergency c-section with my first son because he wasn't tolerating labor. I received an epidural after being in labor for 14 hours.  I just couldn't tolerate the pain any more.  I was having major contractions (the nurse said the intensity was what they would expect when women are at 8cm), but they weren't doing anything to dilate my cervix.  When my son's heartbeat started declining, they suggested I have an epidural to relax me.  They suspected that because I was bracing myself during every contraction that I was not relaxed enough to let the contraction do its job, and it was causing stress to my son.  Fifteen minutes after getting the epidural, I had an adverse reaction to it.  My blood pressure crashed, and my son's oxygen levels started declining as did his heart rate.  Once they got me stabilized, they tried to do some things to stabilize my son, but they didn't work.  So I ended up with an emergency c-section.  He had the cord wrapped around his neck several times, and the low amniotic fluid (my water broke at 1cm) wasn't providing any cushion to the cord.  They suspected he was trapped in the pelvis, and that is why my cervix wasn't dilating past 5 cm.

Fast forward a couple of years....When I got pregnant with my second son, I investigated all of my options starting with this video.  While I think it's important to understand the history of obstetrics in our country, I was a little disappointed in the slant of this video.  It was not objective - in my opinion.  It portrays all doctors and hospitals as money-grubbing facilities that only want to get you in and out much like a fast food establishment.  While they did show a lady who ended up at the hospital after her stay-at-home birth didn't pan out, their intent was to focus on how awesome  home birth can be.  They make it sound like any woman should consider home birth.  Well...I don't think so.  After researching all of my options, I elected for a repeat c-section.  I am very happy I chose that way for my son to be born.  The things that happened with my first son also happened during the birthing process of my second son.  I had an adverse reaction to the epidural.  My second son was slightly bigger than my first, and my doctor told me that my second son could not fit through my pelvis, which was why I had been in labor off / on for a couple of days.  They suspected my pelvis was too small with my first, but since I had other complications they weren't 100% sure that was the reason he wasn't tolerating labor.  If I had chosen to give birth at home or a birthing center, there is a very real chance that my son would have gotten stuck in my pelvis and died.  I could have died.  If I would have listened to this video, I would have mistrusted my doctor when he said he would not recommend a VBAC due to the complications in my first birth.

Unfortunately I have a friend who had a c-section with her son because he was failing to thrive.  When she got pregnant with her daughter, she researched things as I had done.  She had 3 different doctors that told her they would not do a VBAC because of the risk since her first son was failure to thrive.  So she decided to go to a birthing center and use a midwife.  Right before she was supposed to start pushing, they lost the baby's heartbeat.  She ended up at the hospital and delivered a stillborn daughter.  If she had trusted her doctors, she would have been holding her daughter instead of planning a funeral.

Are some of the statistics they present in this video accurate?  Yes.  But keep in mind that just because there is a correlation doesn't mean that it is the cause.  For instance, more ice cream is bought in warmer months.  Warmer months don't cause increased consumption of ice cream.  It's just a correlation.  They are related, but they are not cause and effect.",1367020800,10,3843,4.4406294706723894
3116893,5,B0013LL2XY,"I would consider this documentary educational, interesting and moving. Anyone expecting or considering pregnancy should watch it. Though as many of the VERY heated comments explain it is biased. If you are someone who lets one movie shape the rest of your life and you base everything you know upon that, without doing any other research then that is your mistake. I do believe home birth or even unmedicated birth isn't talked about as much as it should be and this documentary obviously did a lot to get women talking. I don't believe it is untruthful or unnecessarily bashes doctors but more explains the American birthing system, most of which is true. Personally I believe any medication, when not necessary, is simply that, unnecessary. I don't pop a pill every time i get a stomach ache or my head hurts nor should you opt for a c-section when unnecessary. It is not my personal choice to give birth to my baby in my living room with my other children watching but I would never slam a mom who does. I am a high risk pregnancy and so I will give birth in a hospital but under my birth plan. There is nothing wrong with monitoring my baby and myself while I labor AND doing so unmedicated, and this is my plan. There is also nothing wrong with me or my doctor if a c-section absolutely has to be preformed. Im not going to beat myself up about it either way. Educate yourself, watch this documentary and many others, read all the books and make up your own mind at the end of the day. Lets not be irrational people. Everyone leaving negative comments is making themselves look just as bad and biased as they believe the movie to be. If you don't agree, don't watch it, and don't give a bad rating because ""it wasn't what you expected"" that is completely unhelpful to anyone educated enough to read the description.",1366675200,2,1820,4.5181818181818185

3116912,5,B0013LL2XY,"The Business of Being Born is a documentary made in 2008 by Ricki Lake and Abby Epstein. Inspired by her own birth experiences, celebrity Ricki started to educate herself about birth through every avenue possible. Her friend and film maker, Abby, came along side her in the process and they produced this film together to share what they learned about birth, maternity care, obstetrics and midwifery in the United States.

The Business of Being Born includes many interviews by professionals including OB/GYNs, midwives, nurse midwives, mothers, fathers and doulas. Ricki shares her birth experiences and how she chose to have a home birth with her second baby. Abby and Ricki also follow a nurse midwife Care around and film two home births with her as attendant. One is of a first time mother who shares how she arrived at choosing a home birth and another of a second time mother's water birth. Cara is calm, competent, insightful and sheds a lot of light on the subject of birth and midwifery in NYC and the U.S. at large. If your used to birth as shown in Call the Midwife, this documentary will feel very raw and real-- nothing is left out. A cesarean section is also shown which can be shocking for anyone who has not seen one before.

My most favorite component of the documentary is that they put the history of birth in perspective. How we ended up where we are is vital to understanding the current state of things. I highly recommend Deliver Me from Pain if you are interested in more history on midwifery, birth and how, why, and when obstetrical interventions were invented.

I witnessed this film hit the shelves and create ripples all through out the birth community, and the world at large really, as many unfamiliar with birth and modern maternity care watched the film, some with awe and others plain shock.

I personally enjoy and appreciate the documentary for this very reason. The Business of Being Born starts at the bottom and works up for those who are unfamiliar with current birth practices and politics. And guess what, that is nearly everyone! The importance of knowing what is going on in the hospital near you is vital to a safe and good birth experience. Hospitals offer services to expectant families and we should know the facts in order to make wise decisions as consumers. What doctors, midwives and hospitals do is not the same all across the board. If everyone was practicing evidence based care, all doctors and midwives would be doing the same thing the entire world over! That is certainly not the case. The fact that doctors and midwives don't agree shows that some are practicing evidence based medicine and some are not, and all have their reasons for doing so. Is it money? Is it politics? Is it tradition? I am not saying one way or the other but I think it is worth thinking about.

 I love that Ricki and Abby stuck their necks out there and said some things that would make people mad for the sake of opening people's eyes to the reality of what is going on close to home. Ricki and Abby use current statistics to compare the U.S. to rest of the developed world-- and the U.S. doesn't do very well! For many, this is a huge shocker as our culture has a lot of faith in doctors and hospitals. To think that faith is not substantiated is hard.

Many people didn't like the fact that statistics were shared saying that it was placing fear where it did not belong and scaring people into not using hospitals. This documentary is meant to be a launching pad to get people thinking. Choices cannot be made based solely on the views and facts presented in this film nor should choices be made without this view, I believe. If, in the back of your mind you wonder if the cesarean section rate is really 30%+ and climbing or if cesarean sections are really as safe as vaginal births or if the US ranks at #41 for infant mortality, look it up! In the end, peoples opinions will just be their opinions and viewing this documentary will be a waste of your time if we do not research for ourselves and come to our own conclusion that we feel confident with. I recommend other resources like The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth, A Good Birth, A Safe Birth and The Heart and Science of Home Birth (Check my ""favorite resources"" tab for more!) for more information on obstetrical interventions, birth settings and maternity care providers. It is so important to have a well rounded education based on unbiased facts before making a decision.

In conclusion, I love Business of Being Born for introducing anyone to birth, why I do what I do and why it is such a passion of mine. It is concise, well made, and gripping. If you have never watched a movie about birth before, this is the one I would start with.",1359331200,,4750,4.58

Infant Mortality is the death of an infant within the first year of life. This is a reflection of Pediatric Care, not Obstetric Care.

Perinatal Mortality Rates would be the accurate statistic to use. It calculates deaths from 28 weeks gestation through the first week postpartum. This would be a true reflection of obstetrical and/or midwifery care in the United States.

When someone purposefully uses misleading statistics to make their point, they are essentially lying to you. It doesn't matter what field it is regarding, whether politics, law, or medicine.

I'm not saying all women should give birth in a hospital. The mother should do what is right for her and her family and should be informed before making her choice.

What I am saying is that this video should not be used as a source of that information/education.",1350864000,31,875,4.965753424657534

No matter where you are in the world, issued raised in this DVD are crucial to understand and see with your very own eyes if you want a better birth experience. It is a lengthy film and could probably be condensed a little, but as a fellow birth advocate I understand that there is so much to say and so much you want everyone to know before they head into birth completely unaware of whats going on in the birth industry.

Makes for a great gift for friends expecting a baby too - spread the love as far and wide as you can. Its hard to get a birth film into the mainstream when there's not alot of money being spent on keeping birth safe and normal, so it needs as much support as we can give it.",1350172800,,749,4.095238095238095

my options are.  And that's all this video is, it gives you some more options that you may not know you had.

3116993,5,B0013LL2XY,"This shines a light on the history of birthing in the U.S.  It's NOT what you might think.  There were some VERY dark times in the history of ""medicalized"" birth, once the hospitals took over what was normally a natural process.  It's a good thing that hospitals are around today because some pregnancies have complications, especially if the mother already has an illness of some kind.  Still, this scenario is the exception rather than the rule.  Most babies can be born at home, and they still are in other countries around the world.  In the U.S., birthing, as most everything else comes down to money.  That's how having babies moved into the hospital system.

This film covers that history but also follows several women through their decisions to have a home birth.  When you learn of the insane catch-22 spiral that hospitals create with alternating epidural/pitocin treatments that ultimately end in a C-section, you'll get infuriated.  At other times, you'll cry with joy at the beauty of the birthing segments.  This film is quite an education and is highly recommended.",1346457600,5,1081,4.95

My son would have been a still born 100 years ago. You think it will never happen to you until it does. I became that statistic that needed the ""medicalized"" birth and thank god for it. Otherwise I would still be mourning the loss of my son and not just the loss of my idealized birth plan.

3117050,4,B0013LL2XY,"I guess if I was able to get pregnant, or had a friend who was, I'd give this five stars. It's all about natural birth, specifically home birth, midwives and the comparison to hospital births.

Some shocking statistics: the US has the lowest rate of midwife-assisted births of any country, and also the worst infant mortality rate of any developed country. It has been proved over and over again that normal vaginal birth is lots safer for both mother and baby, but the incidence of caesarian section is up to like one-third of all births.

Mothers (especially famous women) are having caesarians because it's convenient. You can schedule your birth around the shooting schedule for your next film. You can get a tummy tuck at the same time as the caesarian, so you get your figure back in a hurry. But there are a lot of dangerous chemicals used in hospitals to induce labor, then to cope with the consequences of that drug, then . . . but you get the idea.

Statistics suggest that some of these drugs may be linked to ADHD and related neurological disorders in kids. They also can screw up the mother/child bonding process.

Another ironic fact is that insurance companies are down on natural birth. This is especially weird when it costs so much less. Maybe it's just that they have OB/GYN advisers when they set their policies, and so there's a disincentive to help them see midwives -- no matter how well trained and qualified -- as valid health care providers.

The best part of the film is that we get to see several home births, and also a couple of hospital births. We get to know the parents and the babies, and the whole thing will have you scratching your head about why the US statistics on child birth are so screwed up.",1336694400,3,1735,4.565916398713826

Even if you think this particular presentation of the information is one-sided, it raises some very important questions and doubts about the effect the mainstream, U.S. medical establishment has had on the most original and natural process in the world.  This is not only about birthing options, but also about the general brain-washing by huge, powerful institutions in all aspects of our lives.  Historical, factual information proves we have been told time and again by organizations such as the FDA, that particular foods, drugs, and chemicals are safe, when in fact they were not.  Like anything else in life, the decision of how and where to deliver should be carefully researched and thoughtfully planned according to the informed and educated choices of the families involved.",1335139200,,935,5.25503355704698

I finally bought the DVD because on the appropriate occassions when I talk about it to others, they immediately want to see it. Now I can share it with them. I watched it for the first time after having my daughter in a local hospital. Although I was able to deliver her naturally with the help of a doula and an awesome nurse I lucked into getting when I was admitted, I still faced the uphill battle of ensuring the natural outcome I so wanted for both me and my daughter because of all the medical interventions readily available at the hospital. This is a homebirth heavy documentary, but because it follows a midwife who only delivers in homes, I don't know how they could have gotten away from that aspect. Nevertheless, I have found it to be a good tool that can be used in conjunction with other tools, e.g. birth classes, doulas, books, etc., to help women make truly informed decisions about their birth experience--no matter what that decision is.

Out of all my friends almost all of them were induced, had pitocin, and ended up with csections. (I had a csection as well)This movie empowered me to fight for my VBAC, which was a long uphill battle. I would encourage any pregnant woman to watch this film and research for her own benefit before you go into the hospital and do everything that the good nurses and doctors tell you to.",1330128000,2,619,4.391304347826087
3117127,5,B0013LL2XY,"The title of this DVD nailed it. Giving birth in the US is a money making business. I had an EXCELLENT pregnancy (my first one) at age 33. I was full of energy, worked out until the last day I gave birth, etc. I had a ""good"" OB/GYN whom I went to during my 9 months. Of course the day I went into labor (I was 10 days over my due date) he was out of town (he wanted to induce me, but I said NO! I had a gut feeling I was gonna go into labor naturally and I did). The back-up doctor (monster) we had was a MORON!!!! To make a long story short, everything that was shown in this DVD, we went thru. The minute we got to the hospital the MORON was pressuring me to get the epidural. I was afraid since it's a scary procedure and there is always that 1% chance a patient ends up paralyzed. I held out as long as I could and endured the pain until I couldn't take it anymore, so I got the epidural. I was pretty much left in the labor room alone (i.e. only my hubby and my mom) but the MORON of the doctor barely even came in. I felt like I was pinned to the bed, and a slave to the doctor's and nurses orders. I imagined my labor to be as smooth as my pregnancy was. Not even close! Mind ya, I was FULLY dilated, my water broke on its own at the hospital, yet the nurses took their precious time to fuss around. Like they purposely did not inform me what was going on so that they can prolong the labor and perform a C-section on me. My mom, who was in the room with us and gave birth twice in her life without any epidural, she knew what was going on. She even got pissed off when she saw my monitor and the contractions were literally a minute apart and I was left in the room without any help. When the MORON doctor FINALLY decided to show up after I was in labor for close to 10 hours now, all he did was flip me around in all sorts of positions, not even giving me a chance to push (although giving birth with an epidural you can't feel any contractions), but that's when the doctor is supposed to HELP the patient in letting me know when to push. Duh! He just stood there and then leaned over to me and whispered into my ear ""I am sorry but we have to do a C-section"". I WAS BEYOND PISSED!!!!! The hospital also IGNORED my birthing plan, I asked NOT to have anyone else in the room besides my hubby and my mom, which was ignored. Over 20 med students came in gawking over me while I was in distress. Needless to say I was wheeled out into the OR, crying, screaming and BEGGING the nurses and the doctor NOT to do this. At this point I was so pissed off, that I didn't even care about the pain anymore, and I was determined to show this doctor he will NOT make money off of me! Sure enough at this point on, I was NOT gonna be treated like another $$$ sign and didn't even give a damn who was telling me what to do. With the little sensation I had below my waist from the epidural, when I felt a contraction coming on (oh and mind ya, I was already being prepped for a C-section), but I turned on my side and I pushed so hard that sure enough I gave birth NATURALLY. You should have seen the look on the MORON's face that he didn't end up doing his C-section on me.

That night, there were 4 other women who gave birth (I was the fifth one), and they ALL had C-sections. Now you tell me, do you honestly believe that all 4 of those women had complications??? I think not!

The title of this DVD can't be any more right!!!! Giving birth in America IS a business. The reason C-sections are on the rise because it's more money in the doctors pocket, less time they have to waste with each patient and less of a chance for a lawsuit if the woman gives birth naturally. Period.

Of course the doctors will come up with some lame excuse that the baby is in ""danger"" and what woman would not wanna believe it. My baby was NOT breech, her head was clearly crowning, yet the doctor wanted a C-section. Are you kidding me???

I have very low tolerance for pain, that is why I know I could not give birth at home, but one thing for sure, before my nightmare of a labor, my husband and I planned on having two kids. But now, we don't ever wanna go thru this horrible ordeal again! The doctor literally robbed us of what was supposed to be a wonderful experience.

I think this DVD is a MUST see for every woman who plans on getting pregnant and giving birth. And any woman who thinks will have this fairytale labor, yeah, think again! The minute you walk into a hospital, no breathing techniques, Pilates ball nonsense, candle lights, will get you thru when there is a doctor with $$$ on his mind.

Natural births in this country will be a thing of the past!

It is an eye-opener on the stuff they make you go thru in a hospital, maybe not in every hospital, but the majority in America. Healthy young/women should not be forced to have C-sections!!!",1329782400,9,4838,4.07563025210084

I'm sure there have been plenty of wonderful births both in the hospital and at home.. but what experience am I truly interested in? This is the question that I walked away with. I do not think I want a homebirth for my first, so I started researching the hosptials in the Baltimore, MD area which offered more of a 'birthing center' atmosphere. I found only one (Mercy) that has listed on the website multiple delivery options, such as the ability to walk around, eat during labor, and have the choice of a water birth. This surprised me.

3117175,2,B0013LL2XY,"I knew this film would be one-sided, but I was very interested in seeing the particular side that was portrayed since I had a medicated hospital birth with my first and I'm currently pregnant with my second. However, I could not believe how angry I got at some of the conclusions that were drawn about women who give birth in a hospital. The worst part was when one man inferred that women who are medicated during birth or have c-sections don't have the proper hormones to love their children. Are you kidding me? Also it was inferred that women who have hospital births don't experience the joy and beauty of birth. I personally had a wonderful experience in a hospital. I know that there are horror stories that come from hospital births, but this film makes it seem as though they are all that way. I experienced quite a bit of pain before my epi so it's not like I missed out on that. I also felt no pressure from any of the staff or doctors to do anything I didn't want to do. And then the moment my sweet child was put on my chest, I couldn't do anything but thank the Lord and cry tears of joy. How on earth could this have been any sweeter? Just because I wasn't in a tub in my living room? I had my precious son! Anyway, I am all for natural birth, home birth, unmedicated birth, etc if that's what you want. But I don't think that women who have the same mountaintop experiences in hospitals have missed out on one ounce of joy. And why didn't the filmmakers talk about unmedicated births in a hospital?

3117178,4,B0013LL2XY,"I found The Business of Being Born to be very informative and definitely worth watching, I highly recommend it. I have only a couple complaints:

1. A bit of nudity towards the end, my husband and I would've appreciated more modesty. I've had one hospital birth, two home-births, with a third at the end of this year. I can therefore say with some measure of authority that it's not necessary to walk around topless or nude. Yes, birth is perfectly natural. So is sex, urination, and defecation. I'm not going to do any of those on screen.

2. I like home-birth because it feels so right, I have no other way to explain it. I'm a major advocate for home-birth, but what I can't stand is the ""movement"" associated with it. I do the home-birth because it's better for the child being born, the rest of the family, as well as myself (barring an emergency comes up, obviously). It's about mommy and baby, not ""empowerment"" and ""I am woman, hear me roar"". It's irritating and, in my opinion, it degrades women who choose to home-birth.",1322697600,,1030,4.562162162162162

However, after seeing the entire movie, I am happy I did.  It is certainly worth a view.  The video shows several home-births.  That in and of itself was informative.  It also spurred on more research for the Pitocin use for non-induced patients.  That was rather alarming to me.  It also allowed me to vocalize some concerns that I have and had about inductions.  The film does not go into additional options for child birth rather than the home-birth and medical hospital birth.  It would have been nice to learn about options for those that can not have a home birth.  I am in that category and as a result of this film and further research, I have decided to hire a doula.",1321401600,,821,4.523809523809524
3117182,5,B0013LL2XY,"I love this film.  Is it biased?  Of course.  It was made as a response to Ricki Lake's birth experiences, in the hospital and at home.  It is about stories.  Not to mention it's a rare view into alternative birthing options.  I saw this for the first time when I was training to be a doula.  It inspired me to get more information and what I found was shocking.  I never realized how the medicalization of birth was so closely tied to the eugenics movement.  And how granny midwives in the south were eliminated by medicare and the cultural association of home birth=poverty.  So to be fair, the film could have been much more biased.

I also thought it was poignant that Epstein had an emergency c-section.  I felt it really shows that obstetric interventions can truly be life saving when used with discretion.  While medical advancement has caused numerous setbacks, it also truly a blessing.  In addition, Epstein never fully seemed sold on the idea of a home birth.  Her conversations with the midwife talk about potential transfer to a birthing center.  Every woman is different and every birth will be different.  And women should be given education, resources, and options to find what works best for them.

I encourage women to not use a 90 minute documentary to decide your birth plan; however, this is an excellent place to get a ""most births don't require a hospital"" view and an excellent place to start further research.  I have truly enjoyed the educational journey that this documentary inspired, and I hope that it is the beginning of empowerment for a multitude of women regardless of where or how you give birth.",1320969600,3,1632,4.723404255319149

3117234,1,B0013LL2XY,"In my opinion the creators of this DVD are either grossly misinformed or pushing an agenda. I was absolutely repulsed by the amount of bashing of the US Medical System in this DVD.

The final straw for me was when the creators repeated an often used and misleading ""statistic"" regarding infant mortality rates in the United States compared to other countries around the world. The same type of propaganda that we saw coming out during the ramming through of Obamacare. All done to make the best healthcare system in the world look like a failed third world system based solely on profit without any regard for the patient.

Every country has their own rating system regarding infant mortality and it is impossible to compare these ratings between different countries because they simply are not the same.

As an example: Most of the European Union does not include babies born before 26 weeks as ""live births"" into their statistics. Switzerland does not include any baby born under 30cm in length as a ""live birth"" and Germany and Canada do not include any babies born under one pound as a ""live birth"".

Many of the industrialized nations which boast some of the lowest infant mortality rates like France, Hong Kong and Japan do not include babies that die within the first 24 hours of birth as ""live births"" (Half of reported US infant deaths occur within the first 24 hours). All of these ""exceptions"" help to suppress the infant mortality rates of other countries substantially.

In comparison, the United States has a much more encompassing set of standards for the category of ""live birth"". The United States includes ALL babies born with ANY signs of life irrespective of weight or size into the category of ""live births"".

3117238,5,B0013LL2XY,"I happened upon this documentary in the midst of wrestling with my decsision for healthcare when I have a baby.  I am only in the preconception stage, but I think it's very important to do research and know the options.  For many reasons I lean towards a traditional hospital birth, probably because it's the norm here in the U.S.  However, I really see nothing wrong with the homebirth as long a knowledgeable, experienced midwife is present.  For me though, I don't think I would choose a homebirth, but I do want natural, no drugs, no doctor pushiness, and the least amount or artificial intervention.  I would prefer a Certified Nurse Midwife at a hospital location.  Whatever your choice, I think this film does an excellent job of illustrating why maternity care has become a scary and unnatural experience instead of a natural, loving one.
To address some of the negative reviews, this film does not ""demonize"" women that choose not to have a home birth. That kind of thinking is produced solely from a closed minded, ignorant perspective, as is the validity of whether or not it's Rikki Lake or some other journalist producing this film.  I appreciated it for the knowledge it gave me that I couldn't gain from just a book or watching ""A Baby Story"" on TLC.  Ever notice how many C-sections and epidurals they dole out on that show?  When in such a vulnerable position, it's easy to see how woman are persuaded by ""the expert"" at a hospital to hurry the process through artificial means.  I believe armed with the facts well before that time, women will be in a better position to make the right choices for themselves and their child.  If you value learning and seeing the different situations from homebirth to an unplanned C-secition in a hospital, watch this film!

This is a completely one sided documentary. It presents a lot of opinions as though they are facts, and seems to try to demonize women for making the choice to have a ""traditional"" hospital birth.

That being said I do think women should be educated about the processes and facts of giving birth, which this film sort of does. In a totally biased, opinion-based, limited facts way. It confirmed my beliefs of disagreeing with home births 100%. The goal should be to have women make an educated choice that's right for them, not a baised choice that's what Ricki Lake wants, as this documentary would have women do.",1313020800,3,761,4.8538461538461535

I work with expecting moms and I honestly was completely unaware of how child birth is seen and practiced in the American medical field. I really thought that hospitals provided expecting mothers complete education on the process of child birth. I was beyond shocked to learn that child birth is mainly driven by profit and convenience. The medical field had me fooled into thinking that natural child birth can be dangerous if not done in a hospital. Wow, knowledge is truly power and now I am definitely sharing this documentary with the expecting moms I work with, so they many have the knowledge, choice and power to make their OWN decisions about how they would like to bring their child into this world.

3117294,5,B0013LL2XY,"When I first heard of home birthing, the idea appealed to me.  Being on my own turf and delivering at my own pace seemed like the most natural way to give birth.  However, the idea scared me, too.  What if something went wrong?  If home birthing really safe?

What this documentary shows, in great detail, is that it's actually safer than a hospital birth. In hospitals, pregnancy is treated like an illness that the doctor ""saves"" a woman from. The reality, however, is that it's the doctor's interference that creates the illness.  There's a great cartoon illustrating how much overkill these procedures are.

Hospitals are a business designed to get patients in and out as quickly as possible.  This results in baby's being delivered on the hospital's schedule, not the baby's.  Midwives, in contrast, deliver on the baby's schedule.  For that, they're considered a threat to this business, resulting in smear campaigns (from the 1900s to now) designed to frighten women away from them, which you're shown.

This documentary offers an alternative to the standard way of giving birth, which Ricki Lake demonstrates in a filming of her second child's birth.  Her first birth was a hospital birth, which she felt robbed her of a meaningful experience because she felt pressured to perform.  With her second birth, she deviates from the ""normal"" position of women lying on their backs (which exacerbates their pain) and being drugged throughout.  The result was so beautiful, it moved me to tears.

I should note that this documentary doesn't discount a doctor's role in dangerous childbirths.  Instead, it shows that childbirth needn't be considered a scary illness.  Women's bodies are actually a lot smarter than given credit.  This message is important because it allows women to reclaim power over their bodies.",1310860800,2,1815,5.074324324324325

3117296,4,B0013LL2XY,"I thought my endless google searches had educated me almost as much as I was going to get on the subject!  But this DVD added to my knowledge!  I  left this documentary no longer wanting to enter the field of labor and delivery after graduating nursing school.  I've gained disappointment towards the field to an extent.  The part that affected me most, and hit close to home was the part on pitocin. I've always thought, ""I'd love to do home delivery, but what if something scary were to happen like before?!""  See, with each of my two daughters, there was a point when the nurses & respitory techs rushed in to give me oxygen, saying that the baby's heart rate was dropping.  Very scary for me.  Luckily the baby was OK & I delivered with out needing a c section or anything, but I wondered ""what if that happened again when delivering naturally?!  This DVD taught me how those scary encounters most likely wouldn't have happened if i delivered naturally.  I was taught by this DVD that pitocin is given to induce labor/contractions (which I knew).  Which caused unnatural and much stronger/longer/closer together contractions.  OK, fine.  But since they're all of the previously described, they're much more painful!  Often resulting in the desire for an epidural earlier.  So the woman gets her pain relief (epidural), yet it slows down labor's progress.  So the medical team provides more pitocin.  This of course brings on and intensifies more of those unnatural stronger/longer/closer together contractions.  So what does this do to the baby meanwhile?  Basically squeeze the **** out of it, causing a lower heart rate & less attainable oxygen. Sometimes it leads to, ""the baby's heartrate is dropping too much--we need to do an emergency c section!"".  Then after they say, ""Thank goodness we were able to perform that c-section so quickly to save your baby!"".  This is all of what happened to me (minus the c section fortunately), each time with my deliveries.  And I had no idea what was being done to me until I viewed this powerful DVD. You guys won't believe the other stuff you learn about labor & delivery, and it's history.  It's depressing.  A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  EMPOWER AND EDUCATE YOURSELF!!!!

3117299,5,B0013LL2XY,"This is an absolutely amazing film and honestly changed my life. I originally passively flipped this film on because it was about babies and I was just in the mood to watch something about babies! I had no idea what it was about and watched it on some random website that didn't even have a description of the movie on it. I am SO happy I did. I have always been one of those people who have been absolutely petrified of pain and fantasized about getting an epidural the moment the first contraction started- or, even better, marching up to the Labor & Delivery counter and refusing labor. ""GIMMIE A C-SECTION!"" I didn't want to feel anything. I was terrified. I was even so afraid of needles I had to be sedated in the past. Not anymore. This documentary changed ALL of that for me. It completely opened my eyes to a whole new way of doing things and I have gotten my hands on everything I can about natural childbirth ever since. I absolutely loved this film. It is wonderfully done, and I love that it recognizes that there is a time and a place for medical intervention, but that every birth does not require the level of intervention that has become standard in the United States and yet no where else in the world- and somehow we have the highest maternal and newborn death rate. There is something very wrong with that. I very much look forward to my birthing experience now whenever it will happen now, and also highly recommend the book ""Baby Catcher"" by Peggy Vincent. Also, look into HynoBabies as a childbirth preparation technique. It's an all inclusive class, course and can be done at home as well on an ipod and is highly effective. (Do note it is Hypno BABIES, not hypnobirth, which is different). Loved this film- changed my life! Really!",1307664000,2,1756,4.5251572327044025
3117300,2,B0013LL2XY,"I honestly I feel really offended but this documentary. They make people like me look stupid and uneducated because we chose to give birth in a hospital!.
I had my son in a hospital and I had an epidural and let me tell you... I wouldn't WANT to do it any other way.  I was relaxed, focused and it only took a few pushes and he was out. I am not saying that home birth is wrong, I mean, if you think is safe, by all means do it, but don't criticize the way I have my children.
When someone tells me that I am not capable to love my child the same as a woman who had a home birth because I was given a ""cocktail of drugs"" is simply ridiculous! How dare someone tell me that I am not a woman and that someone that had their baby without drugs is going to love their child more than me! He even compared women that have C-sections to a monkey and what would a monkey do in that situation!
I don't agree with schedule C-sections and I do agree that doctors can push either medications or procedures upon you just so they can charge more to the insurance companies, but I've seen this with pediatricians and my son's regular check-ups than when I had him.  Also, this is YOUR CHOICE, if you are Victoria Beckham and want to have 4 schedule C-sections... go right ahead, but don't do a documentary on how much better mother and human being you are because you did so.
I think this documentary while entertaining and with very heartfelt home moments and personal experiences lacks the ""other side"" factor. They are just pushing home birth as the best and SAFEST way to go, that hospital births are for those who want to be ""used"" by the system and that don't care about their children or their pregnancies, which certainly that's not the case with everyone and with every doctor.
I am mad, I was mad while watching this documentary and I am mad as I type this... I know I might be a few years late (this came out in 2007) but still! I am not less of a woman because I went to a hospital and had an epidural... so stop making it seem like I am!",1306800000,5,2036,4.16497461928934

3117356,4,B0013LL2XY,"I first watched this movie midway through my pregnancy, when I was ready to stop being scared, start getting educated, and explore what birth was really going to be like. My first impression was that it was extremely biased, with the goal of promoting home birth over hospital birth, and some of the comments from the natural birth advocates made me roll my eyes.

But I must say, even with my skepticism, the part about the cascade of interventions grabbed my attention and I couldn't shake it from my mind. The last thing I wanted was a C-section...I was already considering natural childbirth because I hate needles, so I was more afraid of an epidural than the pain of childbirth. Watching this movie really made me think and want to research the benefits versus risks of such common interventions. Up to that point, I only had one friend who had had a natural, unmedicated (hospital) birth, and didn't know anyone who had had a home birth. The majority of women I knew with kids spent more time shopping at Babies R Us than reading about birth or independently preparing for their births. Most of them read ""What to Expect When You're Expecting,"" maybe took a brief hospital childbirth class, went to the hospital as soon as their water broke, or got induced for whatever (non-medically indicated) reason, including ""I'm tired of being pregnant,"" got an epidural, and ""trusted their doctor"" and the hospital staff to take care of them. Did they have any idea what the risks were? Did they question anything? Were they treated badly and not even realize it, just accepted it as a part of the horror of childbirth that American culture perpetuates? Did they view birth as a medical event, an emergency waiting to happen, that needed to be actively managed?

Watching this movie brought out all of those questions in me, and made me seek out others who had experience with the more natural, non-medical side of birth, and I'm SO glad. My husband and I found an independent, natural-focused childbirth class, got a doula, and were well-prepared for our hospital birth. I continued my pregnancy with a completely different, positive outlook on birth, had no fear, and looked forward to it as what my body was made to do, a transformative experience! I was able to avoid almost all unwanted interventions...but the hospital still had their protocols, and I still had to submit to their control, which I didn't like. So while we weren't comfortable with home birth at that time, I will definitely be planning for one next time! It didn't register during my first viewing of the movie, but it did when I watched it again after my daughter was born--how calm and peaceful the home births were, how different the environment was,  the pain relief and relaxation provided by the water births, for example (good luck finding that at the hospital). When I compare the idea of that, with how I felt in the hospital, strapped to the fetal monitor, with 4 different nurses and an impatient doctor telling me how to push (on my back), I would definitely rather be at home in the tub.

I still admit the movie is biased, but I recommend it to all of my pregnant friends, just as a starting point, hoping that it will get them questioning things like it did for me, not so that they'll choose natural or home birth. I support all EDUCATED birth choices--it's when a woman is misled into something, by a care provider that she has blind trust in, and then disappointed with her birth outcome, where if she'd had all relevant information and been able to offer informed consent, things may have been different, that I have a problem with.",1302220800,17,3622,4.708201892744479

3117359,1,B0013LL2XY,"I'm a mother of two, and I found this movie to be extremely offensive if not downright dangerous. It uses lies, cheap scare tactics, and guilt trips to get its point across.

How to give birth is a deeply personal choice. What works for one woman may not work for another. Both my children were born in a hospital, and every decision I made regarding their coming into this world had months of research behind it. What I wanted above all was a healthy baby, and I got it, twice. I was not forced to lie on my back, or to take pitocin, or to have my perineum sliced, or anything of the sort... What I did, twice, was give birth in a safe, clean environment, with my loved ones and competent medical staff who stuck by me and cared about me and my babies. On the other hand, my mother, who had a normal pregnancy and a ""natural"" labor, ended up with severe postpartum hemorrhage that, had she been at home and not a hospital, would've killed her.

To insist your body was ""designed"" to give birth and blatantly disregard statistics and facts that show anything can happen and no one is guaranteed their labor will go smoothly, is arrogance and irresponsibility of the worst kind, because it involves juggling the life of another human being. To have some ""expert"" who's never given birth (and never will, due to being a man) sit there and philosophize about how a woman who's had a C-section or pitocin, QUOTE/UNQUOTE, ""doesn't care about the child because she doesn't receive that cocktail of love hormones released into the body during normal birth"", is beyond offensive (he even goes as far as to imply that hospital births are the reason our society is failing. Really? Boy, they sure had a great big utopia 300 years ago!) To suggest that a woman who chooses a hospital birth is ignorant, and to imply that she's less caring and loving toward her child is uncalled for. Yes, some may be uneducated, but in this day and age, most women diligently do their homework, and guess what... Many still choose to go to the hospital. Not everyone wants a hypothetical medal to go with their birth. Every woman who gives birth still goes through 9 months of pregnancy, feels her baby kick, hears the heartbeat, and cries tears of happiness when she first sees the little one on that ultrasound screen. Every woman who gives birth wants, above all, a healthy baby. Every woman wants to remember hearing her baby cry for the first time and holding her for the first time, not the dandy little fact that she gave birth in a bathtub because she is woman, hear her roar. There's something seriously wrong with people who think birthing your baby in a tub somehow makes you a better mom.

Who are you, Ricki Lake, to decide what is best for others? Who are you to tell women that having painkillers somehow makes it all less special, or makes them worse mothers? They demonize doctors, belittle women who choose hospitals, and state that homebirth is THE safest, best way to give birth, and yet in the end of the movie something goes wrong with the director's very own labor and she has to go to that evil hospital, where those evil doctors end up saving her baby's life... Seriously? What arrogance and total lack of integrity!

They never actually site statistics and facts. They don't tell you that today, a hospital setting doesn't equal being tied down and being medicated and cut against your will. They don't tell you that many hospitals today offer laboring women the opportunity to walk, be in any position they choose, be in the tub or shower, use doulas, and basically do whatever they want, unless there is an emergency. They glorify Europe's ""wonderful"" system but don't tell you that its high percentage of midwife births is due to COSTS, not CHOICE. They don't tell you that homebirth statistics are skewed because every time a homebirth requires an emergency procedure and the woman is sent to the hospital, it's not counted as homebirth but as a hospital birth. They don't give you statistics on what happens if something does go wrong with a homebirth. They don't mention that MANA (Midwives Alliance of North America) refuses to release its safety data to the public (I wonder why...). They don't tell you about all the babies and mothers who were hurt or died during homebirth.

Every responsible, caring woman wants what's best for her child. Shame on Ricky Lake & Co for making this biased, skewed, extremist rubbish. For the love of God, people, don't be swayed by it. Educate yourself before you jump on the bandwagon. Hurtbyhomebirth dot blogspot dot com is a good place to start.",1298246400,44,4591,4.635135135135135
3117360,5,B0013LL2XY,"My husband and I have been discussing since we got married the prospect of having biological children, as well as adopting. We have a 13 year old son from one of his previous relationships who was born via ""emergency"" C-Section. After over 12 hours of labor and 2 hours of pushing, the doctors determined that her hips were ""too narrow"" to push the baby through and rushed her to the OR for a C-Section that she did not want.

 After that experience my husband has been a fierce advocate for natural birth, and I was all FOR the hospital and the epidural.

 Then we watched our nephew being born in April of last year. My sister in law chose to have an induction and ended up with so much epidural in her system that 3 hours after her son's birth, she still needed assistance moving the lower half of her body because it was still numb.

 I started reading the book Your Best Birth by the makers of this film and the movie was mentioned. I tried to rent in here on Amazon but for some reason was unable to, but I found it on netflix and watched it last night.

 I must admit that as someone who is in her late 20's, and has yet to experience birth personally, I now know after watching this movie that I will be having a home birth with a midwife and probably a water birth at that. My husband has been joking for weeks (we will be starting to try for a child in about a year to 2 years) that our baby will not be born in a hospital after the experience he and his son's mother experienced in 1998. After seeing this movie - I believe that I will NOT be giving birth to my child in a hospital with medical intervention unless completely necessary!

 What a great film to watch. This is a movie that I think all expecting mothers, and expectant mothers-to-be should be watching!",1298246400,2,1777,4.246290801186944

This movie truly helps illustrate the problems with our maternity care in the United States and the outrageously negative attitudes that have been perpetrated about any alternative to the epidural-numbed hospital birth.

It was educational and discussed the importance of natural births. Yet, I thought that perhaps it was a bit too one-sided and may be exaggerating a bit.

The next week I went in to discuss my birth plan with my doctor and I experienced static and resistance when I mentioned the words ""birth plan"", ""natural"", and the possibility of a ""water-birth"". I then started realizing that this documentary was very true. I even went to the hospital's midwives department to discuss the possibility of transferring to their care and they got nervous as it's unusual for a patient to transfer from a doctor to a midwife halfway through pregnancy. Therefore, the documentary did adequately warn about the resistance a mother will encounter if she tries to go a different route rather than through the hospital.

The documentary is biased towards home births, suggesting that hospital births are unnecessary except in emergency cases. It also suggests that hospitals are profit driven, and often perform excessive procedures to increase their profits. Basically, this video does not describe birth, it describes the business side of birth. Good if you're undecided between hospital and home birth, but not good if you, like me, were looking for a scientific documentary instead.

I give it only two stars because I was very turned off by the graphic nature of the births filmed. The women are naked, and the camera is at the business end. I can't share this with my husband because he'll be traumatized!",1290902400,4,839,4.786206896551724

I come from a developing country, but I have friends from all over. I've been living in the US for a year, and I still can't believe how this technological, modern society, has transformed women's mentality. It's not my intention to offend anybody, but from my experience, the American woman (not all, of course) is the less intuitive person I've ever seen in my life. Things that have always been normal in most parts of the world (even in developed European countries)like giving vaginal births without medical intervention/pain medication, or breastfeeding, are all an issue here. Many women have degrees, or run business, but they still need to be educated at the most basic levels.

3117402,5,B0013LL2XY,"This documentary has been reviewed extensively so I will just throw in my 2 cents worth. It is no secret that our profit-driven medical field in the United States is becoming less and less healthy for all of us. Insurance companies and hospital boards have money on the forefront of their mind, not the well being of patients (although many individual medical professionals really are interested in patient well-being). This is a society that wants to throw drugs at everything, or cut people open for everything, or both. This film shows that birthing is no exception.

Human history goes back for thousands of years, and yet it has only been since the 1940's that the majority of births have happened in hospitals. On the outside, this sounds like progress but it has gotten to the point where women are being given the message that they don't know how to give birth. Many medical processes are wonderful in extreme cases where serious injury or death would result, but often times we are seeing insurance companies and profit-driven decisions to drug and cut. Take a look at this documentary, it is really eye-opening.",1286841600,2,1121,4.869109947643979

3117444,5,B0013LL2XY,"I just recently watched ""The Business of Being Born"" for the first time, and found that it was a well-made, informative and timely film.  The information portrayed in the movie definitely goes against mainstream obstetrical practice, but I personally feel (as do many others) that it is important to rethink the medical stance taken on birth, and not be afraid to go against the mainstream ""tradition"".  I am pregnant right now, and I have already researched natural birth extensively, as well as am related to or am friends with several women who have had one or multiple joyous, healthy homebirths.  So this film did nothing to change my opinion on natural birth, only solidify it.

Even though I gave this five stars for a job well done, I still think a little bit more could have been said about ""in between"" options.  Like a natural, midwife-attended hospital birth or birth centers.  There was a little too much drama focused on the stars as well, which could have possibly been focused more on facts about homebirths, etc... at the same time, this wasn't an ordinary documentary and the dramas of personal birth do add a lot to the film.  In some cases, they brought me to tears.  The film really captured the joy of a healthy and fulfilling birth experience, and of the power of a woman's body to bear and birth her baby.

One reviewer mentioned that the ending was anticlimactic, with the star (*SPOILER*) having a c-section simply because the baby was breech. I disagree.  Having a doctor-attended c-section was necessary for her, because her baby was many weeks premature and suffering from IUGR, a very dangerous condition.  A basic full-term breech birth which was otherwise uncomplicated could possibly have been attended to at home, but not one so premature.  So there is a time and place for doctors, as well, which is proven on the film.  They simply may not be as necessary to a normal, healthy, uncomplicated pregnancy and birth.  In fact, they may be detrimental, as the film shows.

The only other comments I have are that a few of the natural birth scenes were a bit graphic for younger viewers, and there was some foul language used in the film, which I think would have been better to have been ""bleeped"" out.  Other than that, I highly recommend this film to any women who is pregnant or planning on having children in the future.  It is truly a mind-altering experience!",1285027200,3,2396,4.734939759036145
3117445,4,B0013LL2XY,"The film does a good job explaining how birth has become a medicalized event, and our culture is so brainwashed into thinking it is some sort of emergency that doctors have to save us from. It doesn't even occur to most people that you could have a homebirth. It explains how interventions can lead to more complications and a higher c-section rate, and the fact that doctors are pushing for c-sections now for convenience and monetary reasons, or to rush the birth. In short, the medical industry has stolen birth from women.

I think a lot of women don't realize that hospital birth has changed drastically in the past few decades. From speaking to my mother and other women around that age, giving birth 20 years ago, women didn't really even think about epidurals and just had their babies. Nowadays, most women expect to get an epidural, and hospitals now routinely give women pitocin when there is no medical reason to do so. Just knowing that in a hospital setting they really don't follow a woman's natural birthing mechanism but instead try to control it themselves is enough to turn me off to the idea of giving birth in a hospital. I have not had any children but when the time comes I will look at my options carefully.

Midwives are presented as a better option for women having normal births, since women in most other countries use midwives and have better outcomes. OB/GYN's are presented as what they truly are- a doctor that is trained to help women that are having complications and perform surgery in an emergency.

The only thing I was disappointed about in the film was the ending. Abby planned on having a homebirth, but went into labor prematurely, and the baby was breech. I understand the need for her to have the baby in the hospital because of this, but what I don't understand is why they immediately do a c-section. The baby being premature and the baby being breech are both not necessarily reasons to have a c-section. The film is almost protraying that which they were just speaking out against- the fact that doctors push c-sections nowadays for almost anything. The whole thing seemed kind of fishy, like they wanted the c-section to happen in the end so they could say ""See, we believe c-sections are good when necessary!"" because they needed something to show everyone that hospitals are ok in some cases.",1283472000,2,2342,4.7073170731707314

Also shows C-section experiences and really puts what we have learned from TV shows and Popular rumors that are used to telling us how we should have our babies. It gives women in general a good resource that will show us how to make birthing an empowering experience instead of one where we are told what to do or how to do it.

3117475,5,B0013LL2XY,"First, I'll admit I do agree with some of the criticism of the movie. I knew little about Ricky Lake before this film (except a vague awareness of her daytime TV show), and I agree there were MANY side issues & follow-up questions they could have tackled.

Having said that, for a 90 minute documentary on the subject, they crammed a LOT of information here.... AND it was fun, funny, scary, sad, etc. It was a bit of a history lesson, a bit of modern medicine, and it was entertaining. And, it was certainly NOT a dry documentary.

What else can you ask for in a movie? Even though there were other issues I wish it had raised, the film did an excellent job of asking questions, then encouraging parents to go seek out their OWN information, and work out a plan that works for YOU.

So I give it 5 full stars. This raises questions that every parent should be asking (are hospitals driven by profit vs concern for your child's health? do the epidural & other drugs do more harm than good? are vaginal births better for you & your child than C-Section?) ... the central question, of course, is simply: What is best for my child?

I'm continually shocked at how few people ask that question, which is (in my opinion) your primary role as parent - what is best for your child? Identify what the best practices are, and do your best to follow them. Your goal isn't ""perfection"" - but it's also NOT defending past decisions, or family history. So many people just mimic the parenting methods their parents used, not even realizing that, hey! - there may be some new research and better methods out there.

This usually means going against the mainstream, or seriously questioning your doctor. And I'm continually shocked at how few people are willing to do this. It may mean being persistent at the hospital in turning down drugs, drips, and pain killers (did you know that the placenta does NOT filter the drugs - your child gets 100% of the dose!). It this might mean looking into the overwhelming new research that says most of those traditional childhood vaccines do more harm than good.

And asking the tough questions might mean (as it did for us) that your past decisions were made on bad information ... and now it's time for BETTER decisions for your children based on NEW / BETTER information. Please don't let your ego get in the way of making better decisions for your baby. (Remember the Milgram Experiment - people were willing to hurt others & themselves just because a guy in a white lab coat told them to!)

3117476,1,B0013LL2XY,"I purchased and watched this movie after reading the book written by the creators of the film (Your Best Birth). The book was much fairer by far. This movie was very one-sided and used scare tactics such as ""OBs are trained as surgeons"" and ""Birthing with interventions affects mother/baby attachment."" The ""experts"" often cite statistics that are from other countries such as The Netherlands but without really explaining the differences in the medical system.

The director of the movie ends up with a C-Section because her son comes early, and even then they don't say anything positive about the medical establishment. Her baby may have died otherwise. If birthing in a hospital, there are a lot of ways to overcome the establishment but it takes research on each individuals part--there is no one answer. It would have been nice to see more of that in the film.

The film bordered on propaganda with so many ""experts"" who had a larger interest in limiting what choices women could make for the sake of home birth, instead of opening up the range of ways women can take control in a range of experiences. There were parts of a comedy film interspersed which takes away from the seriousness of the film. The last woman who gives birth at home does it in front of cardboard boxes with a flashlight. This may not appeal to all women, but natural or unmedicated births may. It would be nice to see a follow-up film with women who don't support just one agenda.

I got some great research for my paper, but I also learned a great deal about the business of birthing in this country. When I have kids, I plan on having all-natural waterbirths. Before I watched this documentary, I'd never even heard of a waterbirth and I assumed *everyone* got doped up on painkillers and spinal tabs and had screaming, sweaty births. It really is sad how dependent our country has become on artificial drugs. Obviously there are many, many good things that come out of certain medicines and painkillers, but birth is *supposed* to hurt, you are squeezing a watermelon out of a quarter! Birth is a natural process that all mammals do, and have been doing since we evolved millions of years ago.

Mostly it was the commentary by one of the people interviewed--she seemed ignorant and was stating a few things that simply weren't true (but were her opinion).  The other thing I found unacceptable was at the very end when the director went into pre-term labor and didn't even call her doctor.  I know she was at the cusp of when doctors would try stopping early labor (36/37 weeks), but even that early, babies can have problems breathing on their own or other issues.

I experienced the very standard ""fetal monitor"" BS - whereby the technicians hook you up to determine if the baby can ""withstand"" the stress of birth and, of course, the fetal monitoring itself caused my baby's heart rate to speed up and the decision was made that I required an ""emergency"" c-section.  All very textbook, according to today's medical procedures.

For my second child, I elected to go with a home birth, but, alas, legally the State of Pennsylvania does not ""allow"" a home birth following a Cesarean, even an unnecessary one.  I was lucky - and pushy enough - to get a midwife in the hospital delivery room.  Still I dealt with a doctor who clearly condescended to my wishes for a v-back, and, after stitching me up following my episiotomy sneered sarcastically ""well you got what you wanted, didn't you?""

3117541,5,B0013LL2XY,"I had been told my entire life (and of course, this is all you will ever see in the movies, too) that women have their babies in the hospital. This is how its done, right?

Wrong.

In every other country (except America) the MAJORITY of women use midwives and deliver their babies at home. America uses hospital births as the standard (over 85% of all births), yet we have the second highest infant mortality and mother mortality rates of any country in the WORLD! Maybe hospitals aren't the best option after all.

Ricki Lake has created a wonderful documentary about the ""business of being born."" She shows, using numerous interviews and proven facts, that hospital births are just that: a business. She talks about the history of midwives and shows women going through delivery with a midwife versus the women going through delivery at the hospital. She interviews nurses and doctors from the labor and delivery units of several hospitals asking them if they have ever seen anyone deliver a baby naturally (vaginally, no drugs or inducements). None of them had. Ricki Lake shows how the increased use of pitosin and other inducement drugs correlate with the rise in birth defects and child behavioral problems like Autism.

It is an incredibly eye-opening movie that all expecting couples should see before deciding the route of delivery that they want to take. Also great for people who have not yet started having children (it's never too early to think about it). It is definitely worth the small investment of money for the video to hear the whole truth (especially when you think about the fact that a midwife costs about $4000 for all pre and post-natal care and delivery, while just giving birth in a hospital can cost over $10,000). This video will help you make an informed decision.

I've always felt they stopped about halfway or 3/4s of the way through the process of getting hard facts and data into the documentary.  There's a lot of great information, but from the title, I was expecting more of an expos on the specifics of the ""birth industry"" in America than this is.  I like the way the documentary ended, so it didn't wander into ""All medical interventions are bad and just a grab for your money!"" territory, I thought it really balanced out the whole thing.

The personal stories are wonderful (though I wish we had spent more time with the midwifery practice to personalize that story more), the information is fascinating, the births are amazing, and it's all packaged beautifully.  Again, the only complaint is that I would have liked -more- specifics on insurance company profiteering, policy trends that care more about protecting against liability than making sure the woman is really cared for, and things of that nature (the Business end of ""The Business of being born"").  Usually I would object to some of the language that is occasionally involved that is not edited out and could have been, but I've been at births, I know how it can be when you're right in the hea(r)t of it and I think it's not wrong to show it.

3117571,5,B0013LL2XY,"Thank you Ricki Lake for using your power as a celebrity to produce a film which has changed the way we look at birth. Even more powerful then Ms Lakes celebrity status is her power as a consumers to change birth in America. Hospital administrators don't sit at board meetings asking the question ""how will our policies empower women in birth"". Theirs is simply the bottom line of gross earnings. If women do not stand up for the kind of care they want, it simply won't be there. This film educates and arms women with the truth about the routine care they are receiving. It awakens the American public to the myths of the ""safe hospital birth verses the dangerous homebirth"". This information has been out there for years, but this film attempts to bring it to mainstream. As a Certified Nurse Midwife who has practiced homebirth for over 30 years, this was the most exciting film created about birth, period. Now it is in our hands, the consumers.
In the 1970s women demanded that their husbands be present during childbirth and for a natural birth experience. They wrote letters to the hospitals, to the papers, to legislators, and to anyone willing or not willing to listen. They drove hours to go to hospitals that honored their demands showing local hospitals they would loose money if they didn't provide different care. Men handcuffed themselves to their wives and couples flew, in labor, to have a natural birth, showing administrators how far they would go to get what they wanted. By the early 1980s birth improved in many cities in America. There were more options, and depending upon the area you lived, hospitals were moving more towards a ""home like"" experience for families and the rise in out of hospital Birth Centers was significant and even the demand for homebirth crept up. What happened? Women stopped complaining and the epidural became fad. Technology became safety and fear replaced empowerment. Women quickly forgot they could give birth and the c-section rates skyrocketed. Hospitals soon found out that if they let families in, hung wallpaper, and placed a rocking chair in the room, they could cut corners and slowly but surly remove all of the power women had fought for. What we as women did not give away, malpractice and litigation placed the fatal blow to. This film shows the outcome of what was lost, what the truth is, and opens your eyes to what is possible.
We are in turbulent times in America and healthcare is in the forefront of these issues. I have seen the power of standing up for the right to give birth with real safety, dignity and empowerment. And I have seen how complacency has taken it all away. Watch this film, show it to everyone you can. Then go out there and form local consumer groups to take back your birth. Your baby doesn't get a ""do over"" and you deserve to have a safe birth and the kind of birth you desire. Thanks again Ricki Lake for planting this seed! Note: Not all women want or can have a homebirth, but midwifery care works with high risk as well as low risk births just as well. I did my internship at Santa Fe Indian Hospital in Santa Fe, NM. This was a midwifery run service with a collaborative practice of an OB/GYN and Midwives. We co-managed all high risk births, and if it was a vaginal delivery, the midwife did the delivery. This population had a very high rate of diabetes and pre-eclampsia, as well as social economic risk factors. With a Midwifery Model of Care and exceptional cooperation between our collaborative OB doctors, we had a 12% C-section rate. Something the World Health Organization state should be the percentage of C-section in the general population. High risk woman do not have to feel that midwifery care can not benefit them. Think of the possibilities if you had access to collaborative care ware your providers believed in your ability to give birth. All women should demand the right to have this type of care in all settings.",1252540800,2,3936,4.69753979739508

3117575,3,B0013LL2XY,"Like all documentaries, this one is biased.  Overall, it explained a few things I was wondering about.  First of all, what are my options on alternative births?  What is the downfall of modern science?  What is best for me and my baby is something I need to decide myself, but this movie gave me information to help me make that decision.  I did not go into this movie thinking it would be unbiased.  What documentary is?  I did not like how the only doctors interviewed believed the system was faulty with the exception of one who they constantly proved wrong.  Ever doctor was also from NYC.  I am from a smaller Midwestern community and I think that the doctors in this area may have different opinions.  Maybe they would not have a birth plan system or maybe they would be more accommodating.  I only really know my doctor.  Which is another thing that was not explored at all.  My doctor is a family practice doctor.  He has provided care for me since I was 12.  Every doctor in the movie was only in the picture for prenatal care and delivery.
Also, I laughed at propaganda of the portrayal of the original hospital births.  Yeah they were bad!  But so was hospital care at that point!  They had barely moved away from blood letting!  What the medical profession was 100 years ago is a far cry from today.
I also have no option for alternative births.  The closest midwife (and then only one) is 80 miles away.  The next closest (Minneapolis) is a 5 hour drive.  This type of situation was never discussed.  I would have like to hear more about alternative birthing plans in the hospital.  There was only one view of the hospital birthing.  My thought is that the filmakers needed to do more research and spend more time on the movie.

What I liked:

I did find it very informative into many aspects of home birthing and midwifery.  I did not realize all the medications that were given during labor and all the interventions. I am happy I am now more aware they are not all necessary other than speeding it up for the doctor. This has made me more prepared for these decisions and has given me more time to do more research.  Most women I know would not give hospital birthing a second thought.  I guess part of that reason is there are few options, but I have never heard a single discussion about alternative births in any discussion on birth I have had with another female.

I am not necessarily saying I did not like the movie, only that it was biased.  I was appreciative of the information I did receive, although I wish it were more complete.  I think this movie brought alternative births out in the open and hopefully it will be something looked at more critically with future mothers.",1249344000,60,2701,4.480492813141684

3117590,2,B0013LL2XY,"I am definitely a fan of natural childbirth, midwifery, home births, etc. but this movie makes women like me (once again) feel inadequate.  I am unable to have such a birth (other than natural--unless, God-forbid, intervention is required) because I am a high-risk patient due to autoimmune disease.  My baby will need to be checked out immediately after birth of signs of neonatal lupus, heart block, or any other medical issue.  I will need to be tended to because my risk of bleeding out is very high.  I have been on blood thinners my entire pregnancy and will be on them for 6 weeks after our baby is born.  Given that, I won't be able to breastfeed.  Breast is best, but for women in my position we are unable to provide that because our child cannot have that medication in their system.  This makes me feel almost criminal, as well as this overwhelming push to not have a baby in a hospital.  Frankly, I'd rather be ALIVE and on medication than not be around to care for my child her entire life.

I do appreciate this documentary, and wish I could be on that side.  I just wish they offered more assurance to women in my position to make us feel more comfortable with not being able do as they do.

3117607,5,B0013LL2XY,"Before I bought this, I saw what some people wrote about nudity and profanity and was a little bit skeptical. Those people are so WRONG!!! This film is amazing!! It is an updated film about the benefits of home birth. This film is a documentary not a movie. It has not been edited to cut out the parts that may not sit well with everyone. It shows real women (including Riki) in their unique birthing processes. They do not claim to be comparing home vs hospital birth. It is simply a film that shows women that there is another birthing option out there. If you know that a hospital birth is not for you but you are unsure of what lies ahead, get this film. It is honest. Even when some births end up going to the hospital they didn't edit it out. It shows women at home and in birthing centers giving birth. They don't shy away from certain parts of the process as many films have done in the past. This film bares all. The nudity is shown within the context of birthing and the profanity as others have noted is by the mothers themselves in the heat of labor. Not just some foul mouthed women spewing swears just because. Even though the nudity is minimal, if you are uncomfortable in your skin as a woman and nudity bothers you then refrain from this film.

It is a film that I will be recommending for years to come, to open the eyes of women who are afraid of birth. This film sheds light on the fear-mongering that the AMA and the obstetrics industry have done since the 1900's. It questions why everywhere in the developed world except the US is home birth and midwifery the norm and not the exception? It questions why insurance companies will sometimes make it difficult or sometimes even refuse, to cover non-hospital or doctor based care for mothers to be even though it is thousands of dollars cheaper.

It is a film that at the very least will make you check up on your chosen hospital and see how many C-sections they do, how many interventions and episiotomies they perform. At the most it will set you on the path to making home birth a viable option for your future births.",1242518400,,2091,4.38659793814433
3117608,4,B0013LL2XY,"This personal and compelling documentary explores current attitudes toward home-birth in the United States. Following a home-birth mid-wife as she makes the rounds from prenatal to postnatal checkups as well as a few live births in the homes of women in New York City, ""The Business of Being Born"" asks the viewer ""what kind of birth do you want, and why?""
Helpful and informative interviews with myriad birth authorities (from Farm midwife Ina May Gaskin to OBGYN Dr. Jacques Moritz) are sprinkled throughout this film, offering both pro home-birth narrative as well as explaining modern medicine's reluctance to accept and facilitate natural drug-free, intervention-free, home-birth for low risk mothers.
Particularly interesting is the presentation of historical reasons in the United States for moving birth from the home to the hospital.
This documentary is both touching and engaging. It puts a human face on the birth experience.
While it exposes the medical community as generally uninformed about home-birth, it is not a condemnation of hospital birth.
I recommend this movie for anyone who is pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant. I also recommend this film for those employed in obstetrics. If watched with an open mind, it has the potential to improve the way that many hospital employees treat laboring women.
I believe that the most useful message this movie offers is that women should feel empowered to be active participants on birth rather than passive, unknowing and generally untrustworthy vessels.",1242000000,,1523,5.35
3117609,5,B0013LL2XY,"This film articulated so well the feelings that I had about my birth experience.  My son was born in a hospital 9 years ago.  I did not head to the hospital completely nave about things.  I had read some books and taken a class but I had never really discussed a birth plan with my OB.  I was young and very introverted at the time and I did not feel comfortable speaking up for myself.  I went to the hospital after a routine weekly check reveled that I was ""borderline"" for preeclampsia. Since this is a very serious condition, SOME of the intervention I received was probably necessary, but some definitely was not.  They gave me pain medication in my IV without asking if I wanted it. They instructed me to push before I felt I was ready and I ended up pushing for over an hour.  They removed the bottom of the bed and had me put my feet on plates that were way too far away from me and way too far apart to be comfortable and when I asked if they could just put the bed back the way it was they refused.  God forbid my comfort as a laboring woman inconvenience them.  In 11 hours of labor I was stuck to a bed the whole time. I was told what to do, what I was not allowed to do, and what they were going to do whether I liked it or not.

I am planning my next pregnancy in the next year or so and I have already started searching for Certified Nurse Midwives in my area to facilitate a home birth.  I do realize that preeclampsia is a very serious and dangerous condition for both mother and child.  If there is any indication that I may need to go to the hospital I would be totally open to that.  However, this time around no one is doing anything unless they explain to me why they feel the need to do it and I agree.

Thank you to Ricki Lake and Abby Epstein for re-affirming my belief that the hospital birth experience was designed for the doctors, staff, hospital and insurance companies and has very little to do with the mother and child.  My husband thought that the whole home birth thing was for crazy granola and tofu yoga hippies, but after watching this film with me (to my surprise) he agreed that a home birth should be our plan A.",1241827200,,2153,4.15421686746988
3117610,5,B0013LL2XY,"""The Business of Being Born"" is a fascinating and eye-opening documentary about the current state of our maternity health system and the alternative of home births.

Ricki Lake and Abby Epstein produced a compelling movie, that helps educate women on their options. It explains, why a lot of times giving birth in a hospital, with all its routine interventions, is ""over-kill"". The movie reminded us that giving birth is something that women know how to do intuitively. But somehow the medical community took over and now views pregnancy as if it were a disease that needs to be treated.

Yet, the statistics show that way of thinking isn't necessarily safer. The United States, with its high rates of scheduled C-sections and hospital births, also have very high numbers of infant deaths compared to countries with higher rates of natural births.

The bottom line is, if you are having an uncomplicated pregnancy, then giving birth at home with a trained professional (aka midwife) might be a very rewarding experience for you and your baby. Definitely something you should look into.",1238112000,,1085,5.050279329608938
3117611,5,B0013LL2XY,"The film intends to bring some transparency to state of birthing in the US. It doesn't conclude with ""doctors and hospitals are evil"" yet it also shows that homebirth is not just for hippies living in barns!

The film prompts its viewers to ask tough questions:

Why does the United States have the highest rate of maternal and neonatal deaths surrounding labor and delivery among all domesticated countries? With advances in medical techology and knowledge, why hasn't this mortality rate decreased in over 20 years?

What are other countries doing differently that is producing less injury and fewer losses of life?

Why do people spend more time researching what type of digital camera to purchase than they do researching the safest way to deliver their child?

Why has birth become such an event that women often anticipate with so much dread, instead of a natural part of life?

Why do intelligent, educated women spend 9 months of their pregnancy avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and even tylenol; but the moment labor approaches, they beg for maximum pain relief and expect this has NO effect on their baby?

Why is the cesarean rate increasing so quickly in our country, and should we be concerned about that?

Why are the majority of baby's birth certificates showing deliveries on weekdays during regular business hours?

What does an ideal birth look like? A ""healthy"" baby and a ""healthy"" mom? Or is there more?

As a culture, are we moving toward better birthing or away from it?

The film is an introduction to many aspects of the home birth and hospital birth discussion, and does a good job of keeping things balanced. I've talked to moms and dads, midwives, and OBs who have seen it, and overall it is a thought-provoking result.

For me, I'm a planner/researcher personality, so this film would not be enough to convince me either to have or not have a home birth. I've read at least 15 books on the subject now, and that is what has convinced me. However, my husband will never read those books, so this film was a good way to get him involved in the dicussion and decisions that we will make for our future children.

My top booklist if you're thinking about home birth: ""Pushed"" Jennifer Block 2007, and ""Born in the USA"" Dr. Marsden Wagner 2006, for current intellectual research and statistics involving birth. ""Ina May's Guide to Childbirth"" Ina May Gaskin 2003 and ""Birthing from Within"" Pam England 1998, for emotionally encouraging stories and feel-good about anticipating your birth type of ideas.

Hopefully, this film will be to birthing what Supersize Me was to fast food. Yes, we still have McDonalds around, and plenty of people eat there. But maybe more people will eat at home, or make more healthy choices. And McDonalds and other chains are removing transfats and selling salads. Generally speaking, the US population is a bit more aware of the dangers of overindulging in fast food, including the loss of life from obesity and obesity-related diseases.

This film would hopefully have a similar result: Yes, we still have doctors and hospitals around, and plenty of women are delivering in them every day. But a greater percentage of births would happen at home with licensed professionals. Hospitals would stop giving pitocin, epidurals, and other interventions to practically every woman in labor, and they would work to decrease their cesarean rates. Generally speaking, the US population would be more aware of options for birth, and would investigate the subject more before blithely succombing to a birth experience that is resulting in loss of life and permanent damage to women and babies across our country. I'm sorry, did I get on my soapbox just now?

Enjoy the film, and make the best decision you can as parents, for the sake of your unborn children.",1237161600,2,3797,4.90015600624025

3117615,2,B0013LL2XY,"Informative? Sure. Gives a new perspective on a broken system? Definitely. Entertaining? Er ...not really.

After talk-show host Ricki Lake experienced a bad childbirth in-hospital, she decided to try a midwife, and thus THE BUSINESS OF BEING BORN was ...um ...birthed. I can't help but think that some of this (not all) was a ploy by Lake to put herself back in the public eye; specifically, the movie industry. Although this is strictly a documentary, and other actors support various causes (from freeing Darfur to Tibetan independence), this one felt a bit more forced.

The reason I say this is that the entire documentary was exceptionally boring and exceptionally lopsided. I work in the medical field (as an RN) but not in an Obstetrics setting. I can, however, vouch for the terrible cost of healthcare and some of the impersonalness of those giving it (as this documentary pointed out). I've heard doctors talking about ""tee times"" on the golf course and the need to ""get home by dinner,"" so time is a big factor for physicians (the film pointed out that C-section deliveries peek at 4pm -- just prior to dinnertime -- and again at 10pm -- so doctors can get home to bed). Be damned whether the patient needs a C-section or not, doctors force the decision so that they can ""get on with their lives."" Cut and run!

Even with its interesting take on the care of OB/Gyn patients in the U.S., the film never delves outside of the States even though certain statistics are presented (including telling us that the infant mortality rate in the U.S. is one of the highest amongst developed countries). I would've liked to have seen at least one interview with a Japanese midwife or a European midwife, and have them show us how their system works. But we're never give the opportunity to see this for ourselves.

The boring nature of the film is that it never really finds its focus. Although the title of it is The Business of Being Born, it focused more on the plight of midwives and their care of expectant mothers at home or in midwife clinics. We drive around with midwives, trot down the road with midwives, listen to midwives talk on the phone to patients, and get to watch a couple of in-home births. Then we start the entire process over again.

And there's also a brief and confusing stint in which we learn one of the film's producers is pregnant and trying to decide on prenatal care.

All-in-all it's an informative story, but one that might cause a few too many yawns.",1233360000,8,2485,4.662100456621005

3117627,5,B0013LL2XY,"I was so happy to finally see a documentary come out in support of homebirth and midwifery.  I reject the complaint that the movie is one-sided as a reason to discredit it... the ACOG and AMA statements against homebirth are also one-sided, yet are taken very seriously by many.  I am a veterinarian, and understand very well the medical implications of using and not using certain interventions.  I do not thing that OB's are intentionally judgemental, it is what they have been taught in their medical training.  Until true natural childbirth is taught to OB's, they can never understand what women like me want, or how to give it.  I resent that they are trying to take away my right to birth my babies the way nature intended.  I would never tell another woman that she could NOT go to the hospital if that was what made her most comfortable.  For my first deilvery, we went to the hospital with a doula and a birth plan that had been discussed in prior appointments.  Nothing that was discussed was allowed to happen.  I was not allowed to get out of bed to urinate once I was past 9 centimeters for fear the baby would ""fall out"", he was taken from me immediately and placed in a warmer, pitocin was continuosly pushed on me even though neither I nor the baby were in distress, and I was made to push lying flat on my back even though he was stuck and needed to turn.

I am grateful for this movie, because it can open the eyes of many women and reassure them that they ARE able to birth their babies, and that a trained midwife is able to safeguard mother and baby at home, transferring to a hospital if medical assistance is needed.  This is the European model, and it works well there.  Our nation is near the bottom in perinatal statistics, surely we can all agree that the current system is not working.  Thank you to Ricki Lake for opening a dialogue, and shame on AGOG and AMA for being threatened by nature and immediately shutting down any dialogue with threats of legislation.

This film takes you through the astounding history of childbirth in the United States, all the way to today - when one of every three births occurs by c-section, and childbirth is indeed a business rather than an intimate, natural event.  This is an eye-opening and thoughtful movie, one that shows women that there are other options available rather than succumbing to the ""standard"" childbirth today, which is sorely lacking.",1228521600,,652,5.382352941176471

Ricki Lake is a wonderful ""maverick"" behind this movie, but it is not about her. It is a very informative documentary on the history and state of maternity care in this country, which has completely lost sight of the normal, natural physiological process of childbirth.

Did you know that the World Health Organization recommends a cesarean rate of 10-15%, and that infant mortality increases when that rate is exceeded? Did you know that the rate of cesarean births in this country is over 30% and rising? But ask your OB and hospital what their rates are, because they may well be 40% or higher, depending on where you live!

Women and babies in this country are being done a tremendous disservice by the medical community. They are being robbed of an amazing, natural phenomenon for the sake of convenience and malpractice insurance. Please, do yourself and your baby a favor and educate yourself on your options for pregnancy and birth. For women in low-risk categories, birth outside of the hospital has been proven to be as safe or safer than birth in a hospital.

Even a couple of maternal nurse instructors told me that they would use a midwife if the hospital equipment was near by. I have to say that I'm disappointed that my nursing school did not cover midwife delivery in lecture. How can future nurses advise patients (aka CLIENTS in our nursing books) of all the options available to them when we don't discuss alternative delivery options ourselves?  Women are now having c-sections so that their child can enroll in school more quickly.  The world is in such a rush we're rushing babies out of their womb before they're ready. The happiest baby on the block is another good dvd to watch.  I think the reason for the state mandated PKU test of neonates or newborns should be looked at because I think it has to do with the effects of splenda. Don't believe me? Just google PKU and splenda and then google PKU and newborn and test.  I tried to bring this observation up with my instructor but it went in one ear and out the other and I was told that I don't critically think.,1226620800,,1145,4.485576923076923
3117632,5,B0013LL2XY,"just watched this documentary and was very moved by it...to tears and anger.  i have had 5 home births and plan my 6th in a couple of weeks.  i have witnessed a birth in the hospital and it was exactly how it was portrayed in the film.  we went in completely wanting a natural birth and gradually the machines and complete strangers took over the birth.  eventually, the mother was told a c-section would be done if she didn't get on with it which gave her incentive to do all she could (even though she couldn't feel anything 'cos of all the meds they gave her).  i left the experience shaking with anger and wracked with sobs that they had deprived my friend of the wonderful experience birth is supposed to be.  i'm a wimp when it comes to everything but i will not be denied my right to give birth how i want to the way GOD created me to.  i hate that women have this taken away from them and that babies are put through torture with all the meds and interventions.  and that the doctors dare to tell all the women they mess with that it was for their own good, and how the doctors 'saved' their lives and that of their newborns...absolute lies in most cases.
please, consider home birth.  look into it in depth don't just 'go with the flow.'  before doctors took over women gave birth with their friends and family around them at home for centuries.  yes it hurts, but the rewards are forever.  i've never met anyone who regretted their homebirth and yet have countless friends have terrible hospital experiences.
a friend of mine who is a doctor said that there is no such thing as a 'natural' birth in a hospital...as soon as you walk in it is 'unnatural' and i totally agree.
blessings on those of you who have chosen and will choose homebirth...may that wonderful practice never be squashed by anyone!!

3117634,2,B0013LL2XY,"My wife and I have briefly talked about midwives vrs OBGYN's. My wife was delivered by a midwife at home. We are open to the idea of delivering at home and learning about the different options as well as the risks.

We are awaiting our 2nd child.

What I saw that I liked:

I enjoyed the openmindedness of the movie presenting a positive viewpoint of home births. Pointing out that women having a different perspective than a lot of OBGYN's.

Being raised by an OBGYN I have had difficulties understanding the ""hospital is best"" perspective. I learned that an OBGYN was taught specific procedures, and tests that should be given to produce specific results. Med students are great at knowing different parts of the body, diagnosing illnesses, and working with urgent situations. They aren't trained adequately in the different ways the bodies healing systems work together. They don't view child birth as a natural process, but rather as a condition that needs to be treated. Due to this it can be hard for OBGYN's to believe in and understand alternative child birthing methods.

I agree that hospitals birthing is limiting. Because of this some OB's can not be as personal as they could be. They are given standards that they follow irregardless of what the women may want.

You can't blame OBGYN's. You can't blame hospitals. The whole system is full of quirks. But we can't live without them.

Things I didn't like,

The movie talked about OBGYN's only being trained in doing surgeries all day long. It stated that they don't have the proper training to do OB Care with the patients. They don't always provide the emotional care that the mother needs during the birthing process. Midwifes can fulfill this need more easily. The movie did not list any benefits about hospital births and is therefore very biased.

I didn't appreciate seeing a lady compeletly nude in the bathtub. I understand that it is part of the birthing process but they didn't need to show it in that way in the movie.

It stated that OBGYN's don't offer as personalized care as mid wive's can. I think that depends on the individual mid wife and OB. In the movie the lady talked about having a midwife and and OB and her never thinking about going back to the OB. What I got out of this is that she had an impersonal OB and a personal midwife.",1222473600,19,2319,4.661764705882353

My wife wanted me to watch this with her as we are having our second child in April 2009.  When our daughter was born in June 2006, we had the negative experience many women expressed in the film about the hospital experience.  We planned for a natural birth and ended up having multiple interventions including a c-section which was not what we wanted at all, and may not have been necessary at all with a home birth situation.

I have been trying to get pregnant for months now, and in that time I have been researching different methods of birth. I was in the hospital room when my older sister had my niece and I saw what a beautiful miracle it all was, but I was chagrined about the hospital staff and their methods. My sister was almost fully dilated when we got there, her labor going smoothly no drugs at all, and as soon as she was in the door they wanted to start her on Pitocen, I felt their need to get it all over and done with and my sister also felt that pressure and gave in, my niece was born within the hour.

The Business of Being Born touches on that subject, of women being given drugs to hurry up the process because the staff wants the mother to give birth, so they can either move on to the next or go home. I understand that, it IS a business after all, hospitals have to make money also and a natural childbirth isn't going to bring in the cash, or free up a bed. The Documentary also touches on how the surgical community, hospitals, doctors took childbirth out of the midwives hands and put pregnant women flat on their backs, drugged up and put through things they shouldn't have to be put through. Its illogical how women are treated, it's sad how its now out of their hands, and its scary that most people aren't informed of the choices they have.

Natural childbirth to your average American woman is pictured as painful and just for the Granola Hippie types. They don't see it as taking back their bodies, and minds, and truthfully allowing birth to be what nature intended. Do women actually think that they will die of pain if they don't have the drugs? Do women forget that our bodies are amazing? We have hormones, and chemicals and our physiology is crafted especially for giving birth! We aren't meant to be lying on our backs, with needles in our arms and some doctor telling us that ""its time"" and than pumping us with drugs that we know NOTHING about their long term effects, and causing our babies undue stress in the womb. Babies will come out when they are ready, not when Dr. ""Late to golf"" wants them too.

This film is wonderful, informative, I cried, I sobbed, I turned to my husband and said ""that's an eye opener!"" Thank you Rickie for having the courage to show what you went through, and what childbirth can really be like as nature intended!

Watch this, you won't regret it.",1218672000,6,2489,4.357758620689655
3117661,5,B0013LL2XY,"""The Business of Being Born"" is a well done documentary that points out many eye opening facts about how the business of giving birth in the United States has gone awry. The information provided makes a lot of sense and has changed my views on the way giving birth should be performed. Using a midwife and home birth seem to be more beneficial to both the mother and her baby. ""The Business of Being Born"" gives many reasons why its beneficial for both mother and baby to have a midwife assist during labor. The medical establishment treats child birth like an unnatural medical condition and uses many unnecessary medical interventions to help speed along the birthing process. From watching this documentary, these medical interventions appear to have adverse consequences to both mother and child.

Some of the information shared in this documentary showed that 70% of the births in Europe and Japan are performed by midwives. Conversely, in the United States, approximately 1% of all births are performed by midwives. The United States has the highest infant and maternal mortality rate of all industrialized nations.

Giving birth is big business in the United States.... Doctors want you in and out of the hospital as quickly as possible to make room for the next woman to give birth. Doctors are performing more c-sections today than ever before. In the early 1970s around 4% of women had c-sections. Today something like 1 in 3 women are having c-sections in the United States. Having a c-section is major surgery with its own set of risks and complications. Many of the c-sections performed are unnecessary and some doctors perform/push c-sections in order to prevent malpractice lawsuits according what I saw in this documentary.

Midwives are very educated, highly trained specialists, whom have the interests of both the mother and baby at heart. They work with the mother's body and allow it to take the needed time to delivery the baby. It appears from watching this documentary that the women that used midwives had a better overall experience giving birth then that of those that used the obstetrics/hospital route. This is a highly enlightening documentary.",1217462400,,2174,5.033333333333333

3117665,4,B0013LL2XY,"*SPOILERS*

According to statistics, the infant mortality rate in the United States exceeds that of virtually every other nation in the industrialized world.  The U.S. is also the only place in which far more women give birth in hospitals than at home under the care of a professional midwife.  The documentary ""The Business of Being Born"" sees a connection between those two facts.

Executive producer Ricki Lake first conceived of this film after she delivered her first baby in the hospital and then felt cheated of the potentially beautiful and meaningful experience a home birth might have provided.  With the aid of director Abby Epstein, Lake has gathered together a group of women, couples, midwives and physicians who, through their own personal experiences and/or studies on the matter, help to provide evidence for her case that, for the large majority of women, delivering at home is preferable, on both a practical and spiritual level, to delivering in a hospital.  Lake has even allowed herself to be filmed in the process of giving birth to her second child at home.

This is an eye-opening and informative movie that admittedly provides really only one side to the issue.  But it makes a pretty convincing case for that side and certainly gets the audience thinking.  First, it offers a number of startling statistics, the prime one being that roughly one third of all babies born in America are now delivered through Caesarian Section, a procedure that is classified as ""major surgery"" but which is often treated with casual indifference by both physicians and patients (the shots of a Caesarian are far more ""gruesome"" than any of the shots of actual childbirth we are shown).  The movie also recounts a brief but somewhat disturbing history of obstetrics practices in the United States during the past century when many women were put into ""twilight sleep"" and missed the birthing experience entirely.  The movie also points out that, in a hospital setting, a ""cascade of interventions"" often prevents women from having the ultimate say in how they choose to deliver their babies. But the majority of the case is made through personal anecdotes from mothers and midwives concerning their own birthing experiences, as well as by the recording of many of those actual home births live on camera.  Interestingly, after all the successful home births, the movie ends on one in which the child arrives prematurely and is in a breach position and thus must enter the world in a hospital room after all.  It's an indication of the honesty and courage of the filmmakers that they didn't feel called upon to edit that sequence out of the movie.

Yet, for the most part, the film takes the multi-billion dollar medical industry to task for being too quick to use drugs and a scalpel in the birthing experience.  The movie also harshly criticizes the insurance industry for failing to recognize the much greater cost efficiency of home-birthing and hence refusing to cover it in their policies, thereby forcing many midwives to simply close up shop.

In many ways, ""The Business of Being Born"" is fighting something of an uphill battle in that it appears counterintuitive - especially to a generation raised on the belief that the medical industry can do anything - to suggest that a birthing process with a physician and modern medical equipment on hand could actually be less safe than a birthing process without them (though the movie is quick to point out that the midwives are all state-certified and trained to deal with any unforeseen complications that might arise).  Still, for women facing this decision - as well as for a society that for over a century now has frowned upon even the thought of natural childbirth - ""The Business of Being Born"" may serve as a paradigm-shifting event.",1215475200,15,3803,4.945054945054945

This movie helps you trust your body, even when western medicine says your body simply cannot birth a baby without intervention. These homebirths were calm and nurturing even though they were painful - the mother was in control of her environment! I feel much more prepared for birth after seeing these women's births. They are so kind to share their intimate experience with us. I would have liked much more discussion around the C-section. It was interesting to show that homebirth isn't always the best option, and if you need it, you can get a C-section and the baby will still be okay.

There just isn't enough time during class to really prove and show them what is really happening. This movie does a terrific job of educating people.

I'm glad there is finally a movie that shows home birth in a positive way.

I was fortunate enough to begin my career literally at the beginning of  ""baby classes"".  My early students were grateful and excited to have access to instruction in a how a birth could be achieved without the drugs they had come to hate, and which they were told would keep them from feeling anything.  More than one woman described herself as feeling like a piece of meat.  Well, that changed in my day, at least for a few years.  Women experienced the euphoria of what we seem to almost universally describe as ""empowerment"".  The ""I can do anything if I can birth my own baby"" feeling.  Now we seem to have devolved into an age when women don't want any responsibility in their birth, don't want to feel anything, don't want to put as much time into preparation for birth as they might put into preparation for the purchase of a  hair drier! And maybe, saddest of all, doctors live in such fear and/or desire to control the situation, that women , who are already highly susceptible to suggestion, go along with almost every order unquestioningly.

3117690,5,B0013LL2XY,"I absolutely LOVED this movie.  I had a homebirth that was wonderful and truly life altering.  After watching this movie, (actually, crying through it, I was so emotional) I realized that my birth experience is the thing I am most proud of in all my life.  As well, it was the most loving thing I could do for myself and my daughter.  My confidence in giving birth without drugs or interventions, with my husband and midwives supporting me, in my own bed, has made me realize there is nothing in the world I can't do.  I gave birth to a life as nature intended - that is probably the most powerful accomplishment of all.

Having a homebirth requires that the mother (and father) take responsibility for the pregnancy and the birth of their child.  It requires attention to diet, exercise and gaining knowledge about the process of birth.  A midwife is your guide, your support and your lifeline.  It's not the easier route, but it's definitely the most rewarding.

Imagine a world in which all women believe they can birth their babies without drugs and interventions.  Imagine a world where women anticipate, not dread their birth day.  Imagine a world in which women speak of their birth days as proud accomplishments, not of a distateful experience they had to endure.  It is the world I hope for.

This movie, if it can open the eyes of even a handful of women to choice and gentle birth, may just spark the change in childbirth perspectives needed so that we can get to that world I hope for.

Well it didn't at all.  It does provide very eye opening facts about the hospitals and rates of C-sections.  Very Very interesting stuff.

Even spiritual. I had control over how I wanted the experience to be and I never felt like myself or my baby was ever in any danger.
My second child was in a hospital (basically because my insurance wouldn't cover a midwife). I had little to no control, they did a lot of intervening and I ended up having a C-section that I thought was not necessary and completely avoidable. They wouldn't let me out of my bed and it's sort of hard to progress when you're flat on your back.  Because I wasn't progressing fast enough for them, it ended up being a much different and not pleasant experience.  I don't think that you have to have a home birth to be happy about how it goes but this at least gives you a great start in letting you know that you SHOULD be in control and that we need to speak up and be in charge of labor and delivery again. There are options out there and this film help you to realize that.  It was very inspirational. It could have been shortened a bit and I did find the F-word unnecessary.

3117697,5,B0013LL2XY,"Well Done Ricki Lake and Abby Epstein. It is great to see you giving the women the power to make educated and informed choices. I like the fact that it DOES show both sides of the story (interviews with both people for and against home births). It also shows that midwives aren't reckless hippies who will bar you from entering a hospital as the director herself found out when she was rushed to hospital on the advice of her midwife. It shows that yes birthing should be as natural as the mother chooses but if needed those highly skilled OB's come in and help (as it happens in other countries).
 I am an immigrant from one of those countries that has mainly midwife care, there is a huge difference in birth outcomes and more positive experiences from the gals I have spoken to. Giving birth seems less natural and more medical when done under the supervision of an OB hooked up to IV's and monitors which make it impossible to move around and be in more natural birthing posistions! Speaking of OB's I cant tell you how lost I was when I found out I was pregnant and the OB didn't want to see me until I was 10 WEEKS, I was horrified - especially since you can do alot of daamge to a fetus in 10 weeks!!!!!!! Midwives are fantastic and since they are geared up for natural births and not so much surgery they should be ideally used more often for low risk mothers and this doco shows these professionals in a good light (Finally).

3117698,5,B0013LL2XY,"After seeing 2 benefit screenings of the film, I am convinced it is a film that every single person in our country should see.  It's not just for women of child-bearing age.  When the profits from a maternity ward can make or break an entire hospital, we truly have a problem for the whole country - especially when so many people can't afford health care at all!

As a doula, I see too many mothers who don't understand the things being done to them (and not always FOR them) when they are in labor.  I see too many mothers with questions that aren't answered to their satisfaction.  I see too many mothers with too few options.

As good consumers, we research major purchases such as cars and houses, but very few of us have any choice about where and under whose care we deliver our children.  It's time we demand a voice and better choices for our own care!

While I am very glad we have the medical technology for birth available, not every birth warrants the use of most of that technology.  Birth is not a crisis waiting to happen - at worst, it is a natural disaster from which 97% of women know how to cope and recover from.  At best, it can be the most awesome experience you will ever have, and it should be that way for more women.

3117699,5,B0013LL2XY,"5 stars for being a timely piece: women NEED to learn the truths about childbirth and put it in context with the rest of the world and hundreds of years of history.  It was disturbing in some of the movie's early interviews that women said they wouldn't even consider using a midwife.  We are trained to expect birth to be traumatic and medicalized.

The only cons in this movie are more artistically centered and definitely LESS important than the need to see a movie like this in the first place.  E.g., the ending was anti-climatic with the director of the movie resorting to a hospital birth because the baby was breech.

I also agree with the reviewer who said more discusssion needed to happen about options when baby is in the less than ideal position... breech CAN be dealt w/ at home, for example.

I do NOT agree with the person who quoted the newspaper about the ""Michael Moore"" style editing. How insulting!  This movie SHOWS doctors who fully admit their limitations and expectations.  What's more, they show doctors of the opposite persuasion who question if home birth is safe since they don't do fetal monitoring etc.

I've had 3 hospital births and will never do it again.  The first 2 were with a midwife and it was fine... she was great w/ me.  But I still had to deal with hospital policies with the baby taken away for testing and having to get woken up in the middle of the night to be given painkillers.  I didn't know better. I, like too many women, figured that delivering a baby was something that just happened to you in a hospital like getting your tonsils taken out or something.

My third child was born with a traditional doctor in a hospital and it was a horrible experience.  They ignored my wishes, they insisted on a hep-lock, they refused to take my pitocin IV out after the birth and whenever I asked for it out, the nurse would ""go to check"" with the head nurse and never come back.  Or they'd soothe me ""sure, right after this bag.""  I had nurses who pretty much just strapped me to the monitoring and ignored me until I started moaning badly and then it was time to push.  I felt violated and without dignity the whole time.

It pains me that women expect this.  I have many friends who've birthed at home and it was the best experience in the world for them.  This movie needs to get in the hands of all expectant mothers just for the simple fact that they should CONSIDER other options and perhaps clear up their misconceptions about midwives being little more than some hippy babushka who comes in with herbs and potions.  Kudos to Ricki Lake for stepping us in the right direction.

3117700,5,B0013LL2XY,"I watched this movie and LOVED it.  I think it is a wonderful way of introducing the idea of midwifery, the crisis in current delivery practices, and how wonderful a natural childbirth can be.

I had both of my children in New York hospitals.  I was never pressured to have an epidural or pitocin, although pitocin was mentioned when I got to the hospital with no labor going, 14 hours after my water had broken.  I felt generally respected in my wishes. That said, I had my 2nd baby flat on my back and found the experience of pushing to be excruciatingly painful, largely due to my body position and due to the OB rushing my birth by trying to push back the lip of my cervix that last centimeter or so.  He was rushing me because he wanted my baby born on his shift, which was about to end.  While I can understand that, he compromised my comfort and birth experience for his own ends.

Generally, I think it is pretty crazy that women are being delivered by men who can't possibly have any idea of what the birth experience is like.  That description in the film of approaching a wall higher than any you have ever seen in your life and then somehow scaling it seemed to ring true to me. No man could possibly understand how that feels.

Birth is a very empowering experience, and it is also a great teacher for your first year with a new baby.  Labor teaches you to be in the moment, cope with each contraction, one at a time.  Many times when my daughter was a baby I felt this lesson to ring true. Rather than think too hard about the big picture I just focused on getting through the hour of crying, the next feeding, etc.

I applaud Ricki Lake for taking this on.  For showing us some absolutely beautiful birth scenes and for going after the current thinking head on.  Someone had to do it.  Our birth practices are truly in crisis.  When it comes to birth, I agree, less is more.  I wish I had had the courage to do a home birth with a midwife.  I wonder how much more positive and affirming my birth experiences might have been.",1205625600,8,2039,4.293193717277487
3117701,5,B0013LL2XY,"This is a letter I wrote my friend who missed the movie:

The documentary successfully conveys the theme, ""You're going to be transformed by your birth like it or not; it might as well change you for the good.""

I didn't count, but I guess about 30 or more women and two men came to the viewing on Sunday. About 2/3's I knew. The documentary showed excellent coverage of a few natural births purposely filmed for this project including Ricki Lake's birth, a midwife's reflection on her own birth, and others. These births with low profile midwives in attendance really emphasized the ecstasy and joy a mother feels after an unmedicated birth and connecting with the new baby. And it showed previously recorded segments of clips of Marsden Wagner, Ina May, Michael Odent, Robbie Davis-Floyd, and more all speaking on the problems with birth in American hospitals. It showed clippings and photos of the history of hospital birth: stirrups, scopolamine affect, tying women down to keep them in control. Showed segments of residents on rounds (which could have been in any hospital I've been in residency) totally clueless how to meet the needs of their laboring women. It was quick and fast moving, emotional and funny.

The Filmer, Abby Epstein, was pregnant during the making of this documentary. She was under an OB's care, until the 35 week check-up when she told him she was going with the homebirth midwife. On this day it shows Ricki Lake commenting on her small gravid abdomen. The very next day she went in to labor with a breech. The midwife transferred to the hospital and her OB did a C. The audience seem to conclude that sometimes ""you need a hospital."" Abby herself said, something like everything was wrong, preterm labor, breech, cord around the neck, IUGR-- the typical things a women says after a C. One of the reasons I took advantage of the second showing is that I wanted to follow the dialogue of her pregnancy better. It was apparent to me after a second viewing that chronic maternal malnourishment was the problem(not a last minute freak accident) and it was passed onto the baby and the birth outcome. Necessarily and sadly it showed the disruption in bonding and breastfeeding of this birth. I also saw a different attitude with Abby at the beginning than the other women, ""this movie one of Ricki's crazy ideas."" I don't think at first she fully appreciated what ""Birth"" means. I think she does now, but I don't think she did when she was pregnant. Not unlike most American women. Kudos to her for being brave to show all this in her movie.

I don't know if everyone noticed, but I noticed that the starring midwife did not wear gloves at the births (some water, some squatting). I am not sure what most Americans would think viewing this or would they even observe this detail. Other midwifes wore gloves, though. An out-of-town midwife at the second showing I went to, pointed out that this would probably be something the midwife and couple would have to discuss before hand.

Two women in the movie were squatting/standing when they delivered their baby. It reminded me of you standing/breastfeeding and holding your newborn. Definitely not what you see everyday. Two women, one in water and one of these women squatting were so internally focused (and not screaming) when the midwife asked the moms to reach down for their baby and pull him to their chest, I don't think the women even realized the baby came out. Beautiful births! All these ecstatic outcomes brought me back to my emotions with Scott and David being brought to my chest.

A tissue box was passed around the room. It was nice to be in a group with so many pregnant wanting this info and babies being held in slings and laps and not in containers.  The out-of-town midwife had a lot of insight to my probing.

I almost feel envious of the women who are pregnant who will have such a wonderful experience in the near future.",1205020800,13,3920,4.704081632653061
3117702,5,B0013LL2XY,"This is an excellent film.  I would encourage all expectant couples to watch this film together to expand your knowledge of birthing options.  We had a hospital birth with both a doula and midwife. It was a great experience and I would consider a home birth for our next child.
However, the movie could have given more information about doulas.  Our doula was a very positive and important part of our birth experience",1204934400,3,418,4.698630136986301
3117703,3,B0013LL2XY,"This film starts a discussion that our society needs to have, for that I commend it to you. However, like many recent documentaries, it is one-sided (in favor of midwifery), makes some questionable claims, and ""indulges in the kind of stunt footage for which Michael Moore routinely gets slapped"" (Chicago Tribune review).  For example, when the medical establishment is represented in the film, the individuals are usually self-critical - supporting the film's agenda - and they are rarely given the opportunity to rebut the many claims made against the medical practice. For instance, the so-called experts in the film talk about the power disparity and physician paternalism in the OB clinic; they claim that many obstetricians don't have the patients' best interests in mind and will do anything to drag them into the operating room to have a C-section (because this is most convenient for the doctors). This may be true in some cases, but it was not true in ours. Moreover, I find it hard to believe that in the modern climate of patient-centered practice that physicians on the whole are exercising this kind of influence and making these sorts of decisions. I think they are more interested in providing adequate patient care and creating a positive experience for each mom (which, by the way, has the upshot of increasing business and avoiding malpractice suits). In addition, the new buzz word among professionals and in popular literature these days is ""the birth plan."" Pregnant mothers are encouraged to have one, which means spelling out exactly how they want the labor and delivery to go. Furthermore, in our experience, the delivery nurses were great, and they fulfilled the role that a midwife or a doula might. Finally, many of the talking heads in the film pontificate that women who go into the hospital to give birth are ""missing the experience"" of what it means to truly be a woman and give birth the natural way. I find this judgmental attitude almost as offensive as those who argue that epidurals are wrong on the basis that the Bible says women ought to feel pain in childbirth since the Fall. My advice: consider both midwifery and the hospital and go with the option that works best for you. You could have a good or bad experience either way, so ask around for recommendations.",1204848000,24,2305,4.8951406649616365
3117704,5,B0013LL2XY,"This documentary does a wonderful job of introducing the ideas that motivate those who are working for change in the birth system in this country.  The filmmakers have really portrayed the reasons that many ""mainstream"" families are opting for birth outside the hospital setting in a way that makes them easy to process.  And they have done this without vilifying those who have hospital births and medical interventions.

Having had both a birth in a typical US hospital and a homebirth I can say that I would recommend that any healthy woman having a normal pregnancy seriously consider birthing outside of a hospital.  The care I received from my midwife was far superior to that from my obstetrical team and giving birth at home had positive effects not only for myself and the new baby, but for my husband and our first child as well.  The whole family benefited from the experience.  I only wish I'd seen this film before having my first baby!",1204761600,46,949,4.7560975609756095
3117705,4,B0013LL2XY,"The film does a good job of explaining the ""intervention cycle"" that is so common in medicalized births--the mother is hooked up to intravenous tubes and all sorts of technology, and thus there is inevitable pressure to use (or misuse that technology).  Anesthetics, which are supposed to ease the pain, lead to slowdown in the birth process, which leads to more intervention (pitocin etc.) and oftentimes to ""crisis"" into which the physician steps to save the day.  The film gives a fair amount of attention to the power of the physician over against the mother in medicalized birth.  The portrayal of the respectful and extremely helpful manner in which home birth midwives work comes across very well.

We give the film a four-star rating instead of five for several reasons.  We think it does not do quite well enough at explaining the reasons why home birthers do certain things--for example, why they often choose water birth.  Why husbands/partners might not wear a shirt when assisting the mother.  Why the home setting is generally superior to the hospital setting in terms of exposure to dangerous microbes.  There are good reasons for all these things, but they're not really explained in the film.

We think the film dwells excessively on the experiences of the director (Cara) and upon Ricki Lake.  It's fine to have these folks profiled in the film we just think they take too much screen time that could have been better used educate people further about non-medicalized birth.  This is one reason that the film starts to languish a bit in the second half.  Some of the language used on the film (casual swearing) will be unnecessarily offensive to many home birthers and potential home birthers.  The film did not mention the religious reasons some people choose home birth (we'd have loved to see interviews with Amish home birthers, for example).  We did think the contributions of Michael Odent, Ina Gaskin, and the other midwives (and the back-up doctor) were portrayed very well.

We have had six home births (four with well-trained midwives).  Our midwives definitely went the extra mile for us, and were genuinely interested not only in ""getting the baby out"" but in all aspects of prenatal, delivery, and early infant care.  They were extremely generous in their time and expertise.  In terms of theoretical and practical knowledge, our trained midwives were the equal if not superior to the typical birth-attending physician.  This perspective comes across pretty well on the film.

All in all, this is a good film.  It could be quite a bit better in terms of explaining non-medicalized birth to people who are unfamiliar with it.  But it's a good start and we recommend it to anyone interested in the topic.",1204502400,119,2733,4.934354485776805
3350686,5,B0013LL2XY,"I just watched this online.  It was incredible!  I thought it was well written and directed.  This film offers an insightful and informative view into the world of birthing and the limited choices women have.  I would recommend to anyone, not just women of child bearing age, but anyone so that you can make an educated decision regarding the birth of your child.  It helps to know that a woman can do a natural birth if she has the support of others.  Too often, doctors and hospitals do not explain the effects of c sections on the mom and the baby.  It is not a celebrity trend that you should use to decide how you birth, learn about it for yourself.  You have to learn to read, to drive, watch this to learn about your options.  It is fantastic to have doctors available in emergencies, that is what they are there for, but to medicate a natural process? Not in my opinion, but this movie helps clarify these points in an open way, not negatively.",1203984000,15,952,4.394285714285714

Well.. thank God I did that, thank God I got the epidural, the c-section, etc... The film helped me set false expectations & only increased my idealism surrounding this whole ""miraculous"" nutty crunchy event... by the time my own hodgepodge birth was over I felt like a complete failure... my son wouldn't breastfeed which only added to these feelings and I think movies like this, while informative, also just really set people up for disappointment and it's only 4 years later that it's dawning on me how absolutely ""non-failure-like"" I should've felt and would've felt.. had I NOT watched movies like this BEFORE giving birth!!!",1490832000,2,919,4.859872611464968

The film makes some excellent points about birthing culture in the US. However, there is so much left out. Mainly, it leaves out a lot of the birthing process (with or without midwives) and does not address the impacts of litigation on birthing culture.
There was no scene showing the delivery of the placenta, suturing of vaginal tears, or dealing with post-postpartum hemorrhage (#1 cause of maternal death worldwide). In the majority of deliveries mothers have tears in their vaginas which the midwives suture right after the placenta is delivered. After the placenta is delivered the uterus has to be massaged in order ensure there in no hemorrhaging. If there is, the midwife will give intramuscular shot of pitocin to cause the uterus to contract which help control the bleeding. It's crazy to me that this birthing documentary leaves out the entirety of the birthing process just because the final parts are much less glamorous.
There was not a single mention of all the litigation experienced by obstetricians and how that has impacted the way babies are delivered. So much of the way medicine is practiced today is influenced by the growing amount of litigation against physicians in general. Defensive medicine.

Do not use this movie as a primary source for deciding between at home and in hospital births!  Go talk to your local hospital to see the benefits vs the costs.",1438214400,8,803,4.824817518248175

Know what kind of birth you want & the true SAFE  options you have.

I found this video after so many questions about birth & seeing my friends' horrible birth experiences resulting in C-sections & learning that in the current city we were living in there was an 80% c-section rate! We no longer live there but it got me wondering if 80% of the women there really needed that c-section.  Plus I had plenty of friends who had safe, healthy natural births in both birthing centers & at home.

It got me thinking.  Then, I found this video & started doing my own research.

Two naturally, unmedicated vaginal births later (one with a hospital transfer but still vaginal w/ 6hr labor & natural & one birthing center water birth w/ 4.5hr labor), we are on our third pregnancy and planning a home birth (mostly because we don't think we will risk trying to make it to town this time).

Before you assume things, know your facts & know what is safe & what is not....watch this video & the other mini series called ""More on the Business of Being Born"" on Netflix.

My experiences & knowledge has helped several other moms in my area to do the actual research & choose to birth without epidural & at a birthing center or at home safely.

You really do not need to watch a movie about how hospitals are in the business of money, not hopes and dreams. This movie does a great job of trying to get as many perspectives from medical professionals and non-medical professionals alike, to both disagree and agree with them. A woman who never sets foot in a hospital, does not get a bill from a hospital. The fear factor associated with giving birth naturally is apparent when you ask most American women or mothers who have given birth via c-section, after having no other issues up until the moment they were admitted to the hospital. The insurance companies do not make money if no one pays the premiums. Low-risk mothers are perfectly capable of giving birth with the what if factor lingering in the air. Women who fear giving birth will have a harder time giving birth. The most dangerous thing we do every day is drive a car. The whole natural birth thing strikes extreme fear in someone who has lost a loved one due to a car accident. Yet, we drive everyday. Our priorities are messed up. High-risk women need OB/GYNs.

3351132,2,B0013LL2XY,"There is nothing wrong with wanting a natural birth, whether at home, a birthing center, or a hospital. A good documentary would informed its viewers of the pro and cons of each decision and the circumstances under which a decision can be either good or bad. That is not the approach this film took. Have you watched a Michael Moore film? That's what my experience with this was like.

As other's have noted, it's biased. I would argue extremely biased. I will include information that the film should have presented, but didn't, for whatever reason.

The beginning of the film starts with statistics, namely that the US hospital birthing system is in crisis and that out of all the industrialized nations, the US has the worst infant mortality rate. Here's the problem with that statement, infant mortality is the wrong statistic to use when discussing birth. Perinatal mortality, or intranatal mortality is proper. Infant mortality is a measure of infant death starting anywhere from 1 week after birth to one month after birth until one year later. It is true that the US does not fare well, but that is due to the large underclass in this country (i.e., poor mothers, with poor health, and poor access to healthcare). When you exam perinatal mortality, the US is quite high; a lot higher than many of the European countries cited in the film (we are tied for 3/4 best according to WHO). Personally, I believe that the filmmaker and Rickie Lake (yes, she helped make this film) should have known that distinction, however, since it undercuts their point, I can see the motivation for the confusion. I would like to point this out since they film was wrong about it: the Netherlands has the second HIGHEST perinatal mortality rate in western Europe. They are NOT better that the US.

Regarding perinatal stats in the US, anyone can access this information. The CDC keeps track of it (search CDC Wonder) and you can compare the perinatal mortality for hospital born and home born children deliver by physicians, certified nurse midwives (CNM), and other midwives. The data are quite clear, the perinatal mortality for hospital born infants to either a physician or CNM are three times LOWER than a home birth with a typical midwife (0.57 per 1000 versus 1.73-2.06 per 1000). Another note about these numbers; if a complication arises at a home birth and you are transferred to the hospital and the infant or the mother dies/experiences some sort of morbidity, the stat is counted toward the hospital, not home birth. So these numbers likely underestimate the mortality and morbidity of home births and and overestimate them for hospital births, which already include most high-risk mothers.

This leads me another oversight on their part. They treat all midwives the same. They are not. As I mentioned above, there are certified nurse midwives and other midwives (typically licensed midwives (LM), certified professional midwives (CPM), and direct entry midwives (DEM)). The film points out that nearly 70% of European countries use midwives for births while the US only does it 8% of the time. They, then tie this in with infant mortality. I already established that infant mortality is misleading since factors not related to birth are the primary cause for that. What is also neglected is that the training of European midwives is vastly superior than for most American midwives. In the US we have two classes of Midwives, the CNM and the rest that I mentioned. Only the CNM are as qualified or more qualified than European midwives. CNM require a master's level training and, since they are actual nurses, they have medical training, just like the European midwives. The other types of midwives (DEM, LM, CPM) didn't even require a high school education until 2012! Also, many of these types were the study at home, take a test to get certification, types. If you plan on using a midwife, PLEASE only look at CNMs, as they have the training comparable to Europe's midwives. Also, CNM have connections to hospitals, so if a complication arises, they have access to proper facilities and don't have to rely on the ER. Of note, the perinatal mortality for CNM is comparable to physicians. Lastly, about this issues. by training, CNM (and the other midwives) only take on low-risk mothers. High risk are almost always handled at hospitals. The film neglects to mention this as well, and make it appears as if all women can and should have home births.

The film also mentions that maternal mortality is higher than many other industrialized nations, which is true. The film does not elaborate on why that is. The major causes of maternal mortality globally and in the US used to be due to hemorrhage, preeclampsia, and blood clots. These causes have been declining in this country for years now and are at their lowest rates. What is contributing to maternal mortality are PRE-EXISTING medical conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cardiomyopathy, etc as well as women getting pregnant in later life (which at age 35 is considered high risk by default). Again, this has nothing to do with where you give birth or who delivers your baby. The reality is there are no maternity intensivist and other resources devoted to handle the growing population of already sick pregnant women. In contrast, the perinatal mortality rate has dropped so much in this country because of the development of neonatology in the 1950s along with NICU's, etc.

Other misleading aspects include the showing of hospital scenes out of context. For example, to create the impression that the reason C-sections are so common in this country (33%) is because doctors don't want to wait for labor to run its course and to get as many mothers as possible in and out of the hospital to pad their bank accounts. While I'm sure there are some who do that, the idea that the majority of doctors are that ethically compromised and that the majority of midwives are ethically and morally superior is ridiculous. FYI, C-section is just as common in Europe as the US, so either those midwife using Europeans are just as financially motivated as US doctors, or the financial argument is a gross oversimplification of the issue. Also, in the US, the risk of complication for a vaginal birth is 8.6% while a C-section is 9.2%, a .06% difference, hardly the great evil the film portrays it to be. When it comes to wanting to avoid a C-section, education yourself of the legitimate, emergency situations that you need one so that you can direct your care. The same goes with the drugs that are administered during labor. The film presents a ""cascade"" of drugs that they suggest inevitably leads to a C-section. Again, if it were only that simple. FYI, pitocin is just oxytocin. It has the same effect on the body as the natural stuff. Like any externally administered drug, natural or otherwise, there are risk and benefits. Again, just know about the legitimate reasons to use it, such as when labor is stalled. Again, since the C-section is just as high in Europe, there is no mention of the same ""cascade"" practiced used there.

Much of the hospital births they show to make their points are actually of women who chose to INDUCE labor, hence the reliance on drugs, etc. What research shows is that induced labor reduces the incidence of C-section (just search for this article-Use of labour induction and risk of cesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis).

They also spend a lot of time of showing black and white clips and pictures of how barbaric medicine used to be. As if that barbarism reflects current understanding and practice. That would be like me showing clips of how mentally ill patients used to be treated with lobotomies, insulin injections, and hydrotherapy to critique contemporary mental health treatment. Just because things were bad, doesn't mean they still are bad.

The ultimate irony comes at the end. The filmmaker was pregnant during filming. Before she was in labor, she knew that her son was breached. She decided to try the home birth anyway. As you might predict, she needed an emergency C-section at a hospital in the ER and her son spent 3 weeks in the NICU before coming home.

I could go on. This is what you need to know. Decide what your birthing goals are. Then do your research. Then create a backup plan, if needed. Unfortunately, I would NOT recommend this film to anyone since it is so cherry picked and misleading. Many of the people in this film show the same arrogance and scientific ignorance as anti-evolution, anti-vaccination, anti-GMO, anti-climate change types. They all appeal to fear and distort the truth. There is just so much important information that could have easily been included if they skipped trying to scare the crap out of you.",1412121600,9,8790,4.869652406417113

When they talk about the statistics of The Farm, with Ina Mae, they talk about The Farm's wonderful C-section rate, but don't give us their death rate. What good is a low C section rate if their death rate is through the roof?! I have to question why this isn't given to us. I have tried looking into it online and I cannot find the information.

3351233,5,B0013LL2XY,"I can see the strong argument for some of its shortcomings presented by the couple in another review, but for reaching a wider audience with its powerful message, I couldn't give this film any less than 5 stars.  I'd heard it referenced in the past few years but didn't search it out until my partner and I began to make plans to grow our family.  My first trips to doctors to address what may or may not be conditions impacting my pregnancy and childbirth were astonishing.  The doctor who quite literally laughed in my face when I told him of my hope to deliver naturally (unmedicated), and asked why I'd want to put myself through that ""pain and suffering""!!  He then impressed upon me that I should abandon all hope of even a vaginal delivery from any private practice doctor, since the cesarean rate was now up to 45% in the US.  And then he explained why, with absolutely no trace of shame.  I was floored and sought out to make the case for my body and my baby.
This film appears to be a very good first stop.  It has opened plenty of areas for further research and helped fueled my conviction that I have a responsibility to advocate for myself and my child in a system wrought with serious problems.  Thanks to the filmmakers for this powerful film.  Oh, and incidentally, unlike for some other reviewers, I have no problem with the often-appearance of those women in the film.  The subject couldn't be more personal and I think the case if made stronger by their personal experience with it.

My four children were born between the years 1969 and 1982 and though I am a nurse and was vaguely aware of care delivery options and changes extending into obstetrics, this documentary was a sad shock.....our lives move on and I assumed much had at least stayed the same-not regressed!

I think many hospital birthing centers have improved in their policies so it really depends on the hospital that you are using.  Homebirth probably is a great option for many but I feel like this video doesn't give the disadvantages of home birth or the risks that apply there.  Childbirth in the US definitely needs improvement but I'm not sure if home birth is the key.  The video is very useful though in giving soem great statistics and helping people make a more informed decision about interventions during childbirth.",1396828800,,716,4.658730158730159

3351266,1,B0013LL2XY,"Beware this video, or any saying how easy or great natural childbirth is. It appears to be factual and well balanced but it hides some really important facts. My wife just attempted a home-birth after watching this video, $4000 later plus a lot of extreme pain we did a 30 minute hospital transfer with my wife screaming in agony the whole way to the hospital. Here are the things that we learned during our birthing experience which aren't covered in any of the videos in this series:-

i) Midwives are not legally allowed to administer pain medication, other than cannabis which doesn't even touch the intense pain,
so even if you have a really relaxed you may still experience a lot of pain which could be treated in a hospital.

ii) Midwifes can't always turn the baby even though they will tell you that they can.

iii) Using an epidural actually can help the cervix dilate as well as greatly reducing the pain. This was a big one for us because just staying at home with the midwife natural birth just wouldn't have been possible but it would have been in a hospital.

iv) Hospitals these days really do try to help mothers have a natural childbirth in relaxed settings rather than leaping to C-sections but they have the advantage of proper medical backup if needed. Again this was a big surprise, we used Kaiser, from this video we expected to be rushed to the operating room at 10pm.

v) The higher instance of C sections and mortality in hospitals is because midwives cherry-pick the easiest births, also the midwife failures end up in hospital and count as part of the hospital statistics.",1391126400,14,1600,4.639575971731449

We both found it to be a fresh take on the journey of being pregnant as well as the process of delivery.  I personally appreciated that an alternate viewpoint is presented without sacrificing substantial evidence for and against each choice of delivery. I must say that I have to agree with the storyline of the film completely.  Currently 8 months pregnant, I have witnessed both sides of this argument.  I started with a traditional OBGYN as my care provider in early pregnancy and often felt that I was being rushed as well as kept in the dark during my appointments.  Never, did I feel well taken care of.  My recent switch to a certified Midwife brings an entirely new excitement and anticipation to birth.

For just about any other movie, I would have given up because I was SO irritated and frustrated.  But this movie was worth all that hair-pulling aggravation.  Having studied, for over 12 years, brain development from prenatal through infancy through the lens of traumatic events, I can assure anyone that babies DO remember - via implicit memory (vs explicit), and there is an astounding amount of trauma that is inflicted on the baby in the process of medicalized childbirth.  Trauma is also inflicted on the mother to a lesser extent, but all these traumas interfere monumentally with the bonding process which is so critical for creating healthy brain pathways in infants.  Dr. Michel Odent (French obstetrician featured in the film) can tell you about these traumas in detail, and his work is worth studying for those who wish to know more.  Highly recommended.

I think for women who are planning on having a natural birth in a hospital setting and are comfortable with your doctors...this movie will give you second thoughts and make you question your decision.  That is not an ideal situation when labor is right around the corner.  It does make you question the trust you have in your healthcare providers.  As a healthcare provider, I welcome questions and feedback from the healthcare consumers I serve and I believe my doctors value that as well.  It does give you plenty of food for thought.",1378339200,,725,4.4961832061068705
3351334,5,B0013LL2XY,Unfortunately conventional healthcare system makes moms-to-be feel like there's only one choice. Absolutely not true. So more choices to even count. Most important question about any test or procedure or protocol: why is this done? Is it medically necessary?,1378166400,,258,5.641025641025641
3351335,5,B0013LL2XY,"So, I watched this movie.  I have read a number of the 1 star reviews and checked out one movie recommended there - Childbirth Without Violence.  But everyone on Netflix was either creeped out or very bored by that movie.

What astounded me in this movie was that women could actually have babies without intense screaming and agony and wailing and begging for pain medicine.  Childbirth was always portrayed to me as awful and ungodly painful.  It didn't sound like anything I would ever be capable of.  But the women at home just had the babies very fast.  Whoosh!  And a baby is there!  With a 2 year old walking around in the background!  No screaming and no torture.  No failing arms and pushing.  Just a baby right there!  It was easy!

I DO think women need to see THAT regardless of anything ELSE in the movie.  Because that IS empowering.  Yes, we CAN have children ourselves.  The doctor is NOT the one having the child for us.  And I do think the fact that the film maker had to go to the hospital just showed that the midwives DO work well with the hospital system.

I'm amazed how angry people are about this.  Calling the film maker names?  Why can't midwives be good for some things and doctors for others?  Midwives were stamped out in the 30s.  We never hear of them now.  So a movie in favor of them is needed.  What's to get all wound up about?  I don't get it.  I think the doctors can protect themselves just fine!  :-)  They aren't going out of business anytime soon.",1378166400,2,1489,4.3713235294117645

3351341,5,B0013LL2XY,"Thank you Ricki Lake and Abby Epstein for making this most amazing documentary.  It is an eye opener.  If you have been healthy and haven't learned how the medical system processes you like chicken, you need to learn how your choices are being removed from the most natural experience you can have.

Unlike some reviewers, I think this was a very accurate portrayal about how the medical community sees your childbirth experience as a money making venture.  Like so many things wrong in our medical care, we spend so much in the U.S. and yet, the level of care received is subpar.

Consider these scary statistics covered in this film; nearly 95% of all births in the U.S. are now scheduled Caesareans while 5% are natural childbirth.  This is the reverse of Great Britain, Norway, Switzerland, Netherlands, France, Germany and Japan and a few other Industrial nations.  Our infant mortality in the U.S. is very high, higher than ANY Industrial nation and worse than some 3rd world nations.  Why?  Because, the doctors find doing so is easier for them.  One fact showed that across the NYC metro area, the highest incidence of Caesarians occurred at 4:00pm and 10:00pm.  The conclusion they came to was that Doctors want to get home and have dinner and 10:00pm is that the doctors consider the labor may go into the night and they want their sleep.  Gee, hate to inconvenience y'all being that you are so important, after all it is only a new precious life and the mom's well being at stake.

The more Caesareans preformed the greater risk of complications for mother.  Again, who cares right?

When the dozen or so the Gynecologists/OBGYN doctors were interviewed only one had witnessed a non-induced birth.  It is not a part of the curriculum in Medical Schools, shame on the medical community!  How appalling that what has existed for 10,000 years has been phased out in 100 years.  The doctor, who had witnessed natural childbirth was an advocate of it.  He is back-up to at least one Midwife.

I worked in the insurance industry for several years and was outspoken at the frustration I experienced at a well-known HMO that gave doctors act like God.  Some actually do, they absolutely drive the choices in the health care system (or better stated, the lack there of).  When the one female doctor said that her mentor told her when in doubt do a C-section because no one will question you, I found that very disturbing and revealing.  My sister was an intensive care neo-natal nurse and an intensive care cardiology nurse in major regional hospitals.  The horror stories I heard makes me a believer that this is the thought process for many doctors.  Furthermore, the insurance companies will stall claims for those who have natural childbirth even when it is pre-approved (boy, did I see that during my career - it made me so angry I left to went to work for a Fortune 100 company to manage their healthcare plans.  Though it averages $10,000 less in cost to use a Midwife compared to an average delivery in a hospital setting ($14,000 in 2008) because the insurance companies bow to the AMA pressure, they are causing financial hardship on the Midwife community.  Many have chosen to go out of business than fight with the insurance companies over payment, in fact, it is so bad, many can't afford to keep their doors open because all the staff they require to handle billing.

While one reviewer complains that New York City doesn't reflect smaller communities; no one can argue that NYC sets the trends for many different communities over time. I live in a large metro area and a birthing center that was open when I moved here more than 25 years ago, just recently closed.  There are only two in a Metro Area which consists of more than 1 million people!

One of the saddest things is that the drugs put additional stress on the baby's heart.  When women asked what the risks were they were given flippant non-specific words like ""low or minimal"".  When a woman is in crisis she is going to trust the expert, e.g. the doctor.  Furthermore, the main drug used blocks the release of natural hormones which occurs at the time of delivery.  The hormonal cocktail has oxytocin (the same chemical released at orgasm).  This chemical causes a natural high for Mom through the release of endorphins (which help the mom recover from the pain) and it also is found to be a strong bonding mechanism that gives rise to a protective instinct for the newborn's safety and needs.  One question raised, is what happens when those chemicals aren't released?  Some women, who had both natural and induced labor state there is a huge difference in their interactions with their child.

One thing the video didn't explore much was the impact on the father's to be able to empathize with the woman at the time of labor and delivery.  All men were very excited but imagine the difference you experience witnessing the birth of your child at home!  This is a very big moment for him as well.  The same experience isn't had in an operating room, no one can argue that.",1375056000,,5053,4.703071672354949

3351371,5,B0013LL2XY,"I absolutely love and enjoyed this movie to the max, and I highly recommend it to anyone that is expecting a child or know someone that is. The United States is truly in the midst of a ""birthing crisis"", where many medical professionals treat pregnancy as a disease, or rather, a condition that needs treatment. Not as a completely natural event that all women are completely capable of handling...if given the chance! We were born with the innate knowledge of birthing our offspring, if we let our instincts guide us, instead of an OB/Gyn that will make every attempt to control your pregnancy and your birth. Letting the OBs intervene even once, as they also pointed out in this amazing movie, will cause a snow-ball effect of never ending interventions, and you WILL lose control of your own birth without even realizing it.
Bottom line, this movie will guide you through our current shambles of a birthing community and you will walk away with more knowledge then you ever thought would be necessary to know. It's your body...shouldn't you know everything about ""The Business of Being Born"" before trusting yourself blindly to an OB and going with everything that they say?

3351389,3,B0013LL2XY,"I had an emergency c-section with my first son because he wasn't tolerating labor. I received an epidural after being in labor for 14 hours.  I just couldn't tolerate the pain any more.  I was having major contractions (the nurse said the intensity was what they would expect when women are at 8cm), but they weren't doing anything to dilate my cervix.  When my son's heartbeat started declining, they suggested I have an epidural to relax me.  They suspected that because I was bracing myself during every contraction that I was not relaxed enough to let the contraction do its job, and it was causing stress to my son.  Fifteen minutes after getting the epidural, I had an adverse reaction to it.  My blood pressure crashed, and my son's oxygen levels started declining as did his heart rate.  Once they got me stabilized, they tried to do some things to stabilize my son, but they didn't work.  So I ended up with an emergency c-section.  He had the cord wrapped around his neck several times, and the low amniotic fluid (my water broke at 1cm) wasn't providing any cushion to the cord.  They suspected he was trapped in the pelvis, and that is why my cervix wasn't dilating past 5 cm.

Fast forward a couple of years....When I got pregnant with my second son, I investigated all of my options starting with this video.  While I think it's important to understand the history of obstetrics in our country, I was a little disappointed in the slant of this video.  It was not objective - in my opinion.  It portrays all doctors and hospitals as money-grubbing facilities that only want to get you in and out much like a fast food establishment.  While they did show a lady who ended up at the hospital after her stay-at-home birth didn't pan out, their intent was to focus on how awesome  home birth can be.  They make it sound like any woman should consider home birth.  Well...I don't think so.  After researching all of my options, I elected for a repeat c-section.  I am very happy I chose that way for my son to be born.  The things that happened with my first son also happened during the birthing process of my second son.  I had an adverse reaction to the epidural.  My second son was slightly bigger than my first, and my doctor told me that my second son could not fit through my pelvis, which was why I had been in labor off / on for a couple of days.  They suspected my pelvis was too small with my first, but since I had other complications they weren't 100% sure that was the reason he wasn't tolerating labor.  If I had chosen to give birth at home or a birthing center, there is a very real chance that my son would have gotten stuck in my pelvis and died.  I could have died.  If I would have listened to this video, I would have mistrusted my doctor when he said he would not recommend a VBAC due to the complications in my first birth.

Unfortunately I have a friend who had a c-section with her son because he was failing to thrive.  When she got pregnant with her daughter, she researched things as I had done.  She had 3 different doctors that told her they would not do a VBAC because of the risk since her first son was failure to thrive.  So she decided to go to a birthing center and use a midwife.  Right before she was supposed to start pushing, they lost the baby's heartbeat.  She ended up at the hospital and delivered a stillborn daughter.  If she had trusted her doctors, she would have been holding her daughter instead of planning a funeral.

Are some of the statistics they present in this video accurate?  Yes.  But keep in mind that just because there is a correlation doesn't mean that it is the cause.  For instance, more ice cream is bought in warmer months.  Warmer months don't cause increased consumption of ice cream.  It's just a correlation.  They are related, but they are not cause and effect.",1367020800,10,3843,4.4406294706723894
3351390,5,B0013LL2XY,"I would consider this documentary educational, interesting and moving. Anyone expecting or considering pregnancy should watch it. Though as many of the VERY heated comments explain it is biased. If you are someone who lets one movie shape the rest of your life and you base everything you know upon that, without doing any other research then that is your mistake. I do believe home birth or even unmedicated birth isn't talked about as much as it should be and this documentary obviously did a lot to get women talking. I don't believe it is untruthful or unnecessarily bashes doctors but more explains the American birthing system, most of which is true. Personally I believe any medication, when not necessary, is simply that, unnecessary. I don't pop a pill every time i get a stomach ache or my head hurts nor should you opt for a c-section when unnecessary. It is not my personal choice to give birth to my baby in my living room with my other children watching but I would never slam a mom who does. I am a high risk pregnancy and so I will give birth in a hospital but under my birth plan. There is nothing wrong with monitoring my baby and myself while I labor AND doing so unmedicated, and this is my plan. There is also nothing wrong with me or my doctor if a c-section absolutely has to be preformed. Im not going to beat myself up about it either way. Educate yourself, watch this documentary and many others, read all the books and make up your own mind at the end of the day. Lets not be irrational people. Everyone leaving negative comments is making themselves look just as bad and biased as they believe the movie to be. If you don't agree, don't watch it, and don't give a bad rating because ""it wasn't what you expected"" that is completely unhelpful to anyone educated enough to read the description.",1366675200,2,1820,4.5181818181818185

3351409,5,B0013LL2XY,"The Business of Being Born is a documentary made in 2008 by Ricki Lake and Abby Epstein. Inspired by her own birth experiences, celebrity Ricki started to educate herself about birth through every avenue possible. Her friend and film maker, Abby, came along side her in the process and they produced this film together to share what they learned about birth, maternity care, obstetrics and midwifery in the United States.

The Business of Being Born includes many interviews by professionals including OB/GYNs, midwives, nurse midwives, mothers, fathers and doulas. Ricki shares her birth experiences and how she chose to have a home birth with her second baby. Abby and Ricki also follow a nurse midwife Care around and film two home births with her as attendant. One is of a first time mother who shares how she arrived at choosing a home birth and another of a second time mother's water birth. Cara is calm, competent, insightful and sheds a lot of light on the subject of birth and midwifery in NYC and the U.S. at large. If your used to birth as shown in Call the Midwife, this documentary will feel very raw and real-- nothing is left out. A cesarean section is also shown which can be shocking for anyone who has not seen one before.

My most favorite component of the documentary is that they put the history of birth in perspective. How we ended up where we are is vital to understanding the current state of things. I highly recommend Deliver Me from Pain if you are interested in more history on midwifery, birth and how, why, and when obstetrical interventions were invented.

I witnessed this film hit the shelves and create ripples all through out the birth community, and the world at large really, as many unfamiliar with birth and modern maternity care watched the film, some with awe and others plain shock.

I personally enjoy and appreciate the documentary for this very reason. The Business of Being Born starts at the bottom and works up for those who are unfamiliar with current birth practices and politics. And guess what, that is nearly everyone! The importance of knowing what is going on in the hospital near you is vital to a safe and good birth experience. Hospitals offer services to expectant families and we should know the facts in order to make wise decisions as consumers. What doctors, midwives and hospitals do is not the same all across the board. If everyone was practicing evidence based care, all doctors and midwives would be doing the same thing the entire world over! That is certainly not the case. The fact that doctors and midwives don't agree shows that some are practicing evidence based medicine and some are not, and all have their reasons for doing so. Is it money? Is it politics? Is it tradition? I am not saying one way or the other but I think it is worth thinking about.

 I love that Ricki and Abby stuck their necks out there and said some things that would make people mad for the sake of opening people's eyes to the reality of what is going on close to home. Ricki and Abby use current statistics to compare the U.S. to rest of the developed world-- and the U.S. doesn't do very well! For many, this is a huge shocker as our culture has a lot of faith in doctors and hospitals. To think that faith is not substantiated is hard.

Many people didn't like the fact that statistics were shared saying that it was placing fear where it did not belong and scaring people into not using hospitals. This documentary is meant to be a launching pad to get people thinking. Choices cannot be made based solely on the views and facts presented in this film nor should choices be made without this view, I believe. If, in the back of your mind you wonder if the cesarean section rate is really 30%+ and climbing or if cesarean sections are really as safe as vaginal births or if the US ranks at #41 for infant mortality, look it up! In the end, peoples opinions will just be their opinions and viewing this documentary will be a waste of your time if we do not research for ourselves and come to our own conclusion that we feel confident with. I recommend other resources like The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth, A Good Birth, A Safe Birth and The Heart and Science of Home Birth (Check my ""favorite resources"" tab for more!) for more information on obstetrical interventions, birth settings and maternity care providers. It is so important to have a well rounded education based on unbiased facts before making a decision.

3351490,5,B0013LL2XY,"This shines a light on the history of birthing in the U.S.  It's NOT what you might think.  There were some VERY dark times in the history of ""medicalized"" birth, once the hospitals took over what was normally a natural process.  It's a good thing that hospitals are around today because some pregnancies have complications, especially if the mother already has an illness of some kind.  Still, this scenario is the exception rather than the rule.  Most babies can be born at home, and they still are in other countries around the world.  In the U.S., birthing, as most everything else comes down to money.  That's how having babies moved into the hospital system.

This film covers that history but also follows several women through their decisions to have a home birth.  When you learn of the insane catch-22 spiral that hospitals create with alternating epidural/pitocin treatments that ultimately end in a C-section, you'll get infuriated.  At other times, you'll cry with joy at the beauty of the birthing segments.  This film is quite an education and is highly recommended.",1346457600,5,1081,4.95

3351547,4,B0013LL2XY,"I guess if I was able to get pregnant, or had a friend who was, I'd give this five stars. It's all about natural birth, specifically home birth, midwives and the comparison to hospital births.

Some shocking statistics: the US has the lowest rate of midwife-assisted births of any country, and also the worst infant mortality rate of any developed country. It has been proved over and over again that normal vaginal birth is lots safer for both mother and baby, but the incidence of caesarian section is up to like one-third of all births.

Mothers (especially famous women) are having caesarians because it's convenient. You can schedule your birth around the shooting schedule for your next film. You can get a tummy tuck at the same time as the caesarian, so you get your figure back in a hurry. But there are a lot of dangerous chemicals used in hospitals to induce labor, then to cope with the consequences of that drug, then . . . but you get the idea.

Statistics suggest that some of these drugs may be linked to ADHD and related neurological disorders in kids. They also can screw up the mother/child bonding process.

Another ironic fact is that insurance companies are down on natural birth. This is especially weird when it costs so much less. Maybe it's just that they have OB/GYN advisers when they set their policies, and so there's a disincentive to help them see midwives -- no matter how well trained and qualified -- as valid health care providers.

The best part of the film is that we get to see several home births, and also a couple of hospital births. We get to know the parents and the babies, and the whole thing will have you scratching your head about why the US statistics on child birth are so screwed up.",1336694400,3,1735,4.565916398713826

Historical, factual information proves we have been told time and again by organizations such as the FDA, that particular foods, drugs, and chemicals are safe, when in fact they were not.

I watched it for the first time after having my daughter in a local hospital. Although I was able to deliver her naturally with the help of a doula and an awesome nurse I lucked into getting when I was admitted, I still faced the uphill battle of ensuring the natural outcome I so wanted for both me and my daughter because of all the medical interventions readily available at the hospital. This is a homebirth heavy documentary, but because it follows a midwife who only delivers in homes, I don't know how they could have gotten away from that aspect. Nevertheless, I have found it to be a good tool that can be used in conjunction with other tools, e.g. birth classes, doulas, books, etc., to help women make truly informed decisions about their birth experience--no matter what that decision is.

3351624,5,B0013LL2XY,"The title of this DVD nailed it. Giving birth in the US is a money making business. I had an EXCELLENT pregnancy (my first one) at age 33. I was full of energy, worked out until the last day I gave birth, etc. I had a ""good"" OB/GYN whom I went to during my 9 months. Of course the day I went into labor (I was 10 days over my due date) he was out of town (he wanted to induce me, but I said NO! I had a gut feeling I was gonna go into labor naturally and I did). The back-up doctor (monster) we had was a MORON!!!! To make a long story short, everything that was shown in this DVD, we went thru. The minute we got to the hospital the MORON was pressuring me to get the epidural. I was afraid since it's a scary procedure and there is always that 1% chance a patient ends up paralyzed. I held out as long as I could and endured the pain until I couldn't take it anymore, so I got the epidural. I was pretty much left in the labor room alone (i.e. only my hubby and my mom) but the MORON of the doctor barely even came in. I felt like I was pinned to the bed, and a slave to the doctor's and nurses orders. I imagined my labor to be as smooth as my pregnancy was. Not even close! Mind ya, I was FULLY dilated, my water broke on its own at the hospital, yet the nurses took their precious time to fuss around. Like they purposely did not inform me what was going on so that they can prolong the labor and perform a C-section on me. My mom, who was in the room with us and gave birth twice in her life without any epidural, she knew what was going on. She even got pissed off when she saw my monitor and the contractions were literally a minute apart and I was left in the room without any help. When the MORON doctor FINALLY decided to show up after I was in labor for close to 10 hours now, all he did was flip me around in all sorts of positions, not even giving me a chance to push (although giving birth with an epidural you can't feel any contractions), but that's when the doctor is supposed to HELP the patient in letting me know when to push. Duh! He just stood there and then leaned over to me and whispered into my ear ""I am sorry but we have to do a C-section"". I WAS BEYOND PISSED!!!!! The hospital also IGNORED my birthing plan, I asked NOT to have anyone else in the room besides my hubby and my mom, which was ignored. Over 20 med students came in gawking over me while I was in distress. Needless to say I was wheeled out into the OR, crying, screaming and BEGGING the nurses and the doctor NOT to do this. At this point I was so pissed off, that I didn't even care about the pain anymore, and I was determined to show this doctor he will NOT make money off of me! Sure enough at this point on, I was NOT gonna be treated like another $$$ sign and didn't even give a damn who was telling me what to do. With the little sensation I had below my waist from the epidural, when I felt a contraction coming on (oh and mind ya, I was already being prepped for a C-section), but I turned on my side and I pushed so hard that sure enough I gave birth NATURALLY. You should have seen the look on the MORON's face that he didn't end up doing his C-section on me.

That night, there were 4 other women who gave birth (I was the fifth one), and they ALL had C-sections. Now you tell me, do you honestly believe that all 4 of those women had complications??? I think not!

The title of this DVD can't be any more right!!!! Giving birth in America IS a business. The reason C-sections are on the rise because it's more money in the doctors pocket, less time they have to waste with each patient and less of a chance for a lawsuit if the woman gives birth naturally. Period.

Of course the doctors will come up with some lame excuse that the baby is in ""danger"" and what woman would not wanna believe it. My baby was NOT breech, her head was clearly crowning, yet the doctor wanted a C-section. Are you kidding me???

I have very low tolerance for pain, that is why I know I could not give birth at home, but one thing for sure, before my nightmare of a labor, my husband and I planned on having two kids. But now, we don't ever wanna go thru this horrible ordeal again! The doctor literally robbed us of what was supposed to be a wonderful experience.

I think this DVD is a MUST see for every woman who plans on getting pregnant and giving birth. And any woman who thinks will have this fairytale labor, yeah, think again! The minute you walk into a hospital, no breathing techniques, Pilates ball nonsense, candle lights, will get you thru when there is a doctor with $$$ on his mind.

Natural births in this country will be a thing of the past!

I'm sure there have been plenty of wonderful births both in the hospital and at home.. but what experience am I truly interested in? This is the question that I walked away with. I do not think I want a homebirth for my first, so I started researching the hosptials in the Baltimore, MD area which offered more of a 'birthing center' atmosphere. I found only one (Mercy) that has listed on the website multiple delivery options, such as the ability to walk around, eat during labor, and have the choice of a water birth. This surprised me. So, for me, this film was a springboard which made me realize that I have a lot more research to do. It wasn't telling me what to do.",1323820800,,1000,4.561111111111111

3351672,2,B0013LL2XY,"I knew this film would be one-sided, but I was very interested in seeing the particular side that was portrayed since I had a medicated hospital birth with my first and I'm currently pregnant with my second. However, I could not believe how angry I got at some of the conclusions that were drawn about women who give birth in a hospital. The worst part was when one man inferred that women who are medicated during birth or have c-sections don't have the proper hormones to love their children. Are you kidding me? Also it was inferred that women who have hospital births don't experience the joy and beauty of birth. I personally had a wonderful experience in a hospital. I know that there are horror stories that come from hospital births, but this film makes it seem as though they are all that way. I experienced quite a bit of pain before my epi so it's not like I missed out on that. I also felt no pressure from any of the staff or doctors to do anything I didn't want to do. And then the moment my sweet child was put on my chest, I couldn't do anything but thank the Lord and cry tears of joy. How on earth could this have been any sweeter? Just because I wasn't in a tub in my living room? I had my precious son! Anyway, I am all for natural birth, home birth, unmedicated birth, etc if that's what you want. But I don't think that women who have the same mountaintop experiences in hospitals have missed out on one ounce of joy. And why didn't the filmmakers talk about unmedicated births in a hospital? This is happening quite a bit these days. Are those women still totally disillusioned because they went to the hospital (gasp!)?

3351675,4,B0013LL2XY,"I found The Business of Being Born to be very informative and definitely worth watching, I highly recommend it. I have only a couple complaints:

1. A bit of nudity towards the end, my husband and I would've appreciated more modesty. I've had one hospital birth, two home-births, with a third at the end of this year. I can therefore say with some measure of authority that it's not necessary to walk around topless or nude. Yes, birth is perfectly natural. So is sex, urination, and defecation. I'm not going to do any of those on screen.

2. I like home-birth because it feels so right, I have no other way to explain it. I'm a major advocate for home-birth, but what I can't stand is the ""movement"" associated with it. I do the home-birth because it's better for the child being born, the rest of the family, as well as myself (barring an emergency comes up, obviously). It's about mommy and baby, not ""empowerment"" and ""I am woman, hear me roar"". It's irritating and, in my opinion, it degrades women who choose to home-birth.",1322697600,,1030,4.562162162162162

A friend suggested it to me and I have since told her that it was a little crazy for me to even consider!!!!!  Not much ""education/information"" in this video...basically just follows around a few women who give birth at home.

However, after seeing the entire movie, I am happy I did.  It is certainly worth a view.  The video shows several home-births.  That in and of itself was informative.  It also spurred on more research for the Pitocin use for non-induced patients.  That was rather alarming to me.  It also allowed me to vocalize some concerns that I have and had about inductions.  The film does not go into additional options for child birth rather than the home-birth and medical hospital birth.  It would have been nice to learn about options for those that can not have a home birth.  I am in that category and as a result of this film and further research, I have decided to hire a doula.",1321401600,,821,4.523809523809524
3351679,5,B0013LL2XY,"I love this film.  Is it biased?  Of course.  It was made as a response to Ricki Lake's birth experiences, in the hospital and at home.  It is about stories.  Not to mention it's a rare view into alternative birthing options.  I saw this for the first time when I was training to be a doula.  It inspired me to get more information and what I found was shocking.  I never realized how the medicalization of birth was so closely tied to the eugenics movement.  And how granny midwives in the south were eliminated by medicare and the cultural association of home birth=poverty.  So to be fair, the film could have been much more biased.

I also thought it was poignant that Epstein had an emergency c-section.  I felt it really shows that obstetric interventions can truly be life saving when used with discretion.  While medical advancement has caused numerous setbacks, it also truly a blessing.  In addition, Epstein never fully seemed sold on the idea of a home birth.  Her conversations with the midwife talk about potential transfer to a birthing center.  Every woman is different and every birth will be different.  And women should be given education, resources, and options to find what works best for them.

I encourage women to not use a 90 minute documentary to decide your birth plan; however, this is an excellent place to get a ""most births don't require a hospital"" view and an excellent place to start further research.  I have truly enjoyed the educational journey that this documentary inspired, and I hope that it is the beginning of empowerment for a multitude of women regardless of where or how you give birth.",1320969600,3,1632,4.723404255319149

3351731,1,B0013LL2XY,"In my opinion the creators of this DVD are either grossly misinformed or pushing an agenda. I was absolutely repulsed by the amount of bashing of the US Medical System in this DVD.

The final straw for me was when the creators repeated an often used and misleading ""statistic"" regarding infant mortality rates in the United States compared to other countries around the world. The same type of propaganda that we saw coming out during the ramming through of Obamacare. All done to make the best healthcare system in the world look like a failed third world system based solely on profit without any regard for the patient.

Every country has their own rating system regarding infant mortality and it is impossible to compare these ratings between different countries because they simply are not the same.

As an example: Most of the European Union does not include babies born before 26 weeks as ""live births"" into their statistics. Switzerland does not include any baby born under 30cm in length as a ""live birth"" and Germany and Canada do not include any babies born under one pound as a ""live birth"".

Many of the industrialized nations which boast some of the lowest infant mortality rates like France, Hong Kong and Japan do not include babies that die within the first 24 hours of birth as ""live births"" (Half of reported US infant deaths occur within the first 24 hours). All of these ""exceptions"" help to suppress the infant mortality rates of other countries substantially.

In comparison, the United States has a much more encompassing set of standards for the category of ""live birth"". The United States includes ALL babies born with ANY signs of life irrespective of weight or size into the category of ""live births"".

3351735,5,B0013LL2XY,"I happened upon this documentary in the midst of wrestling with my decsision for healthcare when I have a baby.  I am only in the preconception stage, but I think it's very important to do research and know the options.  For many reasons I lean towards a traditional hospital birth, probably because it's the norm here in the U.S.  However, I really see nothing wrong with the homebirth as long a knowledgeable, experienced midwife is present.  For me though, I don't think I would choose a homebirth, but I do want natural, no drugs, no doctor pushiness, and the least amount or artificial intervention.  I would prefer a Certified Nurse Midwife at a hospital location.  Whatever your choice, I think this film does an excellent job of illustrating why maternity care has become a scary and unnatural experience instead of a natural, loving one.
To address some of the negative reviews, this film does not ""demonize"" women that choose not to have a home birth. That kind of thinking is produced solely from a closed minded, ignorant perspective, as is the validity of whether or not it's Rikki Lake or some other journalist producing this film.  I appreciated it for the knowledge it gave me that I couldn't gain from just a book or watching ""A Baby Story"" on TLC.  Ever notice how many C-sections and epidurals they dole out on that show?  When in such a vulnerable position, it's easy to see how woman are persuaded by ""the expert"" at a hospital to hurry the process through artificial means.  I believe armed with the facts well before that time, women will be in a better position to make the right choices for themselves and their child.  If you value learning and seeing the different situations from homebirth to an unplanned C-secition in a hospital, watch this film!

This is a completely one sided documentary. It presents a lot of opinions as though they are facts, and seems to try to demonize women for making the choice to have a ""traditional"" hospital birth.

That being said I do think women should be educated about the processes and facts of giving birth, which this film sort of does. In a totally biased, opinion-based, limited facts way. It confirmed my beliefs of disagreeing with home births 100%. The goal should be to have women make an educated choice that's right for them, not a baised choice that's what Ricki Lake wants, as this documentary would have women do.",1313020800,3,761,4.8538461538461535

I think there are more informative books out there, but sadly, I know many people do not like to read, particularly men whose wives are expecting.

I work with expecting moms and I honestly was completely unaware of how child birth is seen and practiced in the American medical field. I really thought that hospitals provided expecting mothers complete education on the process of child birth. I was beyond shocked to learn that child birth is mainly driven by profit and convenience. The medical field had me fooled into thinking that natural child birth can be dangerous if not done in a hospital. Wow, knowledge is truly power and now I am definitely sharing this documentary with the expecting moms I work with, so they many have the knowledge, choice and power to make their OWN decisions about how they would like to bring their child into this world.

3351791,5,B0013LL2XY,"When I first heard of home birthing, the idea appealed to me.  Being on my own turf and delivering at my own pace seemed like the most natural way to give birth.  However, the idea scared me, too.  What if something went wrong?  If home birthing really safe?

What this documentary shows, in great detail, is that it's actually safer than a hospital birth. In hospitals, pregnancy is treated like an illness that the doctor ""saves"" a woman from. The reality, however, is that it's the doctor's interference that creates the illness.  There's a great cartoon illustrating how much overkill these procedures are.

Hospitals are a business designed to get patients in and out as quickly as possible.  This results in baby's being delivered on the hospital's schedule, not the baby's.  Midwives, in contrast, deliver on the baby's schedule.  For that, they're considered a threat to this business, resulting in smear campaigns (from the 1900s to now) designed to frighten women away from them, which you're shown.

This documentary offers an alternative to the standard way of giving birth, which Ricki Lake demonstrates in a filming of her second child's birth.  Her first birth was a hospital birth, which she felt robbed her of a meaningful experience because she felt pressured to perform.  With her second birth, she deviates from the ""normal"" position of women lying on their backs (which exacerbates their pain) and being drugged throughout.  The result was so beautiful, it moved me to tears.

I should note that this documentary doesn't discount a doctor's role in dangerous childbirths.  Instead, it shows that childbirth needn't be considered a scary illness.  Women's bodies are actually a lot smarter than given credit.  This message is important because it allows women to reclaim power over their bodies.",1310860800,2,1815,5.074324324324325

3351793,4,B0013LL2XY,"I thought my endless google searches had educated me almost as much as I was going to get on the subject!  But this DVD added to my knowledge!  I  left this documentary no longer wanting to enter the field of labor and delivery after graduating nursing school.  I've gained disappointment towards the field to an extent.  The part that affected me most, and hit close to home was the part on pitocin. I've always thought, ""I'd love to do home delivery, but what if something scary were to happen like before?!""  See, with each of my two daughters, there was a point when the nurses & respitory techs rushed in to give me oxygen, saying that the baby's heart rate was dropping.  Very scary for me.  Luckily the baby was OK & I delivered with out needing a c section or anything, but I wondered ""what if that happened again when delivering naturally?!  This DVD taught me how those scary encounters most likely wouldn't have happened if i delivered naturally.  I was taught by this DVD that pitocin is given to induce labor/contractions (which I knew).  Which caused unnatural and much stronger/longer/closer together contractions.  OK, fine.  But since they're all of the previously described, they're much more painful!  Often resulting in the desire for an epidural earlier.  So the woman gets her pain relief (epidural), yet it slows down labor's progress.  So the medical team provides more pitocin.  This of course brings on and intensifies more of those unnatural stronger/longer/closer together contractions.  So what does this do to the baby meanwhile?  Basically squeeze the **** out of it, causing a lower heart rate & less attainable oxygen. Sometimes it leads to, ""the baby's heartrate is dropping too much--we need to do an emergency c section!"".  Then after they say, ""Thank goodness we were able to perform that c-section so quickly to save your baby!"".  This is all of what happened to me (minus the c section fortunately), each time with my deliveries.  And I had no idea what was being done to me until I viewed this powerful DVD. You guys won't believe the other stuff you learn about labor & delivery, and it's history.  It's depressing.  A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  EMPOWER AND EDUCATE YOURSELF!!!!

3351796,5,B0013LL2XY,"This is an absolutely amazing film and honestly changed my life. I originally passively flipped this film on because it was about babies and I was just in the mood to watch something about babies! I had no idea what it was about and watched it on some random website that didn't even have a description of the movie on it. I am SO happy I did. I have always been one of those people who have been absolutely petrified of pain and fantasized about getting an epidural the moment the first contraction started- or, even better, marching up to the Labor & Delivery counter and refusing labor. ""GIMMIE A C-SECTION!"" I didn't want to feel anything. I was terrified. I was even so afraid of needles I had to be sedated in the past. Not anymore. This documentary changed ALL of that for me. It completely opened my eyes to a whole new way of doing things and I have gotten my hands on everything I can about natural childbirth ever since. I absolutely loved this film. It is wonderfully done, and I love that it recognizes that there is a time and a place for medical intervention, but that every birth does not require the level of intervention that has become standard in the United States and yet no where else in the world- and somehow we have the highest maternal and newborn death rate. There is something very wrong with that. I very much look forward to my birthing experience now whenever it will happen now, and also highly recommend the book ""Baby Catcher"" by Peggy Vincent. Also, look into HynoBabies as a childbirth preparation technique. It's an all inclusive class, course and can be done at home as well on an ipod and is highly effective. (Do note it is Hypno BABIES, not hypnobirth, which is different). Loved this film- changed my life! Really!",1307664000,2,1756,4.5251572327044025
3351797,2,B0013LL2XY,"I honestly I feel really offended but this documentary. They make people like me look stupid and uneducated because we chose to give birth in a hospital!.
I had my son in a hospital and I had an epidural and let me tell you... I wouldn't WANT to do it any other way.  I was relaxed, focused and it only took a few pushes and he was out. I am not saying that home birth is wrong, I mean, if you think is safe, by all means do it, but don't criticize the way I have my children.
When someone tells me that I am not capable to love my child the same as a woman who had a home birth because I was given a ""cocktail of drugs"" is simply ridiculous! How dare someone tell me that I am not a woman and that someone that had their baby without drugs is going to love their child more than me! He even compared women that have C-sections to a monkey and what would a monkey do in that situation!
I don't agree with schedule C-sections and I do agree that doctors can push either medications or procedures upon you just so they can charge more to the insurance companies, but I've seen this with pediatricians and my son's regular check-ups than when I had him.  Also, this is YOUR CHOICE, if you are Victoria Beckham and want to have 4 schedule C-sections... go right ahead, but don't do a documentary on how much better mother and human being you are because you did so.
I think this documentary while entertaining and with very heartfelt home moments and personal experiences lacks the ""other side"" factor. They are just pushing home birth as the best and SAFEST way to go, that hospital births are for those who want to be ""used"" by the system and that don't care about their children or their pregnancies, which certainly that's not the case with everyone and with every doctor.
I am mad, I was mad while watching this documentary and I am mad as I type this... I know I might be a few years late (this came out in 2007) but still! I am not less of a woman because I went to a hospital and had an epidural... so stop making it seem like I am!",1306800000,5,2036,4.16497461928934

But, if you are looking for straight, unbiased information outlining the pros and cons of home birth, this is not it.  The statistics are quoted out of context and there is very little explanation given of the possible dangers of home birth. Hospital births are described in a way that is completely foreign to anything I've ever seen.  The movie makers have taken the worst examples of unnecessary medical intervention and portrayed it as if it were commonplace.

They say that 90% of births can safely occur outside a hospital.  Perhaps.  But, what about the 10% that run into trouble?  How well do those mothers and infants fare after a rushed transport to the nearest emergency room?  Would you allow your child to participate in an event that had a 1 in 10 chance of death or disability?

3351853,4,B0013LL2XY,"I first watched this movie midway through my pregnancy, when I was ready to stop being scared, start getting educated, and explore what birth was really going to be like. My first impression was that it was extremely biased, with the goal of promoting home birth over hospital birth, and some of the comments from the natural birth advocates made me roll my eyes.

But I must say, even with my skepticism, the part about the cascade of interventions grabbed my attention and I couldn't shake it from my mind. The last thing I wanted was a C-section...I was already considering natural childbirth because I hate needles, so I was more afraid of an epidural than the pain of childbirth. Watching this movie really made me think and want to research the benefits versus risks of such common interventions. Up to that point, I only had one friend who had had a natural, unmedicated (hospital) birth, and didn't know anyone who had had a home birth. The majority of women I knew with kids spent more time shopping at Babies R Us than reading about birth or independently preparing for their births. Most of them read ""What to Expect When You're Expecting,"" maybe took a brief hospital childbirth class, went to the hospital as soon as their water broke, or got induced for whatever (non-medically indicated) reason, including ""I'm tired of being pregnant,"" got an epidural, and ""trusted their doctor"" and the hospital staff to take care of them. Did they have any idea what the risks were? Did they question anything? Were they treated badly and not even realize it, just accepted it as a part of the horror of childbirth that American culture perpetuates? Did they view birth as a medical event, an emergency waiting to happen, that needed to be actively managed?

Watching this movie brought out all of those questions in me, and made me seek out others who had experience with the more natural, non-medical side of birth, and I'm SO glad. My husband and I found an independent, natural-focused childbirth class, got a doula, and were well-prepared for our hospital birth. I continued my pregnancy with a completely different, positive outlook on birth, had no fear, and looked forward to it as what my body was made to do, a transformative experience! I was able to avoid almost all unwanted interventions...but the hospital still had their protocols, and I still had to submit to their control, which I didn't like. So while we weren't comfortable with home birth at that time, I will definitely be planning for one next time! It didn't register during my first viewing of the movie, but it did when I watched it again after my daughter was born--how calm and peaceful the home births were, how different the environment was,  the pain relief and relaxation provided by the water births, for example (good luck finding that at the hospital). When I compare the idea of that, with how I felt in the hospital, strapped to the fetal monitor, with 4 different nurses and an impatient doctor telling me how to push (on my back), I would definitely rather be at home in the tub.

I still admit the movie is biased, but I recommend it to all of my pregnant friends, just as a starting point, hoping that it will get them questioning things like it did for me, not so that they'll choose natural or home birth. I support all EDUCATED birth choices--it's when a woman is misled into something, by a care provider that she has blind trust in, and then disappointed with her birth outcome, where if she'd had all relevant information and been able to offer informed consent, things may have been different, that I have a problem with.",1302220800,17,3622,4.708201892744479

3351856,1,B0013LL2XY,"I'm a mother of two, and I found this movie to be extremely offensive if not downright dangerous. It uses lies, cheap scare tactics, and guilt trips to get its point across.

How to give birth is a deeply personal choice. What works for one woman may not work for another. Both my children were born in a hospital, and every decision I made regarding their coming into this world had months of research behind it. What I wanted above all was a healthy baby, and I got it, twice. I was not forced to lie on my back, or to take pitocin, or to have my perineum sliced, or anything of the sort... What I did, twice, was give birth in a safe, clean environment, with my loved ones and competent medical staff who stuck by me and cared about me and my babies. On the other hand, my mother, who had a normal pregnancy and a ""natural"" labor, ended up with severe postpartum hemorrhage that, had she been at home and not a hospital, would've killed her.

To insist your body was ""designed"" to give birth and blatantly disregard statistics and facts that show anything can happen and no one is guaranteed their labor will go smoothly, is arrogance and irresponsibility of the worst kind, because it involves juggling the life of another human being. To have some ""expert"" who's never given birth (and never will, due to being a man) sit there and philosophize about how a woman who's had a C-section or pitocin, QUOTE/UNQUOTE, ""doesn't care about the child because she doesn't receive that cocktail of love hormones released into the body during normal birth"", is beyond offensive (he even goes as far as to imply that hospital births are the reason our society is failing. Really? Boy, they sure had a great big utopia 300 years ago!) To suggest that a woman who chooses a hospital birth is ignorant, and to imply that she's less caring and loving toward her child is uncalled for. Yes, some may be uneducated, but in this day and age, most women diligently do their homework, and guess what... Many still choose to go to the hospital. Not everyone wants a hypothetical medal to go with their birth. Every woman who gives birth still goes through 9 months of pregnancy, feels her baby kick, hears the heartbeat, and cries tears of happiness when she first sees the little one on that ultrasound screen. Every woman who gives birth wants, above all, a healthy baby. Every woman wants to remember hearing her baby cry for the first time and holding her for the first time, not the dandy little fact that she gave birth in a bathtub because she is woman, hear her roar. There's something seriously wrong with people who think birthing your baby in a tub somehow makes you a better mom.

Who are you, Ricki Lake, to decide what is best for others? Who are you to tell women that having painkillers somehow makes it all less special, or makes them worse mothers? They demonize doctors, belittle women who choose hospitals, and state that homebirth is THE safest, best way to give birth, and yet in the end of the movie something goes wrong with the director's very own labor and she has to go to that evil hospital, where those evil doctors end up saving her baby's life... Seriously? What arrogance and total lack of integrity!

They never actually site statistics and facts. They don't tell you that today, a hospital setting doesn't equal being tied down and being medicated and cut against your will. They don't tell you that many hospitals today offer laboring women the opportunity to walk, be in any position they choose, be in the tub or shower, use doulas, and basically do whatever they want, unless there is an emergency. They glorify Europe's ""wonderful"" system but don't tell you that its high percentage of midwife births is due to COSTS, not CHOICE. They don't tell you that homebirth statistics are skewed because every time a homebirth requires an emergency procedure and the woman is sent to the hospital, it's not counted as homebirth but as a hospital birth. They don't give you statistics on what happens if something does go wrong with a homebirth. They don't mention that MANA (Midwives Alliance of North America) refuses to release its safety data to the public (I wonder why...). They don't tell you about all the babies and mothers who were hurt or died during homebirth.

Every responsible, caring woman wants what's best for her child. Shame on Ricky Lake & Co for making this biased, skewed, extremist rubbish. For the love of God, people, don't be swayed by it.

3351857,5,B0013LL2XY,"My husband and I have been discussing since we got married the prospect of having biological children, as well as adopting. We have a 13 year old son from one of his previous relationships who was born via ""emergency"" C-Section. After over 12 hours of labor and 2 hours of pushing, the doctors determined that her hips were ""too narrow"" to push the baby through and rushed her to the OR for a C-Section that she did not want.

 After that experience my husband has been a fierce advocate for natural birth, and I was all FOR the hospital and the epidural.

 Then we watched our nephew being born in April of last year. My sister in law chose to have an induction and ended up with so much epidural in her system that 3 hours after her son's birth, she still needed assistance moving the lower half of her body because it was still numb.

 I started reading the book Your Best Birth by the makers of this film and the movie was mentioned. I tried to rent in here on Amazon but for some reason was unable to, but I found it on netflix and watched it last night.

 I must admit that as someone who is in her late 20's, and has yet to experience birth personally, I now know after watching this movie that I will be having a home birth with a midwife and probably a water birth at that. My husband has been joking for weeks (we will be starting to try for a child in about a year to 2 years) that our baby will not be born in a hospital after the experience he and his son's mother experienced in 1998. After seeing this movie - I believe that I will NOT be giving birth to my child in a hospital with medical intervention unless completely necessary!

It was educational and discussed the importance of natural births. Yet, I thought that perhaps it was a bit too one-sided and may be exaggerating a bit.

The next week I went in to discuss my birth plan with my doctor and I experienced static and resistance when I mentioned the words ""birth plan"", ""natural"", and the possibility of a ""water-birth"". I then started realizing that this documentary was very true. I even went to the hospital's midwives department to discuss the possibility of transferring to their care and they got nervous as it's unusual for a patient to transfer from a doctor to a midwife halfway through pregnancy. Therefore, the documentary did adequately warn about the resistance a mother will encounter if she tries to go a different route rather than through the hospital.

It also suggests that hospitals are profit driven, and often perform excessive procedures to increase their profits. Basically, this video does not describe birth, it describes the business side of birth. Good if you're undecided between hospital and home birth, but not good if you, like me, were looking for a scientific documentary instead.

I come from a developing country, but I have friends from all over. I've been living in the US for a year, and I still can't believe how this technological, modern society, has transformed women's mentality. It's not my intention to offend anybody, but from my experience, the American woman (not all, of course) is the less intuitive person I've ever seen in my life. Things that have always been normal in most parts of the world (even in developed European countries)like giving vaginal births without medical intervention/pain medication, or breastfeeding, are all an issue here.

3351899,5,B0013LL2XY,"This documentary has been reviewed extensively so I will just throw in my 2 cents worth. It is no secret that our profit-driven medical field in the United States is becoming less and less healthy for all of us. Insurance companies and hospital boards have money on the forefront of their mind, not the well being of patients (although many individual medical professionals really are interested in patient well-being). This is a society that wants to throw drugs at everything, or cut people open for everything, or both. This film shows that birthing is no exception.

Human history goes back for thousands of years, and yet it has only been since the 1940's that the majority of births have happened in hospitals. On the outside, this sounds like progress but it has gotten to the point where women are being given the message that they don't know how to give birth. Many medical processes are wonderful in extreme cases where serious injury or death would result, but often times we are seeing insurance companies and profit-driven decisions to drug and cut. Take a look at this documentary, it is really eye-opening.",1286841600,2,1121,4.869109947643979

3351941,5,B0013LL2XY,"I just recently watched ""The Business of Being Born"" for the first time, and found that it was a well-made, informative and timely film.  The information portrayed in the movie definitely goes against mainstream obstetrical practice, but I personally feel (as do many others) that it is important to rethink the medical stance taken on birth, and not be afraid to go against the mainstream ""tradition"".  I am pregnant right now, and I have already researched natural birth extensively, as well as am related to or am friends with several women who have had one or multiple joyous, healthy homebirths.  So this film did nothing to change my opinion on natural birth, only solidify it.

Even though I gave this five stars for a job well done, I still think a little bit more could have been said about ""in between"" options.  Like a natural, midwife-attended hospital birth or birth centers.  There was a little too much drama focused on the stars as well, which could have possibly been focused more on facts about homebirths, etc... at the same time, this wasn't an ordinary documentary and the dramas of personal birth do add a lot to the film.  In some cases, they brought me to tears.  The film really captured the joy of a healthy and fulfilling birth experience, and of the power of a woman's body to bear and birth her baby.

One reviewer mentioned that the ending was anticlimactic, with the star (*SPOILER*) having a c-section simply because the baby was breech. I disagree.  Having a doctor-attended c-section was necessary for her, because her baby was many weeks premature and suffering from IUGR, a very dangerous condition.  A basic full-term breech birth which was otherwise uncomplicated could possibly have been attended to at home, but not one so premature.  So there is a time and place for doctors, as well, which is proven on the film.  They simply may not be as necessary to a normal, healthy, uncomplicated pregnancy and birth.  In fact, they may be detrimental, as the film shows.

The only other comments I have are that a few of the natural birth scenes were a bit graphic for younger viewers, and there was some foul language used in the film, which I think would have been better to have been ""bleeped"" out.  Other than that, I highly recommend this film to any women who is pregnant or planning on having children in the future.  It is truly a mind-altering experience!",1285027200,3,2396,4.734939759036145
3351942,4,B0013LL2XY,"The film does a good job explaining how birth has become a medicalized event, and our culture is so brainwashed into thinking it is some sort of emergency that doctors have to save us from. It doesn't even occur to most people that you could have a homebirth. It explains how interventions can lead to more complications and a higher c-section rate, and the fact that doctors are pushing for c-sections now for convenience and monetary reasons, or to rush the birth. In short, the medical industry has stolen birth from women.

I think a lot of women don't realize that hospital birth has changed drastically in the past few decades. From speaking to my mother and other women around that age, giving birth 20 years ago, women didn't really even think about epidurals and just had their babies. Nowadays, most women expect to get an epidural, and hospitals now routinely give women pitocin when there is no medical reason to do so. Just knowing that in a hospital setting they really don't follow a woman's natural birthing mechanism but instead try to control it themselves is enough to turn me off to the idea of giving birth in a hospital. I have not had any children but when the time comes I will look at my options carefully.

Midwives are presented as a better option for women having normal births, since women in most other countries use midwives and have better outcomes. OB/GYN's are presented as what they truly are- a doctor that is trained to help women that are having complications and perform surgery in an emergency.

The only thing I was disappointed about in the film was the ending. Abby planned on having a homebirth, but went into labor prematurely, and the baby was breech. I understand the need for her to have the baby in the hospital because of this, but what I don't understand is why they immediately do a c-section. The baby being premature and the baby being breech are both not necessarily reasons to have a c-section. The film is almost protraying that which they were just speaking out against- the fact that doctors push c-sections nowadays for almost anything. The whole thing seemed kind of fishy, like they wanted the c-section to happen in the end so they could say ""See, we believe c-sections are good when necessary!"" because they needed something to show everyone that hospitals are ok in some cases.",1283472000,2,2342,4.7073170731707314

3351949,5,B0013LL2XY,"Having birthed in and out of the hospital, I couldn't believe how right on target this film was. It put into words all of the thoughts I had pondered since my first pregnancy. Women in our country have been duped for decades, and as a result, our country now has the dubious honor of sporting increasingly high C-section rates and notoriously high maternal and infant mortality rates. I told my daughter, who was born without the benefit of the hospital setting 20 years ago, that if she really wanted to fully understand my birthing choice, this documentary would certainly do the trick.",1279238400,2,588,4.7745098039215685

I consider it a ""must see"" for expecting parents, but also for anyone interested in birth, health care, midwifery, history, etc. It is very important that mothers are made aware that they have choices when it comes to birth, and that there are options other than that of a hospital birth. If at the end of this DVD, and perhaps after other research and homework, mothers make the decision to have a hospital birth/natural birth/home birth/ she will have done so knowing one, what she is getting herself into, and two, that she has choices. This film is at times horrifying and at times beautifully touching. I don't think it was the intention of the filmmakers to scare the viewers as much as it was to present the facts of birth in the US simply as they ARE.

3351972,5,B0013LL2XY,"First, I'll admit I do agree with some of the criticism of the movie. I knew little about Ricky Lake before this film (except a vague awareness of her daytime TV show), and I agree there were MANY side issues & follow-up questions they could have tackled.

Having said that, for a 90 minute documentary on the subject, they crammed a LOT of information here.... AND it was fun, funny, scary, sad, etc. It was a bit of a history lesson, a bit of modern medicine, and it was entertaining. And, it was certainly NOT a dry documentary.

What else can you ask for in a movie? Even though there were other issues I wish it had raised, the film did an excellent job of asking questions, then encouraging parents to go seek out their OWN information, and work out a plan that works for YOU.

So I give it 5 full stars. This raises questions that every parent should be asking (are hospitals driven by profit vs concern for your child's health? do the epidural & other drugs do more harm than good? are vaginal births better for you & your child than C-Section?) ... the central question, of course, is simply: What is best for my child?

I'm continually shocked at how few people ask that question, which is (in my opinion) your primary role as parent - what is best for your child? Identify what the best practices are, and do your best to follow them. Your goal isn't ""perfection"" - but it's also NOT defending past decisions, or family history. So many people just mimic the parenting methods their parents used, not even realizing that, hey! - there may be some new research and better methods out there.

This usually means going against the mainstream, or seriously questioning your doctor. And I'm continually shocked at how few people are willing to do this. It may mean being persistent at the hospital in turning down drugs, drips, and pain killers (did you know that the placenta does NOT filter the drugs - your child gets 100% of the dose!). It this might mean looking into the overwhelming new research that says most of those traditional childhood vaccines do more harm than good.

And asking the tough questions might mean (as it did for us) that your past decisions were made on bad information ... and now it's time for BETTER decisions for your children based on NEW / BETTER information. Please don't let your ego get in the way of making better decisions for your baby. (Remember the Milgram Experiment - people were willing to hurt others & themselves just because a guy in a white lab coat told them to!)

3351973,1,B0013LL2XY,"I purchased and watched this movie after reading the book written by the creators of the film (Your Best Birth). The book was much fairer by far. This movie was very one-sided and used scare tactics such as ""OBs are trained as surgeons"" and ""Birthing with interventions affects mother/baby attachment."" The ""experts"" often cite statistics that are from other countries such as The Netherlands but without really explaining the differences in the medical system.

The director of the movie ends up with a C-Section because her son comes early, and even then they don't say anything positive about the medical establishment. Her baby may have died otherwise. If birthing in a hospital, there are a lot of ways to overcome the establishment but it takes research on each individuals part--there is no one answer. It would have been nice to see more of that in the film.

The film bordered on propaganda with so many ""experts"" who had a larger interest in limiting what choices women could make for the sake of home birth, instead of opening up the range of ways women can take control in a range of experiences. There were parts of a comedy film interspersed which takes away from the seriousness of the film. The last woman who gives birth at home does it in front of cardboard boxes with a flashlight. This may not appeal to all women, but natural or unmedicated births may. It would be nice to see a follow-up film with women who don't support just one agenda.

I had to write a paper on infant mortality recently, and while doing my research I discovered that the US has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the developed world. I thought this documentary might shed some light on exactly why this is. This movie did that and more. I got some great research for my paper, but I also learned a great deal about the business of birthing in this country. When I have kids, I plan on having all-natural waterbirths. Before I watched this documentary, I'd never even heard of a waterbirth and I assumed *everyone* got doped up on painkillers and spinal tabs and had screaming, sweaty births. It really is sad how dependent our country has become on artificial drugs. Obviously there are many, many good things that come out of certain medicines and painkillers, but birth is *supposed* to hurt, you are squeezing a watermelon out of a quarter! Birth is a natural process that all mammals do, and have been doing since we evolved millions of years ago. Of course there are some cases in which medical intervention is necessary, and these cases are discussed in the documentary.

Some reviewers mentioned nudity. There is nudity, but I didn't feel grossed out or uncomfortable. And I'm 16.

Mostly it was the commentary by one of the people interviewed--she seemed ignorant and was stating a few things that simply weren't true (but were her opinion).  The other thing I found unacceptable was at the very end when the director went into pre-term labor and didn't even call her doctor.  I know she was at the cusp of when doctors would try stopping early labor (36/37 weeks), but even that early, babies can have problems breathing on their own or other issues.

All very textbook, according to today's medical procedures.

For my second child, I elected to go with a home birth, but, alas, legally the State of Pennsylvania does not ""allow"" a home birth following a Cesarean, even an unnecessary one.  I was lucky - and pushy enough - to get a midwife in the hospital delivery room.

3352038,5,B0013LL2XY,"I had been told my entire life (and of course, this is all you will ever see in the movies, too) that women have their babies in the hospital. This is how its done, right?

Wrong.

In every other country (except America) the MAJORITY of women use midwives and deliver their babies at home. America uses hospital births as the standard (over 85% of all births), yet we have the second highest infant mortality and mother mortality rates of any country in the WORLD! Maybe hospitals aren't the best option after all.

Ricki Lake has created a wonderful documentary about the ""business of being born."" She shows, using numerous interviews and proven facts, that hospital births are just that: a business. She talks about the history of midwives and shows women going through delivery with a midwife versus the women going through delivery at the hospital. She interviews nurses and doctors from the labor and delivery units of several hospitals asking them if they have ever seen anyone deliver a baby naturally (vaginally, no drugs or inducements). None of them had. Ricki Lake shows how the increased use of pitosin and other inducement drugs correlate with the rise in birth defects and child behavioral problems like Autism.

It is an incredibly eye-opening movie that all expecting couples should see before deciding the route of delivery that they want to take. Also great for people who have not yet started having children (it's never too early to think about it). It is definitely worth the small investment of money for the video to hear the whole truth (especially when you think about the fact that a midwife costs about $4000 for all pre and post-natal care and delivery, while just giving birth in a hospital can cost over $10,000). This video will help you make an informed decision.

The personal stories are wonderful (though I wish we had spent more time with the midwifery practice to personalize that story more), the information is fascinating, the births are amazing, and it's all packaged beautifully.  Again, the only complaint is that I would have liked -more- specifics on insurance company profiteering, policy trends that care more about protecting against liability than making sure the woman is really cared for, and things of that nature (the Business end of ""The Business of being born"").

3352068,5,B0013LL2XY,"Thank you Ricki Lake for using your power as a celebrity to produce a film which has changed the way we look at birth. Even more powerful then Ms Lakes celebrity status is her power as a consumers to change birth in America. Hospital administrators don't sit at board meetings asking the question ""how will our policies empower women in birth"". Theirs is simply the bottom line of gross earnings. If women do not stand up for the kind of care they want, it simply won't be there. This film educates and arms women with the truth about the routine care they are receiving. It awakens the American public to the myths of the ""safe hospital birth verses the dangerous homebirth"". This information has been out there for years, but this film attempts to bring it to mainstream. As a Certified Nurse Midwife who has practiced homebirth for over 30 years, this was the most exciting film created about birth, period. Now it is in our hands, the consumers.
In the 1970s women demanded that their husbands be present during childbirth and for a natural birth experience. They wrote letters to the hospitals, to the papers, to legislators, and to anyone willing or not willing to listen. They drove hours to go to hospitals that honored their demands showing local hospitals they would loose money if they didn't provide different care. Men handcuffed themselves to their wives and couples flew, in labor, to have a natural birth, showing administrators how far they would go to get what they wanted. By the early 1980s birth improved in many cities in America. There were more options, and depending upon the area you lived, hospitals were moving more towards a ""home like"" experience for families and the rise in out of hospital Birth Centers was significant and even the demand for homebirth crept up. What happened? Women stopped complaining and the epidural became fad. Technology became safety and fear replaced empowerment. Women quickly forgot they could give birth and the c-section rates skyrocketed. Hospitals soon found out that if they let families in, hung wallpaper, and placed a rocking chair in the room, they could cut corners and slowly but surly remove all of the power women had fought for. What we as women did not give away, malpractice and litigation placed the fatal blow to. This film shows the outcome of what was lost, what the truth is, and opens your eyes to what is possible.
We are in turbulent times in America and healthcare is in the forefront of these issues. I have seen the power of standing up for the right to give birth with real safety, dignity and empowerment. And I have seen how complacency has taken it all away. Watch this film, show it to everyone you can. Then go out there and form local consumer groups to take back your birth. Your baby doesn't get a ""do over"" and you deserve to have a safe birth and the kind of birth you desire. Thanks again Ricki Lake for planting this seed! Note: Not all women want or can have a homebirth, but midwifery care works with high risk as well as low risk births just as well. I did my internship at Santa Fe Indian Hospital in Santa Fe, NM. This was a midwifery run service with a collaborative practice of an OB/GYN and Midwives. We co-managed all high risk births, and if it was a vaginal delivery, the midwife did the delivery. This population had a very high rate of diabetes and pre-eclampsia, as well as social economic risk factors. With a Midwifery Model of Care and exceptional cooperation between our collaborative OB doctors, we had a 12% C-section rate. Something the World Health Organization state should be the percentage of C-section in the general population. High risk woman do not have to feel that midwifery care can not benefit them. Think of the possibilities if you had access to collaborative care ware your providers believed in your ability to give birth. All women should demand the right to have this type of care in all settings.",1252540800,2,3936,4.69753979739508

Doctors want to over medicalize the most natural and beautiful thing on earth.....it's so sad. Birth can be the most amazing and impowering thing a women can go through in her life, but thanks to modern day medicine, it's lost it's appeal.

3352072,3,B0013LL2XY,"Like all documentaries, this one is biased.  Overall, it explained a few things I was wondering about.  First of all, what are my options on alternative births?  What is the downfall of modern science?  What is best for me and my baby is something I need to decide myself, but this movie gave me information to help me make that decision.  I did not go into this movie thinking it would be unbiased.  What documentary is?  I did not like how the only doctors interviewed believed the system was faulty with the exception of one who they constantly proved wrong.  Ever doctor was also from NYC.  I am from a smaller Midwestern community and I think that the doctors in this area may have different opinions.  Maybe they would not have a birth plan system or maybe they would be more accommodating.  I only really know my doctor.  Which is another thing that was not explored at all.  My doctor is a family practice doctor.  He has provided care for me since I was 12.  Every doctor in the movie was only in the picture for prenatal care and delivery.
Also, I laughed at propaganda of the portrayal of the original hospital births.  Yeah they were bad!  But so was hospital care at that point!  They had barely moved away from blood letting!  What the medical profession was 100 years ago is a far cry from today.
I also have no option for alternative births.  The closest midwife (and then only one) is 80 miles away.  The next closest (Minneapolis) is a 5 hour drive.  This type of situation was never discussed.  I would have like to hear more about alternative birthing plans in the hospital.  There was only one view of the hospital birthing.  My thought is that the filmakers needed to do more research and spend more time on the movie.

What I liked:

I did find it very informative into many aspects of home birthing and midwifery.  I did not realize all the medications that were given during labor and all the interventions. I am happy I am now more aware they are not all necessary other than speeding it up for the doctor. This has made me more prepared for these decisions and has given me more time to do more research.  Most women I know would not give hospital birthing a second thought.  I guess part of that reason is there are few options, but I have never heard a single discussion about alternative births in any discussion on birth I have had with another female.

I am not necessarily saying I did not like the movie, only that it was biased.  I was appreciative of the information I did receive, although I wish it were more complete.  I think this movie brought alternative births out in the open and hopefully it will be something looked at more critically with future mothers.",1249344000,60,2701,4.480492813141684

3352087,2,B0013LL2XY,"I am definitely a fan of natural childbirth, midwifery, home births, etc. but this movie makes women like me (once again) feel inadequate.  I am unable to have such a birth (other than natural--unless, God-forbid, intervention is required) because I am a high-risk patient due to autoimmune disease.  My baby will need to be checked out immediately after birth of signs of neonatal lupus, heart block, or any other medical issue.  I will need to be tended to because my risk of bleeding out is very high.  I have been on blood thinners my entire pregnancy and will be on them for 6 weeks after our baby is born.  Given that, I won't be able to breastfeed.  Breast is best, but for women in my position we are unable to provide that because our child cannot have that medication in their system.  This makes me feel almost criminal, as well as this overwhelming push to not have a baby in a hospital.  Frankly, I'd rather be ALIVE and on medication than not be around to care for my child her entire life.

I do appreciate this documentary, and wish I could be on that side.  I just wish they offered more assurance to women in my position to make us feel more comfortable with not being able do as they do.

3352104,5,B0013LL2XY,"Before I bought this, I saw what some people wrote about nudity and profanity and was a little bit skeptical. Those people are so WRONG!!! This film is amazing!! It is an updated film about the benefits of home birth. This film is a documentary not a movie. It has not been edited to cut out the parts that may not sit well with everyone. It shows real women (including Riki) in their unique birthing processes. They do not claim to be comparing home vs hospital birth. It is simply a film that shows women that there is another birthing option out there. If you know that a hospital birth is not for you but you are unsure of what lies ahead, get this film. It is honest. Even when some births end up going to the hospital they didn't edit it out. It shows women at home and in birthing centers giving birth. They don't shy away from certain parts of the process as many films have done in the past. This film bares all. The nudity is shown within the context of birthing and the profanity as others have noted is by the mothers themselves in the heat of labor. Not just some foul mouthed women spewing swears just because. Even though the nudity is minimal, if you are uncomfortable in your skin as a woman and nudity bothers you then refrain from this film.

It is a film that I will be recommending for years to come, to open the eyes of women who are afraid of birth. This film sheds light on the fear-mongering that the AMA and the obstetrics industry have done since the 1900's. It questions why everywhere in the developed world except the US is home birth and midwifery the norm and not the exception? It questions why insurance companies will sometimes make it difficult or sometimes even refuse, to cover non-hospital or doctor based care for mothers to be even though it is thousands of dollars cheaper.

It is a film that at the very least will make you check up on your chosen hospital and see how many C-sections they do, how many interventions and episiotomies they perform. At the most it will set you on the path to making home birth a viable option for your future births.",1242518400,,2091,4.38659793814433
3352105,4,B0013LL2XY,"This personal and compelling documentary explores current attitudes toward home-birth in the United States. Following a home-birth mid-wife as she makes the rounds from prenatal to postnatal checkups as well as a few live births in the homes of women in New York City, ""The Business of Being Born"" asks the viewer ""what kind of birth do you want, and why?""
Helpful and informative interviews with myriad birth authorities (from Farm midwife Ina May Gaskin to OBGYN Dr. Jacques Moritz) are sprinkled throughout this film, offering both pro home-birth narrative as well as explaining modern medicine's reluctance to accept and facilitate natural drug-free, intervention-free, home-birth for low risk mothers.
Particularly interesting is the presentation of historical reasons in the United States for moving birth from the home to the hospital.
This documentary is both touching and engaging. It puts a human face on the birth experience.
While it exposes the medical community as generally uninformed about home-birth, it is not a condemnation of hospital birth.
I recommend this movie for anyone who is pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant. I also recommend this film for those employed in obstetrics. If watched with an open mind, it has the potential to improve the way that many hospital employees treat laboring women.
I believe that the most useful message this movie offers is that women should feel empowered to be active participants on birth rather than passive, unknowing and generally untrustworthy vessels.",1242000000,,1523,5.35
3352106,5,B0013LL2XY,"This film articulated so well the feelings that I had about my birth experience.  My son was born in a hospital 9 years ago.  I did not head to the hospital completely nave about things.  I had read some books and taken a class but I had never really discussed a birth plan with my OB.  I was young and very introverted at the time and I did not feel comfortable speaking up for myself.  I went to the hospital after a routine weekly check reveled that I was ""borderline"" for preeclampsia. Since this is a very serious condition, SOME of the intervention I received was probably necessary, but some definitely was not.  They gave me pain medication in my IV without asking if I wanted it. They instructed me to push before I felt I was ready and I ended up pushing for over an hour.  They removed the bottom of the bed and had me put my feet on plates that were way too far away from me and way too far apart to be comfortable and when I asked if they could just put the bed back the way it was they refused.  God forbid my comfort as a laboring woman inconvenience them.  In 11 hours of labor I was stuck to a bed the whole time. I was told what to do, what I was not allowed to do, and what they were going to do whether I liked it or not.

I am planning my next pregnancy in the next year or so and I have already started searching for Certified Nurse Midwives in my area to facilitate a home birth.  I do realize that preeclampsia is a very serious and dangerous condition for both mother and child.  If there is any indication that I may need to go to the hospital I would be totally open to that.  However, this time around no one is doing anything unless they explain to me why they feel the need to do it and I agree.

Thank you to Ricki Lake and Abby Epstein for re-affirming my belief that the hospital birth experience was designed for the doctors, staff, hospital and insurance companies and has very little to do with the mother and child.  My husband thought that the whole home birth thing was for crazy granola and tofu yoga hippies, but after watching this film with me (to my surprise) he agreed that a home birth should be our plan A.",1241827200,,2153,4.15421686746988
3352107,5,B0013LL2XY,"""The Business of Being Born"" is a fascinating and eye-opening documentary about the current state of our maternity health system and the alternative of home births.

Ricki Lake and Abby Epstein produced a compelling movie, that helps educate women on their options. It explains, why a lot of times giving birth in a hospital, with all its routine interventions, is ""over-kill"". The movie reminded us that giving birth is something that women know how to do intuitively. But somehow the medical community took over and now views pregnancy as if it were a disease that needs to be treated.

Yet, the statistics show that way of thinking isn't necessarily safer. The United States, with its high rates of scheduled C-sections and hospital births, also have very high numbers of infant deaths compared to countries with higher rates of natural births.

The bottom line is, if you are having an uncomplicated pregnancy, then giving birth at home with a trained professional (aka midwife) might be a very rewarding experience for you and your baby. Definitely something you should look into.",1238112000,,1085,5.050279329608938
3352108,5,B0013LL2XY,"The film intends to bring some transparency to state of birthing in the US. It doesn't conclude with ""doctors and hospitals are evil"" yet it also shows that homebirth is not just for hippies living in barns!

The film prompts its viewers to ask tough questions:

Why does the United States have the highest rate of maternal and neonatal deaths surrounding labor and delivery among all domesticated countries? With advances in medical techology and knowledge, why hasn't this mortality rate decreased in over 20 years?

What are other countries doing differently that is producing less injury and fewer losses of life?

Why do people spend more time researching what type of digital camera to purchase than they do researching the safest way to deliver their child?

Why has birth become such an event that women often anticipate with so much dread, instead of a natural part of life?

Why do intelligent, educated women spend 9 months of their pregnancy avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and even tylenol; but the moment labor approaches, they beg for maximum pain relief and expect this has NO effect on their baby?

Why is the cesarean rate increasing so quickly in our country, and should we be concerned about that?

Why are the majority of baby's birth certificates showing deliveries on weekdays during regular business hours?

What does an ideal birth look like? A ""healthy"" baby and a ""healthy"" mom? Or is there more?

As a culture, are we moving toward better birthing or away from it?

The film is an introduction to many aspects of the home birth and hospital birth discussion, and does a good job of keeping things balanced. I've talked to moms and dads, midwives, and OBs who have seen it, and overall it is a thought-provoking result.

For me, I'm a planner/researcher personality, so this film would not be enough to convince me either to have or not have a home birth. I've read at least 15 books on the subject now, and that is what has convinced me. However, my husband will never read those books, so this film was a good way to get him involved in the dicussion and decisions that we will make for our future children.

My top booklist if you're thinking about home birth: ""Pushed"" Jennifer Block 2007, and ""Born in the USA"" Dr. Marsden Wagner 2006, for current intellectual research and statistics involving birth. ""Ina May's Guide to Childbirth"" Ina May Gaskin 2003 and ""Birthing from Within"" Pam England 1998, for emotionally encouraging stories and feel-good about anticipating your birth type of ideas.

Hopefully, this film will be to birthing what Supersize Me was to fast food. Yes, we still have McDonalds around, and plenty of people eat there. But maybe more people will eat at home, or make more healthy choices. And McDonalds and other chains are removing transfats and selling salads. Generally speaking, the US population is a bit more aware of the dangers of overindulging in fast food, including the loss of life from obesity and obesity-related diseases.

This film would hopefully have a similar result: Yes, we still have doctors and hospitals around, and plenty of women are delivering in them every day. But a greater percentage of births would happen at home with licensed professionals. Hospitals would stop giving pitocin, epidurals, and other interventions to practically every woman in labor, and they would work to decrease their cesarean rates. Generally speaking, the US population would be more aware of options for birth, and would investigate the subject more before blithely succombing to a birth experience that is resulting in loss of life and permanent damage to women and babies across our country. I'm sorry, did I get on my soapbox just now?

3352112,2,B0013LL2XY,"Informative? Sure. Gives a new perspective on a broken system? Definitely. Entertaining? Er ...not really.

After talk-show host Ricki Lake experienced a bad childbirth in-hospital, she decided to try a midwife, and thus THE BUSINESS OF BEING BORN was ...um ...birthed. I can't help but think that some of this (not all) was a ploy by Lake to put herself back in the public eye; specifically, the movie industry. Although this is strictly a documentary, and other actors support various causes (from freeing Darfur to Tibetan independence), this one felt a bit more forced.

The reason I say this is that the entire documentary was exceptionally boring and exceptionally lopsided. I work in the medical field (as an RN) but not in an Obstetrics setting. I can, however, vouch for the terrible cost of healthcare and some of the impersonalness of those giving it (as this documentary pointed out). I've heard doctors talking about ""tee times"" on the golf course and the need to ""get home by dinner,"" so time is a big factor for physicians (the film pointed out that C-section deliveries peek at 4pm -- just prior to dinnertime -- and again at 10pm -- so doctors can get home to bed). Be damned whether the patient needs a C-section or not, doctors force the decision so that they can ""get on with their lives."" Cut and run!

Even with its interesting take on the care of OB/Gyn patients in the U.S., the film never delves outside of the States even though certain statistics are presented (including telling us that the infant mortality rate in the U.S. is one of the highest amongst developed countries). I would've liked to have seen at least one interview with a Japanese midwife or a European midwife, and have them show us how their system works. But we're never give the opportunity to see this for ourselves.

The boring nature of the film is that it never really finds its focus. Although the title of it is The Business of Being Born, it focused more on the plight of midwives and their care of expectant mothers at home or in midwife clinics. We drive around with midwives, trot down the road with midwives, listen to midwives talk on the phone to patients, and get to watch a couple of in-home births. Then we start the entire process over again.

And there's also a brief and confusing stint in which we learn one of the film's producers is pregnant and trying to decide on prenatal care.

3352124,5,B0013LL2XY,"I was so happy to finally see a documentary come out in support of homebirth and midwifery.  I reject the complaint that the movie is one-sided as a reason to discredit it... the ACOG and AMA statements against homebirth are also one-sided, yet are taken very seriously by many.  I am a veterinarian, and understand very well the medical implications of using and not using certain interventions.  I do not thing that OB's are intentionally judgemental, it is what they have been taught in their medical training.  Until true natural childbirth is taught to OB's, they can never understand what women like me want, or how to give it.  I resent that they are trying to take away my right to birth my babies the way nature intended.  I would never tell another woman that she could NOT go to the hospital if that was what made her most comfortable.  For my first deilvery, we went to the hospital with a doula and a birth plan that had been discussed in prior appointments.  Nothing that was discussed was allowed to happen.  I was not allowed to get out of bed to urinate once I was past 9 centimeters for fear the baby would ""fall out"", he was taken from me immediately and placed in a warmer, pitocin was continuosly pushed on me even though neither I nor the baby were in distress, and I was made to push lying flat on my back even though he was stuck and needed to turn.

I am grateful for this movie, because it can open the eyes of many women and reassure them that they ARE able to birth their babies, and that a trained midwife is able to safeguard mother and baby at home, transferring to a hospital if medical assistance is needed.  This is the European model, and it works well there.  Our nation is near the bottom in perinatal statistics, surely we can all agree that the current system is not working.  Thank you to Ricki Lake for opening a dialogue, and shame on AGOG and AMA for being threatened by nature and immediately shutting down any dialogue with threats of legislation.

This film takes you through the astounding history of childbirth in the United States, all the way to today - when one of every three births occurs by c-section, and childbirth is indeed a business rather than an intimate, natural event.  This is an eye-opening and thoughtful movie, one that shows women that there are other options available rather than succumbing to the ""standard"" childbirth today, which is sorely lacking.",1228521600,,652,5.382352941176471

Ricki Lake is a wonderful ""maverick"" behind this movie, but it is not about her. It is a very informative documentary on the history and state of maternity care in this country, which has completely lost sight of the normal, natural physiological process of childbirth.

Did you know that the World Health Organization recommends a cesarean rate of 10-15%, and that infant mortality increases when that rate is exceeded? Did you know that the rate of cesarean births in this country is over 30% and rising? But ask your OB and hospital what their rates are, because they may well be 40% or higher, depending on where you live!

Women and babies in this country are being done a tremendous disservice by the medical community. They are being robbed of an amazing, natural phenomenon for the sake of convenience and malpractice insurance.

3352128,5,B0013LL2XY,As a student nurse I would have to say that my observations support this film and their positive view of midwife deliveries.  Even a couple of maternal nurse instructors told me that they would use a midwife if the hospital equipment was near by. I have to say that I'm disappointed that my nursing school did not cover midwife delivery in lecture. How can future nurses advise patients (aka CLIENTS in our nursing books) of all the options available to them when we don't discuss alternative delivery options ourselves?  Women are now having c-sections so that their child can enroll in school more quickly.  The world is in such a rush we're rushing babies out of their womb before they're ready. The happiest baby on the block is another good dvd to watch.  I think the reason for the state mandated PKU test of neonates or newborns should be looked at because I think it has to do with the effects of splenda. Don't believe me? Just google PKU and splenda and then google PKU and newborn and test.  I tried to bring this observation up with my instructor but it went in one ear and out the other and I was told that I don't critically think.,1226620800,,1145,4.485576923076923
3352129,5,B0013LL2XY,"just watched this documentary and was very moved by it...to tears and anger.  i have had 5 home births and plan my 6th in a couple of weeks.  i have witnessed a birth in the hospital and it was exactly how it was portrayed in the film.  we went in completely wanting a natural birth and gradually the machines and complete strangers took over the birth.  eventually, the mother was told a c-section would be done if she didn't get on with it which gave her incentive to do all she could (even though she couldn't feel anything 'cos of all the meds they gave her).  i left the experience shaking with anger and wracked with sobs that they had deprived my friend of the wonderful experience birth is supposed to be.  i'm a wimp when it comes to everything but i will not be denied my right to give birth how i want to the way GOD created me to.  i hate that women have this taken away from them and that babies are put through torture with all the meds and interventions.  and that the doctors dare to tell all the women they mess with that it was for their own good, and how the doctors 'saved' their lives and that of their newborns...absolute lies in most cases.
please, consider home birth.  look into it in depth don't just 'go with the flow.'  before doctors took over women gave birth with their friends and family around them at home for centuries.  yes it hurts, but the rewards are forever.  i've never met anyone who regretted their homebirth and yet have countless friends have terrible hospital experiences.
a friend of mine who is a doctor said that there is no such thing as a 'natural' birth in a hospital...as soon as you walk in it is 'unnatural' and i totally agree.
blessings on those of you who have chosen and will choose homebirth...may that wonderful practice never be squashed by anyone!!
i know this has turned into more of a 'rant' than a 'review.'  i was very glad that someone in the public eye finally woke up and saw the truth and was able to shout it.",1226448000,,1981,4.350543478260869

3352131,2,B0013LL2XY,"My wife and I have briefly talked about midwives vrs OBGYN's. My wife was delivered by a midwife at home. We are open to the idea of delivering at home and learning about the different options as well as the risks.

We are awaiting our 2nd child.

What I saw that I liked:

I enjoyed the openmindedness of the movie presenting a positive viewpoint of home births. Pointing out that women having a different perspective than a lot of OBGYN's.

Being raised by an OBGYN I have had difficulties understanding the ""hospital is best"" perspective. I learned that an OBGYN was taught specific procedures, and tests that should be given to produce specific results. Med students are great at knowing different parts of the body, diagnosing illnesses, and working with urgent situations. They aren't trained adequately in the different ways the bodies healing systems work together. They don't view child birth as a natural process, but rather as a condition that needs to be treated. Due to this it can be hard for OBGYN's to believe in and understand alternative child birthing methods.

I agree that hospitals birthing is limiting. Because of this some OB's can not be as personal as they could be. They are given standards that they follow irregardless of what the women may want.

You can't blame OBGYN's. You can't blame hospitals. The whole system is full of quirks. But we can't live without them.

Things I didn't like,

The movie talked about OBGYN's only being trained in doing surgeries all day long. It stated that they don't have the proper training to do OB Care with the patients. They don't always provide the emotional care that the mother needs during the birthing process. Midwifes can fulfill this need more easily. The movie did not list any benefits about hospital births and is therefore very biased.

I didn't appreciate seeing a lady compeletly nude in the bathtub. I understand that it is part of the birthing process but they didn't need to show it in that way in the movie.

It stated that OBGYN's don't offer as personalized care as mid wive's can. I think that depends on the individual mid wife and OB. In the movie the lady talked about having a midwife and and OB and her never thinking about going back to the OB. What I got out of this is that she had an impersonal OB and a personal midwife.",1222473600,19,2319,4.661764705882353

My wife wanted me to watch this with her as we are having our second child in April 2009.  When our daughter was born in June 2006, we had the negative experience many women expressed in the film about the hospital experience.  We planned for a natural birth and ended up having multiple interventions including a c-section which was not what we wanted at all, and may not have been necessary at all with a home birth situation.  I would recommend this film to those parents to be out there, especially first time ones, to seriously consider home birth and to trust your natural, God given instincts.",1221782400,2,786,4.673913043478261

3352157,5,B0013LL2XY,"I am not a mother yet, although I have 3 furry cat babies, but I know that doesn't count. I have been trying to get pregnant for months now, and in that time I have been researching different methods of birth. I was in the hospital room when my older sister had my niece and I saw what a beautiful miracle it all was, but I was chagrined about the hospital staff and their methods. My sister was almost fully dilated when we got there, her labor going smoothly no drugs at all, and as soon as she was in the door they wanted to start her on Pitocen, I felt their need to get it all over and done with and my sister also felt that pressure and gave in, my niece was born within the hour.

The Business of Being Born touches on that subject, of women being given drugs to hurry up the process because the staff wants the mother to give birth, so they can either move on to the next or go home. I understand that, it IS a business after all, hospitals have to make money also and a natural childbirth isn't going to bring in the cash, or free up a bed. The Documentary also touches on how the surgical community, hospitals, doctors took childbirth out of the midwives hands and put pregnant women flat on their backs, drugged up and put through things they shouldn't have to be put through. Its illogical how women are treated, it's sad how its now out of their hands, and its scary that most people aren't informed of the choices they have.

Natural childbirth to your average American woman is pictured as painful and just for the Granola Hippie types. They don't see it as taking back their bodies, and minds, and truthfully allowing birth to be what nature intended. Do women actually think that they will die of pain if they don't have the drugs? Do women forget that our bodies are amazing? We have hormones, and chemicals and our physiology is crafted especially for giving birth! We aren't meant to be lying on our backs, with needles in our arms and some doctor telling us that ""its time"" and than pumping us with drugs that we know NOTHING about their long term effects, and causing our babies undue stress in the womb. Babies will come out when they are ready, not when Dr. ""Late to golf"" wants them too.

This film is wonderful, informative, I cried, I sobbed, I turned to my husband and said ""that's an eye opener!"" Thank you Rickie for having the courage to show what you went through, and what childbirth can really be like as nature intended!

3352158,5,B0013LL2XY,"""The Business of Being Born"" is a well done documentary that points out many eye opening facts about how the business of giving birth in the United States has gone awry. The information provided makes a lot of sense and has changed my views on the way giving birth should be performed. Using a midwife and home birth seem to be more beneficial to both the mother and her baby. ""The Business of Being Born"" gives many reasons why its beneficial for both mother and baby to have a midwife assist during labor. The medical establishment treats child birth like an unnatural medical condition and uses many unnecessary medical interventions to help speed along the birthing process. From watching this documentary, these medical interventions appear to have adverse consequences to both mother and child.

Some of the information shared in this documentary showed that 70% of the births in Europe and Japan are performed by midwives. Conversely, in the United States, approximately 1% of all births are performed by midwives. The United States has the highest infant and maternal mortality rate of all industrialized nations.

Giving birth is big business in the United States.... Doctors want you in and out of the hospital as quickly as possible to make room for the next woman to give birth. Doctors are performing more c-sections today than ever before. In the early 1970s around 4% of women had c-sections. Today something like 1 in 3 women are having c-sections in the United States. Having a c-section is major surgery with its own set of risks and complications. Many of the c-sections performed are unnecessary and some doctors perform/push c-sections in order to prevent malpractice lawsuits according what I saw in this documentary.

Midwives are very educated, highly trained specialists, whom have the interests of both the mother and baby at heart. They work with the mother's body and allow it to take the needed time to delivery the baby. It appears from watching this documentary that the women that used midwives had a better overall experience giving birth then that of those that used the obstetrics/hospital route. This is a highly enlightening documentary.",1217462400,,2174,5.033333333333333

3352162,4,B0013LL2XY,"*SPOILERS*

According to statistics, the infant mortality rate in the United States exceeds that of virtually every other nation in the industrialized world.  The U.S. is also the only place in which far more women give birth in hospitals than at home under the care of a professional midwife.  The documentary ""The Business of Being Born"" sees a connection between those two facts.

Executive producer Ricki Lake first conceived of this film after she delivered her first baby in the hospital and then felt cheated of the potentially beautiful and meaningful experience a home birth might have provided.  With the aid of director Abby Epstein, Lake has gathered together a group of women, couples, midwives and physicians who, through their own personal experiences and/or studies on the matter, help to provide evidence for her case that, for the large majority of women, delivering at home is preferable, on both a practical and spiritual level, to delivering in a hospital.  Lake has even allowed herself to be filmed in the process of giving birth to her second child at home.

This is an eye-opening and informative movie that admittedly provides really only one side to the issue.  But it makes a pretty convincing case for that side and certainly gets the audience thinking.  First, it offers a number of startling statistics, the prime one being that roughly one third of all babies born in America are now delivered through Caesarian Section, a procedure that is classified as ""major surgery"" but which is often treated with casual indifference by both physicians and patients (the shots of a Caesarian are far more ""gruesome"" than any of the shots of actual childbirth we are shown).  The movie also recounts a brief but somewhat disturbing history of obstetrics practices in the United States during the past century when many women were put into ""twilight sleep"" and missed the birthing experience entirely.  The movie also points out that, in a hospital setting, a ""cascade of interventions"" often prevents women from having the ultimate say in how they choose to deliver their babies. But the majority of the case is made through personal anecdotes from mothers and midwives concerning their own birthing experiences, as well as by the recording of many of those actual home births live on camera.  Interestingly, after all the successful home births, the movie ends on one in which the child arrives prematurely and is in a breach position and thus must enter the world in a hospital room after all.  It's an indication of the honesty and courage of the filmmakers that they didn't feel called upon to edit that sequence out of the movie.

Yet, for the most part, the film takes the multi-billion dollar medical industry to task for being too quick to use drugs and a scalpel in the birthing experience.  The movie also harshly criticizes the insurance industry for failing to recognize the much greater cost efficiency of home-birthing and hence refusing to cover it in their policies, thereby forcing many midwives to simply close up shop.

In many ways, ""The Business of Being Born"" is fighting something of an uphill battle in that it appears counterintuitive - especially to a generation raised on the belief that the medical industry can do anything - to suggest that a birthing process with a physician and modern medical equipment on hand could actually be less safe than a birthing process without them (though the movie is quick to point out that the midwives are all state-certified and trained to deal with any unforeseen complications that might arise).  Still, for women facing this decision - as well as for a society that for over a century now has frowned upon even the thought of natural childbirth - ""The Business of Being Born"" may serve as a paradigm-shifting event.",1215475200,15,3803,4.945054945054945

These homebirths were calm and nurturing even though they were painful - the mother was in control of her environment! I feel much more prepared for birth after seeing these women's births. They are so kind to share their intimate experience with us. I would have liked much more discussion around the C-section. It was interesting to show that homebirth isn't always the best option, and if you need it, you can get a C-section and the baby will still be okay.

My early students were grateful and excited to have access to instruction in a how a birth could be achieved without the drugs they had come to hate, and which they were told would keep them from feeling anything.  More than one woman described herself as feeling like a piece of meat.  Well, that changed in my day, at least for a few years.  Women experienced the euphoria of what we seem to almost universally describe as ""empowerment"".  The ""I can do anything if I can birth my own baby"" feeling.  Now we seem to have devolved into an age when women don't want any responsibility in their birth, don't want to feel anything, don't want to put as much time into preparation for birth as they might put into preparation for the purchase of a  hair drier!

3352187,5,B0013LL2XY,"I absolutely LOVED this movie.  I had a homebirth that was wonderful and truly life altering.  After watching this movie, (actually, crying through it, I was so emotional) I realized that my birth experience is the thing I am most proud of in all my life.  As well, it was the most loving thing I could do for myself and my daughter.  My confidence in giving birth without drugs or interventions, with my husband and midwives supporting me, in my own bed, has made me realize there is nothing in the world I can't do.  I gave birth to a life as nature intended - that is probably the most powerful accomplishment of all.

Having a homebirth requires that the mother (and father) take responsibility for the pregnancy and the birth of their child.  It requires attention to diet, exercise and gaining knowledge about the process of birth.  A midwife is your guide, your support and your lifeline.  It's not the easier route, but it's definitely the most rewarding.

Imagine a world in which all women believe they can birth their babies without drugs and interventions.  Imagine a world where women anticipate, not dread their birth day.  Imagine a world in which women speak of their birth days as proud accomplishments, not of a distateful experience they had to endure.  It is the world I hope for.

This movie, if it can open the eyes of even a handful of women to choice and gentle birth, may just spark the change in childbirth perspectives needed so that we can get to that world I hope for.

Even spiritual. I had control over how I wanted the experience to be and I never felt like myself or my baby was ever in any danger.
My second child was in a hospital (basically because my insurance wouldn't cover a midwife). I had little to no control, they did a lot of intervening and I ended up having a C-section that I thought was not necessary and completely avoidable. They wouldn't let me out of my bed and it's sort of hard to progress when you're flat on your back.  Because I wasn't progressing fast enough for them, it ended up being a much different and not pleasant experience.  I don't think that you have to have a home birth to be happy about how it goes but this at least gives you a great start in letting you know that you SHOULD be in control and that we need to speak up and be in charge of labor and delivery again. There are options out there and this film help you to realize that.  It was very inspirational. It could have been shortened a bit and I did find the F-word unnecessary.  And about the complaint that there is too much nudity, it didn't bother me at all because it is very natural and even nice to have less or no clothes when in labor or delivering.  It's not like it's a porn show, it's mothers giving birth to beautiful babies.",1211328000,2,1437,4.2299270072992705

I am so thankful that Ricki was not only brave enough to tackle this subject matter, but to also show her own home birth experience.  I did not find the movie to be preachy at all.  It really explored all the choices we have as women about our birth experiences.  Some women don't even know that they have more than one choice.  It exposes some of the lies and misconceptions that we all have about the medical industry when it comes to birth and I feel that this is something that anyone, male or female who is thinking about starting a family needs to see.",1211155200,6,604,4.357142857142857

3352192,1,B0013LL2XY,"There was great potential for this to have been a classic educational movie.  Instead of classy, it ended up as crass.  Most parents will probably be frustrated over the foul language used, to include the ""F-WORD"".  It was not some minor interjection made by some on looking bystander.  It was Ricki Lake's choice word to describe the emotion of her labor experience.  It was also Abby Epstein's, the movie's director, choice word in the heat of her labor.  It could have easily been edited out.  If you're religious in any way, you will also probably be annoyed by the repeated use of ""oh my god"" throughout the documentary.  Lengthy clips of completely naked women delivering their children at home started to be a bit over kill.  The movie was 85 minutes, but it could have easily been condensed to about 25 minutes.

I'm a strong advocate of home delivery and the use of midwives, but I can not recommend this movie due to its unnecessary profanity and unnecessary ""lengthiness"".  Trust me, if you're really interested in watching this movie; just see the 3 minute trailer.  It will give all the information you need without the added garbage featured in the movie.",1210377600,30,1169,4.7611940298507465

After watching this film I am definitely going for a home birth!

Watch this movie and pass it one to every woman you know!!",1210377600,,368,4.462686567164179
3352194,5,B0013LL2XY,"Well Done Ricki Lake and Abby Epstein. It is great to see you giving the women the power to make educated and informed choices. I like the fact that it DOES show both sides of the story (interviews with both people for and against home births). It also shows that midwives aren't reckless hippies who will bar you from entering a hospital as the director herself found out when she was rushed to hospital on the advice of her midwife. It shows that yes birthing should be as natural as the mother chooses but if needed those highly skilled OB's come in and help (as it happens in other countries).
 I am an immigrant from one of those countries that has mainly midwife care, there is a huge difference in birth outcomes and more positive experiences from the gals I have spoken to. Giving birth seems less natural and more medical when done under the supervision of an OB hooked up to IV's and monitors which make it impossible to move around and be in more natural birthing posistions! Speaking of OB's I cant tell you how lost I was when I found out I was pregnant and the OB didn't want to see me until I was 10 WEEKS, I was horrified - especially since you can do alot of daamge to a fetus in 10 weeks!!!!!!! Midwives are fantastic and since they are geared up for natural births and not so much surgery they should be ideally used more often for low risk mothers and this doco shows these professionals in a good light (Finally).
So for my next little one I will certainly look into my options thanks to this film as I wasn't even aware I had such options!",1209945600,,1561,4.32764505119454
3352195,5,B0013LL2XY,"After seeing 2 benefit screenings of the film, I am convinced it is a film that every single person in our country should see.  It's not just for women of child-bearing age.  When the profits from a maternity ward can make or break an entire hospital, we truly have a problem for the whole country - especially when so many people can't afford health care at all!

As a doula, I see too many mothers who don't understand the things being done to them (and not always FOR them) when they are in labor.  I see too many mothers with questions that aren't answered to their satisfaction.  I see too many mothers with too few options.

As good consumers, we research major purchases such as cars and houses, but very few of us have any choice about where and under whose care we deliver our children.  It's time we demand a voice and better choices for our own care!

While I am very glad we have the medical technology for birth available, not every birth warrants the use of most of that technology.  Birth is not a crisis waiting to happen - at worst, it is a natural disaster from which 97% of women know how to cope and recover from.  At best, it can be the most awesome experience you will ever have, and it should be that way for more women.

I loved this film.  I am buying two copies - one for myself/clients to borrow, and one for our local library.  Everyone should see this film!  Everyone!!!",1209600000,3,1399,4.3307692307692305
3352196,5,B0013LL2XY,"5 stars for being a timely piece: women NEED to learn the truths about childbirth and put it in context with the rest of the world and hundreds of years of history.  It was disturbing in some of the movie's early interviews that women said they wouldn't even consider using a midwife.  We are trained to expect birth to be traumatic and medicalized.

The only cons in this movie are more artistically centered and definitely LESS important than the need to see a movie like this in the first place.  E.g., the ending was anti-climatic with the director of the movie resorting to a hospital birth because the baby was breech.

I also agree with the reviewer who said more discusssion needed to happen about options when baby is in the less than ideal position... breech CAN be dealt w/ at home, for example.

I do NOT agree with the person who quoted the newspaper about the ""Michael Moore"" style editing. How insulting!  This movie SHOWS doctors who fully admit their limitations and expectations.  What's more, they show doctors of the opposite persuasion who question if home birth is safe since they don't do fetal monitoring etc.

I've had 3 hospital births and will never do it again.  The first 2 were with a midwife and it was fine... she was great w/ me.  But I still had to deal with hospital policies with the baby taken away for testing and having to get woken up in the middle of the night to be given painkillers.  I didn't know better. I, like too many women, figured that delivering a baby was something that just happened to you in a hospital like getting your tonsils taken out or something.

My third child was born with a traditional doctor in a hospital and it was a horrible experience.  They ignored my wishes, they insisted on a hep-lock, they refused to take my pitocin IV out after the birth and whenever I asked for it out, the nurse would ""go to check"" with the head nurse and never come back.  Or they'd soothe me ""sure, right after this bag.""  I had nurses who pretty much just strapped me to the monitoring and ignored me until I started moaning badly and then it was time to push.  I felt violated and without dignity the whole time.

It pains me that women expect this.  I have many friends who've birthed at home and it was the best experience in the world for them.  This movie needs to get in the hands of all expectant mothers just for the simple fact that they should CONSIDER other options and perhaps clear up their misconceptions about midwives being little more than some hippy babushka who comes in with herbs and potions.  Kudos to Ricki Lake for stepping us in the right direction.

***UPDATE***  I've now had two home births and stand by my hope that I never have to go to a hospital for delivery again.  They were so empowering and beautiful and RIGHT in every sense of the word.",1206144000,81,2825,4.47265625
3352197,5,B0013LL2XY,"I watched this movie and LOVED it.  I think it is a wonderful way of introducing the idea of midwifery, the crisis in current delivery practices, and how wonderful a natural childbirth can be.

I had both of my children in New York hospitals.  I was never pressured to have an epidural or pitocin, although pitocin was mentioned when I got to the hospital with no labor going, 14 hours after my water had broken.  I felt generally respected in my wishes. That said, I had my 2nd baby flat on my back and found the experience of pushing to be excruciatingly painful, largely due to my body position and due to the OB rushing my birth by trying to push back the lip of my cervix that last centimeter or so.  He was rushing me because he wanted my baby born on his shift, which was about to end.  While I can understand that, he compromised my comfort and birth experience for his own ends.

Generally, I think it is pretty crazy that women are being delivered by men who can't possibly have any idea of what the birth experience is like.  That description in the film of approaching a wall higher than any you have ever seen in your life and then somehow scaling it seemed to ring true to me. No man could possibly understand how that feels.

Birth is a very empowering experience, and it is also a great teacher for your first year with a new baby.  Labor teaches you to be in the moment, cope with each contraction, one at a time.  Many times when my daughter was a baby I felt this lesson to ring true. Rather than think too hard about the big picture I just focused on getting through the hour of crying, the next feeding, etc.

I applaud Ricki Lake for taking this on.  For showing us some absolutely beautiful birth scenes and for going after the current thinking head on.  Someone had to do it.  Our birth practices are truly in crisis.  When it comes to birth, I agree, less is more.  I wish I had had the courage to do a home birth with a midwife.  I wonder how much more positive and affirming my birth experiences might have been.",1205625600,8,2039,4.293193717277487
3352198,5,B0013LL2XY,"This is a letter I wrote my friend who missed the movie:

The documentary successfully conveys the theme, ""You're going to be transformed by your birth like it or not; it might as well change you for the good.""

I didn't count, but I guess about 30 or more women and two men came to the viewing on Sunday. About 2/3's I knew. The documentary showed excellent coverage of a few natural births purposely filmed for this project including Ricki Lake's birth, a midwife's reflection on her own birth, and others. These births with low profile midwives in attendance really emphasized the ecstasy and joy a mother feels after an unmedicated birth and connecting with the new baby. And it showed previously recorded segments of clips of Marsden Wagner, Ina May, Michael Odent, Robbie Davis-Floyd, and more all speaking on the problems with birth in American hospitals. It showed clippings and photos of the history of hospital birth: stirrups, scopolamine affect, tying women down to keep them in control. Showed segments of residents on rounds (which could have been in any hospital I've been in residency) totally clueless how to meet the needs of their laboring women. It was quick and fast moving, emotional and funny.

The Filmer, Abby Epstein, was pregnant during the making of this documentary. She was under an OB's care, until the 35 week check-up when she told him she was going with the homebirth midwife. On this day it shows Ricki Lake commenting on her small gravid abdomen. The very next day she went in to labor with a breech. The midwife transferred to the hospital and her OB did a C. The audience seem to conclude that sometimes ""you need a hospital."" Abby herself said, something like everything was wrong, preterm labor, breech, cord around the neck, IUGR-- the typical things a women says after a C. One of the reasons I took advantage of the second showing is that I wanted to follow the dialogue of her pregnancy better. It was apparent to me after a second viewing that chronic maternal malnourishment was the problem(not a last minute freak accident) and it was passed onto the baby and the birth outcome. Necessarily and sadly it showed the disruption in bonding and breastfeeding of this birth. I also saw a different attitude with Abby at the beginning than the other women, ""this movie one of Ricki's crazy ideas."" I don't think at first she fully appreciated what ""Birth"" means. I think she does now, but I don't think she did when she was pregnant. Not unlike most American women. Kudos to her for being brave to show all this in her movie.

I don't know if everyone noticed, but I noticed that the starring midwife did not wear gloves at the births (some water, some squatting). I am not sure what most Americans would think viewing this or would they even observe this detail. Other midwifes wore gloves, though. An out-of-town midwife at the second showing I went to, pointed out that this would probably be something the midwife and couple would have to discuss before hand.

Two women in the movie were squatting/standing when they delivered their baby. It reminded me of you standing/breastfeeding and holding your newborn. Definitely not what you see everyday. Two women, one in water and one of these women squatting were so internally focused (and not screaming) when the midwife asked the moms to reach down for their baby and pull him to their chest, I don't think the women even realized the baby came out. Beautiful births! All these ecstatic outcomes brought me back to my emotions with Scott and David being brought to my chest.

A tissue box was passed around the room. It was nice to be in a group with so many pregnant wanting this info and babies being held in slings and laps and not in containers.  The out-of-town midwife had a lot of insight to my probing.

I almost feel envious of the women who are pregnant who will have such a wonderful experience in the near future.",1205020800,13,3920,4.704081632653061
3352199,5,B0013LL2XY,"This is an excellent film.  I would encourage all expectant couples to watch this film together to expand your knowledge of birthing options.  We had a hospital birth with both a doula and midwife. It was a great experience and I would consider a home birth for our next child.
However, the movie could have given more information about doulas.  Our doula was a very positive and important part of our birth experience",1204934400,3,418,4.698630136986301
3352200,3,B0013LL2XY,"This film starts a discussion that our society needs to have, for that I commend it to you. However, like many recent documentaries, it is one-sided (in favor of midwifery), makes some questionable claims, and ""indulges in the kind of stunt footage for which Michael Moore routinely gets slapped"" (Chicago Tribune review).  For example, when the medical establishment is represented in the film, the individuals are usually self-critical - supporting the film's agenda - and they are rarely given the opportunity to rebut the many claims made against the medical practice. For instance, the so-called experts in the film talk about the power disparity and physician paternalism in the OB clinic; they claim that many obstetricians don't have the patients' best interests in mind and will do anything to drag them into the operating room to have a C-section (because this is most convenient for the doctors). This may be true in some cases, but it was not true in ours. Moreover, I find it hard to believe that in the modern climate of patient-centered practice that physicians on the whole are exercising this kind of influence and making these sorts of decisions. I think they are more interested in providing adequate patient care and creating a positive experience for each mom (which, by the way, has the upshot of increasing business and avoiding malpractice suits). In addition, the new buzz word among professionals and in popular literature these days is ""the birth plan."" Pregnant mothers are encouraged to have one, which means spelling out exactly how they want the labor and delivery to go. Furthermore, in our experience, the delivery nurses were great, and they fulfilled the role that a midwife or a doula might. Finally, many of the talking heads in the film pontificate that women who go into the hospital to give birth are ""missing the experience"" of what it means to truly be a woman and give birth the natural way. I find this judgmental attitude almost as offensive as those who argue that epidurals are wrong on the basis that the Bible says women ought to feel pain in childbirth since the Fall. My advice: consider both midwifery and the hospital and go with the option that works best for you. You could have a good or bad experience either way, so ask around for recommendations.",1204848000,24,2305,4.8951406649616365
3352201,5,B0013LL2XY,"This documentary does a wonderful job of introducing the ideas that motivate those who are working for change in the birth system in this country.  The filmmakers have really portrayed the reasons that many ""mainstream"" families are opting for birth outside the hospital setting in a way that makes them easy to process.  And they have done this without vilifying those who have hospital births and medical interventions.

Having had both a birth in a typical US hospital and a homebirth I can say that I would recommend that any healthy woman having a normal pregnancy seriously consider birthing outside of a hospital.  The care I received from my midwife was far superior to that from my obstetrical team and giving birth at home had positive effects not only for myself and the new baby, but for my husband and our first child as well.  The whole family benefited from the experience.  I only wish I'd seen this film before having my first baby!",1204761600,46,949,4.7560975609756095
3352202,4,B0013LL2XY,"The film does a good job of explaining the ""intervention cycle"" that is so common in medicalized births--the mother is hooked up to intravenous tubes and all sorts of technology, and thus there is inevitable pressure to use (or misuse that technology).  Anesthetics, which are supposed to ease the pain, lead to slowdown in the birth process, which leads to more intervention (pitocin etc.) and oftentimes to ""crisis"" into which the physician steps to save the day.  The film gives a fair amount of attention to the power of the physician over against the mother in medicalized birth.  The portrayal of the respectful and extremely helpful manner in which home birth midwives work comes across very well.

We give the film a four-star rating instead of five for several reasons.  We think it does not do quite well enough at explaining the reasons why home birthers do certain things--for example, why they often choose water birth.  Why husbands/partners might not wear a shirt when assisting the mother.  Why the home setting is generally superior to the hospital setting in terms of exposure to dangerous microbes.  There are good reasons for all these things, but they're not really explained in the film.

We think the film dwells excessively on the experiences of the director (Cara) and upon Ricki Lake.  It's fine to have these folks profiled in the film we just think they take too much screen time that could have been better used educate people further about non-medicalized birth.  This is one reason that the film starts to languish a bit in the second half.  Some of the language used on the film (casual swearing) will be unnecessarily offensive to many home birthers and potential home birthers.  The film did not mention the religious reasons some people choose home birth (we'd have loved to see interviews with Amish home birthers, for example).  We did think the contributions of Michael Odent, Ina Gaskin, and the other midwives (and the back-up doctor) were portrayed very well.

We have had six home births (four with well-trained midwives).  Our midwives definitely went the extra mile for us, and were genuinely interested not only in ""getting the baby out"" but in all aspects of prenatal, delivery, and early infant care.  They were extremely generous in their time and expertise.  In terms of theoretical and practical knowledge, our trained midwives were the equal if not superior to the typical birth-attending physician.  This perspective comes across pretty well on the film.

All in all, this is a good film.  It could be quite a bit better in terms of explaining non-medicalized birth to people who are unfamiliar with it.  But it's a good start and we recommend it to anyone interested in the topic.",1204502400,119,2733,4.934354485776805

They use misleading ""facts"" and show clips of Monty Python in a strange attempt to paint the medical community as insensitive and inept. Lots of fear based points punctuate key moments in the documentary to try to make you feel that hospitals can't be trusted.

Last 5 minutes of the documentary, the filmmakers rely entirely on western medicine for their baby to be safely delivered and cared for in NICU. Hilariously make a mess in poor cab driver's car on the way to a very necessary emergency c-section. What I want to know is, did they reimburse the cab driver for his troubles? They ask him to run red lights, then her water breaks in his back seat. Do you know how difficult that is to clean? The narrative they try to establish falls apart by the end of the documentary, due to their emergency and how all the western medicine that they were critical of ended up saving mother and baby.
