8718059,5,B00YB3HSE8,"Excellent material, of course.  Good mix of 'panel questions,' demos by Ben, demos by students and explanations by Ben.  The more 'human-interest-y' bits by Kita were interesting and valuable insights into Ben's regimen and mindset.
 Ben doesn't skimp or hold back - very detailed explanations repeated with close up camera shots.  The production was a notch up from many instructionals.",1513987200,,387,5.4
8718060,5,B00YB3HSE8,Excellent read. Has been extremely helpful in building my skill level. Very glad I purchased this book!,1488499200,,103,5.117647058823529
8718061,3,B00YB3HSE8,"This is clearly for a ""New"" shooter not someone looking to build their Skills as competitive shooter.

For someone looking to build their skills look at the ""Training to Win with Ben Stoeger"" DVD,  ""Skill and Drill"", ""Dry-Fire Training"" books.",1470528000,3,243,5.05
8718062,5,B00YB3HSE8,"This was a really good DVD.  He explain the way that he does things, but he also explained alternative methods and their advantages/disadvantages.  Good clear explanations and demonstrations.",1457827200,,191,5.785714285714286
8718063,5,B00YB3HSE8,"Great video, high production quality and valuable instruction!",1456790400,,62,6.875
8718064,5,B00YB3HSE8,"Without a doubt, this is one of the best DVDs out there for anyone wanting to get in to practical shooting.

Whether you're interested in IPSC, USPSA, 3-Gun, or IDPA... this is the DVD you get you started on the right track. All the fundamentals are covered and explained in a way to allows your skills to be built. Ben Stoeger not only breaks down the individual components, but also explains why he does things the way he does. Remember: Ben is a Grand Master who did not rely on raw and innate talent for his success - rather, hard work and diligent critical analysis were key to his success. This DVD allows you to tap in to his entire learning process and gives you what you need to begin shooting at a competitive level.

If you're already a top-level shooter and are simply looking to fine-tune your technique, this may not be the video for you. Nor would this be the product if you're dead-set in your ways and not willing to experiment and try different things. But for everyone else, this is a fantastic resource to give yourself some new ideas to integrate in to your shooting.",1436745600,3,1088,4.4623115577889445
8718065,5,B00YB3HSE8,"This is a great video. Well produced, easy to follow, and entertaining. I would recommend this for anyone wanting to learn the fundamentals of pistol shooting.",1436140800,3,159,5.153846153846154
8718066,5,B00YB3HSE8,"I have all the other books and videos by this author. Despite having read the practical pistol book two times, I still picked up something new from the video. I think it was worth the cost without a doubt.",1433462400,2,205,4.282051282051282
8718067,5,B00YB3HSE8,"Ben has once again created another great training tool in the form of a video this time. His new Practical Pistol Foundations is a must-have for new shooters, but there is also a lot of good information for those that have been shooting for a long time too.

Many training videos go right into advanced techniques, assuming the shooter knows the basics. And many shooters just want to learn advanced techniques before they master the basics. Without a solid understanding and mastery of the basics, you cannot advance into the highest levels of this sport, or any other sport. Sure you can progress for a while, maybe even reach a decent level without mastering the basics, but you will stop somewhere along the way and not progress further until those basics are mastered.  But this video is not just about the basics, yes, it does cover what you need to build a solid foundation of skills, but it goes further.

Ben covers various topics like stance, grip, draw, and trigger control. He covers reloading and talks about consistency vs speed, also about high vs low reloads. Transitions come next where Ben talks about your level of sight picture and how to lead with your eyes. There is also a section on stage plans and preparation for running the stage.

The video goes into a forum format where the six or seven other shooters in the video ask questions on different topics. The forum format was a bit distracting because it really made some of the shooters look pretty creepy in comparison to Ben's hot wife who was sitting among them. But I was able to get some good information out of the questions and Ben's replies. One great one was about self-analysis and what should I be practicing? I think Ben covered that well.

Another great section was on shot calling. Ben gave a great way to train for improving your shot calling which I am anxious to try later today.

Overall I think this is another excellent video by Ben Stoeger.",1433203200,6,1937,4.649122807017544
8718068,5,B00YB3HSE8,"This is an excellent quality DVD, in both production and content.

Of particular note is the section on shot calling. Using slow motion first person camerawork, he walks through calling shots. Showing the shot calling when in rapid fire was of particular value, I personally had some misconceptions that were cleared up and made immediate quantifiable improvements to my shooting. I can now shoot a 2 second Bill Drill all A's at 7 yards regularly, often with time to spare. This section is easily worth $35 by itself.",1433030400,,518,4.886363636363637
