2025884,5,B0001VLUSY,This is an impressive package for anyone into learning self-defense. I am very pleased with all the moves taught because they are set in realistic encounters that happen everyday to innocent people like myself. I am a victim of road rage and needed something like this course to defend myself if it ever happens again. Master Sexton is a tough guy who can teach his system very well and I feel more confident about taking care of myself with each viewing.,1110153600,21,455,4.62962962962963
2025885,5,B0001VLUSY,"This DVD is the real deal and a super buy. No unrealistic BS techniques just hardcore Hapkido take no prisoners street fighting self-defense that works. With over 3 hours of lessons I watch it daily and learn more with each viewing. Compared to other tapes I have by other so called Hapkido Grand Masters, Master Sexton would make many of these clowns cry like Babies in a real life or death all out street fight. As a former Navy Seal I can honestly tell you Master Sexton deals with reality combat not fantasy martial arts.",1092873600,33,525,4.536842105263158
2025886,5,B0001VLUSY,This is a great 3 DVD set on Korean Hapkido Self-Defense techniques. With over 3 hours of instruction I was amazed at the amount of material covered in each of the 3 Volumes. Hapkido Master Steve Sexton is a very impressive expert who defintely knows his stuff. His teaching style is easy to understaand and my friends and I were able to pick up the techniques very quickly while watching the DVDs. As a professional bouncer Master Sexton definetly talks from experience as to what Hapkido techniques work in life or death self-defense situations. There is no BS and the techniques are all hard core and explosive. If you want effective self-defense against every type of street attack then this a steal. Having purchased other tapes on Hapkido and various other martial arts this is by far the best in content and value. The production quality is high and with over 3 hours of Hapkido lessons this 3 DVD set definetly gives the best value for your buck!,1080259200,38,954,4.684523809523809
2025897,4,B0001VLUSY,"This was great value for money - 3 x dvds, well explained content. will definately be using techniques from this set in my centre.",1372032000,,130,4.458333333333333
2025898,3,B0001VLUSY,"I'm sure the instructor is quite good, and the techniques are fine. It's just impossible to practice hapkido on your own. If you want to learn it, great, but go to a school that teaches it. The DVDs aren't cheap, he does do a thorough job of explanation, sometimes too thorough, repitition is great for actual practice, but not while watching a DVD, one slow motion and one real speed would have been better. It's not like you can't replay it.",1357430400,,443,4.481481481481482
2025899,5,B0001VLUSY,"Excellent training dvd. Sensei Steve S. Fantastic!!! Worth every penny. Yes i would recommend to anyone & everyone that wants to learn Hapkido & self defense in general. Very happy customer! Looking for Hapkido kata forms, if any out there? Thanks!",1337040000,2,248,5.073170731707317

2025901,5,B0001VLUSY,"I highly recommend this Instructional DVD,because every Volume and Chapter are slowly and very well explained. Basic strikes and defense combinations ,and fight strategy are covered .Very few DVD""s can show you the proper forms , but this one did exceedingly well .This dvd is worth TEN stars .",1278806400,2,294,5.020408163265306
2025902,5,B0001VLUSY,"I have been meaning to write a good review for master sexton on this dvd,let me just say i have studied taekwondo and hapkido for four years and i have a few hapkido instructional dvd for reference but this one is by far the best. Every technique is explained clearly and like other customers say each technique is done slow,moderate speed and then real time speed,i give two thumbs up on this dvd collection and it was well worth every penny i spent,i just ordered skills of hapkido by HYE KYOUNG KIM and am awaiting to see it so i will be rating it also,thanks master sexton for the time,effort,and detail in the video i highly recommend this dvd

2025903,5,B0001VLUSY,"I purchased this as a beginner to the art of Hapkido. I've trained in other martial arts over the years, but have decided to explore Hapkido as I'm getting older and looking for a ""gentler"" martial art.  I'm one that likes to explore a subject thoroughly as I am learning. I found the instruction to be top rate in regards to the technique (again, understand I'm but a white belt). Steve goes even further in explaining the small details necessary for the practical application of the technique as well.

I have but two minor criticisms; First, I felt that Steve seemed a little unsure of just what he was going to say when he got started. He fumbled for the right words as if he was just winging the lessons. However, once he was actually showing and explaining the move he was superior. If you purchase this, don't let the first 5 minutes influence your view, the material is top notch.

Secondly, they need better quality video equipment and MUSIC. Honestly, my daughter and I chuckled at how terrible the musical background was in the transitions to the lessons. It sounded like something out of a terrible 70's martial arts film. I'm hoping that as Steve finds more success in his teach, which he surly will, that the companies putting together the videos will invest in better equipment AND music.

These two criticisms are VERY minor and do not affect the overall quality of this material. From the perspective of a new student to Hapkido, I've found it well worth the cost of the product.",1210291200,7,1496,4.633962264150943
2025904,5,B0001VLUSY,"I am an italian wing tsun/ kick boxing praticioner, for some years.
Actually, I am interested in all forms of combat.
The series of Mr Sexton is very completed and well explained.
The teqniques offered are sound and, in my opinion, effective.
I agree with some reviewer that has pointed out that the author  doesn' only show the moves but really teaches them and in a great way.
In my opinion you must buy this series; it shows you how to defend empty hand, against a weapon (knife and gun) and also with a cane, the hapkido trademark.
No doubt, buy it now, if you can.",1200355200,3,569,4.367924528301887
2025905,4,B0001VLUSY,"The Techniques and performance action is very well presented. There is defective sound quality, the sound quality changes, is distracting but is clear and can be understood. The 2nd DVD is label as the second volume on the outside lable, but when played it is presented on the TV as Volume one with volume one table of contents. However, the presentation of technques are not a duplicate of volume one or three, they are volume two techniques. If you don't mind the error, the presentaion is good. I will not return my purchase.",1192838400,6,528,4.688172043010753
2025906,5,B0001VLUSY,"My background: some years of informal judo/karate training and went back to shotokan karate class this year. As I got more interested in self defense issues, and martial art more suitable to street practice, I decided to buy this DVD. I had no previous knowledge of Hapkido, and I must say this dvd made me discover a new meaning of self defense martial arts. sounds and image are high quality, instructions are all very clear, Master Sexton (besides being 6th degree black belt) provides no-nonsense explanations wich are easy to follow. In maybe a total of 50 tecniques, I would say only 5-6 are a little too complex to be implemented in the stress of a street fight, the rest is pretty doable and devastating. That is, as Master Sexton puts it, with daily practice until you can repeat the tecs at lightining speed.
I would incourage to buy this dvd especially those people who focus a more self defense approach. One thing to note though: to practice you will absolutely need a sparring parntner, as all tecniques make use of grabs, holds and throws (judo alike) which practices solo aren't much effective.
In sum, a very good product.",1186012800,7,1139,4.728643216080402
2025917,4,B0001VLUSY,"What is up with that??? Why would something claiming to deal with self-defense incorporate the practice uniform into their techniques? What is up with them always wearing them silly pajamas? They should be demonstrating in normal civilian clothes if they want to claim to be for self-defense!! I only knocked one star off for that because the damn lapel/Gi whatever they call it seems to be unavoidable anywhere!, why don't they just burn them dumb things and get rid of them once and for all! You're trying to learn how to save your life and they are only interested in practicing in comfortable clothing? A lot of good stuff in here and reasonably priced at $30 for over 3 hours. But I just had to rant about them silly robes, if I ever get attacked by someone wearing a bath rub I will know just what to do! We are all safe from being attacked by Hugh Hefner.",1164931200,2,862,4.462025316455696
2025918,5,B0001VLUSY,"I have quite a collection of martial arts instructional videos (over a hundred) and I rate Steve's videos up at the top of my collection. Being an instructor myself, I am always looking to make my classes more interesting. Steve does a great job of getting his information across with a common sense and down to earth approach.",1159574400,11,327,4.655172413793103
2025919,5,B0001VLUSY,"While many martial arts videos and DVDs demonstrate self-defense techniques, ""Hapkido Ultimate Self-Defense"" actually teaches self-defense techniques to the viewer.

The DVD set consists of three DVDs, each of which is about 90 minutes in length.  Techniques in these DVDs include:

>Stances  >Single & Double Wrist-hold Escapes

>Blocks  >Lapel-hold Escapes

>Kicks  >Pushing Attack Defense

>Break-falls  >Defense Against Belt Grabs

>Defense Against Rear Grabs

>Defense Against Chokeholds

>Defense Against Knife and Gun Attacks

>Techniques For Using the Cane for Self-defense

... and much more.

Steve Sexton explains each technique, breaks down each movement, demonstrates the techniques slowly and then at moderate and full-speeds.  By following along with the DVD instruction and then practicing the techniques with a partner you can learn to effectively apply these Hapkido self-defense techniques.

Each technique is a basic, simple and most importantly workable technique that can be learned and used by anyone.  These techniques will work on the street, in a real self-defense situation and don't require years of martial arts training to learn.

If you are looking for a way to learn some workable, basic self-defense skill... ""Hapkido Ultimate Self-Defense"" is a good place to start.",1154217600,17,1299,5.701570680628272
2025920,5,B0001VLUSY,"In this information he breaks down everything in a simple to follow format. It would be well worth the money.

It did bring back memories of visiting master Steve Sexton's Hapkido school in Canoga Park CA In the early 80's. To watch him move and teach, It was very moving,and powerful, at the time  Fariborz Azhakh was an assistant instructor.

2025921,5,B0001VLUSY,Impressive practical techniques and very well instructed.  The DVD is a good value.,1146614400,5,83,5.384615384615385
2025922,5,B0001VLUSY,"I find Master Sexton's DVDs to be outstanding for the following reasons:

Instructor Sexton first covers the basics of stances and falls as well as punches and kicks.  Next, he covers a variety of defensive techniques against strikes, kicks, chokes, and holds. He demonstrates effective techniques against knife and pistol attacks. He even demonstrates defensive techniques using a cane and a staff.

The self-defense techniques presented are effective and efficient - they require little strength to execute. The techniques are first presented slowly, with every step explained in detail. The speed of execution is then increased. The techniques are finally presented in full speed execution but using slow motion video recording. Different angle of viewing is presented for the same technique.

The set of three DVDs presents a complete set of techniques against many different modes of attack.  The quality of the DVDs is excellent, with good picture and sound reproduction. The DVD set is great value for the price paid.

This is not a sport, but effective self-defense. For a person who has some training in the martial arts, and a good partner to train with, it is possible to learn the Hapkido techniques presented on this DVD set.  A lot of repetition with correct execution would be the key to mastering the techniques.",1137369600,16,1328,5.148837209302326
2025923,5,B0001VLUSY,"Master Sexton gives an easy to follow instruction on hapkido techniques that really work. He shows everything nice and slow explaining every move then he shows the move at full speed. I've been in the martial arts for nearly 30 years and this is by far the best instructional dvd i've seen,oh and the cane techniques Master Sexton teaches are awsome. I certainly hope Master Sexton brings us more instructional dvd's in the future. five stars all the way.",1117756800,21,455,4.772151898734177
2025924,5,B0001VLUSY,"First let me say I didn't pay $69.95 for this. I used one of Amazon's optional stores who had it new for $29.95. It is well worth that amount!!

I would say this amounts to three comprehensive one on one lessons with Mr. Sexton. The techniques are practical and not 'movie moves'. It does help to have some martial arts or boxing skills to get the most of the lessons. I have added several of the techniques taught to my bag of tricks.

5 stars!! I am quite satisfied...",1115683200,17,470,4.269662921348314
2025925,5,B0001VLUSY,"Although a black belt in karate, I've always had an interest in some of the other martial arts disciplines.

After watching this great tape, I actually feel like going out and looking for a good hapkido school to study at. This is an outstanding series of tapes and I just know they are going to get alot of viewings in the future.

Steve ""Roadhouse"" Sexson is not only a great martial artist, but he's also a very good teacher as well. There are dozens and dozens of techniques demonstrated in these 3 dvds and Steve will walk you through each technique several times so that the technique really has a chance to sink in. And while I was impressed with the technique being shown slowly on a step-by-step basis, the effectiveness of the technique really becomes apparent when Steve demonstrates it at a real speed.

There are some very wicked and deadly looking choke and joint locking techniques outlined on these dvds. I am going to make it a point to ""cherry pick"" a few and incorporate them in my own martial arts training

If you have even a passing interest in the martial arts - or are seeking to learn a few self defense techniques - I can't think of too many sources that I would recommend higher than these dvds.

And the fact that Steve actually incorporates these techniques in his day-to-day job as a bouncer certainly provides him with a degree of credibility that may not be possessed by a martial arts movie star..!",1114128000,28,1431,4.552529182879377
2025926,5,B0001VLUSY,"This set of three DVDs are some of the best on the market for Hapkido self defense techniques. In addition to excellent work behind the camera--plently of angles--the teaching manner of Master Sexton is awesome. He takes the time to cover all possible situations for the student.
