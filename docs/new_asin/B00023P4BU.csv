Rocket Power is a great concept and it is disappointing Nick does not produce more of it for DVD.  This Movie is pretty good.  A good concept to explore the X factor somewhere other then the Santa Monica pier (or whereever they are).  Occassionally the animation is weak.  The message about women is poor (""fat chicks don't get dates"").  The message is about relationships is poor (""Meet gorgeous woman and ask her to marry you in one week."")  Even Reg (Rocket Boys older sister) regularly has to stand in the shadow of her hero brother.  But it is thoroughly cleaver and enjoyable.  HEY NICK!  More On DVD!",1114732800,10,690,4.675
2059568,5,B00023P4BU,"Finally, RP on DVD/Video!  My kids (ok, and I) have waited along rime for anything Rocket Power to arriveon Dvd and video and this was well worth the wait.  release some more! Its awesome!",1093219200,7,188,4.5
2059569,4,B00023P4BU,"In this movie, the Rocket Power gang goes to Hawaii for a summer vacation. Otto is obsessed with surfing the notoriously dangerous Banzai Pipeline. The first night they're in Hawaii, Ray meets Noelani, who was good friends with his late wife. Much to the kids' annoyance, he begins to spend lots of time with her and less with them.

An interesting side event is Sam discovering a Tiki that seems to curse the vacation.

It has drama and a little mystery thrown in. It is also hilarious. I cried laughing the first time I watched it. If you like the show on Nickelodeon, get yourself a double dose of it.",1091059200,9,604,4.4818181818181815
2059570,5,B00023P4BU,"I enjoy the Rocket Power series. And so I liked ""Island of the Menehune"" as well.

 *Spoiler*

 The group goes to Hawaii. While there, they meet Tito's (quite numerous) family. One of whom Ray gets smitten with (much to the irritation of Otto and Reggie). Things just keep seeming worse and worse from the sibling's point-of-view, as Ray keeps wanting to spend time with this other woman, and not with them. So, after so many times of being brushed-aside, they decide to go do their own thing... only to end up in big trouble!",1090972800,5,526,4.5638297872340425
