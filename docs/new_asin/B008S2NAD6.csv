5180516,5,B008S2NAD6,I truly enjoyed the movie. It had singing but not a lot which was nice. Good acting. Nice movie for quiet afternoon.,1355529600,,116,4.318181818181818

5180518,5,B008S2NAD6,This was a great play. NO QUESTION ASKED I will watch this movie again and again. It was emotional even for a grown man,1352678400,4,119,4.0
5180519,1,B008S2NAD6,"I have no idea what this was all about....I kept waiting for the real movie to start.  It was like a grainy old sit com with poor acting, and I thought maybe this was her job and pretty soon the movie was going to start when they stopped shooting the sit com...but evidently not.  Stay away from this one.  Poor acting, pathetic and horrible quality.",1400284800,,350,4.3538461538461535
5180520,5,B008S2NAD6,I enjoy movies especially movies with good plots and all my favorite charcters I like to watch and great entertainment.,1398038400,,119,5.0
5180521,5,B008S2NAD6,"See what money can  do, make you really do not love your family & turn against the one you love, but it was a good play, I love it, getting ready to watch it again.",1388793600,2,164,3.6857142857142855
5180522,2,B008S2NAD6,"I liked the actors in this play, so I watched the play. I've seen plays before and I know that you will usually have overacting in a play, but this was sometimes way over the top....like a spanish soap opera more than what I'm used to in a play. There were times where the actors didn't seem to know their cues and where to start speaking their lines. There was a message in the play (the title was the message and it was stated several times during the play). I think the list of actors saved the play from being 1 star (nice to see familiar faces), but at a 2 star rating, it still wasn't a good play that I would recommend or watch again.",1381449600,2,641,4.095238095238095
5180523,5,B008S2NAD6,I love Robin and all her movies.  The twist and turns was unbelievable.  There was definitely a message in this movie. I loved this movie.  I can't wait to see more movies like this one.,1381104000,,186,4.257142857142857

5180525,5,B008S2NAD6,in the beginning i was a little disappointed but i'm glad it did turn out the way it did. Remember you can't always run from your past or believe everything you hear,1371081600,3,165,4.1875
5180526,2,B008S2NAD6,"Some of the acting in this was good, but, I didn't care for some of the language and really disliked the way they portrayed someone being saved. This movie could lead people to believe they were on their way to heaven falsely.",1370217600,3,226,4.404761904761905
5180527,5,B008S2NAD6,"this movie or play which ever it was, was great I love the story line and the actor and actress was great I would recommend this one to everyone.",1368057600,3,145,4.0344827586206895

5180529,4,B008S2NAD6,"I almost turned this off when I heard the laugh track and witnessed other evidence of poor production, however, this movie is refreshingly deep. The story is very compelling and meaningful and I am very glad I watched it till the end.",1365724800,,234,4.595238095238095

5180531,4,B008S2NAD6,"Here's a lesson in being grateful for your accomplishments without throwing it into the face of someone who is less fortunate.  Just know that just as you were able to obtain wealth and riches, it can be taken away in a flash.  Remember to reach back and help indigent people.  You will be blessed even more.",1364428800,,308,4.464285714285714

the video have great actors in it especially robin givens she is my favorite actress. i truly love her she inspires me. she is such a beautiful person on the outside and i'm sure she is the same inside as well.this video touched my heart i sheded  tears when they united with there father.the pain that they all felt i felt as well. anytime you can touch a person that strongly by video you know that you have produce a great video.

5180534,5,B008S2NAD6,"To those who didn't give this a chance yet rated this movie/play, I urge you to go back and see it through til the end.  As a matter of fact, give it about 20 minutes and I guarantee you won't turn it off.  Yes its set up similar to a stage play yet the content flows like a movie. The reality of the message is powerful and I'm sure you would change your rating once it was over.  I give a lot of movies a chance that aren't worth the disc they are created on so I have seen my share of B list, boot leg, low budget movies.  However, this is not one of them. It's messages like this that should make it to the big screen.  The case performed beautifully providing humor and not just a believable story but a reality in the lives of many.  This is WORTH paying full price to own. I'm certainly going to watch this again.  Christopher Williams and Robin Givens surprised me on this one.",1357430400,,885,4.08092485549133
5180535,4,B008S2NAD6,"Loved it, The movie went in a direction I never expected. Wished it had been a movie and not a play. Robin is Robin inthe play. But really good",1357257600,,143,3.9655172413793105

5180537,1,B008S2NAD6,"I wish I had read the reviews first. This is a PLAY not a movie. We were going to watch it since it's raining out and once we realized it was a play (NOT IN THE DESCRIPTION), I felt ripped off.",1356393600,,193,3.731707317073171
8530173,5,B008S2NAD6,This play truly resonated with me. As a black African American woman it truly touched home. I grew up never really spending time with my father or truly getting to know him although he always took care of me financially. It still has left a huge hole in my heart. Now my father is gone and it's too late.to form that relationship. All the money in the world can never replace that feeling. Ijs. I forgive him but I do see that it has had a huge impact on my life.,1520294400,,463,4.0989010989010985
