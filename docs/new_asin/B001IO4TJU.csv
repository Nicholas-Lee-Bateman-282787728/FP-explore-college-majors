8311218,5,B001IO4TJU,"A group of girls in a summer math make up class accidentally cause the food poisoning of the entire brass band and decide to take their place to play at the next ball game. They're just doing it to get out of the math class, but when the regular band members quickly recover and they have to give up their instruments they discover they have really learned to love swing music.

Their adventures in earning money to buy their instruments are hilarious. They flood the supermarket they go to work for and when they try to collect mushrooms in the forest they run into the biggest, most vicious boar you have ever seen. Then they have a problem of finding a place to practice. Who wants to hear a band that, being new, is pretty bad. They do learn though and have a chance to preform at an annual concert, but almost don't make it in time. Also, the girls in the movie are really playing their instruments and they are really good. The music is not dubbed.

This is a really great funny touching and good natured movie. There are some very good well defined characters, and the acting is great. I am surprised how well the humor in this film translated from Japan to the U.S. Humor usually doesn't travel well from one culture to another, but the humor comes through here. The subtitles are also really good. It's a movie about teenagers who aren't really bad but just a little lazy who accidentally find something they really love to do, and about their math teacher whose secret loves are jazz music and the school's music teacher.

A friend sent me their jazz performance in an email and when I saw it something told me tract this movie down and buy it. I'm very happy I did. Very recommended.",1309392000,8,1694,4.440514469453376

Use a search engine like Google to search for ""Swing Girls"" (use quotes) and two YouTube videos pop up close to the top. The 10 minute one contains all of the 6 minute one, so watch the 10 minute one.

It's a movie about teenagers starring teenagers, and apparently G rated.
Several sites say that all the swing music is really played by the actors!",1305504000,,468,4.318181818181818
8311220,5,B001IO4TJU,"I first saw this movie as a treat in my Japanese class, when we got to slack off after finals. I was blown away by how much I loved it.

The direction is quirky, the writing is funny and the editing is extremely well done: Swing Girls tells the story of a group of Japanese slacker schoolgirls who accidentally end up poisoning the school's brass band-- and then decide to replace them to get out of detention.

Aside from a few broad cultural differences, what surprised me was how well Swing Girls translates for an American audience. This is just as classic a teen movie as Mean Girls, Bring it On or 10 Things I Hate About You. It balances humor and romance, the realistic and the ridiculous, suspense with satisfaction.

I don't care where you're from-- Swing Girls is worth a watch.",1236988800,14,788,4.496503496503497
