8133751,5,B000GPP3HY,"My son is nearly two, and he has loved this DVD since the first time we watched it.  He loves singing along with nearly every song, and while most of it's still gibberish to my husband and me, ""E-I-E-I-O"" along with the animal sounds of Old McDonald come out loud and clear.

I am also hopeful that other colors will soon be coming out of his mouth thanks to this DVD.  Currently every color is yellow, but with the nice rhyming scheme of the color bits, I think he will have the other basic ones down in no time.

The series of bits on shapes keeps his attention nicely.  We are all drawn to the woman's voice.

Using a train as a connective theme is also a favorite of my toddler.

Nice job, QuicKutz!",1155513600,,703,4.201492537313433
