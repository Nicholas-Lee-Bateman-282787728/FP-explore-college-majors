8158864,3,B000KRNKO6,"loved the work out dvd, but for some reason I can't always get it to start.  It will start, but only after I monkey with it for a while.",1476230400,,136,3.689655172413793
8158865,1,B000KRNKO6,"I am very disappointed; just a waste of money. I really thought it would be awesome.  This is such a routine DVD; No motivation at all, anybody could have put this together? She discourage me from purchasing any of her future DVD's. She is one of best trainers but she missed her beat on this one.  Sorry!",1344211200,2,305,4.333333333333333
8158866,3,B000KRNKO6,However this is not for overweight people who need to lose a lot of weight.  There aren't enough modifications for out of shape people.  I would have liked to seen that.,1325203200,,169,4.419354838709677
8158867,5,B000KRNKO6,"THis is one of my fave workout DVD's, and I have a lot.  It moves fast, covers a variety of exercises and body parts, and is pretty fun.",1301529600,,136,3.857142857142857
8158868,3,B000KRNKO6,"This product is more for beginners, maybe some intermediates.  It is well cued and easy to follow, doesn't require special equipment.  It was disappointing in that it is little excerpts from other workout dvds by Jeanette Jenkins.",1266105600,4,230,5.1891891891891895
8158869,5,B000KRNKO6,"I have over 100 workout dvds so I have much to compare it to whenever I get the fancy to purchase a new one. The price of this dvd was really good so, to be honest, I figured maybe I'd find one or two good pieces I liked on it and it would be worth it. I was wrong. This whole dvd packs a great punch!

CUEING and ease of following along: The best instructors give a great workout but shouldn't require a degree in choreography to follow along. I may work out 6 days a week but I have very low coordination for complicated and rushed steps. Great cueing here which means I kept up the entire time and, therefore, got great cardio into my workout with zero pauses or having to rewind

SCULPTING AND CARDIO: Studies show your best workout will offer cardio to pump up the heart and burn inistant calories but also sculpting so that you build muscle (which continues to burn calories long after a cardio workout does and also increases metabolism via the muscle building which requires more calories to maintain.) Check! This offers both. New to sculpting? No problem. On this dvd her instructions are very clear so you do the moves right for maximum results. An expert already? No problem. She does enough reps that you can up your weights to whatever you wish and get a great workout.

Another bonus? Wanna workout husband and wife team or girlfriend boyfriend? She has a man on the dvd too and suggests weights for him and suggests weight amouonts for women so you can both follow along!

She works various muscle groups very well and sculpting but also provides some cardio as you do it so your heart rate stays up

AND

you also get a kickboxing segment for all-out cardio. Even if you are new to these moves her cueing will allow you to easily keep up . I wish this was longer so that I could do a combo of just cardio sculpting and the kickboxing for more caloric burn(the flat 20 min of cardio if you combine the two doesn't quite hit what it should) ...it's almost enough but a little more would be helpful. Oddly, the kickboxing ends when she says ""now lets do squats!' and does one and then it cuts to yoga. So I think it was originally planned to be longer and then edited.

CALORIE BURN: I wear a heart rate monitor so I know first hand how great a workout is for burning the fat. The one will offer good caloric burn but I needed to workout longer than the the 30 minutes I usually do in order to get there. The 20 min of cardio if you just want cardio won't be enough, so plan for about 35-40 min and add in some of her yoga or ab work if caloric burn is your desire here. Not a problem with as many sections as this dvd offers.  Even if you just do the warm up, cardio sculpt, and kickboxing and save the other workouts for later you'll get a decent caloric burn; add on a bit more and you have a full workout.

VARIETY: Muscles have memory and if you do the same workout each day your body will adapt and become ""good at it"" to the point that you actually don't burn as many calories, research shows. The beauty of having this MANY different workouts on one dvd is that you can mix it up so you don't experience this even if you only have one workout dvd or a few.  This one has warm up and stretching, cardiosculpt, kickboxing, pilates, flow yoga, pilates, abes and legs, and stretching workouts all on one dvd!

ABS: She chooses moves, even outside of the abs specific workout that allow you to work those abs muscles during cardio and sculpting because of the turn of the body...so while hyou are working your arms and legs in one move, you reach to the side and also work that core. Very smart.

TRAINER PERSONALITY: She is great in this dvd. Warm, comfortable, no nervous giggles or having to forcefully fill the silence with silly phrases. She's a joy to watch. Her outfit is, um, interesting (bikini top and long gogo pants) but I forgive her that because she is one real motivator and perfectly comfortable to follow along her great cueing.

MUSIC: Very varied. Keeps my interest. Goes great with the beat of the moves.

SETTING: outside, nice day. Nice

Caloric burn: B minus for 30 minute workout, A plus total workout
Trainer Cueing: A
Strength: A
Cardio: B plus; would love kickboxing to last a bit longer for more cardio mix
Ability to use if beginner or advanced: A (she will guide you)

Overall Rating: A...If you had to buy one video, this would be a good one. The price was great and there are so many different workouts that you pack a punch into what you get.

One negative: I couldn't seem to pick out just 2 or 3 workouts such as choosing ""warm up, cardio, yoga""...you had to forward to the next segment but that's not a real problem for me.

Something humerous to look for although it has nothing to do with the quality of the dvd: In the intro she is wearing a VERY low revealing top with a very obvious ""bubbie"" job. Then the dvd starts and she has no ""bubbies.""  Apparently the intro was filmed after the video which I found quite funny...though it, obviously in no way, affects my rating. Just thought I'd throw that entertainment your way.

A new favorite for my collection!!",1244505600,16,5116,4.348373557187828
8158870,5,B000KRNKO6,"I like being able to do the first half of this DVD when I want to get my heart rate up, but don't have much time. I use the second half of the DVD for days when I want to stretch out and tone up, but don't feel like doing a full workout.",1238976000,,237,3.490566037735849
8158871,5,B000KRNKO6,"This a great workout if you have only 45 min and I think that the description is misleading. Most people will think they would not be able to get much for the 10 min segments but trust me, they are all fiery and you really feel like you have seriously worked out afterwards. Jeanette is her usual bubbly self and guides you through a wonderful 45 min which makes you sweat and feel wonderful afterwards. A great buy!",1214179200,2,416,4.346153846153846
