4099521,3,B0039ZBLZG,"My daughter is now 23 months old, and hardly a night has gone by when we have not read Goodnight Moon.  It is a part of our daily routine.  When I found a version on DVD with sign language, I jumped at the chance to get it.

We have watched it a couple of times now.  My daughter is enjoying it very much.  The only thing that keeps me from rating it 5-star is that the sign language interpreter never smiles.  In fact, her face is almost sour looking.  As an adult I find that distracting.  All-in-all though, still a good purchase.",1347235200,2,533,4.1568627450980395
4099522,5,B0039ZBLZG,"Amazing ASL story-telling combined with classic and new children's stories made this DVD series an instant hit at our house, where we have a bilingual deaf child being raised to speak English and use American Sign Language. As parents this video really helps us see  fluent signing along with the English translation. For our child these videos are just charming and fun. If I had to find something to criticize, I'd say there just aren't enough stories! Three stories on each DVD and only three DVDs in the series, we would love to see a lot more like this.",1296777600,,558,4.636363636363637
4099523,4,B0039ZBLZG,"To improve vocabulary, comprehension, and fine motor skills, this October a series of DVDs comes out of Scholastic Storybook Treasures where you can now introduce your child to Sign Language!

Goodnight Moon...and more great bedtime stories
1 Disc DVD being released October 26, 2010

This DVD has a running time of 36 minutes plus extras of sign language vocabulary, comprehension quizzes, alphabet fingerspelling, and a read-along feature. The first story is Margaret Wise Brown's ""Goodnight Moon"", illustrated by Clement Hurd. This story always makes me think of the Christopher Walken version of him reading this story and the Animaniacs animated version of it which makes is nostalgic and hilarious all at the same time. It is adapted from the book with a musical score. The second story is Carter Goodrich's ""A Creature Was Stirring"" which is a new adaptation of the classic Christmas Poem. The third story is ""Gladys Goes Out To Lunch"" by Derek Anderson where kids can go on an adventure with Gladys the gorilla as she leaves the zoo after smelling something delicious and has a great desire to find out what it is. Each of the stories has a sign language professional on the screen telling the story so your child can practice along.",1288483200,3,1241,4.961538461538462

8392587,5,B0039ZBLZG,We are learning ASL as a family and these classic stories are brought to life by animated ASL storytellers. We love seeing the signs 'come to life' as our vocabulary expands. Storytelling at its best! Thanks you to scholastic for putting together such a great series.,1367280000,,267,4.826086956521739
8392588,5,B0039ZBLZG,"Just like the other ASL storybooks! I was pleased to see the signing was going along with the pages in the book. I didn't know what to expect it would be like but quite pleased with the format. They zoom into a page in the book, added a small bit of animation to the page & then the signer is super-imposed onto the screen. The book is being narrated at the same time. My 25 year old niece with Downs Syndrome lived it! We both loved Manny Rodriguez (one of the signers)!",1358553600,,471,4.130434782608695
