8467400,2,B005DSG40O,"I'm a little suspicious of the other reviews of this product...they sound like satisfied customers but not everything promised comes on the DVD.  I'm very interested to see if this information actually DOES get us out of our timeshare, but the crucial piece of the puzzle- The ""do it yourself"" forms that they promise are nowhere to be found on the disk and I've written to their website twice now asking how I can recieve (or access) those forms and have received NO REPLY.  As soon as I receive the legal forms and go through the process I will update this review.  Until then, I have to saw ""beware""!",1322524800,,603,4.513761467889908
8467401,4,B005DSG40O,I get bombarded with timeshare solicitations. I'm glad I payed attention to this one. Saved a lot of money and reduced my stress. This DVD has payed for itself quite a few times over. Minus one star because it took me a few minutes to find the forms I needed on the website.,1316563200,2,274,4.188679245283019
8467402,5,B005DSG40O,My initial thought was that this was another one of those resale gimmicks. After watching the DVD I was pleased to find information that I could put to use.  Everything was simple for me to apply. Thanks to the information I learned I'll never pay another maintenance fee again,1315958400,2,277,4.653061224489796
8467403,5,B005DSG40O,"The information presented to me on this dvd was more than an eye opener. I found myself nodding my head in agreement on multiple occasions. I was able to use the information to rid myself of my timeshare.  Thanks, Brain D TX.",1315958400,2,225,4.357142857142857
