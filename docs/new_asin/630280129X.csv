7832065,4,630280129X,"Half Wits Holiday (1947)
Curly's last official stooge short, two professors wanna get a guy whose in the lowest form and when the stooges show up after Moe brains Larry and Curly the professors found their men, they have about 2 months to rearrange themselves from men to gentlemen, if successful they get $1000. Sadly this was the short when Curly suffered a major stroke which disabled him from doing anymore stooge work although he had a cameo in Half Wits Holiday and Jules White made the other stooges finish the short without by themselves and they get into a pie fight, good short but it's actually a remake of the classic Hoi Polloi (1935) and the pie fight was actually reused in Pest Man Wins (1951) Scheming Schemers (1956) and Pies and Guys (1958).
3.5/5
Horses Collars (1935)
One of the weaker stooge shorts but Curly's line 'Moe, Larry the Cheese' when he goes crazy as he spots a mouse is a resciment of Punch Drunks and although there were some funny parts, the short overall is far from it being a classic 2.5/5
How High is Up
The boys are fix-it men who are sleeping underneath the truck and when the fire hydrant goes off, it hits the boys bed and they flow on the street and a boys actually get hit by a truck and Moe wakes up Curly while the cop is standing right next to him, then Moe tells Curly to go fix the puncture and he mistakes it from a salami that fell out of Moe's sandwich and the dog eats it when the tire goes flat and meanwhile there's a hilarious scene when Curly gets stuck in a sweater and Moe and Larry try a variety of things to get him out, Larry: 'Looks like a V-8)' Moe: 'Have you ever heard of a V-5' Larry: 'What's that, a new car' Moe: 'No it's an old sock' as he slaps him and they finally got Curly out of his sweater, later the boys become construction workers working on the 97TH FLOOR! Curly gets dizzy and from there, the short gets even more hilarious, there's a hilarious scene when Curly falls off the building only to land on a barbeque pit or when the boys were eating 'hot dogs' on the job or when the hot rivet falls on the bosses shirt and the boys decide to quit the job, this short is a classic, so much a classic that this tape is worth it for How High is Up alone. 5/5",1052352000,,2234,4.22196261682243
7832066,4,630280129X,"HALF-WITS HOLIDAY (1947) is sad, but excellent. The party scene is funny with it's pie fight, but the sad part is how Curly is sick. This is his last film. He turned in a good short, and did Moe and Larry. You will forget about Curly once the wild pie fight starts. A remake of HOI POLLOI (1935) and later remade as PIES AND GUYS (1958).
HORSES COLLARS (1935) is bad because it's a western. Nothing even special. Forget this. One of my top ten least favorite shorts.
HOW HIGH IS UP (1940)- A classic. The construction scenes are hilarious. ""Where do we start?"" ""On the 97th floor."" Too many great scenes to discribe. A Must-see.",1009238400,,628,4.422413793103448
7832067,3,630280129X,"HALF-WITS HOLIDAY (1946) is a very hard short to watch. Curly, who was ill at the time, suffered another stroke during the filming of this short, and was taken to the hospital while Moe, Larry, and the crew finished filming without Curly. Curly's absense in the rest of the film is too noticeable, and it's hard to watch this knowing what happened to poor Curly. The film is a HOI POLLOI (1935), and that one is better.
HORSES' COLLARS (1935) - . An early Stooge short and I never liked this one that much because it's a Western. But Curly going wild whenever seeing a mouse, and uttering that classic line, ""Moe, Larry, the cheese"" makes this worth watching.
HOW HIGH IS UP? (1940 is a gem. Most of the short is plotless, but the boys keep it interesting with funny gags, and it gets even better in the second half when the boys are on the 97th story. Wonderful work.",994377600,,868,4.39751552795031
7832068,3,630280129X,"I hate to say this about whoever reviewed this movie and said it was ""great"", but they were incredibly wrong.  I wouldn't say this movie is bad, but I totally disagree with the opinions of that one  reviewer.  On this video there seems to be a great episode, an o.k episode,  and a horrible episode.  Here are my opinions on the 3 shorts..  ""Half-Wits Holiday"" is too hard for me to watch, and I don't know  WHERE that guy got his opinions from, saying this is one of their best.  I  would safely say this is the worst Curly episode ever made.  He is  definetly suffering during the filming of this episode, and there is  nothing funny at all about that.  Then, he suffers the stroke after Moe's  last line to him ""Now go over there, and I don't want to hear a peep  outta you.""  I guess Moe got his wish, because minutes later he had a  huge stroke, leaving Curly speech-less.  For me, this short is almost  impossible to watch.  Fans, stay away from this one, for your own good.  ""Horses Collars"" is an o.k episode, which has it's parts which  are very funny.  Me, not being a big fan of the ""western"" shorts,  thought many parts were boring.  But otherwise, some famous lines such as  ""Moe, Larry, The Cheese, The Cheese.""  It's a alltogether good  episode, just not as good as the last. ""How High Is Up?"" is truly  a classic.  That one guy said ""the weakest of the three"" (which  he was wrong about also) as it is the funniest and has the most  laugh-out-loud parts than both of the 2 before it COMBINED.  I liked this  short a lot, because the plot was funny, and interesting, and Curly did a  great job in it...even thought it was filmed in his later days.  Great  episode!
Alltogether, I have mixed feelings about this video.  It was  worth the price for ""Horses Collars"" and ""How High Is  Up?"" but I can't bring myself to allow how cruel it is to watch  ""Half-Wits-Holiday.""  Maybe people feel differently (Such as that  1 reviewer), but most Stooge fans would not enjoy that short at ALL.  Anyway, it's your call on this one...I bought it, and I like it.  My  advice...buy it, rewind the first short, then watch the last two and  laugh-out-loud for awhile.",946771200,6,2165,4.391857506361323
7832069,3,630280129X,"This is a great tape for any Three Stooges fan.  I would have to say that there are many tapes better that this one, but it is still a must for any fan.",946684800,,152,3.606060606060606
7832070,5,630280129X,"The title episode ""How high is up?"" is the weakest of the three, in my humble opinion, but still mega-funny. If you are scared of heights, this one will make your spine tremble, and that is pretty wild when you are  already laughing yourself dizzy.
Be sure to buy this one! ""Half Wits  Holiday"" is my favorite on this tape. It's their version of ""My  Fair Lady"". A professor bets his friend that environment is more  important than heredity in molding character. He bets that he can turn a  slob into a gentleman, just as three workmen come in slapping each other  and destroying the place. Their final coming out party starts out a  success, with Moe and Larry showing superb manners, and Curly getting by  with a few mild antics. Then disaster strikes, and the real slapstick  begins. It is one of their best ever - and is the last one Curly ever did,  as he suffered a stroke in 1947 during the filming of this landmark  episode.
""Horses Collars"" is one of their earliest and is a  fantastic sample of their crazy mad westerns. It's extremely funny. Some of  the fight scenes are very creative with two guys wearing half of the same  coat and slugging the good guys as often as the bad guys.",926208000,,1194,4.442396313364055
