8478353,2,B005LOBWEI,"This has been shown on the NHL Network and it's good, but paying over $20 for this with such little content is not good.

It's also really really subjective as Red Wings-Blackhawks is nowhere near as intense as Canucks-Blackhawks right now nor as boring as in the Snorris Division days. Besides the Wings-Avs rivalry the next best Wings' rivalry in their history was the '50s rivalry with the Habs in which they often met with 1st place or the Cup on the line. I'd argue the Hawks have a far more intense rivalry with the St. Louis Blues or even the old Minnesota North Stars than they ever did or do with the Red Wings.

I'd also argue leaving out the Bruins-Rangers of the early '70s is a huge miss.

Habs-Leafs is fine for the past but once the Laffs went to the Western Conference, that rivalry was done. It's been revived a bit since the Make Beliefs moved back to the Eastern Conference but playoffs make rivalries and the two have not met in the playoffs since the move.

Other than that most of these rivalries are spot on as the best of the best.
