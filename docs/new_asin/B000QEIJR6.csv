8195852,4,B000QEIJR6,"Aika has just gotten her class c salvagers license at 16 years old. She is invited by the school treasure hunting club to pilot a submarine on an adventure. Karen, one of the clubs members has a butterfly tattoo on one of her breasts. It is actually a treasure map. The club president, Eri, is determined to find what lies at the bottom of the Ocean. They go through a lot to get there, and when they do, they discover a shocking secret about Karen's past.

R-16 is better than the original Aika in every way. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all a step up. There are more panties than ever, and tons of topless teenage chicks. Despite the obvious focus on nudity, it actually has a fun, intersesting, and light hearted story. It is a 3 episode OVA and it runs about 75 minutes. I think that if you liked the original series, you'll most certainly like this one. Maybe even more. I thought the original series ran out of gas after episode 4. This one doesn't have time to drag on for an hour. It's a lot of fun with tons of eye candy.",1357257600,,1049,4.297979797979798

If you liked any of the other Aika videos then you will enjoy a little more of the err show ",1265068800,,583,3.906779661016949
8195854,1,B000QEIJR6,"I bought this DVD thinking it was a sequel to the first Aika R-16 DVD. (A show that I love and do highly recomend to any anime fan who likes action, comedy, sci-fi and loads of fanservice, by the way.)

But anyway, I bought this DVD only to discover it's a Japanese DVD. Meaning NO English translation AT ALL, and probably won't even play on an American DVD player!

Unless you have a Japanese DVD player and speak fluent Japanese, don't get ripped off like I was; don't bother.",1240876800,4,478,4.359550561797753
