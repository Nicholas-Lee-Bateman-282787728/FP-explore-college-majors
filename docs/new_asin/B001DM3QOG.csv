8294072,4,B001DM3QOG,"Familiar Britcom faces from the 70's and 80's abound in this collection of holiday-themed episodes from the vaults of London Weekend Television and Yorkshire Television.

Highlights include Arthur Lowe as a loveable and cranky Irish priest in BLESS ME FATHER; Elaine Stritch vs. Donald Sinden in the East-meets-West domestic comedy TWO'S COMPANY; Reg Varney drives a double-decker of laughs ON THE BUSES; plus Sid James' riotous suburban holiday in ALL THIS AND CHRISTMAS TOO.

Many hidden gems lurk within this DVD collection (which clocks in at over FIVE hours): A daydreaming young man's search for romance (and parental approval) in BILLY LIAR; Workplace hi-jinx as only the Brits can pull it off in THE RAG TRADE; and a pickle-factory's Christmas pantomime goes pair-shaped in NEAREST AND DEAREST.

Sure, there are a few clinkers in this set (surely there was a better episode of PLEASE, SIR! out there?), but the gold nuggets FAR outweigh the coal.

The video source material is surprising good for programmes shot (mostly) on 70's/80's videotape, with clear strong audio (but no subtitles).

Overall, VERY highly recommended for the British TV comedy fan, especially if you're looking for something other than the same-old, same-old Britcom material usually found on BBC America or PBS.",1261958400,2,1293,5.257281553398058
