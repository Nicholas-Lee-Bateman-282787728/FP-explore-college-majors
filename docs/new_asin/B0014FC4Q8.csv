It wowed the audience like only a Sunday afternoon matinee movie could do!  And even today, it still brings joy to our household.  The acting of the First Mate was very stiff and didn't flow very well, but I think that's the way the director wanted.  This was his idea of how a tough guy would act that ""Beauty"" could also put under her spell!
I saw Mothra as a young child in the late '60s  and it has captured my heart for ever!  Again, Godzilla was the menace to the world and a hero needed to be found quickly!  Hence, two miniature woman appeared to retrieve the Egg that a new Mothra would hatch from.  Of course Godzilla wanted to stop that because he wants to be the big-guy on campus!  Lo and behold, Mothra looses her strengh and dies before it could defeat Godzilla.  But, don't worry!  Two giant ""grubs"" come forth from the egg and takes care of business!  Godzilla is defeated and the two ""little"" worms swim all the way back home on the island!",1507334400,,1081,4.398989898989899
