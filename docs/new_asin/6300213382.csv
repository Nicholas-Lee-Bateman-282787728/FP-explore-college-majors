7806110,5,6300213382,"This script by sci-fi legend Theodore Sturgeon is well done. But the 5-star rating is iffy (4.5 would be more appropriate). If you could preserve one Star Trek episode for future generations, would this be the one? The main message seems to be that sexuality is a difficult subject.

The episode fills what would otherwise be a mysterious gap in Vulcan biology. The Mr. Spock we know would never fall in love (except on that planet where the spores got him). Nor do Vulcans seem interested in raising babies, who are (after all) most illogical. Why, then, don't Vulcans die out? The answer is that once every seven years, the mating urge takes control. It's not pretty. Spock acts horribly, shouting and throwing food at Nurse Chapel. For this to happen to Spock of all people is deeply disturbing. The message seems to be: for those who can't integrate love and romance into their lives, when sex finally raises its head, it's terrifying.

Spock must go to Vulcan and join with his ""wife,"" a remarkably beautiful female Vulcan (the first we ever saw I believe) named T'Pring. Their minds were joined when teenagers. Kirk and McCoy join the wedding party at Spock's request. It is touching that Spock invites McCoy, for once showing us his true estimation of the good doctor. On Vulcan, things don't go as planned; Kirk is chosen as ""champion"" to fight Spock and accepts only because he thinks he can help his friend by fighting easy.

Tension remains high. Near the end, it looks like there's no way out of absolute disaster, until the final, surprising scene. But like the Kobayashi Maru in Star Trek II, it's kind of a cheat! Overall, an emotionally involving episode. Most memorable line: ""Sometimes wanting is better than having. It is not logical, but often true."" I don't know whether that's so or not, but I think of that line often.",1189987200,,1841,4.728971962616822
7806111,5,6300213382,"In addition to being an excellent episode, this one features quite possibly the most beautiful woman to ever be in any episode of any Star Trek series. She plays J'pang (sic?), Spock's potential mate, and she is absolutely stunning! That, combined with the fact that this is just a wonderful episode all around, make this one a must own.",1172361600,,337,4.728813559322034
7806112,5,6300213382,"This is one of my very favorite episodes because it shows Spock's vulcan side along with his human side.  He becomes very irritated while on board the enterprise; not even the good ole doc can figure out what is going on.  Upon examining him, however, Mcoy finds that Spock will die unless he returns to Vulcan.

 Kirk approaches him and Spock then explains the ritual of Pon Farr , where he is supposed to take a wife.

Of course, Kirk puts his friend's priorities first and quickly takes him home.  Spock invites Mcoy and Kirk to join him for the occasion, which turns out to be a bad idea, for Spock's betrothed decides to challenge the ritual.  She chooses Kirk for her man, so Kirk must fight Spock for her.  Kirk decides to do so when Mcoy tells him that Spock probably cannot stand up to a big fight and would probably die.

  But, Kirk isn't used to the Vulcan atmosphere and begins to show signs of fatigue against Spock.  Mcoy realizes that Kirk isn't going to make it unless he intervenes.

  When Spock kills the captain, he becomes normal again and returns to the ship with the intention of turning himself in.

  This episode shows the relationship that Kirk and Spock actually has.  Never before have we seen such emotion coming from Spock!!",1151971200,,1256,4.526785714285714

7806114,5,6300213382,Easily one of the top five episodes in trek history!  If you're a fan of Nimoy's character you've gotta see this one!  Too great for words!  The whole series rocks and this is one of the very best!,1022457600,,197,4.131578947368421
7806115,5,6300213382,"The original Star Trek TV series aired from 1966-1969 and reflected the era in which it was made.  The Cold War was still raging although the threat of nuclear war had receded somewhat and a shooting war was in progress in Vietnam.  The horrors of World War 2 were still fresh in many peoples minds and even World War 1 was still a living memory for many people. Thus, many people were groping for a way for mankind to overcome the urges that seemingly pushed it to greater and greater levels of self-destruction.  The writers of Star Trek decided to create a character, Mr Spock, who would come from a world that had decided to cope with these challanges by banishing emotion.  Mr Spock's struggle with this became the theme of many episodes, especially this one and Journey to Babel.  Dr McCoy's criticism represents a critique of this approach, i.e. that man must live with his emotions and control them, not eliminate them entirely.  Even though Spock and McCoy represent very different approaches to life, they are the closest of friends, as we see in this fine episode.  People can live in peace, not by necessarily banishing all differences and living in some fuzzy, empty, middle ground, but by respecting all philosophies that search for the ultimate truths.  This is the message of the original Star Trek and is represented beautifully in this episode and this is why I am so disappointed in the subsequent TV series and movies which lost this vision.",1007078400,2,1461,4.747035573122529
7806116,5,6300213382,"The fact that there is no review applauding this episode bothers me. This is the episode that introduces us to all the Vulcan history which has become so well-known. ""Live long and prosper"", the Vulcan hand  jesture and the famous music people like Eddie Murphy and ""the Cable  Guy"" imitate are all from this episode. If you consider yourself a  Star Trek fan in the slightest then you must own this episode.",953251200,3,408,4.638888888888889
