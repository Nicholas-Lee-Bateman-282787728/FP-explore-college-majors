2792281,5,B000O78632,"Having spent most of my life in Louisiana, I can vouch for the wonderful images and authentic bayou sounds of Tab Benoit, Amanda Shaw (what an amazing young talent!), Chubby Carrier, and the other artists featured in this movie.  My heart aches for the devastion and suffering that remains in New Orleans, from Hurricane Katrina.  How compassionately and respectfully this movie shows it!  The erosion of the Louisiana coast and wetlands is a serious issue that will impact humans and wildlife far beyond the borders of the state.  Thank goodness for passionate advocates such as Tab Benoit, and others, who are trying to make a difference.  I cried, laughed, felt full of pride, felt full of despair, as I watched this movie at the OmniMax, and can't wait to own a copy when it is available.  Definitely see it at an OmniMax if you can.  Like me, you will probably want to own your own copy.  I bought the sound track at the theater, after the show.  I keep it in my car, and listen to it nearly every day.",1179532800,9,1007,4.55

I recently viewed this film at an IMAX theatre and strongly recommend this film.  The scenery and music are spectacular!  Well worth going to see at an IMAX theatre, but I will also purchase it for home viewing.  It is just that good!",1176508800,2,396,6.86

It's filmed around the home of Tab in Louisiana.  If you get a chance to see it in an Imax Theatre, it will be well worth the price of a ticket.  The fabulous sound and scenery is great to watch on the BIG screen.  I can't wait to see it again in my own home.  The wetlands and destruction of Hurricane Katrina will really move you.",1174521600,13,465,4.111111111111111

2792323,5,B000O78632,"The cinema photography is truly an IMAX production and well wrought. The music is fantastic too. Greatly, enjoyed the film.

I first saw this film at a ""TRUE"" IMAX theater and just could not wait to buy it, it is that good of a film for me to spend my money on.
This film explains the effects of physical change of the land scape and how it contributed to the greater destruction of Hurricane Katrina. The issues this film touches on are environmental changes I would have never considered being a bad thing, so it does educate the viewer.
Hurricane on the Bayou is good for ages, my opinion, from about 7 or 8 on.",1381363200,,614,4.339130434782609
2792324,4,B000O78632,My daughter and I saw this when we were in New Orleans this summer (2013). I bought it to use in my classroom. I think it is an entertaining and more personal way to show how important our wetlands are.,1376697600,,202,4.075
2792345,4,B000O78632,"Vey intersting documental. Images of devastation impressed me. Good recreations.

2792350,4,B000O78632,"Saw this at Imax theatre in New Orleans. It focuses on the impact of over-development on the delta as a contributing factor to the amount of damage caused by Katrina. It goes through the science lightly, but it conveys a great appreciation for the culture of the region, through its images and, superlatively, its music. When the movie was over, I could not wait to find the CD of the soundtrack and months later, we are still playing it over and over. Uplifting and at times somber, it is a great sampling of terrific music, especially by the great young fiddler Amanda Shaw and the soulful Delta bluesman Tab Benoit. The images of the film stick with you also.",1331424000,,662,4.571428571428571
2792351,2,B000O78632,"Dare I say, shallow; no depth.  I love NO and the bayous (wetlands), and agree that they need to be saved.  However, this seemed to be more about showcasing a 13 year old prodigy and the musicians of NO and their travails before, during and after Katrina.  I'm sure the folks of Pass Christian could tell a tale or two also.  In the aftermath of the BP oil spill, and the recent flooding of the Mississippi, I would like to see focus on the entire Gulf Coast/wetlands region; not just NO.  God bless those hearty souls who have survived and persevered through these disasters.",1309737600,,576,4.5
2792352,5,B000O78632,"My family and several friends saw this Documentary movie at the Imax in New Orleans in April 2010. It was Fantastic. It has such a personal touch to what happened there, it centers mostly on the damage and loss of the wetlands and marine and animal life. It also touches on the impact to the survivors, both animal and human. Several in our group had tears in their eyes, along with many of the other people in the theater. At the end of the movie people in the theater gave it a Standing Ovation. You will not be dis-appointed with this movie. You will want to share with your friends. Since we purchased the movie, we have viewed it several times. With the current problem with the oil slick off the Bayou, you will see how important it is to help preserve these waters.",1273363200,,772,4.368055555555555
2792353,3,B000O78632,"We saw this film at an IMAX theatre but decided we wanted to have it to play again at home.  The photography and music are great, and the story is one we need to remember.",1265587200,3,171,3.8857142857142857
2792354,5,B000O78632,"Grammy nominated cajun bluesman Tab Benoit is the perfect and authentic story teller for this documentary.  A must see for all Tab Benoit fans!  The cajun heart throb is a natural on film:  Tab  Benoit sizzles as much on the big screen as he smokes on the guitar!  The urgency of the vanishing wetlands is clearly heard through Benoit's passionate heartfelt delivery.  It's obvious that Tab knows the region well and loves it deeply.  The original cajun music featured within this film captures the soul of the Bayou.  The photography is visually stunning and punctuates the beauty of nature before with shocking aftermath visuals.  While the documentary evades the bigger unspoken political issues contributing to the worst disaster fiasco in American history, it's still worth the watch for environmental enthusiasts.  It's also a good resource film for students.  It has enough entertainment woven throughout the film to maintain the student's interest while delivering a solid historical lesson.  Be sure to watch the DVD extras which are just as interesting and informative.  Every high school and middle should own a copy of this film.",1263945600,,1141,5.169398907103825
2792355,5,B000O78632,"I really enjoyed everything in this documentary, the history and amazing story of the wetlands, Hurricane Katrina, lives of its residents and creatures, and especially the music.  I enjoyed it the second time around as much as seeing it the first time at the Audubon Nature Institute in New Orleans.",1253145600,,299,4.98
2792356,5,B000O78632,"Hurricane On The Bayou is one of the best documentaries of the decade.  It is forty minutes, and made for IMAX, which explains why some of the shots used.

The 'Making Of' portion of the DVD explains that the original movie was suppose to be ""Storm On The Bayou"" featuring Amanda Shaw, a teenage Disney actress and cajun fiddler, Tab Benoit, a blues guitarist and wetlands activist, and a mother Alligator.  But when Hurricane Katrina hit in the later stages of its production, the theme and title changed.

Rock and Roll hall of fame member Allen Toussaint, Zydeco legend Chubby Carrier, and gospel queen Martha Wright join our narrators as the film explores the relationship of climate change, levees, development of the Louisiana wetlands, and the resulting devastation from Hurricane Katrina.

The story is told through the narration of Amanda, Tab, Meryl Streep, and Allen Toissaint.  The musicians give a diverse angle to this history, humanizing the struggle of the Louisiana Wetlands and the destruction New Orleans.

This is meant to be a respectful family film, so none of the graffic sites, such as dead bodies are shown.  Even Amanda Shaw's experience is kept dignified. As she deals with her house and school destroyed, and the uncertain fate of her grandparents, we are never shown her loosing her composure.

The music becomes a powerful narration tool, as the soundtrack hits all the styles of the Delta, the Wetlands, and New Orleans.  The film is suppose to be about climate change, weather, and the environment of the Louisiana wet-lands.  But the music and the musicians bring a soul to New Orleans, and the Bayou, that is missing from so many hurricane documentaries.  This films works as a companion piece for Spike Lee's When The Levees Broke.  This is for the family.  That is for the adults.",1242950400,5,1816,4.911475409836066
2792357,1,B000O78632,"This documentary was a flash in the pan.  It seemed as if it were produced on the fly, with little planning or direction.  Left me angry that I spent $3.99 to rent such a brief, superficial documentary that could have been really good.  I'm trying to think of something good to say about it....",1240617600,3,294,4.407407407407407
2792358,5,B000O78632,"I went in 2004 and was planning to go back, but didn't make it,to New Orleans in 2005 (The Katrina year).  After I saw the devastation that happened, I started feeling close to this part of the world.  This year will be my 4th time back to New Orleans since.  I've come to love this city and the surrounding areas.  Watching this movie at the IMAX in New Orleans was an emotional experience.  Yes, it's somewhat about the dying wetlands and not totally about Hurricane Katrina, but the story involves both.  I enjoyed the scenery, the story and the sadness.  I actually cried twice while watching the movie.  Being born and raised in Southern California, I didn't know much about the South personally.  Now I think about New Orleans all the time and feel like I need to go back.  I now go when I can and have donated to some of the rebuilding efforts.  This movie is a must see and I hope you love it as much as the reviewers here.",1233273600,,931,4.323699421965318

2792360,4,B000O78632,"Or rather Hurrikan ber Louisiana, since we saw it in German in the IMAX at the Technik Museum in Speyer, so no Meryl Streep narrating.

It shows the effect of Hurricane Katrina through the eyes of young musician Amanda Shaw, and talks a bit about the importance of wetlands, what could have been done to prevent a lot of the devastation, and what can be done to help the wetlands recover.

Despite its short length, I was in tears several times, and it made me think of my friends who were directly affected.

Gorgeous photography, of course, which is what you expect in an IMAX movie.",1227312000,,585,4.5
2792361,5,B000O78632,"I highly reccomend EVERYONE to watch this DVD, especially all educators! It is a wonderful teaching tool that I've used numerous times. It keeps the kids attention until the end.",1226880000,,178,4.966666666666667
2792362,5,B000O78632,"On a recent (first) trip to New Orleans, we found our feet tired and hot from all the walking.  A quick trip into the Imax Theatre, really, to cool off and rest.  Boy, what a happy accident.  This film taught us alot and in an amazingly entertaining way.  It was informative but never dull or preachy.  It was joyous, sad, cute, funny, inspiring.  As others have said, we loved it enough to buy the DVD AND the soundtrack.  We are new fans of Cajun and Blues, Gospel and Soul.  You can't not like this music.  And the movie is well worth it.  If you want to understand just a tiny part of the why's and what's of Katrina, this will help and probably make you thirst for more knowledge.  That is exactly what happened to us.
Great job.",1225929600,,734,4.246376811594203
2792363,1,B000O78632,"I thought it might be a ""history"" type of presentation. What the effects of the Hurricane was on the coasts - it was simply a diatribe on how everyone in NOLA suffered and how the government failed. VERY baised.",1221696000,2,211,4.435897435897436
2792364,1,B000O78632,"What a disappointing story! This video has an agenda, and it is NOT the story of Katrina. It is the story of saving the wetlands. That is important, but I didn't buy this video to watch the agenda. I wanted a story about the hurricane and its devastations.",1217721600,3,256,4.354166666666667
2792375,5,B000O78632,"This is a fantastic insight into the global warming issue. It really opened my eyes. Not only is this educational, it is very entertaining.

2792377,5,B000O78632,"I saw this powerful IMax film in New Orleans with it's target audience. It was a great experience. I am getting the DVD as a souvenir of the experience.

I have heard a criticism that the films goes light (or 'lite', if you will) on scientific information. Once again look at the target audience...it is well defined INTRO of different subjects: the bayou and NOLA culture pre-K, the science of the storm and the bayou and NOLA AFTER the storm. For the amount of time an IMAX film has, it does a great job.

I do recommend seeing it in IMAX first if possible...especially in New Orleans. You will definately want a copy of it after you see it that way.",1197590400,4,652,4.380165289256198

She is the person planting trees with middle school students to help restore and save the WETLANDS.",1190505600,6,399,4.642857142857143

It's stunningly filmed, and due to the timing of production, gives an extremely compelling and authentic perspective of the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Katrina. Originally, the film was just meant to educate on the ways in which the loss of wetlands and other coastal habitats make human settlements more vulnerable to severe storms. Then, part way through filming, an actual hurricane hit, giving us the opportunity to glimpse into these people's genuine reactions, rather than an after-the-fact reconstruction of events. It's disturbing and difficult to watch at times, but also a really important message: we need to protect our environmental resources.",1499040000,,834,5.423076923076923
