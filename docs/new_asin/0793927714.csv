160041,4,0793927714,"Overall I think this was a great film about race relations in the 50's. But it was a bit misleading for the caption to say "".....scandal, interracial love affair, steamy, blah, blah,...."" when there wasn't even one little on-screen kiss. I understand it was 1957 but really if you are going to be controversial, then at least do something a little racy. This movie could have been PG-13, when it should have been R.

Very forward for its time and not a bad movie. Interesting to watch to see the attitudes of the day. some good performances by Stephen Boyd and Dorothy Dandridge. the rest seemed to be forcing it, but it was 1957. The overacting comes from Joan Fontaine and Harry Belafonte. There was a very good performance by one of my not to favorite actresses too, Joan Collins. The scenery is beautiful it takes place on a tropical island called Santa Marta. The music is calypso and it great to listen to also. Daring for its time but could seem dated to most but it is worth seeing. There are some questions about a family's lineage, too.",1406505600,2,766,4.598540145985401

160077,5,0793927714,"Island in the Sun was released on June 12, 1957 to mixed critical reviews and entered the midst of strong controversy, particularly surrounding its interracial love stories. It was, however, a major box office success, becoming the year's sixth highest-grossing film. The melodrama, in many ways a good old-fashioned movie soap opera of sorts, was based on the 1955 Alec Waugh novel, which too had sharp controversy despite high sales. Island in the Sun features an ensemble cast of some of Hollywood's greatest performers, including James Mason, Harry Belafonte, Joan Fontaine, Joan Collins, Dorothy Dandridge, Stephen Boyd, Michael Rennie, John Justin, Patricia Owens, Diana Wynyard, and Basil Sydney. The title song, performed by Harry Belafonte, was also a success.

The film follows the lives of multiple characters of different races: white, black, and mixed. Maxwell Fleury (James Mason), a hot-tempered plantation owner, is married to the younger and seemingly disloyal Sylvia (Patricia Owens). His sister, Jocelyn (Joan Collins), sparks interest in a Oxford-bound Euan Templeton (Stephen Boyd), while his parents (Diana Wynyard and Basil Sydney) are hiding a deep family secret. David Boyeur (Harry Belafonte), an ambitious black labor leader, falls for Mavis Norman (Joan Fontaine), a rich white woman. Meanwhile, governor's aide Dennis Archer (John Justin) romances the beautiful Indian shop girl, Margot Seaton (Dorothy Dandridge). The main drive of melodrama is the rocky marriage of Maxwell and Sylvia, and Maxwell's suspecting his wife of having an affair with the older Hilary Carson (Michael Rennie), a war hero. The drama surrounding Hilary's death and the subsequent trail and suspense is very entertaining.

Island in the Sun often generates negative reviews, but it is, contrary to myth, an exceptional motion picture. It is perhaps one of the best film adaptations of a novel ever produced for the film screen. It is far more entertaining than the majority of the so-called ""Classics"" and is worthy for viewing multiple times. The bright and beautiful scenery coped with the strong performances makes this film a definite pleasure to watch.",1398470400,,2162,5.431547619047619

160081,5,0793927714,"Besides a star studded cast and great setting, this story also offers an interesting take on the rise of grassroot political consciousness by native populations against the colonial values of the 18th and 19th centuries. James Mason is at his best here and the depth of his character's cold detachment from any sense of morality is as good as ""Lolita"". Harry Belafonte is powerful like Putin and sets the political tone required to provide tension for the plot line. Also, for real film buffs there is a tribute to ""Dial M for Murder"" built in and the great actor John Williams reprising his role as the droll police inspector.",1393545600,,627,4.761467889908257

And, who can tell God to mate whom with whom.  It should not be about trying to prove a point by ones history.  It should not come out of anger, greed, jealousy or envy.

While the book it was based on is a definite accusation of the old system which held the peasants poor and the landowners rich. The 'revolution' in the Windward Islands left the peasants still mostly poor but the politicians got rich.

160107,4,0793927714,"When this film was released in 1957, it was controversial because of the inter-racial relationships on a British colonial island, Santa Marta, a fictional place. The island looks beautiful with the cinematography. The film deserves high marks for the colorful art direction, costumes, and atmosphere. The film also has an all-star cast like Harry Belafonte, Dorothy Dandridge (in a supporting role), a young Joan Collins, Joan Fontaine, the fabulous Diana Wynyard, James Mason, and others in the cast.

The film's writing might need to have been improved but the engagement among the actors is worth watching. It's a bit of soap opera with four couples and their relationship on the island. The standout performance for me was seeing Diana Wynyard, a British veteran actress, play Mrs. Fleury.

Granted, the film's writing might have been because of the inter-racial relations between the wealthy whites who dominated the island and the thousands of blacks who live and work for them at times.

The DVD is first rate even though I wanted French subtitles at times. The film is widescreen and simply stunning to watch even now over 50 years later.

There are extras like the trailer but mostly the A&E complete episode on Biography about Dorothy Dandridge in the film. Instead of showing just a clip about her role in the film, the DVD shows an excellent episode from 1998 featuring Dorothy's biographer, former sister-in-law Geraldine Banton, former husband Harold Nicholas, former brother-in-law Alwayn Nicholas, co-stars Diahann Carroll and Nichelle Nichols.

There is also Halle Berry who played her in the HBO film biography where she earned accolades for her performance and would be the first African American female actress to win Best Actress in a Leading Role in a Film Academy Award. It's ironic since Dorothy Dandridge was the first African American woman to get nominated in the category and lose to Grace Kelly.  But Diahann Carroll, her co-star in the film, Carmen Jones, noted that the nomination itself was an honor even though she lost. She was in the same category as Grace Kelly, Jane Wyman, and Judy Garland. It's ironic that Judy Garland never got over losing to Grace Kelly for her performance in the film, ""A Star is Born.""",1357516800,,2246,5.040431266846361

160112,5,0793927714,"I had long wanted to see this movie -- but somehow, never got
around to it till just this last week, when it was showing on
cable-TV.  (Upon seening the very last scene, I remembered I
had seen just that -- ONLY the very last scene -- a few years
back....)

But this time, I saw the entire movie all the way through. It
might be construed by some as ""not politically correct"" -- and
so it would not be -- NOW.  However, for the time in which it
was made, (release date: 1957), it was very ""avant guarde""! It
is, I think, a movie which should be seen today by EVERYONE --
older people, to reflect upon just how much, (if at all) their
own attitudes towrds race and race relations have changed. And
younger people, too -- to see, ""how it was then"", in an engros-
sing, involving film, and also, to understand the views of
their own older friends and relations, (black and white, both),
and the situations and attitudes which, though not exactly
the same, still were pervasive at the time this movie was made,
and before then.

JAMES MASON plays a plantion-0wner, and son of a plantation-
owner.  JOAN COLLINS, (younger, and even more beautiful than
ever she was on ""DALLAS""), plays his sister.  They are part of a
very small, very rich minority on a tropical island paradise,
ruled as a British colony. MICHAEL RENNIE is a member of an
exclusive, ""Whites-Only"" social club, to which James Mason's
character, and his father, belong.  A friend of their's is
played by JOAN FONTAINE.  HARRY BELAFONTE plays a rising young
black politician on the island -- a rarity in those days. Al-
though he is obviously better-educated, (an education earned
not just though hard studying, but by hard work to pay for
that education), and speaks English with greater ease and
vocabulary than most of the other black people in the movie,
you can tell he has definitely NOT forgotten his roots.  He
has obviously educated himself not only to help himself get
up in the world -- but to bring up all the other black peole
in the island to a better standard of living, and to get more equality for them all. DOROTHY DANDRIDGE plays a lovely civil-
ian army secretary.  And STEPHEN BOYD is a titled Englishman,
living with his father on their own plantation.

Joan Collins' and Stephen Boyd's characters soon begin to fall
in love.  As do Dorothy Dandridge's character and a handsome,
(white) soldier.  Joan Fontaine's character seems to have great admiration, and perhaps love, too, for Harry Belafonte's character.
.
Trouble ensues when it is revealed that Mr. Fleury, Sr., (James
Mason's and Joan Collin's character's father), has a black
person as an ancestor (!)  The black person involved was his
grandmother -- who herself had both black AND white ancestry.
This makes Mr. Fleury, Sr. 1/16 black.  But Joan Collins's
character is crest-fallen -- even though Stephen Boyd's
character says he loves her and wants to marry her, and even
Stephen Boyd's character's FATHER Ok's the wedding, Joan
Collins' character, (Ms. Fleury), cannot go through with it.
She imagines herself having black children, and how she, and
they, would be discriminated against in England.  Though
she still loves Stephen Boyd's titled Englishman character,
she just cannot allow herself to go through with a marriage
to him.

Worse still happens when Jame's Mason's character is insulted
by Michael Rennie's character at the club.  Hopefully, I am
not giving too much away, when I mention that an altercation
between the two of them leads to a police investigation, head-
ed by JOHN WILLIAMS, (who, in another film, plays AUDREY
HEPBURN's chauffeur father in ""Sabrina"", amongst many other
roles...)

How these tangled love affairs and the police investigation
proceed, fill up the remaining, exciting and engrossing scenes
of this film.  Which couples will marry, and which will not?
And -- is Joan Collins' characters' mother telling the truth,
when she reveals her ""secret""?

Happily or unhappily, each of the inter-twining love-stories
and the police investigation, reach a conclusion at the end.
Whether one agrees with all the outcomes or not, the viewer
must admit this is a well-done and engrossing movie, showing
attitudes as they were, when the movie was made....

...................................................

At the very end of this movie, my mind went to another movie,
mentioning ""the sun"": RAISIN IN THE SUN.  In that movie, the
metaphor of the title told of a normal mostly loving
family, whose lives were always overshadowed by a tiny ""raisin""
in the sun -- because they happened to be black.  In the
movie here being reviewed, one wonders if its title ""ISLAND
IN THE SUN"", has a double-meaning, as well.  Does racism
cut you off from much of the world that you might be enjoying?
Are you a lonely, ""Island in the Sun""?

This is still a most relevant movie!

Leading the story is David Boyeur (HarryBelafonte), a homegrown revolutionary, whose skin is his country... But the issue here is not just one of color... The issue here is who is really best fit to represent the people in the colorful island? Who knows them the best? Who feels for them the most? Who's really a part of them? On the other hand, one of the other important fights, for Boyeur, is against tradition as Santa Marta shackles with traditions...

Sizzling around the edges is Mavis Norman (Joan Fontaine) who happens to be in love with this charismatic leader... Mavis Norman feels that he is superior to most men...

As a public figure, there is Maxwell Fleury (James Mason) who seeks the election to revenge himself upon the whites whom he now thinks despise him... Fleury is ready to use the black people so that he can still rule in that world that he still belongs to...

Delving into his personal life, we see him jealous of Hilary Carson (Michael Rennie), the gentlemanly English drifter... Fleury envies him because he thinks that his wife (Patricia Owens) is attracted to him... Blind by love, he thinks that his wife had fall in love with Carson who is better suited to her...

There is also Euan Templeton (Stephen Boyd), the governor's son, who wants to be married before he goes back to England...

And let us not forget the police inspector John Williams--in a really outstanding performance--who easily identifies an unpremeditated murder... Colonel Whittingham considers the murderer not strong enough to bear the burden of his guilt... But to tell you more would be to reveal too much too soon...

This movie deals with two inter-racial romances and was quite controversial in 1957.  It tried to be daring and ground-breaking, but any semblance of inter-racial affection was censored out, resulting in a shallow, uninvolving melodrama.  It moves too quickly from couple to couple in order to serve the large cast, and the result is that none of the plot lines is developed and all are fairly incoherent.  Mason overacts but at least is interesting and Dandridge is beautiful, but Fontaine is totally miscast and Belafonte remains an enigma.

160116,5,0793927714,"A Review of Island in the Sun

By: Noran L. Moffett

In an era for which the racial hegemony was challenged by the liberation struggles of the formerly enslaved Africans, the complex circumstances of life, love and legalities were centrifugal in the movie.

In the initial scenes of the movie, the primary characters surfaced on the screen with tacit commentary and documented tension over social, political and economic life forces, love choices and legal limits.

For the viewer of Island in the Sun, the social dynamics of racial taboos over love choices were confounding the characters who were engaged in legal and social polemics. Yet, the movie rapidly explores the dynamic political leadership of the African and Multiracial majority against the established socially, politically and economically powerful European minority.

The movie ends with the emergence of the true love for the political realities facing the Afro Caribbean population by the Afro Caribbean leader (played by Harry Belafonte) over the obvious passion for him by the Euro Caribbean woman. As a result of the movies multifaceted mood, tenor and tone, the viewer can recognize historical evolution and the introduction of interracial romantic revolution.",1163116800,4,1232,5.395833333333333
160137,3,0793927714,"Interracial romance is just one of the topics covered in ""Island in the Sun"", a Darryl Zanuck production,directed by Robert Rossen(The Hustler).Politics and political crime are also covered,especially those areas that touch the Fleury family of James Mason,in a so-so performance. The REAL star of this film is the utterly fantastic Dorothy Dandridge,who sizzles EVERY moment she is on screen! The rest of the cast Stephen Boyd,Joan Collins, and Michael Rennie is just average. The ""other"" interracial romance between John Fontaine and Harry Belafonte is a bore. Included in the DVD is at he original theatrical trailer,a fine documentary from A&E concerning Dorothy,and a poor commentary,on the film, by John Stanley,who is listed as a film historian.",1147392000,3,752,5.435897435897436
160138,2,0793927714,"Set on a fictional West Indian island under British rule, Island in the Sun has all the elements to be a great 1950s soap opera: exotic locations, all-star cast, jealousy, angst-ridden male protagonists, racial tensions, sex, interracial desires, political intrigue, murder.  What a great movie someone like Douglas Sirk (Written on the Wind, the 1959 Imitation of Life) would have made with the same cast, location and storylines!

Unfortunately, producer Zanuck and director Rossen spend more time showing off the West Indian locations than developing the characters and speeding the pace so that we can keep up with the different storylines.  By the time you get back to some of the characters, youve lost interest or forgotten what happened the last time we saw them.  Of the all-star cast, only James Mason (as the angst-ridden male) and Harry Belafonte (as the angry black man) get to have showy scenes and make an impression.  Joan Fontaine (as a wealthy woman who falls for Belafonte) and Dorothy Dandridge (as a sassy West Indian who falls for a white man) are criminally wasted in this film.  Even though their storylines got the most publicity (the interracial romances) when the film was released, all the two actresses are made to do is look good (which they do) in their costumes.  Joan Collins is just okay as James Mason's sister and Diana Wynyard has one good scene as their mother.

Overall, the most interesting aspect of the movie, and the only reason worth watching it nowadays, is the 1950s Hollywood depiction of interracial romance, although there were so many compromises made that none of the two couples really seem to have much sexual chemistry or desire for each other.

The film's Cinemascope location shots look great on the DVD transfer and the DVD also features the Biography episode on Dorothy Dandridge. (I skipped the commentary track.)",1143244800,14,1872,4.993569131832797
160139,3,0793927714,"I remember seeing this movie years ago when it was released. I was a child and I had not seen it since. I was quite surprised to find out that it had been released on DVD so I ordered it. When I saw it in the theatre as a child, it seemed larger than life with the palm trees, vibrant colors, etc. I also fell in love with Dorothy Dandridge who I thought was absolutely beautiful.

Looking at this movie now, it seems rather bland and it did not hold my interest. There are a lot of story lines going on in the movie and none of them are particularly exciting. The women looked beautiful (except for Joan Fontaine who seemed quite plain and devoid of any personality) but their characters did not contribute much to the story lines.

The theme of race relations was not really explored the way I thought it would be, except as an undercurrent. The only black person in the movie to address the issue was Harry Belafonte and who does he wind up with but the ever-exciting Joan Fontaine. At the end he basically tells her to get lost.

I compare this movie with one of my all-time favorites, ""Black Orpheus"" which, while not having a complicated plot, was extremely well done.

In conclusion, while I would recommend this movie for historical reasons and for the boldness (at the time) of addressing the race issue, I would caution that it is not very interesting or exciting.",1142812800,6,1374,4.440476190476191
160140,3,0793927714,"This movie exemplifies the racial paranoia of the 1950's.  Dandridge and her white lover were even not allowed to kiss in their romantic scenes. In fact, John Justin could say ""in love"" (not ""I love you"") only after persistent pressure from Dandridge, who looks totally lost in the summer cottage after he professes his love.  In an awkward moment of indecision Dorothy quickly puts on a record then abruptly brushes her cheek against his face when they should be kissing hard.

Dandridge was very angry because her character had not been developed beyond the ""cute dumb chick"" roles she was trying to avoid, according to Donald Bogle's bio.

The older matronly Fontaine and fiery young Belafonte are totally mismatched. Instead of acually touching they just stand around looking thoroughly confused and misdirected.

Collins' ""black blood"" dilemna is laughable (pure soap), but at least she is allowed to kiss (and screw!) her husband to be.

Only Mason gives a believable - and exceptional - performance.

This film is racist Hollywood at its best, trying to be daring, but utterly failing.

I saw ""Island in the Sun"" when it was released in 1957 and bought this video only because it offers one of few opportunties to see the ravishing Dandridge perform during an era when Hollywood had no place for a dramatic Black actress.",1140480000,13,1328,4.95045045045045
160141,5,0793927714,"The movie was ahead of its time.  What Ms. Dorothy Dandridge achieved in the making of this film is extraordinary, considering that during the making of this musical Hollywood only had a handful of black performers, and most were subjected to play minor, subservient roles.  For a short while, at a time when Hollywood was run by white men, she was the feminine version of Sidney Poitier.  Had she been a man, she could have reached the heights Mr. Poitier reached. Good talent, Good dancer, beautiful face.",1122422400,6,507,4.804597701149425
160142,4,0793927714,"I don't want to rehash what the other reviewers have all said about the beautiful scenery and the plot.  I just want to touch on a few things that I felt touched me personally.
""The Color Problem"" was the theme of the newspaper article that revealed the ""Negro"" ancestry of plantation owner Maxwell Fleury(James Mason) who was the political rival of David Boyeur(Harry Belafonte).I gave the film 4 stars for the bravery they exibited in broaching the subject in 1957.  This was filmed in the heat of the civil rights movement, Dr. Martin L. King was just getting started. I agree with ""Red lips Raven hair"" though that with trying to address so many themes they wound up not giving either the depth it deserved. Ferris State University's ""Jim Crow Musem"" (...)Lists this film as being the first to display a Black woman(Dorothy Dandridge) being held--lovingly-- in the arms of a White man in an American movie. Her character was also afforded the ability to fall in love and to leave the island with White man on a love plane to England where they would live happily ever after.  Meanwhile Harry Belafonte's character was forced to deny the love that had developed between him and yond white woman(Joan Fontaine) in order to be a respected leader of the island people. Although dating apparently caused no problems. ""If I married you my people would feel I betrayed them"".  In actually I think this is the only ending that Hollywood could swallow at the time.

The thing that gets me though is almost fifty years later things are not much different, albeit in many ways interracial relationships are at least tolerated by both races, but still not equal to same race marriages.  As a Black male who has dated white women I can attest to the alienated treatment received by some from both races.  Some of the same People who embrace and give their blessings to interracial relationships where the woman is Black, scorn the relationships with Black men.  This 2005 attitude parallels this 1957 film.

I eventually married a Beautiful Black woman who I love and adore.  Though I must admitt that I was very disappointed in myself for not having the guts and internal fortitude to fight the social pressures and stand up for the beautiful love I had before her with a woman who happened to be White.

My hat's off to these brave actors and film makers for approaching such a radical subject for its time.  I also applaud all the interratial couples out there who are genuinely in love.  Inspite the social pressures they are giving their love a chance.  Bravo and God Bless you.  If no one else is happy for you remember that I am.  Hopefully in time this will be a non-issue.",1121817600,10,2672,4.677350427350428
160143,3,0793927714,"This was a very unique movie for Hollywood in the 1950s because it explored interracial relationships from both a political as well as romantic perspective. No doubt, it made audiences extremely uncomfortable.

The cast is very strong (with Dorothy Dandridge, Joan Fontaine, John Williams and James Mason--who never disappoints,) and the storyline both intriguing and unpredictable. Harry Belafonte portrays a proud, outspoken labor leader who fights racial injustice on a British Caribbean island, but this is only a secondary plot line. The ""forbidden fruit"" of interracial relationships is explored from several different perspectives, giving this movie an important place in the history of American Cinema. Although racism and class-ism are common elements, the characters are empathetically portrayed. This movie was released in Jim Crow America and, younger viewers may not fully appreciate its' unique portrayal of Blacks in non-subservient roles. Blacks were typically cast as inarticulate maids and butlers, but Dorothy Dandridge (nominated as Best Actress for Carmen Jones in 1954) and Harry Belafonte (a top ten pop singer) were particularly stunning and sophisticated, an anomaly for Black actors in films roles at the time. Nevertheless, Belafonte's acting is often stilted, revealing that this was an early role while Dandridge's character lacks depth--though her acting superb, given that she has been given so little with which to work.

An important side note is that Harry Belafonte was a top-selling West Indian Calyso singer (Day-0-The Banana Boat Song) at the time that this movie was released and performed the title song. In addition to making a strong political statement about the need for racial justice--via his character in this film--he also was a high-profile figure within the Civil Rights Movement, marching with the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King.",1114819200,6,1884,5.560975609756097
160144,4,0793927714,"After many years of trying to finally catch this one on ""the telly"", I recently was afforded the opportunity. As a ""period piece"" and ""social commentary"", the film works fairly well. One most realize that miscegenation was still a taboo in the 50's when this film was made; thus, it was considered a violation of ""the natural order of things"" in much of the Deep South. While the ""romance"" between Dorothy Dandridge (""Margot Seaton"") and John Justin (""David Archer"") was displayed, all that Harry Belafonte (""David Boyeur"") and Joan Fontaine (""Mavis Norman"") could muster were some occasional glances and a verbal exchange about the pros and cons of interracial relations.
In light of the controversy surrounding the recent ""Monster's Ball"", we may not have matured as much as we think.
Many of the other roles are filled by those that were under contract to Twentieth Century-Fox, the releasing company: Joan Collins (Jocelyn Fluery""), previously seen in ""Land of the Pharoahs"", Michael Rennie (""Hilary Carson""), earlier featured in ""The Robe"" and the classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", and Patricia Owens (""Sylvia Fluery"")from""The Fly"".
Even James Mason (""Maxwell Fluery"") had been featured in the Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz vehicle for Fox ""Forever, Darling"".
Future ""Ben-Hur"" villain Stephen Boyd (""Euan Templeton"") is on hand as the romantic interest for Collins.
While the acting is equal to the talented cast, it is character veteran John Williams that steals the show. As ""Colonel Whittingham"", the police investigator of a character's demise, he seems as a precursor to television's ""Columbo"". Crafty, witty, and verbally adept, his ""flatfoot"" is not one's typical cop.
In all, the film is enjoyable, not only for the performances but for the lush scenery and the glimpse at how movies ""dared"" to do something different in the 50's.",1027987200,30,1844,5.212121212121212
160145,5,0793927714,"""Island in the Sun"" is a beautiful film  that was partially filmed in Barbados. It includes scenes of the sugar mill where my mother played as a child, which is now owned by my aunt, Shirley King, who, at present, is Secretary to the country's Prime Minister, Owen Arthur, and it gives the viewer a splendid shot of the beach where my parents walked with my older sister and me when I was a toddler.
 The interracial romances may have raised a few eyebrows at the time, and I am all too familiar with life in the state that banned this film upon its original release. The majority of Americans probably couldn't relate to an educated Black populace
 struggling for its independance, or shouting down the orations of a white politician they didn't trust, as was played by James Mason. But the charismatic character, David, played by a strapping Harry Belafonte, is typical of many Blacks in the Carribean. What Americans often fail to appreciate is the fact that the slaves of the Carribean were freed and educated sooner than they were in the United States, and that few who understand the culture of most Carribean Islands would bat an eyelash at the thought of their being in positions of leadership. This film was made to entertain an America that still had a long way to as far as improvement in race relations was concerned. Consequently, Dorothy Dandridge's Margot could not kiss her White lover.
 But in showing the corruption of the White establishment, exemplified by Joan Collins, James Mason, et. al, we see the justification for the fight for the full citizenship of the Blacks of the island. Joan Fontaine is Harry Belafonte's love interest who is sympathetic to his plight, but still condescending towards the people he represents. Ultimately David sacrifices their relationship to appease those who would consider him a sell-out if he married a White woman while fighting on behalf of Blacks. Dorothy Dandridge, who is free of similar preasures, although not free of criticism, marries the man she loves.
 This is a terrific presentation, filled with beautiful tropical scenery, and multiple tales about jealousy, murder,bigotry, scandalous behavior, sacrifice, of the rising status of some, and the declining status of others. It is also a tale of finding one's proper place in life, and remaining true to oneself.--A great movie! One of the best of 1957!",1004745600,21,2371,4.9175
160146,5,0793927714,"Island in the Sun makes you wish you where on the that Island.

7792774,4,0793927714,"A good movie for viewing Hollywood attitudes about inter-racial relationships in the 1950s. No on-camera kissing allowed between black and white actors in those days. In this film, two white characters were allowed to show natural affection towards each other. A white male could show affection towards a non-white woman, but not as much as two white characters. And although there was a romantic attraction between Harry Belafonte's and Joan Fontaine's characters, no physical displays of affection were allowed. Contrast this with today's movies and the differences are huge. Also, colonialist power relationships are clearly evident throughout this movie with the British firmly in control and black people in subservient positions. Overall, this is a good movie, nice settings, and well-acted. I enjoyed it, while being aware of the attitudes of the 1950s.",1519948800,,860,5.473684210526316

The recently decolonized world of the late 1950's is very far away from today and this film (made at the time) gives you a window into that time and place.  The issues involved remind us of how far the people in this film are from a modern mindset (It's a major plot point that someone who is visibly white is 1/32nd black and how that means they can't marry someone else).  It's not that the issues it tackles are gone, but the underlying assumptions of the characters are often blatant where as in the modern era they would be more covert.
