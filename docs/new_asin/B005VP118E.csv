4897309,3,B005VP118E,"This DVD set contains 5 or 6 separate ""shows"" by Dr. F. I think that the presentation is too technical for most people. He refers to many medical and nutritional terms that the viewer can get lost in trying to keep track of. I just listened to one of his books on a 5-CD set and found that much more ""digestible"".

That said, if you want to save your life - and about $350K (what the latest study as of 11/12 says people in retirement will spend on healthcare costs!) - buy his books, cds, or whatever you can, and educate yourself to live a long and healthy life!",1354579200,50,564,4.174311926605505

4897315,5,B005VP118E,"Joel Fuhrman has changed the way I eat and think of food.  I haven't been sick since reading his first book.  If other doctors would promote healthy eating as the first cure to certain (preventable) diseases instead of pills, healthcare would look very different in this country.  I recommend this to everyone!  I have bought his book Super Immunity about 10 times and have passed it to family and loved ones with health issues.  I'm buying this DVD set for my brother, who just had his thyroid removed with a tumor attached.  He's in his early 50s and is taking at least 5 meds a day.  To Better Health!!  Thank you Dr. Joel Fuhrman.",1419033600,7,634,4.5
4897316,4,B005VP118E,"A great collection of inspiring lectures and the price is good.

I was disappointed to discover the DVD's come in individual paper sleeves in a fairly cheap carboard cover instead of in a proper DVD box. I stuck them in my own DVD box and cut the original ""box"" into pieces which serve as cover, back, and spine.",1418169600,2,312,4.379310344827586

4897320,5,B005VP118E,"I listened to these DVDs and have learned so much.  I have several of the health conditions his dvds speak of - diabetes, arrhythmia, eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, obesity, high triglycerides, metabolic syndrome.  What a brilliant man, a nutritionist that wants to help the patient end the disease instead of just treating it, managing it.  I haven't yet put his guidelines into full practice, but I'm on my way.  I learned so much in every one of these DVDs.  Watch them all, you'll miss important points made if you only listen to one.  After watching a friend's set, I bought a set for myself and a set for my parents.  I strongly encourage everyone to watch these videos.",1402358400,15,676,4.726495726495727

4897326,5,B005VP118E,"I didn't touch fruits or vegetables until I was 32 years old.  I saw this and his ""Immunity Solution"" programs on PBS and they finally gave me the motivation to try healthy foods.  Less than a year later I now eat raw vegan (except I cook beans & quinoa) because of him.  Cooking and freezing damage some nutrients, so I eat raw.  Dr Fuhrman explains in simple detail what nutrients are in certain foods, what each food does for the body and why they are a necessity.  I finally realized that cereals, breads, tv dinners, pizzas, etc are not food, they are filler.  They are fortified with vitamins because they are not food.  And fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, & seeds have hundreds of un-named required nutrients that aren't in supplements or fortified foods.
I work out every day and was only 150lbs but was inflamed/bloated and I have lost that now, I'm down to 130lbs and I have veins that go from my abs up to my pecs, I love it.  I'm 33 and look & feel better than I did at 18.
I've also seen Dr Fuhrman on The Doctor Oz Show.  He speaks slowly, and repeats some things so they are easier to understand and remember.  These ideas become familiar and so they are much easier to become habit.
I showed the ""Immunity Solution"" video to my friend because she wanted help changing, and she has lost 35lbs in 2 months.  More importantly, she will be healthy & won't have polyps and gastritis and colonic spasms and hernias anymore",1375747200,39,1433,4.452107279693487
