3100784,1,B0012Z36BM,"The only thing good i can say is.....well, it's only 40 minutes long, so you don't have to endure that long.  The premise and the title really make it sound like it's going to be a fun low budget zomedy....uh, no.  For a low budget zomedy, try Hide and Creep, Strippers Vs. Zombies, Bong of the Dead, Dead and Breakfast.  Since it is so short, this movie I suppose is maybe worth watching with friends just so all of you can make your OWN jokes about it to laugh at, and afterwards you can all say ""i can't beleive we just watched that stupid $(%*$! The effects are horrible and repetitive, the acting....what acting?, the jokes....what jokes?  Bad dialogue, bad everything....and not a ""so bad it's good"" situation.  Yes, you get to see a stoner eat a cop, and two lesbians eat each other, but both of the scenes were just boring.  This movie is as bad as Redneck Zombies....so if you DID like Redneck Zombies, maybe this is your cup of tea.",1410912000,,942,4.416184971098266

3100786,3,B0012Z36BM,"Okay, you don't have to be a rock scientist to guess this is a stupid low budget zombie marijuana flick.  But this Troma offering does have some clever...uhhm, ...some smart...like...uhh...what's the word?  oh! (lightbulb flash) Techniques!, that are cool and stuff.

A townfull of rednecks constantly smoke some weed (duh!).  But this batch of the green stuff isn't filling then with feelings of peace, love, and happiness.  Quite the opposite in fact.  It turns their skin green and gives them a voracious(google it?) appetite for human flesh.

I love the idea for this twist to the zombie genre.  It doesn't necessarily make alot of sense, but the expected fan base probably won't mind.

Right from the beginning there is a disclaimer that states that the pot smoked in this film is not real (whatever).  I guess this stuff somehow got laced with some radioactive herb.  Most of POT ZOMBIES is nothing more than potheads smoking, turning into zombies, and eating people.

But the filmmakers try to get creative with the effects.  At times there are flashing psychedelic lights in the background.  Cartoon figures bounce on the screen.  There are also news flashes that cut in and interrupt the flow.  It does try to be unique.  Additionally, there is a brief scene of nudity.  Plus the kills aren't too shabby for such a low-budget production.

But the efforts do eventually get a tad tiresome, due to the fact there are no attempts at character development.  Some more dialogue between the potheads would have been helpful.  It doesn't even need to be clever, some stoners arguing over the best flavor of Doritos or something.  Anything!  Oh well...

Luckily this film is short, just under an hour long.  Plus it has a drinking/smoking game option you can play while watching it, which will probably help.  Long live independent filmmaking!",1240099200,3,1844,4.944444444444445

3100790,5,B0012Z36BM,"There are a lot of low-budget horror movies that try to follow the strange and unwritten rules of cinema that state that some linear storytelling should be what a film evolves around. Most of the entries to the genre, especially when zombies are involved, also try to throw in a fair share of social comments by use of metaphors. Only very few directors are  talented enough to actually make that work, and not everybody can be as genial as Lloyd Kaufman of George A. Romero.
And here we come to what makes POT ZOMBIES such a unique and highly entertaining new film: it doesn't do all that. It doesn't follow all those rules. It doesn't follow any rule. It has no plot, not much of a story, no metaphors whatsoever. It follows a loosely connected chain of people who smoke radioactively contaminated weed untill they turn into flesheating zombies because of it and then make their first victim. And director Justin Powers does this so magnificently well that the entire 90 minutes of the film feel like a roller coaster ride of fantastically gory scenes that only leave the viewer hungry for more. A beautiful female smoker-turned-zombie is a huge  teaser as we never see her actually get into flesh eating action, so all I wanted after the film had ended was a sequel. The good news is that it is already in production! Better still: it will have Nicola Fiore in it! I can't wait!

I had a flippin' good time viewing while following some very simple guidelines. Here's what you do: Fire up a phattie, crack open a forty, light up a smoke, grab some chips, lower your expectation, and kick back and enjoy the sometimes incoherent yet entertaining scenes which do nothing to establish a plot, develop characters, or move the ""story"" along. But hey, who would possibly expect top-notch production with crisp direction and great acting in a movie with that title? I can't exactly put my finger on why but the candy bar budget, bad acting, poor lighting, lousy soundtrack, and laughable special effects truly make Pot Zombies fun to watch---the more stoned the better. So catch a buzz with your pothead buddies and have a blast while watching unsuspecting cretins turn into flesh eaters after smoking tainted weed and getting the most awful case of the munchies ever.",1443052800,,981,4.845238095238095

3335408,5,B0012Z36BM,"I've heard lots of peeps say this, um, film isn't in the ""so bad it's good"" category but I disagree. I had a flippin' good time viewing while following some very simple guidelines. Here's what you do: Fire up a phattie, crack open a forty, light up a smoke, grab some chips, lower your expectation, and kick back and enjoy the sometimes incoherent yet entertaining scenes which do nothing to establish a plot, develop characters, or move the ""story"" along. But hey, who would possibly expect top-notch production with crisp direction and great acting in a movie with that title? I can't exactly put my finger on why but the candy bar budget, bad acting, poor lighting, lousy soundtrack, and laughable special effects truly make Pot Zombies fun to watch---the more stoned the better. So catch a buzz with your pothead buddies and have a blast while watching unsuspecting cretins turn into flesh eaters after smoking tainted weed and getting the most awful case of the munchies ever.",1443052800,,981,4.845238095238095
8248513,5,B0012Z36BM,"i think this movie is a great work of art. Sure, the effects and acting are horrible, however it seems at least self aware and is a good watch with friends. On the christian purity scale it falls on a 1/10: there are homosexuals , nudity and drugs, but there is a amazing role model christian student in the movie. All in all, i wouldn't wipe my ass with this ""movie"" but for 99 cents, it is what it is. And what it is is worth it.",1513123200,,431,3.9655172413793105

8248520,4,B0012Z36BM,"Disclaimer: I kept the volume down/off for most of the not even an hour viewing. I was totally tickled by this movie and I think most people would be if they acknowledged it for what it was, a campy homemade zombie flick that some college kids probably threw together over spring break. Yes the acting is horrible but that's not what this was about. it was about people painted green whose lit up eyes were photo shopped in by someone with a vague understanding of computers. It was visually hilarious. And oh my gosh the squirting blood! The only reason why I'm giving it less than 5 stars: SPOILER........at one point the sexy time music cuts in and its like wait.......is this lesbian porn? not that there's anything wrong with that, but now I can't show this movie to my 13year old who would love this low budget awesomeness. Oh and the schlongs.....the random schlongs. And I'm pretty sure those are real joints but hey, to each his own. I'm not sure I'd pay for this but definitely worth the free watch via Prime.",1483315200,,1019,4.543478260869565
