3473172,4,B001AXTUF2,"The sky that day was a yawning cobalt blue - a crisp, late summer morning infused with feathery glaze of autumn. It was a perfect day for picking apples, strolling along the Charles River, or visiting the Boston Common. But this innocent Tuesday would soon tumble into horror.

By 8:46 a.m., the first commercial airplane out of Boston crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center Complex. Less than 20 minutes later, a second commercial airliner - also originating out of Boston -- struck the South Tower.

The rest is history and that beautiful Tuesday now lives in infamy as September 11, 2001.

There are many stories about 9/11, but few as powerful and heartbreaking as those of Susan Retik and Patti Quigley. The suburban mothers from Massachusetts were pregnant the morning their husbands were murdered by terrorists.

Filmmaker Beth Murphy gives us an up-close and unflinching look at Retik and Quigley in the documentary ""Beyond Belief"" (now showing at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, but you can check the ""Beyond Belief"" web site for national screenings near you).

Before 9/11, Retik and Quigley were affluent mothers living in sprawling Colonials in the suburbs of Boston. The film begins with an emotional retelling of how these two women managed to grieve and find the inner will to give birth and continue to be pillars of strength for their children. They found each other during this emotional chaos and found compassion and companionship.

The remarkable thing about Retik and Quigley is how they used their grief to create a charitable foundation, Beyond the 11th, that supports war widows in Afghanistan. The film has a bold vision and a powerful message about healing. It's difficult not to get emotionally involved with Retik and Quigley as they struggle in the aftermath of the tragedy that destroyed the tranquility of their lives. In fact, sometimes there's a discomfort at how much the two women are willing to share.

But if you manage to get through ""Beyond Belief"" without shedding a few tears, you may want to check and see if you're made of stone.

However, the documentary stumbles when the two women finally arrive in Afghanistan to meet the dozens of women their fundraising efforts are assisting to become self-sufficient. Beyond the 11th gives money to buy the Afghanistan widows incubators to raise chickens and sell eggs.

The juxtaposition between the two rich Americans and the scores of oppressed and poverty-addled widows in Afghanistan is striking. It's telling when Retik expresses her guilt in the way she and her family live compared to the war widows. Both the 9/11 widows appear overwhelmed by what they experience in Afghanistan and as result the film loses its way.

The Afghanistan widows appear in short interviews, but their stories are given short-shift and viewers begin to get the same guilty feelings as Retik and Quigley. The experience of Retik and Quigley - while heartbreaking from an American perspective - pales in comparison to these broken, forgotten women in Afghanistan. These women have starved nearly to death, lost children to hunger, and husbands and sons to warfare.

It's also clear that the generosity of Beyond the 11th is not nearly enough - in fact, it's a drop in the bucket. There are fundamental problems in the country too big for a handful of incubators and chickens to solve.

But even with its flaws, ""Beyond Belief"" is beautifully filmed and at times inspirational. Retik and Quigley are trying to help, trying to use their grief for good rather than revenge. How can you not admire that even if you begin to realize that even with their losses Retik and Quigley are typical Americans - unaware of their advantages and good fortune until they come face to face with the harsh realities of their sisters in Afghanistan?

3473174,4,B001AXTUF2,"Beyond Belief - Susan Retik / Patti Quigley - This movie is about two 9/11 widows who reach out to Afghan widows struggling to live in a world that leaves them behind. The women they help are not terrorists, but left helpless by the lifestyle and customs of an ancient land. Their courage is amazing and the bonds real.  They realized that even the 9/11 widows that got minimal aid and less than others, got 1000X more help than the Afgan women in that populace. Even if it's not Afghanistan, there are others in Myanmar, China, Haiti, and elsewhere that receive no support from a government and are cut off from the husband's family. Usually poverty makes it impossible for any family member to assist. They are on their own with no skill or support but to beg.  The Beyond Belief group created a way to teach a skill and help them earn their own living, meager, but enough to eat and have a place to live. Good story. Two people made a huge difference and still are through their foundation.",1465257600,,993,4.480662983425415

We should watch such as this to make us determined it won't occur here again nor do what it did to those innocent. What is it like to want for the tiniest basics of life?

3473204,3,B001AXTUF2,"It was, overall, a pretty captivating story.  However, for a film titled, ""Beyond Belief,"" the director left me wondering the whole time - what are the beliefs of the two moms?  What we believe is such a HUGE part of who we are as people - it felt disingenuous to leave out the women's motivations.  There must be so much more to these women - are they atheist?  Jewish?  Muslim?  Christian?  Pagan?  What belief are they going beyond?  In terms of getting cash to the women overseas, at the end of the day, their personal beliefs don't matter.  It does, however, make a world of difference to the audience in terms of appreciating where these women are coming from.",1462147200,,666,4.5210084033613445

3473209,5,B001AXTUF2,"This documentary follows the journey of two American women who lost their husbands in the planes used in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. What these women do, upon joining forces with each other, is an extraordinary journey toward hope and peace, as they realize their connection to the many Afghan widows devastated by war while, like them, never having had anything to do with the bloody storms around them. These Afghan widows have no resources without husbands and, if they were to marry again, they would be forced to give up their children to their dead husband's families, which none of them were willing to do. The two Americans seek initially to help in small ways, raising money to send chickens, a valued form of income and survival through both eggs and meat, and then decide to meet these courageous women face to face. There are many honest moments of weakness, sadness, and resistance, and they each have very different reactions to the various challenges they face--which all the more conveys the strength and courage of both our compatriots and their counterparts in the faraway land.",1374278400,4,1112,4.888888888888889
