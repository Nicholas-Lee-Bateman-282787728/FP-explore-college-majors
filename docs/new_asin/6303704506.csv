716159,4,6303704506,"Ruby Dee made a  very fine acting in this poignant story about the  personal tragedy  of Roy Campanella the renowned catcher of the Brookyn Dodgers . He battles against the awful depression and with the great and unvaluable help of his therapist he wins and overcomes .

It's impossible for any viewer not be touched when he tells to 80.000 fans in The Angeles Coliseum: It's good to be alive!

Tastefully directed by Michael Landon.",1104278400,3,433,4.72

7853721,3,6303704506,"Salutary, shadowy, spotty and stagy. Sometimes, ""It's Good To Be Alive"" looks good, as in the spring training scene, but often it has a distracting dimness, as in the climactic ""Roy Campanella Night"" scene. Sometimes, the acting is believable, but often it seems as if the actors are declaiming instead of acting. Still, the film gives a helpful look into the lives of people touched by tragedy. We see how this kind of tragedy doesn't just change one life, and we also see how a person visited by suffering may initially desire to end his life, but later is glad he didn't. The movie also gave me a better appreciation of the Sam Brockingtons of the world.",1357948800,,657,4.6239316239316235
7853722,3,6303704506,"I bought this item for my father, who mentioned that he had been thinking about finding it. The glory of the internet is that in five minutes I found the item, (based on researching an old tv show with the same lead, the name of said lead, then other videos that he had been in, and videos that pertained to baseball) et. al. Needless to say that when the video appeared three days later, wrapped up for his birthday, he was very impressed.

We watched it together. It's old, but very well done, and does an excellent job of captivating the spirit of the book and the man. Essential to any fan of baseball.",1324944000,,606,4.315789473684211
