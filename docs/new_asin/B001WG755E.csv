8347478,5,B001WG755E,This series is great. The premise is so cool.  Wish that I could find the other two seasons.,1430352000,,92,4.111111111111111
8347479,5,B001WG755E,"A strange series but rather charmingly presented, and a depiction of an AUTISTIC CHILD that is performed with such pathos, and winsome. Whether it is a correct depiction, or not, the actor deserves much credit for a performance that could NOT have been easy TO PORTRAY. It was such a touching performance, and the performances overall were FAR FROM INADEQUATE.",1420070400,,360,5.016666666666667
8347480,5,B001WG755E,"I love the series, The Collector, and I wish we could have gotten it on US TV.  I was first introduced to it online, and have struggled to get the remaining seasons, which show up infrequently.  The central character is condemned to be a soul collector for the devil.  To ease his boredom, the devil agrees to let the collector have a chance to save the souls of the  condemned during the hours leading to the end of their contracts.  Sometimes the collector saves the soul;  sometimes they are beyond redemption and the devil wins.  The story avoids the pitfalls of being sappy or horrific, and presents a vehicle for some very good drama.

If you are not certain your tastes and mine coincide, my other favorite SiFi's include Babylon 5, and I'm a big fan of End Game, Under the Dome, and on a more kitsch note, Warehouse 13.",1418342400,,827,4.466666666666667
8347481,5,B001WG755E,My mother's totally obsessed with this show since she discovered it on TV. Great quality and great price. The DVD case was a little damaged on the bottom but nothing too visible.,1398470400,,178,4.59375
8347482,5,B001WG755E,"This is a WONDERFUL series!!!  And how in the name of network television could this series have come and gone from TV unnoticed and without adequate promotion?!  I saw parts of it on YouTube, and it's as good as or better any SciFi series ever on broadcast TV.  Chris Kramer carries the series with an easy likability, and plenty of talent and good looks.  The writing, production quality, music and attention to detail are excellent.  I am chagrined that no major network -- Canadian or American - deigned to broadcast this series during their prime time viewing hours.  It certainly is head and shoulders above anything broadcast concurrently, since or now!!  I want to purchase Seasons 1 and 3.  Any leads will be appreciated.",1380844800,6,729,4.82258064516129
