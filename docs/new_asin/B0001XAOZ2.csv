8216320,4,B0001XAOZ2,"""Jesus, Nuestro Senor"" (or ""Jesus, Our Lord"") was the first film on the life of Christ for the 70's decade.  If the lack of on-line reviews of this movie serves as an indicator, then this film is either largely forgotten or ignored.  This is unfortunate as this movie is faithful to scripture and contains some unique artistic touches.  The film does not follow a ""hollywood"" script with added storylines and creative speculations; the dialogue is taken directly from scripture and the events follow those found in the four gospels.  The initial scenes of Joseph and Mary and the entire Nativity sequence features an off screen narrator, but his presentation stops with the arrival of John the Baptist at the River Jorden.  While the outdoor scenery is beautiful, the John presented here reminded me more of a barbarian warrior borrowed from a foreign Conan exploitation film.  Aside from this, we the baptism of both John the disciple and Jesus Christ.  This is the only film in which Jesus is physically transformed into a dove at his baptism!!!  He soars off to the top of a mountain only to take on human shape again!!!  Christ is then briefly tempted in the wilderness by Satan who is arrayed in a black Dracula style cloak and cap.
  Other points of interest include the arrest, trial and execution of John the Baptist.  John is arrested at the river and brought to Herod's court.  Now, oddly enough, throughout its entire length, this film contains more colors than a basket of Easter eggs.  There are pastel pinks, blues, yellows, purples, deep reds, greens, and golds at every turn.  The inside of Herod's palace as well as the Jewish temple look like leftovers from a particularly psychedelic episode of HR Puffnstuff.  Within the pink halls of Herod we encounter a fairly effective dance by the most voluptuosly endowed Salome of them all.  This inturn leads to John's beheading, which is most graphically depicted here.  Not only do we see his head on a blood soaked plate, but the director throws in some surprise horror effects and actually has John's head move back and forth on the plate!!!  Perhaps this is to show Herod's guilt?
  The all important factor in any film on Christ's life is the question of our Savior's divinity.  Here we can relax and enjoy as Jesus is divine.  He heals a madman, cures a blind man, feeds the five thousand (more like feeds the 50 in this outing), turns water into wine, raises sons and daughters from the dead (including Lazarus), walks on water (though no storm or rough waters appear in this film), and most importantly is resurrected from the dead.  Jesus is given one miraculous talent in this film that does not appear in scripture.  when he saves the adultress from being stoned by the crowd, he confronts each participant with their own sin via mental telepathy!!!  The movie also presents a fair amount of Christ's teachings.  Jesus and his disciples (who unfortunately are rather faceless and underdeveloped) spend time traveling the wilderness and conversing.  The teaching segments also contain a truncated Sermon on the Mount.
  The characterization of Jesus in this movie is rather interesting.  First off, he appears rather regal from the moment we meet him; the image of a poor carpenter is non-existent here.  He is dressed in spotless white robes complete with bright red draperies; it's almost as if he walked straight out of a Da Vinci painting.  The actor, Claudio Brook, is an attractive ethnic looking man, but the director is bent on providing an American ""living room "" Jesus.  This Jesus has a huge mane of hair complete with golden highlights.  Brook also looks slightly old for the part as the real Jesus was in his early thirties.  Despite any shortcomings in the visual portrayal, Claudio Brook's Jesus is likeable.  He is the very self assured Savior whose bold character and charisma never cease; he is the born leader type.  Those who liked Max Von Sydow's elevated portrayal of Jesus in ""The Greatest Story Ever told"" will like this rendition.  It would have been nice to see some more of the human side of Christ; some smiles, some laughter, some genuine emotional pain.  Instead, this Christ is rather stoic, even during his painful struggles at Gethsemane.  This Jesus excels in authority and leadership, but lacks the ""closeness"" needed to make him fully human.
  Still, we sympathize with Brook's Jesus.  Sadness builds as he is betrayed by Judas at the Last Supper and then arrested and tried by both the Pharisees and Pilate (the Herod sequence is also included here).  The Pharisees are the main antagonists throughout the film as the Romans are not often encountered until the end.  Pilate resembles a mobster ruling from what appears to be a covered wooden stage similar to those found in any campground or picnic grove.  He is a bureaucrat and is generally unconcerned for the plight of Jesus and although he washes his hands of Jesus's blood, he is not the sympathetic figure presented in some other films.  Jesus is beaten and whipped by Roman soldiers in this film, and while it is no ""Passion of the Christ"", the violence is graphically depicted.  The cruelty persists down the Via de la Rosa as Jesus is brutally whipped while carrying the whole cross to Golgotha.
  The crucifixion sequence is true to scripture.  Jesus forgives his executioners, saves one of the criminals, puts Mary in John's care, thirts for sour wine, and cries out to God.  The sky darkens and thunder booms, but no rain falls.  A bright light appears in the sky and an earthquake shakes the temple.  Oddly enough, this movie shows the saintly dead crashing out of their tombs!!!  Another shot at a horror flick?  No, actually this event is not shown in any other Jesus movie that I've seen.  Another weird thing about this film is that the entire burial and tomb sequence is absent.  Perhaps for budgetery reasons this segment was excluded.  We do see a resurrected Jesus confronting a ""doubting"" Thomas, teaching his disciples in the wilderness, and finally ascending into Heaven.  In closing, I'll note that this old film has a crystal clear and extremely bright transfer!!!  Almost like it was made yesterday!!!",1225411200,4,6188,4.846374045801527
