8188157,5,B000P1CKES,"My husband and I, enthusiastic cooks and bakers, enjoy three cooking shows, ""America's Test Kitchen,"" its offspring ""Cook's Country,"" and this one, and while all three are very much worth watching, we think Alton Brown manages the science-of-cooking aspect with the most charm and imagination.  These DVD's of some early  shows are in good condition, with no picture or sound problems, and were promptly delivered.  We're glad to have these DVD's, the more so, since we've heard that the series has stopped as of this year.",1320364800,5,523,5.058139534883721
