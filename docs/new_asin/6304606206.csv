902652,1,6304606206,"Not the worst film I've ever seen, but a close second.  My roommate's quote for this film was ""It made me want to claw out my own eyes and stuff them in my ears.""
This film is a mis-mash of fairy tales, combining ""Swan Lake"" with elements from ""Cinderella,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" and ""Beauty and the Beast."" From ""Sleeping Beauty"" we have the father despairing of her birth until late in his life. Yet we never meet Odette's mother. From ""Beauty and the Beast"" we have the theme of love should transcend appearance and the motif where Rothbart comes to Odette every night to ask her to marry him so he can have her kingdom legally. And from ""Cinderella"" we have the ball. After Odette's father is killed and she disappears, Derrick's mother attempts to convince her son to wed another since she thinks Odette is dead. In this we get the song ""Princesses on Parade,"" where Derrick is forced to sit through a long line of women paraded for him in outlandish costumes and their finer points ticked off like a bad singles ad.
The film suffers greatly from being too derivative, too predictable and trying to be too many things to too many people. This is truly bad animation. The Swan Princess is everything that is trite and annoying in all of Disney's films all rolled into one film. The songs are horrendous but fortunately immemorable, there is no characterization to speak of and a concert film has a better (and less predictable) plot. However, apparently some people really love this movie, but in my opinion if you want ""Swan Lake"", go to the ballet.",1033257600,8,1551,4.619565217391305
902653,5,6304606206,"I first watched this when I was six (I'm thirteen now) and loved it - I saw it a dozen times in one week. This is a great movie for young children - and even now it's one of my favorite animations. Avoiding the 2D-ness of the characters, the music is wonderful (I've got a song stuck in my head right now; I rewatched it yesterday and just had to keep replaying the first song in the movie, ""This Is My Idea"").
Perhaps it's the fact that I loved this movie beyond words when I was a child - I even made up a game with my sister where I was named Odette and she Jasmine - but I still can't shake the feeling that this is a great work of art and something that should earn a spot on your shelf.",1027641600,2,692,3.880281690140845
902654,4,6304606206,"This classic fairytale story is based on possibly the most famous ballet of all time - Swan Lake. It is loosely based however, and follows the traditional Disney pattern of storytelling with romance, adventure, slapstick, musical numbers animal sidekicks, and of course with love conquering all.
Princess Odette (Michelle Nicastro)and Prince Derek (Howard McGillin) are betrothed from an early age by their parents in the hopes that their two kingdoms will be united. The only problem is - the two can't stand each other. However, unlike most other romance movies where the hero and heroine go through many trials before realising they're in love, Odette and Derek fall for each other within the opening five minutes of the film as they grow from child to adult during the opening song. However, due to Derek's claims that Odette's beauty is the only thing that matters to him, Odette rejects his marriage proposal and she and her father return home to their kingdom. They do not get far however - the evil Count Rothbart (Jack Palance) is waiting for them, and transforms into a terrifying beast and kidnaps Odette, changing her into a swan. At the reclusive lake that Odette is taken to, Odette learns that she is a swan every day, except for an hour each night when she changes back into human form. The only way to break this curse is for her one true love to make a vow of everlasting love and prove it to the world. Rothbart's reasons for kidnapping Odette are to force her into marriage so that he might take over the kingdom. Odette refuses, convinced that Derek will save her, and with her animal friends Speed the turtle, Jean-Bob (John Cleese) the frog and Puffin the (what else?) puffin they lure Derek to the lake to witness her metamorphosis for himself. Reunited, the lovers make a plan - tomorrow night at his mother's ball Derek will give Odette his vow of everlasting love. However, Rothbart is one step ahead of him and imprisons Odette, sending his disguised servant to the palace in her place...
The protagonists Odette and Derek are a satisfactory hero and heroine for the story. Odette is the typical fairytale princess (blonde hair, blue eyes, etc) but has some very twenty-first century ideals - she refuses to marry Derek if all he sees is his beauty (though strangely enough she is singing a few minutes later about how much she loves him) and takes it into her on hands (or wings) to bring Derek to the lake. Derek, however is an imbecile. Among other things he insults his bride-to-be, nearly kills her, and then confesses his love to another woman. His redeeming features are his singing voice and his heroic athletic abilities with a bow and arrow.
The secondary characters are far more enjoyable - Odette's animal friends will appeal mostly to kids - the heroic Scottish Puffin, the slow but steady Speed, and (cleverly following the fairytale of the Frog Prince) the snobbish and proud Jean-Bob who believes all he has to do to be transformed into a prince is to be kissed by a fair maiden. Adults should warm to Derek's flustering and hysterical mother Queen Uberta, who comes across as the typical interferring and meddling mother, and Derek's consort, the wry and sarcastic Rogers. Also worth noting is Derek's best friend, the cowardly Brom who inevitably swallows his fears to save the day.
The Swan Princess is on the whole an enjoyable, traditional fairytale with all the components one would expect. Great songs, good animation, successfully funny jokes and an interesting story with only a plot holes all contribute to this. A few scenes got on my nerves, such as Rothbart's techni-colour, disco-like musical number and the down-right tacky beauty-pagent style of the ball, but the last twenty minutes of the movie - including Odette's escape from the prison, the imposter-Odette drawing Derek's attention from the desparate swan at the windows, and Derek's final fight with Rothbart more than make up for it. This movie is a must for all fairytale lovers.",1027036800,46,3998,4.8464912280701755
902655,5,6304606206,"I first saw this movie in the theaters, and it has been ages since I've seen it.  I've now watched it twice since I bought it a couple weeks ago, and I like it more each time.  The characters are well drawn and well developed, the story is involving, and the songs are great.  I'm twenty years old and I love this movie.  It does it's job, which is to entertain and teach a good lesson.  What more could you ask for in an animated film?",1026604800,2,436,4.023255813953488

It was a brilliant mix of humour, romance, & awesome songs!!!!!!!! ""For Longer Than Forever"" will stick in your head for days!!!!! The main characters are:
Princess Odette-Damsel in Distress
Prince Derek-big hero guy
Rothbart-evil sorceror
Jean-Bob, the ego-filled frog who thinks he's a prince
Lorenzo Trudge-A-Long/Speed, wise turtle & Jean-Bob's best friend
Puffin-a tough puffin bird who owes Odette
There's also Queen Uberta & Lord Rogers, but I'm too lazy too describe them. Anyways, enjoy this movie, but don't even THINK about the sequels, THEY [STINK]!!!!!!!!!!!!!",997747200,5,710,5.348214285714286
902657,1,6304606206,"I guess ""terrible"" could be too rash.  If you like really bad song lyrics and the most annoying melodies imaginable, this is right up your alley.  The second movie is definately worst than the first.  Prince Erik's mother, whose voice is done by Christy Landers, is the most grating voice I can remember hearing.  The whining she does about ""my birthday, my birthday!"" (obviously the fault of the writers) is enough to make me throw up!  Or at the least throw the movie away.  But alas, I have a 3 year old who loves it.",969840000,,520,4.421052631578948
902658,4,6304606206,"The Swan Princess stands out for developing the character of Derek, the Prince.  I also appreciated that the princess was not impressed by someone who was in love with only her beauty.  The music and animation were high  quality, and it has become a beloved family favorite in our household. I  wish it had received more attention, making tie-ins a bit more easy to come  by. Although, being harder to find may provide its own special charm.  By  the way, we found the sequel disappointing.

As children we learn they were not attracted to each other,  but as they became older they became closer. The big question that Princess Odette has for Prince Derek is why he truly loves her. At first he can't answer what other than beauty he likes, but later in the movie he finds the true answer of loving her.

I found a lot of inspiration from other films that made this film enjoyable. This film has great graphics, well drawn characters with beautiful colors. The way they animate running water is stunning.

903052,4,6304606206,"A great movie which my five year old daughter really enjoyed, and I did too.

First, my only real complaint is about the voices of Rothbart (Jack Palance), the villain, and Speedy (Steven Write), the turtle.  Rothbart is simply too raspy, breathy, and quiet to be heard in many scenes.  I know that was Palance's signature voice, but it just didn't work here because 1) he was hard to understand, and 2) his voice sounded really out of place compared to the other actors' voices, which came through loud and clear.  It's a real shame, too, because when you pay close attention, it's actually a great performance:  menacing, witty, and funny.  And Speedy, although, yes, a turtle, is so slow and dull to listen to, that after the first couple lines of monotonous drone, you just don't care anymore.  Also a shame because it drags down what could have been a cute sub plot with Jean-Bob (John Cleese), a delusional frog who thinks he's The Frog Prince.  Speedy is too boring, Jean-Bob is shouting due to the action, and the result is a muddled meh.

Now the good stuff.  The music is very well done and some of the songs are quite catchy.  The story is endearing and the acting and animation are all very good.  A couple of the ""broadway"" style numbers in the second half seem to jump the shark a bit, but they're still fun to watch.  Oddly enough, the scenes with just the people are better than the scenes with the animals of the lake.  Odd because Disney fare usually relies on cute animals/magical creatures to carry the human characters.  A welcome break from Disney's approach to story telling and animation, which are great in their own right, but it's always nice to find quality, feature-length animation from a different studio.

All in all, a solid 4 stars and a good flick for the little ones.",1464739200,,1803,4.5875

Admirable and wise, to be sure, but the damsel in distress still gets rescued from the villain by the strong and brave prince.  So, they failed to empower the princess once again.  It was mindless and occasionally enjoyable, but ultimately a waste of time.",1448064000,,560,4.863157894736842

904228,4,6304606206,"I can tell when the suspense in a show gets my granddaughter (almost 8) on the edge of her seat. She'll want to sit real close. I won't say she was actually scared watching this, but there are definitely action scenes in this movie where the outcome is uncertain. There are also quite a few heavy-handed confrontations between the Evil King and the Swan Princess. In most of these scenes, the king is trying to force his will upon the princess; essentially he's trying to subjugate or enslave her. These kind of scenes can be a bit unnerving for young children. My granddaughter's smart enough to know about happy endings and G-ratings, and going in, she knew there would be no reason to be fearful of the outcome. And yet, there she was, seated close, on the verge of being scared.

She still loved the movie and would watch it again. (You know kids, they can watch the same movie twenty times, day after day.}

Is this movie appropriate for young children? Should it be rated PG? Beats me. I don't know. But let's look at the story. An evil man asks a woman to marry her. She's in love with another and refuses. The evil man then puts a nasty curse on her and tries through various nefarious means to get her to marry him. When she continues to refuse, and after he locks her in a flooded dungeon, he cooks up a plan to destroy her chance at true love. When this plan fails, he tries to kill her -- and he almost succeeds. The fact is, this is Swan Lake, and Swan Lake was originally penned by Johann Karl August Musus in the middle of the 18th century, later composed as a ballet by Tchaikovsky. It was never meant for children.

In all fairness, I think it's OK. I just wouldn't sit young kids down in front of it and walk away.

Meanwhile, Jack Palance, who is almost always terrific, doesn't quite work for me as the voice of the evil king. He plays it straight-up evil, and maybe a little too much so for a G-rated cartoon.",1446768000,,1930,4.337950138504155

It made them laugh, get a little nervous, and root for the Prince and Princess. l loved it because it is such a clean and uplifting story. I really like how the villain was bad, but not super, over the top evil (like almost all villains are these days). Also, I really liked how modestly dressed all the women were. I very much appreciate modesty and teach my own children to respect our bodies, but it gets a little difficult to show them movies that are degrading. All around the movie was tasteful, super funny, and such a feel good story that I give this movie 5 stars. 100% kid appropriate.

The special features are just some games and a read-a-long that will entertain a small child the day you bring the disc home, but for DVD collector's to call this a Special Edition is insulting. What about the Making-Of featurette that was on the Collector's Edition VHS? Maybe Nest Entertainment owns the rights to that, since it was on their VHS release of the film and not Turner's VHS release. It can also be found on Nest Entertainment's 2006 DVD release of The Swan Princess: Escape from Castle Mountain, again released on DVD in 2009 by Sony as The Swan Princess and the Secret of the Castle (the foreign release title). But they couldn't at least include the Eternity music video by Dreams Come True? That was on the VHS. The Sing-a-long's are a nice touch to an otherwise lackluster release. The movie ios also Full Frame, not Widescreen. The quality is a step above VHS quality, that's about it. This DVD was originally released in 2005 under Columbia/TriStar Home Entertainment, and repackaged in 2009 under Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. The cover art and supplementary material on both discs is the same, except the disc art work is different, and both releases come with a slipcase, the former being a plan cardboard case that folds out and explains each bonus feature, and the latter release being a lenticular case.",1429574400,,1390,4.795833333333333

The music is upbeat and catchy that I even find myself signing along with my children. The animation is good, the characters are strong, and overall the story is beautiful.

This is a children's movie, of course, so there are ""holes"" and gaps in the story, but it can easily be overlooked.

The Princess is a joke and so is the prince. The villain is not scary and is a big idiot. It would have been better if the princess and prince didn't know each other then their stupid ""love"" at first sight would be more believable.

We bought 2 DVDs, one for her and one for us. Both Papa and she are very satisfied.

As a little girl, I found this movie to be funny and exciting. I thought the songs were wonderful. Recently, I bought this DVD as a gift for my five year old niece; she watched it three times in a 24-hour period, and I watched a lot of it with her.

907742,2,6304606206,"Okay, I know this is a kid's movie, but that is no excuse for the amount of plot holes and how tragically obvious they are in this movie. WARNING SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.

  What it did good...
The beginning of the movie actually started off pretty good. I liked the whole they hate each other song that ended with them falling in love. It gave some dynamic into their relationship, it showed them maturing and growing, and honestly that whole number could have been a movie itself. Spot on.
When Odette rejected Derek because he only loved her for her beauty. THAT WAS AWESOME. I automatically wanted to give this movie five stars for that. And then it got BETTER. She leaves and he regrets her going, realizing it was more than her beauty that he was attracted to. He realized he always had feelings for her in a way, but being a naive kid, he channeled it wrong. It wasn't until he was older and more mature that he realized it. That was good. I liked that he regretted not knowing how to explain why he loved her properly and that instead of telling her, he now wanted to prove it through action! And then he gets the perfect opportunity. Odette is captured by an evil wizard and her father is killed. Rescuing her would prove his love for her. AMAZING. If that was what the rest of the movie had been about, easy 5 star kids movie.

But...no. After this point, the movie was ruined.

  What they did wrong...
1. After Odette is captured, she doesn't even seem to care that her father is dead! Take Beauty and the Beast as an example. Belle never just FORGETS her father after he leaves Beast's castle. She wants to see him again. Odette? She never mentions her father for the rest of the movie or even shows any sign of mourning or sadness. How heartless!
2. Suddenly, Odette seems to forget that she was upset that Derek only loved her for her beauty. Apparently, that doesn't matter anymore and she starts singing about how they were meant to be together! What!? If you honestly thought you were meant to be together, you would have accepted his proposal as was! You wouldn't have said no and then LEFT. It makes absolutely no sense for her to be yearning after Derek at this point. None at all. What I expected to happen was that Derek would come to her rescue, going on a great adventure just to find her and when they met again, she would realize that he really did love her all along! THAT would have been a good story! This though? Nope.
3. Why doesn't Derek's vow of eternal love work? I know he says it to the wrong girl and all, but he says Odette's name specifically in his vow! I expected that to end up being the fine print of the terms! That the wizard didn't expect that to work, but it does and his plot is revealed and the prince then demands to know where he's keeping her. That might have redeemed the plot for me. But, no. Apparently, being specific in a vow has nothing to do with it.
4. WHY does the Prince vowing his eternal love to another woman almost kill her? WHERE was that explanation in the terms and conditions of this curse? Did this wizard even KNOW Derek when he put the curse on her? I mean, he was banished before Odette was promised to wed this guy. What is this? This is so random! Why put it there? Her whole tragic death scene didn't even make my eyes water because I was too focused still on the fact that this was about as random as her suddenly loving the prince just because she was kidnapped!

What it did good kept me from rating this one star. But what it did bad, IT DID BAD. I mean this was REALLY bad. The songs were great and all but the plot just did NOT hold up. Even as a kid this would have confused me.",1377648000,3,3663,4.275613275613275

Oh, wow, that was so disappointing. Over the course of the film, he didn't change at all, and she married him anyway. What a terrible lesson to teach girls: In the end, your only value is what you look like, and you may as well just accept that.

Other gripes: Cheap animation, insipid songs, inexplicable puffin.",1372550400,,661,4.365853658536586
908145,4,6304606206,"Before I say anything else, if you have kids, they will at least like this movie. It got a lot of laughs out of the boy and girl I was babysitting.
I watched this again for the first time in years after not seeing it since I was a kid, and I was pleased, but just not dazzled. ""Far Longer Than Forever"" is a song for the books, and the characters are humorous and likeable -- everyone from the protagonists to the background characters have their share of the spotlight and enough personality to be memorable. However, giving every character that much screen time seems to take away from the protagonists' exposure slightly. My biggest criticism was that the animation wasn't up to the standard I expected. When I saw, as an adult with understanding of the subject, that it was directed by a former Disney animation director, I couldn't wait to see, but that part was a bit disappointing. The actual art is lovely, but I'd expect animation of a slightly better quality. It's not bad animation by any means; I just had my bar set pretty high with the buzzwords ""Disney animation director"".
But if you're not an animated movie fanatic like me and you're just showing this to your kids, I am more than sure they'll love it -- I'm going to watch this again and again, and I think it's a must see for any fan of animation even if it's not the most beautifully animated piece ever made (in my opinion).",1372291200,,1396,4.45703125

908569,5,6304606206,"Like many commenters on this product, I too, grew up with the Disney animated classics that were dominating the box office when this rare find came out in 1994. My mother bought the VHS for me in 1996 and I instantly fell in love with it. Just yesterday, I, now 25 years old, decided to revisit this old friend and see if it was merely childhood innocence that allowed me to love it so much. It wasn't! As one other reviewer declared, this film proved that Disney, as much as this fan advocates and supports their classic feature films, does not necessarily hold the monopoly on the ""Animated Fairytale Formula"". When the movie was over, I had sung along with every song, and had a smile on my face.

The opening sequence is well-narrated and paced giving us adequate introductions to our fairytale plotline (i.e. - Odette and Derek, the heirs of two separate monarchs named William and Uberta, respectively, who seek to have their kingdoms united by marrying the kids) and obstacles (i.e. Rothbart - a treacherous, scheming sorcerer plotting to take William's kingdom by magic). The following sequence delivers our first number ""This Is My Idea"" (this is one of three songs from the album I personally have on my iPod, and when you see the visuals the song was written for, you can see why). In this fairytale, despite being betrothed to each other, like Phillip and Aurora in Sleeping Beauty, our greeting pair of Odette and Derek actually loathe each other as well as the grueling summers that they are forced to spend together consistently throughout their childhoods. It is a funny, cute, and romantic song accompanied by good animation (not Disney good, but good). However, Nest Entertainment doesn't stop at only that pleasant twist to the fairytale formula, oh no! When Odette grows from (to use Derek's own words) ""such an ugly duckling into a swan"", he's convinced that that is reason enough for them to marry and unite their two kingdoms in accordance with their parents' ultimate hope. Odette, however, rightfully insulted and wary of his attitude, promptly rejects the idea despite the fact that she has in fact fallen in love with him herself, telling her father as they return back to their own land that she needs ""to know that he loves her for just being her"", not merely for her beauty. Derek has a funny advisor, Lord Rodgers who wisely berrates the prince for what is in fact his flub in the marriage proposal, but before anything can be done to rectify the situation, King William's party is attacked by Rothbart, who has regained his powers during exile, and now sets about to fulfill his vow of revenge against the kindly king. William and his men are murdered and Odette is kidnapped and taken to Swan Lake, a secluded estate where she spends the day in the form of a swan and can only regain human form at night when she is on the lake under the moon's light.

The rest of the story is what you expect to witness in a children's film with funny side characters, some antics on their behalf, romance, magic, adventure and danger all well presented and striking all the right chords in your emotions. After all, we don't watch fairytales for their impeccable logic and cynical realism! We watch them for the innocent optimism they dare to promote despite the harshness we (and those who lived during the birth of these timeless tales) witness around us. The Swan Princess lives on because it dares to show a couple who fall in love, really fall in love, and are BOTH forced to back up their overtures with actions. With a well-done and truly menacing villain poised to stop their happy ending at every turn, the stakes are appropriate and the climax is terrifying, yet triumphant in every sense of the word. While only loosely based on the classic story of Swan Lake, this is one movie where you can relinquish the grown-up critic's all-seeing eye and just appreciate the story for what it offers: a classic fairytale with some very 21st-century ideas! This was my favorite fairytale film, now that I really think about it, and I am happy to see that I can still love it today.",1365033600,,4100,4.677285318559557

908728,1,6304606206,"I love to watch a movie to escape the drama of real life!  This movie did not afford me this luxury.  It is trite....not fresh or original but boring. It resembles real life too much.  I thought the film would portray the emotional high of meeting someone and falling in love and end with a happily ever after. Instead, it shows a couple already married and a bride already frustrated with the grooms lack of attention or neglect of her. Odette is beautiful and the prince has lost that loving feeling and would rather chase after bad guys or save the kingdom 24 hours a day than make love to Odette. This is too much like real life and not what I want to see when I view a Disney romantic movie. I prefer the high of the first few years of meeting each other and not the moments when the couple began to grow comfortable with each other and take each other for granted and need a transfusion to make the love grow strong again. Lastly, the inclusion of Odette's mother in law.  Are they kidding?  Who wants to see a mother in law in a disney romantic movie, let alone in your own home during the first 5 years of marriage. It resembles real life too much with the mother in law. Derek's mom is nothing short of annoying and would definitely kill all romance and be annoying as all get out. It is clearly obvious she has no boundaries what so ever and would speak her mind when it would be inappropriate regards their children, their life and anything at all. I speak from experience with this. I endured a mother in law who did all these things. It was awful and forgettable all the way down to the awful boundaries or nonexistent boundaries. Case and point: taking my few days old newborn early in the wee hours, without asking, out of the crib before the princess awakens (not a problem for some I am sure. this may be a sign of an already strained relationship due to her poor boundaries or unsolicited advice), taking the front seat and putting the princess (me) in the backseat while she sat up front with my spouse, constant put downs, etc etc  I will not go on. I may run out of room on amazon. In conclusion, leave the mother in law out. She has forgotten what romance is all about and will spoil everything with dysfunctional behavior. Allow them to meet and fall in love and live happily ever after in my dreams. Do not begin a movie with them married and already not happily ever after. Good day!  I am going to watch The Princess and the Frog!  A real romance movie by Disney. p.s. It is clear that this movie has only brought back some bad memories for me and awakened some of my frustrations with married life. I can only give it 1 star.

908868,3,6304606206,"While clearly a children's story, in the best tradition of feature-length animation, it manages to get in quite a few clever jokes mostly adults will appreciate. This would be a good movie for adults and children to share.

King William banished the evil sorcerer Rothbart from his kingdom for plotting against him. Rothbart of course vows revenge.

William's daughter Odette is a couple of years younger than the neighboring kingdom's Prince Derek, so their parents naturally plot to throw them together, spending every summer with Odette and William visiting with Derek and his mother, Queen Uberta. Since Odette's mother never appears, one wonders why William doesn't simply marry Uberta and save the children the grief. Because they hate each other as children. We all know how that ends: they grow up and suddenly see some advantages in having this arranged match.

But Derek makes a terribly stupid mistake and insults Odette, so she decides she doesn't want to marry him after all. Before he can properly apologize and set things right, Rothbart kidnaps Odette and puts her under a spell. He turns her into a swan, but if she's on the lake near his castle when the moon shines on her, she will turn back into a human princess until the moon goes down.

The rest of the story is a pretty conventional brave prince rescues beautiful princess, except for the humor of it all. Odette has two close friends, a turtle named Speed and a frog with a French accent (of course) named Jean-Bob. Together with a puffin who shows up to help plan Odette's rescue, they do the best comedy routines and help save the princess.

Of course it's more complicated than that, but the plot elements will all seem pretty familiar to those of us who grew up on Disney. This is not Disney, and in fact in some ways is more clever than most Disney romantic fantasies. The animation is the old-fashioned kind, and really rather pretty. Altogether, an amusing way to spend a couple of hours.",1336694400,,1970,4.765395894428153
908869,2,6304606206,"I am was a student of an animation class at my high school, and am currently attending college for a major in animation. So it is a hobby of mine to watch old nostalgic cartoons, so I can observe the animation techniques along with with the stories that are webed in it. I also personally love to watch cartoons based of fairy tales/fables/ballets/ETC. So I can observe and compare. But this time I wasn't that impressed.

  But I have to say I wasn't as impressed as I used to be with this one. I remember as a very young kid, both me and my sister used to watch this movie, (or MOVIES, as I remember it.) So I thought I would be in for a great story. But instead I just found something that seems to made just for kids, with no other interpretation. Being a student of animation I did notice some really good animation techniques, and a few characters with appeal. But also really bad writing.
  Some good things to say are that the backrounds are beautiful, with just a hint of CGI only when its necessary. And there are even shadows for some of the characters. It should also but noted that all the minor characters have very bouncy movements, to make them comedic, while the more serious characters like odette have the ability to hold still once in a while, to give her a more realistic appeal. So it is very pretty....but thats it.
  There doesnt seem to be alot of moral in this movie. There is even is a scene when the prince remarks that Odette is beautiful, and even says  ""What else is there."" Alot of the songs are just tiny little gigs used for filler, and the one ballad in this film. Longer than forever, is kinda forgettable.
  And the is a major mimic of Disney in this film. Odette's hair is the same as Ariel's only blond, and she has Auroras jaw and eyes. In fact the beginning seems way to slimier to the beginning of sleeping beauty.
  And the writing is TERRIBLE.......

  **Spoiler Alert**
In the beginning to ensure their marriage Odette and Derek have been seeing each other every summer, and it appears they hate each other. But on their final meeting they suddenly fall in love, for one reason, there both beautiful. Which is when Derek says ""What else is there"" to which Odette becomes really offended, even though that the same reason she suddenly falls in love with him.
  When Odettes father is killed and Odette herself goes missing, (Since her body isn't found, you cant say she dead!) nobody except Derek seems to care. Whenever he mentions her, everyone's like ""Oh Derek shes gone, just move on and find another. Even his mother, who claims it was her idea for the two to be married in the first place.
  When Derek finds Odette and learns about her curse. He then decided that tomorrow she should come to the ball. To which there are many problems such as there being no moon to transform her into a human, and the fact that she watched by a evil sorcerer. In fact how did her expect her to get to the ball? did he honestly expect her to walk all the way from the sorcerer castle to his, THATS A LONG WAY, all the other guest can in carriages, and not to mention there's a forest in between the two castles, she could have been eaten by a bear od something. WHY DIDN'T HER PROMISE TO COME BACK FOR HER.
  And finally when Odette is imprisoned in the cell, her little animal friends think of some complicated plan of breaking a wall where shes captured while avoiding alligators...yet earlier in the movie they were able to sneak Inside the evil castle to retrieve a map, while both the sorcerer and his little wench were inside!!! But now that there both gone and at the ball, they cant do that again.

  I know I'm probably over analyzing this movie, and I know cartoons don't always make perfect sense, but this is a bit much. Its pretty, ""But what else is there"" Its something I recommend for little kids, nothing more. At the end, I think I would have found more morals, and better writing in the Animated Barbie version of Swan lake.",1335657600,3,3976,4.407660738714091
908870,5,6304606206,"Let me also start by saying that I am a 22 year-old woman (YES, 22!) and I have been totally in love with this movie since it came out in '94.

The plot: Without going into too much detail of how the movie goes, I will say that I am impressed that it was shown that Prince Derek and Princess Odette got to know each other before deciding to live ""happily ever after."" This movie not only shows that it is important to love (and like) someone for what is on the inside and not just their looks, but it also shows that when you find that love, you will fight the worst of the worst for them.
If you're looking at this movie from an adult perspective and with adult logic, then you may not get or even like this movie or many other pure classic animated tales that teach lessons and morals. Every time I watch the movie I learn something new. Something is there that I didn't pick up on before. Just because you're no longer a child doesn't mean that a children's movie can't teach you things. The Swan Princess is one of the animated films that are actually age-appropriate and educational. That, unfortunately, cannot be said about alot of the films that are out today. I am proud to say that I am almost 25 years old and I still watch the movie.

The DVD has lots of fun features, such as dressing Odette for her wedding, a bow and arrow game, and a story book read along.  Inside the tradition of the swan princess, Nest has managed to create an original and clever story, full of laughs and heart felt moments. This movie is appropriate for all audiences, with only a small bit of violence when Prince Derek is fighting the Great Animal.  Nest went on to make two sequels to the swan princess, which are entertaining, although nothing can come close to this fantastic original.  For the small child who has watched and adored Disney movies, don't be afraid to branch out and watch this non-disney film, it will definitely fulfill all expectations in quality and content.",1324425600,,938,4.626506024096385

destined to be wed. While growing up they didn't like the idea, but when they became adults they saw the beauty in each other and just when they had decided to be wed
the princess' father was killed and she was taken by an angry, evil sorcerer who had dissented from her fathers kingdom when she was just a little girl. Now it is up to
her Prince to be to find her and save her from the evil sorcerer. This movie has comedy, romance, sadness and happiness all wound together in a charming tale that anyone

Thus, I would only watch the DVD again for the movie, not to pursue the special features.
Also- although the song ""Eternity"" by Japanese band Dreams Come True is playing on the end titles to the movie, the music video for the song is missing from the DVD makeup. On the original VHS, it played after the end titles.

909156,1,6304606206,"this movie was okay when i was a kid. my friend and i recently watched it at her house and HATED it.

first of all, the animal side kicks were just annoying and not funny at all. if you must watch this i suggest skipping through all the parts that involve just animals. and the song they sing was too long and boring.

odette as a ""heroine"" left much to be desired. when she asks why derek loves her and she gets mad when he just tells her she's beautiful, well, what did she expect? there wasn't much more to her than that.

the villain was stupid. his villain song was stupid. you want a real villain song? watch hunchback of notre dame or even the little mermaid. ""no more mr. nice guy?"" well, when was he ever nice. also, what kind of villain waits until the heroine wants to marry him to get her kingdom legally? that's what brainless suitors do, not villains. he should've just whipped her into obedience and forcibly taken her kingdom/ forced her into marriage. too harsh? well you get the picture.

ALSO, may i ask who was running this kingdom of odette's? her mom is dead, her dad is dead and she's out of the picture. so who the hell was running the kingdom??? plot hole!

to be honest, derek's mom and odette's dad should have just gotten married. although isn't this set a long time ago where arranged marriages were the norm? i can't understand why the parents would spend approx. 18 years gambling the future of their united kingdoms on the off chance their kids would fall in love and get married. they should have just forced them to get married.

also, much like in the lion king (""simbaaaaaaa! look inside yourself!"" instead of ""scar killed me"") why couldn't the dad just tell derek who killed him? why'd he have to be all cryptic ""things are not what they seem!"" instead of just saying rothbart killed him? maybe he didn't see him clearly? i still suspect he knew who his killer was.

and i just don't see derek's motivation for wanting to find odette and save her. he only liked her for about 10 minutes after a lifetime of hating her. i also thought the scene with him training was stupid. maybe instead of playing courtyard games he could get off his ass and do some saving? it's a thought. moron.
also, he had a funnily proportioned body: skinny legs and a wide torso, plus he looked the same as a kid as he did an adult.

my friend also had the 2 sequels (this was successful enough for 2 straight to vhs sequels? really?) which needless to say we did not watch. small children might like this. anyone older than 6 probably won't. avoid!!!",1289347200,6,2563,4.4038054968287526

909163,4,6304606206,"I remember watching this movie years ago when it first came out, but I did not remember how funny this movie is! I was thoroughly entertained the whole way! The animation is a lesser quality than what I am used to seeing from Disney animation, but it is solid and the animals and people moved fairly naturally. The colors were bright during happy times and dark during the sad times so it is very easy to see what part of the story you are in and who the good guys and the bad guys are. The songs were charming and really fit the story, though most of them were really short -- no more than a few lines -- and then they go back to talking. It is not like you would ever hear them on the radio, but they really added to my enjoyment level of this movie.

The secondary characters were absolutely my favorite part of this film. The prince's widowed mother (voiced by Sandy Duncan) is determined to see her son marry and she goes to every matchmaking length imaginable (including a Princesses on Parade beauty pageant at a ball); the prince's best friend, Bromley, (voiced by Joel McKinnon Miller) is clumsy and cowardly, but insists that he is just as good as the prince and keeps trying to prove it; the court musicians were a riot dressed as animals for the Prince to practice ""hunting""; the Princess's frog companion, Jean-Bob (voiced by John Cleese) truly believes that he will turn into a prince if he can just get a kiss from Odette; the slow-moving turtle (voiced by Steven Wright) keeps trying to talk sense into the frog and surprises everyone when he lives up to his nickname of ""Speed""; and that is just the start of the list!

The first hour is by far my favorite part of this film. The first song happens almost immediately and carries us through the prince & princess growing up and spending summers together with their matchmaking parents throwing them together as often as possible. The villain is pretty scary and can turn into a giant beast who attacks and kills people, but it adds excitement to the film rather than keeps children too scared to see it. There are so many funny situations and so many opportunities to laugh for children and adults alike in the beginning of the film that you simply have to see it for yourself!

909164,5,6304606206,"I'm not too keen on all the sequels done to this, but I LOVE this film! First of all, both of the protagonists are hilarious in their boy v. girl mentality. Forced into marriage by their parents for politics, Derek and Odette despise each other as children and constantly bicker whenever forced to spend time together. Over time the two grow to love each other and that is when fate intervenes. Odette, afraid that Derek only likes her because she's become beautiful, leaves in a huff and is trapped by an evil sorcerer's spell. Hilarious antics involving animal companions and heart-wrenching scenes of Derek nearly murdering Odette's swan self ensue before the breathtaking ending.
Odette is a wonderful girl that little girls will emulate and look up to and Derek is a handsome fellow that little girls will hope to find themselves one day.

909328,3,6304606206,"I watched this with fairly low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  I grew up watching Disney movies, and it seems like when other companies try to pull off a princess movie, it just ends up being a Disney movie wanna-be.  There were some definite Disney-ish qualities to this movie.  In fact, when it first started, I thought, ""It looks like another version of Sleeping Beauty""-the dad longing for many years for a child and finally having a daughter; the betrothal of a young prince and princess, although it's more developed than in Sleeping Beauty; the typical animal sidekicks to provide comic relief; the bad guy turning into a dragon-like creature and the prince coming to the rescue.  It wasn't exactly the same, just had lots of similarities.  The animation was better than I expected, though still not quite up to Disney film standards (I'd say maybe up to Disney direct to DVD standards-maybe slightly better).  As many reviewers have mentioned, the ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" and ""Princesses on Parade"" songs were a bit overdone.  While I actually enjoyed ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" itself, it didn't fit the villian's character or the mood of the moment.  The other thing was that this song and the Princess song didn't really do much to help the story along.  It was more like , ""Oh, it's time for the bad guy to sing now!"" or ""Hey, let's put in a big show-stopping number with all the princesses in it!"" On the other hand, songs like ""This is my Idea"" and ""Far Longer than Forever"" were very enjoyable.  ""This is my Idea"" did a good job of inserting humor, and helped move the story along.  ""Far Longer than Forever"" is very pretty and comparable to many of the classic Disney love songs.  Howard McGillin and Liz Callaway's beautiful voices are amazing.
  I did appreciate the movie's attempt to get the idea across that a romantic couple in an animated movie doesn't have to fall in love at first sight...love is sometimes something you learn after years of knowing someone.  It might have been able to be developed a little more, as some other reviewers have mentioned, but I think they had the right idea.
  One thing I did want to mention is that there are a couple of pretty intense scenes if you have more sensitive little ones.  My girls get scared really easily (they can't even handle the wolf fight in Beauty and the Beast), and they'll be waiting a while to see this.  For one thing, in the battle scene at the end between Prince Derek and Rothbart, Rothbart turns into a pretty scary dragon-like creature, which might be too much for smaller viewers.  Also, at one point in the film, Derek mistakes Odette in her swan form for the villian and tries to kill her.  Once again, if you have sensitive little ones, this might be a little too intense for them.
  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.  It's not a classic, but an enjoyable film nonetheless.",1244592000,3,2876,4.638339920948616

I took one star away for plot gaps, inconsistencies in the character's emotions and overall look.  Princess Odette and Prince Derek fall in love in the first five minutes or so, but then Derek says beauty is all that really attracts him to Odette, so Odette breaks it off.  However, the two are swearing they'll be in love ""for longer than forever"" after Odette get's kidnapped.

I'm super-critical when it comes to costume consistencies.  When Odette leaves Derek's castle, she is wearing a dress that is different from the one we see her in after her kidnapping, even though the two events happened sequencially.  But, that's really not a huge deal and I didn't notice these things as a child, I just remember adoring the story.

My sisters (ages 3 & 4) also really enjoy the movie and they love to sing along and dance, especially to For Longer Than Forever. (And I've even caught my 12-yr.-old brother watching this movie when he thought no one was looking)

909598,5,6304606206,"I'd just like to say that, as a 16 year old, I STILL sit down and watch this movie. As do all of my freinds -we're getting ready to go off to college and wondering how in the world we'll afford DVD players to watch this movie.

The real reason I'm reviewing is because there's a particular review that totally bashes this movie that rather infuriated me. I would like to state here and now that this is a children's movie, and therefore of course it has holes in it. But I've noticed that a lot of things in real life have holes in them as well; nothing is perfect. And I'm also appalled that a mother who watched this movie through to make sure it was all right for her kids even suggested that the evil villain kill Odette and marry her double. Why didn't the villain of Barbie's Swan Lake just kill the Prince instead of bothering to leave him alive? That whole CHILDREN'S MOVIE thing comes to mind...

Personally, I love just about every song in this movie. I find all the characters fun to watch, and no matter how many times I see the film I always forget that Derek's friend gets lost in the forest... I also find it quite charming that for once, a princess doesn't fall in love with the prince IN 10 SECONDS! Oh my gosh, WHAT a concept that Derek and Odette have known each other for YEARS instead of MINUTES and therefore have an actual UNDERSTANDING between one another instead of love based on appearances. I also like that Odette, for all that she loves Derek, originally protests marrying him because he says he loves her only for her beauty. Do I hear a message being sent to audiences? That looks aren't all that matter? Why, yes! And do I hear Derek telling Odette that he loves her ""for her kindness and her courage"" at the end when he's finally able to put it into words? Yes, those are his exact words.

I have seen the Barbie version of Swan Lake, and while it is cute and charming in its own right, I found the Swan Princess much more memorable. And what The Princess and the Pauper had to do with this movie I'm unsure...",1150675200,99,2043,4.301298701298701

909601,4,6304606206,"Even at fourteen, I can still look back and smile as I remember watching this movie a good many times. IT is perfectly safe and absolutely wonderful for young girls around kindergarten; so long as they don't mind the stereotypical prince and princess story.

  Loosly based on ""Swan Lake"", this story is indeed a classic, though the retelling is a bit shaky in places. I understand why ODette dumps Derek in the beginning as he only likes her on the account that she is resonably attractive. HOwever, as soon as she kidnapped by the evil enchanter, she turns from hating Derek to longing for him with what seems to be every moment. Did I miss something here????

  My personnal favorite part, however, would be the music. Yes ""NO More Mister Nice Guy"", and ""PRincesses on Parade"" were very cheep and childish, but the overal score and many other numbers including, ""Far longer than FOrever"" and ""PRactice, Practice, PRactice!"" are very memorable. Even now, when I listen to this, I find myself absentmindedly screaming: ""Weasley, you're a Rabbit!""

PErhaps this has to do with the fact that I am a musician as well...hmmm

  ANyways, randomness aside, this is a great movie for young girls and is good enough for parents to be able to sit through several runs.",1133395200,2,1260,4.764976958525345
909602,5,6304606206,"This, in my opinion, is the best animated movie ever made.  The story is beautiful, the characters are strong (Derek in particular), the music is wonderful, and the animation is awesome!  Odette is the typical princess; blonde, blue-eyed, and kind.  When captured and turned into a swan, she definitely turns into a damsel in distress, but she has a strong personality and isn't afraid of anything or anyone.  Prince Derek is by far the best character.  It seems awful that he insults Odette (accidentally and unknowingly, sadly-typical guy), almost kills her, and then makes a vow to the wrong Odette, but it is so hard not to love him.  His archery skills are also very kick-butt which is cool.  Lord Rogers and Jean-bob are also hilarious.

 The music is very good as well.  ""This Is My Idea"" is so awesome.  I find it totally cool that Odette and Derek hated each other when they were kids and it was fun to see them fighting.  ""Far Longer Then Forever"" is a beautiful song and is every bit comparable to ""A Whole New World"" and all those Disney songs.  Although many people say that the song ""Princesses on Parade"" is an annoying song, I like it a lot and I think it is very catchy.  Side Note-how weird would it be to have an entire ballroom full of girls swooning and actually fainting at the sight of you?

 Okay-the best scenes (no huge spoilers).  By far the best scene was the sequence when Derek was trying to kill Odette in swan form.  This was a very powerful scene.  It also shows Odette's strength, something nice to see from a DID.  It was also cool when Odette chomped up those roses in her swan form.  It's worth watching the movie just to see that.

 Every movie has it's faults, so here are some (although they are not very bad).  As much as I love the ""Far Longer Than Forever"" sequence, Derek and Odette's constant hand gestures got a little weird.  In one part it looked like they were using sign language to convey what they were singing.  The second thing-""No More Mr. Nice Guy"".  This is Rothbart's, the bad-guy, song.  The music was fine, it just wasn't evil enough.  When I heard the line ""I intend to eat their lunches"" I was like ""what?""  I mean, how weird is that?  Personally I don't think putting kick me signs on people and eating people's lunches is very evil.  It needed to be eviler, since he was an evil dude.

 This movie is awesome and I love it to death.  I'm a 15-year-old girl who can't get enough of this movie.  It is a beautifully crafted, simple fairy tale.  I highly recommend this movie.",1112140800,12,2537,4.44880174291939
909603,2,6304606206,"First of all, I'd like to warn you that I love to mock and nitpick at EVERY movie I watch, even the ones I like.  Second of all, I'd like to mention that I DO actually know a little about music, animation/drawing, and writing, so I have the ability to criticize things with a knowledge of what I'm talking about.  OK, here we go:

FIRST: The Music--
  What THE heck.  I have no idea who this person is, much less how to pronounce his name, but I know that he REALLY needed someone like an editor.  He writes music that doesn't fit the situations that they're supposed to be describing.  For example, there's this one shot where we come over a series of waterfalls to a wide view of the evil sorcerer's citadel.  You know, a kind of foreboding setup.  Yet, there's this unfathomably cheerful, light music.  Ooooooookay.  Also, when Odette changes into a swan  (and vice versa), there this rise in the music--and then it gets all peaceful and slightly soppy as you see her other form.  WHAT!?  Oh, and the ""Princesses on Parade"" thing?  Totally pseudo-cheesy-tyypical-bad-Broadway music.  WRONG.  Not to mention the peppy, cutesy, ANNNOYING song ""No Fear""--as they're sneaking into the evil fortress, attempting to steal a map.  It's just not RIGHT.  The one song that I will admit worked was ""This Is My Idea"".  It set up the story well and the characters (though I think that the arguing was played up a little too much to be romantic).

SECOND: The Characters--
  Here, I WILL actually say something good.  Derek was cool and well-developed for a ""Prince Charming"" character.  Odette as a kid was pretty cool, too, but then, as she got to be older, she turned into the usual ""basic DID: Damsel in Distress"".  Not only that, but I thought that she looked like Pocahontas with blonde-dyed hair.  Her voice sounded exceptionally ditzy, even more so than Jasmine from Aladdin (who I think is pretty hard to top).  Speed was actually a bit funny because he sounded so cynical about the whole movie (I can identify with HIM).  Jean-bob was JUST annoying and self-centered; I mean, I would have preferred a soppy ""change of heart""/humiliation by the end to his thinking he was a prince.  And BROM!?  Don't EVEN go there.  He was supposed to be a comic relief, but he was (A) not in the least funny, (B) a fool, (C) a cheat, and (D) a coward.  Everyone else was trying SO hard to be funny that they weren't at all.  The conductor-guy was funny once or twice.

THIRD: The Animation--
  Okay, The effects were good--you know, all the flashes from Rothbart, and Odette changing form--but if you've seen the Black Cauldron (which is SO bad that if I were to take time out from this review to discuss would result in a 200 page essay), it looks like they had animated actors that play parts in EVERY SINGLE DANG MOVIE.  Eilonwy (which they don't pronounce right) looks like Odette, and Taran and Derek-as-a-kid look uncannily alike.  Not to mention that the only well-animated character, whose gestures MAKE SENSE (gasp! A novel idea) is Derek.  HE doesn't do weird, jerking motions with his head and hands quite as often as the other characters, though he does do some.  I think the biggest problem with the animaton as a whole, though, was that they didn't put the sound and animation together until the final copy, so it didn't match up.  I can't tink of any other possible explanation for the horrendous marriage between sound and animation.  What effects animation was good (except Odette's transformation) was ruined by 50's scifi-horror flick sound effects.  What animation was good didn't match the sound at all.  Take the song in the beginning.  Like when she kick over the treehouse.  The voice doesn't match her doing that.  And other mixes of these two problems.

FOURTH (and last): The Story--
  This is the one area where it was really pretty good.  The story is pretty well thought out, and I'm happy with what they did. The one point I'd contend is that the two argued too much as kids, as I mentioned before.  But other than that, good.

Well, I'm done.",1100390400,11,4058,4.6394366197183095

909740,5,6304606206,"Dazzling, colorful animation accompanied by sweetly dulcet music bring this fairy tale to life, which will definitely leave a lasting impression on your mind. Directed by Richard Rich, The Swan Princess tells us the story of a beautiful princess named Odette. Her birth brings great joy to her father King William, who on this occasion betroths her to the heir of the neighboring kingdom, Prince Derek; son of the widowed queen Uberta. The two children are brought together each summer with hopes that they would one day fall in love. This eventually does happen; (though as kids they were always fighting) but when asked by Odette what he sees other than her beauty, Derek fails to proclaim his love for her. Meanwhile the evil enchanter Rothbart, who had been banished from the kingdom, ambushes the king and princess, kills William and kidnaps Odette. She is turned into a swan and changes back to her true form only when the moonlight touches her wings. The spell can alone be broken by a vow of everlasting love from Derek. With the help of her hilarious friends Jean-Bob, the frog and Speed, the turtle; she must prove her true love and defeat Rothbart.

The animation, which consists mostly of hand painted cels, is simply majestic; the backgrounds and characters looking nothing short of spectacular. The movie took three long years in the making and the intense labor of the artists is indeed observed in the stunning visual style of the film.

 The music, by Lex De Azevedo (with lyrics by David Zippel) is brilliantly composed; songs like `This Is My Idea' and' Practice, Practice, Practice' being well-placed and catchy. `Far Longer Than Forever' is matchless in its melody, with its haunting tune and luscious music that touches your heart (it received a Golden Globe nomination for best song in 1994). As to why it did not receive an Oscar nomination is still a big mystery to me, as in every way it is comparable to `A Whole New World' or `Beauty And The Beast'. The end-title solo `Eternity' is beautifully performed by Miwa Yoshida. The score (also by Azevedo) is rich and vibrant, brightly highlighting the emotional sequences in the film.

The portrayal of the characters is done marvelously. Odette is beautiful and kind, her romantic heart making sacrifices for her true love. Prince Derek is handsome, brave and passionate, and he proves his love for Odette in the end. The villain Rothbart, though sometimes a bit scary for younger viewers, provides a strong negative character. The sidekicks, Jean-Bob, Speed and Puffin are hilarious and they bring most of the humorous moments. Derek's mother Uberta, his mentor, Lord Rogers and his cowardly companion, Bromley are wonderfully depicted, their presence adding comic warmth to the movie.

 The voice cast comprises of talented artists. Jack Palance is superb as the dark voice of Rothbart. John Cleese voices Jean-Bob with a peculiar French accent which is simply loveable. Sandy Duncan brings Uberta to life with spasm and liveliness and Steven Wright well portrays the character of Speed. Howard Mcgillin is excellent as the speaking and singing voice of Prince Derek and Michelle Nicastro is the perfect choice for Odette, her voice both warm and gentle.

 Overall, a well done movie, which although does not earn the title of a classic or masterpiece; is yet unique in beauty and offers something for the entire family. It brilliantly conveys the message of love and sacrifice (although I believe that the script could have been developed a little more). Sadly, the DVD of this movie has never been released in the US. I had to import mine from Europe (where it has been officially released by Columbia Tristar video). So if you enjoy spectacular animation and melodious music, this movie will be wonderfully entertaining.

7874909,1,6304606206,"I watched this movie as a kid and thought I enjoyed it. Not till later in life that I now thought that I wanted nothing to do with Swan Princess and its sequels and spin offs. If you're looking for a Swan Lake movie adaptation, this movie franchise is not for you. Watch Barbie of Swan Lake instead. That movie doesn't have any cheesy characters, cheesy musical numbers and alligators/crocodiles. Both Derek's mother and Odette's father insist on spending time together and loving each other even though they both didn't want to. I had to think ""You can't force them to love each other or spend time together. Let them decide for themselves."" After the first movie, Odette keeps turning into a swan in every movie installment despite the spell being broken. The last time I watched the first swan princess movie before I wanted nothing to do with the franchise was in May 2016. At that time, I was so embarrassed.",1522108800,,913,4.6419753086419755
