8039184,4,B0006681TK,"To those who know Hollywood's track record with historical validity, the laughably inaccurate portrayals of Elliot Ness and Al Capone in the Untouchables are par for the course, but of course in tinseltown embellishment is everything and entertainment depends on it!  That said The Scarface Mob is a fast-paced, action-packed, brutally violent extended episode of the T.V. series, and who better to direct this in your face mayhem than the poet of violence Phil Karlson.( Kansas City Confidential,Brothers Rico,and Walking Tall to name but a few of his films)  Karlson directs this film with the same attention to detail and claustrophobic inevitability that he brings to his more realistic films, and the viewer benefits because of this. It is by far the peak of an extremely popular and well done series in which Robert Stack actually makes art out of the stoic, wooden performance and Neville Brand mugs heroically as, in my opinion, the best Capone on film. Oh yeah, an extra tidbit, It was brought to you by Desi and Lucy!!!!",1424044800,,1030,4.982558139534884
