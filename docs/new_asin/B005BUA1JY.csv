4647879,1,B005BUA1JY,"Now that I've spent about $75 for the first three seasons, they want me to spend another $111 to see the rest of the series. I think not.",1311379200,29,137,3.9285714285714284
4647880,5,B005BUA1JY,"Since everyone else is ""reviewing"" a product that doesn't yet exist, I'll also put my two cents in. Since the bulk of the series will be on DVD for the first time, I don't see what the problem is with re-buying the first three seasons. We'll only be doubling up on 57 of 170 episodes. I plan on giving away the first three seasons to friends or family.

Looked at another way, the pre-order price of $111.99 is roughly $22/season for the five ""new"" years in the box. Seems like a fair price to me, and definitely not deserving of the petulant one-star reviews. I, for one, had almost given up hope of ever seeing the rest of this show on DVD and am grateful that Shout! Factory is making it happen.",1311292800,68,698,4.287878787878788
4647881,1,B005BUA1JY,"Agree with the rest of the folks, to only produce a total package now, after already selling seasons 1, 2 and 3, just isn't right, can't rationalize buying it for the remainder, only hope is that they will SEE some of these comments and sell them individually for those that already purchased the earlier ones...:-(

4647882,5,B005BUA1JY,"Barney Miller remains one of the best sitcoms ever to hit American television; almost all of it took place on the single set, yet it was never boring.  Great regular cast, terrific writing, and a hilarious run of perps, victims, and other related characters wandering through the 12th Precinct every week.  It's great that it is FINALLY being offered in its totality.

However, I am in agreement with many of the other reviewers here:  It's frustrating that those of us loyal enough to have already bought the first 3 seasons have to re-buy those seasons if we want seasons 4 through 8.  They should be offering the alternative to purchase the seasons individually.  Perhaps if they see enough negative commentary here and at other websites, the manufacturer will realize that it's better to reward loyalty than to punish it.",1311292800,,825,4.899280575539568
4647883,4,B005BUA1JY,"UPDATE: Because my ""review"" keeps popping up first, here's a real one now. Hope it helps. (I'll leave an edited potion of my original post at the end.)

Got an early Christmas gift this month. Essentially raised on Barney Miller, I had a couple of lost weekends after the complete series landed on my porch. Here's what I got on Shout's treatment of my favorite series....

The First Three Seasons--Unfortunately, Shout! Factory used what Sony created for their season sets; other than the packaging, they're the exact same discs, menus and all. That means the first season still looks woeful and that two of its episodes (Ramon and The Bureaucrat) are the syndicated cuts. However, Shout has included a complete version of Ramon with the extras (Harris in drag!). The video quality of that version is pretty bad, which should indicate the kind of job Shout faced in getting complete episodes. Which brings me to....

Completeness of Episodes--I wish I could say that Seasons 4 to 8 are complete, but one episode--Season 7's Rachel, the one in which Harris is sued for libel for Blood on the Badge--is about 2 minutes short, indicating a syndication cut. Given that Shout managed to find a complete Ramon, it's entirely possible that no complete version of Rachel (or The Bureaucrat) currently exists. The last episode of the series, in fact, comes with a warning because it was taken from the last surviving complete version. But it's still watchable, and while the other episodes do show varying video quality, sometimes even within the same episode, most look as good as or better than you can hope for with a three-decades-old videotaped series. Shout also has avoided the excessive edge enhancement that plagues Seasons 2 and 3. (Note: In the Season 6 episode Inquisition, the word ""Musak"" is silenced out three times at the beginning. Apparently, this was done in the episode's initial run because of trademark issues and that is what remains on the source materials.)

Extras--And this is where the fun begins. Everything's on the last disc. First up is a commentary on Landmark, the three-part series ender, with writer/producers Tony Sheehan, Jeff Stein, and Frank Dungan. Sheehan was show-runner Danny Arnold's right-hand man beginning in the second season and essentially ran Barney Miller after Arnold's on-set heart attack in 1979, while Stein and Dungan were the story editors for the final three seasons. Two great interview featurettes running nearly an hour altogether heavily feature Hal, Abe, and Max, as well as include a 2009 interview with the late, great Steve Landesberg (no Ron? Nuts). Abe Vigoda especially is a joy to listen to; the man bounces around so much in the interview that the focus-puller can't keep up! A third, shorter featurette features Stein and Dungan talking about the show's infamous way of writing episodes. The aforementioned uncut Ramon is here, along with an unannounced extra: a short excerpt from the recent Jack Soo documentary You Don't Know Jack. Season 1 of the spin-off Fish, which I haven't watched yet, is in its own separate slimcase.

But the centerpiece is the long-unseen pilot The Life and Times of Barney Miller. Shot on film and following an earlier version of the Ramon script, the pilot is like meeting childhood friend after he's had plastic surgery. The home movie opening indicates the show's original tone and focus, also implied by the pilot's different story structure (the precinct scenes bookend the episode). What's really interesting is seeing some familiar faces speaking other characters' lines. Two of the pilot's detectives appear in later episodes, played by the same actor: Wilson in Season 1's Experience and Del Vecchio (as a narcotics cop) in Season 2's You Dirty Rat. Fish also is here, but he seems far too lively. Most of all, Abby Dalton as Liz makes you really appreciate Barbara Barrie and the chemistry she had with Hal Linden.

Expectations are hard to meet, but Shout! Factory has made an excellent attempt. The porting over of the Sony discs and the cut Rachel prevents this from being a perfect set, but in the larger picture, I find those minor quibbles. The series has been treated with respect, and from the pilot to the lights going off in the ole one-two, nearly every single minute of Barney Miller is, like Levitt, present and accounted for (even if a little short). If you're a fan of the series, whether you grew up on it like I did or discovered it in syndication or on DVD, you've got every reason pick this up.
--------------
[Written When Set Was Announced in July]

1. This is not a case of a studio releasing a bunch of single season sets then a complete series release to milk more money. Sony released the first three seasons. Shout! Factory is releasing this set because Sony decided *not to release any more seasons.* They did not sell enough to justify doing more, which is the same reason why Night Court has gone to DVD-R releases.

2. Shout! Factory is giving Barney Miller the treatment that Sony never did. [See review]

3. This is not a rip-off. The set retails for $160, which means you're paying less per season (not counting the Fish season) than you would have if you waited and purchased each single set. Given the extras Shout! Factory is adding to the set, that's far, far better than the barebone jobs Sony was sporadically releasing. With Amazon's discounts, it's even better.

Is it irritating that a complete set has come out after three single-season sets? Of course, but that's the risk you take with any series release (just ask any Farscape fan) and I refuse to complain about it and ""protest"" by refusing to buy a perfectly excellent set of a series that has been more or less neglected while other classic 1970s series have been completely released. As a Barney Miller fan, I rejoiced when I saw this set listed. And the first three seasons I own? They'll go to friends who never heard of the series.",1311292800,415,5940,4.849112426035503
4647884,5,B005BUA1JY,"While I am in complete agreement with those who quite rightly object to this blatant rip-off, I also agree with the person who said, again quite rightly, that Barney Miller was one of the best cop shows ever. I disagree slightly. In my opinion, Barney Miller was not only THE best cop show ever, it was also one of the best series on commercial TV ever. I too have been waiting for what seems like forever for the next series to appear. If this were any ordinary show, I would definitely skip it and let the greedy so and sos who inflict this highway robbery on us eat it. Unfortunately, this is Barney Miller - quite simply, THE BEST. So, sigh, I'm going to let myself be had and order the complete series - and hope I live long enough to both receive it and watch it.",1311292800,3,769,4.238095238095238
4647885,5,B005BUA1JY,"There's a lot of confusion in some of the low rated reviews that is based on a lack of information.  No one is pulling bait and switch.  Sony released the first three seasons then stopped.  Shout! Factory has picked up the rights and is releasing this set.  In the past they have also released the remaining seasons in individual season format for shows they picked up like this.

This set, beyond the creative packaging contains:

* All eight seasons on 25 discs
* Newly-produced and never-before-seen bonus features
* 32 page commemorative book
* New interviews with the cast (Linden, Gail, Vigoda)
* Original unaired pilot
* Writers' commentary on select episodes
* Entire first season of Fish (the Abe Vigoda spin-off).

The original news is here: [...]

Amazon is offering this at 30% off!  This is an incredible deal, and beyond the best news fans of Barney Miller could have hoped for.  Emmy- and Gold Globe-winning, hilarious, and still one of the best comedies ever produced, Barney Miller is finally getting the DVD treatment it deserves.",1311292800,145,1048,4.870056497175141
4647886,5,B005BUA1JY,"Sure, you may have already bought the first three seasons on DVD.  But this show ran for eight seasons.  If this set was of only seasons four through eight, wouldn't you pay this price to fill out your collection?  I only hope a similar set is issued for WKRP.",1311292800,8,260,4.26530612244898
4647887,1,B005BUA1JY,"Remember, not so long ago, many of us had slowly collected the first few seasons of Mary Tyler Moore, waiting patiently for the remainder to come? Then, after years of nothing, the ""box set"" came out. Making the first discs we had bought obsolete, and they were seemingly forcing us to re-purchase what we had already bought. Fans howled in protest. Reviews were terrible UNTIL they took care of the loyal customers who had bought the individual seasons, and they released the final seasons individually in addition to the ""box set"".

Now, they are attempting to pull the same ""bait and switch"" with Barney Miller. I don't know how many years it's been since season 3 came out, but I know that I, and many others, have waited way too long for this great show to be available, with the OPTION of purchasing individual seasons.

This is highway robbery. Pure and simple. They do this with the best shows (many agree Barney Miller is one of the greatest cop shows, comedy or drama, in TV history), thinking we'll do anything to purchase it, even re-purchasing perfectly good discs.

They didn't get away with it for MTM, don't let them do it now!",1311292800,68,1143,4.648514851485149
4647888,3,B005BUA1JY,"It's okay...  I'll give it 3 stars because the writing and story lines are good.

I took off 2 stars because the image quality!  Sony's production team didn't take the extra time and effort to digitally remaster the whole series!  It's just awful!  It looks like someone took a VHS copy and recorded it on DVD.

BUYER BEWARE:
Buy with caution.  If you are a Barney Miller fan and want the complete series boxset, then buy it.  If you want crisp clear picture quality and a digitally remastered series, you're not going to get it with this boxset.",1517184000,,546,4.5

4647899,1,B005BUA1JY,"I was writing a very thorough review but accidentally ended up clicking back. So I guess I'll shorten it up this time. This show is AMAZING. Very well made, everything about it is good. However, I bought this because it was advertised as NEW, yet the discs in season 1 (all I've watched so far) have serious SCRATCHES on them, and they are scratches and NOT smudges. Permanent scars. How a brand NEW product can be scratched it beyond me...maybe the seller is complete LIAR and selling used products?...OR the shipping handlers abused it completely. But I can not even watch Episode 4 of season 1, it is completely unplayable due to the scratches on it. Of course I want a refund, but who is gonna wait around for weeks for a refund? Not many...and they know this. That's why they take advantage of people and sell and ship them faulty discs...all I really wanted was to purchase this series for a whopping $85+ and enjoy it, but they still felt the need to rip me off...even after all the money I paid. Btw this was shipped from eBay. I am DISSAPPOINTED and UPSET about the quality of these so called ""NEW"" DVD's. I submitted photos of disc two, season 1 because disc 1 season 1 is currently in my ps3 and completely FROZEN... This seller either is an inconsiderate LIAR or their delivery handlers are complete jerks...

UPDATE: The first 2 discs of season 5 have absolutely no function whatsoever. They are scratch free, very clean, but completely unreadable by both my DVD player and my PS3. I am very disappointed because this is a very good season. I'll update for MORE screwups with this so called ""NEW"" box set further.",1507680000,2,1626,4.568493150684931

4647905,5,B005BUA1JY,"I purchased this complete set...my first order had a defective DVD (S1) of which Amazon promptly exchanged the entire set. I recently completed viewing the entire collection. I LOVE this show...it takes me STRAIGHT BACK to my high school days and my HUGE crush on Sargeant Detective Ronald Nathan Harris (of whom I first saw the handsome and articulate Ron Glass on the Pyramid Game Show in 1977 and thanks to Dick Clark's plug of BARNEY MILLER I tuned into the summer re-runs and have been hooked ever since!) Even in my teens I liked the ensemble cast of the different cultures aka 'melting pot' of the detectives in the squad room headed by Captain Barney Miller (Hal Linden-another handsome gentleman as well!) It was cleverly written and the talented actors/actresses made this show one the best on television. One character I grew to appreciate now that I am 'Golden Gal' age is Sgt. Philip K. Fish. His demeanor of the 'tired but experienced' cop coupled with his humorous mannerisms and lines make me laugh out loud...with this said, I also am now enjoying the extra added first season of ""Fish"". I also enjoyed Abe Vigoda's comments in the bonus information included on the final DVD of S8.

4647909,1,B005BUA1JY,"Here, unfortunately is a package of assorted defective discs---a shame for the great series ""Barney Miller.""  I have only watched up through Season 5 but have encountered 5 or 6 discs that 3 different brand DVD players cannot handle.  The bad discs have shown up in Season 2,3 and 5.  When I say ""bad,"" I mean BAD.  They cause the players not only to skip, freeze and jump, but worse cause a chattering sound from the mechanism, as if the player was on the verge of a breakdown. (Update: The defective discs continue--both Season 6 and 7 have at least one bad disc per 3. Season 8: all 3 were bad.  It was especially disgusting when disc 3 froze and skipped throughout the ""Bonus Features.""  It's  ridiculous having to buy replacement sets for every season.)  I think the ""Shout"" company should issue a recall of all these series and play every disc on an average quality DVD player.  To get the properly working discs into my collection, I had to buy separate season discs (Seasons 2 and 3 fortunately were put out by some other company than ""Shout."")  Yes I feel like ""shouting"": Crummy, blasted discs. Shame on you, Shout.  If you must have this great program, I would recommend purchasing one season at a time, not the complete series packaged as one.  The reason: Amazon fulfills the separate seasons, so if you get a bad disc, it will be 100 times easier to get a direct replacement at no extra cost to you.",1496361600,2,1413,4.519685039370079

I know that Shout Factory is a reputable company and I guess they would have used the complete episodes for this set if they were available but apparently those edited-out minutes went to the cutting-room floor, never to be seen again. In a show like ""Barney Miller"", where every line is vital, you just can't do that. Example: in the episode where Dorsey first joins the squad, Wojo's line ""he thinks we're on the take!"" has been removed, making the plot confusing.

4647945,5,B005BUA1JY,"I loved this show when it was originally broadcast, and now, almost 40 years later, it is just as good as before. Both hilarious and poignant. I hadn't realized how many episodes I had not seen before until I worked my way through the entire series.

One thing I really loved about ""Barney Miller"" is that the producers cast a huge number of then-well-known character actors in the secondary parts, including both victims and perps. Some actors returned as several different characters over the years. In what I have to call an unexpectedly grand gesture, the writers found a way to bring back most if not all of those folks in the series two-part finale. What a class act!

The only thing disappointing has to do with the inclusion of season one of ""Fish,"" the spin off series starring Abe Vigoda. The show itself, while not as good as ""Barney Miller,"" is not the problem. ""Fish"" only lasted two seasons. So why include only the first season in this package? Why not both? Realistically, I don't think many people would pay for the second season, so why not include it with this? Just thinking through the keyboard, so to speak.",1471651200,,1129,4.64
4647946,5,B005BUA1JY,"The show is still flawless... wish I could say the same about the manufacturer's quality control -- had to return the entire package because the disc in Season 5 with the memorial to Jack Soo was defective.  The bonus features,  limited as they were, have wonderful memories attached, AND include the first 2 previously unseen pilot episodes -- loved every second of it.  Of course, Abe Vigoda's ""Fish"" series was a nice treat too.  40 years later, the topics are still relevant,  and we'll never have that level of quality performances and writing within a 30 minute sitcom again... Many thanks and blessings to those who brought it to us.",1471392000,,640,4.781818181818182

4648027,5,B005BUA1JY,"I love the Barney Miller show I will wear out the disks LOL
""Barney Miller"" showed the gritty realism of police work in New York City in the 1970s, albeit with humor. Skits about the impending bankruptcy of the city, some of the futile criminal behavior (man stuck inside duct work trying to burglarize a store), the mundane day in, day out existence of police officers with the occasional heart-pounding, adrenalin rush of excitement, and of course, what we in the profession called ""the hair-bags"" - the old cops, forever full of stories, content to live in the past as Inspector Luger exemplifies. To those who say ""Barney Miller"" is dated, I say the show is a timeless slice of life, and can be set in almost any locale and time period. The cast could not have been picked with any more brilliance, and the production was seamless. I say ""Barney Miller"" is a classic for the generations.",1429833600,5,891,4.6455696202531644

sold and everyone was stationed else where.
The original cast lost 3 members, one left, one had to retire, and
sad to say the last one, passed away in real life, RIP Jack Soo.
The show covered issues back in the 70's and 80's, that lo and
be hold, we are still seeing today.....
Yes, it indeed is true.
Issues such as Nuclear Arms, bombs, terrorists, China, Iran, Russia, gun
control, food shortage, water supplies, homeless, politics, gay right issues,
money and banking failures, disease control, FBI and CIA snooping, Vet
issues, UFO's, race and gender issues........and on and on.
But.......they were all dealt with in a light funny way.
So, step back in time, and take a look at the 70's and 80's and what the Police
had to deal with then, and ask yourself.......
Have things really changed that much in the last 30 to 40 years.

Most popular, apparently with male cop-program fans, when it was on the air, I didn't see any of until it was in rerun.  I bought one of the first season boxes because it was on sale, and got hooked on the show. I bought the other two individually packed seasons, and then, no others followed. Eventually, I found a 'supposed' complete set on Amazon Marketplace, but it turned out to be a collection of dvrs culled, illegally, by someone from TV LAND. It came from the Far East somewhere and was not really acceptable. But it was all I could get, so i kept it.  Eventually, it came out in pristine, legal form from SHOUT, which has done the same kind of job on a lot of other tv series that were abandoned by their original distributors.

4648145,5,B005BUA1JY,"This 1975-82 ABC police comedy starring Hal Linden is much funnier than Hogan's Heroes or McHale's Navy. The title track has helped immensely too in my enjoyment.

Know what else helps? The way this release is packaged. Many complete releases are packed with each disc in a separate cardboard holder (like M*A*S*H for instance). With M*A*S*H, all 36 discs of that one were in cardboard sleeves that wore deep scratches on the discs (and as such, there have been many justified complaints about how the discs were unwatchable because of the scratches). This Barney release does not do that; the 25 discs (23 for the 8 seasons, and 2 for the first season of Fish) are in 5 slipcases (one with 5 for Nos. 1-2, three more with 6 apiece for Nos. 3-8, and one with 2 for Fish). All 5 cases are in a sturdy gloss box that is meant to represent Barney's office door. There is even a booklet inside labeled ""Squad Room: Detectives"" that has a tribute and episode guide.

All in all, through the first season and into #2 (I'm planning on seeing it all over time), I think that I may have found a sitcom that is actually funny and that I am really enjoying.",1405123200,8,1146,4.4523809523809526

4648175,5,B005BUA1JY,"Interesting story on this one. When I saw that I could get the package set of the entire series, I got onto Amazon as fast as I could, read the information, and it did NOT say that it had closed captions. So, I didn't order it. At a later date, I decided to buy it for my son, who is not hearing impaired. When it came to the house, I opened it to remove the price info, and saw that ""CC"" on the box. I put the first disk in, and sure enough, there was that beautiful closed captions. So I ordered a second boxed set for my son. This is what gets me, how many other shows that I really wanted, did I refrain from ordering because it did not say that it had closed captions? Why? Why in the world would they not put that. Are these people not aware of the high percentage of hearing impaired people there are in the world right now? I don't get it.",1402790400,4,847,3.9590643274853803
4648176,5,B005BUA1JY,"I love classic television.  Everything from westerns to the old cop shows and even some cartoons.  Barney Miller was one of those shows that was unique.  It was a half-hour comedy that was also a cop show.  Sure, there have (and still are) a lot of those but this series had something that none of the others did.  This series wasn't afraid to tackle tough subjects along with making you laugh.

One of the finest episodes is the first season finale ""The Hero"".  In this episode, Sergeant Miguel ""Chano"" Amangual (Gregory Sierra) kills two bank robbers.  In most cop shows this would be handled one of two ways:  the detective would take the ""they were just two criminals"" attitude or he wouldn't give it a seconds thought because it was part of his job and move on.  Not Chano.  It was the first time he had ever shot anyone in the line of duty and he felt it.  Despite being applauded for his actions by Inspector Luger (James Gregory), Chano isn't pleased.  Comforting and understanding Captain Miller (Hal Linden) even visits Chano at home to try and make him feel better.  Chano puts on the brave face until Barney leaves then breaks down in tears.  That's an incredibly powerful and moving scene--especially for a show that is a comedy.  Even police dramas of the day didn't focus on the impact of a police shooting to the officer in a realistic way.  Not many modern police dramas have, for that matter.

When the brilliant Jack Soo (Sergeant Nick Yemana) passed away on January 11, 1979, Barney Miller did something extraordinary.  Rather than just putting up a dedication message at the end of an episode, the sitcom dedicated an entire episode to Jack Soo.  The actors broke character and were no longer Barney Miller, Ron Harris or Stan Wojciehowicz.  They were Hal Linden, Ron Glass and Max Gail.  They were Jack Soo's friends and co-workers.  They shared their favorite Yemana moments and, when the half hour was finished, raise their coffee cups in a final salute to their beloved friend.  It was an emotionally charged half hour that broke your heart and made you smile as you remembered just how great Jack Soo was at his job.

Departures such as this set Barney Miller apart from others shows of its day and shows since.  You saw the human side of the detectives working the run-down, and often crazy, 12th Precinct.  You saw them for all their strengths, weaknesses and many flaws.  You were introduced to their families and even got to say a heartfelt goodbye to them.  You are introduced to some of the extremely colorful characters the 12th Precinct Detectives come in contact with every day and, some of them, you get to see more than once.  You loved the characters for how human they were.  Sometimes they made you laugh, sometimes they made you cry but they always entertained you.

In this set you have all eight seasons of this amazing and ground-breaking show.  There are four cases each containing two seasons.  The first season of the 1977 spin-off ""Fish"" is also included as a two disc set bringing the final DVD total of this set to 25.  There is a wonderful 39-page booklet included with the set that not only gives you a complete episode guide but has a wonderful 5-page ""Salute to Barney Miller"" essay by Howard Rosenberg with a comment by award-winning author and former LAPD Detective Sergeant Joseph Wambaugh.

This set is very well worth the price and is something that should be part of any television enthusiasts collection.  The packaging is sturdy and the cases make accessing the DVD's easy and protects them from potential damage.  If you enjoy great comedy that is sometimes off-the-wall but always funny, you shouldn't pass this complete series package up.  Buy it, pop the corn, chill the soda, order or bake a pizza and kick back, relax and let the personalities of the 12th Precinct take you away from whatever might be getting you down.  You'll be glad you did.",1402617600,,3912,4.687224669603524

It's a lot more realistic portrayal of precinct life than almost all other cop shows. Image resolution is a little poor, but we have gotten used to it.  The lines are well-written and delivered completely in character.  Too bad the industry felt the need to use laugh tracks.  This doesn't need one but we have learned to tune it out.

4648220,5,B005BUA1JY,"There is always confusion over the number of episodes of a series. What is counted by DVD makers and other are original broadcasts not episodes.  Hour-long broadcasts (not episodes) are counted as one episode when it is actually two.  There were two hour-long broadcasts in the fifth season: ""Kidnapping"" and ""Wojo's Girl.""  Both should be counted as a two-part episode, that is, two episodes.  ""Wojo's Girl"" Part 2 is actually a pilot episode for a Max Gail series that didn't sell.  Only the Wojo storyline continued into Part 2 and no other regular actor was seen in that episode.  So there are actually 170 episodes of Barney Miller (plus the original pilot which was never broadcast with the series). Any other number count (such as 168) is wrong.",1397520000,,752,4.8359375

4648224,5,B005BUA1JY,The first three seasons were uniformly good; Season Four had some slippage; I missed Jack Soo with his deadpan humor in the last season. Did get tired of Abe Vigoda and his bathroom and wife problems; glad to see him depart the show. Also happy to see that Harris was able to finally sell his book even though he spent time writing it while he was supposed to be a full-time detective in the 12th precinct. (He sure knows how to wear his clothes.) Arthur Dietrich with his savant knowledge of trivia was hilarious; the writers allowed Leavitt to actually progress from repulsive to being a little bit more likable by the end of the show. Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys humor without swearing or vulgarity.,1394236800,,716,4.6015625

4648237,5,B005BUA1JY,"I have been watching this almost every night since receiving the package a few days ago.  This was one of my favorite programs in the 1970s when I was in my late teens, and now the humor is more poignant, the story line and the topics of concern are just as topical today as they were when the series was filmed.  ""Barney Miller"" had so many talented actors and writers who all went on to do wonderful things.  It is a little melancholy at times to watch James Gregory, Jack Soo and Steve Landesberg and know that they are no longer with us.  However, they left such a wonderful body of work for generations to enjoy.",1392681600,,617,4.293103448275862

The cast was incomparable, the characterizations of the police officers and the people they encounter were spot on.  The dialog was great.  If you only saw a few episodes it would be worth your time to get this and treasure it.  Compared to the junk that passes for comedy on television now, this could be a tutorial for writers or producers who think they know what's funny.",1392595200,3,443,4.432098765432099

4648240,5,B005BUA1JY,"/Barney Miller/ never had the large following of some other shows, and that's a pity.  But those of us who liked it, liked it a lot.  It was a ""smart comedy"", where much of the humor was in the wordplay between the characters, with next to no physical comedy.  The main characters were all funny in their different ways, without ever degenerating into one-note cardboard cutouts.  The writing was very natural, the way people actually speak, but funny.  Yes, there's a laugh track, but you wouldn't know because it's used only where a real audience would laugh.  There were both entertaining recurring characters and lots of guest stars, some of whom went on to become big names.

I had bought seasons 1, 2, and 3 when they were released _very_ slowly, and after several years with no season 4 I had despaired of ever seeing the rest of this classic.  When this came available at about a hundred bucks for 23 discs, I jumped at it and gave my season sets to my brother.  I haven't regretted the purchase for a moment.

The box is a cute idea, and has shown no signs of wear in the year-plus it's been taken off the shelf and put back. .  Each season is on three discs (two for the short season 1), and there's a booklet with brief episode descriptions to help you find your favorites.  Video quality is very good considering the original recordings were analog and made 30 years ago.

There are no episode commentaries or blooper reels or anything like that.  There is one recent interview with some of the cast members.  There _are_ some DVDs of the spinoff series /Fish/, which I have not watched because I remember the reviews when it aired.

My favorite episodes: ""Werewolf"" and ""Computer Crime"" come to mind, but really my favorite episode is the one I'm watching at the moment when you ask me.",1390435200,4,1799,4.540372670807454

4648246,5,B005BUA1JY,"Barney Miller may have been the best television comedy show EVER.  Notice, I did not say sit-com because that, more often than not, denotes an insipid, full of laughter and little else, program.  Barney Miller managed to put together shows which had laughter, tears, social relevance, traumatic events and camraderie which left you with ideas to think about...not just laugh and then forget.  It was about the building of a team through friendships and hardships; good times and bad times; people you'd live with and people you'd die for.  Television comedies have nothing like this today...nothing like this or Maude or All in the Family which were able to tackle pertinent social issues with both laughter and tears.

Sure, some of the episodes look a little rough, but given the limitations of being shot on video, plus the fact that these were not re-mastered I can live with it. I'm honestly just delighted to have the entire series in my collection now. As a bonus they even throw in the first season of Fish, too! Great! Cannot beat that. Sure, it sucks that I bought the first three seasons individually, but it's really Sony's fault for being a bunch of lazy buttwipes by not finishing what they started. God bless Shout! Factory for picking up the ball and running all the way for the touchdown with this complete Barney Miller collection! If you're a fan of the guys from 12th Precinct and haven't bought this yet, or you've never seen the show but are curious... then by all means get it! You will not be disappointed.

My father in law has a great sense of humor but a damaged sense of hearing.  This has allowed him access to an old favorite feel-good show.  Watching him with his silent laughter as he laps up (and is even re-watching already just  because he's enjoying it so - and he hasn't even been through the whole set once yet!) episodes is double fun for me.  One of the best gifts we've ever gotten him - well worth the money.  All the episodes I've seen so far have been of good recording quality (I haven't seen the whole set, myself, yet) and the ones I've watched had a good job on the CC (sometimes that is not the case so I was pleased to find it well done on this as the great script writing is such an important part of the whole feel of Barney Miller).",1386979200,3,897,4.1502890173410405

Its really too bad they don't have shows on tv like BARNEY MILLER today instead of upteen reality shows.

Naturally, when I returned home my mailbox was full of mail. And my order was returned to sender. I sent an e-mail to the seller to re-send the package once it was returned to them. They didn't actually reply to my e-mail, but obviously they did something so that my order appeared on my front porch yesterday.

4648318,5,B005BUA1JY,"I've read that Barney Miller's appeal was limited to a select audience -- mostly guys in police, fire and military work -- but this female viewer loved it too and did so from the start. So what if it had predominately male characters, very few (and mostly unattractive) women, and almost never left its dingy squad room set? This award-winning TV series also had terrific writing; a pitch-perfect cast playing ""real"" detectives who guzzled bad coffee and did a lot more paperwork than stakeouts; a slew of old-pro character actors who played the quirky victims and perps they processed; and cool-jazz title and credit tracks I never got tired of listening to. It was street-smart and funny as hell -- and (surprise!) it never got cancelled. The series ended on its own, before any shark-jumping ruined it.

Barney Miller still holds up well. Having just watched all eight seasons, I see how prescient the series was in addressing issues like the environment, city politics and budget cuts, hiring women for the job and getting promotions. It was also unusually daring in featuring stories about race, gender and religious discrimination; the homeless and street people; cops' relationships with prostitutes; sexual orientation (BM writers consulted with a gay support group to create its recurring gay characters; and people with disabilities. It was comedy with a conscience.

I'm glad I got this handsome box set edition. It includes all eight seasons; the first and only season of Fish (the spin-off series for Abe Vigoda's character); a descriptive booklet about the series and title listings; and a bonus DVD featuring the main writers and most of the cast in recent interviews, and the original pilot. The writers also narrate commentary tracks for the last three episodes of the show. The video images and audio are in decent shape. The DVDs are packaged in plastic jewel box cases (unlike M*A*S*H with those awful disc-damaging cardboard slots). IMO the extras alone are worth the price, which isn't outrageous.

So if like me, you've missed the ole one-two for decades, put your peg back in the roster board with this box set. ""Okay, you and Wojo take the call...""",1374969600,12,2173,4.997237569060774

4648344,5,B005BUA1JY,"Yes I have given 5 stars to Night Court as i would to Big Bang but for me and probably millions of others
BM is not only the greatest comedy of all time but it will never be surpassed. This is a SIX star series.
BM was the first TV Series to be filmed in front of a LIVE audience so the laughter you hear is genuine.
Whilst BM did not start on full throttle it was still good and kept on increasing in quality and laughs.
BM also was the first show to truly challenge the critics and audience. The Cast was multi-national.
There is not room here to cover each member as they deserve but Landesberg was probably
the first true intellectual of comedy and Ron Glass the first black dude who was equal to any white dude.
BM never shied away from any issue many of which are still pertinent today.
A big plus is the never-ending line up of guests as convicts which proved as entertaining as any show
I can recall.
Even when there are serious issues so that BM pulls the heartstrings this in no way reduces the pleasure.
And yes, I have watched this series twice and will continue to watch for as long as i live.
BM deserves to live forever.

4648367,5,B005BUA1JY,"When I discovered that ""BARNEY MILLER: THE COMPLETE SERIES"" was available, I didn't hesitate one second in placing
an order. I grew up watching this show. This was when real actors and writers were creating TV history. Their shows were
well written and performed by the cast. A far cry from today's over saturated ""reality"" shows, which are nothing more than useless and brainless shows surrounding talentless ""personalities"" and over exagerated ""situations"" suggested and
introduced by weak scripts, if any.

Now, when my wife and I want to watch some real comedy show, we pick one DVD from the collection and enter the world of intelligent comedy.

The 25-DVD collection is worth every penny. The DVDs are stored in DVD cases. The DVD cases in turn are stored it in a beautiful slip case. The 40-page booklet is very helpful because it gives a brief summary about each episode.

A great bonus is the addition of the first season of ""FISH""",1361318400,,940,4.826086956521739

4648371,5,B005BUA1JY,"Anyone who is a fan of this classic TV show shouldn't hesitate to purchase this DVD collection.  No matter what the video and audio quality grades are that one may assign this item, it doesn't change the fact that it is very unlikely that another `digitally enhanced' or `high definition' version of this series will ever be released.  Most distributors and studios are decreasing the amount of physical videos made each year as they turn their attention to streaming internet content.  The bottom line is this is a solid DVD collection and should satisfy fans of this outstanding comedy series.  [ Note the special features include a couple of good retrospective documentaries and season 1 of the spin-off `Fish' (which is below average, but will appeal to viewers seeking family-friendly entertainment). ]

TECHNICAL GRADES:
  Season 1:  This season needs substantial remastering as the video goes back and forth between levels of clarity.
  [ Video:  D+;  Audio:  C ]
  Seasons 2-3:  These two seasons surprisingly have the best video quality in this set.  Clarity does vary episode to episode, however.  [ Video:  B;  Audio:  B ]
  Season 4:  Uneven clarity all season long.  [ Video: C-;  Audio:  C ]
  Seasons 5-6, 8:  These seasons have consistent video quality, except for occasional tint issues.
  [ Video:  B-;  Audio:  B- ]
  Season 7:  While it has decent video quality, the audio experiences some inconsistencies on a few episodes.
  [ Video:  B-;  Audio:  C+ ]

SERIES REVIEW:
  Season 1-3:  The first three seasons are really the glory period for this show.  Sgt. Chano's energy was an underrated component and it is a shame the producers were not able to keep actor Gregory Sierra on the show.  It is no accident that the best episode of `Barney Miller' called ""The Hero"" features Chano.  The original cast chemistry was wonderful and sadly never equaled in the latter seasons.
  Season 4:  The show is clearly in transition as the same running gags are found on episode after episode.  Also, the departures of actors Abe Vigoda and Gregory Sierra are painfully noticeable as Steve Landesberg and Ron Carey's characters are not able to hold their own this season.  It wasn't a good idea to have three droll and dry witted characters on at the same time (namely Yemana, Dietrich & Levitt).  One of the lesser seasons to be sure.
  Season 5:  The series returns to top form as social issues are tackled in frank yet humorous manner.  Actor Ron Glass is given more to do and he rises to the task.  Sgt. Dietrich loses his stoic posture and reveals that he is quite the passionate progressive.  After seasons 3 & 4, one is happy to see actor Steve Landesberg passionate about anything!  The last great season of this show.
  Season 6:  Another solid season that is memorable for giving Officer Levitt finally something more to do than suck up to everyone.  Unfortunately, the worst `Barney Miller' episode (""Uniform Days"") appears this season.  Sgt. Harris crosses the line with Barney in a manner that is neither humorous nor realistic.  However that episode, for better or worse, begins a two season long story arch that takes Harris to some dark places.  Actor Hal Linden is terrific in the season finale, ""Fog.""
  Season 7:  A mean spirited tone permeates throughout the worst season of `Barney Miller.'  This declaration doesn't change the fact that it is still good overall - just simply the least of the eight seasons.  A real surprise that two of the best episodes this season feature Officer Levitt (namely ""Field Associate"" & ""Stormy Weather"").  Oddly, actors Max Gail and Steve Landesberg have diminished roles as Ron Glass and Ron Carey are frequently center stage this season.  This is probably due to the writers' challenge of creating stories in what is essentially a two-set sitcom.  Wojo was featured often in seasons 1 through 5, while Dietrich was featured often in seasons 4 through 6.  So, in the writers' minds, Harris and Levitt were obviously viewed as characters ripe for exploration.
  Season 8:  This season is a fitting close to a great show that was able to mix satire, farce and social commentary into an endearing dish of comedy.  While Hal Linden playing the straight man to his wacky associates goes unnoticed at times throughout eight seasons, it must be said that this show wouldn't have worked without him.  From seasons 5 to 8, it is incredible the number of the same supporting actors that appear in multiple episodes.  The producers apparently used the same veteran actors they could rely on that didn't mind the long shooting schedules.  Season 8 does try to return the show to its roots by focusing more on adventures at the precinct and less on the detectives' personal lives.  (See ""Examination Day"" & ""The Clown"" for episodes reminiscent of the early seasons.)  This back-to-basics approach is a welcome change after the much darker season 7.

4648390,5,B005BUA1JY,A very high quality series of shows to review in the evening for a couple in their 80's Much better than what is available on TV.,1357257600,,129,4.0
4648391,5,B005BUA1JY,"Ok so many people have already told you how great the BARNEY MILLER series was and they are ALL ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!  Barney Miller just had a sense of realism to it because; none of the cops were anything other than good men and occasional ladies trying to protect and serve all of New York City's odd ball citizens.  I see reading some reviews that a few people are upset or feel ill used because; the boxed set includes the first three seasons that schlub's like me brought.  Yeah I brought the first three seasons soon as they were available so I paid dearly for each one. If I had it to do again I'd buy each of the first three seasons again!!!!  I truly loved Barney Miller especially the gentleman who felt he was a werewolf.  The sporadically recurring two gay effeminate felons was also a hoot as well!  My favorite quote was when one of the two gay gent's told a hardened felon type locked in the cell with them, ""I have candy up at my place!""

However lets get back to the people who feel bad for buying the first three individual series box sets.  Why don't I feel ill used you might ask.  I brought the first three seasons and I had them years earlier to enjoy before this complete series set was released.  I figure that the sales of the first three seasons did not gross the kind of money needed to make it profitable for a main line media company to release.  So the release was farmed out to a small quality outfit that had smaller overhead.  A smaller overhead means that smaller sales numbers brings a profit faster when your production costs are much less.  The price for the overall Barney Miller Set is not unrealistic when you compare it to the truly outrageous prices sought by Paramount Studios for almost anything it sells. All eight seasons for Barney Miller while not a steal is a value especially if you truly love the unique Barney Miller Comedy team.  As an black autistic man I was never a big fan of police officers growing up.  Watching Barney Miller taught me a grudging respect for the finer true officers of the law who try to treat citizens with respect.

Also the opening or intro music on some of the DVD's has been jazzed up a bit.  The original Barney Miller theme had a more laid back blues feeling to it that is gone in the new openings.  Again some Barney Miller purists might be miffed.  Some may say the repackaging went too far.  Unfortunately many times the original music is owned or co-owned by others who might want wild amounts of money to use ""their original version of the Barney Miller Theme Music!""  Paying super inflated prices for original music would add cost to the final price of the DVD's so rightly to contain costs new music is used.  Yeah it might make some Barney Miller purist's mad because; the original music is gone BUT, you get to enjoy all the Barney Miller episodes in their original glory.  As Lt Detrick would say or maybe not.  Anyway you slice it, I'm just glad to have the entire Barney Miller Series on DVD uncut and of good basic video quality.  Life is about compromises you can live with.  This Barney Miller Complete series is a compromise I'll gladly live with and LOVE IT!

Best of all Barney Miller taught me with laughter.  Barney Miller was one of the true joys of my childhood years and having all 8 seasons to watch will make me feel like an old dear friend has come home to visit me, I can't remember a time when $99.00 brought me so much joy!

HOW much money I saved.
Sometimes you just have to keep your stuff in your AMAZON [saved] SHOPPING BASKET until Amazon (God bless 'em!) tells you, them-
selves, it is time to buy.
Nay-sayers will tell you that this series isn't in pristine HD quality resolution. Maybe. I've seen better, but t=h=i=s series was, always,
a low-budget-beauty that was --- mostly --- filmed on one set in one particular room. Waddiya wanna SEE ""Fish"" in the ""terlet"" ON the
crapper?
Great show; great cast; great writers; great performances. The rest of the story is that this was a ""work horse"" program that had a niche
with policemen, New-Yorkers, the military, and people that wanted to do one -- or the other -- but watched COPS ON TV instead.

Great show. If today's price is too much --- you CANNOT buy e-v-e-r-y season seperately: You either settle for the first three seasons...
or you buy them all.

4648410,5,B005BUA1JY,"I'm not going to add much more to what others have said about this classic tv series. I had been looking for quite some time to find a COMPLETE Barney Miller box set. I found this DVD collection on Amazon and purchased it for a pretty reasonable price. This series like MASH, Taxi, All in the Family, Bob Newhart, etc was created during an era of groundbreaking and exceptional tv entertainment. What made these shows great was the writing and character development. Barney Miller is arguably one of the best (and possibly under-rated) sitcoms ever produced for television. What made it different from other cop shows was that it depicted more of the every day reality of police work rather than the usual, shoot-'em up, and ""glamorous"" portrayal of police officers/detectives that you see on the majority of cop shows. So far, I have watched about a half a dozen episodes. As another reviewer wrote, the picture quality (and sound) is pretty decent for a tv show from the 1970's considering that it was videotaped. I am a very happy customer. Hats off to Shout! Factory for giving this show its proper due.",1347667200,4,1107,4.740932642487047

4648426,5,B005BUA1JY,"WOW! Are you kidding! The complete series! I was not going to purchase this set based on the reviews that others were giving. However, when the price dropped down to $71.99, that was what I needed to take a chance. I am glad I did. Yes, it is crummy that Sony dropped the ball and left all of the fans hanging by not continuing the series (I have the first three seasons, also!), but, this is a great set! Don't let the nay-sayers scare you from buying this set. It has lots of extras and it is excitng to watch and reminice (sp? who cares, u no whutImeen!) about how old you were when you saw that particular episode or who you were with or... well, you get the idea, right?

4648429,5,B005BUA1JY,"One of my all-time faves, and seeing this has increased my appreciation of this vastly underrated series. Well-made, wonderfully politically-incorrect and the storylines would be as relevant today as they were 30-40 years ago. I also like the behind-the-scenes extras and the interviews with Hal Linden, Abe Vigoda, Max Gail, and the producers. I was somewhat disappointed that Ron Glass wasn't available to reminisce on the series, and I know Mr. Glass is still alive. And I completely forgot that there was a Fish spinoff; seeing that made me know why that series bombed, but given Fish's popularity I couldn't blame them for attempting that spinoff.",1333843200,9,652,5.160377358490566

4648435,5,B005BUA1JY,"First, in praise of Barney Miller.  What I appreciated most was the respect it had for the intelligence and sensibilities of its audience.  And not once did it try for a mean-spirited laugh by putting someone down.

Second, there IS something missing from the boxed set. I have only a 30-some year old memory to go on but I am certain there was a scene in which Levitt was taking a statement from a midget arrested for something petty.  At one point the midget says to Levitt, ""That's easy for you big guys.""  Levitt is momentarily taken aback but then swells with self-esteem. I didn't encounter that scene when I watched all of the disks in the set. And I searched the web in vain for confirmation of this memory. Perhaps someone else will recall that scene.

I still laugh out loud after all these years and as many times as I've seen each episode. I watch ""Barney"" every night on my laptop on the couch. I am keeping my first three episodes knowing I might wear the DVD's out. That is how much I love the show. There can never be another group of actors that was so well put together.

We marvel at man's displayed greed, ignorance, naivete, foolishness and downright occasional stupidity while rejoicing at the compassion and willingness to forgive extended by some of the characters. Various Detectives, Captain Miller, especially, deliver many words of wisdom that give the show substance as well as entertainment value.

4648448,5,B005BUA1JY,"""Barney Miller"" (with Hal Linden, Barbara Barrie, Abe Vigoda, Ron Glass, Max Gail and countless others) premiered in January of 1975 and ran for eight seasons. It remains one of the few half hour sit-coms that takes place in a police station. The set is simple- like ""All In The Family""- and the writing is superior. We find ourselves laughing at the continuous parade of criminals who come through the 12th precinct, which is located acorss the street from McDougall Alley in Greenwhich Villlage. The writers make us laugh but also manage to give us much to think about.
  It's amazing to see the difference in the world in the late 70's to now. To begin with, crime is different. The issues with which they deal are very different than today. The New York they live in is very different from today; New York City was a filthy garbage can in 1976 and we're constanly reminded of this. Now, of course, it is poossible to swim in Long Island Sound. It's been decade4s since raw sewage washed up on the shores and of course, the threat of nuclear war has changed to the threatr of buiological warfare or- God forbid- another tragedy such as Nine- Eleven.
  The cast is top notch and in some, we have veteran actors (Hal Linden, Abe Vigoda, Barbara Barrie) with a lot of stage experience (Barrie was still riding high from her performance in Sondheim and Furth's world changing musical, ""Company"") while actors such as Linda Lavin, who would go on to win multiple Tony Awards, Emmy Awards and be considered a golden property on the Broadway stage, can be seen in guest roles, young and gifted. Max Gail is a brilliant actor-still working strongly today. Ron Glass has plahyed every part from this one to a space traveling shepard for Joss Weadon. Doris Roberts makes an appearance.
  Some of the views are archane: homosexuality is seen as a condition, but at least they address it and they do so with respect Women's rights are evident. Mandeatroy retirement looms constantly at only age 62, and there are far too many jokes about Sgt Yamana, the Japanese-American born in Omaha. The bigots are dealt with by making their characters fools. I like it.
  The 12th precinct is ehtnically blanced, Linden does a wonderful job leading his team while showing compassion and being a good husband and father. (We see his home only during the pilot, which is one of the finest sit-com pilots I've ever seen) and we see this man, accept what he must while loving those around him.
  The entire series is available for less than ninety bucks and it includes the only season of Fish. I'd say it's well worth it. And iut's something to do while we wait for the contract disputes so the rest of ""Newhart"" can come out. (Is it Duffy or Scolari holding things up?) This make4s the list of top seven best series, in my book: right up there with MASH, MAry Tyler Moore, Cheers, Will & Grace, Frasier and Friends.
  Great Writing, great acting and beautifully directed and produced. Go ahead.

4648450,5,B005BUA1JY,"I wasn't sure if the full series of BARNEY MILLER would ever be released, especially after Sony decided to scrap releasing any more seasons after #3. Gratefully, I learned that SHOUT FACTORY decided it was worth it, and went ahead to release this wonderful (complete) boxed series, in a great container, resembling the door to the precinct. In addition to all episodes in seasons one through eight, there are Bonuses, like interviews with the writers from the show, an excerpt from YOU DON'T KNOW JACK, about the life of Jack Soo, who played Sargent Nick Yemana, the plain clothes officer who made dry wit, bad coffee and racing slips look like an art form, and also, the original, unaired pilot THE LIFE AND TIMES OF BARNEY MILLER. This earlier pilot featured a different cast - that includes another wife for Barney, a character that was a prelude to Wojciehowicz (Max Gail) and a slightly different ""feel."" Gregory Sierra (Chano) and Ron Glass (Harris) were welcome additions, the second go around. What's more, believe it or not, Fish (Abe Vigoda) came off as almost ""perky"" in the first serving of the pilot. All episodes from season one of FISH, the spin off series, are also part of the collection - this was done after Fish (Abe Vigoda) retired from the ""Old 1-2"" and ended up living in a group home with a pack of foster kids and his wife. An interesting concept, but, understandably not the same as his contribution to BARNEY MILLER.

The laughs are fast and furious, here. The subject matter intelligently examines a range of topics - prostitution, drug addiction, terrorism, racism, relationships, homophobia, and language barrier (to name a few). I can honestly say that I missed the presence of Chano (Gregory Sierra), the witty, charismatic and hilarious Puerto Rican plain clothes Sargent, who left the series much too quickly after season two. I wish Wentworth (Linda Lavin) would have stuck around longer - but, her role as female plain clothes Sargent, and her romance with Wojo were not to last. Thankfully, a slew of madcap criminals, victims, scenarios and other members of police force came through the doors, to enlighten, entertain and educate.

BARNEY MILLER is one of the funniest show I have ever seen, aired on television. I am just glad that the show has finally been released on DVD, in its entirety so those who knew it in the 1970s and early 1980s can enjoy it again, and a new generation can become acquainted with its intelligent writing, timeless script and hilarity.",1323388800,3,2503,4.845794392523365

4648452,5,B005BUA1JY,Everything great. Picture and sound real good for being filmed years ago. Would highly recommend to anyone liking Barney Miller.,1322179200,3,128,5.45
4648453,5,B005BUA1JY,"I have the first season on dvd, I never saw the second on third seasons in the store, but after a bunch of shows that I have already bought started showing up in comlete sets, I assumed this one would too, so I waited. It looks like a good thing that I did. I loved Barney Miller back when I would watch it after school or in reruns. I don't remember much of when I saw it in first run since I was a bit young at the time, but I remember laughing at it. As I got older i started to appreciate the more subtle nuances of the show. You actually care about these characters. Everyone had a life outside of the precinct, and when they'd come together, we'd hear about it, some shows always seem as if the characters have no life unless they are in front of the camera, in this show everyone had their own little backstory and story arch. Harris wanted to be writer, Wojo couldn't pass the exam he needed to be promoted, Barney seemed like he had a lot of pressures both from home and from higher ups, but everyone seemed to genuinley care about each other. It seemed very close to a real job, and how real people acted. Though they had quite a few cast changes, all contributed greatly to the success and humor of the show. Plus, to be able to get Fish in the same collection is a plus, and considering how many seasons this had (plus fish) the price is more than reasonable. Like others have said, I will just give my older copy to someone else who might want it. I don't remember it being very pricy at the time. So no big loss. Besides I am starting to like the idea of how they are boxing seasons now. it takes up less room on the shelf. and I have quite a collection now. So I will definitely be making room for this one...and if anyone is upset about how this show was released, contact the company that put out the original series and ask them what the hell was their problem. but don't just point your animosity at a new company and a newer release, that's just trying to make up for the mistakes of the original company. I think if a company begins to release a series they should release the whole series. But that will never happen cause the studios are all about the money, even when they have a classic quality show, they'd rather release trash if it brings in the dough. So don't blame shout factory or criticise this release. Otherwise companies may decide just not to release certain series at all.

update, the packaging is great, a strong sturdy slip cover, booklet and regular sized dvd cases (holding six discs each, except seasons 1 & 2 because of the short first season only has five discs) There are two seasons to a case, and season one is mislabled. they had nine episodes on disc one but only four on disc two, this could be due to the fact that they probably just copied what was out there already, and then continued on where the studio stopped before...I assume they weren't releasing anymore) The booklet is nice and has a small intro with little notes on each episode. the packaging is great, and for the most part it looks great too (probably as good as you can expect a series of it's age to look..if not a bit better). I thoroughly enjoy this show and highly recommend it. One thing I don't understand though, is if they are going to include fish, to give this a more complete feel, then why not release both seasons? There were only two seasons of Fish, so why tease us by giving us season one and not two? It makes the complete collection feel a little less complete. but my review is based on the Barney Miller part, and not the fish part lol since it's more or less an extra. Upon reading the episode guide of Barney Miller I do not see any reference to an episode where the sweathogs showed up in the squad room. I swear I saw that episode in first run? did anyone else see that? or am I crazy?",1321142400,3,3829,4.252400548696845

Shout! In my opinion is the absolute best company ever! They really show their sincere caring for the fans with releases of just about any and all classic tv shows.  Barney Miller promises to be one excellent release with all the extras.  Definitely will be on my Christmas list for sure!,1319932800,3,461,4.275862068965517
4648459,5,B005BUA1JY,"Looks like I am the first reviewer here on Amazon to have actually viewed these discs, so hopefully people will find my initial reactions useful.

So much has been said about the series itself I won't repeat any of it here. Just be assured that Barney Miller is one of the best written, best acted sitcoms (or any TV series for that matter) ever. I've seen every episode multiple times and have been collecting recordings of this show on commercially available VHS tapes, broadcast sources, and DVDs for many years. So I was very glad to see Shout Factory pick up the baton where Sony left off and release the show as it should have been from the beginning, as a complete series set.

I have not seen all the episodes in this set yet, but the ones I have seen run about 25 minutes instead of the 22-minute syndicated versions most often seen on TV since the show's original run. The picture quality is great for a TV series shot on video in the 1970s. About as good as it possibly can look, I'm sure. Sound quality is excellent. The packaging is very well done, tasteful, and discs are NOT stacked on top of each other on a single spindle as many of these mega-sets have been packaged recently. The 40-page book has a nice few pages of intro but the rest is essentially an episode guide for each season and disc.

The extras and supplements are great. There are about an hour and a half worth of shorts featuring Hal Linden, Max Gail, Abe Vigoda, and two of the writers. These are well worth watching. For me the real treat in the extras was the unaired pilot episode of ""The Life and Times of Barney Miller"" which is quite different from the show we know as Barney Miller. The pilot was shot on film, first of all, and looks very different from the ""real"" show for that one reason alone. The sets are almost exactly the same, but Linden and Vigoda are the only cops who play the same roles in the actual series. The show focused much more on Barney's home life and was split about 50/50 between the 2 sets.

There are several very insightful commentaries by the writers on some of the episodes. I learned a lot about the series that I did not know. Particularly fascinating were the ""rules"" of scriptwriting for Barney Miller, the unique way of shooting that was employed, and the unusual relationship (or lack of it) that Danny Arnold and the writing staff had with ABC. Really worthwhile and interesting stuff. The first season of Fish is a nice bonus but I have not gotten into viewing those discs.

If I have one complaint about this set it is that the first three seasons are absolutely identical to the previous Sony releases. Basically the Sony discs have been re-labeled with new artwork but the entire content of those discs (including the menus) are Sony's previous releases, manufactured again for this set. Ideally, Shout would have made new menus that matched their treatment of seasons 4-8, which in my opinion is better than what Sony did. This one gripe makes me wish Shout would have not just ""ported over"" the old discs into their set. But when you look at the massive amount of great stuff you get in this set, that is an imperfection well worth putting up with.

If you like Barney Miller, do not hesitate to buy this set. I sold my old single-season sets of the first 3 seasons on ebay to subsidize this purchase and when you look at Amazon's price which is currently in the $100 range you are talking about less than a dollar an episode for an absolutely top-notch show. This set was a tremendous undertaking by Shout Factory to produce and I must give kudos to them for all their work in preserving this deserving series for the digital age. You will not be disappointed by the results of that effort.",1319587200,121,3725,4.478645066273932

4648461,5,B005BUA1JY,"I thought,I had seen,the best that Shout, had to offer. Boy,was I wrong! To have all the seasons,in 4 regular size cases. To have a 32 page booklet and new special features. With also the 1st season of Fish(also in a regular size case) included. All in one set!

I have purchased the first three seasons of Barney Miller and will give them as gifts after I recieve the complete series from Shout Factory. Thank you again Shout! Factory. It smarts a bit, but Shout Factory did not case the problem it was Sony.

Hopefully, Shout! Factory can work on releasing Murpy Brown,WKRP and Night Court.

4648464,5,B005BUA1JY,"ABC-TV's BARNEY MILLER aired 170 episodes between 1/23/75 and 5/20/82. For three consecutive seasons ('76, '77, '78) it was in Nielsen's Top 20 and in 1979 it reached #21. Cast changes, especially the departure of Abe Vigoda (Det. Sgt. Philip K. Fish) for his own spinoff series and the death of Jack Soo (Det. Sgt. Nick Yemana) to esophogheal cancer in early 1979, may have caused the show's decline in viewership. CBS's airing of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MAGNUM-P-I/dp/B00005JMHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MAGNUM P.I.</a>&nbsp;opposite Barney probably had an effect as well, or after eight seasons the series may have just run its natural course.

The most troubling departure for this Miller fan has always been that of Gregory Sierra, who played Det. Sgt. Chano Amenguale. His character vanished without explanation after Season Two (Sierra went on to his own short-lived series), and when ""Roz"" (Mari Gorman) briefly came aboard over two years later, she was tersely described as Chano's replacement.

Two regular cast members in later years, Steve Landesberg and Ron Carey, had their first Miller spots as men in the holding cell. Landesberg played a phony priest and Carey a nabbed cat burglar (Mari Gorman also debuted as an arrestee, a streetwalker). Early on, Linda Lavin (as Det. Janice Wentworth) had a hot and heavy thing with Max Gail (Det. Stan ""Wojo"" Wojciehowicz), but then she left to star in CBS-TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ALICE/dp/B000EU1QBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ALICE</a>. Liz, Barney's wife, was played sporadically by Barbara Barrie in the first two seasons, and then got reduced to someone he occasionally mentioned or spoke to on the phone. (In the Xmas show of Season 3, Barney (Hal Linden) turns down a chance at an affair in favor of his 19 year marriage.)

Of the familiar cast, only Hal Linden and Abe Vigoda appeared in BM's half-hour pilot episode, which ABC aired in summer 1974. (Abby Dalton played Liz M.) This script was recycled with a retooled cast for the sitcom's official debut, as a mid-season replacement, the following January.

Peripheral and regular characters came and went, but the core of Linden, Gail and Ron Glass (as foppish clotheshorse and would-be author Det. Ron Harris) remained constant. For eight seasons, writing and performances were consistently above average, making BARNEY MILLER arguably the best-ever cop show and one of TV's finest sitcoms.

4648465,5,B005BUA1JY,"This review replaces a previous review.

Starting with ""The Dick van Dyke Show"" and ending with ""Frasier"", there have been perhaps a dozen brilliantly written and wildly funny American sitcoms still worth watching. (""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is brilliant, but not excruciatingly funny.) Among these, ""Barney Miller"" is primum inter pares.

Not only is ""Barney Miller""'s wit dry -- dry enough to mop up the Johnstown flood -- but largely based on ordinary conversation, rather than a setup/punchline format. The ensemble cast -- an odd mixture of actors and stand-up comics -- is one of the best ever assembled for a TV series. Though the characters are stereotypes, they're sufficiently fleshed-out that we can find a plausible humanity in them.

Surprisingly, ""Barney Miller"" remains strikingly un-dated. Crime, criminals, and people's reaction to crime have changed very little.

There are at least two classic episodes -- an early one in which Chano is forced to kill a bank thief, and the (in)famous one in which the squad consumes hash-laced brownies.

This set is an absolute must for any classic-TV collector. Or anyone who appreciates great comic writing and acting.

TECHNICAL STUFF

Shout! Factory promised to fix all the technical problems that have existed from the beginning. They did not, as it would have taken too long and cost too much money.

These problems include color fringing and blooming (which persisted throughout the series), and variations in brightness, color, and saturation among the cameras. * ""Landmark I"" and ""Landmark II"" are particularly bad, (invalid) examples of why NTSC was said to stand for ""never twice the same color"". One of the 7th season's episodes has muffled, slightly ""phasey"" sound.

* This is not only incomprehensible, but inexcusable, showing either extreme incompetence or an utter lack of concern on the part of ABC's technicians.",1315008000,6,1882,5.246666666666667
4648466,4,B005BUA1JY,"I've had a quick flick through some of these reviews for the forthcoming box set and I'm looking forward to it coming out as well.
Barney Miller was screened here in the UK in the early 80's in the early hours of Sunday morning (12.30am - 1am if memory serves me right) in the Granada ITV region (Lancashire, Manchester, Liverpool area) and I don't think it was screened anywhere else in the UK as far as I know.
I remember it well from my early teenage years & have Series 1-3 in the previous editions.
Would be great to see the rest of the series but the point I'm here to make  is that the other reviewers are lucky they live in the States. Living here in the UK means that it's never going to get a UK/European release ( for a potential audience in single figures?) so I'll have to get an import copy if I decide to take the plunge. Which means import duties, VAT, post office administration charges & who knows what else.
So, for anyone griping about the price please spare a thought for the one or two potential purchasers from the UK - we'll be paying a lot more!!
With all the extra features that are promised and the prospect of this being the only chance of getting the whole series .... it's certainly tempting.
Apologies if this isn't really a ""review"", but thought maybe other fans would like to know there are other fans in far flung places.",1314489600,19,1355,4.334645669291339

Another reason to buy this set is because it includes the Fish spin-off. Fondly remembered as Tessio in The Godfather movies, Abe Vigoda will always be best remembered as Fish. With TV today full of reality series, it is nice to see character driven shows popular again. Turn off the Kardashians and turn on Barney and his crew again.",1313625600,3,493,4.369565217391305

I guess it could also be the club for people who were concerned that the remaining seasons would never be released on DVD. So I was very happy when I heard the news about the Complete Series set.

I don't regret buying the earlier individual seasons. I've enjoyed watching them and will either give them to friends or take them to the local used disc shop and get a few bucks back.

The price (especially Amazon's price) is a great value for this set not to mention all the extra features included. Thank you Shout Factory!!!",1313107200,4,612,4.455357142857143

I could care less about already having the 1st 3 seasons because it was clear that the Idiot's at Sony were not going to release anymore of them.  I can not wait until this complete set is released. I am going to buy myself an early Christmas present.  Barney Miller, in my opinion was the best sitcom of the 70's and early 80's with MASH running a close 2nd.  It is about time that this GREAT show was given the respect it deserves. Thank you Shout Factory very, very much !!",1312156800,4,568,4.165137614678899
4648471,5,B005BUA1JY,I was thrilled when I opened my email account to find a message from Amazon that I was finally going to be able to buy the entire series. This is without a doubt one of the best sitcoms ever produced. I have been waiting so long for this to happen. I also have the first 3 seasons already but I don't care. I will gladly pay for the whole set. Now if someone would just do the same for the 'Cybill' series. That was another show that I don't think was given the respect it deserves.,1312156800,2,482,4.03125
4648472,3,B005BUA1JY,"Barney Miller was a great series.  Well the first three seasons were fantastic.  The next two were great and the last three were just okay.

Now that said.  I have to agree that it is terrible that Shout is only releasing the entire set and not the remaining seasons individually.  Many people had the same feelings about Mary Tyler Moore (the first 4 seasons were released by 20th and then Sony was to release the complete series.) but there was an uproar and the remaining sets were released over a year.  So for those who do not want repay for sets they already have, then don't and wait it out.

On the good side, is that Shout has priced this reasonably this set at about $20 a season MSRP.  Less than that if you include the season of Fish.  And if you are willing to wait a little, someone (probably Amazon) will have it on sale over the holidays for at least 50% off.

Lastly, don't trust Shout to provide complete episodes.  About half the episodes in the first season of Rhoda were the edited syndicated episodes.  I am not blaming them because they can only release what they are given.  So if you are expecting the original uncut episodes, beware.",1312070400,10,1159,4.436018957345971

This is an excellent show, I thought only the first season or two were good but after seeing some of the later episodes on television I realized that it was consistent all the way through.

While I am impressed with the extras reported as included, I am wanting assurance about the technical treatment of the source material. Pitlik and Arnold took alot of chances with Barney Miller including the video format that gave Barney Miller that particularly 'live' feel. I will willingly eat the cost of the first single seasons release to have the full set as buffed up and pretty as modern technology can make it. This is just great news.",1311897600,9,533,4.5625

This was the ultimate police-related comedy series. Everyone was an integral part of this, from the writers to the ensemble cast. This is in a class with M*A*S*H, Taxi and WKRP. As for the people who wish the se3ries had been released season by season...well, Sony dropped the ball and Shout picked it up. I think the price for this is pretty much on a reasonable par (as one other reviewer said, about $22 per season, when a lot of series are selling for roughly $40 a season...and it's all finally available, that's the main thing). Nice job, Shout Factory. It was about damn time the rest of these shows were made available.

I purchased seasons 1-3 thru Amazon and noticed season 1 is missing two episodes strangely enough.

For those HATERS who bought the other boxes and are upset because this one is re-releasing them. There's a very good chance that these episodes will be in their entirety. Many probably might overlook and not notice some obvious cuts and edits on the episodes released by Sony. They were from syndicated versions and not the full originals.

It seems to me that people should be rating the show, not the fact that a company has decided to release the entire series in one box set, even though the first 3 seasons were already released.

4648482,3,B005BUA1JY,"First I'd like to thank Shout Factory for releasing this. Many shows would end up abandoned if it was not for them, so this is not really their fault.

Unfortunately, I also bought the first 3 seasons of Barney Miller, so of course I am a bit annoyed. It is the customers who are the backbone of buying these shows that get penalized the most, time after time. Since this is not the first time this has happened, it makes people AVOID buying shows one season at a time. Ironically then, the companies when they release single seasons see poor sales, and 'stop' there. Meanwhile there ARE plenty of people who would buy a particular show but ONLY if it's released in a ""complete"" package.

This is killing the whole vintage TV DVD market and the companies don't even realize why it is the main reason for poor sales. Yet there is such a simple solution, and EVERYONE would be happy and customers would no longer be afraid to buy causing companies to make greater profits.

==================================

The solution on how all DVD's should be released for Classic TV shows in the FUTURE:

1) if no seasons have been released, only release the set as a COMPLETE BOX SET.

2) if previous seasons have been released, then release the show as a Box Set in TWO parts simultaneously.

Part A would be a set of seasons previous released for those that don't own them and waited.

Part B would be the remaining unreleased seasons, for those who bought the earlier seasons individually.

==================================
Done this way ... everyone would be happy.",1311465600,75,1561,4.730627306273063

I too purchased the first three seasons and REFUSE to buy a box set unless the distributor is willing to reimburse me for the cost of the first three seasons.
