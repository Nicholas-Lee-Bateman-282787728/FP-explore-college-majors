4428355,5,B004M0DYIY,"What a movie!  First off, it's very explicit in the sex scenes so beware of that.  They were very well done.  Beyond the sex scenes, it's really a good movie with an excellent story about the nobility, their wives and servants in ancient times.

It's hard to try to review this movie without giving away the plot, but I'll try anyway.  I'll just say there's marriage and duty to your country to produce an heir.  Then there's love.  All different kinds of love.  After that, there's doing your ""duty"" as your Master demands to keep up his public image.  Then there's the consequences of following your heart and desires.

I have to say that it wasn't what I expected, but it was so much better than I thought even after viewing it the first time.  I've watched it several times and still come to the conclusion that it's a very good movie.  It's probably underrated because of the explicit sex scenes.  Some people won't be able to get past that.  It's a movie that's not for everyone and different people will get different things from the movie.  I enjoyed it and am glad that I bought it.",1407283200,9,1091,4.467005076142132
4428356,5,B004M0DYIY,"It was shocking with the nudity and theme, but it was a great script, acting, and story. I was not
expecting the story line at all. The acting was so incredible, I had to give this a solid five stars.",1399420800,5,200,4.025
4428357,5,B004M0DYIY,"Great story, acting and direction. Courageous pushing of the envelope. The sets and costuming are very well done, but don't intrude upon or overwhelm the story.",1384387200,5,160,5.1923076923076925
4428358,4,B004M0DYIY,"This drama held my interest from the moment the children appeared on the screen espousing concepts of duty & loyalty that were far above their actual comprehension.  Then the theme of loyalty was tested in every conceivable way until the operatic finish.  Viewers must be warned that there is a number of graphic sexual encounters, between genders and same genders.  It seemed to flow from the characters and their strange situation, but it did seem to move rather quickly into intimacy.  But given all that, the characters were written well and the acting done with real sincerity.  I would not share this video with just anyone, but I do think that it could be lent with an appropriate warning, to anyone who wishes to think about the complications of loyalty, duty and brainwashing of the young.  Also, the ending is unexpectedly violent, so I could not give it 5 stars.",1374710400,,873,4.786666666666667
4428359,5,B004M0DYIY,"I ordered this DVD from Amazon, and it was sent by Kimook.  The service was prompt and I was very pleased with it.  The movie should be ordered and viewed only after having read some of the other reviews.  It may be too graphic for some people.  I do not classify it as a family film but it is extremely well done.  I especially enjoyed the costumes, the acting, the choreography (both dancing, sword fighting, etc), the horseback riding, the scenery and the period (1300 AD) music.",1329091200,,482,4.494252873563219

4428362,5,B004M0DYIY,Love it! I am so thankful I can get this movie here in the US. It does play on my bluray player.,1449619200,,96,3.409090909090909
4428363,5,B004M0DYIY,Wonderful and disturbing historical fiction. Beautifully acted and photographed.  Anyone looking for another a sweet and romantic sweeping epic -- a Korean GONE WITH THE WIND -- should really give this film a pass.,1443916800,,214,5.294117647058823
4428364,5,B004M0DYIY,"i am truly torn about how to rate this due to the fact that the original Korean actors voices have been dubbed..You might not think that this should make too much difference, but really it does.  Everything an actor brings to his role, particularly his own voice, makes up the overall performance..So dubbing, to me, is offensive to the actors and has a negative effect should one have seen the film as originally presented.
To purchase, this is not in-expensive..There should be more information presented in an easy to find way both from the distributor and from Amazon itself.  The Asian market is not a passing fad...
Overall, while the film could be seen as simple and straightforward enough, the director is to be congratulated on his handling of presenting also that within the film which is not so straightforward.  The sets, the music, the pacing, and particularly the presentation of the literal beauty of the love and intimacy which develops between the Queen, and the King's man is stunning.
The ""Frozen Flower"" (for me) in this film is the King's man, (Hong Rim) as played by Zo In-sung.  Hong Rim, from the age of approx. 7 yrs., is 'chosen' from among all the young boys the 16-18 year old King has collected and begun to groom to be his elite team of protectors...Hong Rim is given 'special status' complete with his own room within the King's private chambers, becoming the object of the King's myopic attention and later, at some un-specified age, his concubine. .. Hong Rim has no rights whatsoever, no power, and no say-so even over his own sexuality.
The King, for all his subtleties, is a child molester, guilty of abuse of the worst kind.
Hong Rim, now a young man in his early 20's, is finally forced into a position that causes him to see and try to come to terms with his 'true' standing with the self-centered and wholly selfish King, so that he can go back to managing the realities of his now recognized 'enslavement.'
The King is played by Joo Jin-mo, and the Queen is played by Ji-hyo Song.  The director from South Korea is Yoo Ha.
I've viewed this film several times, though the ending is hard to watch.  Expect there to be a lot to talk about, should you see it with your spouse, friend, and/or significant other.
Bravos to the lead actors in an extraordinary production, and to all connected with ""A Frozen Flower.""",1443312000,4,2350,4.650602409638554

4428366,5,B004M0DYIY,DVD came in quicker than expected from provided time frame! No technically issues only the subtitles contained some grammatical errors but not complaining.,1433289600,,155,5.782608695652174
4428367,3,B004M0DYIY,A good movie with excellent acting.,1431561600,,35,5.0
4428368,5,B004M0DYIY,"""A Frozen Flower"" is one of the most beautiful movies, edging our the movies of Zhyang Zimou, with brilliant camera work, colour and scripting. The history of Korea is little known to westerners, and the king in the movie was reportedly a major figure in the history of the country. The gay theme may or may not be historically accurate, but its treatment in the movie was very well directed and staged. I enjoyed the movie greatly and was glad to add it to my collection of Chinese, Japanese and Korean period movies.",1430006400,3,518,4.580645161290323

8435379,5,B004M0DYIY,"This movie is for adults. If you have a strict conservative view regarding physical attraction this movie is NOT for you. The storyline is very concise, and the sexual content is appropriate to the story. All this being said, I thought the movie was really well done. Jo In Sung is one handsome guy. I totally enjoyed it.",1496188800,,321,4.551724137931035

8435386,5,B004M0DYIY,"4-27-2016 Wed. 12:01 am. I loved it, that epic movie was more than terrific. The only problem is that when I ordered the DVD, did not see that it was sold to me without English subtitles since I don't understand the Korean language, wish I did. I wrote to you about it in regards to the seller possibly switching with me the proper DVD. I wrote the seller a letter regarding this oversight, have not heard from this seller since I wrote it over 2 weeks ago, I'm so very disappointed. But amazingly, I've watched it over again but did not know that it's on Youtube with English subtitles and I didn't have to pay them a cent! So I feel jilted, made a fool, I don't want my money back but just a switch from that DVD I brought on Amazon to a DVD with English subtitles. That movie made a huge impact on me especially with the acting abilities and super acting especially by Jo In Sung, and Joo Jin Mo, now I'm a devoted fan of theirs and will be on the lookout for their future films, movies, etc. I was deeply impressed by the seriousness of the story behind the Joseon Dynasty. Loved the scenery, colorful costumes in all their regalia, the beautiful music. I'm so glad I saw these scenes on Youtube which inspired me to get the DVD. Is it possible to switch it to English subtitles. I can watch that movie over and over again. Thank you for your continues services, Frances Soares",1461715200,,1381,4.315384615384615
