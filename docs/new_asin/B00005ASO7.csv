I have seen a lot of MMA events (for example Absolute Fighting Championships,World Vale Tudo Championship, Free Fights events from holland and of course the UFC). When i liked a NHB-fight whitin these events, it is because it has moments in witch the fighters are testing eachother's skills standing up on their feet and moments in witch these same fighters are on the ground.
The event of PRIDE has too many fights that lasted too long on the ground. The fights are OR relatively short and ended on the ground, for example an early arm lock, OR the fights shows fighters who are constantly or for almost the whole time on the ground.
There are however 2 fights that are an exceptions to this. First, the fight between Gary Goodridge (pay attention to the way the japanese announcer pronounce the name of 'Big Daddy' Goodridge, very funny) versus Yoshiaku Yatsu. This japanese warrior said that not he, but his fans wanted him to fight. Gary really punishes his opponent and i assume that Yoshiaku Yatsu after this fight regrets his decision to fight because of his fans. However, he did show a lot of heart, AMAZING.
The second fight that is worth seeing is Naoya Ogawa vs. Masaaki Satake, that means JUDO vs. KARATE.
The Sakuraba fight is actually not worth mentioning. It did not last long.
I you like grappling or you're a fan of submission, in that case this PRIDE may be the thing you are looking for.
If you are a fan of KO's or you are a MMA-fan that especially likes the good old days of No Hold barred contest, you may be bored with a number of fights on this DVD.",1017360000,7,1748,4.517350157728707
7935738,5,B00005ASO7,"Pride is probably the best MMA tourney and this is one of the best groups of matches they put together. If you have watched any MMA tournaments, you owe it to yourself to see pride and this is a good starting point.
My only negative point is that the bonus material (DVD) is slim and the documentary!! tells you the results of fights you may not have seen.",1013644800,2,356,4.25
7935739,5,B00005ASO7,This ranks right up there as one of the best PRIDE events... The lack of vale tudo type rules can sometimes lead to a few very boring GROUND and POUND matches in Pride but thankfully here aren't too many boring moments in this gem. There's a good old fashioned upset a biiiiig buttwhoopin and a couple of superb finishing moves. There are a couple of matches that look a little one sided but thankfully the winners won in style so that makes it all the more interesting....but I'm not sure if I can watch Katsu vs Goodridge again. The Judo vs Karate match with Ogawa and Sataakeis one of my favourites..the crowd is so excited that it adds to the whole thing.  Since PRIDE NEW BLOOD is one of the most boring MMA shows I've ever seen it was nice to have my faith restored by this.,994550400,3,780,4.3061224489795915
