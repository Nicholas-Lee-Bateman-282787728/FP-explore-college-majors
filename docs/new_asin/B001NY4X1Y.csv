3724814,4,B001NY4X1Y,I ordered this video as extra reference material for my son's school project about Gustavo C. Garcia.  Good video about some Mexican-Americans you may have not known about before.,1354838400,7,179,5.172413793103448
3724815,5,B001NY4X1Y,"This was very educational and it wasn't boring to my 13 year old, we both enjoyed it and watched it together.",1354579200,14,109,4.238095238095238
3724816,5,B001NY4X1Y,Excellent documentary on a very little know subject. It is about time that more information on minority issues comes to the public consciousness.,1353369600,,145,5.3478260869565215
3724817,5,B001NY4X1Y,This was an excellent educational message to show the treatment of many who today are becoming the largest minority in this great country.  The tragic death of Attorney Garcia is one that could have been prevented with possible intervention and treatment for his alcoholism and mental health issues.  Thank you Attorney Garcia for your brilliance and God bless your soul for your unfortunate downfall to the drink.  God bless his family and friends.....,1286323200,4,453,5.178082191780822
3724818,5,B001NY4X1Y,"Until this documentary, Hernandez vs Texas, was one of historys' greatest kept secrets.  Thanks to A CLASS APART, filmmakers Carlos Sandoval and Peter Miller shine the light on a group of brave Texas pioneers who bothered to challenge the status quo.  This case is as historically significant in American history as Brown vs Board of Education, but was overshadowed by the Brown ruling a few weeks later in 1954.  This film goes a long way in reminding people that the struggles for equality and social justice by Mexican-Americans in Texas in the 40's and 50's remain important lessons that need to be told.",1255219200,21,608,4.883495145631068
3724819,5,B001NY4X1Y,"This intelligent, fascinating piece of investigative journalism is a compelling account of how  racism re: Latinos totally permeated Texas society in the 1950s. Why and how an ordinary murder case precipitates a challenge to conventional jury selection, and gets all the way to the US Supreme Court is an amazing story, and must be seen...",1242518400,18,339,5.163636363636364
3724820,4,B001NY4X1Y,"I watched this documentary with a Mexican-American friend who had a unique childhood experience.  She was in the US and in Texas for the first time.  On the playground, a white girl shoved her toward a Black girl and yelled, ""She's not white!""  The Black girl pushed her back and said, ""Well, she's not Black!""  At the time, she did not know enough English to respond to both girls, but she knew both statements were accurate.  This documentary too tries to create a third path and find space outside of the Black-white paradigm.
The documentary starts by detailing discrimination against Mexican Americans before the Civil Rights Movement.  In Texas, they were forced to sit in the back of theaters and many restaurants would not serve them.  The point of this case was to challenge how Mexican Americans were not allowed on juries.  The case involved an intraracial murder and I'm surprised another test case wasn't chosen.  (This is similar to how the Miranda of Miranda rights was no saint.)
On the one hand, Mexican Americans were deemed white de jure, but treated as less-than-white de facto.  A legal team came up with the idea that they were ""a class apart"" (thus the title of the work).  It argued that they couldn't be deemed equal if they were treated as not the equals to whites.  Even though the close time frame was quite close to ""Brown v. Bd. of Education,"" this legal team was diligent to distance themselves from African Americans, so said the narrator.  At no point did the legal team argue that they were of indigenous descent or that they were people of color.  The work even says most Supreme Court justices did not really know that Mexican Americans existed.  One Justice referred to the group by an epithet and didn't know he was doing it.  (The documentary doesn't mention how many Justices knew nothing about the target group in ""Bowers v. Hardwick"" thirty years later.)
The interviewees were diverse in terms of gender.  I got the sense that every interviewee was Latino, but some could have been Caucasian.  The work spoke about the lead attorney Gilberto Garcia being handsome, brilliant, but alcoholic.  I like that they showed a leader as being a complex figure; they didn't sugar-coat the facts to make viewers feel at ease.  I don't recall hearing of this case in law school and I wonder if this work may be the catalyst for covering this case as much as a ""Brown"" or a ""Korematsu.""
The documentary liner notes said it was an hour long, but it was more like 50 minutes.  I swear Edward James Olmos was the narrator, but I didn't see his name anywhere in the credits.  This important documentary would have had a wider audience if it had Spanish language subtitles as an option.",1240790400,46,2710,4.697033898305085

3724823,5,B001NY4X1Y,This DVD arrived quicker than I'd hoped -- surpassed customer expectations. The quality of the product is great. The content is superb -- should be required viewing for everyone!,1403136000,,178,5.172413793103448
3724824,5,B001NY4X1Y,This was a very well done piece.  The students were involved and learned something they did not know.  I highly recommend it for inner city kids who have a very narrow view of the world beyond their neighborhood.,1398643200,,212,4.552631578947368
3724825,5,B001NY4X1Y,"They argued that their client was neither black nor white, but a class apart, which stopped  discrimination against Mexicans in Texas. Highly recommended.",1395705600,,154,5.695652173913044
3724826,5,B001NY4X1Y,"This film reminded me of my youth-growing up in Kingsville, Texas.  I remember going to the train depot and water fountains and restrooms for Negros & White.  We used to get spanked in school for speaking our own language-spanish-and be told that ""you are este lado del rio"".  I remember my family talking about Gus Garcia and the case.",1393632000,9,336,4.661016949152542

3724830,3,B001NY4X1Y,"I used this dvd as a teaching tool for a summer school World History class of mostly Hispanic students. I showed this along with the film, The Other Side of Immigration.  The second film was entirely in Spanish with subtitles.  I was teaching a human rights unit.  I tried to get a discussion going after each film, but the students were a bit hesitant, so I had them write about them.  The feedback was incredible. Some of my students' parents are here illegally; those students had a lot to say about their roles in society. I'm giving this film 3 stars, but I would give The Other Side of Immigration 4+ stars.  The NonHispanic students felt like their questions were answered.  Some of the NonHispanic students assume that Hispanic students will be in remedial classes, or that they will be the students who act out, but their knowledge of Hispanic students' background is limited.  We're in California, so the film raised more questions than answered for the students, but it made them think. This film gives young people, especially people who don't normally think about society, reflect on it. It's valuable and worth buying.",1373241600,7,1132,4.804123711340206

8328318,5,B001NY4X1Y,"I like the DVD, but I wish they would've gone more in dept into the Mexican American struggle for Civil Rights. There is so much more to it than this, but it's my job to find more sources. As an educator, I find this very valuable. I try my best to do a decent job at teaching a more accurate and diverse history to what our kids are used to. US History isn't Black and White; there is so much more that we must understand. There are Americans of many backgrounds and we all have spot in history, especially Native Americans (including Mexicans). They can be excluded in textbooks, but they cannot be erased from history.",1493942400,3,621,4.362068965517241
8328319,5,B001NY4X1Y,I saw this on PBS a while back and wanted to buy it to show to my kids & grandkids. They don't have a clue what on the struggles of the Mexican Americans. Sadly with all the politics now - I'm seeing more and more of the same discrimination that I dealt with in the 60's and 70'2.,1475625600,2,280,3.8448275862068964
