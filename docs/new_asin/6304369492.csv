Stockard Channing and Stephen Collins have a real connection that shows a real bond without the usual romantic mushy stuff.,1206230400,,250,4.533333333333333
7868988,5,6304369492,"This movie is for the entire family. The actors all work so well together and even the children show a flare for acting. You won't find vulgar language, nude scenes or blood and guts in this one! What you will find is a plot that is well written and a movie that is a pure pleasure to watch. It is a heart warming film about two sisters who haven't gotten along in the past and now one decides she wants to try the ""single"" life. Stockard Channing is spectacular, as always, as the sister who is tricked into caring for her niece and nephew for one night. Or so she thought.....

Unfortunately this is yet another movie that has not come to DVD yet. But then how many really good ones do these days? If you get a chance to see it, you won't regret the time you spent sitting in front of the TV. The sequel to this movie is ""An Unexpected Life"" and just as memorable as this one is.",1184716800,5,881,4.122093023255814
7868989,5,6304369492,"Amazing because Stockard Channing and the other actors in this movie make a made for tv movie something very special...Not only did I buy this movie, I bought the sequel sight unseen.  I give my very highest recomendation to anyone thinking of buying this movie.  Do, you will not be disappointed.",1022284800,4,297,4.803921568627451
