7130241,1,B00WBJSOJ2,"Couldn't get past the first 30 minutes on this one.  Slow, plodding.  May have been ok if I had given it a chance.  Younger girl (don't even remember her name), seemed really stupid to me. The girl was writing high drama in some little notebook, something a 13 yr. old might write, and she was no 13 yr. old.  More like 30.",1439596800,,323,4.161290322580645
7130242,3,B00WBJSOJ2,"Like any of the low-budget horror films, it was at time hard to understand. But I must say, as I began to grasp the plot,etc., I enjoyed it.",1438560000,,140,4.035714285714286
7130243,1,B00WBJSOJ2,"Boring, slow and made no sense",1437523200,,30,4.166666666666667
7130244,4,B00WBJSOJ2,"The story is a depressing, somber piece of emotional melodrama that delivers. It never loses the energy or haunting movement that is created at the beginning of the film. There is no times were the story falls flat or the energy dies out. It is just a chilling ballet of emotional, and visual surrealism. ""Shadow World: The Haunting OF Mysti Delane"" is a relatable story for almost anyone. You can strip down to the basic components of dealing with loss, feelings of abandonment and not belonging, never mind the mystical, magical, and paranormal components. That just adds to a well thought out, nicely delivered character study.

The special effects are a carefully balanced mix of shadow/light cinematography with some cool practical effects used during possession scenes that work well to really sell the moment. They don't feel cheap or poorly executed. The surrealism is heavy and theatrical. Dark and yet beautifully framed dreams stained by darkness and the thing that is haunting Mysti. The creature usage is perfect. The way Daniel Falicki chose to bring in the ""demon"" or ""Shadow man"" put some real horror in the story that looked creepy as heck.

Overall, ""Shadow World"" is a mature, well thought out story that never goes for big bangs or ""pop corn"" moments. It keeps a constant level of atmosphere that is true macabre and ""new age-y"". Mostly I was impressed with how the whole story and feeling was almost out of step with modern times and handled a spiritual belief system with understanding. I really can't say anything bad about the film. Okay I hated how it just ends the way it does but I get it. It continues the ballet of haunting artistry that is ""Shadow World: The Haunting Of Mysti Delane"".",1432857600,,1715,4.829931972789115
7130245,1,B00WBJSOJ2,"We love to watch horrible movies. We have our own version of ""The Burn Unit"", and Amazon prime is absolutely perfect for this. Terrible movies are one thing, but with even worse writing, directing and acting, it definitely makes for an interesting viewing experience. I can only guess that many of these ""movies"" are stuck with a limited budget (What, maybe $1,000?). This could be used towards props, writing, directing, or overall production costs (in hopes these ""directors"" have enough friends to help out by pretending to be actors), either way, it would appear as though they wasted far more than they used. A Shadow World does not disappoint if you're looking for a horrible movie. Even better, is when you find a stinker like this ""horror"" flick, and find it has more comedic value than anything else. Well, that is until we hear the main character rambling on like a manic depressive drama queen because the world differs from her opinions of how it should be.

It's a terrible, terrible movie at it's very best. The acting, writing, directing, etc, are all below amateur grade; and that's actually giving them credit. The editor of this (I assume) was probably a relative of the producer, or fresh out of his (high school) freshmen A/V club meeting. The only saving grace in this crap-fest is the fact that it's only about 73 minutes or so. If you're looking for a lame story, horrendous acting, zero directing etc, then I would recommend this. If you also enjoy bad movies, and expect this to be that rare diamond in the rough we sometimes stumble over, than I would recommend that you continue searching. The bad reviews here outweigh the positive for a reason; it's time that you will never get back, and watching paint dry is a far better alternative.",1470873600,2,1765,4.749185667752443
7130246,1,B00WBJSOJ2,"Watched five minutes, it was painful",1464998400,,36,5.166666666666667
7130247,3,B00WBJSOJ2,"Pretty decent for an obvious amateur hour effort. Fairly good acting, rather cool special effects, and OK editing/direction. But what's with the non-ending? This is the second or third no budget feature I've watched lately that leaves the door wide open for an unnecessary sequel.",1449014400,,280,5.2444444444444445
7130248,3,B00WBJSOJ2,"Low production values mar this fairly well-done flick.
This gets three stars from me because of its fairly cool depiction of witchcraft. Understated and direct, the two heroines are family-tradition witches with an old family problem. Cool herbal stuff, otherworld visions, etc, though all low-budget as can be.",1447200000,2,311,5.5
7130249,5,B00WBJSOJ2,Excellent low budget flick. It was based on  a lady whom family had spiritual abilities that allowed them to venture into the spirit world. However this became dangerous after they began to run into shadow figures,1445126400,,213,4.916666666666667

I turned this nonsense off after 10 minutes; she seriously gets on my nerves.

Love the convoluted philosophy about the ills of mankind and technology while she plugs in a portable electric hot plate for her eye of newt and toe of frog routine.",1441756800,,436,4.589743589743589

7130254,5,B00WBJSOJ2,"Decent horror movie 5 stars for creepiness, the plot isn't bad, good characters, no blood and gore the spirit is genuinely spooky. PLOT. Misti gets these roots near a tree boils them then drinks the tea enabling her to crossover into the spiritual realm. However after a while it becomes terrifying when a shadow like spirit crosses over into the human world and begins haunting her",1440633600,,382,4.803030303030303

8712840,2,B00WBJSOJ2,I'm sorry first time I reviewed a movie without actually watching it. Because of that I gave it a 2 stars. But I sure if I had continued. It would have gotten one star.,1496793600,,168,3.9705882352941178

8712842,5,B00WBJSOJ2,"I absolutely LOVE this movie.  It touched me very deeply on so many levels.  I love that the special effects are quite believable and not over the top.

The whole movie feels very REAL - like....I felt I was spying on my neighbor kind of real.  Watching them dabbling in things they shouldn't be and  then not knowing how to handle the situation that has gone way over their heads.

I was glad that there is no 'happy ending' too.  That, again was more like real-life situations.",1483920000,2,479,4.436781609195402

8712846,4,B00WBJSOJ2,"Quite a lovely film about 2 witches and a demon.  The first 20 or so minutes were a bit boring but once Aurelia arrived the story woke up.  However, I had to knock off a star for the ending which left me waiting a ""Continued next week"" message.",1479340800,,244,4.0625
8712847,3,B00WBJSOJ2,"It's not bad enough for a 1 star rating, but not good enough for a 5.  The aspects of creepiness, generational witchcraft, etc. are interesting. and both actresses do a fairly decent job with a bland script.  There's just not enough of anything.  And to top it off there is no real ending.  That's what irks me the most about this whole production.",1478217600,,348,4.476190476190476
