8439113,4,B004RPQSVO,"I must admit that being a Reno Historian I bought this movie (which was filmed in Reno in the fall of 1951) to see my town back in that era.
That having been said, the movie is an interesting story about mob corruption and the evils of... sports betting. It is good until the last few minutes of the movie when then U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver comes (Who tried like the dickens to win the presidency by appearing tough on the Mafia) on lecturing the audience on the evils of sports betting.",1505520000,,490,4.336956521739131

8439115,5,B004RPQSVO,"Directed by Robert Wise in a somewhat documentary style that evokes memories of earlier films like BOOMERANG (1947) and THE HOUSE ON 92nd STREET (1945), THE CAPTIVE CITY (1952) was inspired by the actual experiences of Time Magazine reporter Alvin Josephy, Jr., who co-wrote the screenplay with Karl Kamb.

Taking an essentially fictional approach to the material, the screenplay centers on John Forsythe, a small town newspaper editor, who discovers that his seemingly peaceful community is actually a haven for illegal bookmaking with most of the authorities and respectable citizens turning a blind eye to the matter.  Indeed, as Forsythe investigates the murder of his initial informant, not only does the local police start harassing him and his staff, but the ruthless Mafia boss running the mammoth operation has the papers young photographer (Martin Milner) beaten after he snaps an incriminating photo.  Soon, after the murder of a second informant, Forsythe and his wife (Joan Camden) are running for their lives, heading for the state capitol where they can present their findings to Senator Estes Kefauvers Committee on the Investigation of Organized Crime.

THE CAPTIVE CITY is a tense, entertaining drama that exposes the dark underside of a situation that existed in many American cities during the early 1950s, and probably still exists today.  The picture was shot entirely on location in Reno, Nevada, though one gets the impression that the fictional town portrayed in the movie is actually in one of the Southern states.  Giving the movie a certain credence is the on-screen appearance of Senator Kefauver at the end of the film, talking about the threat of organized crime in America.

The Blu-ray disc from Kino Lorber is razor sharp.

8439116,3,B004RPQSVO,"Newspaperman John Forsythe stirs up a hornet's nest of gangsters and small-town complicity while investigating the mysterious death of an acquaintance in Robert Wise's indie 'The Captive City' (Aspen Productions, 1952).  Forsythe is a little stiff and some of the dialogue treads a fine line between noir and corn, but all in all it's a tight, well-made B-picture (even given its softball ending).  3-plus stars.  MGM's DVD-R offers a clean b&w print (1.37:1 aspect ratio-- not widescreen as the package and Amazon's specs indicate) with no extras.  Presentation merits 3 1/2 stars.

Note: oddly, the plot description put out by the studio and reprinted above by Amazon is also inaccurate as the 'federal investigation' component serves merely as a bookend and doesn't really factor into the body of the film.",1386028800,3,809,5.1923076923076925

The story begins with a written quote from Senator Estes Kevaufer. The we see a two-door station wagon speed along a highway to the local police station. The man is the editor of a newspaper, his wife Marge is with him. James T. Austin speaks into a reel tape recorder about his story. Kennington is a small city of 36,000, a nice place to live. Austin is the editor of the local newspaper the `Journal'. He speaks to the editor of the society pages (as important as politics?). He gets a telephone call from Clyde Nelson, a private investigator, to meet in the library. Crossing the powers in the town leads to harassment. Murray Sirak's power affects the police. Nelson tells about a scandal; was he tailed by the police? Police Chief Gillette explains his actions. Weeks later at the Country Club he gets a telephone call from Nelson. A black car closes in on Nelson!

An automobile salesman has influence. Austin learns about the hit-and-run accident that killed Nelson. [An accident?] The widow tells about a car with Florida license plates. A wiretapped telephone? Did Nelson know too much? Was an insurance salesman involved with graft? Austin wrote to the State Board about this matter. This letter was sent to the Police Chief! Austin starts to investigate. Mrs. Sirak now works in a laundry, she doesn't cooperate. Austin looks into Nelson's office. His car is ticketed. The bookies dummied up. One advertiser rented space to a stranger, Mr. Fowler. The Police Chief withdrew their press privileges! At night Austin visits that warehouse and is told to go away. Their ""20 to 30 wires"" suggests a bookmaking operation in that industrial area. A young reporter watches people come and go during the day. The AP provides a report on Fabretti. Murray Sirak visits Austin to give him advice: ""you can't stop human nature"". A new advertising contract to squelch the news? Not for Austin?

Waiting at night allows a flash picture of three men. Later photographer Phil Harding is beaten and the negative stolen! Don advises backing off. Austin sees a car with Florida license plates near his home. He learns about the services provided by a big advertiser. They don't want to be embarrassed by a newspaper story. His wife tells about her experience being questioned in town. Mrs. Sirak visits to talk about Nelson's death and Murray's involvement. A strange car with two men is parked near his home. An advertiser cancels his orders. Mrs. Sirak is found dead! His editorial is rejected. Where's the proof? Landowners profit from renting to bookmaking operations. The Police Chief knows but can't prove murders. They raid the bookmaker's place but they are gone!

Chief Gillette explains how things work: strict, but not too strict. Austin talks to the ministers in town. One explains how gambling benefits the ""respectable elements""! Then Austin reads about the Kefauver Committee. Sirak gives him advice and asks for his answer. Austin leaves with his wife and drives all night. A car with two men follow him! Austin stops at the Warren police station. They get a police escort to the Senate Investigating Committee (which around the country). Senator Estes Kefauver explains how the citizens cleaned up Kennington. Gambling provides payoffs to the local establishment and police. ""Its up to you.""

Senator Estes Kefauver gained a lot of publicity in 1952 when he investigated organized crime. He was opposed by the local political bosses and establishment of New York city and northern New Jersey, and elsewhere. Since then Hollywood (owned or controlled by Wall Street investors) has created more movies sympathetic to organized crime. Who really controls your city, county, state, and country? Gamblers (most of whom are losers) are often associated with theft or embezzlement at their places of employment. It also draws away money from other businesses to cause a local recession. This happened at Atlantic City and other places with gambling casinos.",1351036800,4,3988,5.009049773755656
