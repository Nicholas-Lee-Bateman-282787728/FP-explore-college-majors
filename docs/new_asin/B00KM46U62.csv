8659862,4,B00KM46U62,"Yes, this is a low budget documentary, but if you know and care about this war, it's still pretty great. Following the timeline of the war in relation to the changing attitudes about the war as expressed though the era's poets is smartly curated. Including poetry from mostly the soldiers/poets in the trenches, but also, for instance, from a poet/mother back home is great. While a bit too repetitious insofar as war footage, as though the documentarians received the right to only a certain number of historical scenes, thee scenes are priceless. On the one hand, I'm glad they concluded with Wilfred Owen, but I think it may have been tighter to follow Owen with Sassoon and end there; however, the war poets featured in this film (mother/poet aside) all died before the war ended, and Sassoon survived the war. A worthy watch.",1518739200,,830,4.811188811188811
