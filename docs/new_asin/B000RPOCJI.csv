2874648,5,B000RPOCJI,"This is not a movie! Goosebumps was a television series in the mid 1990s that aired on Fox and was based on the book written by R.L. Stine! The series was filmed in Canada on a low-budget, which explains the bad acting and special effects.

There earlier DVD releases, like this one, were horrible as they don't contain menus and the picture quality is slightly below average.

Here we get two more episodes in the series. It Came From Beneath Sink is about Kat (played by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ginger-Snaps/dp/B000A2X3U2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ginger Snaps</a>' Katharine Isabelle) finding a strange sponge under the kitchen sink in her new house. This sponge is not normal as it has eyes and fangs.

In Strained Peas, Nicholas' parents bring home his new baby sister, Grace. One afternoon, Grace makes a message out of her baby building blocks. The message reads: ONLY ME!

These aren't the scariest Goosebumps episodes, but kids will enjoy watching them.",1346112000,,1014,5.480769230769231
2874649,5,B000RPOCJI,The Goosebumps series are all good spooky fun for the young teenage crowd. It Came from Beneath the Sink had an especially good cast and was quite humorous.,1258243200,,156,4.607142857142857
2874650,4,B000RPOCJI,"The individual versions of these may be going out of print.  For now they seem to be doubling them up.  At least there are future releases coming out.  Hopefully they will put out larger sets.  Anyway....

Even though it's not mentioned anywhere in this listing, this particular Goosebumps is a set of 2 episodes.  The first, It Came from Beneath the Sink, isn't overly scary and has a slight Gremlins feel to it.  Even though I'm in my 40s, I found it quite funny to watch the kids, who have just moved into a new neighborhood, as they discover something odd beneath the...you guessed it, SINK!  Is it really moving around scaring the dog?  Or is it just their imagination?  Quite fun finding out!  Now, the second story, Strained Peas, is by far my favorite.  It has a few real scares and may even be too much for a younger child.  You don't want any nightmares out of this.  Basically, a family with a preteen son have a new baby girl named Grace who is showing signs of not being completely innocent!  And the son is pretty much freaking out.

I'm plagued with being single and no children right now.  But these are still fun to watch by myself.  My guess is that these would be a perfect way to intro a kid to the fun of scary cinema with the whole family.  Sure, disturbing things happen but it's all nice in the end.  Main thing is the parent can watch it with the child and not get totally bored.  Or...you could watch Barney the dinosaur.  Now that's really scary!",1251763200,6,1473,4.377777777777778
2874651,5,B000RPOCJI,"My husband and I bought this for my daughter, who is 4 years old, for one of her christmas gifts because she loves this one the best of all the Goosebumps. She started watching them the month before Halloween on TV. After she saw this one she couldn't stop talking about it. Her twin brother is a little afraid of it and likes ""The ghost next door"" by Goosebumps best.",1199664000,4,368,4.271428571428571

8202216,2,B000RPOCJI,Who thought it was a good idea to put a flimsy DVD case in with a giant set of shampoo and conditioner bottles?  The DVD case was crushed and cracked on both sides.  The movie itself was fine and as described new (no complaints for the DVD performance).  But someone dropped the ball on packaging and there was not enough bubble wrap to keep items from sliding out of place and crushing the other or even using a smaller box would've helped.,1400112000,,441,4.353658536585366
