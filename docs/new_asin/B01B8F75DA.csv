8749626,4,B01B8F75DA,"I was looking for something new to watch with my 17 year old daughter and came across this movie. We decided to give it a try and we were glad we did. I no nothing about hacking but I like computers and I liked that there was a heroine which was good for my daughter. Also, it gave me a another chance to discuss the behavior and bad decisions  which got the girls in trouble. I would buy this to watch again if the price is right.",1471219200,,431,3.954022988505747
