8116746,5,B000F3AAG6,"Of the many Pedro Infante films I've seen (which is practically all of them), ""Los Gavilanes"" for my taste has the most beautiful songs. 2 of them are huapangos written by Jose Alfredo Jimenez, and are sung with exquisite tenderness by Infante: ""Ruega por Nosotros,"" and my all time favorite ""Cuando Sale la Luna."" The settings for them are also wonderful, as the film has excellent Epoca de Oro cinematography by Agustin Jimenez using a lot of soundstage sets. The other songwriter for this film is Ruben Fuentes, and there are many memorable musical moments.

The complex plot is centered on a mother's dark secret, and the class struggles between the poor workers and the tyrannical leading landowner, who rules with an iron fist (and has the army on his side). When the son of the landowner attacks Infante's girl and she kills herself rather than submit, he becomes a ""Robin Hood"" type of rebel, with a gang who call themselves ""Los Gavilanes."" There are a lot of action scenes with stupendous horses, and one can always admire Infante's amazing horsemanship, and he looks very dashing in his black Gavilan outfit.

Other reasons to cherish this film is the cast, which includes Lilia Prado, Ana Bertha Lepe, Hortensia Santovea as the mother, and Infante's brother Angel as the rich man's son (there's a plot clue there!). Most of all, there is a delightful performance by Angelica Maria, about 10 years old at the time, and it's a lovely remembrance of this most beloved star as a child actress.

""Los Gavilanes"" was the only film director Vicente Orona did with Infante, and it is a special one. Very entertaining, quite moving at times, and worth it for the music alone, especially ""Ruega por Nosotros"" and ""Cuando Sale la Luna.""
