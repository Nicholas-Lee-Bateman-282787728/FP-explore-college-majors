8724059,3,B011BRK7R6,Not the best Sword and Sandal movie by a long shot but it is good to have an English language DVD (DVD-R actually) of it with a decent widescreen transfer and good color. This is the longer European version and some of the scenes are in Italian because they were never dubbed into English. One of these scenes has English subtitles but the others do not. No big deal as it is primarily action stuff anyway. Richard Harrison never looked better and Moira Orfei's color coordinated wigs are a real hoot. If you are a fan of the genre this is certainly worth the price. The one downside to this DVD is the very abrupt ending.,1490054400,,622,4.370689655172414
