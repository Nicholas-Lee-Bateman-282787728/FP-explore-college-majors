8258866,5,B0015KLHCY,I wouldn't have ordered it if I didn't want to see it. A nostalgic fave as there is nothing else worth watching nowadays on tv.,1356307200,,127,4.12
8258867,3,B0015KLHCY,"A 1972 Depatie Freleng series for NBC, featuring dogs and cats who
fight crime despite various pitfalls and pratfalls. Stutz is the
fearless leader, Putty Puss the master of disguise; Mussel Mutt
the big, burly sheepdog, Rhubarb the inventor, and so on. These
four cartoons are good for nostalgia purposes--not extremely funny
but the characters and situations are charming and it was good
voice casting (Michael Bell, Aldo Ray, Arte Johnson, Joe Besser, etc.)

Doug Goodwin's theme and incidental music are catchy. The first cartoon
on here features a 10 year old cowboy-clad boy (voice of Don Messick)
and that's the age I was when this show first aired. And the humor
might work best for kids of that age or so--though someone my age can still
enjoy it.",1206576000,,756,4.8604651162790695
8258868,5,B0015KLHCY,"I LOVE The Houndcats!! I'm so happy they're out on a DVD! Not a very special or cool DVD maybe, but still I'm really happy about it!!!

For those who don't know The Houndcats is about these cat and dog secret agents who would go on missons to stop evil. 2 of them were cats and the other 3 were dogs.
They would recive messages via recorded tapes by their chief and they would always self-destruct in a diffrent way in every episode. And they would trick the villians with clever plans instead of beating them up (probably because of the rising concern of too much violence on television during the time the show was made).

The Houndcats were: Stutz the leader of the Houndcats who was a cat and he was usually cool and confident (altough sometimes he would get cranky with the other Houndcats) and he was the planner. He sounds an awful lot like Don Adams. And he's a good-looking guy. He's got a great smile. Stutz was voiced by Michael Bell.

Dingdog who's a dog and Stutz's right hand man. He was also 2nd in command and he was the daredevil too. However, he had very rotten judgement on almost everything.
But, he's really cute though and his civl war uniform makes him look really handsome. Dingdog was voiced by Stu Gilliam.
Ding's my 2nd favorite character next to Rhubarb.

Mussel Mutt was the muscle of the group. He loved to eat food.(I don't blame him for that) and joke around in fact all the Houndcats liked to joke around.
But he wasn't exactly the brightest bulb in the box.
He was a sheepdog and had a hoarse husky voice. Mussel Mutt was voiced by Aldo Ray.

Putty Puss was the master of diguse. And Putty Puss is a cutie pie!!! And he has a funny voice too. Putty Puss was voiced by Joe Besser best known as Curly in The 3 Stooges.

And last but certainly not least is my personal favorite RHUBARB!!! Rhubarb was the geinus inventor who was capable of inventing anything anywhere anytime. He wore a long green coat and had a whole bunch of gadgets in it. And I think he's really handsome.*blushes* Maybe it's because of how his huge sombrero covered his eyes, or his cute lisp, or his smart yet cool laid back personality or maybe even his cat-like whiskers. *sigh*
Anyway he was voiced by Arte Johnson. But in three episodes Rhubarb was voiced by Daws Butler.

I also loved the theme song. In fact I can play the first few notes of the song on the piano!
So remember: Any time there's a rumble out West who are you gonna call? You call the best! Cause everyone knows it's simple as that the best in the West is THE HOUNDCATS!!!!",1205020800,2,2548,4.3742071881606766
