452901,5,6302309603,"This little known film has the kind of imperfections that make it endearing.  But it is much more than that.  If The Impressionists had made films, they would have made this one.  It is beautifully and tenderly directed, with attention to detail.  It is subtle in its nuiances, and startling in its conclusion.  Marianne Basler is perfectly cast.  She lives every moment in her senuous body,but can she remain in it when she is a marked woman?  Be patient with the opening scenes.  Gabriel Byrne  paces his performance.  By the end you realize it is as honest as the character he plays - a plain British soldier, warts and all.
Lust and war have brought these two together, and wrought their circumstances.  Love will resolve their dilema. When all hope is gone, only the gift of dignity remains.
This is not a war story, but it does throw into relief the vulnerability of woman in war - especially the young.  And it hammers home the tragic brutality of war, for men and women alike.  Rich in symbolism, yet simple in the telling, this story does not allow you to take sides - it is so deeply human.
The artistic direction is stunning, as is the location in France.
A Soldier's Tale belongs in any serious collection.",1356825600,,1218,4.583333333333333
452902,4,6302309603,"'A Soldier's Tale' released in '89 is a surprisingly good, little known film about a WWII soldier named Saul (Gabriel Bynes) who moves in with Blle, a beautiful woman (Marianne Basler)while his platoon is temporoary camped outside a French town recently occuppied by the Nazis.

Will her desert and stay to protect her, find her a safe house where she will be protected or leave her to whatever fate awaits?

Hard hitting, honest look at the unexpected casualities of war and the colateral damage that takes place when the combatants move on.",1157587200,5,821,4.694444444444445
452903,5,6302309603,"NORMANDY: 1944. World War II. Imagine yourself a soldier doing what you know best; kill. You kill without feeling for you know if your guard drops then you too will be dead. Your unit stops for a period of rest and you wander through the area. A farm house comes into your view and you see a woman. Only God knows how long you have been without one. Here's one for the taking.
  Thus begins this complex story of a British soldier (Gabriel Byrne) whose encounter with an accused collaborator (Marianne Basler) stirs his passion and awakens within him feelings long buried. Transport yourself into time when war makes men into brutes, reduces religion to a mockery and denies  people their humanity.
  Gabriel Byrne and Marianne Basler give a remarkable performance as two accidental lovers caught up in the whirlwind of war in which there are no black and white answers. Your heart will be throbbing as you witness the dynamics of this couple. Themes of betrayal, objectification of women and lust emerge from this tale. This saga is outstanding in dealing with the emotions of soldiers, civilians and the church in a war which turns everything upside down. Witness this drama.",985132800,26,1177,4.806930693069307
452904,5,6302309603,"I watched this movie with no preconceived ideas and found myself drawn into the drama.  Gabriel Byrne was superb as the soldier who comes to realize that all situations are not black and white even those that become life and death.  Marianne Basler was also superb as the French girl whose great sin was loving a German soldier in the early days of the French Occupation.
I loved this movie, it was interesting and thought provoking.  I highly recommend it.",971740800,10,457,4.6875

7824276,5,6302309603,"very good movie I thought; I liked the cinamatography and the lighting, and editing,etc. It's fast paced, without feeling  too hurried, hyped up, or so fast that you can't appreciate the tenderness and poignancy of some of the more sweet, or romantic moments in the film.  I thought the story very romantic, and the shocking ending makes the story even more poignant.  Very handsome boy, meets pretty girl.  It's a good movie",1400198400,,425,4.861111111111111
7824277,2,6302309603,"From the goofy American soldier, who portrays the entire American Army & Americans for that matter as a bunch of innocent, gum chewing nitwits to the rape, and finally killing of Belle, the movie is a poor portrayal of wartime France or anywhere else. If Belle was homely, would any soldier care? Suffered through.
If you want a wartime drama, watch ""The Pianist""",1378771200,,363,4.777777777777778
7824278,1,6302309603,The scenery and locale were ideal. But the film was totally illogical in many ways. The ending was completely unlikely and extremely disturbing. It does not follow a reasonable conclusion. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.,1367971200,2,232,5.131578947368421
