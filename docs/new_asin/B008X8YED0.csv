8531665,5,B008X8YED0,"I watched this little film on television and was moved and impressed with it so I now have a copy on DVD!  It has a lot of historical information, an original soundtrack which helps keep a thought-provoking atmosphere, interesting imagery and gives a moving and accurate account of the Countess of Salisbury's life.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in the Tudors and Blessed Maragret Pole and especially Mary Tudor whose Godmother Margaret Pole was.  I also heard about this film through the Richard III Society.  It plays very well and is clear and absorbing and runs for half an hour.  Very good.  I really like it.",1344902400,6,629,4.777777777777778
