5494887,5,B00ARPS5KU,"I recorded this onto VHS, when it first came out on HBO, but playing it for 30 years, sadly, made the video quality unbearable. When DVDs came out, I looked and even wrote snail mail letters to HBO, never hearing back. After GOOGLE came along, I only found others also searching. Then finally, my search said Amazon had it! I bought it and eagerly waited. I had built it up so much, I wondered if it would still be as terrific as I remembered, and it WAS! Sure it looks like the 80's! It was, and that just adds to the hilarity. Some will find Buddy's words offensive (that is even part of the performance) but this is classic Buddy Hackett and it is so funny, I cry laughing, every time.",1381708800,3,688,4.259541984732825
5494888,5,B00ARPS5KU,"Again, it shows more of his act then the youtube videos, so I can enjoy it in high definition quality.",1378166400,,102,4.15
5494889,5,B00ARPS5KU,"This review is for the dvd called Live and Uncensored 2.

Also comes in a Thin Slim Case as v1.

This ran 59m i rate this excellent+ you also get 3 xtras with this and here they are.
Sandy interviewing his dad from 1988-23m-found this very interesting.

REPEAT:Stanley-Warming up the television audience-7m

Stanley-Tv show-Celia's Pen Pal,again with Carol Burnett-24m-also on hand is Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Renie Riano known as Molly Turgiss from Green Acres who was in the episode calld |The Ballad of Molly Turgiss| pretty cool.

Again this has a clear picture and sound is as it should be.

I highly recommend this particular v2 over v1,but it's good to have both.",1370736000,2,669,4.824561403508772
5494890,5,B00ARPS5KU,"Those were his words, not mine.  Finally we have the great Buddy Hackett in all his glory and it's about time.  He was one of the last of the great story tellers who related to, respected and appreciated his audience.  The very real deal and a wonderful man. Buy both DVDs, Volume 1 and Volume 2, today!",1366243200,2,303,4.280701754385965

5494900,5,B00ARPS5KU,Outrageously funny.  Buddy Hackett at his best.  Strong language seems much tamer when delivered by Hackett with his cherubic face and innocent demeanor.  Puts most of today's comics to shame.  His humor is timeless.,1388534400,,216,5.264705882352941
5494901,5,B00ARPS5KU,"Even though he used some flowery language now and again no one seemed to be offended because everybody loved him. He was very REAL and an icon in the business. I believe he set the standards for guys like Bill Cosby, Bill Engvall, and many other comedians who felt they didn't have to use dirty words to be funny.",1385942400,2,313,4.322033898305085
