The production values and choreography are unsurpassed. It's a safe bet Carlos Acosta will be choreographing more ballets in the future. Fortunately the BD doesn't have the real-time intermissions the theater presentation did. :)

After finally receiving the Blu-ray from Amazon, I can only say Amen to the thorough review by I. Giles.  The extra feature of Carlos explaining his views and presenting rehearsal footage really adds to the production, displaying the work behind the dancing, enhancing appreciation of the cast.",1395792000,10,697,5.3090909090909095

6284822,4,B00IPDJN1Q,"My all time favorite version of this ballet is the ABT with Baryshnikov and Cynthia Harvey.  This version retains some of the original choreography, but I found the pace a bit slow.  An attempt at new scenery was not to my liking - too much moving around was distracting to the story.  Worth watching if you're a fan, but I'll probably stick to my old favorite.",1411948800,2,361,4.4393939393939394
6284823,5,B00IPDJN1Q,"Definitely one of my favourite ballets! Royal Ballet Guest Principle artist Carlos Acostas new Production of Don Quixote is a colourful, vibrant and energetic version of the famous ballet.
Marianela Nunez as Kitri completely stole the show, she was born for this role! Nunez played off `kitris fun yet cheeky nature brilliantly. Carlos Acosta charmed as Basilio, both had flawless technique and there was definitely an obvious natural chemistry between the two.
The choreography was very energetic and daring, with Acosta having dancers dance on tables and vocalizing the dancers with onstage cheering. The use of castanets and flamenco guitarists playing live onstage added to the Spanish feel, setting this revival aside from other versions.

The costumes were also beautifully designed, complementing the choreography whilst still maintaining the Spanish atmosphere of the ballet.

As usual the orchestra were fantastic and skillfully perfomed Ludwig Minkus score, which was re-orchestrated by Martin Yates.

Having already seen this live at the Opera House and now on DVD, the camera angles of the DVD allow the viewer to appreciate the background characters and set design as well as see more detail of choreography that would be harder to see at a live performance from an amphi seat. The DVD also played with very clear sound so the music could also be enjoyed.

The DVD also includes fantastic extra features such as interviews with dancers and an included synopsis of the ballet in a variety of languages so viewers can gain a better understanding of the ballet.

With amazing energy and humour this is the perfect ballet for absolutely anyone to watch!",1410825600,2,1662,5.209737827715355
6284824,5,B00IPDJN1Q,"Good Blu-ray products.

One of the best Don Quixote musical album.

It is a bang for bucks, too.

Anyone is looking for Don Quixote, I strongly recommend this album",1410220800,,164,4.586206896551724
6284825,5,B00IPDJN1Q,"My absolute favourite ballet! I have seen it both live at the Opera House and on DVD and the DVD gives you something that I would have never got In my seat at the Opera House.
You get to see the emotion on the dancers faces, and every small detail of the challenging choreography which really allowed me to appreciate every aspect of the ballet (possibly the reason behind my enthusiasm).

Marianela (Kitri), is an absolute delight to watch and the chemistry between her and Carlos (Basilio) make them perfect partners. Their performances were simultaneously effortless and powerful which made Don Quixote such a joy to watch. The musical score by Ludwig Minkus was fantastic and similarly as lively and exuberant as the dancers!

Aside from giving a view point I would have never have seen from my usual Amphi seat the DVD had some brilliant extra features including interviews with the cast and crew and a synopsis of the ballet which I found particularly useful.

I absolutely love the humour, the energy, and the Latin spirit of Don Quixote. It showcases the very best of ballet and is fantastic for those who perhaps are new to ballet.",1406332800,3,1140,4.747474747474747
6284826,5,B00IPDJN1Q,"I am very pleased with this product. This DVD is produced by Opus Arte, the Royal Opera Houses own arts production and Distribution Company. It comes with a leaflet (translated in French and German) that features list of cast, a short article and synopsis of the ballet. The DVDs extra features include interviews with the cast and crew, introduction to Acts II and III and the cast gallery. It offers an interesting inside to the production as well as behind the scenes footage.

This production premiered at Royal Opera House in London in 30th September 2013. It is very lively and energetic. The casts performance is top quality, most notably starring Carlos Acosta as Basilio, Marianela Nuez as his love interest  Kitri and Christopher Saunders as Don Quixote.  The great chemistry between Acosta and Nuez makes it so pleasurable to watch.

Apart from starring in the production Acosta also choreographed it. This production is full of humour and liveliness. The choreography is very energetic. Acosta is not afraid to make the dancers jump on tables or dance with props. The resemblance of the Spanish temper makes the production all the more enjoyable.

As well as the great performance from the dancers it is important to note the great amount of work that has gone into the set design and costumes. The simply beautiful dresses highlight and compliment the dancers while the Torero look magnificent with costumes with great detailing of gold ornaments. The set design changes often adding further dynamics to the story.

This production moves you into the beautiful world of Don Quixote  full of Spanish energy, young love, toreros, gypsies and fighting. The music by Ludwig Minkus is what really makes this performance a true spectacle.

I highly recommend this product to everyone as it is a great, modern production that should not be missed. This DVD is a great alternative to international ballet lovers who don't have the opportunity to travel to the Royal Opera House in London. I was very lucky to be able to see this production live last year and now thanks to this DVD I am able to return to it anytime I want in own home. It has allowed me to fully appreciate the details of the production that I missed when I first saw it. Watching the ballet at home rather than live gives the opportunity to pause and re-watch favourite scenes such as the dream sequence which I could watch over and over again.",1405900800,,2417,4.821256038647343

6284828,5,B00IPDJN1Q,"Having seen this production live last year, I was concerned that watching it again on DVD would not be able to capture the same magic. Whilst it was not the same as seeing it live, the filming gave a completely different perspective to my amphitheatre seat, allowing me to really appreciate the detail and beauty of the production.

The DVD itself is beautifully packaged and quick to arrive. Inside it features a useful synopsis, cast list and short article about the ballet in English, French and German, alongside some production photographs. Coupled with an interesting introduction to the ballet, which can either be played between acts or as an extra feature, plenty of information is available to help new viewers understand the production, as well as give those who are familiar a new insight.

The filming is simply excellent. Whilst the camera does inevitably constrain ones gaze, the seamless transition between camera angles ensures that the viewer can appreciate both the whole and the detail. I particularly enjoyed seeing the intricacies of the dancers acting - from the villagers chatting on the balcony to the realistic and never overemphasised facial expressions of the main characters, this was a perspective I never would have gained without sitting at the front of the stalls. Even on my laptop, both the filming and the sound are crisp and clear, with an option for surround sound.

The production is a real credit to Royal Ballet Principal Guest Artist and choreographer Carlos Acosta (Basilio). Don Quixote marks his first foray into classical choreography for the Royal Ballet after a departure into more contemporary work, and he certainly does not disappoint  the performance has real excitement and raw energy, even if it means the synchronisation of some of the faster steps is at some points a little out amongst the group dances. Acosta finds the right balance between Marius Petipas original choreography, athleticism and more modern elements, such as the floor work performed by the gypsies and the use of on stage sound. This is fully embraced by the company, and particularly by Marianela Nuez (Kitri), Ryoichi Hirano (Espada) and Laura Morera (Mercedes), who all embody a strangely endearing Spanish cockiness that shows their love of dancing and makes for a truly entertaining production from start to finish. Whilst the Garden of the Dryads scene in Act II gives classical ballet fans their fix of a tutu-clad ethereal corps de ballet, the ballet is dominated by a more modern strength that gives both the men and women a chance to shine and show off. In particular, Acosta pulls out some show-stopping ticks in the wedding scene, and Nuezs turns and leaps throughout are effortless she is a true joy to watch, and the camera captures her skill beautifully.

Overall, this is a DVD that I would highly recommend to new and old audiences of all ages. It is a truly ravishing production that shows ballet at its best and leaves you with a smile on your face, and having this preserved on DVD for you to pause and rewind ensures that you can continue to relive the best bits.",1403568000,3,3110,4.938814531548757
6284829,5,B00IPDJN1Q,"I was lucky enough to see this production when it was shown in cinema's in the live feed from the Royal Ballet.  i was not disappointed.  Carlos Acosta may not be at the beginning of his career any more but that man sure can dance and in this staging his love of the story is evident.  He also gives us a more in-depth look at Don Quixote than we normally get.
Marianela Nunez is in her element.  Laura Morera shines as the street dancer.
I think Carlos chose a great way to bring his view of staging and choreography to a ballet that he has danced many times over the years and I hope the DVD includes some of the ""specials"" we were able to see in the live feed.",1398729600,,663,4.076923076923077
6284830,5,B00IPDJN1Q,"This recording from 2013 marks Acosta's first offering as producer and choreographer for the Royal Ballet and this version of the ballet is markedly different in emphasis to other options currently available on disc. The first performance of the ballet was relayed 'live' via cinemas in October and received considerable acclaim in the press which reflected the audiences obvious enthusiasm. This review is based on the received Blu-ray disc rather than either the 'live' cinema broadcast or attending the Royal Ballet in London.

The first thing to note therefore is the outstanding quality of the Blu-ray disc which provides complete clarity of imaging and DTS surround sound of depth and fidelity. The camera work expertly blends the panoramic range of views with the closer detail that would be hard to see for those present at the actual performance on stage. The disc therefore offers a satisfying 'best of all words' combination of views.

The presentation itself is traditional in style in so far as it is fully staged with attractive and imaginative use of staging and props which move in and out smoothly to enhance the flow of the stage activity. Costumes are stylish and suitably Spanish in design while the dream sequence in Act 2 and the final set of dances between Acosta and Nunez are both taken as opportunities to display classical ballet costuming such as tutus and long flowing white dresses.

The production is a clear attempt to bring in far more of the story detail than in other productions. The supporting roles of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza (Christopher Saunders and Philip Mosley), Espada and Mercedes (Ryoichi Hirano and Laura Morera), Gamache and Lorenzo (Bennet Gartside and Gary Avis), Dulcinea and the Queen of the Dryads (Chistina Arestis and Melissa Hamilton), Kitri's two friends (Yohui Choe and Beatriz Stix-Brunell) and the Matadors and Urchins are all considerably enhanced with roles of dignity rather than the more comic portrayals to be found elsewhere.

There is far less of the display element and more concentration on deeper characterisation than is often the case and this adds up to a more serious telling of the story with less emphasis on the spectacular or pyrotechnic display that can be witnessed in other productions such as on the recent Mariinsky and Cuban National Ballet discs.

The main casting of Carlos Acosta as Basillo and Marianela Nunez as Kitri is a total success and their chemistry on stage is palpable throughout. This is vivid evidence of that natural empathy that is described by Acosta and Nunez in the bonus feature film. Both possess rock solid technique to which is added the essential ability to communicate with each other and with the audience and that is what makes their portrayal come alive so well. The Matadors are given more substantial roles and gain in stature as a result. The corps de ballet clearly enjoy themselves in this production and that enthusiasm communicates well on disc.

Acosta has introduced a limited degree of vocalising in the form of cheers and encouragement from the dancers on-stage. Use is also made of table tops as temporary focal points to extend the staging and to add authenticity to some scenarios. These features have been incorporated with the intention to extend the National and dramatic characterisation of the narrative.

The roles of Quixote and Sancho Panza gain by being more seriously portrayed as do the roles of Gamache and Lorenzo. Kitri's two friends make for delightful entr'actes and the less comically silly portrayals of Gamache and Lorenzo are a welcome change. Espada is a strong character and the parallel romance between him and Mercedes is well portrayed and adds depth to the production.

The music is still by Minkus but has been re-orchestrated and modernised by the conductor, Martin Yates. The orchestra played with their usual skill and high quality and contributed strongly to the success of the evening. There is a 12 minute film with interviews from the cast during which the intentions of the new production are well covered. The disc can be played with or without introductions before each act.

This is therefore a very fine recording of a thoughtful new production that looks set to be a regular feature of the Royal ballet repertoire.
This disc is a successful and involving record of the live performance and deserves to be seriously considered by potential purchasers.",1398211200,17,4423,5.039671682626539

8644464,2,B00IPDJN1Q,"Good dancers are not always good choreographers. Don Quixote is a classical ballet and choreography for this ballet should be as close
to the original one. Mr. Acosta had good intentions but the final result
was not successful. First Act looked amateur, costumes looked washed out because of the colors and the female dancers wore mostly aprons and flat shoes, not enough toe shoes. At times I thought I was watching a dance recital. Espada and Don Quixote dancers were  miscast and Mercedes was forgettable (I particularly like Miss Morera). The gypsy act was too dark and dancers were mostly rolling on the floor. And Acosta's effort to have live music on stage failed because the guitar players were in the dark. The dream scene was good because the soloists were excellent. Too much red in the background. The tavern scene had this dancer again playing Espada who was a total miscast. Principals danced well. Sets were imaginative and the orchestra played concert style without enough strength and too slow at times making the ballet boring. I think Mr. Acosta should stick to dancing and leave choreography alone. The Royal Ballet is one of my favorite ballet companies and this Don Quixote must go into the company's vaults. Nureyev's version of this ballet is the best one so far. I think I paid too much money for a mediocre version of this exciting ballet. The disc was excellent with good sound and video but the ballet was not worth buying.",1415577600,3,1451,4.804
