1681355,5,B000060MU7,"I saw this in Oslo in the original Norwegian with English subtitles. I hope this version isn't dubbed... It's one of the great movies that I have seen... I realized a few days after I saw it that the movie is actually a documentary, but it didn't feel like a documentary when I saw it, so I didn't even notice that that's what it is. I've never seen anything quite like it. In a small fishing village far North of the Arctic Circle in Norway, there's by some miracle a men's choir. This is just a look into the lives, thoughts and even bodies of a group of very ordinary, mostly middle-aged men whose livelihood is not easily won. The climate in this village is harsh to say the least. And to keep their sanity this choir was formed I think early in the 20th Century, and has continued to this day. The movie masterfully contrasts the very human lives of these men with the unearthly music that they come together every week to make for what audiences this village has to offer. And it does this without any commentary... the movie consists wholly of film clips of the singers being fed dinner by their wives, or in the bathtub discussing their first loves, or discussing how they love the water while they're out on their fishing boats... or arguing politics. I hadn't laughed so hard in a long time... it's a film with great heart and great hope.",1029542400,14,1348,4.417670682730924
1681356,4,B000060MU7,"This is a documentary film, but set within such a tight, small-town scene that you find yourself treating choirmembers as though characters (indeed, personal family members) in a naturalist drama.  Compare this film to ""Buena Vista Social Club"" (Habana's Malecon, etc.) and you'll find occasional scenes and details hilarious.  Given the featherweight subtlety of this work (some have compared it to watching paint dry), insignificant occurances strike like lightning bolts out of the calm, and shock, surprise, or worry us.  Okay - I'll reveal the moment of highest tension - when the group takes off in a bus toward Murmansk (?) to perform in public, I was as anxiety-stricken as though my own family members were on their way and I feared failure and embarrassment, etc.  Darn it, they just didn't seem ready for the big stage!
The film left me hoping for more works in this derivative (Social Club) style - and imagining other possibilities.  Still, to appreciate this film, det hjaelper om du aer norskaetling (it helps to be of norwegian or scandanavian origin)!  For optimal viewing, a cold, snowy winter night and a few glasses of akvavit, too, might be in order, along with a pile of furs and a fire in the hearth... and members of Chicago's Polar Bear Club might enjoy it after their annual naked jump through the ice on Lake Michigan (do they still do that?)... or it could be viewed after Fargo, though that's not one of my favorites...",1023408000,6,1448,4.842105263157895
1681390,3,B000060MU7,"Being a big thriller fan, I eagerly picked this DVD up, but it wasen't at all what I expected.  First of all, it takes places in the 50s althought the Film is from 1994.  That by itself would certainly not be a reason to regret buying it.  The story sounded good and intriguing, but unfortunately it can't deliver its promises.  The main problem is that the plot, especially seen from todays perspective, is too trite and clich
like.  The plot goes something like this: A young couple, just out of high school gets married far too soon for their own good, but they both believed that being married would mean freedom and independence for themselves.  The young wife called Roslyn, played by Alicia Silverstone, soon gets bored with being at home all the time and waiting for her husband to come home in the evening. Her best friend soon tells her that she is having an affair although she's also married - remember these are the 50s when something like that was considered utterly wrong and disgraceful. Anyways, the friend soon persuades Roslyn to join her on her nights out with other boys.  Of course these boys are the absolut wrong types to talk to let alone go out with.  Soon Roslyn's husband, played by Jared Leto, begins to suspect that his wife is cheating on him and starts to follow her around.  Well, I guess you get the way the story is going.  Needless to say, I don't want to spoil it by telling everything, but to be fair I must say that this movie felt more like a TV film than a real movie.
Nonetheless, if you have nothing better to do than watching it and spending some 80 Minutes with it isen't such a bad decision, although I would rate it as rather being in between a good and average film.",1219190400,6,1714,4.429936305732484
1681391,5,B000060MU7,"This movie is very nice and instructive story about young married couples. First of all, when I finished watch this movie I thought: Don't marry straight after school. Jared Leto young and beautiful.",1202601600,,199,5.0606060606060606
1681392,4,B000060MU7,"My wife hated this film, but I loved it. Not sure why exactly, as it has lots going against it.

The film focuses on a few of the 30-odd members of the Berlevag Men's Choir. They live in a small arctic fishing village on the northern tip of the Norwegian coast, and seem to have no lives to speak of other than their involvement in the choir. A couple of the older gents (the 96-year-old kind of old) have wives, but the rest seem to live in mateless isolation. The film alternates between handheld monologues (in which the men talk about themselves) and set pieces in which the choir -- dressed in bowties, parkas or natty sailing caps -- sing of the natural glories of Scandinavia whilst perched comically upon enormous gasoline tanks, along the winter-whipped Atlantic, or enshrouded in beard-encasing blizzards. The men are quite ordinary -- a fisherman who giggles as he pulls his catch from the sea; a former druggie; a self-styled communist who weeps when pondering wartime Russian sacrifice; an irreverent, foul-mouthed (and fumble-fingered) church organist. On their way to a concert, all (except for the communist) stare aghast at the environmental devastation of the Murmansk industrial area. Dwellers in a land with a harsh beauty, they are clearly in love with it and inured to its limitations, both social and scenic.

I found these men fascinating and their music beautiful. Unintended ironies abound. The men sing of the beauty of pine bough and flower blosssom in a place that is stark and unforgiving much of the year. They sing of church in a land where religion seems to have no hold on anyone. The most beautiful thing they have is their spare Nordic furnishings and their camaraderie. Somehow, though, of all of this coalesces into a film that held my attention and made me love this group of very real, very special men.",1180396800,2,1843,4.7924528301886795
1681393,1,B000060MU7,"So I read the review for this movie and it sounded like it was going to be an entertaining B rated moive. I'm a huge Jared Leto fan and love pretty much every movie Alicia Silverstone has been in so I had high hopes. Well I put it on last night since I just received it from Amazon on Monday and boy was I ever disappointed. The review above mine gives a good depiction of the storyline but this movie was terrible. I found myself watching it to see if there was a chance of it getting better... it didn't. The highlight of this movie was getting to see Jared shirtless. It was long and drawn out with too many stupid, back and forth type scenes which left me begging for the movie to just end. The acting wasn't great and although the storyline sounded good, wasn't successfuly executed. If anyone is interested in this movie to see Jared in his younger, acting days I'd suggest checking out something other than this.",1161648000,11,919,4.348837209302325
1681394,5,B000060MU7,"This is a story about the ""traditional"" paradigm of a young woman whose life has gone astray.  Alicia Silverstone plays an All American beauty, girl-next-door type - the prom queen type who was popular in high school.  She marries young, has a child and immediately finds herself.....bored.  Her husband is a good man, but works long hours to support his family.  What's a girl to do?

The story takes place apparently in the late 1950s.  This is appropriate for a couple of reasons.  First of all, at this time it was still normal for the man to be the breadwinner and the woman to be a housewife.  This concept is almost un-heard of today in dual-income families.

Second, this was the hey-day of the ""bad boy"" types.  The fellows who are 10 time losers but believe themselves to be cool.  The bullies who think they're tough by having 5 of their friends beat someone up.  As you've probably guessed by now, our prom queen has too much time on her hands and gets seduced by a punk.

The timing is also consistent as the late 1950s were on the eve of the sexual revolution and the idea of ""free love"" that came into its own in the 60s.  Some allusions to this are made as well.

While the plot of this movie may sound like a Romantic comedy, it is not.  It's a drama.  It's about a turbulent time in the social fabric of American history, when women ceased being ""satisfied"" as stay-at-home mothers, and economic conditions forced them not to be such.",1153612800,10,1452,4.4600760456273765
1681395,2,B000060MU7,"I have read several reviews that ask the question, ""Why was this film made""?  I myself found that question looming in my mind as the hour and twenty minute feature seemed to drag near the middle, only to give off the sensation that it was picking up steam at the end, when in actuality it was doing nothing of the sort.  So, ""Why was this film made""?  I think that is a great question for those watching Heftig og begeistret to ask themselves.  This reviewer is proud of director Knut Erik Jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope, brotherhood, and inspiration with this all male choir, but I do not think that Jensen did enough to bring a gripping story to the table.  Let me pose this question to you, ""Do audience members need more in a documentary than just a straight forward story to maintain interest""?  My answer is yes, and this is where Jensen failed.  Heftig og begeistret was a good documentary, but it was far from great.  Jensen did a horrible job with the story and dedication of the subjects.  It was great to hear the songs, but over time, those songs seemed dull, overwhelming, and a bit precocious.  From the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts out in a blinding snow, I knew that I was hooked, but as the film developed I lost interest.  Why?  Jensen never took us, the audience members, to the next level.  He kept the playing field level and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film.  Was this a movie about the music or about the men in the choir?  The world may never know.

Again, I would like to state that Jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen hard times and how they coped with that through music, but it was as if the all male choir were a bunch of the most boring men ever created.  Jensen gave us the music superbly, but it was the characters, the subjects, that I knew nothing about by the end of the film.  In the mix we had a 97 year old man who still had his driver's license, we had a large man in a tub singing classic American songs, we had old men who were once heartthrobs in their youth, we had some tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers, and we even had an ex-drug addict that had only been clean for eleven years.  Did Jensen develop these interesting stories at all?  Nope, he left them on the table.  It was obvious that these singers were willing to talk further about it (see the political man who missed his political days), but Jensen seemed to clear away from those heartfelt moments and head straight back into interesting places that he could have the choir sing.  To me, the music was defined at the beginning of the film, I wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these individual men.  They were all captivating, yet Jensen seemed to ignore them completely.

By ignoring the major subjects of this documentary, Jensen became unsuccessful in creating any sort of tension towards the end.  Without giving the ending away, I felt like Jensen was coloring in the lines.  Instead of being bold outside the lines, he chose to create no moment of sympathy, emotion, nervousness, or sadness.  Jensen took our subjects from point A to point B to point C without asking us to become involved in any way shape or form.  I can see how national sentiment had made this film into a huge success in Norway, but for everyone else watching (i.e. ME) more was necessarily needed.  I wanted to feel for these guys.  I wanted to know if they were going to do well as they traveled, or just find themselves loved in their own city.  There was no story, mostly in part to no development of the subjects.  When you watch modern documentaries (oddly, this film was made in 2001), you want it to play out similar to any Hollywood feature film.  You want suspense, realism, and drama, alas, with Heftig og begeistret you get nothing of the sort.

Overall, I must ask the question again, ""Why was this film made""?  My final answer Alex, is that Jensen wanted to show how troubling times and a changing economy can still produce happiness in even the coldest places of Earth.  I think that Jensen wanted to show human dedication and how something as simple as singing can unite a population.  With that said, Jensen demonstrated that perfectly in this film, but he did not create a good documentary.  When you make a film of this nature, I feel that you must look within the group, examine the choir participants and hear each one of their stories to bring about an ending that will grip your heart.  The only thing that this film gripped was my attention span as it attempted to leave the room at rocket speed.  Again, I do not want to sound negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men singing did bring about a feeling of honesty, but I needed more.  With documentaries becoming a bigger staple of the film community, one expects a bit more than what Heftig og begeistret handed to us.  I want to see reality and people, not just another song and dance routine!

1681396,5,B000060MU7,"I adored this film. Like others, I found it slow at first, but once immersed in the lives of these remote villagers, I was hooked. It's heartbreaking, uplifting, funny, and inspirational. What a wonderful contrast to the life we lead in the corporate, TV-driven USA.  I'm sending it to all my (grown) kids.",1109635200,4,306,4.773584905660377
1681397,4,B000060MU7,"If you think Cool and Crazy is good, I recommend you check out another film from Scandinavia, Screaming Men by Mika Ronkainen. Yes, it's another film about a choir, but it's totally something you've never experienced before. It's a choir that screams national anthems and children's songs... Totally unique stuff!",1068508800,5,313,5.28
1681398,5,B000060MU7,"I love this movie.
perhaps it's because I lived in Finnmark, where it was filmed.
perhaps it's because I wandered Berlevg with some of those guys and they treated us to ice cream.
the scenery is beautiful, the guys are hilarious, and the singing is usually wonderful.  (only on a few songs are they slightly out of tune)",1051574400,8,320,4.517241379310345
1681399,4,B000060MU7,"Made in 2001, ""Cool and Crazy"" records the daily activities of the members of male choir group in Berlevog, Norway.  The town's population is about 1,200, and it is located at the seaside of the cold Nowegian Sea.
The film opens with a really surreal scene; the chorus members are standing upright by the stormy seaside (with many rugged rocks and splashing white waves), singing proudly in the blizzard.  Yes, the English title ""cool and Crazy"" is no exaggeration.  The group has several generations of singers, and many are working as fishermen there, or at the factory where they slice fish with machine.  This documentary film follows the life of a few selected members (the eldest being 96 years old), mainly those of the elder ones.
Just as ""Buena Vista Social Club"" did, the members tell their own life story before the camera; one of them recollects his first love; another his days as a drug addict in the past; or another his dream of becoming an entertainer or a scholar when he was young.  Among these interviews, you will hear them singing their numbers at various places, and the film ends with their tour to Russia, and the concert held there.
To be honest, as a documentary, ""Cool and Crazy"" is too slow to many of us (by ""us"" I mean most of the people outside Norway).  Though I know it has become a commercial hit in Norway, the film per se is not, I am afraid, as interesting as the subject matter itself.  The film introduces many engaging personalities of the people living there, but the way it presents them is not particularly engaging or original.  The film goes on very quietly, as if unwilling to step into the deeper emotions of the singers.  Many of them say they have nothing to regret, but it is true?  All you can do is accept their views, but that is the fashion the film adapted.  Probably we should respect the decision.
The film's greatest merit lies in the descriptions of the life of the people living in the small town of Norway, and in the occasional revelation of their own feelings about the place.  All of them are proud of their group, but each member's reaction to the life in the town betrays slight difference.  As a portrait of those very likable people, ""Cool and Crazy"" works best.",1037491200,16,2231,4.575376884422111

They sing and then they sing again, and we learn that there are two things that keep this coastal town from disappearing into winter: the town's breakwater, keeping the sea at bay, and this male chorus, feeding harmony to men of the sea.  You will feel this in your bones, especially if you love choir music as they do, and you will see how their need to breathe and sing together is a natural thing and a strength and a story of their lives.",1399161600,,563,4.242990654205608
