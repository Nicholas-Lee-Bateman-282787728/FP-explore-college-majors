7895795,4,6305826781,I remember watching this as a kid in the 70's and for some reason it seemed more serious back then LOL! It was worth seeing again for the memories and I got a kick out of how silly and campy the show was. The actting isn't the greatest either but this was just a kids Saturday morning show. It's a hoot to see it again after all these years!!,1060560000,4,342,3.971014492753623
7895796,5,6305826781,"One of my fondest memories of childhood was watching the Krofft show and especially Wonderbug. When I saw this tape was out I had to have it immediately. I was once again a 7 year old kid who cheered that beat up old car who turned into Wonderbug. ""When you hear the horn, help is on the way...""",970531200,2,295,4.103448275862069
7895797,5,6305826781,"I used to love  Saturday mornings because it meant two things;no school, and ""Krofft Superstars"" was on! I would watch faithfully every  week, enjoying the adventures of ""Land of the Lost"", ""Dr.  Shrinker"", ""The Bugaloos"", and my personal favorite,  ""Wonderbug"". You couldn't help but love the poor old beat up dune  buggy who wasn't in the best shape, but had a heart of gold. However, when  his sidehorn was honked, he transformed into a shiny, decked-out, flying  super machine who couldn't be beat. I hope they release more of the old Sid  and Marty Krofft shows as I know tons of people who were kids in the late  70's, early 80's have many fond memories of many Saturday mornings.  Besides, it was way better than the ""Teletubbies"" or any of the  other drivel they force on kids these days :) I only wish it was available  on DVD!",967507200,19,836,4.574324324324325
7895798,5,6305826781,If you ever saw the Krofft Supershow back in the late 70's you will fondly remember this super car. Good  clean fun from the Sid and Marty Krofft who  created some of the best family adventure shows around.,966556800,2,206,4.394736842105263
7895799,5,6305826781,"If you remember watching this little gem on The Krofft Supershow or Krofft Superstars,you should get this tape-it has 4 strong episodes of the series and is great fun to watch!  The episodes are really short [only 11 minutes  each],so it won't take you long to watch this tape-I give it my highest  reccomendation!",961027200,3,314,4.777777777777778
