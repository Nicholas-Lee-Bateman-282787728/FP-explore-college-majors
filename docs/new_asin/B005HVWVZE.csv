4705519,3,B005HVWVZE,"I am a huge fan for anything that has to do with treasure hunting- Indiana Jones, Fools Gold, National Treasure, you get the idea.  I was so excited to get this movie I could not wait.  It is a good movie- just not what I thought it would be.  The action is not fantastic and there are lags in the movie that make it hard to keep focused.  That being said it wasn't terrible and I will definitely be watching it again but it was not the action packed treasure hunting movie I like to normally add to my collection.",1327449600,,514,4.11
4705520,2,B005HVWVZE,"Jay Chou is a talented, chart-topping singer/musician from Taiwan.

Known in America for his role as Kato in the 2011 film ""The Green Hornet"", most of Jay Chou's previous films were films that I guess many people can call them ""growth"" films.  A musician turned actor who grows with each film.  Beginning with his starring role in ""Initial D"", starring with two powerhouse talent in ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" with Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li but to create more ""growth"" films with ""Kung Fu Dunk"" (2008), followed by ""The Treasure Hunter"" (2009).

And now, ""The Treasure Hunter"" receives its Blu-ray and DVD release in America courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.

VIDEO:

""The Treasure Hunter"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  The picture quality is quite warm and sports plenty of detail during the daytime, cooler colors during the night time.  Detail is very well-done as we can see the detail around the treasure relics, to the detail of the cool special effects featured in the film.  Black levels are deep and overall, picture quality for the film is very good.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Treasure Hunter"" is presented in Dolby TrueHD 2.0 Mandarin and English.  I was surprised that this film was only a 2.0 mix but for the most part, the front channels definitely get a lot of work in showcasing the many sound effects during the intense action sequences of the film.  From windstorms, to shrieks by possessed characters and more!

It's important to note that I did not listen to the English dub track as I prefer to watch Asian films in their original language.  With that being said, despite not liking English dialogue for Asian cinema, FUNimation Entertainment is well-known for their English dubs and doing a great work with them, so if you prefer English dubs instead of reading English subtitles, you do have that option.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""The Treasure Hunter"" comes with the following special feature:

EXTRAS:

""The Treasure Hunter"" comes with a slipcover case.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Another collaboration between Taiwan filmmaker Chu Yen-ping (""The King of Comics"", ""Kung Fu Dunk"") and music artist/actor Jay Chou plus popular Hong Kong action choreographer Ching Siu-tung (""A Chinese Ghost Story"" and ""Swordsman"" films), ""The Treasure Hunter"" was an interesting action film that tried to incorporate too much.

First, as mentioned earlier, this is a ""growth"" film for Jay Chou.  As a singer, he wanted to improve his acting, so he did a few popcorn action films, one was ""Kung Fu Dunk"" and the other was this film ""The Treasure Hunter"".  Needless to say, these two films are not the best, and while they are both flashy in different ways, they are primarily popcorn action films with a popular singer as the main star.

And while these two Chu Yen-ping films are good starting blocks for Jay Chou's acting and are literally stylish action films, while ""Kung Fu Dunk"" tried to capture the feel of ""Shaolin Soccer"" (which it failed to accomplish), ""The Treasure Hunter"" tries to be a martial arts Indiana Jones-style film with more plot holes than holes in Swiss cheese.

One thing that we know of the film is that Jay Chou plays a treasure hunter that returns the treasure back to their owners.  We know there is sexual attraction between treasure hunter Qiao Fei and his mentor's daughter Lan Ting.

The problem of the film is that it introduces a lot of things to the film that make no sense.  From the hoard of attacking warriors on the dune and they happen to be stuck inside a diner, its reminiscent of the American film ""Legion"" but what is their purpose, we don't know.  It seems that the film tried to incorporate one large action chase scene for action-sake, with nothing impacting the storyline.

Before the attack by the dune warriors, we see a soldier attacking Qiao Fei, but what is his purpose in the film?  Why even give this non-essential character a closeup.

And then all of a sudden, the film tries to become a zombie/vampire like film when Pork Chop's employees start eating flowers that have grown from a dead corpse, thus making him to a zombie with super abilities.

And while it was one thing to introduce these supernatural beasts or whatever they are, we are introduced to a storyline that revolves around a woman named Dao-Dao and the Desert Eagle, which plays an impact to the story in the beginning and about Qiao Fei's past.  But the brief interaction with Desert Eagle is so short that you wonder why the writer chose to introduce it to the storyline.

Unfortunately, as much as the film does look cool in terms of its warm colorized look and the visual effects, especially the fight choreography, the film was disappointing.

And what makes it even worse is that the film that Yen-ping Chu and Jay Chou did before this, was also the same.  Full of style, cool fight choreography but a storyline that tried to add to much but got nowhere.

The Blu-ray release is also ""OK"".  While the picture quality is very good, we are only given a Dolby TrueHD 2.0 soundtrack (Mandarin and in English) and for special features, just a single trailer.

Needless to say, Jay Chou fans are going to watch this film because it features Jay Chou.  But the film didn't do well in Taiwan and was a box office failure.  But since Jay Chou has become internationally well-known because of his work on ""The Green Hornet"", the collaboration between him and Yen-ping Chu for their second film together is another mess.

It's unfortunate because I respect Jay Chou as a fan of his music and I have been supportive of his growth as an actor, even when he first starred in ""Initial D"", but his two films with Yen-ping Chu may give him that acting experience but unfortunately they are bad films.  Again, these films were made before ""The Green Hornet"", so hopefully, he gets better film roles to star in.

""The Treasure Hunter"" is more eye-candy and a popcorn action-film with an anemic, kitschy storyline that is too confusing to be any good.",1323993600,,6060,4.7863330125120305
4705521,5,B005HVWVZE,"When it comes to action packed, big budget adventure movies, the things that really stick out are the things you see in the previews - action, adventure, peril, stunts, treasure!  This movie has all of these and more.

The first thing I noticed when watching this Blu-Ray is that the picture was outstanding.  Sharp, clean and the colors are great.

It opens with crazy martial arts action and special effects, which immediately hooked me.  The stunts in the movie were great, and like other reviewers have stated it definitely has more than a hint of The Mummy trilogy.  But, I didn't feel that is was ripping it off.  Action and adventure flicks will always be compared to Indiana Jones and The Mummy because for this generation, those films really set the bar for blockbuster adventure.  I didn't feel that this movie stole anything from either movie, just gave off the same fun vibe.

Yeah, the story was a teensy bit rocky, and I never felt ""stressed"" over the possible fate of any character (except Lan's father, he seemed nice!).  Sometimes that is a bummer, but I don't like letting my sappy emotions take over in this kind of film.  I just want fun!

The dialogue could have been a little better, but when translating Mandarin to English there is always the chance that some words will get muddled in the process.  I take it with a grain of salt; I understood what was going on and that was good enough for me.

Basically - I can more than deal with minor plot and dialogue imperfections when it comes to watching a fun movie like this.

I also appreciate the fact that this isn't your typical Indy/Mummy type of adventure.  It adds in the silliness that I love about Asian cinema and anime and mixes it well with the allure of treasure!

If you want a fun, action packed, visually stunning, treasure filled martial arts movie then I would highly suggest grabbing Treasure Hunter!  I do not regret my purchase of this Blu-Ray, in fact if I had paid double I would still be more than ecstatic about what I received.",1323043200,4,2023,4.572222222222222

8473678,5,B005HVWVZE,"Jay Chou is a legend. His overall successful career is further pushed along by this gem. Prior to knowing the extent of Jay's career, this movie showcases that enduring sense of humor that carries over into the less heart wrenching songs he writes. It's full of action, lore and goodies vs baddies with the occasional undead priest thrown in for good measure. Not one to be taken seriously, certainly one for all ages to enjoy!",1471219200,,427,4.706666666666667

Full of annoying characters, nonsensical scenes, totally meaningless and absurd ""plot,"" and an COMPLETE waste of time. With 31 minutes left, I could not take it anymore and dumped it.

See it if you want. If you were born after 1965 you will totally freaking LOVE it !

8473686,1,B005HVWVZE,"A nothing creative ripoff of ""The Scorpion King"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Masters of the Universe"" with Skeletor plastic masks for the bad people and horses. Badly fragmented storyline and editing where props and people suddenly appear on screen, out of the blue, as if the director forgot what he had just filmed. My favorite scene was the bad people on horseback trying to pull down a building by suddenly pulling a hundred feet of heavy steel chain and hooks out of their pockets. Most scenes made no sense such as the single dilapidated ""Rango"" style bar and inn located in the midst of a vast sand dune desert with telephone poles that go nowhere and with no road. A few moments later our heroes were in mountainous sheep grazing country and the back to the Sahara type desert. The English subtitle dialogue was so bad that what was being said made no sense relative to it's scene or in response to what someone else had said. Acting was robotic, martial art sword play was child like. The boringly usual wire suspended spinning kicks are just old, overused and were poorly executed in this case.",1332460800,,1095,4.678756476683938
