1721232,5,B000067J25,"Cathy Lee Crosby and Tom Arnold star in this fast-paced (albeit low-budget) thriller from cineschlocker Jim Wynorski.  No, the movie is not realistic, and the synopsis on the back of the box has nothing to do with the real movie, but it doesn't matter.  This is pure B-movie fun.  The DVD is in widescreen (1.85:1) with 5.1 surround sound that rocks your sound system.  The picture is crystal clear and the colors pop off the screen.  If you are into high camp (or just want to see a lot of people spontaneously combust), go ahead and buy or rent this one.  You may not think it the best movie in the world, but if you give it a chance, it's pretty entertaining.",1058400000,6,662,4.385245901639344
1721233,1,B000067J25,"This is abslutely one of the worst films ever produced. It represents everything wrong with Hollywoods attempts at making movies on fire and firefighters. I couldn't even finish watching this horribly acted and poorly directed movie, it was that bad. First of all they copied (almost exactly) a car chase scene from the beginning of Bruce Willis' ''Striking Distance''. In fact it would not surprise me if the scene was merely taken directly from this movie and added to the beginning of Ablaze. Secondly, the acting, well, let's just say it was worse than most soft-core XXX movies out there. Thirdly, real firefighting scenes were dropped into the movie to try and give it credibility but they were so poorly edited that it was blatantly obvious that they were not filmed for this movie. Lastly and most importnatly, the actual firefighting scenes were just deplorable, a real embarrassment to anyone in the firefighting profession. No SCBA's at all, large groups of men running into burning building with little more than an axe (last time I checked, water put out fires, not axes or bare hands), no gloves, running calls with trucks that would be out-of-service 30 years ago (obviously no Fire Department with an ounce of credibility would lend this picture their vehicles), etc, etc. When there was a scene of water being put on a fire, it was obvious that the fire was not part of the picture but added later as no water ever hit the building. Just really poor editing and effects. And this is only from watching less than half the film, I can't even imagine how much worse this movie gets. What ever you do, don't waste your time and money with this film, it is a disgrace and thoroughly embarrassing to watch, literally. It is unfortunate that some of the better actors in this film had the poor judgment to make this movie in the first place.",1044316800,,1851,4.733746130030959
1721234,1,B000067J25,"This has got to be the absolutely worst movie ever made.  We hardly need the general public thinking that this is what firefighting is about or that this is how it what we really do.  Anyone who knows anything about firefighting will be sorely disappointed.  It would make a great addition to any instructor's library when covering the DO NOT's of PPE and SCBA.  Added to a horrible storyline, acting, and effects, during most of the movie, you see firefighters running around without SCBA or proper PPE--maybe the production company was just too cheap to buy them.  Only later in the movie when the National Guard shows up do we see SCBA, but even they do not have the facepieces.  The front cover is very decieving--we see a trio of firefighters standing in front of a huge flame.  The amount of firefighting actually seen in the move is minimal, at best.  What is seen represents only the worst of firefighting technique.  I highly recommend that NO ONE buy this movie for anyone who knows even the slightest bit about what firefighting really involves.",1037404800,5,1056,4.726775956284153
1721235,5,B000067J25,"This is easily the greatest movie I have ever seen!  Never before have I laughed so hard or spent so much time saying, ""What in the....""  The story line is so well conceived, and I think the one described on the back of the box would make a great movie as well (since it has nothing to do with what actually happens in this movie).  I remember watching ""Outbreak"" and then it's comedy counterpart, ""Virus.""  Well this movie movie is easily the ""Virus"" to ""Backdraft.""  Seriously, rent this movie if you are a fan of ""Ace Ventura"" or ""American Pie"" because you will laugh harder than you ever have before.  Now I gotta go spontaneously combust like half the people in this movie!!!",1031875200,4,680,4.487804878048781
1721236,1,B000067J25,"Although I did not see it credited anywhere, this film is a cheap remake of a disaster movie called ""City on Fire"", which itself was not great. Some of the scenes (people falling, fire spreading along the surface of a canal) appear to be clips lifted from the earlier film. The plot has been changed marginally to focus on a firefighter rather than a doctor. Big deal. The original was better, which is not saying much. If it had been possible to give this film NO stars, I would have. Save your $$ for something worth it!",1028505600,,522,4.391752577319588
1721237,1,B000067J25,"The Story Line is Bad, Terrible Acting, Bad Script, Very Unrealistic, I would have given it a 0 star if that option was available.  It took me two days to completely struggle through the pain of watching this movie, and I rented it.  Unless you want to see how the fire services do not operate do not buy this movie!!  BTW, the back cover of the movie case explains a total different movie and is completely unrelated to this movie.",1028419200,2,432,4.375

1721260,2,B000067J25,"This movie was awefull. I thought that there was going to be some action like American Ninja, but there wasn't. This is about police chasing bad guys. Then one of the officers gets hurt and ends up in the hospital. Then an earthquake happens and there is fire all over the city. They are trying to get everyone out of the hospital to a safer place. There is gas leaks and explosions all over. I kept loosing interest in it and I real feel that this was a boring movie.",1398816000,,468,4.211111111111111
1721261,5,B000067J25,"I just finished watching this movie and I really enjoyed it, because I am a LONGTIME firebuff and enjoyed the story as well as the special effects, because it's always fun to see things in action packed fire films. Nothing else to say! :-)",1383264000,,239,4.454545454545454
1721262,1,B000067J25,"This is a so-so movie if you like watching fires and mayhem. But, the official synopsis of the movie has nothing to do with the movie! I understand if they had a low budget and hired green producers and directors, but what's the deal with the wording on the back? It says, quote: "" A DEADLY ARSONIST HOLDS A CITY HOSTAGE. A routine investigation into a hotel fire becomes a grisly discovery when evidence uncovered among the ash suggest the fire was planned. As more deliberately set blazes sweep across the city,local firefighters scramble to save as many lives as they can. But the body count is rising and soon it becomes clear that these fires are deliberate death traps-perfect infernos created by a Serial Arsonist turned Serial Killer. ""

Did they pay someone who was not even involved in making the movie and knew nothing about it, maybe one freaking dollar to write that? Whomever it was, he or she must have watched the first few minutes of it, seen an arsonist was sought by detectives, then fast forwarded it to see lots o' fire; then wrote the now infamous words. Just as confusing is the fact that no one seems to have checked on it for final editing or approval. So the movie was released with a review that had nothing to do with the movie. Impressive!

As for what the movie was really about, well- who cares? Doesn't this alone give you a clue as to the rest of it? I bought it for a dollar, and feel like I wasted my money. Next time I am drinking I plan to try watching it again--as a comedy.",1257724800,2,1512,4.396428571428571
1721263,4,B000067J25,"I concur with some of the opinions already mentioned. The cast was the redeeming factor. The Car Chase, in the opening scene, was directly from a Bruce Willis film, Striking Distance. Overall, for the viewer that enjoys a suspense filled film, with multiple plots, I recommend the film.",1236038400,2,286,4.979166666666667
1721264,1,B000067J25,"i didn't bother even to finish the film when i relized that the first ten munites of the movie's footage was taken from the movie "" striking distance"" (1993) starring bruce willis and sarah jessica parker, i mean the actual car chase footage in the city was taken from willis's movie and used in this lame movie!!!

i think that copyrights are in order for the original and should take some legal action against the director and producers.........",1122595200,2,447,4.730769230769231
1721265,2,B000067J25,"A MASSIVE FIRE SWEEPS THROUGH A CITY AND IT'S UP TO THE LOCAL FIREMEN TO SAVE AS MANY LIVES AS POSSIBLE. UPON LOOKING AT THE COVER FOR THIS FILM, ''BACKDRAFT'' IS PROBABLY THE FIRST MOVIE THAT'LL POP INTO YOUR MIND. WHILE THE MOVIE IS REALLY NOT A BACKDRAFT CLONE, IT'S JUST YOUR AVERAGE DISASTER MOVIE. LAZY WRITING, AMATEURISH ACTING, AND AN ALL TOO FAMILIAR PLOT KEEPS THIS MOVIE FROM BEING GOOD. YOU'LL MOST LIKELY ONLY RECOGNIZE THREE OF THE CAST MEMBERS, WHICH ARE; ICE-T [NEW JACK CITY], MICHAEL DUDIKOFF [THE AMERICAN NINJA MOVIES], AND TOM ARNOLD  [TV'S ROSEANNE]. OH, AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN RENTING OR BUYING THIS MOVIE BECAUSE ICE-T'S NAME IS ON THE COVER, THEN YOU REALLY MIGHT WANNA THINK TWICE ABOUT GETTING THIS. ICE ONLY HAS 2 SCENES IN THIS WHOLE MOVIE! EVEN TOM ARNOLD'S ROLE ISN'T THAT BIG! IF YOU'RE SERIOUSLY INTO DISASTER FILMS, GIVE THIS A TRY. BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE DISASTER FILMS, SKIP THIS MOVIE. IF YOU DECIDE TO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, YOU'RE NOT MISSING OUT ON MUCH OF ANYTHING.",1094774400,,1010,4.674157303370786
1721266,5,B000067J25,"I have to admit, I must be a kind of sucker for these disaster type films.  I have long admired firefighters for the great risks and macho savvy they always show in real life.  This isn't real life, but hey this is a movie, and I don't care if it's not the way the real firefighters work.  Director Jay Andrews brings nothing new to the venue, but I had fun watching all the pyrotechnics and seeing how our brave men respond, and the subsequent human interests.  I think model turned actor John Bradley acquitted himself nicely, as did Amanda Pays and Larry Poindexter.  Even Pat Harrington, Edward Albert and Tom Arnold did okay.  William Zabka continues to reign as direct to video villain.  Cathy Lee Crosby's character was totally off the wall, I never really understood why she was even in it??  Anyway, I enjoyed it, and that's what movies are to me.  Enjoyment in a fantasy world.",1076112000,3,887,4.563291139240507

At our station, we have even stolen the firefighters catch phrase, ""Nobody burns"" and use it on all our calls. The movie is now a mandatory watch for all new firefighters in my department. The appearance and performances of Tom Arnold, Ice T, and Kathie Lee Crosby are all award worthy.
