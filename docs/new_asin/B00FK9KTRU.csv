5994388,5,B00FK9KTRU,This was a really great movie about God and His love and power to changes lives of his children! Excellent!!,1389916800,,108,4.45
5994389,2,B00FK9KTRU,"Hard to find the words to say why, the movie was just kind of trashy. Rated PG, watched with my children. Surprised when they talked about sex. Sex is God created but don't like such mature subjects with young children. Like they tried to force a lot into small area so the movie just didn't flow well.",1389830400,3,302,4.315789473684211
5994390,2,B00FK9KTRU,"While I am appreciative that a movie with this plot line was considered by Hollywood, the very poor acting, misuse of Bible Scripture and church cliches made this movie a long, disappointing 2 hours",1389744000,7,198,4.852941176470588
5994391,5,B00FK9KTRU,"This movie was inspired by a true story. The story is about the life of Miles Montego.

Miles Montego is being watched by the police. He has an expensive car, lives in a mansion, and doesn't appear to have employment that would bring in that kind of money. This is a movie that is quite emotional, spiritual, and shows the value of family and friends. It illustrates the power of prayer during a time when a miracle needed to occur. It is a story of redemption, forgiveness, love , understanding, and a man's journey to find God and a faith based life. It is a story about letting go so God can make things happen in your life.

Vanessa was the catalyst for Miles to have his life changing experiences and opportunities. Miles makes an amazing transformation in his life. Vanessa and Miles were tested along the way in their relationship but their love and commitment to each other and God kept them together.

I believer that you will enjoy this movie and the message about life.

This movie is awesome and really shows what happens when your faith is strong and steady.  Not one word of profanity and no sexual scenes.

My wife is concerned that it is not realistic and encourages christian girls to date non-christians guys or youngsters with obvious issues in the hope of turning them around. This may be so, and would be an unfortunate conclusion.

Thank God! I didn't think it was possible for a rapper to do this.  Amazingly this movie had a good storyline and kept my interest the entire time.

5994436,5,B00FK9KTRU,"I love this movie, the entire movie was about hope in the Lord. Now it could be criticize about his girl being in a club, or even the way she was dressed, but the movie was aiming for the unlearned, and so they took a few liberties. As far Ja Rule not going to jail to pay for his crimes against society. God is the final judge...PERIOD. In my own life I faced similar circumstances, and went to the court house to turn myself in. When I told the clerk who I was, she looked it up and looked at me where I could tell she found the warrants. She told me that I should come back at 1:30pm. I went home and told my wife all that occurred. We prayed and I went back and spoke to another clerk that informed me that my record was clean. I knew God did that. I could tell of other miracles He did on my behalf, but I'll just tell you this, "" You got to have a relationship with Jesus Christ for your self,"" and watch Him do it for you. The you'll have your own testimony. Hallelujah!!!!!!!!",1458691200,2,984,4.0

5994440,4,B00FK9KTRU,"I'm in Love with a Church Girl (Steve Race, USA, 2013). Ja Rule stars in the latest christian movie we soiled our souls with. I don't want to ruin this one for anyone, as I assume most of you are Ja Rule fans, but with the authorities (Stephen Baldwin and Michael Madsen) on his tail, he turns his life around once he catches the glimpse of a hot young thang and finds out she is a christian attending a local church. She is slightly disappointed that he used to murder people and peddle drugs, but loves even more that he has a huge house and loads of money. Will he ever be able to be forgiven for his past? Yes! Immediately and without any real effort! Will the cast have to continue to compliment Ja Rule in every line of dialogue no matter if it's coming from his friends or supposed enemies? Yes! Will they talk about how he has a really large penis? Yes! I guess they will.",1456444800,,880,4.21301775147929
5994441,5,B00FK9KTRU,"I truly loved this movies.  I have watched it over and over again.  There were parts in the movie that was not pertaining to holiness, but the jist of the movie was dynamic to know that God is able to changed anybody and he can use extreme circumstances to get ones attention.  I would not suggest that every saved woman go the extent that Vanessa went to in the movie, because that may not be the way God want things to turn out for you, but if we get in God's perfect will, and let him lead our lives, things will work out in God's favor and in your favor.  I suggest this movies to be watched by all young men and women that is not saved.

5994444,1,B00FK9KTRU,"I will say the best & most Christian actors & actresses in this movie was both sets of the parents & Vanessa's 2 sisters. They really almost had Vanessa dressed like a hooker & a very worldly woman herself. In real life: A woman who dresses & acts like she did would NOT influence ANY man to become a Christian. There were some moments when the acting from both Vanessa & her future husband was more genuine & sincere. Yet, those moments are too few & far in - between. While I believe a lot of time, effort, & money was spent on making this movie: There's simply too much worldliness & ungodly innuendos & suggestive behavior & dialogs. Probably the hardest thing for me to accept about this movie is that I bought A LOT of them as Christmas gifts for part of my family & friends. I mistakenly thought this was going to be a GOOD Christian movie (after seeing the previews), & the price was so very reasonable. My hard - learned lesson is: This movie does NOT represent & show Christians & Christianity in the right way at all. Whether the movie is based - on a true story or not: It reeks of too much sinful life styles. I pray that my family & friends are not horrified by this so - called ""Christian movie!"" = (",1454371200,,1215,4.241379310344827

5994521,1,B00FK9KTRU,"I rarely rate things below 3 and of my more than 400+ reviews only given two other 1 ratings. This absolutely deserves one star. Some really terrific Christian movies are now being made this isn't one of them!

I couldn't force myself to finish this story beyond the 50+ minutes because I got so angry at the lies sewn by this film. My Lord did not die on the Cross to offer his grace and mercy for so I could flaunt it or offer cheap grace to others!

A lying drug dealer supposedly changes for a Christian girl. This story starts to smell shortly after starting. The ""Christian"" girl is very hip and doesn't seem to be impacted much by her Christian faith in the least. Her attire for one thing doesn't exactly portray a ""ladylike"" demeanor and in a nutshell, this story is all about appearance. She meets this wealthy, well-spoken drug dealer at a party of a mutual Christian acquaintance.

Her extremely wealthy drug dealing boyfriend is not just a high ranking drug kingpin with a mansion (which no one seems to question his great success at his young age). Nope, in fact, they all believe that he is rich from his investments in the stock market and other ethical businesses he owns. He finally realizes he is in hot water when he and the young lady are at a bar with his friends who start talking about him being a gang banger. Later at a diner he confesses that he used to be involved in drug dealing and that these friends were part of his crew. What he leaves out is that he is still involved.

The young lady congratulates his honesty and tells him she loves him but she never asks him if he repented. She assumes he hasn't telling him that she can't hang out with him if he isn't a Christian. Here was a perfect opportunity to share Christ's love and mercy and she is telling him she loves him for his integrity but he needs to become a Christian to continue seeing her. That is manipulation. Jesus doesn't manipulate. Oh, and it was no biggie for him to walk away from the gangster and drug world without anyone getting upset. Um hum.

Yes, everything is easy peasy when we date non-Christians. If this young lady was so concerned about dating a non-Christian why did she stay out until the early morning hours with him the day they met then call him at 6:00am so she could 'beat him to calling winning the game'? Of course, there is one bad person in the movie, the young girl's mom, who when introduced to the young man refuses to shake his hand (we assume it is because he is black), after all, he is dressed nice (though covered with tattoos) and is very gracious and respectful, so the only one who's alarms go off is a bigoted Christian, nice stereotyping by the creators. I only wish that I had read the negative reviews before wasting 50 minutes of my time on this garbage.

Yes, Jesus died for all sinners. We are to come out of the world and be the light. We don't go dating people then manipulate them into becoming a Christian just so we can date them or get a notch in converted a lost soul column. Being a Christian is about changing from our old lifestyle to understanding that only through Christ can we find true happiness and eternal salvation. It isn't about getting to date the pretty, church attending girl. I will pray for the veil to be lifted from the creators and actors in this film. I am pretty sure ""God, Executive Producer"" isn't the one that created the world. Be not deceived little children...

The truth of Christ's sacrifice shouldn't be cheapened as it is in this movie. Yes, we are all sinners, and yes, we all can be forgiven of anything except blaspheming of the Holy Spirit but this movie isn't a good representation of the gospel message.",1414627200,4,3691,4.427098674521355
5994522,3,B00FK9KTRU,"As a Christian I have mixed feelings about this movie that I rented as an instant video. I love that the film industry is using their talent to bring people to the Lord. A changed life is what prompted this movie. That the life of a worldly, materially successful former drug dealer could be transformed through interaction with a Christian woman and his subsequent introduction to Christ is the premise here. In real life it could so easily go the other way. I was intrigued by the fact this had some basis in truth. I did question the Christian woman's obvious showing of cleavage, but not her pull toward the main character. It can happen, and their relationship was based on mutual attraction with them meeting at his friend's house, not in a club or place that would be questionable for a committed Christian to frequent. Sadly, that happened later. What I did find believable and relevant was how - when it was obvious how committed she was and when it became apparent what his past and present really was - that it caused conflict in their relationship. I found Mr. Atkins' portrayal of a man in one lifestyle being drawn to another very believable. He did a great job showing the journey of a man firmly in the world being transformed through the power of God's Word and exposure to those living committed Christian lives. As a parent I related to the Christian mother's concerns, but was disappointed in how the father reacted. In the end this is a story of redemption, based on a true story - but with obvious variations as I found out by researching the actual story after viewing). I found the acting a little less professional than I would have liked (other than that by Mr. Atkins and the actress portraying the church girl). It did seem that it improved, as each character was further developed in the movie. I would recommend this to seasoned Christians, rather than fledgling ones. There are some mixed messages for anyone seeking to change their life and viewpoint. I would hesitate to present this to Christian teens, but can see how non-Christians might relate to the way faith is presented here. I wish I could give it more than a three-star rating. because I applaud this medium of reaching others for Christ. I honestly cannot.",1414368000,,2250,4.670025188916877

I enjoyed the movie very much. It had a twist at the end that made me cry. I love hearing and learning of how others began their journey to a life of Christ. While this Christian life-style is a growth process and we all are at different levels in Christ...I must admit,  the young lady seem to have some growing to do; as we all do.  I found that she was in places that I wouldn't have gone...and dating a guy that was not ""Saved"" or ""a Christian""...that's an absolute No-No!!!!

The lead girl (""church girl"") had many red flags that should have led her to drop him as a boy friend. He said to her parents that he didn't
know if he wanted to follow God and that he didn't want to go to church.  He told her that he didn't want to talk about what the Bible meant.
The Bible is clear about not dating a non Christian.  The girl continued to chase after him, in spite of all this and more.
Her parents agreed to him marrying her before they knew he was a Christian.
Later he accepted Jesus as his Lord and savior, but he and the girl should have waited 1-2 years to see if he was a genuine Christian,
before considering marriage.  Finally, he never apologized to the people he'd hurt in the past, or paid back any money he'd taken
illegally.  He was deeply involved in selling drugs and the leader of other drug criminals.

After hearing about this movie on K-LOVE radio, I hoped that the contrast between the drug dealer and the church girl would balance religion with reality, and create a bit either action or comedy in how these characters interact, rather than this being a bible-thumping movie where every third line is either a reference to scripture or shaming the guy for his reluctance to attend church.  ...but the movie turned out to be more about guns than drugs, and yes, every third line was either a reference to scripture or shaming the protagonist for not attending church.

5994583,5,B00FK9KTRU,"This film shows that the process of change take time. All that ultimately does matter is that a person align his or herself with God. All the cars, money and jewelry mean nothing without God guiding you. Adherence to God is necessary to make it to heaven. It doesn't matter what your testimony is, if you do not accept God and follow him, you aren't walking the right path. This film does a great job of even showing that devout Christians mustn't judge but seek to help the lost be found. How can we sit there and forget that we're all brothers and sisters under God? That's been lost in today's climate of Christianity and it's sad. Glad this film emphasizes extending a helping hand regardless of the circumstance.",1402704000,2,717,4.565891472868217

5994585,2,B00FK9KTRU,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie because I think it's an interesting topic. But, it's so NOT how things are in real life!! Please take this from a 20 year old Christian woman who was in love with a guy for 5 years who was a thug...it doesn't happen like this. I feel like the Christian girl should've been more ""Christian"". I never would've got an attitude with my boyfriends ex because I'm secure in God. I also would be more careful about the way I dress, especially around my boyfriend (since we're not having sex) and especially if he's weak in that area or has had sex before. I also didn't like how they showed the pastor (although I like that they showed you don't need to wear a suit to be a pastor, all the showcasing of wealth was completely unnecessary). I think the acting was pretty good but Vanessa doesn't really represent myself or my other Christian friends. Of course we've all dated guys we shouldn't have but we wouldn't go to a club or the other half of the things Vanessa does. I also feel the movie needed to be more realistic. I know Christian guys who've tried to do more with their girlfriends (including my own) and I have to check him sometimes! And he's saving himself for marriage just as I am and grew up traditional. I was hoping for more realism in this movie. I don't really care to watch this movie ever again but it's ok, I think it'll still bless someone, just not me. I was really hoping to FINALLY see a Christian woman like myself or my other friends but I didn't.",1402617600,3,1521,4.340350877192982

5994589,2,B00FK9KTRU,"I am a youth leader. Because of this, I have concerns about this movie. My conversations with kids are directed toward choices that are protective in nature. For example, the Bible tells us to ""Guard our hearts, for out of it flows the issues of life."" My concern is that the girl in this movie chose not to guard her heart, was materialistic, demonstrated poor choices (clubs, drinks, dating a non-Christian). But, there is even more to be concerned about here. The attitudes that are promoted in this movie really break my heart because they look so much like the world. We truly have enough movies out there promoting dating whoever, wearing whatever, doing whatever and hoping that God takes care of all of the consequences. We don't need ""faith based"" movies to lie to kids and that's what this did. It says that a girl could date a drug dealer, be in life threatening situations and be in motel rooms with this guy and then...after all of those bad choices think that there will be no consequence. That's just the type of thing that I encourage my kids to stay away from. Choices like that have consequences and that is not promoted in this movie.",1400889600,9,1153,4.601941747572815

5994597,1,B00FK9KTRU,"Long awaited the release of this movie, because it featured (20 seconds) of Toby Mac.  Not worth it.  Disturbed by the many moments in which this movie showed faith as very relative and self-defined.  For example, the characters do not call themselves Christians, but prefer ""people of faith.""  If this movie IS about the redemptive benefit of Christianity and Christ, then why be ashamed of His name and that title?  A preacher defends his driving of a Lamborghini, when the main character questions how a man in service to God can justify such extravagance.  A ""nice"" car would have been sufficient to show that a person ""of faith"" does not HAVE to embrace poverty.  But one living on the salary of a church driving a car that is more expensive than three family cars?  Is there no one living in poverty in this sunny city, that a pastor is justified at driving such an outrageously expensive car, rather than the church supporting the poor and other ministries?  Two examples, but the movie has more.  I do not recommend this, unless you're willing to fast forward through most of it.

First of all as Christians the Bible is very clear about not being unequally yoked. Yet this character in the movie apparently sees nothing wrong with it. She goes to night clubs with this man and wears low revealing tops. No modesty at all in this movie. Staying with a man who is not your husband in the same hotel room is not ok, playing with fire. This man is supposed to be rich yet they share a hotel room together. Separate beds yes, but its just temptation in front of you. The Ja Rule character used to be a drug dealer and from that has made money, he does not do it anymore but has money still from doing that.

5994648,2,B00FK9KTRU,"""Babe, wait. Are you saying the bible says it's ok to have sex?""  Really?  Really?  I don't need some book to tell me if what is natural is ""ok"" for me to do or not. No offense, I consider myself a liberal christian.  This movie is like a montage of several short clips smooshed together.  There is no explanation of why Vanessa and Miles even fall in love, no romance,  All of a sudden they are just spending all their time together--It's like Vanessa is just waiting for Miles to conclude that her beliefs (Christianity, no sex till after marriage, etc.) are the right and only way to live. And after he does, what, she lets him in her pants?  When they are talking about how Miles has been reading the bible and what he thinks about it, he says he is still confused and she says, ""When you're ready, when you're ready"".  while draping her legs in between his while sitting together.  She goes to clubs which in itself may not be wrong, but she is definitely not giving Miles the impression that she is different than other girls.  No wonder the man is so confused lol. They say they love each other but we don't see any relationship development.  Just didn't make much sense.  It really was like something you'd see in a church youth group.  HIghly predictable, you should know it ends in a church scene with Miles converting.",1393027200,3,1329,4.4421487603305785

It doesn't matter to me that its not an ""accurate"" depiction about real life dealers and gangsters. Its a movie for christ sake. It doesn't have to be real. Its a movie with a good message. He who findeth a wife, findeth a good thing. She obviously was his good thing. She may of wore dresses above her knees, but newsflash many people do. The times have changed and God does say come as you are. Long as she wasn't naked, it shouldn't matter what she wore, as long as she went to church and believed. She got the man to come to church, when his own mother couldn't. She never gave up her goodies til marriage. She forgave and showed him how to do the same. She made him want to be a better person. The movie may of had predictable and unbelievable moments, but i still think the message was good.  Bt the way the bible also talks about judgement, so while everyone is on here being very critical and analytical about a movie, remember god is judging you too. Don't like, then ok. Let it be known and move on. No need to go back and forth bickering because you will never win an debate about religion and one's on beliefs. Lighten up",1393027200,2,1242,4.196652719665272

5994665,1,B00FK9KTRU,"My wife and I are Christians and were looking forward to a good, clean, realistic, well acted movie.  This movie failed in so many ways. A pastor driving a Lamborghini...really?  A girlfriend who finds herself in a motel room with him weeks into the relationship and is confidently telling him he's on the couch while she goes into the bedroom...I wish I could believe it would happen that way (especially when you consider how she dresses in the movie).  Reading the Song of Solomon and then taking a cold shower afterwards...really?  Parents that are mindless and clueless about their child's lifestyle and circumstances.  And her dad was a piece of work...no way does she have that kind of conviction and strength throughout the movie as a result of spending her childhood under the care and Christian training of a dad who acts like a moron.  From beginning to end, she wears clothes that reflect an attitude about her body that didn't mesh with the choices she makes in the movie.  This inconsistency is one of many that plagued this movie.  Friends that are loyal to a fault...in other words, not realistic.  The scene at the end of the movie where it shows his friends in jail reading letters about his changed life, and they're seemingly thrilled with this...I do jail ministry and believe me, it doesn't go down like that.  A  scene where the main character drives erratically and it's not clear at all why.  A flight in a private jet toward the end of the movie that was one more flaunt of this man's material world that he had acquired through drug money.  Enough already, glorifying the riches this man possesses.  And what's with his legitimate business?  We never get to see just how talented he is that results in money that maintains this extravagant lifestyle...something about Funk shows...whatever.  The scenes of the DEA agents were like SNL skits.  My wife and I looked at each other and laughed whenever the movie featured one of their stakeouts.  I'm not saying that God can't have unrealistic events take place in the lives of believers...He is God.  However, those who made this movie had me feeling so gullible by the end that I really was left feeling disappointed that they couldn't make a movie that developed the plot better and projected characters and situations that were more believable.  I thank God for movies like Courageous and Fireproof...Hollywood can do it...but certainly not this time.",1392422400,12,2428,4.832929782082324

Although it is a faith based story, there is no attempt to convert you to any religion. It is the story of the redemption of one of California's most wanted kingpins through the love, care and faith of a church girl. A key line is when she invited him to go with her to church with her, he replied ""I don't think God would want people like me there""",1391558400,,520,4.009615384615385

5994679,1,B00FK9KTRU,"If you go to IMBD, this movie has 3.8 star, yet to date, this movie has 26 reviews and 4.5 stars. This equals fake reviews.

Ok, now about the movie.

For Christians, this movie is a complete wolf in sheep's clothing. I met my wife at church, we were both single for 2 years, we dated for 1 year and stayed pure until our wedding night. No Christian women I know would one, dress like this ""church"" girl, two would date a non-christian in the manner in which this one did throughout the entire move. I.e. go to clubs and have a good time without being convicted. No real Christian woman who is sold out for Christ would behave in this way. Perhaps a friendship would slowly begin, but they would be extremely guarded until that person got saved, and the pastor would protect and guard that daughter of God, not encourage it. This movie gives a false picture and example on how a Christian woman should act! Disgraceful!

As far as Ja Rules part, this is not real life. In the real world, actions have consequences. You can't just live however you want, ""turn"" your life around, keep all your drug money, and not pay the price for your life! That is not how things work, in the real world, you pay the price for your crimes, lose everything you have and go to jail when you are a big time drug dealer. You don't slip away with all your money, possessions and get the girl!

Here is the moral of the movie, go out, live how you want to live, run a crew, sell drugs, buy a Bentley, huge house and jewelry. then, go find yourself a beautiful girl who goes to church. Then one day you feel bad, change your evil ways, marry the church girl and keep all your drug money and Bentley and become a pastor. After all, life has no consequences, money is great, and hot church girls are cool, right? So hey, go do what you want, it will all work out in the end as long as you feel bad about it.

Wow, this movie is a lie, this is not life. Jesus died and paid the price for your sins, he suffered and died for you. If you believe this movie, you would think that when you become a Christian everything is going to be amazing and easy. Jesus does not promise an easy life, many times your life becomes significantly more difficult for many reason when you become a Christian. Jesus will give you peace through the storm, but does not promise and easy life.",1391212800,84,2343,4.2561797752808985

5994681,5,B00FK9KTRU,This story is full of inspiration! It is perfect for tween and teens to teach them about redemption.

Just one thing to remember about the leading man.....not all bad boys come clean....yes, God can and does change even the hardest hearts, but this young man had parents who prayed for him continually and who had taken him to church as a boy.  This was more of a ""coming home"" story than a 180 degree turn!  Girls, don't go lookin' for a bad boy to save.

5994687,4,B00FK9KTRU,"Ok, so I know everyone won't agree with me, but I stand for the Lord on this one-

 Message was fantastic, but here's where they go wrong as a couple: God can save anyone but... As a ""Christian"" women you don't date a man of the world, and then try to convert him. That's up to God. She should've waited a bit longer to see his stance and if he wants to pursue God.

Ok. You're saved and you go to clubs?! No, I can't understand that one. Also, what church has provocatively dressed women like that attending? How are men suppose to focus on the message. Women are to be beautiful and feminine, I get that, but this is wardrobe for the bedroom only.

For me it's not a complete 5, because I just can't get past the idea of Christians thinking it's ok to represent yourself to the world and do the ""dating"" scene backwards. No, women please wait for the man to surrender himself to God first or you will have huge fights in your marriage. Alot of ""Christian"" women think they can change a man, but it very so often works that way.

2 Cor. 6:14 The bible says to not be yoked with unbelievers (in the first place)
1 Tim- Women dress modestly (wow, not quite with this movie)

I think it presents God in a fashion where he is an accepting all -powerful God, and rightly so, but please be careful to understand that Christian/Disciple women are suppose to present themselves in a way where they can be an example by their demeanor and by the way they are dressed. She had a smile on her face when he went to chug down some liquor- why?

 Fix your eyes on Yeshu'a (Jesus), the author and perfecter of our faith (Heb. 12).

Men -You have to be very careful to look away at many of the women.

This review is biblically based 1 Tim talks about the bible being used for rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness. So, maybe this review will help some of you will train your eyes to see through all of the immodest dressing. It doesn't make you weak, it's just wise to keep your focus.

The film reminded me of Back in the Day with Ja and Ving Rhames. This is a faith based film that is not boring or preachy.

8616271,2,B00FK9KTRU,"Found some parts questionable as a family Christian movie. Our family loves to watch Christian movies on Sunday nights as a family.  AS a mother of three daughters I talk to my daughters often about missionary dating (dating a non believer with hopes that you might convert them) and that it is not a good idea to entertain dating a non believer because they may not truly convert. As a married woman, I can't imagine the difficulty of being unequally yoked and raising children if my husband and I did not both love the Lord and share those values. I don't want hollywood to make it seem like it always works out and it's okay to date non believers because you are doing God's work. Guard your heart! This is dramatized and it doesn't always work out as such!

I also did not care for the ""slumber"" parties the main characters had even though they slept in separate rooms. This is dangerous for younger single Christian ladies to see and to think it's okay to put themselves in that position. Everyone wants to believe they will be strong and not fall victim to sexual sin, but the best and safest practice is not to put yourself in these situations.

I did think Ja Rule acted well in this movie and I always love to see a drama where someone comes to the Lord.

The clothing was not appropriate for a Christian movie to watch with my daughters, I did not care for some of the details even if people felt it depicted ""real"" life, it's not the life I want for my girls. I do not them hanging at bars, dressing in tight clothing, having sleep overs with males even if nothing occurs and do not want them dating non believers.
