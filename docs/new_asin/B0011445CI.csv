8240260,5,B0011445CI,"This 1979 Bulldog Drummond farce works best as a live play! Much of the humor comes from the great spontaneous, perfectly timed performances.  You are amazed at the accuracy of the actors! This was a live performance on stage before an audience.  And the live reaction of the audience adds to the enjoyment of the play.

This performance by London's Low Moan Spectacular Comedy Troupe (the original London/New York cast) was videotaped live in Los Angeles during their 1979 tour.  Watch the talented Mark Blankfield as he performs multiple roles, one even in the same scene requiring him to do quick 3-second costume changes behind a back-drop as he fights himself!  This just would not have the same impact in a film production.
Alan Shearman seems to be born to play Bullshot Crummond.  Along with the others, Alan co-wrote the script.
Diz White seems to channel Carol Burnette in her performance as the ditzy leading lady Rosmary Fenton.  You will think you are watching a younger Carol, Diz is just perfect for the role, she co-wrote the script and created the idea.
Ron House plays villain Otto Von Brunno/Scalicio, he co-wrote the script and also worked with Diz on the creation of the idea.
Brandis Kemp is the villainess Lenya Von Brunno

Other writers to the script were John Neville-Andrews and Derek Cunningham.

A movie version just can not capture this energy!  You know that the cameras stopped to set up the next scene, here it just moves right along for almost 90 minutes with just one intermission break.

Fortunately my 1984 RKO Home Video Tape is still in good shape. It appears this may never get re-released on DVD!  RKO Home Video is out of business, and the producer, Nedlander Brothers, doesn't seem to be around either.
The DVD from Image Entertainment is not this same production, it is the 1984 filmed movie version.  This is the way Bullshot was intended to be seen, a live stage performance.

If you are lucky enough to find a used copy of the VHS tape, you will be amazed at the non-stop humor and performances of the stars.

It is sad that there are only two reviews for this classic stage play.  This is probably because it was released well before Amazon.com came into existence and it is now forgotten.",1363564800,5,2236,4.724226804123711
8240261,5,B0011445CI,"For those who first saw this on early HBO in the 80s, there is no substitute. The subsequent film _Bullshot!_ lost some of the situational chemistry between players in the live stage version, where the improbabilities of the physical performances made 99% of the fun. I would certainly recommend this production made viewable for beginning drama majors, to show versatility, but also how hamming looks when done deliberately and correctly for comedic effect. A gem, a joy.",1334793600,4,472,5.142857142857143
