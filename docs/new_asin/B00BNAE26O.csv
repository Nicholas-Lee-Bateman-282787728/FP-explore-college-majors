5657400,4,B00BNAE26O,"This is a great series that kept the whole family entertained, I only wish that the discs were longer and contained more shows. But this is still a great show and one of my 9 and 6 year old sons favorites.",1377043200,4,205,4.024390243902439
5657401,5,B00BNAE26O,"Ever since we first heard of Slugterra my whole family has been hooked.  Yes I admit I watch it with them.  First I want to say this is not like the Japanese-animation shows, which I don't usually like. The show is colorful, fun and the only weapons really used is their Slug Blaster which shoots slugs.  My boys (5 and 6) think it is so silly to see the slugs flying through the air and are excited to see which power will be unleashed.  This DVD contains five episodes with almost two hours of Slugterra fun and while these are episodes that have been on television before, my boys didn't mind watching them again.  It is nice to have the DVD to watch them anytime.  I recommend this for any child looking for a new show to watch!  If your worried too if they'll like it, check your local listings on television for when Slugterra is on!

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1374019200,7,913,4.329411764705882
5657402,5,B00BNAE26O,"Short and sweet. My 6 year old son LOVES this. It is pretty much a rip-off from another popular kids show, but my son could care less- and it's done very well. The slugs are pretty funny, he loves them. He actually wants to catch real slugs to make characters out of them- I am really hoping that does not happen. He has watched this over and over and over again- it's cute, harmless, and funny. Your child will be happy I can assure you!",1373241600,4,438,4.1647058823529415
