7838098,5,6303113400,"I'm puzzled. One reviewer refers to a Hardy Classics version; another to the Bel Canto Society version. So there are 2 versions of this, one supposedly better than the other in terms of subtitles. If I order this, which version am I getting?!?",1409788800,,243,4.674418604651163
7838099,5,6303113400,"Tajo makes you feel how fast Pasquale's heart is beating when he meets ""Sofronia."" His tones are soft in texture, warm and happy as he fantasizes about her (""Un foco insolito""). Notice how he blends his voice with the violins. His sound becomes resolute and a little gruff when he confronts Ernesto (""Prendo moglie""). When Norina slaps Pasquale, Tajo becomes affecting--but not to the point that the comedy is lost. From the slap onward, he is more whipped than angry. In bearing and facial expression, his Pasquale is suggestive of Walter Matthau. Tajo does mug.

Much of Pasquale's music is patter singing or chatter. Thus the role traditionally has been played as a buffo caricato (exaggerated buffo), in the manner of Fernando Corena. Tajo plays it as a buffo nobile (noble buffo), accentuating the pathos over the comedy. The bottom line is his charisma does carry the performance.

As Ernesto, Valletti is heavily under the influence of his teacher Tito Schipa, who recorded the part. In certain passages, such as ""Caro, caro,"" in ""Sogno soave e casto,"" Valletti's inflections sound Schipa-derived. He has the same wistful melancholy but not the charisma. His ""Cercher lontana terra"" is understated, like Schipa's, and he uses dynamics and tone color to contrast different sections of the aria. His top whitens in the manner of all Schipa pupils. (I myself stopped studying with Schipa in part to avoid this.) Del Monaco, Corelli and nearly all other tenors of the era invariably cover and darken their voices from the passaggio on up. Valletti in general does not. (When he does darken, it's usually in the middle.) His capacious breath span enables him to join together some already lengthy phrases in ""Com' gentil."" He finds meaning in words others merely vocalize. His legato is beautiful--and is not at the expense of diction; his and Tajo's is crystalline.

Since shortly after 1900 until recently, most singers have used mask placement (which is now being edged aside by mechanistic approaches). Noni's is an extreme example, with the voice far forward in the face. Her top is a little wiry. She inflects words cannily. Hers is a mature Norina, yet she is expert at playing the innocent, making her transformation into the vixen the more telling.

Malatesta's part has plenty of 16th notes, and Bruscantini articulates them without sounding choppy. His downbeats are expressive, with appoggiaturas accentuated, resolutions tapered so as to emphasize harmonic tension and deemphasize harmonic relaxation. (This is the opposite of ""last syllableitis,"" the prolongation or accentuation of the last syllable.) He and Tajo both have good trills and sing their patter with brio.

The ensembles include some repeats ordinarily cut in traditional performances. The production is straightforward. The camera captures facial detail that would be lost in the theater.

The Bel Canto Society version of this Pasquale has PCM audio, unlike the one on Hardy Classic, which has Dolby Digital audio at 192 K, which discards eighty-seven-and-one-half percent of the sound.--Stefan Zucker",1336348800,,3083,5.205645161290323
7838100,5,6303113400,"I almost agree with the above three reviewers.
It is definitely a 1955 film in black and white, but a joy nonetheless.
Tajo, as Don Pasquale, immediately made me think of Rolando Villazon with his expressions and acting.
I already have a good version with Furlanetto, Focile and Kunde, and have watched the Metopera HD performance with Netrebko, del Carlo and Polenzani on a large screen. All are quite different and this older film, even though it is abridged, challenges them both. A little disappointed in Alda Noni, but impressed by Valetti and Bruscatini.
I am very pleased to have it as a comparison, and a reminder of what we have missed, as performances by the earlier stars are seldom available on DVD.",1332115200,,711,4.788617886178862
7838101,5,6303113400,"Wow, I got this because I fell in love with Sesto Bruscantini's voice, I got La Serva Padrona and started searching for more of this talented singers work.  Then to find that all the singers on this Don Pasquale dvd are delightful and musically gorgeous to boot... this opera is done so well with such humorous touches, I can watch it again and again.  If you like this type of humorous interplay between operatic characters I can also recommend l'Elisir d'Amore with Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon - Dulcamara and Belcore are so hilarious with their comedic touches that I never tire of watching them.  I usually gravitate more toward the comedies and buffo operas, this Don Pasquale is really a gem.",1292976000,2,705,4.762295081967213
7838102,5,6303113400,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I come new to this opera, but not new to opera in general. Yes, it looks like black and white 1955 television, but this is forgotten in a moment as the theatrical fun begins. Delightful!",1282348800,4,222,4.439024390243903
7838103,5,6303113400,"This Don Pasquale is a 1955 black and white film from Italian television produced by Hardy Classics.  Unlike the Bel Canto Society version of the same production, this one has good, visible subtitles in English, French, Italian and Spanish.

I love this opera and I have all the current versions.  I think that this one must be the model that all others aspire to match.  And, in my opinion, no one comes even close to Italo Tajo as Don Pasquale and Sesto Bruscantini as Dottor Malatesta!  They are simply hilarious.  Their facial expressions and comic timing are just nonstop funny.  Of course, their singing is top shelf also.  Alda Noni as Norina is in the same unbeatable category with a soprano to match.  Cesare Valletti is a very funny Ernesto with a luscious tenor voice.  The chorus numbers were also wonderful, very animated and inventive.  No stand and sing in this production!

Donizetti's score is so lively and beautiful and the orchestra conducted by Alberto Erede did it justice.  You knew the whole thing would be wonderful while listening to the overture.

If you like Don Pasquale, don't miss this one.  My face was fixed in a grin for the whole thing!",1207267200,14,1171,4.727722772277228
7838104,3,6303113400,"I should have read the one previous review before I ordered this.  I also did not notice that the running time is only 60 minutes.  As the lady who wrote the initial review said, it is just an interview of Barbara Hendricks discussing her performance.  I have yet to view it, so I can't yet comment on the quality of the performances of her and her co-performers.",1165622400,,363,4.388059701492537
7838105,3,6303113400,"Because it has no subtitles, I recommend this production only if you are familiar with Don Pasquale. It's a black and white made-for-Italian-TV film from 1955. The performances are excellent, but the sound isn't always in synch with the picture. If you already love Don Pasquale, this is definitely worth owning for its great buffo acting and its fine singing.",1147996800,8,360,5.016666666666667
7838106,3,6303113400,"The introduction of this video is:""My favorite opera"", which clarify itself that it would not be a complete performance. And true, this video is a combination of biography of how she became an opera singer, told by the singer itself, Barbara Hendricks and a description of the personification of Norina, the main female role in the story which was told lengthily followed by several extracts of the music or arias in the rehearsals as well as of the performance itself. Albeit Don Pasquale is not the most popular opera of Donizetti,however watching and listening to this video, it is rather a disappointment for real opera lovers only to be able to watch and listen to only parts of the divine and melodious music which is also sung excellently and brilliantly by Barbara Hendricks and al. We would then wonder when a complete performance of this opera will be available in video, as we are convinced that Barbara Hendricks made this performance so witty, brilliant and maervellous.",990403200,8,983,4.927710843373494
