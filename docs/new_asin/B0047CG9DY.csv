8417974,5,B0047CG9DY,The movie is a wonderful example of the acting of lead VIncent Cassel as well as a secondary role of Roy DuPuis. You know a movie is great when about 5 minutes in you don't even realize that you are reading subtitles. Wow!,1377820800,,222,4.186046511627907
8417975,5,B0047CG9DY,"Roy Dupuis delivers again in a thought provoking movie.  So, for any of you Roy Dupuis lovers out there, do not hesitate to purchase this one.  His movies always leave you wanting more.  How I wish he would do another Canadian series like the Last Chapter for his American fans.",1357516800,,278,4.52
8417976,5,B0047CG9DY,"I enjoy film that have some historical events. Mesrine lived a life full of love and crime, you love him one minute, hate him the next, and finally admiration for a tortured soul.",1322179200,,179,4.454545454545454
