8085149,4,B000BCINLK,"While it took a long time to arrive, it was worth the wait. This DVD is titled ""Nancy Sinatra"", but it could just as well have been named, ""Movie' With Nancy"", an NBC TV Special. The video is VHS-quality, but not washed out or grainy.

I especially liked the commercials for RC Cola within the video. It is definitely indicative of the late 60's.",1492905600,,346,4.40625
