""The Rabbit of Seville"" makes twisted use of the classical music, with Tony-worthy staging.  ""What's Opera, Doc?"" is short but brilliant.  Of course, we know it as ""Kill the Wabbit.""  When I first showed this to my daughter when she was 5 - and enthusiastically sang along - she thought mommy had lost her mind (not for the first time).",1530921600,,497,4.3478260869565215
