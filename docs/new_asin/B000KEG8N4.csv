8155781,4,B000KEG8N4,"This dvd shows the highlights of an exciting and emotional Ryder Cup.  Each Ryder Cup stands alone as it exemplifies the high emotion of team match play.  The newest Spanish Armada - Olazabal and Garcia, the valiant play of Darren Clarke and the shared emotion from both America's team and the European team are featured.  Behind-the-scenes adds to the enjoyment of this dvd.",1173312000,,375,4.920634920634921
8155782,5,B000KEG8N4,"As an Irishman living in the US, I cannot begin to decribe how emotional the 3 days of the 2006 Ryder Cup proved to be. With Darren Clarke wearing his emotions for all to see, with the Irish crowd carrying the European team along on a wave of euphoria and with the USA team unable to find an answer to what was happening all around them, this was surely the greatest Ryder Cup of them all. Hole-in-ones, chip-ins, high level sportsmanship and Guinness to celebrate on the balcony. This DVD of the events that unfolded at the K Club in County Kildare will take you there and back with a smile on your face and a tear in your eye. It was so good to see Paul Casey come out on top of the USA team member who took pleasure in belittling him after some misinterpreted comments a couple of years ago. I doubt any of the fans at the K Club even realised Ver-Plank was on the course! Bring on 2008!",1169078400,,890,4.180232558139535
