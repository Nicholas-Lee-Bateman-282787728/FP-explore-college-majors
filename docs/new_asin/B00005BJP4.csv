7937755,2,B00005BJP4,"I bought this thinking it was going to have behind the scenes cuts or such.  The whole thing is just not about Lucy.  And is not fun to watch either. Most of the videos have long programs where Lucy, Desi, Vivian & Bill appear very slightly, the only one I remember they appear for the longest time is the Ed Sullivan show.  The part where Lucy is awarded is nice to watch once or twice but not all the time.  I mean I was expecting to see the part where she was in the program ""what's my line"".  I expected cuts of all her TV appearances.  There's no description for it here at Amazon so you don't have a clue of what you're getting.  Although I bought it in a store and the description on the box is not good either.  It doesn't tell you, you have to watch for hours and you're only going to see Lucy & Desi for only about 1/2 hour throughout the videos.",1036108800,6,856,4.053571428571429
