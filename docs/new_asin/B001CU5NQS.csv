8289311,4,B001CU5NQS,"Rishabh (Salman Khan) and Pari (Preity Zinta) have a deeply happy, loving marriage until Pari is killed in an accident.  At her death, she becomes connected to a young woman (Dhani, played by Bhumika Chawla) in a real and tangible way.  Unaware of the connection between them, Rishabh and Dhani meet.  Dhani immediately falls in love with him, and Rishabh, though attracted, fights against it, as he'd rather live in the past with Pari.  When the connection is discovered, their lives will be changed.

This is a sweet, emotional drama, celebrating the depth of true love.  Khan has good chemistry with both Zinta and Chawla, and all play their parts well.  Helen plays Dhani's grandmother and is, as always, a delight.  The music is nice, but the choreography is below average.  Overall, despite a resolution I found to be too quick, this is an excellent film.",1505865600,,861,4.842465753424658

8289313,5,B001CU5NQS,I am a Salman Khan fan. He did a superb acting job. I have seen the American film with similar storyline and it did not detract from movie at all. Excellent addition to my Bollywood collection.,1374710400,,193,4.388888888888889
