7894019,4,6305611971,"6 teenagers get the idea to rob a bank. None are very bright. All are stock characters. The tough leader, his crazy relative (you know he will start trouble), the leaders girlfriend, the doofy kid, the fat alienated kid and the reluctant to do it kid.  I have to adnit that the hostages...couldn't care less, go ahead kill 'em. Not a sympathetic one in the bunch. The actors surrounding them are mostly wooden, including James Remar and the FBI agent, what a tool. The reason for the 4 stars in the middle of a mediocre movie would be the 2 male leads, they did an admirable job for what they had to work with. Ryan Francis and Justin Walker.  Mostly I would say 3.2 stars.",1395273600,,673,4.376
7894020,5,6305611971,"I enjoy this movie for the soul fact that it's very 'Real' so to speak. A bunch of friends thinking they have an easy mission to rob a bank with no strings attached suddenly find out the consequences of their actions. You get a sense of realism from the fact that you could see something like this taking place, and the 'uh oh' factor when everything starts to snowball. I like it because it kept me at the edge of my seat.",1347840000,,423,4.170731707317073
7894021,4,6305611971,"I think this action-drama was GREAT!
At the end its really tense and I just shaked the last 15 minutes. Even if the end wasn't as good as you would like, it was still wort seeing it.
And I think the actors did a great job, even if they warent famous.",1010966400,4,250,3.9215686274509802
7894022,5,6305611971,Sure to be a cult classic!  This gripping teen crime drama got so intense at one point that my girlfriend squeezed the circulation out of my hand!  Corey Feldman is funnier than I have ever seen him.  The non-stop tension makes this picture worth buying on DVD.  You will thank me later.,983923200,4,287,4.461538461538462
7894023,3,6305611971,"If you're going to do holdups, leave it to the likes of Michael Mann to do it right. This movie just doesn't seem to cut it in the area of suspense, action, or acting, for that matter.",980380800,,184,4.0
