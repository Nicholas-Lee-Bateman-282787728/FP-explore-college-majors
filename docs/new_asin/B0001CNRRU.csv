1987421,2,B0001CNRRU,"Confused, tired, disappointed, left hanging, that is how I feel about 21 Grams.  Another feeling I had was a headache from trying to figure out all the supposed hidden meanings, and the closing monologue.

The back-and-forth-in-time scene sequence didn't work for me.  I don't necessarily believe movies should be linear (two of my favourite movies are ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"", and they are not linear in their scene sequence), but 21 Grams overdoes the non-linearity.  I kept feeling like I was cheating, as if I was skipping forward in the movie.  A linear storytelling would have worked a lot better, and made me feel more surprised when the story took a twist.
There were too many loose ends in the movie (I won't mention them, to avoid spoiling the movie for others).  I just felt like I was left hanging.
I couldn't grasp the implication of the 21 grams concept, even though I thought I understood the idea before the movie started.  I left the movie feeling confused, and quite bitter, as I felt ripped off - the supposed deeper meaning was fairly lame or unfathomable, and the movie fairly pretentious.
Excellent acting from Naomi Watts, Sean Penn and Benecio Del Toro though.",1075334400,3,1196,4.833333333333333
1987422,5,B0001CNRRU,"I could not take my eyes off the screen as I was watching this film in the theater. I believe this is one of the best movies of the year so far and I wouldn't be surprise if it doesn't get some kind of award. The acting is superb from the three leading actors. It is a movie that really makes you think about a lot of things. You can tell that is was made on a fairly low budget but I personally prefer movies that are made on a low budget in comparison to the big blockbusters. This movie is not for everyone but if you care about excellence in acting as well as movies with great storylines that make you think and question life and our existence among many other factors than this movie is for you. Sean Penn is terrific, his character is very sick and is dying and his transformation is unreal. Naomi Watts who plays Penn's girlfriend is also top notch and her character goes on an emotional rollercoaster after her husband and her two daughters are tragically killed in a car accident. Last but certainly not least is Benicio Del Toro who plays an ex-con and a reborn Christian who is deeply religious and wants to help those around him do the same also gives a fantastic performance. This film deserves to be remembered by the members of the Academy of Motion Pictures because it truly deserves to be recognized by the Hollywood elite as an amazing film with gripping performances from a fantastic cast of actors.",1074902400,,1419,4.399239543726236
1987443,2,B0001CNRRU,"I think that back-and-forthing in time was a unnecessary mind play that artificially deepened the plot. That gives the illusion of something interesting that would not be otherwise present in a serially timed plot. I think that the serial plot itself was interesting, thus an additional star. Except the main characters, every character seemed like a parody. Unnecessary sexuality that did not improve the plot spiced up the already salty movie.",1512172800,,445,5.28169014084507

1987475,3,B0001CNRRU,"This movie exemplifies the lives of those who are not wealthy, but who are trying to find their way in this difficult world, and fail.  The movie is not action, and is difficult to categorize, because it almost can be considered psychological.  It is not a thriller either...not too much anyway.  It can tear your heart out here and there, but overall, it displays a realistic example of everyday struggles with a person's own self-discipline and failure in being true to yourself, and your own philosophies.  Of course, watching this movie has only reminded me of the things about my character I dare not think about, because I don't like those components of my persona; therefore, I find this movie difficult to watch, as I am reminded of those things about me, that I try not to think about.",1475366400,3,794,4.690647482014389
1987476,4,B0001CNRRU,"Naomi Watts and Benecio del Toro turn in standout performances. Their Oscar-nominated performances didn't win the Oscar, but it hardly matters. People who care about extraordinary acting will always remember their work in 21 Grams.

All supporting actors are equally fine and memorable. Penn might be miscast as a math professor, but he's effective and lets Watts take charge of their scenes together--which is the right choice.

The movie unfolds its story in a disordered style that juxtaposes short scenes out of chronological order. This approach doesn't make sense to me and it takes a while to get used to it. Repeated viewings make the plot easier to understand. I felt like director Inarritu was trying to be different. Inarritu also injects lots of grain and includes green/yellow color cast to emphasize raw realism.

The movie offers no easy answers to these characters' fractured lives. Inarritu toys around with themes of religion and redemption but wavers between two possibilities. He wonders if some God does govern our lives, or if our lives are without meaning and shape. If, for example, God willed del Toro to hit the father and two girls, he did so with Jesus Saves on the side of his pickup. If God had no part in the accident, then violence is random and suffering is meaningless. Either God is vindictive and vengeful, or he's nowhere to be found in our lives.

These are heavy ideas that, quite frankly, no director could resolve in a 2-hour movie. He ends his movie with suggestions of renewal and healing, though the final image is an empty barren pool covered by snow, which suggests broken dreams and hopelessness.

If this all sounds depressing, it is--but it's redeemed by the amazing acting and Inarritu's compassion for these badly flawed characters.",1470528000,,1783,4.969798657718121

1987565,5,B0001CNRRU,"21 Grams is movie that in the tradition of movies such as Memento. It involves three characters namely Paul, Christina and Jack and how their lives have been interlocked with one another.

Paul, portrayed by talented actor Sean Penn, is living in bad health and having a bad relationship with his wife. Jack ,portrayed by Benicio del Torro, is person who has been in and out of jail for lot of petty crimes and who has been a Jesus Christ fanatic. While Christina, played by Naomi Watts, is a wife who has been recovering from the murder of her husband and children that were victims of a hit and run car accident and that of a drug user.

The story is told in FRAGMENTS that one has to watch attentively to the film. It is not a traditional film that is told from the beginning to end. The best comparison is probably a CD player playing song tracks of a CD at RANDOM.

This is the story of three gentle people: Paul,Christina,and Jack. They will be brought together by a terrible accident that will change their lives. By the final frame, none of them will be the same as they will learn harsh truths about love, faith, courage, desire and guilt, and how chance can change our worlds irretrievably, forever.

Personally,I have to watch the movie twice just to fully understand the movie and the development of each character. But the film proved to be worth watching for it teaches us lessons about life and spirituality. Also, the acting proved to be great and worthy of Academy Award nominations especially for Del Torro and Watts.

I recommend this film to anyone who wants movies that tells stories in a NON-TRADITIONAL manner or anyone who has seen and enjoyed Memento.",1419638400,,1676,4.591973244147157

1987570,5,B0001CNRRU,"Nine Things about the Movie 21 Grams [USA, 2003]

1. This is the second movie of Mexican director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritus Death Trilogy, coming after Amores Perros.

2. Despite what it may seem, the title is not about drugs. The movie is not about drugs. The title is a reference to an old belief that a persons soul weighs 21 grams.

3. This is not a happy movie. But it is a powerful one.

4. The less you know about the movie beforehand, the better. But I can say that its about three main characters. Jack (played by Benicio del Toro) is an ex-convict that got saved, and has turned his life over to Jesus. But his faith is not as helpful to him as it needs to be. Paul (played by Sean Penn) is a college math teacher with a fatal heart condition. Cristina (played by Naomi Watts) is a loving wife and mother that battles with substance abuse. The three characters do not know each other at the start of the movie.

5. There are two crucial moments in the movie. However, the story is not told linearly. The movie bounces from character to character, back and forth in time. Some scenes are only about 30 seconds long. Some are much longer. But they dance around the two crucial moments, making you piece it together for yourself before you actually see it.

6. Ive seen movies told out of order before, but this is extreme. The utter fragmentation of the films story bothers some people. But I thought it was brilliant. It requires more attention to detail in order to put things in order. This makes you more emotionally involved in the movie than you might otherwise be.

7. Guillermo Arriaga wrote the movie (he also wrote Amores Perros), and he has an almost supernatural ability to capture the intimate details of love and death, shining darkly between the lines of dialogue.

8. Benicio del Toro and Naomi Watts were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances. del Toro plays against type as a man desperately trying to do good, even while it seems God wants him to do bad. And Naomi Watts almost burns a hole through the screen with her scorching performance of a woman who faces grief more than once.

9. This is a gritty, surprising, angry, and tragic story that presents things on screen that Ive never seen before, and in a manner Ive never seen before. If you have emotional fortitude and a strong attention span, you will not soon forget this movie.",1404259200,3,2378,4.511627906976744
1987571,3,B0001CNRRU,Not entertainment!!  An experience!!!  Left me with more questions and few answers...  Don't really want to spend this much time on this...,1401926400,,139,5.2272727272727275
1987572,4,B0001CNRRU,Good actting in this dark tale. The story is improbable but a good vehicle for the exploration of life and death issues.,1398643200,,120,4.5
1987573,5,B0001CNRRU,"Like a freight juggernaut carrying the poisoned cargo of a screwed-up past coupled to a temptation-filled present - ex convict Jack Jordan is a train wreck waiting to derail yet again - only this time in spectacular fashion. At least at the hands of Preacher John (the ever stunning Eddie Marsan) Jack has discovered God and this has given him strength (""Jesus gave me that truck...""). But he still seems to be heading for that mental meltdown no matter how hard he believes and the inevitable loss of his freedom, his job and his family.

Mexican Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu had made the brilliant ""Amos Perres"" in 2000 and it went a long way to drawing in huge talent like Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and especially Benicio Del Toro (as Jack Jordan). Not conventionally structured - 2004's ""21 Grams"" uses the device of back and forward in time flashbacks to offer up a story of accidents and loss and extreme pain and how ordinary people cope with it (or not as the case may be).

The structure is odd and at times grating - but it brilliantly unfolds the story so you slowly twig what's happened and to whom. One minute Jack Jordan is clean-shaven happily waving to his friends by his pick-up - the next he's in a prison shower again with a towel around his neck (and he isn't trying to clear up his zits). Sean Penn's character Paul River's is wheezing on a ventilator while he sneaks a cigarette from a pill bottle stash in the bathroom in one scene - then is healthy and immaculately suited in the next scene as he ogles a woman in a swimming pool (Naomi Watts) he seems overly interested in for a married man. One moment he's raising a glass of wine with his friends celebrating an organ transplant that has literally saved his life - the next Paul is lying in a hospital bed looking battered with tubes in his mouth - ruminating on the size of the bodyweight you lose when you die (the film's title).

In between all of this we keep returning to a father (a brilliantly subtle Danny Huston) on his mobile to his wife. He is clearly not paying enough attention to his two young daughters giddily chasing a bird on the footpath ahead of him. As the three pass out of shot - leaves are blown ahead as a familiar-looking truck races past - and a few moments later (still out of shot) there's an ominous screech of tyres...

While Sean Penn is typically magnetic - the movie belongs to Benicio Del Toro who straddles it like a malevolent colossus. In the 'Making Of' the Director says you need only point the camera at him and magic will happen - worlds going on behind a glance. Yet somehow (and there are repulsive scenes with his family) Del Toro fills his tattooed enraged Jordan with such gravitas that you empathise with his gradual loss of faith rather than judge him. In one scene he begs a startled man to kill him - end his torment - and you don't for a second think that he doesn't really mean it.

But special praise should also go to the women who are simply astounding and in some cases act the showier male names off the frame. Charlotte Gainsbourg plays Sean Penn's wife Mary Rivers obsessed with having a child even if their relationship is disintegrating - while Melissa Leo plays the wife of the God-obsessed Jack Gordon trying to keep him out of jail and her family together (both are simply superb). But it's Naomi Watts who blows you away. There is a scene where she has to go the hospital to check on her husband and two daughters only to be given unfathomable news. As a parent you physically shake and ache with her harrowing disintegration (she's that good). The only other times I've ever seen this sheer acting power is in ""Bright Star"" about the life of poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne that has Abbie Cornish give the same kind of mind-blowing performance (see review) and Marion Cotillard's unbelievable performance in the Edith Piaf biopic ""La Vie En Rose"".

With a 1.85:1 Aspect Ratio (the full screen is filled) 'adequate' best describes the BLU RAY picture quality. It isn't great by any stretch of the imagination featuring many indoor and night scenes with an ever-present pallor of grain. Shooting was all about feel and immediacy - and prettily framed suburbia was never going to be part of the equation. But I'd still say that the power of the watch quickly dissipates any qualms on that front. The only subtitle is English for the Hard Of Hearing.

There's also a great ""In Fragments"" Making Of where the Director gets all the cast and crew to throw red roses in the air at the start of shooting and white roses when they finish. Each of the principal actors get spots and they're praise and love of the work is palatable. Icing on the cake is Gustavo Santaoialla's stunning score of electric and acoustic heavy guitar strums (like a Mexican Ry Cooder). Gustavo also embellished ""Babel"" and ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" with the same emotion-tugging power.

Nominated for 2 Oscars and 5 Baftas - ""21 Grams"" is visceral cinema peopled with a plethora of actors giving 1000% to a script they know is hard-hitting yet somehow real world redemptive. Inarritu would go on to make the equally brilliant ""Babel"" and the seriously harsh ""Biutiful"".

In 2014 you can pick up the stunning ""21 Grams"" for 10 bucks on BLU RAY - and that's a ten-spot well spent in my book...",1395705600,2,5307,4.560335781741868

1987608,4,B0001CNRRU,"Purchased this film after my first viewing, because I didn't quite grasp the entire story the first time around yet still found it thoroughly enjoyable.  This story follows ""a critically ill mathematician, a grieving mother, and a born-again ex-con"" whose lives all eventually become intertwined after a series of emotional events.  What stuck out to me most after having watched it a second time are the following:

Pros:
 Benicio del Toro - his acting stole the show IMO and I really gravitated towards his character
 The choppy sequencing of all the events (kept me on my toes as I tried to piece the different scenes together)
 I found the cinematography to be top-notch
 The idea of ""What lies within those 21 grams?""

Cons:
 Naomi Watts - a lot of people seemed to love her performance, while I personally didn't really care for it
 Sean Penn's character appeared to be too forced at times
 The choppy sequencing of events (at times I felt that it was unnecessary)

I would put this Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu film at a 7.2/10 after seeing it twice.  I am most certainly looking forward to checking out some of his other works (i.e., Babel, Amores Perros, and Biutiful) now that I have a faint idea of what to expect.",1367884800,,1221,4.702830188679245
1987609,4,B0001CNRRU,"This film was heartbreaking, sad, and touching in it's realism. It's one of those films that takes a little time to get in harmony with, but once there it has a lot to say about tragedy and the unfair ways life can present it's self. Benicio Del Toro was absolutely stunning in this film. A small time petty criminal that changes his life and becomes a christian, and seems to have totally gotten his life together. His faith is deep and though he sometimes finds his old ways rising to the surface once in awhile he is truly a reformed man. Then tragedy strikes when he accidentally hit's a man and his two children while driving and kills them. He's torn to pieces by this and turns him self in. Doing the only thing he can do that he feels is just even if it destroys himself and his family. On the other side of this story, Sean Penn plays an ill man with a bad heart who recieves the heart of the man who was killed by the truck driven by Del Toro's character, This has an impact on Penn's character who feels compelled to discover what happened to the man who's heart was transplanted into him. Along the way he finds the man's broken wife, played beautifully by Naomi Watts, and they strike up a friendship that helps both of them heal from their tormented lives. In the end these people must face serious decisions, that could lead to murder or forgivness. And the result is simply riveting and touching. I must say Del Toro has become one of my very favorite actors. He has the face of a Bronson meets Cagney sort of guy, who can play some tough characters, but he can also play people with tender emotions. I just love Del Toro. Even on the same screen with a heavy hitter like Sean Penn, he simply overshadows him in this film.",1367625600,,1738,4.3343558282208585

Why devote two hours of your valuable time to 21 GRAMS, a film so many Amazon reviewers found distasteful and fractured beyond comprehension? Let me tell you why, very briefly. 21 GRAMS isn't just a movie, it's a piece of art--that is, through watching it, through witnessing the events in the film, viewers are given the opportunity to learn something very important about themselves. It's a film that demands introspection from its viewers, which so many of us find uncomfortable. 21 GRAMS might catch you by surprise, put a lump in your throat, and might make you question the value of your life, but make no mistake, it's all for good reason. Few films have explored the notions of what it means to be a living human being, to lose loved ones, to live with the guilt of causing insurmountable pain to others, to lose one's faith, or the complexity of a dimmed existence as deeply as this film does. It's frightening. It's intimate. It's beautiful. I feel very sorry for the many reviewers who missed the opportunity to ask themselves the tough questions 21 GRAMS poses in its conclusion.

The ""Pulp Fiction Method"" of putting together a movie was a strange but interesting concept for Pulp Fiction, but that doesn't mean that such an unorthodox presentation is going to work well for any movie in general. And I believe Pulp Fiction was cut into probably a fourth as many pieces as this one, causing this movie to drive me crazy watching it. Watching a movie should be a relaxing, enjoyable activity, rather than something that rattles your brain as much as a tough crossword puzzle.

Goofy sequencing aside, I really enjoyed the 3 main actors' performances. The story kind of reminded me of the movie ""Crash"" where you watch all these little subplots and then see how they all come together. This was quite a realistic movie...how the characters reacted to their situations was pretty much what everyday people would do, I think. RECOMMENDED.",1295395200,2,996,4.790697674418604
1987640,3,B0001CNRRU,"I rented this movie because, well, you can put Benicio Del Toro in anything and I'll watch it at least once. And it sounded interesting.

So, bearing in mind the depressing storyline, I sat down to watch ""21 Grams"". And through the entire thing, I looked away maybe once or twice. It's a downer, for sure, and the word that comes to mind when I think back on it is ""oppressive"". There's something about this film that holds you down and forces its way into your mind and there's no escaping it. I couldn't even say if I liked it or not until I'd watched it about five times, and then I didn't shut up for about a week, telling everyone how much I loved it.

The only reason I knocked a couple of stars off is... I HATED Naomi Watts' character. SO MUCH. At first I was sympathetic because she lost her husband and her two daughters and all that, but then all of a sudden she was screwing Sean Penn (who clearly had given up on life and thus I was slightly better able to put myself in his position, but only slightly) and I just didn't give a flying fart in space anymore. She didn't deserve sympathy at that point, especially not after  taking out a personal vendetta on a stranger for something that was an accident. If it were me, sure, I'd be angry as Hell and I would never be the same, but an accident is still an accident.

Which brings me to dear Jack Jordan. Poor guy. He was trying to turn his life around, trying to redeem himself for all the things he'd done in the past, and it just wasn't going to happen that way. The guilt he felt, it was tangible in Del Toro's green eyes.

Anyway... See this movie. Even if only once.",1293840000,,1634,4.207667731629393
1987641,5,B0001CNRRU,"""21 Grams"" is the sort of movie which sucks the life out of you--I don't think there is one agony in the human conditioned left unturned, one painful rock left uncovered, one intimation of the fragility of human existence left without inspection in this movie.  Then, like the natural cycles of life, the sun shines meekly when the night gets darkest.

Director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu provides with a scathing glimpse into the lives of three people for whom life has indeed become little else, particularly for Sean Penn's character Paul, a cynical mathematics professor for whom life has become little more than a long convalescence: the victim of a fatal heart condition, he is slowly dying but shows rather negative signs of vitality.  He refuses to stop smoking and recognizes that his wife, played unlikably well by Charlotte Gainsbourg, has never been the one for him.  She badgers him for a sample of his sperm with the process of artificial insemination and it does not seem to the viewer that it is out of any concern for him or a desire to ""continue"" his existence in some way: it is for her own satisfaction and hope for a new life.  Rather than taking the safe route, he elects to die outside the hospital than taking the advice of his doctor and dying in the hospital.

Christina (Naomi Watts) is a woman with a husband and three children and a recovering cocaine addict. Her life has become more stable as her attention is directed towards the welfare of her family. A car crash involving Jack, an ex-con turned Christian, turns all of their lives around forever. This film is completely non linear, but unlike ""Memento"" or ""Mulholland Drive"" it does not take multiple viewings to show what is happening.  If you really concentrate you'll understand.

Neither of the aforementioned actors--Penn, Del Toro, or Watts--have transcended the work they did in this film.  The acting is fantastic, and I have to disagree with some viewers' about it being ""hopeless"": the subtext about Penn and his warning shot at the end, which brings everything together, is what brings salvation.  It is gritty and true to real life, almost uncomfortably so--you'd think you were watching a documentary with amazingly sincere people at times--but it is no way hopeless.

This ranks among one of the best films I've seen to emerge in this decade.  Highly recommended!",1290556800,3,2361,4.860349127182045

1987643,5,B0001CNRRU,"I'm a fan of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.  Sure, he dwells within the realms of his `one-trick' and some define him as gimmicky (interwoven character arcs thriving within a convoluted structure) but he knows how to make that `gimmick' sing for all it's worth.  He did it with `Amores Perros' and he does it here too.  He also did it with `Babel', but to a less than magnificent result.

`21 Grams' may be his best film to date.

The film tells the complicated and heartrending story of a young woman named Christina who is drawn into the lives of two men after a tragic accident leaves her widowed.  One of those men is Paul, a professor in dire need of a heart transplant.  The other man is Jack, an ex-convict who has turned his life over to god in order to atone for his sins, one of which being the cause of Christina's predicament.

Yes, Jack killed her husband.

Shifting back and forth within time, `21 Grams' weaves a delicate web of harsh realities that brings the audience to a dark place thriving with life.  The complexities are all held tightly within these three amazingly real characters, all of which come to life in vivid and mesmerizing ways.  My first viewing of this film left me rather spellbound.  I knew it wasn't perfect (not many films are), but it also had such a strong hold on my emotions that I was compelled to watch it again and again and again.  Every time I see this film I am rushed with more emotions, for it remains real and compelling every time.  The reality that life is fragile and that life is every changing seeps through every pore of this film.  You can't help but watch these shattered souls and wonder how they make it through.  Their struggles are so deeply felt, so richly realized.  Some have balked at the films unending sense of torment, but for me it never really becomes something unbelievably harsh.  `21 Grams' uses the darker realities of life as a stepping stone to establish human tendencies and the need within us all to survive.  It also shows the will we have to right the wrongs and redeem ourselves through the survival of others.

As depressing as this film is, it is strangely uplifting upon reflection.

The performances here are all stellar, especially from Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts.  Watts, one of the greatest actresses of her generation (a few pegs shy of Kate Winslet), delivers a gut punch performance here.  Some call this performance too dramatic, but I think that that particular perception may be poisoned by the films narrative flow.  It only seems dramatic because the pieces are not in order.  When you consider how she builds her character and look at it from that view then you see a completely realized character.  She understands how to live within the character.  You can see her taking in every moment, and it helps create someone truly unforgettable.  Del Toro is one of the better actors working today.  This performance is most certainly his finest to date.  The way he drenches himself in his character determination, allowing his every fault to become his driving force; it's unmistakably solid.  Instead of falling into the clich&eacute; of playing a `Jesus Freak' with obviousness, he underscores a generic character with flourishes of purpose and understanding.  Sean Penn, an actor I find highly overrated, is very good here.  This performance is FAR better than his hammy Oscar winning one from the same year (how he one of `Mystic River' is beyond me).  He understands the subtlety that is needed to highlight to unnerving reality befalling this man.  You can see him slowly withering away within his own solitude.

The supporting cast is also magnificent here, especially the significant others played by Danny Huston, Melissa Leo and Charlotte Gainsbourg.

In the end I highly recommend this film.  It is an eternal downer at first glance, so be prepared to take your mood down a few notches, but the rich script allows for the emotions to display themselves in interesting and provoking ways, and this is definitely a film that will continue to provoke you to think, and glean.",1282867200,7,4084,4.740425531914894

1987645,2,B0001CNRRU,"21 Grams is a dark, daring story of three sad lives.  The actors give fine performances, but the movie is hard to watch - way too much drama and with the emotions running rough and  relentless. This movie did far too many flashbacks and then before you can take one scene in, another segment of time flashes quickly before you grasp the meaning.

The three main characters played by Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts are constantly striving to overcome addictions and life hardships.  Over a period of several months, an accident throws their fates together.  The overwrought drama of faith, redemption, love and mortality is draining to watch.  The sadness of drug addiction, infertility, organ transplants, low socioeconomic lives, and con men is definitely drama overkill.

21 Grams takes dogged determination to watch.  Just putting the thrashing scenes and pieces of their lives together makes one dizzy.  There is nothing other than boredom throughout as the dark, graphic, morbid, mess of three lives was irritating to the senses.",1269993600,,1047,5.076023391812866
1987646,5,B0001CNRRU,"21 GRAMS is a film of such importance that attempting to review it is intimidating. Once in a while a film appears that is a Benchmark, a film that is destined to alter the concept of moviemaking as an art form. That this is only the second film from the obviously prodigiously gifted co-writer and Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ( the strikingly creative and disturbing 'Amores Perros' being his first) serves the craft well in continuing the promise of film as art.
Inarritu enlists the intelligence of his audience and what a partnership that creates! His ""style"" is called non-linear which merely means that the story of the film is not spoon fed to us in a ""this happens, then this resulted, then this altered, then this happened"" etc fashion. Inarritu takes advantage of the fact that visual images can hold so much power that the story behind them seems secondary at the moment of viewing only to alert us to THINK as we see bits and pieces of history and result dangling from a mobile, ever in motion. We are led to believe one thing depending on how we relate to the image on the screen, and then we are shown that we misjudged that event as we are given more detail from the past and from the future.

While this technique may sound difficult to follow, Inarritu uses it with such facility that learning the true story being told is similar to the way we are running through life: we see fragments, remember tiny moments, watch the media alter variations of reporting reality, hear gossip, view events with prejudiced eyes, form opinions based on our individual experiences with like events in our own lives, or in other words always be faced with the question of what are the drivers of accidents/fate/destiny/need/passion.

The story is basically one of how three disparate characters' lives complexly intertwine - people who come to a fatal auto crash with very different life patterns. A mathematics professor with severe heart disease, a reformed drug addict mother who happens to be the wife and mother of the victims, and a Bible thumping ex-con who drives the truck that causes the accident. The events that ensue after the crash (the victim a heart transplant donor for the mathematician, the devastation the event has on the perpetrator and on the surviving wife) are the storylines we follow. The ending is an intelligent, shocking surprise and one that alters the way you will view events and people after you leave the story behind.
Inarritu has employed the gifted artists Sean Penn, Benecio Del Toro, and Naomi Watts and each of them gives the most potent performances of their careers to date. It is impossible to single out the strongest one as each actor owns the full spectrum of each character and each performance seems to exude from their innermost core of their talent. Each is powerful, subtle, sensitive, wholly credible and deeply moving. The other cast members are very strong - especially Clea DuVall and Charlotte Gainsbourg who take their seemingly supportive roles to heights of such importance that it seems the story could not progress without them.
The photography is appropriately and conceptually dark and the quality of the picture has a decadent graininess to it that enhances the mood and the perplexing mystery of the story. But in the final analysis it is the magisterial directing talent of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu that is simply mind-boggling. This is a VERY important film, so very much worth the work required from us the audience, and as with most things in life, the more we invest the more we gain. Well worth 10 Stars!

1987664,5,B0001CNRRU,"21 Grams is a movie which has three parallel thread stories which seem to be unconnected but the movie progresses it becomes apparent that all three stories and characters are connected.

The thread stories are

1) Sean Penn plays a critically ill academic mathematician,
2) Noami Watts plays a grief stricken mother,
3) Benicio Del Toro plays an ex-convict who has newly discovered Christianity

All three characters center around a tragic automobile accident.

The movie although shot in  chronological order, is edited in a non-linear arrangement where the lives of the characters are depicted before and after the accident. The random order in which the 'before' and 'after' bits of the 3 stories are mixed around, could confuse some viewers who are not attentive or who don't want to take the effort. This movie requires a bit of serious viewing. But it's different and novel. When the end, start and middle of the movie are mish mashed around, it breaks down our formal thinking process of a first, middle and last act of the movie. It also adds suspense and curiosity to see what transpired in between when we see the start,end and certain middle parts one after the other and then spend the rest of the time curious to know what happened in between and to fit the pieces of the puzzle. Not a conventional film, not for everyone but a good film neverthless.

And the title ""21 grams"" actually refers to suppossed loss of weight when a person dies. So when a body dies it looses the soul and in the movie we are told 21 grams is what the 'soul' weighs and we thus weigh lesser by 21 grams after death.

If the point of the film was that a soul is way more than just the biological 21 gram weight...well.....never mind!

When one boils down the entire plot and it's moral, why did director Alejandro Inaritu need to jerk us back and forth making us as nauseated as Sean Penn was in this film?

1987667,4,B0001CNRRU,"This was an extremely moving film that pulls no punches yet beautifully avoids passing judgment.  Del Toro is Jack Jordan, a seemingly normal guy who commits a most horrific crime - in a hit and run, he kills a man and his two daughters, condemning Cristina (Naomi Watts), a mother and wife to a life of endless grief and hatred.  Separated, Jack and Cristina endure a living death.  Guilt-ridden Jack will consign himself to prison and find religion an apt avenue for suicide.  Cristina, it turns out, had an especially unstable life before being settled down by marriage, and with her family gone, turns back to chemical bereavement counseling.  Jack wants nothing more than punishment, and Cristina is all too ready to satisfy Jack's need.

And then there's Paul, the man who finally brings the two of them together.  A mathematician with a terminal heart, condition and a marriage to match, Paul receives Cristina's husband's heart, and then court her.  Paul thinks himself a hero, doubtless, taking Cristina out for lunch, driving her home from clubs when she's had one-too-many.  But Cristina has an influence on Paul as well - a negative one.

This flick charts the emotional rollercoaster of Jack, Paul and Cristina's lives.  The film plays out of chronological sequence, but hardly out of order.  Like a ride, it has its fast moments and its slow ones, milking the maximum emotional velocity by playing its scenes to a climax before returning to an earlier point in the story.  The effect is at times incomprehensible but also unforgettable.  Suffice it to say, this is the perfect movie for people who like to see the same movie more than once.

1987697,4,B0001CNRRU,"I was tempted to entitle this review, ""Too clever by half"" but I would have been guilty of the same....Another title that came to mind was ""Needs Heart Transplant"" but I rejected that for the same reason.

On the positive side, most of the acting is superb.  Sean Penn is never less than great and he does not disappoint here.  Benicio de Toro's performance was beyond brilliant.  Naomi Watts was the weakest in my opinion. (I loved her in The Painted Veil.) She relied on looking pale and blank and tensing her jaw too many times to show any number of emotions and somehow I found her just blah.  She looks good, though, so men might overlook her pallor.  I think any number of other actresses would have done a better job. Kate Winslett and Julianne Moore both come to mind.  Melissa Leo, as del Toro's wife was perfect in her role.

The story is smart.  It's full of thought provoking elements.  Perhaps too many to be digested in the space of one film.  This might be a good opener for a discussion group on any number of subjects:  addiction, religion, abortion, marriage, suicide, heart transplants, etc.

That brings me back to ""ambitious."" There's nothing wrong with that, but I was so overwhelmed with the intensity of the content, that I numbed out, and by the end, I really didn't care about any of them.  Except Jack Jordan (del Toro's character) and his family.

I found the technique of cutting back and forth in time more confusing than intriguing. As others have mentioned, it seems largely for the sake of being arty.  A little mercy for the viewer would have been welcome.  It did all come together, but too late in the film, for my taste, and by that time, I had stopped caring. If it had been filmed in a more sequential way, I think I would have been able to sustain my ability to  keep my heart open to these characters.  Also, the ratio of misery to joy was severely imbalanced, in my opinion and this had the effect of  numbing me.

I agree with another reader who complained that the characters played by Penn and Watts were not fully written.  Penn's, especially.  He's portrayed as a real cold character, but when he gets the heart (transplant) of the good, famiy loving man, he warms up....but only to the widow of the dead man, not to his own wife, who wants desperately to stay in the marriage and have his child. Penn, by his natural humanity, makes us care about him, but that's a gift I think he gave to the script.

The Watts character didn't hold together much for me.  She's portrayed as the loving wife, mother, sister and daughter, but then there is another, darker part of her that I think we should have seen earlier in order to make sense of her later meltdown.  True, she was given an enormous blow, but others have suffered similar things without resorting to drugs and murder.

I have to give special mention to Jack Jordan, (del Toro).  The character is written with great depth and compassion and acted accordingly.  I was only going to give this film three stars but for that I add a fourth.  He is the one, troubled as he was, who comes through with the real heart.

Another reader wrote that ""the intricate screenplay isn't half as smart as it thinks it is"" and I think he has a point.  It seems that the goal of the film is to impress.  If you want to be impressed, and don't mind being de-pressed in the bargain, then this might be the film for you.",1178409600,6,3400,4.441033925686591

1987701,5,B0001CNRRU,"Filmmaker Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu's penchant for non-linear chronology in his cinematic storytelling is perhaps at its most heightened in this powerful 2003 drama. Having seen the other two superb films in his trilogy meditating on death, 1999's ""Amores Perros"" set in his native Mexico and last year's ambitiously international ""Babel"", I fully expected Irritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriago to deliver something as audacious. Indeed they have with a gritty, heartfelt look at three disparate lives brought together by a single twist of fate and how each copes uniquely with the aftermath. Executed with even greater abandon than the other two films, the sequencing of plot developments in ""21 Grams"" is initially confusing, but the out-of-kilter pacing actually fits the jagged contours of the desultory story which deals with the unpredictability of life.

The relentlessly downbeat tone can get wearing at least until the plot threads start to come together with greater force in the last third. The plot follows three people facing deeply personal challenges - Paul Rivers, an academic awaiting a donor for a life-saving heart transplant, as his impatient, English-born wife wants his sperm to have a baby by artificial insemination; Jack Jordan, an ex-con and born-again Christian struggling to keep a job to support his wife and two kids; and Cristina Peck, a happily devoted wife and mother who has a history of drug problems. Their lives intersect through a hit-and-run which results in fatalities and burgeoning flows of anger, guilt and resentment. Brief, time-juggled snippets of their individual lives are interspersed with obviously later scenes when the three come together under dire circumstances. Divulging any more of the story - which was apparently filmed chronologically despite the final editing - would dampen the propulsive dynamics generated by the constant second-guessing by the viewer.

Fortunately, the three principals act with such fervent commitment to their characters that it is hard not to be compelled by the film in its entirety. In the most subdued performance of the trio, Sean Penn effectively plays Rivers as a dying man hoping to find some level of redemption for second chance he gets, often reacting with quiet force to the actions occurring around him. As Jack, Benicio del Toro is unafraid to exhibit the character's ugly side while sharply conveying his inability to cope with what he sees as his accountability in the tragic event. With a series of bravura moments, Naomi Watts lends palpable ferocity and a liberating lack of vanity to Cristina's inner torment.  There are a couple of sideline performances worth noting as well - Charlotte Gainsborough as Paul's insular wife Mary and especially Melissa Leo as Jack's tough-minded, self-protecting wife Marianne.

The film has an intentionally bleached-out look thanks to Rodrigo Prieto's atmospheric cinematography, but the most impressive achievement is the filmmakers' insightful presentation of complex, multi-layered characters in ways that make these even their more unsavory actions understandable. Unfortunately, the original 2004 DVD offers no extras, but the 2006 Collector's Edition DVD does include the theatrical trailer and an interesting behind-the-scenes featurette, ""21 Grams in Fragments"", which spends a lot of time on the director's fascination with death and his motivation in making the film.",1168560000,4,3419,5.457466918714556
1987702,5,B0001CNRRU,"21 Grams is a heavy movie - despite a light title.  The story is about the collisions, literal and figurative, between three imperfect people:  A religeous fanatic with a dark past, a cheating husband with a critical heart problem, and a drug addicted widow.  The movie operates as a series of flashbacks and fast-forwards, much along the lines of Amores Perros and City of God.  It's a bit faster, which makes it optimal to see the movie in one sitting to keep up.  (I saw it in several, which detracted from the viewing)

In the end it's easy to see the movie as a work of art.  It's best at it's darkest.  People really don't lose 21 Grams when they die, and the spiritual side is weaker.  Even with that, if you like the genre, you'll like the movie, even if it's not as solid as others.  All movies don't need to fit the Hollywood stereotype.",1168387200,,847,4.371794871794871

1987705,5,B0001CNRRU,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's '21 Grams' I personally found to be an immensely satisfying experience. Much like Inarritu's `Amores Perros' (2001) and `Magnolia' (1999, Anderson) it's a tale of three lives brought together by an accident. However this time the story is told with a completely non-linear sense of structure that I found to be really refreshing. `Amores Perros' and `Magnolia' still had a sense of A - B - C - D in it's structure while jumping around between three stories whereas 21 Grams has an A - C - B -D (although more developed) structure while moving between it's three stories creating a unified mesh of their lives. Some things we only really find out towards the end but at no time did I find this confusing. This is important because were not actually watching three separate stories that have a link, as in `Amores Perros', but one and it's that which I felt I appreciated. By using this method Inarritu manages to create memories that are carried with the characters through the film instead of using a dreaded flashback sequences.

What really impressed me though was the acting. Sean Penn (Dead Man Walking; The Thin Red Line) is one of the few actors who has grown and matured to be a real force in modern cinema and delivers another great performance. Benicio del Toro (Traffic, Usual Suspects, Sin City) and Naomi Watts (Mullholland Drive) are both quite brilliant delivering impressive performances also. Cinematography was again by Rodrigo Prieto who recently photographed `Brokeback Mountain' (2005).

I personally found this film to be better than `Amores Perros' and I look forward to Inarritu's next film. If you like this then you may also enjoy director Wong-Kai Wai's films, which I believe to be greater. See `Chungking Express' (1994) and `In The Mood For Love' (2000) which I place in my top 100.",1161043200,,1841,4.897435897435898

The genius of the film is how the story is told.  The film jumps around quite liberally showing events in the lives of the three main characters (Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, and Benicio Del Toro) before and after the seminal event that brings them together.  Because of this, it takes quite some time to figure out what is going on, which might turn off a lot of viewers.

In ""21 Grams,"" a bloated religious allegory about the nature of good and evil, fate and free will, their skill as actors keeps us engaged despite the relentless misery on the screen.  These three performances, plus that of Melissa Leo as Del Toro's earthy wife, will make the long, painful journey to the final credits mostly worth your time.

Faith, sin, addiction, personal responsibility and redemption figure heavily in the plot.  Just in case the audience doesn't get the New Testament references, the main characters are named Christina, Mary, Marianne, Paul, and Jack (John).  Even their last names are symbolic:  Jordan and Rivers (get it?).  The main characters come from different strata of society and would probably never meet under normal circumstances.  But their worlds collide randomly and violently, and out of the rubble come death, hope and new life.  Interestingly, the message I got from ""21 Grams"" was that the will to go on, to face ones failings, and to embrace love and the unknowable future are not gifts given by God, but choices one makes all on ones own.  The Church is portrayed not necessarily as an instrument of salvation, but as a rigid, dogmatic tangle of inconsistencies that does more to confuse than to enlighten.  I'm not sure this was the filmmakers' intention, and this lack of clarity points to one of the flaws in an overwrought film salvaged by extraordinary performances.

The non-linear approach to the narrative was a plus.  It was challenging to decipher and held my interest. However, too many disjointed, unnecessary scenes took too long to come together; thus, the pacing was slow and at times, even boring.  Prudent editing could have made a difference.

The characterizations of Watts and Penn are superficially written, and we know very little about them or their motivations.  It is to the actors' credit (and the director's) that they do such poignant and expressive work.  Most impressive of all, Benicio Del Toro miraculously, often wordlessly, fully embodies a deep and decent man beaten down by deprivation and hard luck, forced finally by circumstance to choose between self-loathing and death, or forgiving himself and living in an imperfect world with the family that loves him.

Don't see this film if you're very depressed, grief-stricken over a loss and haven't processed your feelings yet, or just want to be superficially entertained.  By the way, ""21 grams"" refers not only to the cocaine that is Christina's personal demon, but also the theoretical weight of the soul.  We learn this esoteric fact right at the end, when we are already so wrung out that its inclusion feels redundant and a bit precious.  If only the editor had had a bigger say, maybe ""21 Grams"" would have been 21 minutes shorter, tighter and clearer.",1154217600,2,2852,4.987315010570825

1987733,4,B0001CNRRU,"21 Grams is a morally egregious and disparately bleak tale from writer Guillermo Arriaga and director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who previously directed Amores Perros.  The film follows the lives of three characters - Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is a Mathematician on the verge of death who is awaiting a heart transplant, Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a mother of two girls who lives a peaceful life with her husband in a sort of suburban paradise, and Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-con who has been ""born again"" and is finally straightening out his alcoholic/violent past.  The plot follows an interconnected experience leading all three to an unyielding despair, which carries the plot forward to the finale that the audience is shown minutes into the movie.  Before I proceed much further, I should say that the following review is a **SPOILER**.  Additionally, I won't touch on the debate that seems to be highlighted rather well already about the Memento styled, gallivanting narration method.

Jack Jordan has seemingly turned his life around, the previous ex-con has been born-again and is living a two year stint away from crime and alcohol until his God given truck accidentally collides with Cristina Peck's husband and two children.  The accident is critical enough that all three die, and when Cristina finds out, it ultimately leads her down a road of despair resulting in drug use and premarital sex with her interconnected boyfriend Paul Rivers.  As the story unfolds, we learn that Cristina's recourse to holding on to her family to the point of suicidal type self-destruction is something she always thought was necessary.  As she encounters her father at the funeral, he begins the echoing chorus of ""life goes on,"" and Cristina bursts into anger over his past indifference at her mother's death, she proceeds to ask how anyone could possibly just go on given the circumstances, which is a question that is ultimately posed to the audience.

Paul Rivers enters the plot when he receives the life saving heart transplant he needed from Cristina's husband and decides that he needs to find the donor so he can properly thank them.  But when Paul encounters Cristina, he quickly becomes infatuated and can't bring himself to tell her about the transplant until they are both well on their way to a licentious affair.  As the movie proceeds, Cristina convinces Paul to help her kill Jack Jordan, the man who hit and ran her family to their death and who received a slap on the wrist.  Jack is found and Paul decides to spare him, until a final showdown of sorts is provoked by Jack and Paul shots himself from the despair of the situation.

The subplot of the story follows the children of Jack, Cristina, and Paul.  Jack and his wife Marianne have two young children whose future lies in the possible change in their ex-con father.  Paul Rivers's wife Mary has decided to use his sperm to artificially inseminate herself with a child, who represents her hope of recovering a piece of the long broken relationship between herself and Paul.  Cristina is notified at the end of the movie that she is pregnant, and I am guessing that the father is her dead husband; the nurse who notifies her suggests that she turn her life around and take care of her unborn baby.

One of the most striking lines in the movie, which by the way has outstanding script, is when Jack's wife confronts him in jail after he has turned himself in for the hit and run.  Marianne is upset that Jack's newfound relationship with Christ has led him to turn away from his family, and she confronts him with an overwhelmingly pungent line of ""Life has to go on Jack. With or without God.""  This line echoes through the lives of the three characters throughout the film, and is ultimately proven wrong when Paul Rivers takes his life because of his intense despair.  All three characters are fighting a battle that is both emotionally draining and morally challenging.  The question is, given these circumstances how could anyone come out of this situation without harming themselves?  The answer lays in the life goes on dialogue, and the answer is that life doesn't go on without God; it will always lead to a despair that leads to self destruction.  Now one may ask how this is the case for Jack since he has seemingly tried the God thing, and it obviously didn't work for him.  But the problem with Jack's newfound faith is that it never went beyond an artificial relationship of giving and taking into a relationship of love.  This is shown when Jack turns from God because he has received a bum deal in his opinion, he has given up everything for God and in turn he was given a truck that circumstantially led him to kill three people.  But the guilt Jack has comes from his own lack of love for his family, for God, and for the family he killed...he ran away from all three.  The hope of the story lies in the future children in each family, and as Mary Rivers is looking for generational healing, so too are Jack and Cristina.

This film is beautifully shot, well scripted, and superbly acted.  All three performances deserved an Oscar.  The film will also challenge anyone who is willing to sit through the bleak plot to examine their lives and ponder what they would do in a similar situation.",1137542400,3,5296,4.737472766884531
1987734,5,B0001CNRRU,"We watched 21 Grams last night.

To counteract the severely intense, tragic film we watched Leno's monolog about half-way through and, after the movie was over, Seinfeld Season Five's ""The Marine Biologist."" Even with humor during and after, we still went to bed feeling depressed.

This is not a film for the faint of heart (or even faint of mind). It requires one to suspend all hope and pay attention to the slow, choppy unfolding of the story.

As others have noted, this film unravels in a distinctly non-linear fashion -- story lines overlapping, backing up, coming at you from the past (or the future - hard to say which), all interspersed to tell the tale of three couples whose lives intersect in tragic, unexpected ways. (Remember Memento? This film owes a lot to that ground-breaking effort.)

Death, drugs, tragedy, sex, hopelessnes, spiritual and emotional devastation -- all these themes and images are pounded into the viewer from people whose lives have forever fallen apart.

Sean Penn is riveting, as usual. But so are Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts (who, I think, turned in the performance of her career).

All I could think about while I watched the movie was this: Life turns on a dime. At any given moment, my life could take a turn like the lives of these characters. Many lives take that turn every single day, and the downward spiral begins. That fear of sudden devastation chilled me to the bone the whole time I watched film. So, in effect, even though this isn't a traditional thriller or horror movie, it still scared the hell out of me.

1987764,5,B0001CNRRU,"This is film has received a lot of heated discussion, so I think I'll keep it relatively short, for once. The big debate surrounds the nonlinear narrative, with many suggesting that it isn't really necessary, and actually hurts the film.  I'll admit, I kinda agree with these people- it ain't really needed.  However, I don't think it really hurts it, even if it is a sorta needless affectation.

The unconventional narrative is especially strange considering that this is largely a three person character-study and acting showcase.  Right now I'm gonna reveal a little more of the plot than is typical for the reviews for this.  I don't think it'll hurt you to read it, but consider yourself warned:  '21 Grams' centers around the aftermath of a car accident, focusing on the effects it has on Jack, the man who caused the accident, Cristina, the wife and mother of those who were killed in it, and the terminally ill man, Paul, who receives a heart transplant from one of the victims.  Needless to say, their lives become intertwined afterward.  Honestly, it hasn't got much of a plot at all, really, but the three leads all provide stunning, moving performances.  Benicio Del Toro is the best of them as the bulky and tattooed born-again ex-con who causes the tragic auto accident that sets off the core events of the film.  He's a more complex character than you might expect, as he falls apart, his life which he barely got under some sort of control suddenly collapsing through a combination of bad luck and negligence.  There are a number of scenes of his regret which are just just so sad and powerful.  Frankly, they easily coulda been clich and cheap, but Benicio completely pulls them off.  Naomi Watts plays a devastated widow and former druggie who's sliding back to her old life.  Fortunately, the script allows her a wider range than one might anticipate, even if she only expresses anger and grief.  Also, when she starts screaming her head off it's actually believable, both in the performance and the context, a rarity in the films I've seen.  Penn is the weakest of the leads, as Paul, but he's still excellent.  I'm not that big of a Penn fan.  His roles are always convincing, for sure, but his characters have never really struck me as all that interesting. (Seems like everything I've seen him in he's a taciturn cynic who is usually fairly well reserved but has the potential to explode.)  He still plays this basic role much of the time in the film, but he is slowly revealed as the film goes on, and proves to be a truly sympathetic individual at the end.

I suppose that's what this all comes down to.  I became very interested in and attached to these characters, moreso than in the vast majority of the other films I've seen.  And frankly, that's not usually the sorta thing I'm big on.  We got plenty of real people in the world, so show me something new, or different or whatever, when you're making a film.  Still, I'll have to admit that most of my very favorite films manage to have a strong human element in them.  The real problem is that most films simply can't pull it off, can't make characters that are real and sympathetic enough to be worth watching.  '21 Grams' does it, or it did for me, anyway.  It is perhaps a little too drawn out, at times, or redundant, or seemed to be at the time anyway, but watching these people is what this movie is about.  Take it or leave it.

The film has a grainy, grimy look and appears to have been shot with handheld cameras almost exclusively.  Some have complained about this, but I like the gritty look, particularly the colors.  It is pretty damn grainy at times, I'll admit, but again, I'm pretty sure that's how it's meant to be.  It's got a sad, stirring soundtrack as well, mostly used relatively sparingly.  The dialogue is fluid and natural, but still with a few of those powerful, memorable 'movie moments' that probably wouldn't ever happen in real life, but you buy them anyway.

I dunno if there is that much more to say.  With a film like this it's tough to really say why it works so well.  You'll just have to see for yourself.  It's certainly not for everyone, as the unconventional structure will irritate some, the slow pace others, and the exceedingly dark subject matter still others.  And, honestly, it is perhaps the slightest bit pretentious.  But, it reaches high enough that the fact that it thinks it's a maybe a little bit more than it is doesn't hurt it too much, when you look at what it has got.

Edit: After watching this movie a second time I am somewhat less impressed.  The fact that none of it really adds up too anything in particular proves more irritating the second time thru, and the performances lose a bit of their impact.  Still, it's very good, but I'd probably now bring it down to 4 stars, if I were allowed to do so.

Hmm, turns out that wasn't so short after all.

1987765,4,B0001CNRRU,"21 Grams uses powerful performances to explore themes of guilt, revenge and redemption but the movie's use of out of sequence scenes ala Quentin Tarantino and Atom Agoyan results in a less than satisfying film. The acting is powerful but overstated and the tone is dark and foreboding even at the end where the director intended the film to be uplifting.

By contrast, Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter uses understated performances which alow the jaxtaposed events (in a cold foreboding enviromnent) to build to a transcendent conclusion you don't see coming.

Tarantino's use of juxtaposed sequences allows the viewer a detachment from the events that depersonalizes the quite personal (violent) events creating an original experience.

Alejandro Narritu is clearly influenced by both of these directors. I can only say 21 Grams can be enjoyed for the performances. The director didn't get it right, should continue to study his craft, and wait for his own vision to emerge.

21 grams is a deep movie and will require the watcher's full attention. It won't all make sense until the end because of the way that it is formatted. The movie is so original because it throws random scenes at the screen. One might be from the past..one from the future..etc.. For example, one scene you see Benicio Del Torro in prison, the next in a church, the next as a construcion worker. One scene you see Sean Penn bleeding to death, the next smoking, the next driving his car. Now that's what is so original and genius about the movie...it makes you open your mind and the scipt is brilliantly conceived.
You will be scratching your head at times and be like ""what is going on?"" because the movie's goal is to connect all of these scenes in the end. It makes you watching till the wonderful conclusion.

There is no need in talking about the plot because that was something that I enjoyed discovering on my own during the movie. It includes vengeance, tragedies, life and death, and change. Some characters go from being happy to depressed and drug users; others change from violent to religious; others go from dying to being saved.
The movie has cruel ironies a plenty and the movie is so powerful that you will be thinking about it for a while. Everything in this movie has a message and a point so pay attention.
21 grams is one of the best movies out there..as well as one of the most tragic. It is a must see and can be comapred to the movie Crash. But 21 grams is a better movie for many reasons. The acting is better in 21 grams as is the originalty and the script. Where Crash has difficulties with unrealism and being corny and cheesy, 21 grams does not as it always stays realistic, original and splendid.
The scene where the boy is using the leaf blower is wonderfully done. To see the car pass by, him drop the leaf blower without showing anything graphic like most movies would..wow. This way is much better and much more powerful. So please watch this gem, one of the best movies out there, a must see.",1131148800,27,2300,4.386416861826698

What made this movie so intriguing was three people from three very different backgrounds, due to some inexplicable circumstances put them together.  Their universe basically collided and with that came fireworks of unimaginable kind.  The ""behind the scene"" was useful to allow us to understand in-depth of the Director's various decisions.  All actors interviewed talked about the movie and the roles that they played candidly.  On the screen, those magnificent actors and actress in the form of Benicio, Sean and Naomi were superb.  We really couldn't take our eyes off them.  Their performances were compelling and that's probably what made 21 Gram so watchable.

1987771,4,B0001CNRRU,"From director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, the story of 21 Grams links three people who are united by very tragic circumstances.  Paul (Sean Penn) is terminally ill, but finds a new lease on life after receiving a heart transplant from the recently deceased husband of Cristina (Naomi Watts).  Her husband was killed in a freak accident by Jack (Benicio Del Toro), an ex-con looking for redemption.  As the film shifts back and forth through time, we see the events that lead these people to being united, and it doesn't end well for anyone involved.  The intricate screenplay isn't half as smart as it thinks it is, but the performances from Penn, Watts, and Del Toro are nothing short of brilliant.  Penn's subtle turn is one of his most masterful (he was the only one of the three who weren't nominated for an Oscar for this film, but he took home a Best Actor award for Mystic River the same year), while Watts gives a wonderful and emotional tour de force, and Del Toro is simply brilliant.  Still, 21 Grams attempts to weave an intricate web that isn't as multi-faceted as it thinks it is, but the film still manages to be something special based on the performances of the three leads alone, and they alone are worth seeing the film for.",1128124800,2,1241,4.618181818181818

1987793,4,B0001CNRRU,"Intense performances by Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro, not to mention some fine work by Charlotte Gainsbourg and Melissa Leo, make this almost too much to bear.  Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu throws out a line of tension and keeps it incredibly taunt from beginning to end while exploring the most fundamental human emotions: fear, love, lust, and tragic loss.  He uses a technique being seen more and more in film, a technique in which the story is not told in chronological order, but temporally scattered.  This technique is similar to that used by, for example, Christopher Nolan in Memento (2000) in which the story is told in reverse chronological order.  Here there is a mixed pattern as the story unfolds, sometimes in sequence, sometimes out of sequence.  At first it is disconcerting, then intriguing, and finally everything is abundantly clear.  I don't think this technique is necessary, but it does have the virtue of forcing the viewer to become engaged in trying to figure out what is going on.  And perhaps this heightens the cinematic experience.

There are three stories strung together on a single strand of fate.  First there is the story of Jack Jordan (Del Toro) a petty macho criminal who has found Jesus.  Second there is that of Paul Rivers (Penn), a college professor of mathematics who is dying because of a defective heart.  And third there is that of Cristina Peck (Watts) who has found what she wants in life with a husband she loves and two young daughters.  And then there is the tragic accident that seals their differing fates, and brings horror into their lives.  The story is told in starkly realistic scenes spliced in jarring juxtapositions, skipping from one character's story to the other.  The effect is to give us relief from the terrible events of one part of the story only to lead into another, and then to pull away from that story and into a third until the stories appear as one.

I cannot say enough about the performance of the three leads.  Sean Penn is brilliant in an understated way as he projects (by turns) charm and tenderness, desperation and hope, and a kind of hopelessness headed for a flat line.  Naomi Watts is electrifying in the intensity she brings to the most emotionally-wrought scenes.  She is one of the most amazing actresses working today, and if you haven't seen her, see her here.  You won't forget her.  She was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress (losing out to Charlize Theron in Monster).  And much the same can be said of Benicio Del Toro who was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (losing out to Tim Robbins in Mystic River).  Del Toro's portrayal of a fated man who both found and lost his faith because of tragic events and his own failure of character was totally convincing and very sad.

If I had to nitpick I would say that Cristina's initial feeling that she couldn't be bothered to help prosecute Jack Jordan for killing her family did not square well with her later feeling that she wanted to kill him.  Yet, I suppose, one's feelings can change.  I also didn't think Jordan was the kind of character who would hit and run.  He takes responsibility for his actions.  He turns himself in and says that he has a responsibility to God.

As far as the ending goes, note that Cristina is dressed in bright, almost happy colors because of what was discovered when she donated her type O-positive blood to save Paul's life.  Obviously I can't reveal what was discovered in a review, but I'm willing to bet some people found it redeeming and hopeful while others found it ironic while still others may have found it cheap and easy.  Personally I thought it worked because everything in this movie revolves around very physical human events.

Bottom line: may be too intense for some viewers, and put the kiddies to bed.",1125014400,,3844,4.709580838323354
1987794,5,B0001CNRRU,"Reviewing a fim like 21 Grams, a reviewer finds himself/herself contemplating a dilemma: Will they speak of the impact the film had on them or of the film as an objective work?
Thankfully, this film is so great on either level, that the dilemma does not really have to be there.
As far as impact is concerned, the film (along with ""House of Sand and Fog"") is simply the best I have seen in years. Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu alternates between moving, poetic scenes that most directors would not even dream of creating (which may seem artificial to some but, in my view, really isn't) and fearless brutally true scenes that capture the real horror the characters are facing.
The film has an irregular timeline, which curiously empowers instead of making it annoying.
The real gift, however, this film offers is acting masterclass.
Sean Penn has worked on Paul's character so deeply, that every word he utters feels perfect. Benicio Del Toro, a chameleon like actor creates tremendous emotional weight by simply being in the scene. Naomi Watts is a revelation. She is almost frightening in this film, her every breath seems like an effort not to burst, her every step is bound to send chills down the spine of viewers. Ms. Watts is as great an actress as they come. Period.
The film seems to aim directly to your heart and it is probably going to find its way in. Watching the film makes the audience uncomfortable, and forces them to dive into the dance of life and death, a filmic dance more beautiful and mysterious than we could have ever imagined.",1123459200,3,1551,4.705882352941177
1987795,5,B0001CNRRU,"This is an utterly rivetting film about three lives that intersect by chance.  First, there is the professor (Penn), whose health is deteriorating and whose marriage is all but a meaningless shell.  Second, there is the wife (Watts) of his heart donor, whose pain at the loss of her family has driven her to return to drug abuse.  Third, there is the ex-con who is remaking his life as a born-again christian and is lucky to be loved - he takes responsibility for a car accident that claims the lives of the wife's family.

What makes this film so outstanding is the actors:  they are absolutely first rate and you feel what they are going thru as they question life and try to cope.  It is so utterly believable that it is very painful to watch:  you feel their conflict and the meaninglessness that threatens to engulf each of them, but also how they reach the point where the survivors can go on.  With all of their flaws and the ambiguous outcome, this is not a simplistic hollywood feel-good film where all's well that ends well.  It is brilliant art that reflects on life.  The time shifts are also quite interesting and are not hard to follow as a narrative that is not quite linear.

1987799,5,B0001CNRRU,"I agree with the person who said she couldn't understand how someone would give this a low rating.  If movies are just for entertainment, this is clearly not for you.  But if you want to deal with the human condition, it is. I had to see it twice to appreciate it completely, and of course it takes some endurance to do so.  It had me bawling for days.

I think Arriaga intended some very deep symbolism here.  Sean Penn's character appears to be a ""Christ figure"" in the movie. Towards the end, he grabs a gun and shoots himself while Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro are fighting on the other side of the room.  If he had done what we would normally expect and shot Benicio del Toro, the signs of reconciliation that we can detect near the end of the movie would not have been
possible. He and Christina (Naomi Watts) would have spent the rest of the film running from the law or otherwise trying to hide the fact that they'd killed him, and, I suppose, justifying the act to themselves
because ""he deserved it.""  But as it is, there is room for reconciliation at the end because of what Sean Penn does.

I'll admit that my idea that there's reconciliation might seem doubtful to some of you.  The reason I think there's a bit of reconciliation is that in one of the very last shots of the film, while the narrative
voice-over is on, you see Christina turn to Benicio del Toro while he speaks to her.  I think that in a film like this, written by someone like Guillermo Arriaga, there is reason to read even small details like that in such an optimistic way.  And actually, because the film is giving us what we could call a ""God's-eye view"" of these people's lives, the exact degree of Christina's reconciliation with Benicio del Toro's character is not that important.  What is important is that Arriaga has shown us there is potential for reconciliation.

And as you might guess, I interpret Christina's pregnancy at the end as being a sort of resurrection.  She lost her family, and Sean Penn's love has given her another one. At the very end, you see her in her daughters'
bedroom, cradling her pregnant abdomen and holding one of her daughter's stuffed animals.  Earlier in the film, she had said she could not bear to step into their room.

I also wonder if Arriaga intended Penn's wife to be a sort of representation of Law, given that she's always trying to ""manage"" his life and get him to do sensible things like not smoking.  Much of what she
demands seems sensible, but in the context of his life, it doesn't seem to work.  And you might notice that later, when he attempts to get Christina to stop using drugs, he is more understanding of her position
than his wife had been of his.  What finally gets her to stop using drugs (I assume) is the new life he has given her, rather than someone browbeating her.",1115337600,5,2823,4.446601941747573

This movie is not that bad, but to me it is not that good either.  The main reason I believe that is because Alejandro's other work, Amores Perros, is already about the same thing.  Now, this takes a different approach because Amores Perros has a very Mexican feel (including it's all in Spanish) while 21 Grams is very American, however there is no originality in 21 Grams since it came second.

The sad thing is that people do not realize this because many never checked out Amores Perros, which I highly recommend even if you have seen this film.

The story is very emotional, and the acting is pretty good.  Unfortunately, the method of separating the scenes in non-linear format just didn't work.  It made the movie seem very-choppy, and just didn't flow.  I liked it in the sense that I was using my mind to figure out where each segment fit chronologically, but there was no point in doing this otherwise.

The movie has some very deep, interesting scenes to it.  For example, when her sister flicks her off in the pool this is the same moment when her family is killed.  Very interesting.  I liked this component of the movie.

The few complex scenes and potential excellent-story, just don't make up for the non-fluent, choppy movie.  I was expecting something much better.

And for those reviewers who took the time to explain the structure (convoluted as it is), and point out the amazing and thought-provoking performances in this film - thank you.  I want to share only the thoughts that this film elicited in me after I watched it.

This movie is as perfect a metaphor for life as I have ever seen.  Life, like this movie, is at once confusing and obvious.  We, like the characters so perfectly played here, make choices, then change our minds, sometimes propelled by emotions that seem to control our will.  As death approaches (or slams headlong into our lives), we all question the nature of our existence -past, present, and future.  We isolate ourselves and insinuate ourselves into the lives of others, never really understanding the connections and consequences that are created and destroyed in the process.  And who among us has not had thoughts of revenge, and equally potent thoughts of repentance? Forces throughout our lives turn the simplicity of existence into the web of existential deceit.  Much like the characters in this film, we are caught in that web.  We question our selves and our God, and in the end, life goes on without us.  This is the kind of film that we so rarely see these days.  One that mirrors each of us in some way; and then holds that mirror up for the camera to see.",1103414400,14,1514,4.6716981132075475

Was it groundbreaking or something new?  No.  But was this a really good film that will probably put you through a sad state for a few minutes.  Yes.

I'm not saying that Inarritu ripped Ms Sprecher off, but I'm guessing he must have seen her movie.  And actually, from having watched each film only once (and ""13"" not even all the way from the beginning), I find Jill Sprecher's work more impressive.  Perhaps my expectations were too high for 21 Grams, but I found certain plot pieces strained and pushing the credibility envelope.  Case in point: why would Benecio Del Torro's ""born again"" status not have made him stop and help these people he ran over - if he'd been scared, the director owes us a an account of his state of mind at the time, but there wasn't even an attempt to do this.  The chronological jumping around in 21 Grams was more gimmicky than artistic.  The final scene with the voice over was particularly cloying.  By comparison, 13 Conversations felt much more purposeful and confident.

1987840,4,B0001CNRRU,"_21 Grams_ is another recent testament to the skill of Sean Penn.  What has happened to Penn in the last few years?  Something went off inside of his head and he decided to start really giving it to us, showing us once again that an actor can find himself well into his prime.  Benicio Del Toro is electrifying, as always, in his portrayal of a born-again Christian.  Director Alejandro Inarritu is on his game in this film.  While many have complained about the story's progression, as it flips back and forth out-of-sequence and does not follow a linear plotline, I believe that the story would have suffered without this chaotic format.  From the first few minutes of the film, the audience knows where this train wreck is headed: the gripping part, however, is sitting there in your seat watching as these two storylines are rushing towards one another.  Not only does this type of sequencing keep the audience mentally engaged, it adds to the sense of chaos and unpredictability of the plotline, immersing the viewer inside of this world.  In fact, like many films shot in this manner, if you had seen the film according to the linear timeline, the story would have been somewhat ordinary and boring.

That all being said, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed with _21 Grams_.  Let's put it this way: I love non-linear sequencing, but there are other films out there that do a much better job.  The storyline of this film is a bit too mixed up, with gaps that leave one wondering about motivation on the actor's part.  After the film was over, I just sat there and said, ""All right...it's over now.""  While still an outstanding film, I feel that it fails to hit the mark dead center.

Naomi Watts is brilliant as Christina, an addicted housewife who loses her husband and two daughters in a hit and run accident.

Benicio del Toro gives a fine performance as the driver of the truck, an alcoholic ex-con who is now a born again Christian, trying to reform his life.

Melissa Leo is excellent as his desperate wife, trying to get him to put her and his children first.  A supporting actress nod should have been noticed at the Oscars.

Sean Penn, who was marvelous in MYSTIC RIVER, is even more so in this film, for which he should have received the Oscar.  Maybe he got it because he was so good in both movies.  He plays the infidel college professor who receives Watts' husband's heart and saves his life.  Penn's obsession with finding out his donor's name leads to an involvement with Watts that is both poignant and tragic.

Charlotte Gainsbourg as Penn's wife suffers from a stiff and one tone performance, but fortunately she's not in the movie too much.  A more versatile actress would have added much more.

Watts probably would have won the Best Actress Oscar in a different year; Charlie Theron's MONSTER was such a critically acclaimed crowd pleaser Watts got lost in the shuffle.  But it is a tremendous performance.",1102291200,2,1485,4.799212598425197

Penn plays a dying man in need of a heart transplant whose wife desperately wants a child before he goes.  Watts plays a wife and mom trying to get past her drug addiction and return to a stable life.  Del Toro's story is the most interesting of the three as an ex-con who begins to straighten up his life convinced that Jesus has given him another chance at it.  These three characters all come colliding together in interesting ways, and it is truly a movie that makes you think.  There are some very rough edges of the film, with rough scenes to go along with it, but the film's intention and terrific acting make it one that I want to see again.",1100131200,2,851,4.5359477124183005
1987865,5,B0001CNRRU,"The technique of this film is fascinating. Basically, the 60 or so scenes of this movie are cut & mixed together semi-sequentially, allowing for dozens of flash-forwards & flashbacks. The effort of building the story out of this collage of scenes mentally disarms the audience, so that when the fragments come together into a solid narrative the climax arrives with uncommon power. The final effect was sublime. I was deeply moved.
In terms of philosophy, I think of this plot as a conflict between two paradigms: One is deterministic - that is, you control your destiny. The second - uncertainty - you are buffeted by random events. Most people with careful thought would allow that both models play a part, but if one gets stuck mentally on one track, then the psyche breaks.

As Guillermo Del Toro's character had put his faith in God, and then he'd been destroyed as, in his mind, God had made him the instrument of death. Or Naomi Watt's being in the same mental point, with her family gone, wanting to then close the circle by pursuing revenge. I.E. - Someone was at fault.

But sometimes there is nobody at fault. Events occur without cause or explanation so the circle can never be closed. But we're hard-wired - we have to try to close the circle.

Naomi wants revenge. Guillermo longs for death as punishment, or is broken in a meaningless existence he cannot understand. Their psychic pain is palpable

This dichotomy is at the heart of the human condition - we can understand chance, or luck, but we cannot mentally accept our complete helplessness.. If we do, other issues begin to surface. What is the meaning of our lives? Is there any, if G-d is so far away and so uncaring? This worldview, the secular Darwinist one, is deeply disquieting and uncomfortable and very few can stomach it for long periods.

The mind produces tricks to avoid these kinds of issues. The Biblical response is the Story of Job - I.E. God works in mysterious ways. I never bought it, but I don't live in a religious worldview anyway. I understand the need. So be it.

Maybe I'm just reading my thoughts into this. These are rich themes and I know I'm just scratching the surface. This is definately worthwhile for fans of existential drama.  The waters here run deep.",1099958400,3,2259,4.6893939393939394
1987866,3,B0001CNRRU,"This movie can easily confuse the heck out of anyone... It takes a while to pick up the storyline, and even once you do figure out how the lives of Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn and Naomi Watt get connected (much in the same style as in the director's outstanding movie, ""Amores Perros""), there are still ends that are not easy to tie until later... much later. By the end of the movie it becomes somewhat evident that the core of the story is about how the protagonists deal with their own guilts and internal demons.

As much as I loved the cinematography, the performances of the three leads and the overall feel of the movie (much assisted too by Gustavo Santaolalla's magical musical touch), and as much as I am into non-linear filmmaking, after a while you get a bit tired of the jumping back and forth. Specially since it doesn't build up in a way that is compelling enough and ends up taking away from the core message. You feel before the movie is half way through that there's no good reason for resorting to telling the story in this way, or that the editing work was not effective enough.

All in all, a good movie, but far from ""Amores Perros"", Irritu's cinematic accomplishment to date. I give it three stars mostly for the performances and the movie's overall feel.

Maybe some people find this entertaining but I didn't think there was anything this movie had to say.

1987868,2,B0001CNRRU,"After seeing Amores Perros, I jumped at the chance to see 21 Grams, but it lacks the depth of its predecessor.

Since other reviews synopsis the movie, I'll skip that and move right into how it fails.

First of all, the 21 grams have nothing to do with the movie and are so vague that the viewer doesn't know what the heck they are supposed to be or mean.  I felt that it was tacked onto the end to add some desperatly missing depth.

Second, the nonlinear storytelling that made Amores Perros a gem is just confusing and muddled in 21 Grams.  The movie starts at the middle-end and jumps around so much that it has the feel of a Memento-wannabe rather than an original film.  The fragmentation of scenes deflate any building suspense or wonder.  All the scenes seem to just build up to the graphic sex scene between Penn and Watts.  Though I knew it was coming, I felt cheated that a movie with so much potential debased itself to peaking during a sex scene.  It smacks of laziness.

It's my opinion that the film lacked intensity as a linear plot so the director mixed scenes up to give the illusion of art.

Despite the film's failures, the acting is superb.  I especially liked Del Toro's character who plays an ex-con Christian who is struggling with himself and his new faith.

Overall, it's not a bad movie, but there are much better films out there that master the fragmented storyline like Amores Perros and Memento.  Do yourself a favor and watch those instead.",1098489600,8,1471,4.50188679245283

1987891,3,B0001CNRRU,"It takes about 5 minutes to figure out that this is not an ordinary film.  About 7 minutes to figure out that the editing is disjunctive and the chronology of the story is jumbled.  About 20 minutes to get a proper feel for the movie and figure out what is going on.  And then a further couple of days to digest the whole thing properly and figure out if it was actually any good or if it was all just a gimmick.

Where I've settled is that this is a very good film - it might not pull off everything it sets out to achieve - but it is a very good film nevertheless.

When I first started watching I was intrigued and curious - why was the editing done this way?  Initially I thought that it distracted the viewer from the story and hid the fact that it was an average film.  Now I'm of the view that the broken chronology / jumbled editing adds something to the movie watching experience (but I wouldn't want every film to be done this way).

Leaving the weird editing to one side for a moment, there is a lot that I liked about this film - the performances are outstanding (Naomi Watts in particularly is superb); the cinematography beautiful (washed out and gloomy); and the themes are very real and human (dependency; reinvention of self; revenge).

At first the jumbled story line is a bit bewildering - it isn't told backwards like Memento, it's a little bit more all over the place.  The initial scenes introduce the main characters in the movie but from different points in the story.  We meet Paul (Sean Penn) who is sick and waiting for a heart transplant / donating sperm / getting beat up (and we aren't sure what the proper order is).  We also meet Christina (Naomi Watts) in bed with Paul / coking up in a bathroom / with, what appears to be, her husband and children (again we have no idea of the correct chronology).  And finally we meet Jack (Benito Del Toro) who is being fired from his job at a country club / in jail / working with kids at an inner city church.

It's all a bit confusing, but it works.  Slowly you are able to sort the jumble out, come to know the characters a little and then, finally, learn the context in which their lives have been thrown together.  The unconventional chronology certainly involves the viewer in the story.  You have to pay attention and piece the thing together in your head.

But then we get back to the editing - does it add to the story or is it a gimmick and a decoy for a story line that isn't quite there?

As I said, I think it adds to the story.  The film is (in part) about the strange and random ways in which we meet people.  Sometimes weird stuff has to happen before somebody comes into your life.  And the editing draws this out in emphasising the randomness of life - albeit in a William Burrows kind of way.  And hey, life's a bit of a puzzle anyway isn't it?

Having said that, I think you'll find that it is a pretty common critique to say that the editing distracts from the story and that if the film were told in a traditional chronological way that it would lose some of its impact.  I think that's true and that's why I think it's fair to say that the film is perhaps a bit too ambitious.

But I liked it anyway.",1097625600,4,3194,4.23801652892562
1987892,3,B0001CNRRU,"21 Grams is a film of undeniable artistry and fine performances.  It also makes for very uncomfortable viewing.  The non-sequential nature didn't bother me (and I don't really buy the comparisons to Memento, this film is more jumbled up than 'backwards').  The problem for me was the lack of hope.  Surely all of us fear that phone call, that accident, that illness that will strike one of us down.  God knows, I've thought about it - but I don't necessarily want to live it vicariously.  Love doesn't save the characters, faith deserts them, repentence and good deeds go unrewarded...realistic, yes, but too much so.
I never thought I would long for a sappy Hollywood ending, but this movie provoked just such a reaction.  I also had a minor quibble with the plot (why was the Naomi Watts character so forgiving, then so vengeful?).

I don't mean this in a bad way, but when a film can change the way that i was feeling during that day, then it is really something special, and ""21 Grams"" ruined my day when i saw it. At first I was tossed around with the storyline and the plot, finding myself looking at the movie box countless times to get an idea of what was going on, but the way that the film ran was truly different, and effective. Great performances from some of the most underrated actors and actresses in the business today truly hoisted this film to a higher level. Sean Penn, who is one of my guilty favs as an actor, I've loved him ever since ""Falcon and The Snowman"", was truly brillant and full of life in front of the camera. Naomi Watts, whom is also a good friend of Nicole Kidman's, is actually a lot more enjoyable to watch in film to me than Kidman. Watts was dead on and to me, the performance that really took this film over the top. She was magnificant as the drug-addled mother of a recently deceased family. I felt her pain through the entire film, and she was startling in every frame that she was in. I felt her anguish, her hostility, her guilt, every emotion talked to me throughout the film. As for Del Toro, once again a tour de force performance as the ex-con that was trying to get his life together until he killed Watts' family. The only downside to the film was that it kind of dragged in places, and the chronology was rather difficult to follow, as was mentioned earlier.

The chopped-up editing is somewhat more difficult to follow than that of Amores Perros, but it's far from impossible if you're actually trying to figure out.

21 Grams isn't light cinema. But most truly great films aren't great just because of their value as diversions. Anyone who's seen a Kubrick film knows that the director wasn't always concerned merely with entertaining his viewer. 21 Grams is frustrating, but it is the work of a group of artists (Inarritu, Penn, del Toro, Watts) at the peak of their form.",1096329600,5,682,4.879310344827586
1987895,3,B0001CNRRU,"I have mixed feelings about 21 Grams. On the one hand, it's wonderfully well-acted. This is basically a three-person movie. Yes, there are supporting characters, but the film truly belongs, heart and soul, to the people played by Naomi Watts, Sean Penn, and Benicio Del Toro. And they all do pretty freakin' phenomenal jobs of bringing these people to life. Without giving away too much of the plot (I'm sure others will be more than happy to do that), these three lives are brought together by a single moment of horror, and the bulk of the movie recounts how they deal with its aftermath.

Problems with 21 Grams: All the main characters have enough negative traits (drug addiction, serial infidelity, religious mania, etc.) they're just not particularly pleasant people to visit. The movie itself is a downer. And, while the events taking place on-screen are quite interesting, the film is told out of sequence - severely. It hops back in forth in time like a Mexican jumping bean. Many will posit this is due to the influence, and popularity, of Quentin Tarantino's work. The difference is that Tarantino's movies, for all his chronology games, are quite easy to follow. That is not the case in 21 Grams. And often, there's simply no reason for the time splits. I mean, really, do we need to wait over an hour to know the reason the Watts character was laughing was that her sister was flipping her a bird behind her back? After watching this movie I was left with the feeling it would have been a much more interesting - and certainly more intelligible - film if it had simply been told in straightforward chronology.

I'm glad I saw 21 Grams, for the performances of Watts, Penn and Del Toro which were all frankly sensational. On the other hand, the movie left me depressed, and the film editing was irritating as hell.",1096156800,,1826,4.703125

I thought that made the movie more interesting and appealing because it's something different and fresh.  The acting was great and the story line raw.  Go see this and I know you'll enjoy it.  If you are a Sean Penn fan, then this is definately for you because lately he's so good in everything he's done and this was no exception.",1095465600,2,408,4.4
1987898,3,B0001CNRRU,"There a little less here than meets the eye.

The structure and the performances are engaging, and certain scenes are moving, but when you put the shattered pieces together, the whole isn't quite right.  If this story was told

chronologically the holes in the character development would be more obvious, but they are obvious enough as is. We simply don't see the transition in any of the main characters.  Where they start and where they end up are buyable places, and so too are a few of the places along the way, but none of it is has been connected well enough for us to follow them. This is one of those films that causes you to become more and more aware of the writer and director as you watch it, which costs you your suspicion of disbelief; you become aware the people are manipulating characters and plot points in order to explore various themes, but it gets to feeling increasingly forced.  The meditation it seems to want to have made on death implied by the voice over questions that end the film really hasn't been explored, either.  People die and babies are made but the film really has nothing to say about birth or death, or even much about life.

It not only seems to be inspired by Heart, a little known European film that is much better (sharper, cleaner, more believable, and ultimately much more emmotinally disturbing) , but it seems to steal outright from it.",1094860800,,1386,4.564516129032258
1987899,4,B0001CNRRU,"This film is edgy and incredibly imperfect, it bounces around in time and begins where it ends but there is a method to the madness.

In every life a stranger's actions may reflect our future at any given moment and this film brings together three lives and three families as no other. It begins with the ending, an unexplained moment that makes no sense and seems entirely insignificant until the end. We find a cynical almost self-loathing man in need of an organ transplant, he sits alone in a room waiting to die or be given life through another's death. Another core character is a busy mom who bakes a cake with her girls but hides her deepest secrets from her family. The driving force in the film is an ex-con who covers his anger by representing a born again Christian to the outside world. The film takes these main characters and twists and turns back and forth through time revealing the past and presenting glimpses of the future as it rolls slowly along. It is difficult to get through but worth the effort once all of the scenes are eventually tied together.

The actors in this film deserved more attention for their roles. Sean Penn is the ailing professor and puts his all into the struggle of this man's life. Penn is perfect as the seriously conflicted man managing to always be flawless in such challenging roles. Naomi Watts is the seemingly happy young mother but soon changes face as tragedy disrupts her protected world and Watts decays into a different character. Watts is brilliant next to Penn and is not even close to suffocating in his turmoil; she brings her own agony right back and does it extremely well. Finally Benecio Del Toro is superb as the flawed ex-con trying to control his future by a false faith. Del Toro is anguish! He always brings something extra to his roles. Adding to the fantastic acting of these individuals is the way that the director filmed this movie. The actors are filmed in a gritty light that sticks in each and every facial imperfection and traces the tragedy of their lives. The actor's skin is sallow and almost gray, with dark circles under their eyes and grimy fingernails clasping cigarettes in most of the scenes. If you are looking for pretty this isn't it! But the filmmakers deepen the tragedy of the characters with this unique technique somehow.

The message that extends from this gritty film is that our lives intersect with many others through a series of events and that one bad decision can off shoot into a million others. With all of the people we pass by unconsciously everyday it may make you wary or it may make you aware of the impact your life has in the world. The message is clear and the writer/director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, has managed to convey his worth to the world in an amazingly unique and profound way. The weight of this film is more than a few grams and Inarrito has carved himself a brilliant future.",1094601600,3,2909,4.6228239845261125
1987910,5,B0001CNRRU,"To descibe a film as being truly original is thrown around so often but in the case of ""21 Grams"" it totally applies.  Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a new talent to be reckoned with.  The structure and editing of this film is so unique that it takes your breath away.  It's like fragments of a whole that seem to be random but come together at the end for a satisfying conclusion.  Inarritu takes three disparate individuals whose lives couldn't be so different who, through circumstance and tragedy,intersect.  The acting in this film by the three principles is top-notch.  I thought Sean Penn as the heart transplant recipient gave a better performance here than he did in ""Mystic River"" in which he won the Oscar.  Naomi Watts continues the stellar work that started with ""Mullholland Drive"" as the grieving widow.  I save my highest praise for Benicio Del Toro who continues to amaze with his portrayal of the ex-con who finds Jesus.

1987911,5,B0001CNRRU,"The mathematical professor Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is dying as his heart is slowly deteriorating and the only thing that can save him would be a heart transplant.  Meanwhile, Paul's wife is urging him to impregnate her as she wishes for a child with her husband, which brings up some moral dilemmas for the couple.  The rich housewife Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a recovering cocaine addict with a wonderful family that she loves above all as she fills her days with rehab meetings and swimming.  The family man, ex-convict, and former alcoholic Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) has discovered God and works hard to mend his past failures in the name of the Lord by helping others.  Paul, Christina, and Jack meet at a crossroad that brings them all pain, suffering, and agony as guilt, love, and anger are heavy burdens in their hearts.

Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, the man behind the film Amores Perros (2000), brings another riveting tale of three characters whose lives are interconnected and ultimately changed through an dreadful accident.  The film offers the audience reflection upon the grief caused by several emotional states such as love, anger, and guilt, which follows the accident.  Despite the similarities in 21 Grams and Amores Perros, Irritu rejuvenates the idea and displays outstanding directorial skills as he offers the audience an innovative cinematic experience.

21 Grams is told in a fragmented storyline which encourages the audience to ponder the theme and messages of the film.  This fragmented storyline displays first-class editing as it, at an initial glance, seems erratic and difficult to follow, but as the storyline jumps back and forth it offers small glimpses of recollection that encourages thoughtful interaction with the film.  The cinematography, mise-en-scene, and editing are outstanding as they elevate the emotional turmoil that the characters are experiencing.  All the cinematic aspects of making a film are brought together by Irritu and he offers the world a brilliant cinematic experience.",1093996800,,2040,5.246153846153846

In a film like THE ENGLISH PATIENT (another non-linear storyline), the filmmakers gave you enough time to get involved with the plight of the characters.  In 21 GRAMS, the cuts are so abrupt and frequent that you never get a chance to really bond with the characters.

Instead of feeling their pain, you're left saying, ""Oh, that's how that fits together.""

But the three actors here are among the best acting in film today, so it's definitely worth seeing for that.",1093996800,2,684,4.714285714285714
1987913,3,B0001CNRRU,"see this one for the performances, for they are all white hot.  My biggest problem with this film is character development, a consequence, perhaps, of the director's editing format.  We are thrown into emotionally intense scenes before we have a chance to actually ""care"" about these characters.  It's not until many minutes into this film that some sort of (limited) cohesion and development is apparent. The scenes are powerful but they have no emotional resonance, no precedent to make an impression. Watts gives a stellar, though somewhat uneven performance here.  Her scenes are ""very"" dramatic, but her image to me is never that of a truly ""broken"" woman.  Penn's performance is on par, but he was more believable in ""Mystic River"". His acting is good but he doesn't embody the role of a mathematician.  Toro's performance saves this film from becoming a self-indulgent quagmire.  His character, it seems, makes the biggest journey, and he inhabits his role with a quiet intensity.  He is the character that you feel for as the story develops.  It's his resolution that gives the film the weight and impact it has.  From a purely emotional view, i compare this film to ""The house of sand and fog""  and i find it lacking.  I like to be affected emotionally when i watch these types of films.  I like to be overwhelmed with an intense empathic response.  I also enjoy becoming absorbed into the characters and living the drama myself.  I didn't feel nearly as much emotion for the characters in 21 grams.  Yes the film is tragic, but because of the editing used, you never get to see these characters disintegrate in a tragic way.  I viewed both of these films back-to-back and 21 grams had the least impact of the two.  The performances though, as i mentioned, are first-rate and the movie has a message which is worth viewing.",1093737600,4,1832,4.780254777070064

The movie follows three different plot lines that end up meeting at dramatic points to create one awesome, twisted plot.  Also, the movie jumps around it's timeline a lot to show you the different plot points at the right times.  Genius.

The acting is fantastic, and the movie's theme remains dark and chaotic.

Be warned, however, you will have to pay attention to this one, or you will be completely lost.  The first ten or 15 minutes of this movie will make absolutely no sense, so stick with it, and everything will unfold magically in front of you.",1093392000,,715,4.496124031007752
1987915,5,B0001CNRRU,"Alejandro Inarritu,'s ""21 Grams"" is one of the best films of the year. During this movie, I was so completely engrossed in what was ocurring on screen that I never left my chair. They are only two other movies that have had that type of effect on me. ""21 Grams"" is an intimate meditation on life and death, love and vengeance, directed with intelligence and grace by Inarritu. It also boasts some of the best film acting you'll ever see in one movie.

""21 Grams"" is a story told in fragments, and is for the most part not in chronocological order. It tells the tale of three individuals, whose fates are somehow inextricably linked. But how? For almost the entire film, Inarritu keeps you guessing about what brings these three people into the same room together, and that is one reason why ""21 Grams"" is so effective. It forces you to get involved in the film, investing deeply into the story and the characters.

The second reason to see ""21 Grams"" is the acting. Sean Penn excels at playing a faithless college professor who is dying and needs a heart transplant. Naomi Watts would have won an Oscar for her performance as a drug-addicted, griefstricken widow if it hadn't been for Charlize Theron's revelatory work in ""Monster."" Watts builds upon the promise of ""Mulholland Drive,"" crafting a portrait of almost unbearable intensity. After her husband and two young children are killed in a car accident, Watts falls apart, screaming ""I am an amputee, can't you see that! I cannot just go on with my life!"" She will blow you away. Benecio Del Toro is also outstanding in his portrayal of a born-again ex-convict. He plays a broken-down man, and it shows in the way he carries his body.

Excellent supporting performances are given by Melissa Leo and Charlotte Gainsborough as the wives of Del Toro and Penn. Leo in particular is devestating as she tries to cover up for her husband's crimes. ""21 Grams"" also features exquisite cinematography. It really is breathtakingly beautiful, especially the very first shot of Sean Penn and Naomi Watts.

I highly recommend ""21 Grams."" It is a brilliantly conceived film, featuring skilled direction and explosive acting from all involved. Not a big moneymaker on its initial release, hopefully now it will find the audience it richly deserves.",1093219200,4,2287,4.826530612244898
1987916,5,B0001CNRRU,"21 Grams is a tense, gripping, and disturbing film full of twists and surprises. The story is better left in summary:  A freak accident brings together a critically ill mathematician (Sean Penn), a grieving mother (Naomi Watts) and a born-again ex-con (Benincio Del Toro). In itself, it provides an upfront guarantee of satisfaction and weaves a spellbinding and suspenseful mystery. However, after throwing in its credited cast and their flawless performances, you get one of the most powerful films of the year. The wonderful Sean Penn leads the all-star cast, who all deliver possibly the finest performances of their careers. Guillermo Arriaga writes this intelligent story with the intent to captivate his audience, which he does, and at the same time touch them, which he also does. The film is greatly benefited from the award-nominated acting and the superb direction. Though the film blasts back and forth from past to present, by the movie's end every scene has been tied to the next leaving no questions -- nothing but a speechless audience. 21 Grams is a profound piece of cinematic art and is highly recommended.

1987917,5,B0001CNRRU,"This movie is on the most well-done movie I have ever seen with breatless cinematography. It was very intense at many parts and is very unique. It focuses on the lives of 3 people. The first person, Jack Jordon (Benicio Del Toro) is a preacher who has been in and out of jail many times. He leads a poor life with his wife and 2 kids.

After the accident, Jack goes to jail and he questions whether there is a god and why God made him run over the family and then leave the scene.

The acting is some of the most engrossing performances i have seen to date.

Naomi Watts shreds the screen to pieces with her ferocious turn as a drug-addicted widow with a grudge to bare, and continues to prove that her performance in Mullholland Drive was no fluke.

Sean Penn dazzles us once again with a truly gritty and emotionally draining effort as the ailing Math Professor who recieves a 2nd chance at life.

But it is Benicio Del Toro's under-rated transformation into the ex-convict, who finds God, only to question his own faith and morals that really stays in your mind long after this cut and paste account of 3 interweaving lives is over.

1987939,1,B0001CNRRU,"This film has a rather unique plot arrangement with strong acting but all converge upon a non-existant theme. After a rather depressive two hours of drama, the audience is left wondering as to what the point of the story was.

  Benicio Del Torro delivers a moving performance as a penitent ex-con who seeks redemption as a born again Christian. His conscience tormented between his duty to God, family, and society. Sean Penn seeks the wife of his heart donor to give his thanks but soon finds himself evoking painful memories and mixed emotions from the grieving widow. In turn, Sean Penn feels compelled to avenge the death of the widow's family by killing Benicio Del Torro.

  At best, the film's theme shows that there is no simple truth to spiritual salvation in the bleak drama of human lives. The film shows that God punishes the innocent, the penitent, as well as true sinners and that none of us will ever really know why. Given the dramatic ending of Sean Penn's character, the film seeks to show that life is short and that we should be thankful for being healthy and alive, even if for a brief time. If that is indeed the film's message, it conveys it rather obscurely and unsuccessfully.

  If you have to see this film, see it on video. There's nothing about this film that makes it worth seeing at the movie theater for $9; you also won't have to find yourself in an embarrassing situation if you fall asleep. Another advantage of seeing it on video is that you can pause it and try to study its elusive, if even present, convoluted theme.",1090540800,4,1556,4.588447653429603
1987940,4,B0001CNRRU,"You may not like the film itself, but you must admit the actors' talent -- Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, Benicio Del Toro are all fantastic.  The story, meldrmatatic as it is, is not a problem.  The real problem is, you may not be absorbed in the way it is told.
See the characters first.  Christina (Naomi Watts) is a mother of two daughters, married to a loving husband.  Tragic accident happens to them (that you will see soon), and Chris can be what she was any longer.
The accident was caused by one man Jack (Del Toro), a devoted believer of one sect of religion, and he was also doing time in prison before becoming a fervent member.  Jack is also a father of two kids, and one of them knows what the father did.
Christina's tragedy brings another man onto the stage -- Paul (Penn).  We know he was going to die -- because of his heart -- but Christina's husband gives another life to him.  However, Paul is still unhappy, as if he lost something (perhaps when he should be happy before his wife)  And he meets Chris, the one he should never meet.  After that, everything starts to rush lie a Greek tragedy.
All these ingredients can be told in the traditional storytelling scheme.  The dirctor (of ""Amores Perros"") strongly refuses that linear narrative, and he gives a very experimental approach to the material --so unique that you should be very attentive to what is going on the screen.
THE FILM'S STORY IS BROKEN into pieces, and they, regardless of chronological order, are all again pieced together, as if hesitating to reveal the whole truth.  Thanks to the taut editing and fast pace, you will not lose interest in what happened to these characters to the end, at which the film shows what really happened to them.
And what happened?  They turn out so convoluted that you might accuse the director of being too intent on giving one or two too many surprise to us.  In fact, though the film's first half is gripping, the second half gets a little dull, for by then we come to realize what is the reality behind these fragmentary scenes.  The director tries to outwit us, but the last action of the film is, frankly speaking, preposterous.
Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu certainly believes in the power of film as media, and he is good at presenting his story, too.  I know he wants to say something -- something about the still undying power of cinema -- sacrificing the accessible narrative method.  But you see a dying person, and then see the same person alive and kicking, we find it somewhat disturbing and even pretentious.  Why does he go experimental when you get a better way of telling that, in this case, chronological order?

1987943,5,B0001CNRRU,"""21 Grams"" is a gut-twisting, throat-grabbing, and disturbingly powerful film. Not in a long time has such a film challenged an audience to think about what they have just seen. It raises many questions, but that doesn't mean that it leaves the audience unsatisfied. It is certainly one of the best films I have seen all year long-or ever.
The film has many characters, but it pictures Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts), an ex-drug addict turned housewife and mother. She has two wonderful daughters and a kind husband. To remain motivated in life, she swims with her sister Claudia (Clea DuVall) and stays in shape. Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is a mathematics professor who has a fatal heart problem and needs a new, donated heart soon or he will die. His wife Mary (Charlotte Gainsbourg) desperately wants a child but cannot conceive, and will go to the extremes of artificial insemination to have a family. However, Paul does not agree with this idea. Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) is a spiritual ex-convict who preaches to prisoners in hopes of improving life and staying clean. Marianne (Melissa Leo), his wife, has grown weary of insistently going to church and is upset with his poor parenting skills for their two children. Meanwhile, Cristina's world closes in on her when tragedy strikes and she descends back into drugs and depression. The lives of these three people become intertwined and the audience knows that something terrible is going to happen because the film opens with Cristina screaming in a motel as Paul bleeds and Jack is frozen in place, listening to Cristina's pleading.
""21"" is not a film in chronological order. It is, in fact, a film where the ending is shown at the beginning and the characters often know more than the audience, or visa versa. Little details and clues are fed to the viewer as the film progresses and crashes in a stunning finale. The title refers to the supposed weight that everyone loses at the exact moment of death. This is not a misleading title because this is a very dark, grainy, gritty, and upsetting drama. The disturbing images are subtle, and the fabulous photography helps capture what is going on so clearly. Everything is very dark and dim, and the camera is constantly shaking to get a feel for the lives of the characters. The editing is deserving of an Academy Award because it doesn't confuse the audience too much-it just doesn't give them everything they want right in the beginning.
The performances are all Oscar caliber in genius Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's tour de force. Sean Penn is pitch-perfect, but his character touches familiar ground as in ""Mystic River."" Benicio Del Toro is fantastic as a very disturbed but honest man. Charlotte Gainsbourg and Melissa Leo both are solid as the wives of the main characters, and at many times, the audience really hates both these women for being so selfish-if a film can do that, then the screenwriter and director have both done their job. However, it is Naomi Watts that really makes ""21 Grams."" Her performance is so captivating that you can't take your eyes off the screen. She will certainly come out of the Hollywood darkness in this one, making herself a well-known and more respected actress. She deserves an Academy Award because Naomi plays another character that you really want to hate and scream at. She is that good! All of the players are at the top of their game.
If you can sit through darkness, drugs, and depression, this is a great movie with a lot to offer and a shocker of an ending. All the performances are perfect, and the technical production of the film is first rate. ""21 Grams"" arrives at number 2 on my list of 2003 great films, and deserves all of its acclaim.",1089504000,5,3707,4.775700934579439

1987945,2,B0001CNRRU,"21 Grams is a very dramatic movie. The story is not told in order but jumps forward and backward through time, which can be a little confusing. Sean Penn plays a terminally ill man who has less than a month to live when he recieves a heart from an organ donor. The donor along with his two daughters was hit by a born again Chritian ex-convict. Penn finds his donor's wife and has an affair with her as she grieves for her dead husband. There really wasn't much to this movie. It was very slow and only slightly interesting. The  movie spends a lot of time establishing the background stories of the characters. It shows Sean Penn's character in the hospital, and with his wife as they try to get pregnant. She has to get a surgery to be artificially inseminated because of a botched abortion she had a while ago. When he learns of the abortion they fight and he seeks out his donor's wife. A private investigator leads him to her and they eventually sleep together. The donor's wife becomes depressed after her family's death and experiments with drugs before and while having the affair. The born again, who is a husband and father, has a long prison record before his hit and run, which he turns himself in for. You really have to like dramas to enjoy this movie.

1987946,5,B0001CNRRU,"I had heard so many good things about this movie that I finally had to watch it.  For the first 20 minutes, I had a hard time getting into it as it made absolutely no sense.  Every scene contained different characters doing something disconnected from what had happened before.  I almost turned it off out of boredom.  But I am so glad I didn't!
Something extraordinary happened about a third of the way into the film, once the three main characters-- Penn, Watts, and del Toro-- had been in several scenes and I started actually getting into each of their respective storylines.  Some of the things I enjoyed were Watts' performance, which had me in tears several times throughout the film, and the irony in some spots of the tragedy in one person's story juxtaposed next to a quick cutaway to humor in another person's story.  I found myself intrigued with the way the story was told.  The non-linear plot made it so much more haunting once I actually realized what was actually going on and was able to put it together.
To summarize, I thought this was one of the most heartbreaking but strangely beautiful movies I've seen in a long time.  I highly recommend it if you want something different and experimental.",1089244800,3,1215,4.644859813084112
1987947,5,B0001CNRRU,"21 Grams is based on the quasi-theological calculation that at the moment of death, the human body loses exactly 21 grams of weight, and that is said to be the weight of the soul.
Sean Penn (not to downplay the stellar performances of Benecio Del Toro and Naomi Watts) plays maybe the role of his life as a dying man in desperate need of a heart transplant. Del Toro plays a criminal who has found his salvation in a literal and scary interpretation of Scripture, the love of a good woman, and his 2 children. Watts plays a woman with a sketchy past who has come out on top, married a great guy, and given birth to 2 lovely little girls. Their lives intersect around a tragedy, and high art/high drama are the result when the three of them meet.
Filmed in the fragmented, flashback within flashback style of Pulp Fiction, you have to keep watching on pure faith that it'll all make sense eventually - and it does, oh boy, it does.

The plot is all twisted and keeps you on the edge of your seat,the acting is brilliant by the entire cast, and the end results are truly riveting. By the time everything wrapped up,I had a knot in my stomach, and my heart was pounding. And I mean that in the best way possible. Do NOT miss this moving,gritty,raw+real gem filled with some truly explosive scenes of wrenchingly intense acting.",1088640000,6,527,4.67741935483871
1987956,5,B0001CNRRU,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has made a bold film in an innovative style.  The movie is not told in a straightforward fashion.  There are approximately 40-50 scenes, and they are assembled in a non-linear fashion.  It's sort of the cinematic equivalent of tossing 50 pieces of a puzzle onto a table and having to mentally assemble them.

For me, it works.  I have read other reviews that weren't that crazy about it.  Roger Ebert wrote that the technique got in the way of the story.  Other reviewers here have complained either that it made the story ""slow"" or boring or that they just didn't get it.

I'd have to see the whole film reassembled into chronological order to be able to give an opinion about whether or not the film is better in its presented form or whether it would be improved by being more conventional, but I didn't have any trouble sorting out the various plot-lines in my head as the story unfolded.

Sean Penn gives another memorable performance as a math professor with a congenitally bad heart.  We learn that he is less than a month from death unless he gets a transplant.  Naomi Watts gives the best performance I've seen yet from this talented actress as a woman who is happily married to an architect with whom she shares two daughters, but we also see that in her past she did more than dabble in drugs.  Benicio Del Toro is heartbreakingly good as a man who has lived a hard life and done some hard time before being saved, in the Christian sense. Melissa Leo is his wife, and she shared his hard life before, and plainly hasn't come to terms yet with his conversion as a born-again Christian.  All of the main characters intersect in ways that I cannot reveal without spoiling, so I won't.

There are many other supporting performances given by actors who I was not familiar with, and my lack of recognition contributed to my ability to fall into the story.  The film brings up many difficult questions, and I think it is one of it's strengths that it does not find easy answers to them.

It's a worthwhile way to spend 2 hours if you want to see strong acting, bravura film-making, and don't mind having to think about what's on the screen.",1088553600,4,2172,4.530769230769231
1987957,2,B0001CNRRU,"The director chose to tell this story in non-linear form.  To me, watching the scenes out-of-sequence often felt as frustrating as trying to find a word in a dictionary that wasn't alphabetized correctly.  The backwards technique worked in ""Memento"" because it fit the circumstances of the plot, but in ""21 Grams"" it seemed like a gimmick and interfered with my enjoyment of the film.  Just to make things worse, this movie has an over-written plot that would be complicated even if told in a straightforward way.
There are a number of sub-plots, some of which are central to the main story and others which seem disconnected from the movie as a whole.  The best example of the latter is the ""artificial insemination"" plotline which has Sean Penn's mate wanting his baby but being unable to get her tubes untied and healed before he is expected to die from a bad heart. Penn acts like such a jerk to her, I had no idea why she insisted on having his child.  Aside from that, the whole, heavily-contrived idea went nowhere and added nothing to the film.  By the way, do they really show porn videos in fertility clinics to assist the male donor in delivering the goods?  On second thought, don't tell me even if you know.
On the plus side, there seems to be no movie that can't be improved by the addition of Naomi Watts.  Not only is she a terrific actress, she's intensely sexy no matter how hard they try to make her look tired, doped-up, and washed out.  And, wow, does she know how to do passionate kissing scenes.
Many of the parts seem miscast.  In particular, Sean Penn as a mathematician just doesn't work for me.  British actress Charlotte Gainsbourg, as Penn's wife, is a young Jacqueline Bissett who seems to have wandered off the set of Wuthering Heights.  The film bears the weaknesses of an ""internationalized"" director who has a bad ear for American dialog, how it should it be delivered, and the casting choices necessary to make sure it gets spoken by the right actors.
I'm sorry to go against the crowd on this one, but I simply think the whole thing was an overwrought, disjointed mess masquerading as artful cinema.",1087689600,4,2135,4.63395225464191
1987958,5,B0001CNRRU,"This movie is only 2 hours long, but being so fragmented in deliverance it sometimes seems like it goes on forever. I didn't mind it the first time, but when showing my friends movies I start to worry about them getting bored or ""not getting"" the whole message. Regardless, the title of this movie had many people I know thinking it was about drugs. Drugs are only vaguely mentioned. The 21 grams in question is the weight of a hummingbird, a stack of quarters, and the weight a human body loses just as they die. The theory is that the soul is the item lost. This film is so compelling to me that it's made its way to my top 10 list, and that's a difficult feat anymore. I cannot even think of a movie to relate this to, since it stands on its own simple plot laced with fantastic acting, awe-inspiring direction, and a powerful mess of film editing. Maybe ""Memento"" because of the here-it-is-live-with-it method of drama, as well as the reverse sequence of events. ""21 Grams"" avoids any melodrama and cheap sappy shots, something the director could have easily dwelled on. The fragmented editing takes away any cliche's but still provides a powerful impact in the pit of my stomach. Any way, Jesus gave me this dvd.",1087603200,2,1217,4.536363636363636
1987959,4,B0001CNRRU,"This film has several good things going for it.  First, it has a good story.  Second, it has really fine actors.  Third, it has a director who has made a name for himself with cutting edge techniques.  Put them all together and ...  well ... maybe it works for some people.  It only occasionally worked for me.  It was the ""cutting edge techniques"" part that played around with the time frame of events that I found difficult to enjoy.

Even though Benico Del Toro had third billing, he stole the show.  All the roles were difficult and complex, but his was probably the most challenging.  He plays a ex-con who, when we first meet him, is now a church-going religious fanatic.  He's changed his life and preaches the word of Jesus to everyone he meets.  Sometimes he goes a little too far - like when his children are fighting and he makes his daughter allow his son to punch her again because he literally believes in the ""turn the other cheek"" philosophy - but we can all see he is trying to go straight and lead a good life.  His wife, played by Melissa Leo is also great.  She plays the part of a woman who has stuck by her man through all the bad times and now is trying desperately to support his religious streak and keep him out of jail.

Seam Penn plays the role of a dying man whose wife wants to have a baby. And Naomi Watts plays the role of a young widow who is going through severe depression when her family is killed in an accident.

A series of seemingly unrelated events brings all of these people's lives together.  The result is high drama.

The director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, seems to have shot the film, cut it all to pieces, and let the audience see it a little at a time, and not at all in sequence.  Little by little details were revealed that was supposed to flesh out the story.  Well, sometimes they did and sometimes they didn't.  All I knew is that I kept wishing the director would ""get on with it"".  And since I had the luxury of watching the film on DVD and not in a theater, I was able to walk away from the screen and do stuff on my computer without having to concentrate too hard on the film as it just was taking too long to say something that had been already told before.  Basically, by the time I had watched half the film, there were no more surprises, and I just didn't care.

Film buffs should see 21 Grams and, for that reason I'm glad I saw it.  As I've said before, the performances are great and it's interesting to see new film techniques.  The story is a depressing one however, so if you're looking for a ""feel good"" feeling, this is not the film for it.",1087516800,2,2613,4.270875763747454
1987960,5,B0001CNRRU,"This movie talks about contrasts, warmth against lack of expressiveness : the latinoamerican boundaries vs. the anglosaxon behavior : the whole conception about the basic requirements against the incomplet knowledge about his vital rank.
There's a latinoamerican novel whose reading is very close related to 21 grams . I mean Rayuela from Julio Cortazar . You can read in a random order and the storytellnig is always perfect . Another important point to remark is the poem that Penn tells Naomi is from a living venezuelan poet Montejo .
This is a detor film . A crossroad picture which links three different lives , three different worlds , theree different fates in a dramatical fact.
The love appears as a happy son from the deepest regions from the tragedy and almost wins. The religion , the uncertainity about the life , the redemption , the memory , all that complicated puzzle is told with maestry , with poetic flowness , and accurate direction . The movie never falls in a melodramatic mood , it never let you down . There are always challenging and twists of fate who amazes the viewer through all  the story.
Penn plays the most difficult role of his career. Naomi makes the grade as a character actress and Benicio del Toro gives a very difficult around a man who suffers a true metamorphosis.
The suggested omages , the clue shot about an empty swimming pool reveal the loneliness , the hopeless and the tragedy of that little town , with dark passages and a brilliant use of the color as an addittional actor.
This film is a step ahead in 2003 and one of the best and intelligent films made in Hollywood.

In other words, nobody in this movie behaves as they would in real life: every gesture, every line, is highly exaggerated. Maybe I'd be more open to getting over the pretentiousness if I cared about the characters, but there is no attempt to make them interesting. Add to this that the ""Law and Order"" style shaky-cam never lets up, and you need an aspirin after five minutes. Basically, I'd say that if you loved the movie Traffic -- a better, but also shaky-cam melodramatic pretend version of realism-- then this is the movie for you.

Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu accomplishes this great task with the help of immensely talented actors like Naomi Watts, Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro. Del Toro is frightening as the hard edged born-again Christian who accidentally commits the worst of crimes. Watts is heartbreaking as the victim who buries her sorrows in drugs and alcohol. Penn excels in subtly as the man who receives Watts deceased husbands heart and falls in love with her. It's almost too much emotion to take in at once. All three actors are at their peak and Inarritu plays them off eachother without pretense or falsehood. Each character is decisively different yet all have one horrible thing in common. Inarritu tells this tale in an original, highly edited manner with flashbacks and foreshadowing that never confuses. The film is actually amazingly interesting in its ability to keep scenes tight and emotions as raw as possible.

1987975,4,B0001CNRRU,"Because it's the same director and he deals with both films in a similar fashion, '21 Grams' fails to satisfy the theatre-frequenter. I did not know that the directors were the same before I went in the theatre. Just at the middle of the film though, my memory reminded me of 'Amores Perros' and the similar camerawork, editing and even scenario in that movie. I wasn't wronged. It was Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu.
For the ones who haven't seen Amores Perros, see the movie with full comfort. The movie focuses on the intertwining lives, which are connected to each other by a single event, an incident rather, and resolved by the confrontations of the characters. The editing is done in such a way, that the film's tension increases, as your curiosity increases to match the pieces that don't seem to have a relationship with each other.
More clue? A believer, who lived all his life as an alcoholic sinner and decided to devote himself to Gesus eventually; a sick man, who is about to die if nobody donates a heart to him; and an attractive woman, who has a happy family life.

So if it made it to cinema in your part of the world, don't miss the chance to see a modern masterpiece. Inarritu is undoubtedly one of the more bold directors to emerge from Europe and sneak into Hollywood. Although 21 grams can hardly be categorized as a commercial film (because of the nature of its bleak depiction of modern life) it made a buzz with compelling performances by Penn, Watts and Del Torro (in Oscars 04).
21 grams deals with coincidence, stigma and survival in the most classy manner possible. In terms of cinematography, it is surely one of the more 'beautiful' films shot on camera, and its ironic how it contrasts with the temperature of the film's narrative weight.
Trust me. If there was a show you wanted me to recommend for this year, it would be Mystic River and 21 grams. A brilliant film that commands respect, attention and the eyes of Hollywood. Take the time to appreciate a truly inspiring work of art.",1086307200,,1097,4.517587939698492
1987977,5,B0001CNRRU,"""21 Grams"" is a movie of overwhelming power and drama, told in a compelling fashion by director Inarritu.
Much has been said about the kaleidoscopic, jigsaw puzzle-like storytelling technique used in this film, but it works flawlessly.
Briefly and reduced to absurdity, Sean Penn plays a man with a diseased heart, Naomi Watts plays a happy mother of two with a seriously dark past, and Benicio Del Toro plays a religious fanatic ex-con. I dare not tell you more, because one of the joys of this film is figuring it out the true sequence of events on your own.
These three strangers end up together (you know that from the beginning, given the way the story is told), but being only given snippets of information, in an artful, non-chronological and piece-meal manner, lends extraordinary suspense to the film; you feel guilty even pressing pause. We're talking Hitchcock levels of suspense here...you NEED to know how it's going to end.
""Incendiary"" is an adjective often used to describe an acting performance; you will gasp at Naomi Watts here. I sat slack-jawed and fully amazed. I never knew she could do something like this, and she will surpass your every expectation.
Sean Penn gave the two best performances of the year, here and ""Mystic River"". They're both career performances, in a career full of them. He's making a strong case for being our greatest living actor. Those who think I'm overstating the obvious, consider starting with Spicoli from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", and then imagining roles in ""Falcon and The Snowman"", ""Carlito's Way"", ""Casualties of War"", ""Dead Man Walking"", ""At Close Range""...and ending up in 2003 with those two films mentioned above. Few actors could match that range with that quality, for over two decades straight.
I was not prepared for this film. I was far better than I thought it was going to be. It's the type of movie you want every person who enjoys film and filmmaking to see. You will tell others about it. You will want to talk about it.
Set aside a night to watch this, I implore you. If youv'e read this far, this is the type of movie for you.",1086134400,2,2106,4.756830601092896
1987978,3,B0001CNRRU,"For those who saw Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's first hit movie, rough and hectic ""Amores Perros"", will find his fragmented jigsaw style -- this time in an even more scattered fashion -- familiar. ""21 Grams"" is a more intimate and even darker and more depressing drama, with very few things positive in it, message-wise or otherwise -- save the superb acting performances of the three leads. Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro are especially convincing as the grieving mother and widow on the verge of re-falling deep into drug web and the thief-turned-religious man. The profound tragedy of theirs has its repercussions which involve another man (Sean Penn). Filmed as if with an amateur camera, ""21 Grams"" is not as enthralling as it could be, which is rather good in a weird way, since any more emotional involvement in the film might turn often a difficult watch for a viewer to something unbearable.

It's a film about how 3 different people, all connected in some way to a tragic car accident, deal with the guilt and pain of their lives continuing to move forward ... even when they can't bring themselves to move along with it.
The acting is absolutely SUPERB.  Sean Penn, realistically, could have won an Oscar for BOTH Mystic River and 21 Grams.  He's just OUTSTANDING.  Naomi Watts was also BRILLIANT as a wife and mother whose life is just DESTROYED when her family is killed.  Benico Del Toro, I'm convinced, is one of the most under-appreciated actors of the modern film world.  Even the second tier cast was outstanding.  Melissa Leo, for example, was incredible in the way she played a Lady MacBeth-ish wife to Del Toro's character.
The directing is wonderful.  The emotion that Alejandro Irritu is able to get from his cast is staggering.  Its emotional impact on his audience is mind-blowing.  You'll find yourself tearing up watching Naomi Watts desperately trying to piece her shattered life back together.  I was a little confused in the beginning by the out-of-sequence method that was used in the films editing, but it breaks helps to give the audience a small emotional break (as another reviewer stated, this is a REALLY dark, sad film) and also makes for a better payoff as you fit the pieces of the film together to reveal the whole picture.

Each performance is truly captivating and the director's merciless nonlinear structure adds volumes to the heightened intensity of the story. It's amazing to be glued to a film in which you're always trying to figure out where you are in it. It's a risky narrative move because many people would easily be turned off from a device like this--but Inarritu is a mad composer of slick, realistic, spiritually absorbing masterpieces (check out Amores Perros if you don't believe me)
The film is centered around three characters whose lives are forever changed in the event of tragedy. Sean Penn is his usual brilliant best as a math professor with heart failure, Naomi Watts is equally astonishing as a ex-drug addicted wife and mother suffering terrible loss, and Benicio Del Toro as a Jesus-freak ex-con is gripping to watch on screen has he battles his inner and outer demons.
21 Grams is riveting in the numerous issues it tackles without ever being preachy or verbose. What do our lives weigh? How do we survive immense loss? Are we chosen to take lives and give life?

Cast:  Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, Benicio Del Toro, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Clea Duvall.
Running Time:  125 minutes.
Rated R for violence, language, sexual sitations, and drug use.
As with films such as ""Mulhouland Drive"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"", this somber, intense film will be disturbing and unenjoyable for some, while profound, amazing, and powerful for others.  Director I??rritu succeeds at creating a dark, unique film that does not present itself in chronological order, but scatters the film's main plot points throughout, only for the final puzzle to be revealed in an extremely metaphoric last question.
Sean Penn gives his second-best performance of the year (his explosive role in ""Mystic River"" earned him his first Oscar win) as a terminally-ill heart patient who is in search of a transplant.  Benicio Del Toro stars as the convict-turned Jesus freak who has proclaimed his life to God, only to be a part of the culprit of a misfortunate accident.  Naomi Watts gives her best performance to date as the grief-stricken woman who has tragically lost her family due to a traffic accident, only to find hope in the most unique and surprising of individuals.
The horrific twist of fate and the events proceeding the tragic accident is magically scripted, placed specifically in certain places so the film is more beautiful and enigmatic.  ""21 Grams"" is a portrayal of how one event can change everything for three individuals, the emotional roller-coaster that tragedy brings to all of its victims, and questions the very reason for the existence of mankind.  It is not a film to be embraced by all; it is a motion picture that some will understand and some will shun--but for those who truly enjoy film at its distinct, resounding finest--""21 Grams"" is a visual (not very auditory, for there is not much presence of a musical score) experience that will tear at the heart, overwhelm the mind, and interrogate the soul.

It did seem a little over-the-top at first, and indeed, this would be a fine movie if the story had unfolded chronologically. In the end, however, I have to say that the flash-forwards and flashbacks definitely heightened the dramatic tension and overall experience of this film.
What makes this movie stand out, however, is the incredible acting. Del Toro, Penn, and Watts are all great actors, and all three shine. They were each given tragic, flawed characters to make their own, and each made the most of them. You will likely not ever see better performances from three lead actors.

I personally Sean has the best performance out of the big three.
  The movie moves in and out of past and future never really settling on the what you think the present would be. At times especially in the beginning it can be a little slow, but that just makes for a better ending where everything ties together.
  The great part about the movie is the meaning. It really makes you think, I love movies like that (ex. Requiem for a Dream, American History X). I think the 21 grams that you lose when you die is your soul. There is a great message to this movie.
  Anyways, I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes movies with purposes, or likes to think. I realize not everyone will like this movie, but I think most people enjoy movies with meanings. Thanks for reading.

Sean Penn
21 GRAMS
Twenty-one grams is the weight immediatley lost by the human body upon the moment of death.  Is this the weight of the soul?  Is this the material symbol of the events in our transcendent, trans-material lives?  The beauty of this movie only begins with its way of addressing the un-addressable in life.  Much like the song from the musical RENT, ""525,600 Minutes"", the impossibility of measuring the life of a human being in weight or in time or in anything else, thereby creating the paradox inherent in the movie's title, calls into question the very wisdom of measuring anything at all.
This movie is relentless. The relentless way in which it approaches the deeply griefstricken lives of every character that enters the frame, as every character is dealing with a pain that changes them all, is so powerful and so nearly oppressive that even a sadist would fail at repeating the effect it all has.  Which means the movie is not about that.  It is about, ironically, the overwhelming beauty of life, which becomes as clear as the sunrise, in the presence of debilitating grief and loss.  After all, why else would grief exist?  Is not grief the shadow sometimes drawn when the light of the spirit shines on the human existence?
The disdain of the oppressive convention known as the time line that is one of the hallmarks of director Inarritu's work in this film is magnificent.  It not only makes the scenes of heartbreak even more heartbreaking, but does so in the context of a total integrity to the grandest of human themes that is the theme of this movie, above and beyond any conveniently familiar structure designed really to be its subservient vehicle.
As far as the acting is concerned, I won't insult your intelligence by trying to tell you what kind of a job Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro did.  Just see it.
This movie is definitely worth owning.  It is a profound experience in art, philosophy, technique, love, loss, and life.",1084665600,,2057,4.733893557422969
1988007,4,B0001CNRRU,"Strange tale about interwoven lives surrounding a heart transplant recipient works very well despite a super tragic incident which serves as the movie's centerpiece and garners the audience's attention and sympathy. A woman's family is killed while crossing a street by a drunk driver and she slowly and methodically seeks revenge with the help of her dead husband's heart transplant recipient. Sounds preposterous but it unfolds believably and becomes a genuine think piece that never resorts to heart bludgeoning measures, given the very emotional circumstances involved.",1084406400,2,573,5.674418604651163
1988008,1,B0001CNRRU,"There I am with my girlfriend (who likes to play an intellectual girl) watching 21 grams...
*
From what she said, it was supposed to be a profound, deeply effervescently inspiring moving, emotionally draining, and brilliantly acted film, etc, etc, etc, that would make me see life for another incredible perspective that I've never ever thought about seeing before!!!
*
Then it begins...
*
But what the heck is this? The movie is not only non-linear, it seems to be chaotic (that is, if I'm not giving too much credit for a director that could just have filmed the movie in linear progression, then numbered a lot of scenes, and throw some dices to see where every part would be...)
*
More later this non-linear effect begins to fade... I mean, the movie continues to be non-linear, but after some time, you notice that things are moving linearly, just with some jumps. It's not a boggling mind experience as in Pulp Fiction.
*
Of course, just for this trick (that is better done for a truly genial director like Tarantino) people would already say that this an ""experimental movie that contributes to refine the cinematographic technique!!!""
*
But then begins the hysteria, the boredom, and shallowness...
*
Even the acting in this movie is bad, even though you've got 2 great actors like Sean Penn and Del Toro. They just don't need to use any of their abilities to portray their characters...
*
Sean Penn is this (supposed) math teacher that doesn't need to work (maybe he's rich, we're just not told), and is able to going out looking for widows... Of course, for some mysterious reason, even after getting a heart transplant he's always walking around with some sort of sad face (Things would work well in a terror or porn movie - that is in the former he could be possessed by the spirit of Naomi's ex-husband, in the later, well, in the later things never need to make sense, hehe).  Ah... and later he need to throw out, sometimes too, and smoke... And, make a sex scene with Naomi Watts (one of the few good parts in the movie...)
*
Del Toro is the worst of all... The guy never gets enough... For some reason he thinks that he has to suffer for all eternity... His life is eternal pain, he's disgusted to live, his head is hell, God hates and curses him!! KKKKK... :) KKKKK... Man these mexican guys love a melodrama, don't they? I confess that when he comes back, in the end of the movie, to make Sean Penn kill him, I began to laugh out loud... HA HaH HAHA HAAHA HA K K KKkkkaaaaa.
*
Naomi Watts is the sex relief... Of course, while she doesn't get hysterics... And in one of these programs (Jay Lenno, or other), that scene that she begins to shout with Sean Penn was pointed out as a proof of her ""great talent""... Did anyone get convinced with that scene? The same girl that in other part of the movie doesn't want revenge... Then, she wants everything: sex, drugs (rocking roll?), and revenge... she wants blood, the guy that killed his ex-husband has to pay... Man, and that part that she says to Sean Penn: ""you can't say that you like a woman, that makes us confuse?..."" KKKKKKKKKKaaa HAAAhahahaha... What is this? The director need to know more girls... Or maybe, she's just crazy...
*
And when the movie ends? When you see that if it wasn't for the popcorn, the company of your girlfriend, and the jokes you'll make about how terrible the story is, it would be otherwise a waste of time?
*
You finally realize that the script is just boring and un-original; it's not really written with any consideration as to what the characters would actually say. The back and forth structure of the film is just a lame attempt to try and ""edgy things up"". The film could've been shot the way it was, or done in a linear format, and the outcome still would've been the same. It just jumps on a bunch of really important themes like religion,death,redemption,grief, but never really says anything profound or meaningful about any one of them. The creators just assumed that simply mentioning a deep or profound theme in the movie would turn it automatically deep. And of course, it would sensibilize people with a death in the end, and some silly comments about how heavy is a soul...
*
That's it folks... don't buy it... rent it someday with an open mind, maybe it'll make you laugh sometimes...",1084320000,7,4304,4.567917205692108
1988009,5,B0001CNRRU,"Imagine dumping a jigsaw puzzle out on a table, without the box top to show you what the final picture is. You ""randomly"" pick up the pieces and slowly an image begins to form. This is 21 GRAMS, a story told in non-linear fashion, opening with brief cuts from the beginning, middle, and end. Slowly, patterns emerge, and a unifying vision of the story manifests.
This is a movie about life, death, love, fate, destiny, randomness, and ultimately becomes an exercise in theodicy. Don't be distracted by Sean Penn and Naomi Watts' excellent performance (one of Penn's best ever). This is Benicio del Toro's story. All the main characters struggle to find meaning in life and tragedy, but assembling del Toro's story gives the strongest answer.
We find an interesting resonance between del Toro's evangelical faith in a God who controls every aspect of life and Penn's mathematical determinism-fractals, chaotic, but deterministic. Repeatedly, we see characters surrender their ""free will"" to the forces they believe determine their lives. We listen to the question ""Why?"" and come up empty throughout the movie. In the end, we, the viewers, must find our own ""Why.""
The move suffers some from the mode of story telling. The violently cut, fast-paced opening third of the movie gives way to longer pieces of linear narration. These linear scenes load the movie, slowing it down to real-time, almost sequential action. After the rapid chaos of the beginning, this seems tedious and self-indulgent. But here lies the paradox: without this deceleration, we may never have been able to decipher the story! It serves as a necessary Rosetta stone.
In the end, it's a solid five-star flick. It boldly tackles deep issues and doesn't hand out trite, pre-packaged answers. It is, if you will, an un-morality play. The viewers are not told what to believe, but are left to wrestle with meaning as the credits roll.
The performances are nothing short of spectacular. Sean, Benicio, and Naomi shine through their parts. These are not two-dimensional Hollywood golems enacting a simple story, they are complex characters reflecting the chaotic web of human personality.
It should have swept the Oscars. The haunting score, the superior acting, the impeccable direction, the brutally human script, and unrivaled production set this movie head-and-shoulders above all comers. Unless you think ""Judge Judy"" and ""Survivor X"" are the best entertainment to come down the pike, don't miss this one!

1988012,4,B0001CNRRU,"21 Grams came to UK shores with a bundle of critical acclaim and and an Oscar nomination for Sean Penn.  And it pretty much lives up to the good things people have been saying about it.  Directed by the man behind Amores Perros, you can immediately tell from the way this is filmed that it's not a typical Hollywood melodrama.  The colours are bleached out and the time out of synch.  However, this doesn't mean 21 Grams doesn't have something in common with such films.  The centrepiece of the story is a terrible accident that affects the movie's other characters.  Watching the movie at first is slightly confusing, as it shows us glimpses of things that are yet to happen in the longer sections.  This technique has been used by various directors, notably Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan.  Yet it is the latter director with which 21 Grams shares so much, particularly his little seen first independent affair, Following, which also had very short clips from the future to break up the drama of the main story.  The scenes used for this come across as short exclamations of passion and horror; a dying man covered in blood, a post-coital cigarette and a woman taking drugs in a bathroom.  Whilst it's true that if it weren't for these scenes the movie might be shown as the pretty simplistic drama that it is, this doesn't make it any less compelling or any less good.  For anyone's who's seen the Australian movie Lantana, this will certainly ring a few bells.
What makes the movie though, besides the almost poetic direction, are the performances.  Sean Penn got a lot of credit for his role and deservedly so, though the rest of the cast also give nuanced and complex performances.  Benicio del Toro is superb as the heavy-religious ex-con, depicting a whole range of anger and self-loathing behind his furrowed brows.  In addition, Naomi Watts really comes into her own as the lonely woman falling apart.  It would have been easy to give a shouty, tear-stained performance, but she really lends a desperation to this that is tangible.
Any other year, 21 Grams would have probably sweeped the Oscars, were it not for the phenomenal success and achievement Peter Jackson demonstrated with The Return Of The King.  Whilst it's true to say that in hindsight it's not really as good as it would perhaps like to be, nor as original, it's still a brilliant movie in its own right and one that any fan of intelligent, adult cinema should try to see.",1083715200,3,2457,4.7189695550351285
1988013,4,B0001CNRRU,"""21 Grams"" is the grim story of three strangers whose lives are intertwined by a fatal car crash. Christina Peck, (Naomi Watts), a young wife and mother of two small daughters, loses her entire family in a horrific car accident. Before her marriage, she was apparently a ""hardy partyer,"" and a former drug addict. Unable to cope with her enormous grief, she isolates herself and begins using again, adding alcohol to the drug mix. Jack Jordan, (Benicio Del Toro), a reformed ex-con with a wife and two children of his own, drove the speeding pickup truck that struck and killed Christina's family. He is a Born Again Christian who will go through his own spiritual hell following the tragedy. Melissa Leo gives an outstanding performance as Jack's long suffering, loyal wife. At one point she informs her husband that, ""Life has to go on, with or without God."" Sean Penn plays Paul Rivers, a 40ish mathematics professor dying of heart disease. If he doesn't receive a transplant within a month or so he will die. His marriage has been on the skids for some time but his British wife Mary, (Charlotte Gainsbourg), returns to him, ostensibly to encourage him to follow medical treatment until a heart becomes available. It soon becomes clear, however, that she has come back to have Paul sire a child before he dies. He finally receives a heart and Christina's husband is the donor.
To call this film intense is an understatement. I experienced some serious emotional pain during the 125 minute running time and found myself questioning why I was putting myself through such an ordeal. And make no mistake, much of this is extremely painful material, from the moment one sees Penn wheezing for breath while stealing what could be a final smoke, to watching Watts learn that her family is no more, while being advised that it is best not to view the remains, through experiencing Del Toro's tormenting doubts about whether he betrayed Christ or Christ betrayed him, as he burns the tattooed cross off his arm. This is not easy entertainment, nor is it a film for those with a low pain threshold. Yet Mexican writer/director team Guillermo Arriaga and Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, (Amores Perros), have put together an extremely powerful, compelling, character-driven tale and the performances are brilliant, as one would expect from such a superb ensemble cast. The film's sequence is not in chronological order, but this lack of linear intent did not disturb me at all. I adjusted fairly easily to the movie's collage-like rhythms. It was the constant darkness and suffering that wore me down. The ending did not disappoint me as it did some others. I actually found it to be somewhat poetic, but I won't give it away. This is worth seeing for the acting alone - but only for the strong of heart!

1988014,5,B0001CNRRU,"There's no point in beating around the bush about this.  ""21 Grams"" is a cinematic masterpiece, one of the most brilliant and heart-wrenching films to come our way in the past several years.  In a mere two hours and five minutes, this great work grapples with most of the fundamental themes of life, including death, religion, loss, grief, guilt, recrimination, retribution, redemption, salvation - and does so in a way that is utterly unique, profound, moving and compelling.  Guillermo Arriaga has written a film that virtually defies description; he and director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu have structured the narrative much like a giant puzzle, so that, at the beginning, the film seems like a jumble of unrelated scenes, with images from both the past and the ""present"" thrown together in seemingly random and haphazard order.  Only as the story develops do all those pieces begin to fall into place so that, by the end, we see the Big Picture in all its complete and revelatory glory.  Yet, so skilled are both the writer and director in developing and handling their material that there is not a single moment of confusion throughout the course of the film's running time.  Thanks to the intensity of the performances, the artistry of the writing and directing, and the script's keen observations on human nature, we are drawn into the world of this film in a way that rarely happens in the cinema anymore.
Among other things, ""21 Grams"" boasts one of the most striking and amazing acting ensembles in recent memory.  The film focuses on three initially unrelated individuals whose lives intersect at a single tragic event - a hit-and-run accident that kills a man and his two young daughters who are crossing the street at the moment of impact.  The incomparable Sean Penn plays Paul Rivers, a chain-smoking heart patient who gets a new lease on life when he becomes the donor recipient of the man killed in the accident.  Naomi Watts is Christina Peck, a young reformed drug-addict and wife and mother of the three victims.  Benicio Del Toro is Jack Jordan, a former petty criminal who's turned his life around by ""finding Jesus,"" yet who suffers a life-changing and soul-destroying experience when he runs over the three victims, then flees the scene.  The anguish experienced by each character is conveyed in agonizing detail by these three brilliant performers.  There are also any number of first-rate supporting actors who make an indelible mark on the film and on our hearts, prime among them Charlotte Gainsbourg, as Paul's wife, who is unable to make a claim on her husband's affections despite standing by him through his life-threatening illness, and Melissa Leo as Jack's wife, who, in a similar way, cannot break through the impenetrable wall of guilt and self-loathing Jack has put up between himself and the outside world.  I imagine that ""21 Grams"" will be shown in film courses for years to come, if for no other reason than as a model of superb ensemble acting for fledgling filmmakers to study and emulate.
At its deepest level, ""21 Grams"" is really about how each of us learns to cope with unspeakable tragedy in our lives, as the three main characters are forced to face the bitterest trials life has to offer.  The measure of their character lies in how each of them deals with that trial.  Paul feels a need to bond with the woman whose husband gave him renewed life, even if that bond, and the feeling of personal gratitude and responsibility that comes with it, requires him to take away another man's life.  Christina, now utterly bereft of all that gave her life meaning, finds she can only cope with the utter senselessness of her loss by seeking retaliation on the man she knows is responsible for her emptiness.  Jack undergoes a grave spiritual crisis as he lashes out at God for - as he comes to see it - making him an unwitting participant in the tragedy.  Christina and Jack, in particular, have a great deal in common, since both have succeeded in shaking off the problems of a troubled past, only to have their source of salvation (in her case, her family and, in his, religion), mercilessly pulled out from under them.  Indeed, all three characters have their lives and souls torn asunder by the shattering vicissitudes of everyday life.  And their emotional pain becomes ours.
Put quite simply, ""21 Grams"" is the single best movie I have seen in years, a complete artistic triumph for all involved.  It will leave you reeling.",1083456000,,4473,4.8285340314136125
1988024,5,B0001CNRRU,"When I first started watching 21 Grams, I thought, just as you're supposed to, what the HELL is going on. For 21 minutes, 21 Grams made absolutely no sense. It was a convoluted mess of various scenes mostly revolving around three seemingly unconnected characters, Paul Rivers (Sean Penn), a terminally ill college professor, Christina Peck (Naomi Watts), a mother, housewife and recovering addict and Jack Jordan (Benecio Del Toro), a born again Christian with a past. But right from the beginning, during the intro, when you get a flash of Rivers and Watts together in bed, you know their paths will cross. In fact that was one of the confusing things, they weren't yet an item.
This film was shot in chronological order with hand held cameras only and then edited totally out of sequence. In the second 21 minutes, you get a vague idea of what's going on. Rivers/Penn is vacillating between healthy and extremely fragile, Watts/Peck is swimming at her swim club one minute and in despair the next and Jordan/Del Toro is going from Proselytizing to jail. It's still confusing as hell but at least you're finally able to figure out that some scenes are in the future and some in the past.
In the third 21 minutes, tragedy befalls Peck and Jordan in the form of an auto accident, a tragedy which indirectly benefits Rivers, who receives the heart of a grieving Peck's husband. Rivers is intrigued if not greatful and wants to know more about his beneficiary, so he hires a detective.
In the fourth 21 minutes, although it's still jumbled, the story finally starts to come together. Rivers boots his girlfriend and manages to meet and gain Peck's trust. A rattled, guilt ridden Jordan gets released from jail and leaves his family and rejects his faith. Jack Jordan is a lost soul.
Of course the remaining 42 minutes of the story is for you to find out.
Conclusion
Even with the unconventional method of story telling in the film, it conveyed the emotion, no it tranferred the emotion to me. This is a story of anguish, of hopelessness. Though it is probably fiction, it brings tears to my eyes as I write about it, as I can empathize with the characters. I can't say enough about the performances of Watts and Del Toro. The movie just oozed with Christina Peck's Pain and Jack Jordan's overwhelming guilt. Sean Penn's part, while not as emotional was equally well delivered.

1988025,4,B0001CNRRU,"A film by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu
This is a difficult film to review because it is not a conventional film by any means.  There are fantastic acting performances, and layers of detail, but the structure of the film is what presents the challenge.  ""Memento"" was a movie that had a story that was told out of sequence, but the way ""Memento"" was edited worked perfectly because there was a definite method and clear purpose that fit the story being told (the story was told in reverse order).  Unlike ""Memento"", I was not able to figure why the scenes in ""21 Grams"" were out of chronological order.  This is a powerful film, but it might also be needlessly complex (complexity for complexity's sake).
Here's what we know about the movie (though exactly when we get everything fitted together is a little unclear).  Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is dying.  He needs a heart transplant rather badly.  Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-con trying to turn his life around.  He has become a Christian, but still struggles with his anger.  Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) has lost both her husband and her two children in an auto accident.  These three separate lives will start to intertwine as the movie progresses, but to give more than a simple description of who each of these characters are will be to spoil how they interact and why, and what happens to them.  The disjointed chronology of the film makes describing it even more difficult because scenes from the beginning of the film only make sense when connected to a scene more than an hour later.
In one sense, watching this film is an exercise in understanding.  We see the film play out and we are (or at least I was) working to figure out how everything fits together both as a part of the story as well as to the greater theme of the movie.  The movie is titled ""21 Grams"".  It is said that the weight of a human soul is 21 grams because that is, supposedly, how much weight a body loses when a person dies.  The film, in my view, is trying to measure a human life, to see what it means to be human, especially in the face of death.  On one hand, the film succeeds.  On the other, human life and experience is so varied that what may be meaningful for one viewer may be less so for another.  I thought this was a powerful, well acted film, but the out of order format of the film was a little distracting.  I'm not sure about the purpose of setting up the movie with the mixed up chronology.  This is a good one, even a very good movie.  The acting is great, but I'm not sure if the movie is.",1083283200,2,2550,4.394456289978678
1988026,4,B0001CNRRU,"I bought 21 GRAMS over a month ago and kept finding excuses not to watch it C anticipating its reputation for being a hard on the soul, but oddly enough I ended up succumbing on a dreary rainy afternoon anyway. I cant say it was very uplifting, but I expected so much. It is, nonetheless, a very thought provoking film filled with resonant performances, great visuals and subtle but moving music. I really cannot divulge anything about the plot C the reverse of the DVD box is no more revealing C but the story revolves predominantly around 3 characters (Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, and Benicio Del Toro), whose lives collide.
The film is a bit of a puzzle (in more ways than one); scenes are edited together in a seemingly random order, a mix of later scenes first and earlier scenes last. Despite some similarities in concept, films such as MEMENTO or IRREVERSIBLE still work differently in that they begin at the end and go backwards towards the beginning in a reliable countdown fashion. 21 GRAMS is in contrast kind of all over the place.
The Oscar nominations for Watts and Del Toro were well deserved, and Sean Penn could also have been nominated, though his characters motives are not quite as clear and fleshed out as the others'. The supporting cast is excellent too by the way.  All the characters in this film are flawed in some way, which in my mind is one of the strongest aspects of the film. Normally in Hollywood films, everyone is so darn perfect, or if they have flaws, they always figure everything out by the time the credits roll. Well, that doesnt happen here. So if you're hoping for this warm and fuzzy sense of closure at the end, youve got another thing comin. Thats not to say you're left hanging in limbo, but perhaps for some viewers the hope and promise for better days for the characters will be too subtle to appreciate.
As for me, I really enjoyed this film despite its heaviness. While I was relieved when it was over, my exhaustion was more reflective of the film getting under my skin than dissatisfaction, so I can still really recommend it. The acting is superb and the drama feels real. I am really looking forward to seeing what this films director Alejandro Gonzlez I09rritu does next.",1083196800,2,2223,4.599496221662468
1988027,5,B0001CNRRU,"If you didn't enjoy Memento or Irreversible because it jumped around and required a lot of concentration on your part, then this movie is not for you.  Edited in a non-linear fashion, this movie jumps from scene to scene regardless of suspense. (i.e. Hollywood typically edits movies to follow a linear timeline where it may look like: A, B, C, D, E, and so on. 21 Grams scenes went something like: Q, B, E, A, H, C, W, and so on.)
For the first half-hour I was a little lost, and wondered where it was all going.  But thinking back on it now, that's just how the characters were feeling, lost and wondering where this is all going, or what this is all leading to. I can equate it to cutting the spine off a book and reading the loose pages at random.
Sean Penn is at the top of his game with this one. He's consistent, and quickly draws you to his side, which is something many actors struggle with. You really start to feel sorry for his character (Paul), but when you see him in the next scene (which happens to be much later in the timeline) he is chiseling away at the image we were just starting to sympathize with.
Naomi Watts plays a distraught widow that just lost her husband and two-daughters to a hit and run driver (don't worry; I'm not spoiling anything here.) She's so good you'll be choked up a few times from her acting alone; very consistent and very convincing.
Benicio Del Toro. Now where should I start? I have often found his over-drawn accent and hair-flipping a bit of a distraction in the past, but in 21 Grams he is on spot. He plays an ex-con, ex-alcoholic, ex- thief, ex-thug that is now a Born Again Christian trying to help other `ex-whatevers' stay on the straight and narrow. His new lifestyle is a bit more than his wife can handle, not to mention those that he is trying to help. (He must have found his character-study in a pastor of a cinderblock bunkhouse in some out-of-town church run by an ex-Hell's Angel, because no one just dreams this kind of character up in their set trailer.)
Great plot, three actors at their best, and an awesome way of editing the movie!
I highly recommend 21 Grams!  You'll need to watch it without interruptions and be able to give it your undivided attention; otherwise you'll get lost and then end up not enjoying the movie.",1082851200,3,2294,4.418439716312057

1988029,4,B0001CNRRU,"This DVD is completely void of Special Features, and for good reason.  After viewing the film, one will most likely be left in introspective contemplation, on the meaning of life, the weaving in of God's will, and the eternal mystery of tragedy and the loss of life.
  Sean Penn has always and will always inspire me to be an actor.  So effortlessly does he embody his character, that it takes a while to adjust to him from film to film, whilst you believe that he is still such and such a character.  His first round match up with Naomi Watts here is a great choice.  Through in Benicio Del Toro as the quasi-innocent villain and in my opinion you've got a great cast.
  The imaginative script comes from a great novel.  The crafty filmaking on lesser quality film adds to the ""gritty reality"" feel of the movie.  It weaves through time reminiscent of Memento and more recently Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (which I highly recommend!).  If you have an unsettled stomach, than I suggest some contemplation before watching this film.  Otherwise, enjoy these thought provoking films while they still exist.",1082505600,,1113,4.739583333333333
1988030,5,B0001CNRRU,"21 grams is the kind of movie that makes you contemplate your own life and existence, and forces you to ponder the the meaning and interconnectedness of life itself.
The movie sports a not-too complicated and jaw-droppingly ironic plot. The death of a man and his two children brings the lives of 3 people together in an odd and tragic turn of events. The really unique thing about the movie I felt was the way in which it was shot. Scenes from the movie are not only displayed out of chronological order, but scattered throughout the length of the movie in a seemingly random order. This was sheer briliance. It's also why you might find the plot a little hard to follow and a bit confusing at first. You'll constantly be asking which one was that, who was that guy, what just happened, where did that come from. For me this served two purposes: one it kept the movie very interesting and in deed captivating from begining to end (the movie would probably have felt more slow and dry if done traditionaly), two it almost seems like a metaphor for life. An illustration of what the movie is all about and trying to say. Sequences of scenes often make no sense untill later on, just as in life you often don't understand what happened untill looking back and connecting all the dots. Also the constant feeling of confusion and randomness does well to push the point that life just seems to happen and no one really knows what's going on or what's connected.
The style of the shooting also does a great job of making you feel as if you aren't watching a movie, but rather are just witnessing glimpses of moments of the actual lives of these people, scattered and momentarily incoherent untill finally we see how it's all connected. This really was fantastic I thought and very effective.
The emotional impact is also extremely noteworthy. The movie studies how odd the events in life are, and how cruel life can be. Grief is one of the prime components of the film and the examination of how every action in the world bares a reaction. The events in the movie will often leave you just sitting there silent looking at the screen with a knot in your gut. Anyone who has experienced pain and loss will relate in a most personal way.
The acting for this film was also excellent throughout. The whole cast did a great job, and the performances are not just believable but inspired.
Most of all 21 grams pushes the point that we are all just kind of floating along through life, bumping into each other and being either victim or benefactor to a never ending line of factors that are beyond our control. is it fate, destiny, or the plan of some divine diety that puts us where we are, or is the universe just meaningless and we are all merely billiard balls randomly bumping into one another. 21 Grams examines, but offers no real answer to all these questions, and will at very least provide for some interesting conversation afterwards.
If you're the type of person who likes phillosophy, or enjoys a well-done artistic movie about life that really makes you think, then this movie is for you.",1082073600,5,3088,4.565765765765766
1988031,1,B0001CNRRU,"The director's first film was about a car accident which affected the lives of three main characters. This film is about a car accident which affects the lives of the three main characters.
First off lets admit that the film has some great acting performances from the three main leads with Sean Penn and Naomi Watts being impressive.
However the film is simply annoying. It is not structured as a straight linear narrative. Rather what happens is that the film is cut into a large number of fragments and each fragment is then jumbled around and played in a random order. The film thus requires a mild amount of effort to work out who is who and to rebuild the narrative struture. This mildly unusual approach cannot however hide the fact that the film is basically an overblown melodrama which depends on the chaotic presentation to hide that.
If we look at its elements it consists of a number freaky and bizaree plot elements. A man who has a heart transplant developing a relationship with the wife of the donor. A ex-convict who has redemed himself through religion but is the subject of a freak accident. Their lives interact and tragedy ensures.
If one looks in retrospect at what happens the characters by and large, are self absorbed, unlovely and stupid. The somewhat artificial plot is meant to hide this from us and suggest that the characters are motivated by the extreme tragedy of their lives. The use of hand held cameras and somewhat overexposed filming again is a means to suggest that somehow this is all very interlectual or important in some way. A tiresome way to spend an afternoon watching this stuff.",1081987200,15,1626,4.72887323943662

1988044,4,B0001CNRRU,"The most telling moment in Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu's moving 21 Grams comes in a lunchroom exchange between Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) and Christina Peck (Naomi Watts), in which Paul, a mathematics professor, observes, ""there are so many things that have to happen for two people to meet.""
Paul's line is the key to the film's non-linear, disjunctive, dyschronic narrative style, which simulates the routine randomness and disorder of life, the contingencies of existence, the sheer improbability of any one particular thing ever coming to pass - over and against Irritu's spiritual subtext, which gives the movie its title and which buzzes insistently beneath the main events and performances. How many movies - Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors comes to mind - compel the viewer to reflect on the theodicy question, the existence of evil in the world despite the presumed goodness of a God?  This is courageous filmmaking.
Before the first hour is out, the main narrative lines have clarified, ambiguities begin to sort themselves out, and, abetted by chance, Paul has manipulated the story into an intense tale of odd obsession. The irregular narrative strategy also provides an element of mystery, and the story remains intriguing and unpredictable right through an ultimately well-foreshadowed conclusion.
The accomplished cast delivers performances that are among the best of their careers.  Penn, Benicio Del Toro as an ex-con come to Jesus and on the rebound, and, in particular, Watts as a bereaved mother and wife whose questionable past becomes a doubtful source of solace, offer rangy, moving, multi-dimensional interpretations of complex human beings as they are sucked through the defining, harrowing, moments of their lives. Watts displays an utter absence of movie-star vanity in permitting herself to be wholly disfigured by overpowering emotions. Del Toro continues to challenge himself, and amaze us, in each of his distinctive, shaded performances. Penn's acting here is more restrained, more subtle than his superb Jimmy Markum of Mystic River.
I docked 21 Grams a star for the patness of its conclusions. Irritu brings everything together too tidily and to too calm a center - wouldn't so disjunctive a reality have had a few wires and transistors hanging out of the chassis? (And I would have enjoyed at least a dollop of DVD commentary as to how this film came to pass. The disc is a blank, however, apart from the film, scene access, and setup.) Even so, this is a very brave piece of writing, direction, and performance - I would have added ""production,"" but Irritu produced his own film, for surely no one else would have permitted him to realize his very particular vision of time, contingency, and spirituality. 21 Grams is not a picture for every taste, but it is a strong, challenging antidote to the mass of pulp that passes for popular cinema.",1081641600,4,2877,5.132196162046908

While not bad people, they are just not very likable or interesting.  Clocking in at two hours and five minutes it seemed three hours and fifty five minutes as the story develops at a snail's pace.  As others have said there is some decent acting here, especially by Naomi Watts so I'll offer two stars for that, otherwise this is just another average flick.

First, the lead actress is Naomi Watts, who never really has impressed me, despite the award nominations that she has received.  Plus in the film trailers I got the impression this was more a spiritual/super-natural story.  But in reality, it is a very well done mystery and romance story.
Sean Penn shines, as he usually does, as the mathematician who receives a heart transplant from Watts' husband, who along with their two daughters are run down by a truck driven by Benecio del Toro.  The story is confusing at first as snippets from the end of the story are cut into the early part of the story.  I found myself wondering what was going on for about the first 20 minutes or so.  But as the story progresses, it really begins to make sense (I probably should have watched it a second time to see what I missed in those 20 minutes).

1988051,4,B0001CNRRU,"Mr. Inarritu's ""21 Grams"" is a moving and spellbinding drama that finds the director tackling similar ground as he did in his last film ""Amores Perros"" when a car accident is the center of the story. He also once again tells his story through a non-linear format, that allows us, the viewers, to know some clues to the future of the character's; in this case ill-fated. The performances from it's three leads are extraordinary. Penn is at his best as a dying man who desperately needs a heart transplant, but when he gets it, at what cost? Del Torro is captivating as the ex-con who forces his new christian way of life on his family in an attempt to better himself, but what would fate have in store for him? Last but certainly not least is the phenomenal Naomi Watts as wife and mother suffering through tragedy.
The performances alone are worth every minute of this great film and the only thing that the director's attention on his story telling devise hurts in this film, is that it gets in the way of the characters. Could we have gotten to know them better and feel their pain better had we had time to experience it with them as it happened instead of cutting back and forth, finding things about their future as they wait oblivious like sitting ducks.

1988052,4,B0001CNRRU,"With the 2003 movie year behind us, it's clear to me that a major theme film makers explored in last year's releases is that of revenge and, more importantly, the inability of revenge to right committed wrongs. ""21 Grams"" is a bleak, sober story about a grief-crazed woman seeking revenge out of desperation, the man who volunteers to help her carry out her desires and the ex-con who serves as the object of her revenge.  The story has all the simplistic sadness of a tragedy, but that's not to say the movie itself is simplistic.  Thematically, it's actually quite complex.  In addition to the idea of revenge, the movie explores the ideas of fate and how one's own fate can be tied up in the fates of others; the value of life and the existence of the soul; and the fragility of physical and mental states.
The acting is uniformly solid.  People have seemed to single out Naomi Watts for praise, but that seems unfair to Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro.  Indeed, the movie is so evenly divided into thirds, each third belonging to one of the principal characters, that it takes on an ensemble feel, with no one actor shining above the others.
The film was criticized somewhat for its unnecessarily complicated structure, but that didn't bother me.  Once you get through the first disorienting ten minutes or so, the pieces begin to fall into place, and loose ends are tied up deftly.  It may be a bit pretentious--the fragmented narrative reflecting the fragmented souls of the characters--but it could have been handled much worse.
Finally, kudos to the editor, who had the daunting task of assembling this film into coherency, and especially because of the fragmented approach.
Grade: A-",1080604800,,1691,4.77054794520548
1988053,2,B0001CNRRU,"21 Grams is `not really a good film' masquerading as `interesting experimental cinema' that has a lot of failings which will be obvious to you after the first ten minutes. Although 21 Grams is far from the worst movie you will see, beware that it does push the suspension of disbelief and the non-linear format of the storyline does not actually work.
Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu brings us a story that has been chopped by the Avid editing machine to the point where every single scene is completely disconnected. Endings occur in the start and the middle. Beginnings occur in the end and the middle. The middle occurs in the start and the end. So how does the actual abuse of this kind of narrative work? Well maybe a better story would have survived it but by the time you put the pieces together you realize just how farfetched and implausible the story really was... maybe even possibly conned. Also this experimental editing results in a severe disconnection for the viewer. You will not engage any of the characters or the story until at least more than an hour into the film and even then you have seen so much over-the-top drama and acting that at times it can be extremely boring and hard to take.
21 Grams aspires to be something like the inventiveness of the sequence of events in ""Irreversible"", crossed with the hype of ""The Hours"", mixed in with the corniness of an episode of ""Dynasty"". There are some moments in the film that will make you laugh even though the director did not intend it. Some scenes come out of the blue that honestly do to match the storyline. There are moments that will try your patients and you will shake your head about what all the fuss was over. The critics have got this one a little wrong in the same way that they got ""The Hours"" a little wrong and gave ""Far from Heaven"" more hype that it really deserved.
Basically to tell the whole story would spoil it for you however it can easily be summed up by saying that Sean Penn plays a man who is sick and in need of a heart transplant. Naomi Watts plays a widow who has lost her family in an accident that was caused by Benicio Del Toro, a reformed con who just can't quite get it right with Jesus even though he wants too. The stories eventually come together but for all intensive purposes this is no ""Pulp Fiction"" and ends up looking more like a lame unbelievable story that Gonzlez Irritu decided to chop around and give it his ""art stamp"" of approval so that we would not notice that he has cooked up a really dismal film that does not conform to the standards of storytelling that warrant the kind of ""realism"" that the acting portrays. Yes we know that Watts can take off her clothes. Yes we know she can crack up and throw out a performance when asked for it. Yes we know that Penn can change his image almost to the point where he is not recognizable. Yes we know that he too can bring real life to characters. Yes we know that Del Toro has it in aces. Yes we know that he can almost play anything that he puts his mind too. However the question begs to be answered - Why is it that a non-mainstream film like 21 Grams seems to fail like a bad mainstream movie?
For this reason many will come away feeling that the experimental editing is just a camouflage for what should have been a direct to video release. It is good to see movies sideline mainstream Hollywood values and I am a fan of art films (as I am sure many who want to see 21 Grams are) but this is not one of those winners. By all means watch 21 Grams to support this kind of change in the industry (Gonzlez Irritu has potential) but by the time the credits roll you will realize that you have indeed just watched a film that has bombed. Good ideas, one-off experimentation, interesting characters and acting but not really a good film (or a film at all) by any means. Extreme Caution is advised.",1080604800,14,3859,4.368567454798331

I understand this is to achieve an effect of showing the fragmentation of these people's lives, but as a movie device, it does not really work. By showing us the ending in the middle of the movie removes all possible suspense.
This technique works for films such as pulp fiction because t is expansionist and not confined as 21 grams. We see Travolta's character die in the middle, but we understand that there are more characters and that his significance as a life is significantly reduced. In 21 grams, these three characters are in the foreground constantly; we get to know them intimately. not that I did not like this movie. These are the three best performances of the year. Sean Penn is subdued and wonderfully weary as a heart transplant recipient. Naomi Watts gives the best performance of her career as a grieving mother and wife turning to drugs to ease her pain.

1988066,5,B0001CNRRU,"The producer of 2000's ""Amores Perros"" presents another film masterpiece.  The three-time Oscar nominated ""21 Grams"" explores deeper into his unique creativity.  Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu leads a talented cast and crew to complete this unforgettable experience.  The plot is brilliant.  The ensembe of three lives that come together for a life-changing accident blends perfectly.  The writers force audiences to think more on the events and piecing every scene together.  Future and past events being placed in various places offer a more unique intimate look into the characters' lives.  The irony continually builds, keeping audiences paying attention to what actually happens and what actually is.  Few other writers have mastered this technique this well.  The drama builds as one tradegy adds to another.  The conflict between their struggles and they keep every scene interesting: a man struggling to maintain his health after severe heart problems, a cocaine addict struggling to recover from the death of her husband and her two kids, and an ex-con struggling with his newfound Christianity.  The graphic scenery offer a deeper look at their inner death threats.
Every actor offers their own sense of tradegy through their character and the film.  Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro are brilliant in their Oscar nominated roles (Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor).  This brings them into more intimate roles that earns them tremendous respect as talented actors.  Watts transforms her image for this role of a lifetime that explores her more serious side.  Sean Penn is outstanding in his role as a heart transplant patient.  This is only one film that proves that 2003 was his year as an actor.  He continues to evolve as an outstanding actor, expecially within the last ten years.
""21 Grams"" is a great powerdrama for those looking for something intense.  This is sure to please audiences for many years to come.  Inarritu's ""Amores Perros"" is also recommended for fans of ""21 Grams"".",1080345600,,1996,5.220125786163522
1988067,4,B0001CNRRU,"Watching ""21 Grams"" for the first time, I was expecting a dark drama that centered around death, and this is indeed what I got. This is a well-written film, and the editing deserves much credit, because the fractured cuts make this movie more interesting than if it went straight through start to finish. That could have made this film more melodramatic than it was, so this jumpy editing is definitely a good thing.
You can't say much about this film without talking about the acting. I have never been a big fan of Sean Penn, but he is incredible in this movie, bringing a certain innocence and creepiness to his character, a deathly ill man seeking the person who saved his life. Benecio del Toro is a revelation here, providing the best work of his career, even better than his Oscar-winning performance in ""Traffic"". He plays an ex-convict who has found Jesus, and found him adamantly, becoming an aggressive bible thumper who lives by the harsh rules of the bible. Trouble seems to follow him everywhere, and his life seems to be a string of bad luck, and we sympathize with his character, even though he could technically be called the ""bad guy"". But the best acting in this film has to go to Naomi Watts. She has already given a couple of very strong performances in her career, and she is no longer just known as Nicole Kidman's best friend, because she has the chops to stand on her own two feet. Playing a devastated mother and recovering drug addict, Watts allows the audience to love her and hate her for what she does to herself following her life-altering tragedy. Nearly every scene she is in is memorable, and her Oscar nomination for this role was very much deserved.
The best part about the writing of this film is that although there is not much back story shown about each character, they still manage to be incredibly deep people, and we know about their pasts through small comments. In the end, we manage to care about all the three people involved, and this is what brings this film from being average to being great. Also, the director should be recgnized for some gritty directing, taking what could have been a story that was too fluffy, to a dark, engaging drama.
Although the DVD is lacklustre, having no special features, the transfer is good, and the movie itself is enough to make this a worthwhile purchase. Editing, writing, directing and acting have taken an average film and made it into something special, therefore I would highly reccomend ""21 Grams"".",1080259200,2,2490,4.674259681093394

1988069,5,B0001CNRRU,"If you are a young actor, or just love a well acted movie, you must check this film out. I cannot recall a movie were there were so many standout performances. As always, Sean Penn displays his usual nearly supernatural talent. Penn can do more with his eyes and expression than any actor I can think of, and his capacity for effective understatement is unparalleled. He can simply move the viewer wherever he wishes them to go effortlessly, and he is always a marvel to watch. Benicio Del Toro is tremendous as well, doing what he does best - bringing to life a certain tortured repression that always seems to brood a little too quietly behind his burning eyes.
For me, however, the delight came from watching the women, Naomi Watts as the grieving widow who serves as a catalyst in the films' intertwined lives; and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the wife of an ex-con, desperately trying to hold her life together. Naomi Watts is asked to carry a great deal of weight in this picture, and her raw pain and emotion really had me twisting in my seat in sympathy. She actually accomplished that rare feat that happens so seldom in movies: Her pain and grief didn't seem like acting at all - it seemed rather that cameras just happened to rolling while some terrible event was happening. She was absolutely amazing.  My favorite piece of work, however, came from Charlotte Gainsbourg. With all the bigger names doing such great work around her, it is an easy role to overlook. Do yourself a favor and watch this woman take command of her role. Her portrayal of the ex-cons' wife, struggling to keep what little she has managed to salvage out of the world together, is simply heartbreaking. I wish Hollywood used more actresses like her. Ms. Gainsbourg is not a fashion model, nor is she beautiful in a high-cheekbone, pouty-lipped way. She is, instead, beautiful to watch because of her talent.
To tell you the truth, this type of character-based, dialogue-driven drama is not my usual meat. I like a good crime or action picture, big-Hollywood style.

It jumps around the timeline of their lives, showing us their good sides before the events that destroy them and in a CUT, show the turmoiled people they will eventually become when the events all tie together, and then back again.
In favor of the movie, the scenes cut together nicely. The scenes make you wonder, make you question, what caused this? How do Paul Rivers (Penn) and Cristina Peck (Watts) come to know each other and become lovers? The scenes pose all the right questions and move the movie nicely.
My only problem was in the fact that I'm not sure that the mixed timeline storytelling may not have been necessary. In hindsight, after viewing the entire film, I'm not sure if the jigsaw puzzle of scenes wasn't just done IN AN ATTEMPT TO be cutting edge, Pulp Fictionish and OSCARISH??
The story could have just as easily been told in chronoligical order and held the exact same amount of weight and entertainment value.
Finally, for all the timeline jumping around and making you wonder this and that, 21 GRAMS was disappointing to me. When it was all said and done, I expected something more. 21 GRAMS had a ho-hum story, but acting performances that will blow you out of the water.",1079913600,,1819,4.515151515151516
1988072,5,B0001CNRRU,"Film and video are the most powerful media tools ever created. For the most part, though, these tools are mainly used to make entertainment that rarely causes our brains to actual think or our emotions to truly get into gear. In part, this may be caused by our instinctive suspicion of any outside force that can disrupt or challenge the way we think and feel. ""21 Grams"" is a force to be reckoned with. Watching it will not entertain you as much as it will shake you up mentally and emotionally. It is a brilliant example of the power a movie is capable of producing.
The plot moves forward and backwards in time, but I found it very easy to follow.
The central characters are Paul [Sean Penn], a professor whose heart is literally giving out; Christina [Naomi Watts], a woman whose husband and two children are killed in a hit and run accident; and Jack [Benicio del Toro], a recovering alcoholic and born-again Christian, whose attempts to get his life together are wrecked when he accidentally runs over Christina's family with his truck. After this terrible event, a distraught Christina donates her brain-dead husband's heart. The recipient is Paul, who can not live without knowing whose heart he has. His investigation leads to the amazing intersection of the three characters' lives.
Director Inarritu is Mexican. He explored a similar theme in his brilliant and highly recommended ""Amores Peros"". [Note: Mexico produces some of the best movies on the planet.]
It is obvious that the cast related to the script. Penn and del Toro, as well as supporting players Charlotte Gainsborough and Melissa Leo, are brilliant. Penn's performance rivals the one he gave in ""Mystic River"". The world is lucky that he reneged on the promise he made several years ago to quit acting. Watts, however, is the real star of the picture. Whatever is beyond brilliant is what she is here. Hers is one of the greatest performances ever recorded on film.",1079827200,,1940,4.828828828828829

I won't do that. Sure, I was a bit baffled at the goings-on, but director Inarratu weaves a tapesty that results in a mind-blowing catharsis. This is one of those ""full-circle"" films with flash-backs, flash-forwards, and relies on the viewers ability of retention. The three leads are brilliant, and I take issue with a previous reviewer about Watts' character; grief affects people in different ways, and I thought her decisions were appropriate to the developments. Her performance was dead-on, as well as those of Penn and del Toro. I was very impressed. The film is grim and unpleasant with its subject matter. However, its ugliness is countered with daring honesty, something that many don't really ever think they'll have to deal with. Life, death, love, hope, desperation and redemption have rarely been examined so thoroughly on film. To say I loved this film would be like saying I loved a root canal; still, I felt that it was important, and extremely well presented. Once the power of the novocaine wears off, you find yourself thinking a lot about your own mortality. Unfortunately, the DVD offers no extras of any kind.",1079827200,,1299,4.909090909090909

Yet they seem to have no issues with forcing the viewer to sit through 10 minutes of previews before the main menu even appears.  The only way to bypass these annoyances is to fast forward through them which is a major hassle and still takes some time.  Why these ""major"" studios still feel it their duty to foist these previews upon us is easily seen:  To sell more movies.  Universal, you are a big fat joke.  Perhaps some day, the Criterion Collection will give this film the treatment it deserves.
The film itself is quite good.  And if the film and dark story don't do it for you, the cast will.  The performances of the 3 stars are first rate.

21 Grams has been acclaimed as Naomi and Sean's shining moments.  Let me say that Sean Penn is excellent, but Naomi didn't deliver the extraordinary performance that I was expecting (based on her Oscar nomination).  On top of that her character lost credibility.  One minute she says that ""nothing will bring them back"", then in a future scene she wishes to kill the man who did it.

Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro should have won the Oscar's they were nominated for, and Sean Penn should have been nominated for this because I liked it better than Mystic River.

And for God's sake, who let Benetio's character out of jail so soon and allowed him to work a construction job? A triple manslaughter charge (and conviction) should have ket the guy locked up for years, effectively negating the whole revenge premise of the last half of the movie. Don't tell me he was just out on bail.
And recruiting the transplant recipient to kill the perp? Highly ridiculous. A deeply depressing movie, though I still enjoyed the performances a lot, especially Naomi's grief-stricken and conflicted performance. However, Sean Penn never fails to bum me out with his choice of ""heavy"" downer material, and this is no exception. Message to Sean: Lighten up, tough guy.

Pulp Fiction was divided up into chapters so that the audience never REALLY got lost.  I'm curious to see what the shooting script for this film was like - if it was written this way or if the effect was completely created in the editing room.  EVERY SCENE takes place at a different point in the story and almost NO TWO SCENES follow consecutively.  It's fascinating to watch the movie unfold.  True, it is a gimmick, but it is a gimmick that works.  As we see bits of the end and bits of the beginning, we strain to put all the pieces together and understand what is happening.  This process may be vexatious for the occasional movie-goer - he will become lost and bored with a plot that doesn't unfold in a straightforward manner.

Yes, this movie, one I thought I would not like, has left it's mark on my very soul ... all 21 grams of it.
Told through a series of present scenes and flashbacks, it is initially very confusing. In that sense it reminded me of the movie Memento. Once you get the hang of what's in the present vs. what is in the past, you become so immersed in the movie ... it grabs your heart and doesn't let go.
This is a story about a critically ill college professor, a young widow, and an ex-con. It's a story about life, death, sin, and redemption. It is very suspenseful as well as very touching and gut-wrenching. When you finish watching this movie you'll sit in wrapped silence - too stunned to think about anything else.
Though this may be a little too intense for some sensitive souls, I highly recommend this movie. It's extremely well acted, the story line is very well presented, and complete engrossing. You'll never forget it.",1079654400,,1105,4.3951219512195125

1988093,5,B0001CNRRU,"2003 belongs to Sean Penn. He gave two of the best performances of the year in two of the year's best movies, Mystic River (for which he won the Best Actor Oscar) and 21 Grams. 21 Grams, however, has gotten far less attention than Clint Eastwood's film. I, personally, find it the better of the two. It was directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, director of the excellent Amores Perros from 2000, and it bears the mark of its skilled director. In 21 Grams, as in Amores Perros, Inarritu handles heavy subject matter - life, death, loss and regret, and weaves seperate storylines together. I don't want to talk about the story, but Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro play three characters all connected by a tragic incident. The acting is uniformly excellent. The leads give three big staggering performances that are incredibly moving. Alejandro Inarritu does a solid job directing, giving the film a distinct look and feel that separates it from more mainstream fare. He has the potential to be a major director and I can't wait to see what he's doing for his next film.
There has been some debate over whether or not it was necessary to tell the story out of chronological order. I don't think 21 Grams would be a lesser film if it were told in chronological order, but do I think it does contribute to feel of the movie. It gives us somewhat of a sense of confusion and helplessness like that of the characters'. I also like the way that the structure makes the film a series of individual moments without concern for time.
I feel that 21 Grams is one of the best movies of 2003. Anyone who is looking for a gripping, exhilarating, moving film experience need look no further. If you are looking for bland, mindless entertainment, this is not it. This is a powerful film of real emotional substance. It is not a ""fun"" movie. If you appreciate real filmmaking with brilliant and honest acting, 21 Grams will be a riveting, unforgettable experience.",1079568000,,1961,4.654178674351585
1988094,3,B0001CNRRU,"Everyone loses exactly 21 grams at the moment of death....This is the myth from which the title was drawn, and it hints at the ""heart"" of the movie.
21 Grams is a study of death, life, and grief.  A heart transplant recipient (Penn) seeks information about his donor, and in so doing becomes involved with the donor's widow (Watts).  Del Toro plays the ex-con who links them, as he is the man responsible for the death of Watts' husband and two daughters.
Penn and Watts are both seeking reaffirmation of life, and find this in eachother.  They share love, grief, death, and ultimately life again.  Del Toro also makes a similar journey, dealing with grief and guilt, and then returning to life. In the end, life must go on for those left behind.
The main characters are beautifully acted, and fans of Watts, Penn, and Del Toro will not be disappointed.  The movie loses it's appeal in it's presentation:  beginning at the end, then jumping back and forth in time and perspective, it is extremely difficult to follow for the first half hour.  The viewer is forced to hold on for the ride, hoping everything will sort itself out and make sense at some point (which it does).  Overall a good to very good movie for mature audiences.

1988095,1,B0001CNRRU,"There are plenty of reviews here that relate the storyline, so I just want to mention two things about this movie that will affect your decision on whether to watch it or not.
First, this movie is VERY depressing.  It's about death, disease, and the destruction of lives.  If you think you're subjected to enough of that stuff out here in the real world, don't watch it!
Second, this movie is not linear.  It jumps around A LOT, and you will probably not fully understand where everything ties in until at least halfway through.  It is NOTHING like Memento.  That movie, while backwards, was linear, and after the first few scenes, it was easy to figure out the method.  If you're like me and lose interest easily, you probably won't finish 21 Grams.
I know a lot of people liked this film, but these are two very strong factors you should consider before you spend your money or time on this one.",1079481600,15,897,4.506172839506172

Benecio Del Toro was also amazing, even more so here than in TRAFFIC. His character was probably the most complex and you could really connect with him in a way.
If you like films that put you through an emotional rollercoaster and twist your mind thrice times a million times, I'd recommend this.

1988098,4,B0001CNRRU,"21 grams is a movie that tells us what life really means, or I should say how much the notion of being alive occupies in your bodies.

We live in fact to frogive, to hope and to repent.

Jack Jordon (Benici Del Toro), an ex-con who submits his life to the hand of God after being a diverse criminal in his adolescene. Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a wife who has just lost her husband her beloved daughters in a car accident. The movie belends the lives of these three people together and try to weigh the notion of living in two hours. The editing and cinematography, or even the narrative techniques remind me of the postmodern detective movie, Memento. The acting of the actors and actresses in the movie really stir up a chemical effect in the weighing process. This movie is highly recommended to those who like drama and have been searching for the meaning of life.

However, it does force the viewers to actively think and try to make sense of what they are presented with.  A horrific car accident brings the lives of the three characters together. Paul, the dying maths professor, becomes obsessed with the wife of the architect(Cristina)whose heart was transplanted to him.  His love for Cristina almost drives him to commit murder, but being a dying man himself, he has a much deeper understanding of what death means than Cristina. Cristina, who has a reckless past asscciated with illicit drug use, decompensates in the face of intense grief following the loss of her husband and two daughters. She becomes irrational,self-neglecting,uses drugs again,is full of anger and is obsessed with revenge. Jack, an ex-con man and a re-born Christian, is overwhelmed by guilt and anger towards God for his betrayal of him, after he has accidentally killed Cristina's husband and two daughters.

Then the actors (Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, and Naomi Watts) came into view and I was just extatic I knew it was something to watch. The film hit's you from the minute it starts to the moment it finishes. I caught the last show when I went and took some friends with me - they (seriously) had to throw us out because we couldn't find the feeling to get up from our seats, it left us numb and truely speechless.

It's deep and I know some people can't handle deep storytelling but it's a must see for anyone looking to be affected. So I recommend see it and if you like, recommend to everyone. I applaud the director and writer once again for a beautiful job well done.

'21 Grams' power lies in it's acting, no lie there. Sure, it does have some kind of twist like 'Memento,' however, '21 Grams' is a much better film for many diffrent reasons. The main one: the acting. Benecio Del Toro lights up the screen as Jack. Some of his most powerful acting ever. If you thought his performance in 'Traffic' was powerful, you haven't seen nothing yet. Naomi Watts turns in a solid performance as a grieving widow, who loses both her spouse and her two children. Sean Penn turns in another Oscar-caliber performance as a terminally ill math professor, whose own life is in termoil with a unhappy marriage.

1988102,2,B0001CNRRU,"First off, it's becoming rather tiring these days to see that any director aspiring to make an ""artsy"" film resorts to the non-linear direction. To clear up any misunderstandings in advance, there's nothing wrong per se with using this technique. But there should be a point to it: there should either be a clever twist hiding behind all the back and forths or the choice of going non-linear should make the film more entertaining in an obvious way. But in ""21 grams"" neither of these objectives is achieved. There is no twist and had this story been told linearly the result (positive or negative) would've been exactly the same.
  But  there's actually more working against ""21 grams"" than for it: throughout the whole film i was left wondering about what the premise is. Is it a film about death? One about god? One about fate, synchronicity and the ""chancy"" lives we lead? One about the complexity of human emotions? Or is it actually a film about life as lived by humans and the bizzare or ""funny"" choices they make?
  The problem is that it's a bit of everything with other touches thrown in for good measure. This problem becomes more annoying when you consider that all these themes (non exluded) are important and vast enough to make a film on its own for each. If you have 2 hours at your disposal to directorily ""comment"" on all of them you wind up with a film that says -ultimately- not much but which SEEMS to be saying a lot. But when you try to accurately answer the question ""what is the message or the premise"" they're conveying at us here you cant come up with a pinpointing answer.
  This is basically the equivalent of a film as if it had been made by a trickster. Loads of tricks to impress those only with eyes, but very little for those that employ cerebrum function with eye movement: the non-linear depiction, the fact that a variety of highly unlikely tragedies are thrown together, tied hastingly in a plot that doesn't go in any particular direction and finished off with tons of overacting to compensate for the inadequacy of the plot.
  It's not all a bleak sum though. The acting (overacting as it was) is indeed good, because in a perverse way this was the only thing that could've saved this film. Every actor here does his best to elevate this ""not much"" into ""something"" and in the end it's the performances that stay with you, not the movie itself.
  Speaking of a weak plot i could ask many questions, but I'll ask only one because precisely this question made it a ""miss"" for me in a definite way: in the film the character of N.Watts finds out that the man she's started an affair with is actually the recipient of her husbands heart. Yet she ""marrily"" goes on with the affair after only a small tantrum that lasts a mere few hours. Exactly what are the odds of that is what i'd really like to know.. Not only that, but only shortly before, during the funeral of her loved ones she declares that she doesnt want to even press charges against the guy responsible and yet, as a complete and unexplained transformation takes place, she winds up wanting to murder him. Go figure.
  To sum it all up, this will easily be a film that'll be widely praised, because people tend to be stunned when they are visually impressed even if there's no premise hidden under the spectacle. It's an old trick in the art of movie-making, it has worked 1000 times before and will work another 1000 times in the future. It's in fact a trick that works in many other levels of life just as effectively.
  Knowing that I'm totally going against the tide here with what I've said, i'll say also this: this film tries to be uncharacteristic of Hollywood and yet it manages to be flawed in the way many Hollywood films are: loads of eye-candy but precious little else. Lastly, this trivia about the 21 grams in the end had to do with what exactly anywhere in the film? Oh well, i could go on and on but the point is made.

In 21 grams Gonzalez Inarritu excels past his 1st feature film Amores Perros.  Although Amores Perros was a breakthrough of creativity in film it did not  grab a hold on my mind and my heart like 21 grams does.  Inarritu takes the idea of film making he used in Amores Perros and puts it to a story that should touch anyone that walks this earth.  The movie is a social commentary on the fear of death, the coping with death, and being able to cope with the fact that this world is a place of chance and freak things, but that everyone musst go through this and be able to handle it.  Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro are the standouts of the movie.  Naomi Watts is stellar at times, but at other times it seemed that she was overacting.  The first hour of 21 grams is some of the best film making that I have seen in some time, but the ladder 45 minutes seem to be a bit stretched out at times.  Overall though the movie is one of the years ten best, which usually results in a pretty stellar film.

Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's film however, takes a vacation from that format, asking us to confront the coincidences and tragedies of real everyday life.  Truth is indeed stranger than fiction, and although ""21 Grams"" is fictional, it is closer to real life for some than anything else around.
Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts in particular are outstanding, while Sean Penn does admirably in his role as a well-meaning compassionate man whose own life is in flux.  Inarritu's cameraman, Rodrigo Prieto is instrumental to the pulse of this somber, thrilling, intimate and unforgettable work.

1988115,4,B0001CNRRU,"I hate those reviews of ""eclectic"" films that not only gush about how great the picture was, but take the time to belittle anyone who doesn't 'get it.'
This is one of those films... but not one of those reviews. In fact, I'll offer a cautionary statement of a sort: If you couldn't stand ""Memento"" because of the fact that is runs (kind of) in reverse, then you might want to avoid ""21 Grams."" And I won't think you're either stupid, or a bad person.
To continue with the ""Memento"" comparison, if ""Memento"" was like a ladder, in which the film started at the top, went down two rungs, climbed up one, stepped down two, climbed up one... and so on; then ""21 Grams"" is more like snippets of a slow-motion explosion. In reverse. And your job is to figure out what it is that exploded.
I'll admit that my initial reaction to the discordant pace of the film was rather negative. But eventually, enough pieces start to come together that it all begins to make sense. And of course, the acting is superb... so even when I did feel rather confused about what was going on, I could at least enjoy the performances.
Others have pointed out that it's almost impossible to give a synopsis of this film without giving away too much. In brief, Sean Penn plays a desparately-ill man who is very unhappily married to an English woman. Naomi Watts is a very happily married mother of two young girls, and Benicio del Toro (who won an Oscar for his role), plays a born-again, bible-quoting, fundamentalist, ex-con.
How these people's lives become completely intertwined could have been done in the standard chronological way... but in the end, I thought that sometimes being able to see a little bit (and sometimes quite far) into the future, made for a fascinating film.",1078099200,,1753,4.603833865814696
1988116,4,B0001CNRRU,"Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu received an Academy Award nomination for his first film, Amores Perros, in which three short stories were linked by a devastating road accident. Once again, with ""21 Grams"", like the first film written by Guillermo Arriaga, several lives are linked by a devastating accident. Here though the stories of the individual characters are much more interconnected than they were in the previous film.
Who are those characters? Well there's Sean Penn as college professor Paul Rivers, who is suffering from heart failure and will soon die unless a heart transplant can be found. There's the professor's wife Mary (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg) who has problems conceiving, but who wants to have an operation so she can conceive his child by artificial insemination if he does die. Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a woman who was previously addicted to drugs but who's managed to put her life in order since marrying architect Michael (Danny Huston) and giving birth to two daughters. And there are the ex-convict Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) and his wife Marianne (Melissa Leo). Jack has found religion, and his new sense of belief is helping him to go straight and raise their two children, even if it does at times have a less than positive effect on his parenting skills.
All these are fragile lives, and all of these main characters are walking on thin ice. Some are more aware of it than others until a tragic accident makes it all too clear to everyone just how thin that ice is. It also connects them all in new and even tragic ways. I really don't want to give too much of the plot away, because piecing it together is much of the joy of the film. It's also much of the challenge, because - as with Amores Perros - Inarritu doesn't present the story in chronological order.
The first image we see is Paul naked on the bed and watching Christina as she sleeps. Chronologically this occurs long after the accident that brings them together. Then we move on to sequences in which he is near to death, then apparently healthier, then wandering hopelessly and breathlessly in a desert-like landscape with a gun in his hand. At times, you have little more to guide you with regard to the chronology than the physical characteristics of the characters, including facial hair.
As with Amores Perros, Inarritu once again adopts a deliberately grainy and unglamorous shooting style, which is - as before - provided by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto. You don't appear in an Inarritu film if you have a trace of physical vanity. Naomi Watts looked glamorous and stunning in ""Mulholland Drive"". In 21 Grams no one gets that chance. Make-up is minimal, lighting is often much less than flattering.
In some ways I preferred ""21 Grams"" to ""Pulp Fiction"", which also consisted of short stories put together out of chronological order. One reason for that preference was the grungier reality of Inarritu's visuals, and the fact that they contrasted in interesting ways with the overall complexity of the story.
Sometimes - it has to be said - in both films, the anti-chronological structure, the grungy cinematography, and the excellence of the performances, does cover what could easily be melodramatic excess. If the story of ""21 Grams"" were told straightforwardly with less powerful actors, it could almost be an over the top TV soap-opera.
The performances are a large part of what makes the film so stunning. All of the main actors excel. Several of them won awards at the 2003 Venice International Film Festival - Sean Penn receiving Best Actor, and Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts receiving the Audience Awards for Best Actor and Actress. Penn gives a very different performance here than he did in ""Mystic River"", although this film contains some elements of that one, and even of ""The Crossing Guard"" and ""In the Bedroom"". Naomi Watts has been nominated for a thoroughly deserved Academy Award (which she probably won't get) for Best Actress, and del Toro nominated for Best Supporting Actor. ""21 Grams"" also contains a powerful cameo from Clea DuVall as Christina's younger sister.
So why is it called 21 Grams? Well that's said by some to be the weight of the human soul. Inarritu is examining what happens to individuals when confronted by events beyond their control, and asking questions about birth, love, death and religion. It's a gripping film and one with strong themes. Well worth a viewing, but I warn you that it does demand active participation on the part of the viewer.",1077753600,7,4518,4.891786179921773
1988117,5,B0001CNRRU,"At the core of ""21 Grams"" is a story of three human beings who are facing the most horrifying and difficult situations a human being could possibly face. To portray these characters, the powers that be recruited three of the finest film actors working today, as well as a talented director smart enough to get out of their way. The result is (not surprisingly) a powerful, gripping film.

This film is not easy to watch. These characters are going through hell. Naomi Watts portrays a grief-stricken woman whose husband and two daughters are all killed in a hit-and-run. Sean Penn plays the heart-transplant patient who receives her husband's heart, and finds hiimself living with a strange combination of gratitude, guilt and terror. Benecio Del Toro is the born-again Christian and former convict who accidently killed the family, and is tormented by guilt and rage. Watching Watts, Penn, and Toro tackle these characters is truly magnificent, but also heartwrenching. Rage, guilt, heartbreak, suffering, need, empathy, fear, hatred, love, lust, hope ... these characters showcase humanity at its most raw. There seems to be some debate about the affectiveness of the non-linear way their stories are told, but I thought it worked beautifully. All in all, a terrific film.",1077148800,3,1274,5.154589371980676
1988118,1,B0001CNRRU,"This film depicts death, faith, and revenge, but does little to unravel the complexities of these themes.  It is as if the film-makers recognise these to be 'profound' topics, sturdy enough to provide pivots upon which a plot might turn, but have not thought about their subjects deeply - certainly not deeply enough to open them up for an audience's meditation.
*
The technique of splintering a plot into a chronological puzzle is ably handled in the first hour.  By exploiting our hunger for a coherent narrative, the film draws one in - however, after being asked to do some work, a viewer expects a commensurable reward, in terms of character development or surprise in plot structure or depth of ideas, and here the film disappoints.  The plot relies on chance, the characters border on the cliched, and the ideas own a superficial suggestiveness without deeper riches. So the last hour becomes tedious, and with the splintering over, the linear plot is revealed as poorly motivated in parts.
*
The cinematic effects are skilled, at times spectacular, but as they do not subserve the demands of the story, they draw attention to themselves, in a showy, at times, irritating manner.  The director seems at pains to prove his own worth.
*
The acting has been widely praised, and in a sense it is deserving.  The director's intentions appear admirably fulfilled, and the actors display a wide range of emotions - if only these intentions had been better thought through, then the emotions might well have resonated more lastingly.  As it is, the film is more a spectacle than a meditation, an entertainment rather than art, and its detail is quickly forgotten.
*
Make no mistake, this is not the work of a major director.  At best, Inarritu might stand alongside Tarantino.  He has aspired to work with the American studios and has succeeded in measuring up to their standards.",1077062400,9,1879,4.868338557993731
1988119,4,B0001CNRRU,"""They say we all loose 21 GRAMS when we die.

The film is not for the faint of the heart, for director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu takes you, with his camera, to the darkest spots of humanity, but the acting is so incredibly strong and the screenwriting so sharp, you can't help but be entertained and enthralled by this definitive slice-of-life drama/thriller.",1076284800,4,898,5.115646258503402
1988120,5,B0001CNRRU,"My life's been awash in the pull of momentous turning tides, and I've faced countless daunting crises- The moment was boasting nighttime and quite frigid, (-7, actually: well amid the depths of one of the harshest Midwest winters immemorial).  I went alone to see this film.
Riveted to the screen, I was witness to raw nature and circumstance; I was witness to stark fate.  Driving home the premise that it's pure ordained destiny that both joins human souls and tears them from each other, this movie is just devastating.  Yet I had already sensed that this would be one of those rare films that tend to disturb the senses to a degree that sets the mind to thinking - haunting one's days and nights for weeks and months to come.  Yes, by my troth I do live dangerously!
21 GRAMS tells the story of three troubled yet essentially good people whose lives become deeply connected through a horrific accident: Paul Rivers (Sean Penn), an unhappily married and terminally ill mathematician who's in desperate need of a heart transplant - Christina Peck (Naomi Watts), a former drug addict who's since become wife of an architect and mother of two children - and Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro), a former convict become a born-again Christian, who's rebuilding his life with his wife, Marianne (Melissa Leo), and their two little children.  One fateful evening on the way home, Jack's truck collides with Christina's husband, Michael (Danny Huston), and her two daughters- killing all three.  Paul then gets an 11th-hour reprieve from death - as he becomes the recipient of Michael's heart. While he recovers from the transplant, he becomes obsessed with finding, and then getting to know, Christina- the living victim of the devastating tragedy that had served to give him this new lease on life.  Meanwhile, Jack is tortured and wracked by guilt - he had panicked and left the scene of the accident.  Despite the pleading protests of his wife, he turns himself in to police. (Melissa Leo. incidentally, is excellent as Jack's devoted & strong-willed wife, who in one scene is worked up into a passion reminiscent of Shakespeare's Lady MacBeth). It's the three leads, in fact, who turn out one of the most intense, outstanding dramatic performances by a cast I've ever seen.  Penn, Toro, and Watts each put forth heart-wrenching depictions of grief, despair, love and rage. They were riveting to watch.
Director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu is at the helm of this film, and he deserves significant credit too.  The movie's shot with a sort of raw, gritty and real-to-life imagery, but sequenced non-chronologically and without much music. Furthermore, there's quite a lot of grainy artifact and symbolism present, harshly imbuing the sounds, the words and the images with an ominous gloom. It might indeed be easy to fathom that any film with such qualities embedded would ultimately surmount to a rather morose, distracting, and basically disjointed mess. Yet somehow this film's neither imposingly heavy nor wholly depressing. On the contrary, 21 GRAMS is a subtly beautiful, powerfully atmospheric, and hypnotically captivating work of art~",1076112000,164,3134,5.044487427466151
1988121,5,B0001CNRRU,"Everything about this film is beautiful and superb. All three stars give amazing performances. Del Toro's best role since 'Dr. Gonzo', in ""Fear & Loathing"". Sean Penn is great as usual, and Naomi Watts is to brilliant for words.
'21 Grams' is a story of three stories...all connected in a way. It resembles PT Anderson's work in ""Magnolia"" (connection wise), and Tarantino's work in ""Reservoir Dogs"" & ""Pulp Fiction"" (plot sequence wise).
Five stars is the only rating you could give this film. Go see it and you'll love it. The best film that I've seen in 2004 so far.",1075593600,2,569,4.7
1988122,4,B0001CNRRU,"""21 Grams"" demands your attention from the opening scene. The movie is edited in a non-linear fashion-think Quentin Tarantino-and each of the many scenes is one tiny piece of a very big puzzle.
Eventually you grasp the story lines of the major characters. Sean Penn plays a Mathematics professor. He's a cynic and a philanderer with a bad heart. Literally. He is awaiting a transplant. Naomi Watts plays a beautiful suburban mother, a former druggie and party girl, who now loves her family deeply. Benico del Toro plays a troubled man, an ex-con with a bad temper, who now relies on Jesus to keep him straight.
A traumatic event causes these three lives to interesect with tragic consequences. I won't say more because I don't want to spoil the movie.
The actors are all outstanding. The three leads amaze you. The supporting cast also boasts powerful performances. Melissa Leo plays del Toro's wife, a Lady Macbeth in a trailer park. Charlotte Gainsbourg, the English actress, plays Penn's wife, a woman desperate to have a baby at all costs even if her husband won't be there to see the child grow up.
I appreciated the use of the non-linear technique. However, I believe that it may have failed the movie towards the end. Certain actions taken by Penn and Watt's characters don't necessarily make sense. As we have not seen these characters develop, we don't understand how they get to certain points of desparation.
Still it is an outstanding movie.  I would recommend it to individuals who gravitate towards serious, thoughtful, ""art-house"" films. It will leave you thinking about a number of issues for days.",1075507200,2,1615,4.894160583941606
