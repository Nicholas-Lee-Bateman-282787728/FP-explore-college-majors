8178563,4,B00004Y7H2,The Movie stars Meng Fei. Their are three friends and one tricks and betrays the other two for the Ching government. One of the two that is betrayed has two young sons who get rescued by a monk. The boys are seperated one becomes a snake expert and works as a Ching guard the other becomes a crane expert and lives at the Temple. Both boys eventually join together and with others in order to get revenge on the man who killed their father and is now high up in the Ching ranks. The movie in my opinion deserves a 4 star rating for the simple fact that it does great justice in its demonstrations of the snake and crane styles. It also has a solid kung fu movie plot and good actors. I think it is a definate must see movie if you like kung fu movies that demonstrate the annimal styles.,1036022400,,787,4.150326797385621
