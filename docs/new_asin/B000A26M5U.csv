8072377,5,B000A26M5U,"The Jews of the South get short shrift in most of big media most of the time. They don't conveniently fit into the stereotypes or the preferred narratives. So this documentary is a revelation, as well as a thoughtful history of the 1,500 or so at their peak in the Mississippi Delta. Now (well, 11 years ago) they've dwindled to 300 or less. Most of their children are going to college out of state and staying away. Synagogues are sadly being shuttered.

Wonderful interviews here. Many store owners, but also some cotton farmers and professionals, with such telling remarks from a few as to how they relate more to Delta Christians than to Northern Jews. Makes sense. And all the people interviewed speaking in that wonderful, deep Mississippi brogue. A good reminder as someone said in another context that life is more complicated than we think. Perhaps than we can think.",1264377600,7,876,4.801324503311259
