2936341,5,B000VCF318,"Catharien McRay is wonderful as a fitness instructor!  I thoroughly enjoyed working along with this video.  Very thorough and the results?  I just got over an auto accident, went soooo many times to the chiropractor and for what they called rehabilitative therapy that i could hardly stand it.  Bought this DVD, started to work through it and found that within just days my tenderness, inflammation, swelling, soreness and difficult range-of-motion had gotten better.  I'm on my way to ""better"" now, and I give the credit to this wonderfully therapeutic fitness routine.",1354320000,19,570,5.21978021978022
2936342,5,B000VCF318,Gentle fitness is a wonderful exercise video for anyone who suffers from fibromyalgia. I noticed an immediate benefit in mood and range of motion.,1352332800,13,146,5.125
2936343,5,B000VCF318,"I am a social worker and I bought this video for my seniors. They absolutely love it and although I have 5 other different videos, this one is their favorite.",1334534400,16,158,4.3
2936344,4,B000VCF318,"I ordered this DVD as a Christmas gift for my sedentary mother-in-law so I don't know yet whether it is a good purchase; however, I am hopeful.",1323734400,,143,4.333333333333333
2936345,5,B000VCF318,"I've enjoyed this workout for many years, and have never tired of it.  It seems to employ every move I've ever met in my limited experience with physical therapy, and seems to stretch and strengthen every muscle in the body.  Leaves one feeling invigorated and relaxed.  I don't easily get down on the floor anymore, so just use the first four portions, taking about 50 minutes to complete.  One can do more, or choose to do fewer segments.  Mine came with a little booklet explaining what exercises work what, which, especially in the beginning,can be useful. Highly recommended.",1322784000,32,580,4.877551020408164
2936346,4,B000VCF318,"I bought this video for a friend who has Parkinson's disease.  He actually said that some of the exercises are almost too easy, which is a real switch from most exercise videos.  I like that there are several different routines and that you can choose which one you feel up to that day, and he is using it.  I would be tempted to give it 5 stars, but I have not used it myself.",1303084800,4,377,4.0675675675675675
2936347,2,B000VCF318,"Following a recommendation, I bought this DVD to aid me (a senior) in becoming more fit without hurting myself. I'm sure this is an excellent fitness program - if you have a physical handicap, chronic illness or disability. It is a limited exercise program and perhaps needs to be described as that to prevent other seniors from buying it who want a thorough overall workout program. While doing it the first (& only) time I felt I should be at least 20 years older (very elderly!) or seriously injured or disabled.  Very disapointing & waste of money for me.",1267228800,17,559,4.646464646464646
2936348,5,B000VCF318,"This is a very easy workout that seems to get just about every muscle in my body moving.  I call it my ""old lady video"" because it is so easy yet when I am feeling achy and sore, I almost always feel much better after I do the exercises.  It has several levels and it takes quite a while to do all of them, so I just do what I have time to do.  You can skip from one section or level to the other.",1244764800,25,397,3.6470588235294117

2936354,5,B000VCF318,"Ordered this for my mom in her 90s who struggles with arthritis but is still active. She LOVES it! It is perfect! It keeps her moving, feeling proactive and yet doesn't let her feel left behind because there are so many options offered during the class.

2936357,4,B000VCF318,"I have a few conditions keeping me from exercising traditionally. This DVD is very helpful for people with injuries or debilities that prevent them from standing while working out. It has several selections of routines and a booklet full of information. I love her gentle disposition and encouraging smile.

2936359,5,B000VCF318,"This exercise DVD is one of the best I""ve ever come across.
The leader is clear and easy to follow, as well as being positive and very upbeat.
The routines exercise all parts of the body, and it doesn't matter what your fitness level is.
It's a seated routine, all of them are, and it's fabulous.",1384300800,2,296,4.303571428571429

2936363,3,B000VCF318,"I am an overweight and out-of-shape senior who benefited from this video. Doing the exercises made me feel stronger, more relaxed and more energetic.  However, the music is so bad and so boring that I find myself reluctant to use the video . . . and I have just ordered a different chair exercise DVD.",1371772800,6,301,4.472727272727273

2936368,5,B000VCF318,"Mrs. McCrea is so gentle in leading this group of individuals through a series of  effective excercises. Her admission that she suffered from MS gave me so much confidence. I have Stasis Dermatitis in both legs from the knees down. This has left them stiff and hard to move my joints. I also have Arthritis and my knees are not at all flexible. However, I feel that as I continue these gentle exercises, I will soon be able to do these moves. I am unable to walk and the doctors don't have a diagnosis. I believe these exercises will aid in my weight loss and perhaps even allow me to walk once more. I am familiar with many exercise videos, and this is the best one I have ever seen because I can feel the stretching in my body and know how good all this is for me.",1358467200,14,766,4.175675675675675

8218023,5,B000VCF318,"The recipient of this gift enjoyed the DVD a lot. This was a gentle introduction to stretching and chair yoga, ideal for a person wanting to get back into fitness and has arthritis. The production quality is not  a high budget ""Hollywood"" quality by any means, but it isn't awful either and the sound is audible.",1503619200,,312,4.571428571428571

8218025,4,B000VCF318,"This is a decent enough DVD...more a fan of the ones by stronger senior....esp if you hate exercise like I do but you get to use most of your muscles wo being overtaxed. I have developed hip bursitis so my walks have been curtailed for the time being and needed something to do till I can start that up again. It is all stretching and mostly from a chair which I also prefer with the hip and some back issues. If you do this everyday I think you'd notice some changes in flexibility and movement. Just to use not very often not so much. I do about five days a week. I don't always do every segment either which is nice. Not a fan of all her unecessary hand movements and shots of the people doing the exercises, would rather see how she does them all the time. And I might remind people who think this is mostly for handicapped people that any time your muscles are being used you burn calories so yes this is all stretching but muscles are used. I've lost nine lbs with this and diet also of course recently so if you keep it up it does work. I might also suggest to people to watch exercise videos on YouTube before purchasing, many are on there so you get an idea of what you are getting",1486339200,2,1190,4.1558441558441555
