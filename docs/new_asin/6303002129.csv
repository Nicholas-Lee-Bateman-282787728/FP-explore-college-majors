7833465,1,6303002129,"This whole series is a serious waste of your resources.  It's possible to learn how to dance with DVDs and tapes, but these are not the instructors you want to utilize.  Keep searching.",1114819200,2,185,4.575757575757576
7833466,1,6303002129,"I ordered these tapes based on another review and the cost and expected to learn a few new figures from them but was sorely disappointed!  I should have saved my money!  I studied ballroom dance for about 1 1/2 years in college and competed in a few competitions but I was definitely still at beginner level!  The most important thing a person can learn when beginning ballroom dancing is FORM!  It doesn't matter how many figures you know, if your form is poor you will look like (and be) a terrible dancer! You will also not be a very good partner.  These videos don't even address form, carriage, leading, proper handholds and the cha-cha was done on the wrong rythm (the ""cha-cha"" part is to be done on the four and one not the two and three)  The woman in the video wasn't wearing heels which completely affects how the steps are done.  Although the videos were labeled int. and adv. and taught two Latin dances, they didn't even address or use cuban motion which is important in the Latin dances.  Even though the videos were a good price, it is better to spend a little extra money and learn the correct way so you can partner anyone anywhere you go.  Nick Felix's dance magic tapes are much better and address the key issues of form and carriage. As my college dance coach always said, it is better to do two or three figures and the basic for each dance well than do six or seven poorly!",1043280000,24,1396,4.400778210116732
7833467,5,6303002129,"You can't go wrong with this video. I'm a relatively new dancer, but a quick study and easily bored. The instructor takes you through the steps thouroughly and clearly. He doesn't spend a great deal of time on technique, but then this is an intermediate lesson. He demonstrates the steps with his back to the camera (why doesn't everybody do this?) when possible, so you don't have to translate left/right and direction, and learn at the same time. With an explantion of about 5 or 6 steps per dance you can take a new routine out on the dance floor and not feel like you're just doing the same old basic step over and over. At six bucks for the tape, you're paying about 35 cents for each move. Where are you going to find a better deal?",1017792000,30,738,4.355072463768116
