Konrath.

Talon: I saw the tittle, and instantly knew this was going to be the best worst movie ever.

Watching it proved me right.

I know it's a cult classic based on being absolutely terrible, and I know it's a bad movie, but I rate movies on how much enjoyment I get outta them. I couldn't stop laughing because the producers actually stole STAR WARS footage and shot new scenes over it. Maybe the plot doesn't make any sense, maybe the acting is bad, maybe the fight scenes are repetitive, but I found all of that hilarious.

I think that's all that matters.

And for a terrible movie, this had a lot of action and conflict, and the main actor Cuneyt Arkin is like Turkey's Tom Cruise, so I can't hate on that.

No headaches were formed during the viewing of this movie, only endless laughter.

Joe: I first saw this back in my VHS tape trading days. It was epic then. It remains epic.

Talon: Here's some of the dialogue my dad and I had while viewing. Try to imagine some of our phrases as catchy slogans:

""Is that the Millennium Falcon?""
""I don't think they paid the licensing fee.""

""It's like STAR WARS. Only Turkish... And horrible.""

""The Turkish name for this is"" The Man Who Saved The World."" But who's going to save me from this movie?""

""I can't think of a better movie that I'm watching right now.""

""He's jumping on the trampoline again...""
""He's hopping mad.""

""I wish I was that cool.""
""No, you don't.""

""Holy cow there's a sequel.""
""Shut up and take my money!""

""My favorite part is when we see stolen STAR WARS footage.""
""Maybe it isn't stolen. Maybe George Lucas loaned it. I heard he's very good at relinquishing creative control.""

""I don't think those are real rocks.""
""You've lost your childhood sense of whimsy.""",1493596800,,2138,5.372372372372372
8546887,1,B00A6ERTFO,"this 'film' is very strange indeed. it has lots of the same star wars footage littered throughout it with random snatches of Indiana jones theme music added as well. like star wars itself there is virtually no coherent storyline to propel the action.

there is a 'cantina' scene with appropriate menagerie of 'other worldly' patrons, except not in half-passable costumes like in star wars, these ones just adorn colored sheets. it would be funny if it were reasonably good, but un/fortunately it is just laughable.

if you enjoy aimless stories with no actual point you'll love this. other than that it's a great film.",1457395200,,618,4.9326923076923075
8546888,5,B00A6ERTFO,"Like Japan envying the west for developing Television cartoons and needing their own animated entertainment, so did Turkey when the west created the sensation and culture defying trilogy known as STAR WARS. What makes the disaster a disasterpiece? It's the fact it's so poorly done yet so obviously ripping off so much from other things it's too good to pass up. Like cult classic 'The Room', it's enjoyed because of it's lucrative amounts of open plot holes and bland writing and endless jokes. This is no exception, in this film you'll see a man obviously do trampoline type jumps in order to achieve cool ""boulder smashing action"", you'll also see him rip arms off and single handedly karate chop rocks in half and spontaneously exploding. There's a good amount of fight scenes where actual horses are used(eat your heart out Hobbit movies) - You'll see lettuce being used for medicinal purposes, and tons of toilet paper mummies! There's also a scene where im willing to bet at least 30 actors in really awful monster costumes stock pile into a very narrow cave passage which is pure amazing-sauce. The soundtrack is gold, and i mean gold since it was mostly composed by John Williams. And the sound/audio engineering is so so so bad, it'll make you laugh if nothing else can. The music is choppy, skippy, and when it comes to background music in the fight scenes the sound effects overlap the scores in such a way where it causes a brief  crackle due to the special effects being louder than the background music, causing a blow out. It's artistic with how badly it's done.

10/10 classic",1453852800,3,1593,4.768115942028985
