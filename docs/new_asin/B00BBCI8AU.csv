8565262,5,B00BBCI8AU,"A great tribute to old style B movies.  Action, adventure, guns, and good looking women.  Lots of great one-liners.  Yes, it's a cheap movie, but keep watching.  This is a great flick to watch with a bunch of people, and good food and drinks.  You'll laugh, you'll laugh some more.  Just keep watching.  Forget about computer generated imagery and watch a real film.  Great direction in an indie film.",1395619200,3,401,4.7101449275362315
8565263,5,B00BBCI8AU,I really enjoyed this film.  True this film was shot on a tight budget but it delivers a bang on the level of a larger budget film.  Many of the indies I have seen are hard for me to watch.  This one is fun and edgy.  I love Johnny V's glib remarks and one liners.  Angel hanging out of her costume is encouraging.  The Mayor has a unique view on the cultures.  You have to catch Johnny V's Christmas story towards the end.  I give this grindhouse action flick 5 stars.  Mutt Productions got the formula right on this one.,1382054400,3,522,4.14
8565264,3,B00BBCI8AU,"Ok, this was obviously shot for like $7,000 and whatever they could pull out of the couch cushions, but honestly it looks pretty good for that, more like $100,000. And one of the best lines I have ever heard in an action movie: "" I need you to fill this bag with guns.""",1379635200,4,269,4.09433962264151
8565265,5,B00BBCI8AU,Enjoy!  Its a satirical Grindhouse film in the style of the late seventies and early eighties.  Good Tex Mex shootem up.,1379030400,2,120,4.666666666666667
8565266,5,B00BBCI8AU,"Every 1 needs to check this flick out! Listening to the haters reviews? Man, that would be like a waste of time..
I had this movie shipped to my condo in Sherman Oaks, CA. Me and 3 female coworkers ordered up a veggie pizza and watched it one night after a photo shoot. Man.. This flix got mad gunz blazing all the time, a bomb soundtrack, and some ridiculously ill talent. I was laughing my butt off, my ladies couldn't hardly breathe because of laughing, lets just say it was a good Sunday funday :) between us all, 8 THUMBS UP!",1377475200,6,530,4.257425742574258
8565267,5,B00BBCI8AU,The last 20 minutes were so action packed. It was like wait did that just happen?!?! Oh no he did not just shoot that many guys?!? The punch bowl humor is funny. Watch out Hollywood...a star is born!,1373068800,6,199,4.2631578947368425
8565268,5,B00BBCI8AU,I mean the movie is shot beautifully. The main character Johnny V is hilarious and gritty. I don't think these other reviews gave the movie a chance. Good job Johnny v....look for to the trilogy!,1373068800,7,195,4.6
