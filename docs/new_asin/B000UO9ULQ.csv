2923409,5,B000UO9ULQ,"I rushed to order a copy of ""Westinghouse"" for my father after I reviewed it for a magazine published by the director's alma mater.  My dad is a real challenge when it comes to gifts or trying to entertain him.  He may not have gone to the office since retiring 22 years ago, but he will always be an industrial engineer--not a sportsman, not a golfer, not a tinkerer around the house--an industrial strength engineer and if there was ever a hero for that kind of soul, it is George Westinghouse.

You need not be an octogenarian authority on warehouse palletization to enjoy this documentary that profiles America's most prolific inventor and industrialist who was gifted with good business sense and a generous heart. It is accessibly crafted to hold general interest for anyone. The producers and director have assembled extraordinary images and facts about the man whose career began during the Civil War before he was even twenty and carried America into the 20th century.  The documentary looks at the larger landscapes of the railroad and rise of factories and peers into the American home as all were revolutionized by Westinghouse's vision.  Those who enjoy the history of World's Fairs and expositions will be gratified by footage from several of them.  Westinghouse is an American hero on many counts, not the least that he was a generous employer who inspired an unparalleled depth of worker loyalty in an era when union violence was the norm elsewhere.  It is to the credit of the makers of the documentary that they let the historical facts and images show the greatness; they do not overdress it with a boastful or maudlin narrative.

This runs nearly 2 hours and never bogs down.  Additionally, there are interviews and other historical perspectives available in the extra features.",1214179200,37,1798,4.927152317880795

The cover shows Tesla, who did play a great part in Westinghouse's electrical success, but is only a small part of what George accomplished. He fits in the same category as Gates and Buffet in giving his money away. And in Westinghouse's time that was much rarer. Covers a lot of the behind the scenes history of the trials and tribulations he faced with rivals including Edison. Unlike Edison, Westinghouse did not seek the credit or glory that came from all his employees. Nor did he do everything to enrich himself.

2923464,5,B000UO9ULQ,"This is a very detailed and insightful documentary on the life of George Westinghouse, inventor and business leader (founder of Westinghouse Electric, etc.). I gained a lot of insights into the early development of electrical power systems, Westinghouse's seeking out best solutions from others (alternating current, polyphase systems) and championing them. I had some understanding of the rivalry between Westinghouse and Edison, and this documentary provided a lot of additional details. Westinghouse's progressive treatment of his workers was detailed also.
The documentary starts with details of Westinghouse's childhood, his service in the Civil War, and early inventions (air brake, etc.), which helps to set the stage for his later accomplishments in electrical areas.
Toward the end of the documentary there is also a lot of interesting history presented on the changes in Westinghouse Electric in the 20th century and the marketing to a consumer culture.
One note: The still shot for this documentary prominently depicts Tesla, and although his involvement with Westinghouse is detailed, it is not a substantial part of the documentary.",1453075200,,1145,5.624277456647399

2923501,5,B000UO9ULQ,"George Westinghouse was an incredible industrialist who you may not be too familiar with. I certainly had no idea how prolific and impactful an inventor he was before watching this documentary.

Some of you may know that Westinghouse played a major role in inventing automatic air brakes for railroads and bringing them to a mass market. It is easy to under appreciate what a life-changing invention this was.

Passenger rail used to be the main mode of long-distance transportation in early Industrial America, and traveling by train entailed significant risks. Information on the condition of tracks was paltry by today's standards. Trains had no mechanism for quickly skidding to a halt if a coupling between cars broke, lines were damaged by weather or falling rocks or there was another train on the track due to a horrifying miscommunication. There were ghastly accidents in which passengers cars would get crushed like an accordion, making it impossible to identify the remains of all the people inside. Many people were terrified of riding the rails.

Railroads had brakes, but using them was not easy. The brakes on each car had to be activated individually to get the whole train to slow down. To do this, brakemen had to race along the roof of car to car on a moving train, quickly twisting heavy wheels before moving on to the next car. If the brakes were not applied in a coordinated fashion, trains would jostle, passengers and luggage would be thrown about, and the cars might even derail. Due to icy rooftops or sudden jolts, it was not uncommon for brakemen to tumble off the train during this critical activity. These unfortunate souls would surely fall to their death while leaving the passengers on the unstopped train to a worrisome fate. Being a brakeman was a dangerous job that could only be done by the very bravest of men.

George Westinghouse saved us from all this. He invented an automatic braking system that could be activated from within the safety of the interior of the cars. He also designed a chain that ran throughout the entire train, enabling an operator in one of the front locomotives to simultaneously engage the brakes on all cars at once. This invention surely saved countless lives and was a significant prerequisite for a thriving transportation sector. We can thank the transportation industry for making it possible for any of us to walk into a Walmart and have access to more goods than even the wealthiest of Americans would 100 years ago.

The invention of the air brake is just one of many, many magnificent inventions that Westinghouse helped develop and bring to a mass market. His advancements in electrical power distribution helped electrify the homes, cities, and offices of the masses. He helped electrify the railroads, allowing carriers to shift away from coal-fired locomotives. He invented the ""railroad frog"", a mechanism for allowing trains to smoothly switch tracks without requiring an army of super-strong men to lift railroad cars off one rail and prop them onto another. He invented electric railroad signals, which better informed train operators of railroad lines that were occupied or down, and prevented many horrific accidents. He invented new shutoff valves for domestic natural gas systems, allowing Americans to enjoy the many benefits of having natural gas for heating, illumination and cooking while substantially reducing the risk of getting blown up due to a gas leak.

Some business historians argue that Westinghouse has just as many inventions, if not more than Thomas Edison, if you count all of the patents awarded to people directly working for Westinghouse. Westinghouse's policy for intellectual property was evidently different from Edison's. Edison put his name on the patent of everything invented by people working for his company, as part of their employment agreement. Westinghouse did not even though he often still helped with the inventions (like Edison.) Even if Edison has still produced way more inventions than Westinghouse, Westinghouse still has an impressive record.

Westinghouse had such an active mind even in his final days when he was confined to a wheelchair. Supposedly, those who found him after he passed away also saw that he was sketching out some ideas for an electric wheelchair.

This documentary really helped me appreciate how Westinghouse is a great American who belongs in an industrialist hall of fame.",1425254400,4,4427,5.088154269972452

Suffice it to say most people won't be aware until they watch this movie what an important figure in American and world history Westinghouse is. Now I know. And it isn't just the Westinghouse museum that knows. Some other people might know too.

I don't know if it matters a lot that I know. I think Westinghouse's reward may be in heaven. He probably died a little young because God realized what a great guy he was and wanted him there.

2923564,4,B000UO9ULQ,"Westinghouse was a man with an ingrained talent for machinery. His inventions were essential in improving the quality of life well over a century ago, and these same innovations are indispensable to this day as well. His designs revolutionized railroad safety, and unlike many of his competitors, his dedicated efforts at getting them utilized was less about profit and more to prevent the common massive fatalities on the railroads caused by faulty braking systems. I found it fascinating to see that his air brake (which he patented at 22 years of age) is essentially the same model being used today, as are his shock absorbers for cars, transformers for generating efficient electrical currents into homes, and innumerable other devices we take for granted which were patented by this underrated intellect.

An interesting aspect brought to light by this documentary, which I was preciously unaware of, was the rivalry between Westinghouse and Edison, and how the former worked alongside Nikola Tesla to revolutionize alternating power. It was almost disturbing to see how ruthless Edison could be - at one instance in his rivalry with Westinghouse he utilized the new method of condemning criminals with Westinghouse's alternating currents in a smear campaign intended to associate a negative connotation to his business rival.

A good deal of high quality original film footage was used, and the narrative was highly absorbing. After his death, it did meander off to a feature on other products innovated by the company, though I felt this would have been better had it left off with the life and own inventions of Westinghouse. Still a great watch, and an excellent documentary about a man who was as much a great humanitarian as he was an engineering genius.",1376438400,5,1765,5.125

2923584,5,B000UO9ULQ,"Edison was doubtless a creative genius.  He was also a self-promoter, taking credit for others' work.  George Westinghouse was the real thing.  For example, Edison had over a thousand patents, while Westinghouse held only a third as many; but most of Edison's patents were due to employees whose work was patented in Edison's name.  Westinghouse's employees registered their patents in their own names.  If they had been credited in Edison's way, then Westinghouse's tally might well have surpassed Edison's.

Westinghouse invented the the railway air brake, which revolutionized transportation. Westinghouse brought to market the first electric railroad locomotive and the first useful large-scale dynamo. And, despite the opposition of Edison, Westinghouse and his friend Nikola Tesla made alternating current (AC) the means of electrical power transmission.

Westinghouse was also a model employer.  His thousands of workers -- blue and white collar -- loved him.  Samuel Gompers, the first great American union leader, said that if all employers were like Westinghouse, then there would be no need for unions.  To top it off, Westinghouse had a long and loving marriage and happy home life.  Unfortunately, Edison outlived Westinghouse by 17 years and grabbed that much more of posterity.

If you want to see how industrial development can be achieved without the sordidness and cynicism which usually accompany it, then see this enlightening documentary.",1350086400,4,1459,5.5225225225225225
2923585,5,B000UO9ULQ,"I was very impressed by this documentary but even more so by the man himself. This should be shown in every grade-school, high-school and college in America.

This should be the model for Capitalism done the right way where you profit by helping people rather than at the expense of people.

I had no idea that Mr. Westinghouse personified the form of Capitalism I personal believe in and thing would solve most of the problems today including the economic crisis. While most powerful companies today just like they did in his day do everything they can to keep the status quo and derail new technologies to prevent them coming to market. George Westing house embraced progress.

No doubt the bankers intentionally took him out of the business. What a world we would live in today had Westinghouse been able to back Tesla instead of J.P. Morgan. We would all be using clean free energy (of course there would be some fee).",1349654400,3,922,4.714285714285714
2923586,5,B000UO9ULQ,"I highly recommend this DVD.  Westinghouse deserves to be better known. For me, he is the best engineering manager who ever lived. He is a model for how Chief Executive Officers of modern companies should behave; a model for how they can nourish inventive genius -- Westinghouse managed the career of Tesla; a model for how they can combine profit making with improvements in their employees' standard of living, their health, and their happiness.  This DVD gives the details of the great man's inventive, productive live.",1346889600,4,522,5.058139534883721

2923588,5,B000UO9ULQ,"I am from Pittsburgh and I thought I knew something about George Westinghouse. After seeing this video I admit I knew very little about this man. If you want insight into the industrialization of this country, this video is a must see. And, if you are from Western PA or at least an American, you are missing an important history lesson in this documentary. I can't say enough about how George Westinghouse should have been the role model for all generations of businessmen, industrialists, and flat out human beings in general. Watch it and you will be inspired.

Entrepreneur...Humanitarian...It is actually incredibly difficult to pigeonhole this amazingly versatile manor to easily sum up his contributions to this country and the world....

-Most men had they invented a tool that would demonstrably save many liveswould die happy in the knowledge that they had made an important contribution to their fellow man....George Westinghouse succeeded in inventing MANY such toolsall the while, showing to the world the incredible good that a caring Capitalist can achieve, through his exemplary treatment of his employees: building them state-of-the-art homeswith gardens; refusing to lay off workerseven during bad economic times; paying his workers far more than any competitor; and, most importantly, letting them know how valued each was, by not only publicly acknowledging employees accomplishments, but allowing individual employees to patent inventions under their own names (NOT their employers name, as is still the legal norm today)....What a treat to see the gorgeous, Art Deco designs the Westinghouse company championedelevating the homely kitchen appliance to high art; and the incredibly imaginative Worlds Fair exhibits the company regularly constructed....In short, although I rarely-to-never watch any type of engineering-type documentary, I found this one fascinating.....Excellent job!",1524960000,,1466,6.116504854368932
