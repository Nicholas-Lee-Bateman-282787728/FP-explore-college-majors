8669853,5,B00M2FVQQI,I definitely got into the show - loved the Justice League series from the early 2000's. So a show based off of the similar premise and characters was great. Loving this - just heard that they are finally getting ready for season three!,1485648000,,235,4.488372093023256

8669857,3,B00M2FVQQI,"Sorry for the advance post. First, It goes without saying how much this excellent series needs to return to tv (and NOT as a horrid live action teen drama). And does WB have so much older product in their warehouse that they toss out their old covers and put them in new packaging? I'm sure this re-release has the same exact discs from the previous individual and combo set releases. The ""Robin"" artwork is kinda different, just not crazy about the ""wb family multi-feature"" banner on top (which belongs on their movie combo sets and not this). It is less yellow, and has the current ""DC"" page peel which looks more modern liker other current dc/wb releases, which is cool. Maybe this product exist to keep their YJ license current. As a fan, I'm all for anything to keep this tv series in motion in anyform (except live action teen dramas). A better (and more urgent) repackaging job needs to be done on Legion of Superheroes three pack (three volumes sold taped together in shrinkwrap as one set). That one really needs to be condensed into a single case  very badly, and maybe with nifty new artwork saying it's season one, which it actually is. Finally releasing the second season of LOSH goes without saying. Again, glad to see any JY action, including the blu-ray release of season one by Warner Archives. I just hope that this actually leads to the return of this amazing show, which I would definitely purchase  further seasons.",1407628800,4,1437,4.675889328063241
