7967210,5,B00006D28T,"I haven't watched any Popeye cartoons since I was a kid, but once we plugged it in for my grandsons to watch, I actually started remembering certain episodes from 40 and 50 years ago.  This is a great DVD to have around for young kids, because so many of the new cartoons have way too much violence.",1378252800,,299,4.245614035087719
7967211,4,B00006D28T,"A cheap DVD with 10 famous studios theatrical shorts from the last few years the original series ran. Contrary to what other fanatics tell you, the animation in the famous era is just as good as the original Fleischer studios. While the Fleischers had been fired, the rest of the crew remained active while the studio was renamed. Max and Dave oversaw the process but they had very little to do with the actual animation and as such the Famous Studios episodes are no worse than the originals. The only feature missing from the Fleischer era is the Stereoptical process they occasionally used to make 3D background, but in the last few years before the name change they no longer used the process anyways.
If you're working on your popeye collection and already have the Warner Bros release of all the black and white shorts, you'll be happy to know that this DVD has none. If you've collected other popeye DVDs you're going to get a few repeats, but that is usually the case. The condition of the shorts isn't as bad as most other releases of them and even have the original title cards and not the modified a.a.p. intros.
All in all, this DVD is an excellent purchase for the Popeye aficionado. It won't overlap with the classic warner box sets. Since they aren't continuing to release the rest of the classic popeye shorts on DVDs, this is about as good as it gets if you want Famous Studios colored shorts.",1287792000,2,1410,4.5770750988142295
7967212,4,B00006D28T,"All of the Popeye shorts on this GOOD TIMES VIDEO DVD were produced by Paramount's FAMOUS STUDIOS cartoon division. Animator and storyman Jack Mercer provided the sailor's voice. Orchestrations were by Winston Sharples (formerly of Van Beuren Studiios).

7967213,1,B00006D28T,"""Popeye:  When Popeye Ruled the World"" continues the tradition of sub-par Popeye DVD releases, and manages to find a new low.  Most of the available Popeye DVDs are a mixed bag of Fleischer classic toons and the later, cheaper produced Famous Studios toons.  ""Popeye: When Popeye Ruled the World"" includes no Fleischer animation and is purely a Famous Studios production.
Included on this DVD are ""Garden Gopher,""  ""Insect To Injury,"" ""Cookin' With Gags,"" ""Private Eye Popeye,"" ""Popeye For President,"" ""Out To Punch,"" ""Shuteye Popeye,"" ""A Haul In One,"" ""Taxi Turvy,"" and ""Bride And Gloom.""  Most of these cartoons are available on the Winstar Popeye DVD series.  All of the cartoons are color, and from the ""cheap gag"" era of Popeye animation.
Also included on this DVD are the bizarre updated sound effects that have become a hallmark of Popeye on DVD.  The sound blares in inappropriate places,  footsteps sound like mallets and the dialog is obscured.  The picture quality is the usual, and no restoration seems to have been done.
As a ""special feature,"" the documentary included on ""Popeye: When Popeye ruled the Seven Seas"" makes a re-appearance.  It is an interesting feature,  but not good enough for a rerun.
I will look much closer before I buy another DVD in this Goodtimes Popeye series.  Even in the desert that is Popeye on DVD,  ""Popeye: When Popeye Ruled the World"" is worth a miss.",1031875200,24,1397,4.918803418803419
