2896148,4,B000TAN8ZK,"But at times, this show it outright H-I-L-A-R-I-O-U-S!! Miley is so dramatic, and her friend isn't much better. Today, I saw the Jonas Brothers episode, and it was so funny, and I stayed glued to the tube. I can't help, but fall for this show's silly charm! And her Dad, is S-C-R-U-M-P-T-I-O-U-S. Let's just get THAT outta the way NOW.

Long story short, the Jonas brother, received a hit song in the making, from Miley's Dad, and Miley herself, got this super-genius idea to smash all that they (JBs) were going to achieve with that first single, and eventually the album. Her and her friend, decide to dress up as Dudes, and totally just mess everything up. They come out ready to rock, and start singing the song that was planned for the JBs. Nick and his brothers' jaws drop, and they consult Billy, to be sure this isn't some scary nightmare;

They get found out, and Miley and her friend look so stupid. Worth watching!

2896149,5,B000TAN8ZK,"I bought this DVD for my 9 year old step-daughter and she absolutely loves it.  As for my part, I would rather see my kid enjoying Hannah Montana over the likes of Britney, Christina, and the rest.

I've heard and read such good things about Billy Ray Cyrus and the way he and his wife have raised Mylie that I'll support any item that my kid wants to get from the Hannah Montana line of products.",1195689600,10,397,4.2105263157894735

2896156,1,B000TAN8ZK,"That's So Raven is way better than Hannah Montana.
I mean, Raven actually is hilarious, is a great actress, and can sing.
Miley Cyrus, on the other hand, can't act that good. She is an OK singer, she can only sing Rockish Alternative Pop music because her voice is so raspy.

Hannah Montana copies off of That's So Raven in these ways:

1. About a pop star, who keeps it a secret from everyone, but her family knows she is Hannah Montana. (Raven is psychic, only her family and friends know. It's a secret from everyone else.)

And, that's the biggest CLUE, that Hannah Montana is copying straight off of That's So Raven. Which is still Disney Channel's only show to have 100 episodes.
Plus, Hannah Montana's viewers have gone down to 2 million every new episode.
It music suck, because That's So Raven drew in over 3 million viewers every episode, and gets 1.8 million viewers on ABC Kids on Saturday Morning.

NOW THAT'S TALENT!!!",1216684800,,932,4.596385542168675
2896157,3,B000TAN8ZK,"My sister bought this for my daugter for Christmas. She was very excited when she got it! One rainy day she decided to watch it. She was a little disapointed with the episodes. They are always shown on T.V. plus it doesen't even come with many episodes. When she watched the extras she was sad to see how short they were. Well my last hope was the music vid. included, but sadly it was only Billy R. Cyrus singing. All in all it wasen't the best Hannh DVD. I hope One In A Million is better!",1198972800,3,491,4.125

2896159,5,B000TAN8ZK,"The music and the messages are all pretty good in these four episodes of the ""Hannah Montana"" television series. Believe in yourself, then rock out -- yeah, it's not that deep, but it's better than a lot of what girls hear these days. Why buy this when it's already on TV? So your kids always have a TV alternative to scanning through ""The Girls Next Door,"" ""Rock of Love"" and all that other stuff.

As for the bonus features, the Billy Ray Cyrus music video ""Ready, Set, Don't Go"" is surprisingly moving. It's filled with touching old snapshots and video clips of he and his daughter as she grows up. If you, like me, have a teenage daughter, it's hard to watch it without tearing up.",1197417600,5,685,4.436507936507937
