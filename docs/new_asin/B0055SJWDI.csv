4581038,5,B0055SJWDI,my husband is a western fan.  He likes the older western because they do not have profanity in them.  This pack has some of his favorites actors in them and he is loving each one of them.,1412208000,,187,4.027027027027027
4581039,1,B0055SJWDI,"Once again I have run into a couple of frisbees in this packet to take to the park. Once again the quality in my opinion is extremely poor from ""Echo Bridge Home Entertainment"" as printed on the back of the case in the bottom left hand corner. From this point on if I see ""Echo Bridge Home Entertainment"" on the bacxk of any DVD case, I will not be purchasing those DVDs. I have got enough frisbees to last me for awhile. Don't waste your money!",1410134400,,445,4.186046511627907

4581044,5,B0055SJWDI,We love westerns old and new.  Lee Van Cleef is the greatest in spaghetti westerns.  The DVD came in great shape.  Thank you Amazon.,1402963200,,132,4.416666666666667
4581045,3,B0055SJWDI,"Reminds me of sitting in the movie theater, all day on Saturday's when I was a kid, and just hoping there was a double feature on that day.......well it's not the same, believe me.......to see the actors and how fake it was really hit me. All one has to do, these days is buy a dvd filled with old black and white westerns, and watch them and they will make you really look at the movies today, with dolby surround sound, 55 to 60 inch H.D.  TV screens, and think ""how in the world will the people in the next generation think about us, and how we survived. I think about it whenever I watch these old westerns......and wonder what John Wayne, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry would be thinking about seeing these movies like we're doing now........ummmmmmmmmm. So if you want to be entertained for a few hours just buy these westerns.....",1402012800,,829,4.453947368421052

4581048,1,B0055SJWDI,"It is poor quality.  I am throwing it away.  It's awful.
Shame on Amazon for selling it.  So disappointed in this purchase.",1401321600,8,123,4.5
4581049,3,B0055SJWDI,"Boy do these take us back.......some are a bit amateurish but that would be because of the advances in technology, and storyline.
Have been spoiled with the modern westerns. Good bit of memorabilia.",1397865600,,198,5.03030303030303
4581050,5,B0055SJWDI,Great fun to watch and are fine for most all ages. We watch them in our travel trailer. We like to watch them at home as well.,1393977600,,126,3.7037037037037037

4581052,2,B0055SJWDI,"Hate this series.  Stupid plots, good actors acting silly.  Not entertaining.  Put it in the class of ""dumb and dumber!""",1385337600,,120,4.9

4581055,1,B0055SJWDI,These are some of the worst movies ever made.  The spaghetti westerns are pathetic.  The others are TV movies from the 70s.  The picture quality is terrible.  What a massive waste of $5.  Pathetic.,1374192000,6,197,4.676470588235294
4581056,5,B0055SJWDI,"Sure they are older movies, and the film print isn't pristine, but for the money, it's great entertainment. People try to say the film quality isn't like todays films, but in 20 to 30 years, the newer films will be the same way these are. My wife and I really enjoyed, so much we ordered a couple of more different sets. Great westerns.",1373673600,13,336,4.349206349206349
