1341994,5,B00004RE5P,Tuesday Weld rules in this teenage 50's rock n' roll classic with great musical scores. It's a must see!!!,1112486400,,106,4.631578947368421
1341995,1,B00004RE5P,"If there's a worse movie than this I haven't seen it! Looks like it was made in a day. The quality is dark and muddy with choppy edits. Sort of like it was copied from a VHS tape that was recorded in the 6 hour mode after it was played 6,000 times. The actors and actresses deliver their lines like they are playing aliens in a bad Twilight Zone episode. If you look hard enough you can see the guy holding the cue cards in the scenes. The musical performances are obscure little known Doo Wop Flops! (except for Frankie Lymon). Look.....I wasted $14.99 plus tax plus gas to ""run out"" and buy this bomb. The only possible way to save it would be to maybe dub it in Swedish, send it to a Greenwich Village ""art house"" and pass it off as a foreign film. Come to think of it....don't bother to dub it.....the sound is so off it looks dubbed already! IMPORTANT UPDATE.....PLEASE READ THIS! I later discovered after I wrote this review that there is some significant social redeeming value to this little gem of the 50's. I understand that it is used constantly at the International Institute For Sleep Disorders as the most preferred method of inducing a semi-comcious near sleep state for incurable Insomniacs. And so as I write this update I've been watching the flick again and I must admit.....I.....(yawn) oh excuse me...where was I...oh yes I must admit that I.....(bigger yawn) Oh my goodness....I'm so sorry....This is so rude of me....(yawn) but it seems like.....(snoring)....I....(snoring) I just can't seem to (intense snoring).........",1111708800,,1544,4.743494423791821
1341996,5,B00004RE5P,"Okay, I saw this on a Saturday afternoon when I was about 8 on television and later on ""Night Flight"" (of blessed memory). Anyone who has seen this knows how bad the acting and how cornball the story was. Actually, that's part of the appeal. But the MUSIC! That's where the fun begins! Chuck Berry, Frankie Lymon, LaVern Baker (of ""Jim Dandy"") fame, original doo-woppers the Moonglows (a few years before Marvin Gaye joined), etc. Alan Freed's band isn't half bad either.
Now the goofy acting and dumb story provides lots of unintended laughs. Especially when Teddy Randazzo and his buddies try to rock with outrageously bad singing and dancing that makes Al Gore look like James Brown! What a hoot! Get it, program it to the good stuff, and enjoy.",1083110400,18,748,4.717557251908397
1341997,4,B00004RE5P,"The one true Rock film that should be released on DVD is Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock. Also featuring Freddie Bell and the Bellboys AND The Platters.
It's truly the best Rock movie in the early Rock era.",1077667200,2,209,4.384615384615385
1341998,5,B00004RE5P,"Finally released on DVD this is a great opportunity to view some of the early stars of Rock'n'Roll. The plot is pure hokum and must've taken at least five minutes to write but this film is worth buying just to catch Chuck Berry, The Johnny Burnette Trio, Frankie Lymon etc. miming their hits of the day.
The transfer to DVD is good, picture quality is excellent, the sound is just OK, it was a low-budget exploitation movie so Hi-Fi quality was probably not top of the agenda. One annoying feature is a 'pop-up' logo at the bottom of the screen during one of the songs. The extras, well the one extra, in the way of an Alan Freed Bio is interesting and adds some value to this release. Well done to Passport Productions, now how about a DVD release for the other low-budget Rock'n'Roll films from the '50's?",1057017600,18,807,4.45945945945946
1341999,5,B00004RE5P,"Hi everybody,  my name is Gert 34 years old living in New Jersey. First of all I want to thank the publisher responsible for bringing this masterpiece on the market, THANKS!!  Do not expect too much about the plot in this movie or acting skills, but to see the clips in it, that is awesome.  I am a big oldies and doowop fan and started to get bored by seeing always the same names on greatest-hits-kinda-like video clips.  I know that there so many clips available from the fifties, of artists other then Fats Domino or Elvis, no offence because I like them too.  But I know that there are many people out there (all ages) that are dying to see more rock and roll movies of the fifties and early sixties come out.  I hope that it will not stop with this movie alone...  But American Anthems like ""Go Johnny GO"" or ""The big beat"" and more should be available too on the market on DVD if possible.
Now back to the movie Rock Rock Rock.  The quality is awesome and if you want to skip the storyboard of the movie and hit the music...? No problem just select the Chapters and select any song you want to hear.  And as a big bonus you will find a documentary about Alan Freed, one of the first Rock And Roll DJ's who lived and died for the Big Beat. In other words, if you are into doo wop, Rockabilly, Jive, Rock and Roll then... THIS MOVIE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!  Gkassel@comcast.net",1056672000,4,1382,4.280769230769231
1342000,1,B00004RE5P,"I agree with the other reviewers about the plot, but the music is bad too.  Aside from Chuck Berry's one tune and Franky Lyman and the Teenagers, most of the songs are the kind that you never hear on ""Oldies"" or ""Classic Rock"" radio.  Some of the tunes were so bad I doubt that records of them were ever made.  I HOPE records of them were never made.  Watching this was painful. I...found myself fast forwarding not just the stupid plot, but the out of tune and very very corny music.  This is the worst rock n roll movie I ever saw.  I was a 10 year old rocker when this was made, and believe me, there was a lot more to rock n roll than this.",1028678400,,644,4.031496062992126
1342001,3,B00004RE5P,"The movie I first saw on AMC channel last summer and thought that the music was great but then I saw the acting and said ""Oh My God""!Where did they get these people. But awesome perfomances by Frankie Lymon & Others help the movie. This is a collecters item and if your a fan of Doo Woop & Rock'N'Roll you should get it.",982368000,9,320,4.095238095238095
1342002,4,B00004RE5P,"For many years I listened to rock and roll oldies but this film features Chuck Berry, Frankie Lymon and the teenagers, music from Connie Francis.  Actually the best thing about this film is all about the music and I dodnt  care much for the storyline.  However I cant wait to see the DVD version  when it comes out this year.  Currently I do have the old beta version of  this video.",963100800,8,383,4.323943661971831

1342034,3,B00004RE5P,"This old movie has some excellent film clips of various great rock 'n roll artists lip syncing their songs, but the plot is so boring and most of the songs are slow ballads instead of ""rock 'n roll"" (apparently trying to please the elderly parents instead of the teenagers).",1449273600,,274,4.612244897959184
1342035,2,B00004RE5P,wish it were better.  still some good rock moments...,1441152000,,53,4.888888888888889
1342036,2,B00004RE5P,"I am old enough to have seen this movie when it first came out way back when but I can't remember if I saw it then.  There were a number of Alan Freed movies like this.  I wondered then, as I do now, why they sang songs I had never heard of.  If they had used popular songs, the movie would have been much better, particularly since the plots were pretty hokey.  It was interesting that Tuesday Weld lip-synced a song using Connie Francis' voice and Connie was not in the movie.  Connie was the best female vocalist of my generation, in my opinion.  I can't remember Tuesday Weld ever singing a song but I remember her well from her days on The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis TV show.  I actually purchased the 5-DVD set of that series last year and have had a ball watching it.",1430956800,,774,4.1891891891891895
1342037,5,B00004RE5P,"These groups were a little before my time, as I didn't become a teenager until 1963, but remembering Tuesday Weld on ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"" was a treat.  She was a heart-throb for this teenager...so easy on the eyes.  I was curious about her., so looked her up on Wikipedia.com and found that she is now 71, and, apparently doing well.  Nice to see you, Thalia Mennenger!",1430265600,,381,4.492753623188406

1342040,5,B00004RE5P,"Horrible movie. 5 stars but only because of 13 year old Tuesday Weld cuteness. I think this is her first credited work in her career. A must have for Tuesday Weld fans, like me. Otherwise, skip it. Although, there are some entertaining musical acts including Frankie Lyman and Chuck Berry.",1424736000,,289,4.8
1342041,4,B00004RE5P,"Rock, Rock, Rock is a strung-together bunch of mostly excellent music videos of the EARLY days of rock. It's obvious there wasn't much money invested into this, but it is certainly worth sitting through the agonizing ""plot line,"" which is more awful than I could ever describe. Here are the artists who inspired the Beatles, The Rolling Stones and so many others. If nothing else, watch it for Chuck Berry who is absolutely fabulous, as always!

If you don't know who Alan Freed is, it's time for you to do some research if you ever hope to define yourself as a devotee of rock.",1413244800,,578,4.5576923076923075
1342042,1,B00004RE5P,I did not care for it. It was dull and uninspiring. The acting was poor. The picture quality was fine though.,1402012800,,109,4.238095238095238
1342043,3,B00004RE5P,Only watched it to see the performers Like LaVerne Baker. Everything was ok until they had Tuesday Weld and some other guy sing something that had nothing to do with Rock or Roll.  Watch it just for the music. Oh and to see Alan Freed.,1396569600,,235,4.222222222222222
1342044,3,B00004RE5P,"ROCK, ROCK, ROCK (1956) has a simple plot: 13-year-old Tuesday Weld tries earning enough to buy a dress for the high school dance. Her innocent puppy love tale is punctuated with a couple of tunes. Tuesday supposedly performs ""I Never Had A Sweetheart"" and ""Little Blue Wren,"" but the singer is actually a pre-fame Connie Francis.

Weld's movie boyfriend, Paul Carr provides his own vocals on ""If Not For You,"" and Tuesday/Connie duets with him for ""Who Are We To Say.""

The terminally geeky ""Moondog"" DJ, Alan Freed was an early champion of rock and roll who worked for desegregation by presenting black artists to white audiences. A 1959 ""payola"" conviction derailed Freed's career and he died penniless in 1965 at age 42.

When watching this movie, you will find that you will have to skip through the movie just to watch the rock and roll acts.  But boy are they worth it!

7920704,1,B00004RE5P,"Cheesy, bad acting, bad direction. Interesting tidbit of rock & roll movie history. Mainly gave it 1 star for Chuck Berry's appearance in the film.",1469491200,,147,4.92
7920705,2,B00004RE5P,"Cool to see some of the musical acts, but this film is best viewed as a campy moment. The plot is insipid, and hearing Connie Francis' voice coming out of Tuesday Weld's lips is pretty surreal.",1469404800,,193,4.388888888888889
7920706,4,B00004RE5P,a feel good/nostalgic movie.  Lots of songs performed by the original artists.,1465776000,,78,5.5
