5669643,5,B00BRI96BS,"Really good story...not an epic, not a a full on cryfest drama, not a girly romance.  It seems more like a story that could happen to anyone.  The leads are a seemingly unsentimental girl w/ a hard goal and a harmless screw up boy who needs to learn responsibility.  But as the story unfolds (& it does this slowly I must warn) you come to see their annoying traits as quirky ones formed by their histories.  The ending is not perfectly realistic, but very satisfying.  If you are fan of Korean work, you will figure it all out early on, but even then, it is heartwarming.  MDH sat thru this one w/ me & enjoyed it too, though it took him a while to warm up to the male protagonist.  Will share this one w/ my friends who can make the time to watch it unfold.",1372032000,3,759,4.157534246575342

8573105,5,B00BRI96BS,Love this movie. I think Song Joong-ki is one of the top ten actors in the world today. He has given an outstanding performance in everything I have seen him in and this movie is no exception. A must see.,1409184000,2,204,4.125
8573106,5,B00BRI96BS,"I am very happy with this movie.  It's very light-hearted and funny, but also makes you think about why and how some people spend money wiuthout real thought and why others are penny pinchers.  I highly recommend this movie if you want to spend some time watching a well written and directed movie.

The actors portraying the main characters are very good in their roles.  I'll be searching out more of their work after watching this.  I also found out that I own several other movies from this production company and saw another movie in the trailers that looks interesting.

The main theme song sounds like it is sung by Jong Woo who starred in Coffee Prince and Finding Mr. Destiny. Two series on my repeat watch favorites list.  I recognize his distinctive voice.  That was a pleasant bonus to discover.",1389052800,2,807,4.673758865248227
