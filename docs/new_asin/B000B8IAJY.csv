2408764,4,B000B8IAJY,"Pride 28: High Octane showcases top caliber fighters like Heath Herring, Dan Henderson and Mirko Cro Cop. But there's one problem. The formula of the fight card pits Pride's cream of the crop veterans vs newcomers and rookies. This can be problematic for obvious reasons. The show is swamped with predictability and freak injuries.

Yet the PPV's saving grace is the highly anticipated main event Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson vs Wanderlei ""Axe Murderer"" Silva. This is the explosive rematch from their first heated encounter in the 2003 Middleweight Championship bout, where Wanderlei Silva won by TKO. This time around, Quinton Jackson is bigger and badder than ever, and he is easily the toughest opponent Silva will face yet. This is one of the very few hyped matches that actually deliver the goods. If you're a fan of either fighter, the rest of the mediocre card becomes a forgivable byproduct of the PPV. However, if you're purchasing the event with intentions of watching a star-studded show stacked with your favorite fighters waging war against equally threatening opponents, I'm guessing you probably won't think very highly of High Octane.

2408765,4,B000B8IAJY,"Most of the fights on this card are mildly interesting at best. I am a huge MMA fan, but Pride has a way of boring the hell out of me. I give this a four star rating simply for the main event... it really is one of the best fights that Pride has to offer. Buy this DVD just to have this fight... I am serious.",1139788800,3,309,3.696969696969697
2408766,5,B000B8IAJY,"I've been a fan of MMA for many years, but to make this review short,(because God knows I can go on and on about MMA, which I absolutely love) and to provide a review for many people considering if this dvd is worth it; I'll get right into it. I absolutely loved this pay-per view; it was a long time coming and worth every penny then on pay-per view, and definately worth every penny now to add to your collection. Of course, I don't have to tell the real die hard fans like myself that, but this is a review for the new fans to the sport, who are looking for a great fight dvd and are skeptical like I used to be years ago, because like I said, I have been, still am, and always will be a die-hard fan of MMA. This is one of thE best fighting dvds ever. I plan to rate more dvds, but do not want to spoil any of the outcomes, so won't be revealing much details, but I will say ""this is an awesome one."" Take a view at my other reviews if you don't belive me. Wanderlei Silva vs. Quinton Jacskon 2, need I say more. Just trust me, you won't be disapointed, no matter who you are rooting for. You've just got to respect them both for the tremendous heart and courage both champions have. It is longer and better than their first fight at Final Conflict 2003. It is so good, that just that fight is worth the price of the dvd alone.",1138320000,,1331,4.045454545454546
2408767,4,B000B8IAJY,"This event was dissapointing because of some freak injuries, but Wanderlei vs Rampage alone is worth the price this event.

Wanderlei Silva v Quinton Jackson- Probably the best fihgt of 2004 both guys were floored during the fight and came back to put on a great show.

Cro-Cop v Josh Barnett- Very dissapointing the way it ended.

James Thompson v Aleksander Emilianenko- This was a decent fight and you see Aleksander is for real.

Allistair Overeem v Hiromitsu Kanehara- All I have to say is mismatch, you get a chance to see what a thai boxer can do with their knees.

Dan Henderson v Kazuhiro Nakamura- I was really looking forward to this fight but it was very dissapointing",1133136000,2,680,4.680672268907563

8083522,4,B000B8IAJY,"PRIDE 28: HIGH OCTANE is one of the most brutal Pride cards I've ever seen. It contains at least five fights that deserve this adjective, with some great come-from-behind wins, too. Unfortunately, there are also two potentially classic matchups that get short-circuited by freak injuries, which is why I had to penalize HIGH OCTANE one star.

The spoiler-free lineup is:

Herring vs. Yakoi - What this fight lacks in length it makes up for in brutality.

Arona vs. Ignatov - A solid matchup between a Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert versus Russian wrestler.

A. Emilianenko vs. Thompson - Don't blink or you'll miss this Clash of Really Big Dudes.

A. Overeem vs. Kanehara - A brutal, one-sided fight between a striker and a... strikeee.

Hunt vs.  Bobish - Ouch. They fought like two drunk fat guys over the last slice of pizza.

Henderson vs. Nakamura - What could have been an epic is stopped early by a freak injury.

Cro Cop vs. Barnett  - The first installment of their weird three-fight trilogy, is, like the last fight, stopped fast by another freak injury.

W. Silva vs. Jackson  - The rematch between these two blood rivals is as wickedly violent as the first.

Bonus Match: Be vs. Palalei - Slow starter turns into ""Rocky II.""

Special Features: The usual, plus a ""Jackson vs. Silva: The Rematch"" promotional short.

Pride FC was the best MMA organization on the planet at one time.  This DVD is during their reign.  Not many American names that bandwaggon fans will know.  If you like UFC pass, if you watch Dream and Strickforce you will enjoy.  Also recommended for Wanderlei Silva marks, he destroys Rampage...again.",1266451200,,426,4.626666666666667

8083527,3,B000B8IAJY,"ok, i love my pride. but this one is kinda weak. if you are looking for an action packed dvd, look for another. this has 2 - 3 decent fights. half of them , the fighters fall down or quit because they hurt themselves.

no really , half of them just give up. if you are a silva fan (like me) this dvd is cool.

seriously, i have never seen so many strange things happen on a fight program. guys just falling over. people blowing out their knees or shoulders. giants getting cut down by blows that wouldnt knock out a middleweight.

it seemed i was saying ""WTF WAS THAT??!!"" after every 2 fights.",1176249600,,594,4.192982456140351
8083528,4,B000B8IAJY,"This should be a great night of fights. On the card, we have the rematch between Pride Middleweight champ, Wanderlei Silva and Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson. We also get to see Cro Cop take on Josh Barnett, which is also a highly anticipated fight. The rest of the fights could go either way, having little effect on the Pride divisions. Let's get to the action.

Hirotaka Yokoi v. Heath Herring:

They call Heath the ""Texas Crazy Horse"" over in Japan. He is a madman in there most of the time, which makes him an exciting fan favorite. He comes out blazing in this fight and the ref calls a timeout as Yokoi is taking knees to the head on the ground after being dropped. This is very strange. It all ends not too long after this point. This is a very good fight to kick off the event.

Ricardo Arona v. Sergey Ignatev:

Arona is coming back from being KO-slammed by Quinton Jackson, his only Pride loss. Arona looks great this time out and gets himself back on track with an excellent display of ground fighting technique. Arona lost his shot at fighting Wanderlei Silva for the title to Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson, but he is determined to get back to top contender status.

Alexandre Emelianenko v. James Thompson:

This immediately turns into a wild slugfest. Thompson is making his Pride fighting debut. Do you think he makes a good showing or goes quickly down in flames in a matter of seconds?

Alistair Overeem v. Hiromitsu Kanehara:

Overeem had lost his last fight to the UFC's Chuck ""The Iceman"" Liddell by knockout. He is back in Pride and looking to re-establish himself. He dictates the pace of this lopsided fight. Kanehara doesn't give in, but he takes quite a beating to prove his heart.

Dan Bobish v. Mark Hunt:

Bobish is cut very early on by a knee. The fight is allowed to go on... This is a pretty decent fight, but you don't really see the best of Mark Hunt. We do get to see a very awkward knockout, though, which is always good.

Dan Henderson v. Kazuhiro Nakamura:

Dan Henderson is something of a wildman - inside the ring. Outside, he seems to be very stoic. We see the wildman again tonight and someone gets hurt...

Mirko ""Cro Cop"" Filipovic v. Josh Barnett:

This is Barnett's Pride debut...against Cro Cop... Should be awesome. Barnett talks trash before the fight. Cro Cop laughs it off, as usual. The fight BLOWS. You'll see what I mean. This was a huge letdown, given the buildup and gravity of this fight. Too bad it couldn't have gone differently. A rematch is offered after the fight and hopefully we will see it in time.

Wanderlei ""The Axe Murderer"" Silva v. Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson:

This fight is ultra-hyped by Pride. The first time these two warriors met, Silva won in the first round. Jackson claims that Silva doesn't even hit hard and gives Chuck Liddell (who Rampage knocked out) more credit as a fighter. Jackson is on his cell phone during the playing of the Brazilian national anthem, showing no respect for Silva. I was dying to see this fight and it starts getting exciting around 2 minutes in. There is a lull in the action and then they are stood up, where they exchange and we see Silva fall to the mat. Silva turns the tide in the 2nd round and we see an amazing finish to this back and forth battle of the top middleweights in Pride Fighting. This is one of the better fights in Pride history! The DVD is a must-own.",1158192000,3,3371,4.510673234811166
8083529,5,B000B8IAJY,"PRIDE or PRIDE Fighting Championships is the largest mixed martial arts organization in the world. It is based in Japan and currently promoted by Dream Stage Entertainment (DSE). Its inaugural event was held at the Tokyo Dome on October 11, 1997, promoted by Kakutougi Revolution Spirits (KRS).  It is the most popular MMA organization in the world based on the number of event attendees: the PRIDE Final Conflict 2003 event had over 67,000 people in the audience. The audience record is 91,107 people on the PRIDE and K-1 co-production Shockwave/Dynamite, held in August 2002.  It is considered to be the premiere MMA organization on the planet.

PRIDE 28 was the highly anticipated event in which the #1 ranked 205lbs fighter in the world, Wanderlei Silva defended his World Middleweight Championship against the #1 contender in Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson.  The main event itself is one of the greatest fights in the history of Mixed Martial Arts.  A tremendous war that contains all elements of the fight game, whether it be stand up, wrestling, clinch-fighting or ground fighting.  The main event itself gives this PPV 5/5.

With that said, the undercard is somewhat lackluster.  Depite a very good card on paper, many of the fights on the card ended up resulting in disappointing, inconclusive results.  A great significant positive for the DVD is that it includes the Choi Mu Bae/Soa Palalei fight which was originally unaired on PPV.  This is a great fight, stocked to the brim with heart and humor.

Overall, this is a must have for any MMA fan because of the incredible main event.",1152403200,,1589,4.958490566037736
