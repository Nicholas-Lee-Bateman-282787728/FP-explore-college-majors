7481047,5,B016X9KMRM,It's an artsy movie.  The acting is wonderful.  The movie tackles a human truth that hasn't been addressed before.  It should be judged for what it is.,1450310400,2,151,4.518518518518518

7481058,3,B016X9KMRM,"A delusional young man dreams of being a mobster. He meets a semi-connected woman and they begin a spree of misguided choices in the era of the John Gotti trial.
It isn't spectacular, deserving of five stars, but I didn't turn it off and it kept my attention slightly more than most movies.
I would recommend it to Drama fans who have seen a ton of movies and have a hard time finding one to watch at the moment.
It reminds me of Summer of Sam in the way it represents a view of a small group of people admist a big cultural current event (Gotti trial).
Micheal Imperioli and Eric Roberts play bit parts.",1477440000,2,604,4.260869565217392

7481127,4,B016X9KMRM,"""Don't write the history books yet."" Thomas (Piazza) has become obsessed with the trial of John Gotti and thinks it is his mission to find a way to get him off. When his plan falls through He tries to find another way to become a wise-guy. The only way he can think to do this is to begin robbing mafia hangouts. Together him and his wife Rose (Arquette) complete a string of hold-ups that finally gets him noticed. I am a huge fan of any type of mafia movie. There was a fantastic movie called Rob The Mob that came out a few years ago that dealt with this same story. Like that one this one is also very good and I really liked it. There were some differences between the two but the biggest one was that Thomas was played as someone who talks a big game, but is different when he is in action in this movie. To me that little change really added to the realism of this and added to the overall feel of the movie. The acting is really good in this, but Piazza's portrayal is really what makes the movie and I highly recommend this. Overall, a very good movie that really makes you relate to Thomas, something that is usually hard to do in a mafia movie. I give this a high B+.",1450828800,3,1178,4.126086956521739
8737492,3,B016X9KMRM,"This is a split decision movie in our house.  I liked it, a lot.  My wife, on the other hand, didn't much care for it until the ""Rob the Mob"" aspect began.

Thomas is a serious wannabe made man.  He eventually befriends Rose during the John Gotti trial.  Believing he has a ringer on the jury Thomas goes to 'real' made guys for money.

Patricia Arquette does as fantastic job playing Rose, the wife of dilusional Thomas.",1502928000,,421,4.402597402597403
8737493,3,B016X9KMRM,"Thomas idolizes the Mob and especially the Teflon Don  John Gotti, seeing him as a modern day Robin Hood and the incidental crimes as sort of a necessary evil  sort of thing. Anyway we join them in 1992 when Gotti is on trial and the Teflon becomes Velcro as all the charges start to stick.

Now Thomas is going out with a girl of questionable intellect and indeed taste who is brilliantly played by Patricia Arquette. Desperate to become part of the Gangsta scene Thomas hatches a plan to free his idol but in so doing he sets off a chain of events that he will become useless to control.

So is it any good? Well it is very watchable but sometimes feels very small in that it is a very personal tale about  essentially- two people and how they believe their own bull. Whilst this does not detract from the entertainment it also leave unmolested the underlying issues of worshipping the worst in society. That said it is still a well made and acted film that will appeal to any who like mob lore but it is not in the same league as the Goodfelllas of this world.",1500681600,,1063,4.321608040201005
8737494,5,B016X9KMRM,"I really liked this movie.  I am a big fan of Patricia Arquette and I always like movies that are based on some truth. Reality is that  life isn't always fun or happy and there is always a dark side and I thought it was portrayed very well.  Vincent Piazza and Patricia Arquette were perfect for these roles and there was definitely chemistry here.  You fell for both of them. They both won your heart as addicts often do and you jumped on the merry go round with them; but you always had hope they would stop spinning. It holds your interest all the way thru. I thought it was well done even tho I don't really like sad stories I do give this movie 5 stars because it not only was well written and well acted and directed, but it was quite real.",1493596800,,746,4.159722222222222

The accents were close enough for government work and I thought the acting was superb. I used to listen to Sliwa on WABC years ago and talked to a guard who had Gotti in his bloc. He said that Gotti was a/model prisoner and a gentleman and did everything the guards asked him to do. Cleaning details and the like. So it was a fun ride back in time for me.
