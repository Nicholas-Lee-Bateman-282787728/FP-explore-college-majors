8701798,5,B00THX0SHQ,My husband enjoyed the movies. Think you,1485734400,,40,4.857142857142857
8701799,1,B00THX0SHQ,"I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted to see ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"" and my search led to this collection. Since several of the other films noirs looked interesting to me, I decided that, for the price, I should give this set a try. I trusted the 5-star review over the 1-star review because it was more literate, but I should have read the comments appended to that review in which the reviewer acknowledges that these are not remastered or DVD quality. As commenter John Doe says, ""most of the time the films look like VCR versions... or worse... like someone ripped a bad youtube video, stuck it on a VCR tape, then upscaled it to DVD. "" All  of these films are in the public domain and thus available on youtube for free. I recommend youtube for free over this collection for $8 plus shipping.",1473292800,5,813,4.3841059602649

8701801,5,B00THX0SHQ,"The quality well exceeded my expectations, and is a good selection of engaging film noir movies. Pop it in a darkened room and enjoy!",1433721600,5,133,4.583333333333333
