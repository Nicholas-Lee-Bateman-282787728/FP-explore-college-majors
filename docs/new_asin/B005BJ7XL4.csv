8464022,4,B005BJ7XL4,"Absolutely hilarious! Oh, sure, the subtitles take a little processing and take some getting used to; but the storyline is a blast! It's your typical guy-bashing movie, with a deserving object of scorn. You'll love it.",1405900800,,218,5.083333333333333
8464023,4,B005BJ7XL4,This movie was much better than the American version. It's good clean fun and humor. Andy Lau and Gong Li had great chemistry as compared to Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt.,1371340800,,167,4.419354838709677
8464024,4,B005BJ7XL4,"This re-do of the Mel Gibson film is charming but thin(as was the original), and only adds a new setting; its chief asset is Gong Li, who adds emotional weight to Helen Hunt's role.",1358294400,,181,4.352941176470588
8464025,5,B005BJ7XL4,"I thought this movie wouldn't be as good as the original American movie that was made about 10 years ago. But, you know what, it surprised me because it was just as good. You really have to understand the Chinese Culture before looking at the differences between the 2 movies. If you don't get the chinese culture, than you won't get this movie and say it's average or below average to the original. It be just two good looking, big name stars and that's it. But, it's so much more if you understand culture and understand the underlining message.

Yes, the main plot is exactly the same as the American movie, which is the way it should be. Why would or should they change it up so much that it wouldn't make sense? You might think to yourself that it's not even close to the original and so why did they have the same name? Then, you have people be blew away with all the changes and come on here saying it's way different and it's bad. Well, good thing they didn't change the movie up than and kept the original plot.

The main stars are probably the two biggest stars in China right now. And, those 2 getting casted for this movie was perfect. This movie had it all. A good mix of comedy, romance, and drama. Now throw in the plot with chinese culture mix it up and what you get? A 5 star movie that's what! I definitely recommend this movie.",1335744000,2,1346,4.2952755905511815
8464026,4,B005BJ7XL4,"I really enjoyed this movie and that's saying alot since I usually don't like romantic comedies. The one with Mel Gibson was just average but this one was better. I thought it was funnier than the American version and Andy Lau was charming and Gong Li is beautiful. I think they were a good match for this movie. If your a fan of Andy Lau or romantic comedies,then I think you will like this. If you didn't like the American version,please don't let that deter you from seeing this one. It's a much better film.",1327190400,,511,4.389473684210526
8464027,4,B005BJ7XL4,"I was surprised to find out that Andy Lau and Gong Li were remaking the Mel Gibson/Helen Hunt movie from over a decade ago, but quite intrigued. I've always thought the original was amusing and sweet, par for the course for Nancy Meyers if not necessarily for Mel Gibson.  Still, I wondered how close this remake would come and how these two stars would fair in a light-hearted romantic comedy. I'm surprised once again.
Sticking very close to the original down to verbatim lines and all, Lau and Li seem comfortable with each other and this version seems to play heavier towards the romance and not so much the silliness of the original. It was nice to see these two actors, known for their art-house movies and action epics, have some fun, even down to the closing credit bloopers.
My only issue is that there is a fairly heavy-handed appeal to western audiences with a soundtrack heavy on English language songs (Lau even sings a ballad to Li in English) which I thought smacked a little too much of pandering. I know movies are made to make money but this seemed a bit much. That said, the movie is cute and a nice Friday night movie with your lover over a bowl of popcorn.
For subtitle-challenged viewers, the words tend to move very quickly at times, so have the remote handy and enjoy a lighthearted rom-com with two thoroughly enjoyable actors.",1323907200,3,1352,4.609958506224066
8464028,4,B005BJ7XL4,"This movie is almost a direct copy of the Mel Gibson film What Women Want. Not just the title, but also the plot and even key events. The Chinese setting and ambience are different enough so that this isn't necessarily violating copyright laws, but it's nonetheless pretty blatant copying. The characters do have different quirks and have their enjoyable moments. Basically, if you want a romantic comedy like the original What Women Want with a Chinese flavor, this movie will do the trick.",1322092800,,491,4.927710843373494
