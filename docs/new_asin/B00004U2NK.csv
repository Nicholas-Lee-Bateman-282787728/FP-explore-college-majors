8252478,4,B00004U2NK,"This is not one of my favorite volumes, although I do like the episode about the faith healer, which has multiple layers to the story.  I didn't care much for the story about the two manslayers, but the best episode on this tape in my opinion is the last one, where Kenshin and his friends go to the circus.  Not only is if funny to see Kouru freaked about by the haunted houses, but we get to see (or more like hear) Kenshin do somthing that I don't think you'll hear him do anytime soon in the series;  Sing ^_^",1001635200,,513,4.11
8252479,5,B00004U2NK,"This volume 4 of rurouni kenshin it's really cool, trust me if you haven't seen rurouni kenshin yet get it it's so cool and those for you collecting GET IT this tapes great mainly the first episode focuses on megumi and the tohers are really action packed, and also at times it has some really hillarious parts. GET THIS it's great! I can't reccomend it more than to give it 100 out of 10 everything about it is cool, even the dubbed voices are great in my opinion.",992563200,4,465,4.295454545454546
8252480,5,B00004U2NK,"Kenshin is one best animes I've seen, if you've seen Kenshin-The Legendary Swordsman this is a must.  The story is before the Legendary Swordsman episodes and tell the story of Kenshin growing up from a slave(5 yrs) to swordsman(15 yrs).  Very good fighting scenes and a lot of blood.  The second episode is when Kenshin meets a woman that earlier in episode 1 Kenshin killed her fiance, and the fall of Kenshins clan. A must see!",973209600,,430,4.631578947368421
8252481,5,B00004U2NK,"Kenshin is just about the best Anime I've ever seen.  The Main Chartacter is a wondering Samauri who has sworn never to kill again.  In the first few episodes he meets new friends.  If this is the video that contains his  fight with Sano, opne of the most intricate Characters of the series  appears, carrying an ancient Chinese Weapon used to chop horses in half.  Kenshin, carrying a reversed Katana, has to fight him to save his freinds.  The Fighting, character development, and animation are spectacular.  An  enjoyment for any avid Anime fan",960854400,2,547,4.795698924731183
