I found it very informative and really changed many of my misconceptions of what the holy land really looks like. Now, as I read the bible, I feel like I have a much better foundation for my mind's eye understanding what the imagery would have been like.

If I had to give it one knock, I would say that the ""tour"" as I call it, being geographically oriented, doesn't flow with the timeline of the Bible per se, so sometimes you feel like you are jumping around between books of the Bible. It makes sense though, when you think about it.

We liked it enough, I just ordered ""Land of the Bible Jordan and Judea"", from the same people.",1395532800,,762,4.397163120567376
