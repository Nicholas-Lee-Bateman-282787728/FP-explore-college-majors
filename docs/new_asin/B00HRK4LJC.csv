8634878,5,B00HRK4LJC,"Here is an Australian crime mystery thriller series to stand alongside Morse (and Endeavour and Lewis, also), Inspector Frost, Vera, Inspector Lynley Mysteries, D.C.I Banks, Shetland, Foyles War, Midsomer Murders, Colombo, Jesse Stone, Wallender, Poirot, Miss Marple, Silent Witness, Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries,  you get the picture.
Jane Halifax is a Forensic Psychiatrist, often working for lawyers (attorneys) or their client, or as a psychological profiler or police.
She is an expert, highly professional, beautiful, single, and complicated. (Brilliantly acted by Rebecca Gibney).
The series is created by one of Australias great television series  and mini-series production team, Simpson, LeMesurier, and others.
The script writers and directors are some of Australias best.
The cast, varying across successive episodes, but with plausible sequential life-story development centred (naturally) around Jane Halifax (Rebecca Gibney), includes a pantheon of the best Australian film and television actors, such as Hugh Jackman, Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce, Robyn Nevin, Steve Bisley, Colin Friels, Ben Mendelson, Gary McDonald, Essie Davis, William McInnes, Sophie Lee, Deborah Lee-Furness, Bruce Spence, Richard Roxburgh, Frankie J. Holden, Kerry Armstrong, Brett Climo, Damian Walshe-Howling, Lewis Fiander, Vince Colosimo, Angela Punch McGregor, Asher Keddie, Marta Dusseldorp, Michael Veitch, Rhada Mitchell, Alan Hopgood, 
The stories are strong, and well-written. Through each episode we meet the new team Jane Halifax is working with, and the investigation, and possible suspects. The mystery, and drama develops slowly, but with increasing tension as red herrings are progressively dismissed, and the target criminal eventually comes into view,  leading to a rapid, dramatically striking climax, and the a finale, sometimes ambiguous, sometimes consolatory.
Each episode was given a substantial budget, and the stories are colourfully set in and around Melbourne, the state-capital of Victoria, in the south of Australia.
The cinematography is flawless. The sets and landscapes are vividly convincing.
Mood music sets off characters and developing events and tension.
Narrative themes include undiscovered twin brother, serial rapist, psychologically damaged serial sex-murderer, psychopathic mass murderer, suicide of a parent, 
From 1994 to 2002, twenty-one episodes of 90 or 102 minutes were produced  clearly a substantial body of work!
Halifax F.P. is a classic series that deserves to be much better known. (Look for the complete set!!)

8634879,5,B00HRK4LJC,"Wife and I love this very well-done, but aging series; bought even more to watch after this set. But these DVDs require a suitable region-free DVD player, which Amazon also has, ""Sony DVP-SR320 All Multi Region Zone Code Free DVD Player Plays DVD's with USB Input 110/240 Volt (Black)"". Rebecca Gibney (more recently in the Packed to the Rafters series) is a top-rated Australian (New Zealander really) actress!",1393804800,,411,5.0588235294117645
