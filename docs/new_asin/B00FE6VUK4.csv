8614731,5,B00FE6VUK4,"My 14 month old grandson watches this every night wish there were more movies-he loves Heros of the City, Thomas the Train does not do it for him.",1457395200,,146,4.25
8614732,5,B00FE6VUK4,"I just had the chance to watch the Heroes of the City DVD with my son and we love it! If you haven't seen it, it is a television cartoon about rescue vehicles. There are several cute characters, including Paulie the Police Car (my sons favorite) and Fiona the Fire Engine.  As a parent, I really liked the themes of serving others and I think the problem solving skills that they address are so important for young children to learn early in their lives.  Loved the animation, too, very fun!",1395273600,2,491,4.444444444444445
8614733,4,B00FE6VUK4,"I received it quickly.  The box was not damaged.  However, the DVD was not secure in its case.  I realize that this could happen with anything.  Otherwise, extremely satisfied.",1388102400,,176,4.9655172413793105
