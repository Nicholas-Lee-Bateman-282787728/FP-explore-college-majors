8108360,3,B000ECNP9M,"When I was a kid, I was a Jimmy Wang Yu fan. But some of his own movies he directed were to outlandish. this one isn't like that. There are some very good scenes in this movie. One in a restaurant they really worked on this. And he looks like he really hit some of those boys! Lao Leih is in this one as well. While he doesn't make you believe he is a Karate man, he is always a good villain.

A few really good parts is when Jimmy sticks Low in the stomach with his fingers then pulls them out, looks realistic. I have to say I'm glad I own this one. Its a classic and one of Jimmy's better films. Get this one for sure.",1178236800,3,621,3.8515625
