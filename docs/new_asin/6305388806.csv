7889460,3,6305388806,"The story on this movie is a little out there, but you can overlook it because of the cast, which is good. Enjoyed it.",1469923200,,118,3.9583333333333335
7889461,5,6305388806,A must see especially for Sr. citizen's! Absolutely wonderful!!!!,1465689600,,65,6.333333333333333
7889462,1,6305388806,Poor quality and sound was off. Was not able to view movie.,1419897600,,59,4.0
7889463,5,6305388806,The message is very important and well illustrated.  It should be must viewing for anyone contemplating a move to a senior citizen or assisted living or nursing home facility.  Do the homework and read the fine print fro yourself or a loved one!,1374451200,,245,4.674418604651163
7889464,5,6305388806,I liked all the movie.  Lets me know senior citizens have still got it.  It is a good movie.  I actually could not compare it to another movie,1370476800,,142,4.0
7889465,4,6305388806,Ok like the other review said if your getting this because Corey Haim is in it-dont- he is only in this film altogether about 15mins.. But this movie is very good- and worth watching ..,1270684800,2,185,4.314285714285714
7889466,5,6305388806,"and are an Olympia Dukakis fan and can take the fact that Haim is in the video, then go and buy this movie!",1108598400,5,107,3.6956521739130435
7889467,1,6305388806,"This is a warning to whoever wants to buy this movie. DON'T!  You are probably making the same mistake I did when I rented this. You probably are a Corey Haim fan and think that he's the star. Well, he isn't. This movie  is just about a couple of geezers that are trying to solve a nursing home  scam. Corey Haim just has a little part, I think he's like old man's  grandson. Even if you don't like Corey Haim, do yourself a favour and don't  buy this. It's boring, long, the storyline is stupid and it was made in  Canada(that about says it all). I mean I'm Canadian but lets face it,  Canadian-made things suck!  Well that's about all I can say so, once  again, DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!",947116800,25,685,4.207692307692308
