5028600,5,B006X0ZN3K,"I remember first seeing this film as a young teenager on the late show.  I'm so glad it has been released on DVD.  I won't go into specifics on the story because that has been done by previous reviewers.  What I will say is that the DVD transfer is excellent....both sight and sound.  Stanwyck was positively the greatest actress of her generation and possibly the greatest actress of all time.  So honest, sincere and talented.  This film shows her at the peak of her craft....a true artist.  The story is engaging and keeps you in suspense from the first moment to the last.  Not one wasted reel.  Directed by Mitchell Leisen, it is film noir at its best.  The interesting thing about this film is that Stanwyck did all her stunts in the train wreck scene, along with Phyllis Thaxter.  Jane Cowl is deliciously sympathetic as the grandmother.  Lyle Bettger is a true menace and John Lund, though bland, is made to look good by Stanwyck.  This is one of her best!!",1333584000,39,965,4.540697674418604
5028601,5,B006X0ZN3K,"Barbara Stanwyck had one of her best roles in this solid suspense film. She plays Helen, a pregnant young woman fleeing her worthless lover (Lyle Bettger). On the train out of town, she meets Patrice Harkness (Phyllis Thaxter), a bride of her age and general description, who's on her way with her groom to meet her rich in-laws for the first time. When the train crashes and the newlyweds are both killed, the desperate Helen sees a chance at a new life for herself and her unborn child. So Helen becomes Patrice, and she's accepted by the dead woman's in-laws and taken into their home. Her new ""family"" is kind to her, and the dead groom's brother (John Lund) even falls for her. Everything's like a dream come true--until the creepy ex-boyfriend shows up with blackmail on his mind...

This film is one of my favorites, and it's much better than the 1996 remake, MRS. WINTERBOURNE, which tried to turn this dark thriller into a comedy. Take my advice and stick with the original.

5028602,5,B006X0ZN3K,"I remember this as a pretty good melodrama. I believe this is the first time it's has ever been available on home video and I, for one intend to purchase it.

SPOILER ALERT!

As the film opens, Stanwyck is pregnant. ""Baby Daddy"" Lyle Bettger throws her out into the street with a one-way ticket out of town. On the train, Barbara meets newlywed Phyllis Thaxter who is is also pregnant and going to see her wealthy in-laws for the first time. At Thaxter's encouragement, Stanwyck tries on Thaxter's wedding ring saying ""I think this is supposed to be bad luck"" and, lo and behold, the train derails in a spectacular crash. Thaxter and her husband are killed in the crash. Stanwyck is knocked unconscious and the rescuer party assumes that Stanwyck is Thaxter because of Thaxter's ring that Stanwyck is still wearing. Times being what they are, Stanwyck decides to leave well enough alone. Then, Bettger shows up again with extortion on his mind. It's a good melodrama and I can't wait to see it again.",1328140800,34,1000,4.676136363636363
5028613,3,B006X0ZN3K,"A good film noir. As usual, Babs is very good, makes it work.. Pulls it all together. Not her best film but pretty good. I did have to laugh at the beginning of the film (not that it was meant to be funny) .. when she was in the washroom with the married lady, Mrs. Harkness. who says to her.. ""Oh i never have bad luck, couldn't if I tried.."" or something like.. famous last words..
The story pulled me in and kept my interest throughout..glad I saw it.. it's certainly not the same caliber as Double Indemnity or Sorry, wrong number (my favorite) but a good movie.",1484956800,,566,4.25

5028632,4,B006X0ZN3K,"I remember watching this as a child and the memory stuck with me for 40+ years. Finally watched it again and I was not disappointed. It deals with a subject that was strictly tabu at the time, that of unwed sex and unwed pregnancy. The scene where Barbara stanwyck beats on the door of the baby's father is striking. That sort of realism is not common in films of that age. Well worth the time it takes to watch. The ending surprised me also but don't want to reveal why.",1468800000,5,471,4.2444444444444445

It has a great little twist at the end. The only flaw I wondered about was how Helen could be such a good upstanding character after she became Patrice, yet her past indicated that she was far from moral and principled (i.e. pregnant by Steve who was such a low life).

5028676,5,B006X0ZN3K,"I love this movie! And I love Barbara Stanwyck! In fact, the entire cast is wonderful! John Lund - always watchable; Phyllis Thaxter, cute and believable; personable Richard Denning, is adorable, as usual. And the rest of the cast are good too; Jane Cowl and Henry O'Neill as the sweet, devoted older generation, Esther Dale - Hollywood's perennial crusty, housekeeper and Lyle Bettger,as the evil, menacing,and thoroughly bad, guy! It has a well-written and entertaining script - what I like to think as a ""cozy, film noir."" And to top it off, one of my favorite directors, Mitchell Leisen (who might also have had a hand in developing the script.from a William Irish novel). How can you miss with talent like that? This movie does not disappoint. It may not be heralded as one of Stanwyck's best, but I think it's been very much overlooked. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story, well-told.",1464825600,9,903,4.794871794871795
5028677,5,B006X0ZN3K,"If you watch Barbara Stanwyck movies in somewhat of a chronological order, she had it all from the git go and just improved upon herself as she matured.  This is one terrific movie that leaves you in suspense right up to the end and a great role for her to play.  If you want an amazing experience, I suggest listening to Karina Longworth tell Barbara Stanwyck's story on her You Must Remember podcast.  It made me appreciate the actress all the more!

Many reviewers have already covered the plot of this flick so I just wanted to share picture quality.  My experience with Olive Films has been that they  restore older films & do a decent job of it.  Not to Criterion standards but at least a decent improvement.  Additionally they pick up flicks that Criterion would not. I own a good many Olive offerings & have satisfied in the past. ---- However the copy I received of ""No Man"" has many, many scenes where there is a huge amount of artifacting ( white sparkly flickering throughout the whole screen.  I kid you not I felt like I received a pre restoration copy of the film and was very unpleasantly surprised.

Over time she took on different look about her, whether it was  her hair style and/ or change in makeup and carried her age very well (perhaps better than any other actress from her generation). I believe this to be the case in this movie.

Miss Stanwyck has the gift of expressing feelings that are so real and natural it draws the viewer into her role and one finds themselves totally raped up in her character. The role she plays in this movie she doesn't disappoint.  One of her lessor known movies, well worth viewing.

5028735,4,B006X0ZN3K,"The American author Cornell Woolrich (1903 -- 1968) had more of his writings adopted into film than any other noir writer. Woolrich's 1948 novel, ""I Married a Dead Man"" has been filmed several times, including this first 1950 version starring the renowned Barbara Stanwyck.  Stanwyck plays a young, poor, drifting pregnant woman, Helen, who survives a train wreck.  A wealthy elderly couple, the Harknesses, mistake Helen for Patrice, the wife of their son. Patrice and her husband had befriended Helen on the train and both died in the wreck. Helen feels guilty about living a lie as Woolrich's story explores themes of identity, loneliness, and murder. When Helen achieves some stability in her adopted home, her former caddish boyfriend attempts to blackmail her and to expose her identity.

The film adaptation follows the novel fairly closely but lacks its intensity and its exploration of character. It is more a melodrama than a dark look at guilt and moves slowly.  The first part of the movie lacks tension as it softens the character of Helen.  The film still is valuable for its interpretation of the book, for Stanwyck's acting, and for the cinematography.

Michael Leisen directed the film which also stars John Lund as Bill Harkness, the brother of Patrice's dead husband.  Bill realizes Helen is not the woman she is taken to be, but he falls in love with her anyway. Lund's acting is wooden.  Lyle Bettger offers a chilling portrait of Steve Morley, Helen's gambling, conniving former boyfriend and the father of her child. Jane Cowl and Henry O'Neill offer effective portrayals of the elderly Harkness couple. The black and white film includes some excellent scenes of the speeding, doomed train, cold snowy nights, and deserted buildings.

This might not be the best film to watch for those about to take a long train trip. I enjoyed the film and I enjoyed thinking again about Woolrich's novel.

5028754,4,B006X0ZN3K,"""No Man of Her Own"" (1950) is a dark melodrama adapted by Sally Benson and Catherine Tunney from Cornell Woolrich's novel ""I Married a Dead Man"". Helen Ferguson (Barbara Stanwyck) has traveled to New York in desperation, hoping to get some assistance from her former lover  Steve Morley (Lyle Bettger), who left her pregnant and broke. Steve's response is to slip her a train ticket for San Francisco. Eight months pregnant and lugging a suitcase, Helen sits down exhausted on her luggage after failing to find a seat on the train. A kind passenger, Hugh Harkness (Richard Denning) insists she take his seat, next to his pregnant wife Patrice (Phyllis Thaxter). The newlyweds are on their way to see Hugh's parents in Illinois, who have not yet met their daughter-in-law. The women chat and retire to the ladies' room after dinner to wash up. But the train derails. Helen awakes in a hospital with her new baby, the staff having mistaken her for the deceased Mrs. Harkness.

Sometimes categorized as ""film noir"", I would call ""No Man of Her Own"" some kind of melodrama but not necessarily the ""noir"" kind. There is a ""noir predicament"", when Helen must decide if she should pass herself off as Patrice Harkness. There is identity confusion, though it is something over which Helen has control. There is some suspense as the past threatens to catch up with Helen. There are visually interesting night scenes that take place in the snow. But the film's attitude toward these things is conventional and actually sappy at times. Barbara Stanwyck has tremendous star power but is conspicuously too old for this role. My impression of Patrice is that she couldn't be more than 25 years old, while Stanwyck was in her forties when she made this film. ""No Man of Her Own"" is more thematically constrained than ""film noir"", with few implications beyond what we see on screen. But it is entertaining enough as an odd little melodrama, due mostly to Stanwyck's talent.",1429833600,,1957,4.838805970149254

5028788,5,B006X0ZN3K,"Other reviewers have pointed out what a terrific movie this is, great cast working well together.  I wanted to add program notes:  a hallmark of Miss Stanwyck's work was a gracious ability to work with others and allow their roles to shine...in this film, there is a special bond worked out between Miss Stanwyck's character and the family that welcomes her.

 Speaking especially  of Miss Jane Cowl the theatrical legend, who plays the grandmother in this film, if you want to know how the story would feel without the kindly, helpful eminence portrayed by Miss Cowl, try listening to a radio adaptation of No Man Of Her Own.  Screen Director's Playhouse broadcast the story with Miss Stanwyck and Mr Bettger, but without the support of  Miss Cowl, also without John Lund, Phyllis Thaxter,or Richard Denney.  Story was changed as well.  Their absence was noticeable in the broadcast--no kindly souls helping strangers-- proving  their artful contribution to the film.

Brief mention of a small but significant role played by Carole Matthews.  If you have seen her in other roles, such as the girlfriend in the film noir Man with My Face, you might be surprised by her role here.

 Another program note-- long ago, in December, 1919, a new play appeared on Broadway which was a commercial success and which became so popular with the public that the play was three times made into a movie :  1941, with Brian Aherne and  Jeannette MacDonald; 1932 with Norma Shearer and Fredric March; and a silent film in 1922 starring, the wiki says, Harrison Ford (silent films) and Norma Talmadge...

  The Broadway  play was called Smilin' Through and was written, under a pen name,  by Jane Cowl and Jane Murfin.  Somewhere in the 1930's (maybe 1934)the Lux Radio Theater presented  an  adaptation for radio of Smilin' Through, with Jane Cowl recreating her Broadway roles.

Then, in April of 1940,
Lux Radio theater presented Smilin' Through again:
 Cecil B DeMille introduced the story on the air, and the stars that evening were Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck.  I thought you'd  like to know.",1410307200,2,2088,4.9054441260744985

5028817,5,B006X0ZN3K,"It takes a great cast, director, crew and screenplay to turn a hoary story idea like this: a woman impersonating another (dead) woman, becoming part of the dead woman's family, and then getting visited by her dark and shady past - and turn it into something close to a masterpiece. Fortunately, director and uncredited contributor to the screenplay Mitchell Leisen, screenwriters Sally Benson and Catherine Turney (adapting a Cornell Woolrich novel), and principal cast Barbara Stanwyck, John Lund, Phyllis Thaxter, Jane Cowl and Lyle Bettger are around to perform the miracle, and make this into a seminal woman-in-danger noir.

As the film begins, the pregnant Stanwyck character is thrown over by scumbag boyfriend Bettger, and given a trainride out of town. On the train she meets a sympathetic couple, also about to have a child, and the woman lets her try on her wedding ring while they are in the ladies' room. You know what's going to happen now don't you? Well, if you can't guess I won't spoil it. In any case, Stanwyck is soon mistakenly adopted into a new family with her new baby, but it's a rich family, and somehow slimy Bettger finds out... Stanwyck is just marvellous in a role that calls for a lot of bewilderment and uncertainty, and only a gradual show of the kind of strength that the actress demonstrated time and again; Lund is excellent as the sympathetic brother-in-law who wants to be more, and Bettger, wow, what a great creep.  There's a bit of great location work at a train station which combines strikingly well with the Paramount sets used for the rest of it, and a lovely Olde New England stuffiness is beautifully communicated to contrast with the more modern and ""liberated"" Stanwyck character.

The Olive DVD is pretty solid looking except for a bad patch about ten minutes before the end that's a bit grainy and hissy; no extras at all, not even a trailer.  So not the greatest noir or Stanwyck release ever in terms of disc quality, but is there likely to be any kind of upgrade?  I wouldn't count on it, and the film is great enough that it's worth getting regardless.",1382486400,14,2107,4.745901639344262

5028828,5,B006X0ZN3K,"This move is so riveting. There is romance, murder, intrigue, and one is caught up in the plot from the beginning. Barbara Stanwyck plays the type of part where feel you are going through her life with her. She is truly a gifted actress. Excellent acting by everyone. This is a movie that the whole family can watch (if the younger ones can stand black and white). It was made in the days when the producer didn't need to throw in nude scenes, foul language, or blood and gore to produce an excellent movie. Also, my husband and I never saw it ending the way that it did.

Well worth watching!!",1365638400,,594,4.351351351351352

5028831,5,B006X0ZN3K,"Engrossing sort-of-noir about a woman assuming a mistaken identity by dumb luck. Stanwyck is excellent as usual, bringing the moral authority of the Mother she infused every role with. She could plead like no one else. That voice helped--along with Joan Greenwood's, Lizabeth Scott's, Lauren Bacall's and Kathleen Turner's one of the most distinctive in film history. One of the boys yet 100% woman, the strength of her genuine weakness is irresistible and on full display here.

This was Lyle Bettger's first role and he is both menacing and alluring, with leading-man good-looks and charisma to spare. This may be the only role in which he ever combined those characteristics, which is sad because he had all the goods. Lund, by comparison, is a complete bore.

I was pleasantly surprised by this film, though I needn't have been given that Mitchell Leisen directed. My one quibble was with the lengths to which the script goes to establish the innocent-victim status of Stanwyck's character. Rather heavy-handed and unnecessary, given the moral bonus points Stanwyck goes into any role with. She's good even when she's bad. Still, it would be hard to imagine the ending without our willing complicity in her good-fortune. All in all a compelling psycho-drama.",1358726400,2,1262,5.121359223300971

5028843,4,B006X0ZN3K,"I'm another one delighted to see this film finally appear on DVD.  Both the critical and the positive reviews make good points, but there are 3 big things that are terrific about this movie. Just understand going in that, largely because of production codes of the time, a fairly dark noir novel became pretty much a chick flick.

Main character Helen is, as some have pointed out, too inclined to let men use her, and to beg, but the character has lived a hard-knock life with hints of emotional deprivation. She's plausible, if not exactly a feminist role model.

First big plus is the well-dressed set, a wealthy yet cozy middle American home.  It has to evoke prosperity, without ostentation or the comedic coolness of, say, the `My Man Godfrey' kind of set.  It's a house built by the Harkness family with good hardworking American values, via Harkness Textiles.  At first sight I wanted to move in myself.

Stanwyck brings tense, conflicted dignity to a role that has to stay afloat among waves of melodrama without getting swamped. Try to imagine any other actress in this role.  There aren't many!  The plot is well-paced and tight, but some bits where she repeats a phrase over and over in inner torment (""It isn't too late, I can still back out!"" 5 times!) are quite grating and Stanwyck makes them only just bearable.  Co-screenwriter Sally Benson, better known for lighter work, shows there a weakness in her ability to translate noir from novel to screenplay, though the director bears some responsibility for the way these passages are overplayed. But the vital scenes following each suspect during the commission of the crime are beautifully put together, clear yet subtle enough that you have to pay attention.

And another perfect note, really, the linchpin of the movie, is struck by too-little-known actress Jane Cowl as matriarch Grace Harkness.  A wonderful, wonderful performance, as a grieving, loving, warm woman who indeed becomes the only real mother Helen has ever known.

The first glimpse these 2 women have of each other seals the plot.  Helen, at first, assumes Patrice's identity for her child's sake, but quickly finds that she absolutely cannot break her ""mother-in-law's"" heart, which would happen if Helen revealed that she isn't the real Patrice and that Grace has lost not only her son but his unborn child.

Helen is one of the worst identity-thieves ever, showing that she's too innately honest to pull it off, and her brother-in-law has her number almost immediately.  But affection for and desire to protect his mother stops him from exposing Helen's deception, which in turn gives him time to begin falling for Helen himself.  So Cowl, as Grace, pretty much drives the story. If the rest of it is too, as Maltin called it, ""turgid"" for you, you can watch the film for Cowl alone.

Woolrich's original plot was complex, full of darkness and ambiguity.  In simplifying the story for the film morals code of the day, it loses a lot, but the suspense is well-crafted and the contrast between Helen's lousy previous relationship and this new, loving home makes it plausible that she'd want to embrace it and rationalize doing so.

But read the book too. (Cornell Woolrich's `I Married a Dead Man`, written under his William Irish pseudonym).  Used copies are readily available, and a reprint is coming in 2013.  Despite its  same (up to a point) plot and many passages put straight into the screenplay unchanged, it's still a whole different experience.",1350950400,8,3491,4.899659863945578
5028844,4,B006X0ZN3K,"Stanwyck's films are abundantly available on dvd almost to the neglect of very famous personalities and film people of the past. Time..it tells us who made worthwhile films which tells us something about our time, or the human being, and strikes a chord, and Stanwyck was this actress...she started in the 1930's but ran out of steam in the mid 50's largely for unexplained reasons. Her box office wasn't bad, parts just dried up. Here we have a good american film genre, the film noir, and no better actress and very few could pull it off, here she is venomous and romantic, on the edge and manipulative,...the film opens with a child..some crime either mom or dad will be sent away for...she's out of the house..on a train...to nowhere...a long shot of her looking at feet..here we have the director visually impinging ideas on our understanding of the film, which is typical in film noir, and the time when scripts were not allowed to delve into some subject matters, even as late as the SEven Year Itch. In a talk a gentleman with a lady present talks of a family man...compared to the wife. A shot at Stanwyck..horrific train crash..excellent visual!! Hospitalization..identity issues..blackouts..hysteria/trauma...a series of lovers..christmas scene with message she's being chased. By whom? Who else could act the terror of her soul like Stanwyck, the helplessness...she's onthe run..her new lover husband is coming over and won't leave town without the loot...a man is shot but she was not the killer and she thought she was..but another fellow so the detective says? Surely a case of semantics since she put a bullet through a dead man's body..and dead men tale no tales...but she must make statement signed and sealed with D>A> in morning..and film's over...thanks to Olive films for bringing one of the few Stanywyck films not available to the dvd market...what other actress contemporaneous with her or even today could fill her shoes,...warner's has recently put out one of her last films with James Cagney Those wilder Years about a father going through  courts to find son...ill try to get a copy and review.",1348444800,,2123,4.980281690140845

5028851,2,B006X0ZN3K,"I must be in the minority on this one, but I found this movie to me really annoying. It was intense but I really hated Barbara Stanwycks character for this where she pleads with all the men in her life ""Ill give you anything""
Her character was spineless to me
The story is a *stolen identity* plot where Barabara Stanwyck in the role of Helen Ferguson takes on the identity of Patrice Harkness, who is part of a wealthy family when the real Mrs Harkness (& husband) are killed in a train crash. She takes the identity and tries to live with this rich family despite feeling guilty. Add a really sick ex-boyfriend of Helens to the mix in a blackmail scheme and you've got something that to me sounded interesting. What did Helen see in her ex anyway, and the role she played while he was blackmailing her to me made women look really bad the way she begged and pleaded. I couldn't wait until the end.
So it was a frusterating movie for me to watch and yes it does sound good. Most might enjoy this kind of movie and I usually do, but sometimes a character just blows it for me.
The DVD from Olive - the print is average, nothing special, Im sure they did what they could. The source material may just be really in bad shape.
This is the kind of movie that I should have rented first but it sounded like it cant miss and it did. So if you are interersted in this title, rent it before spending 18.00(+ or -)",1334016000,9,1405,4.226765799256506
