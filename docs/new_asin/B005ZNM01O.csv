When I saw this item on UK/European online stores, I found out that other bonus scenes were left out of the US version of this DVD. You won't find scenes like 'Brian's Health Scare 1974', 'Freddie Legless', 'Queen: The Beginning', 'Making Videos', and 'Queen on Tour 1974-1975' on this US version of the DVD. This just ain't fair for us the US Queen fans to have less than what we would've liked to see from this documentary. Especially from a documentary of one of the most legendary rock bands in history that is Queen! This is kind of a let-down for me.",1328572800,6,686,4.496
4911260,5,B005ZNM01O,"Queen: Days of Our Lives is the DVD to own if you want a documentary that, without any doubt, is the definitive documentary of one of the most flamboyant rock acts in history: Queen.

The documentary is a raw, gritty, informative, warts-and-all portrait of the band. It tells the story of four college students met up in 1971and started one of the world's greatest rock and roll bands. Since their forming, the band recorded an astonishing 26 albums with estimates of sales of between 150 and 300 million units.  With numbers like that, it's no mystery how and why the band's music is embedded both in the soundtrack of our youth and in our musical and societal DNA.

Directed by Matt Casey and produced by long-time Queen collaborators Simon Lupton and Rhys Thomas, it is in this DVD that, for the first time, the band shares their incredible story. The two-disc set is a treasure trove of interviews - including new interviews with Brian May and Roger Taylor - as well as recently discovered video of the band's first ever television performance and other never-before-seen archival footage.

In telling what drove this must-have documentary, Rhys Thomas said, ""We set out to make the definitive Queen documentary. It's a funny, honest, inspiring and ultimately tragic account of `a certain band called Queen, as told by the band themselves.  We tell the story of four students who met in West London, slogged hard and conquered the world, ultimately changing the world forever.""

In the UK in May, 2011, BBC broadcast Queen: Days of Our Lives over two nights to a reported 3 million viewers, resulting in it being the highest rated TV show in its time slot.

I enjoyed watching every second of each disc.  It's that good.  There are two segments that are particular Boomerocity favorites:

* Guitarist Brian May tells of bringing his parents over from the UK to see Queen perform at New York's Madison Square Garden.  It is a very, very touching vignette.

*The segments of the last recording session and color video outtakes of the music video show on this review show and tell a Freddie Mercury as his body was losing its battle against AIDS.

* The segments of the last recording session and color video outtakes of the music video show on this review show and tell a Freddie Mercury as his body was losing its battle against AIDS.

4911261,5,B005ZNM01O,"God...Freddie.

How much we need Freddie in this world today. How much we need the ""Queen"" of this documentary...

If you see NOTHING else, watch Brian talk about his dad, and playing MSG for the very first time, and ""Love of My Life"". That is as poignant, and spiritual, and lovely and wonderful piece of video as I've ever seen. And you watch Freddie's decline throughout the entire second part, and see how HARD he fought just to present a ""whole person"", where you could tell he was dying. Watching him perform the video for ""These are the Days of Our Lives"" is almost impossible to do, as poor Freddie just looks skeletal. And you hear Bri tell of a story where Freddie shows his leg to Bri while their are out on a break from a session (I'm guessing maybe it was some Kaposi's Sarcoma lesions on  the leg  or something), and Bri recoils---and yet Bri tells of Freddie actually apologizing for putting his friend and bandmate into such a position. Once again, just moving, and riveting. I'd also  never seen Roger cry---but  when he finally gets to the ""end"", he simply cannot go on. You won't be able to either. There are happy and victorious moments all throughout, but the second half is very difficult.

I really hate that Deacon John decided to skip out on the whole music Kingdom, but I respect that; however, it'd have been nice to really have his current thinking in this wonderful and sensitive documentary.

Queen is/was the smart man's Rock band. Bands from Metallica to the Foo Fighters to Bowie, to every football team (American and Soccer) around the whole world have enjoyed and been influenced by their music. This documentary is great at showing us why.

Musicians will particularly enjoy the behind the scenes stuff, and the ""layperson"" will enjoy the human interest.

This is a documentary/musical that is as important as the ""Beatles Anthology""...almost.

Don't miss it. See it...the price is amazingly inexpensive for the amount of material.

RIP, Freddie...",1328054400,71,1984,4.785923753665689
4911262,3,B005ZNM01O,"I bought this hoping for some of the vintage concert footage. Unfortunately, the clips from the 70's are only a few seconds at a time. Though an interesting documentary, there are no full length live songs played on this video,  just very short clips. I want Queen to release the entire concert (or however much is recorded) of some of the great 3 second clips that are on this video such as the '77 concert at Madison Sq Garden. Brain...i  would pay a lot of $ for them:)",1327968000,,472,4.3522727272727275
4911263,5,B005ZNM01O,"A very good documentary - told in two chapters (you can watch them individually or consecutively) on the standard DVD. It's interesting to hear Brian May and Roger Taylor talk about Freddie's illness, and although they don't specifically say how early Mercury knew he had HIV/AIDS, they hint that he may have known as early as during the pre-concert rehearsals for LIVE AID in 1985. And Queen did rehearse - a lot - for LIVE AID, which I hadn't heard before. Some of that rehearsal footage is seen here.

Highlights include music-video ""rushes"" that feature alternate angles, takes and behind-the-scenes shots of Queen making their videos. The most shocking is a frail Mercury, in pain, standing up, for the ""These Are the Days of Our Lives"" video. The on-the-set color footage, showing Mercury waiting for the camera to start, is haunting. His sharp jawline (from AIDS) looks like it could cut through steel. Mercury's left eye is noticeably blood shot, and he looks plain ill, yet he pulled off one of his greatest on-screen performances for the music video.
It's nice to see the black-and-white film footage of Queen actually recording part of their ""News of the World"" album in 1977, and the 1976 live Hyde Park footage, although shown only in a couple too-brief segments, is magnificent. Footage of Queen's 1977 tour also is examined, through footage that wonderfully blends old videotape footage with film footage of the same gig.

I also learned of Roger Taylor's hatred for the ""Hot Space"" songs that sported dance-like beats, and how Queen almost broke up in 1982/83.

One of rock's greatest mysteries, though, has to be a now-missing-in-action John Deacon, Queen's bassist, who, for some reason, refused to take part in this documentary, as he has in all things Queen-related over the last several years. Is Deacon still alive? Anyone seen or heard from him? Supposedly Deacon gave May and Taylor his blessing to carry on with the Queen legacy, yet there's no word at all from Deacon. Was there any bad blood? Taylor was quoted a few years ago saying something like ""You'll have to ask John about that, and I don't think he's in the right place to talk about that now."" Maybe a bit of bad blood exists on John's part?",1326844800,31,2227,4.824607329842932
4911264,4,B005ZNM01O,"Queen 40 years, that was 2011, the reissues, the box sets, books and documentaries, all flooding the market.
Among them this little documentary gem, released in the UK (mid January 2012 release date set for here in the US) on region free Blu ray disc.
There has been some consternation about the fact that the BD runs longer than the trimmed DVD release, and I can offer no insight. The BD has nice picture and sound, but is by no means stunning, most of the footage shown in the documentary is old and not restored, or upgraded to HD, so it's a good picture, not a stunning one.
The main feature is a two part documentary charting the beginnings of the band, through to their last live performance in 1986, and then what came next.
Most of the footage is narrated in interview style with Brian May, and Roger Taylor mostly. John Deacon (the bass player) seeming to have disappeared intentionally from the public eye, is not seen much, and the footage of Freddie is obviously old.

There is quite a bit of new footage, some unseen screen tests for videos, and the unseen live aid practice, all padded out with a chronology of hits, shows, ups and downs.
It was interesting to learn about some of the inner turmoil, the quiet solo attempts, not only from Freddie, but Brian and Roger also.
There are many interesting interviews with the likes of Paul Gambucinni, long time roadie Peter Hince, and their former manager, as well as news reports, clips covering the highs and the lows.
The immense crowds of South America, the mistake of Sun City, the long time break through to the USA, and so on.

The second part of the documentary deals with the high points, virtual split and then masterful reunion for Live Aid, and the massive '86 tour.
It also deals with Freddie's health, decline and ultimate end, and though delicately handled, it is sad and very bittersweet.

So 40 years? Well yes and no, 25 years since their last live concert as a complete band, and 20 years since the death of Freddie, yet here we are - still absorbed, still watching.
Arguably one of the greatest rock bands of the 20th century, certainly one, if not THE founders of ""stadium"" rock, who left an endearing legacy of great music.

Much of the the footage can be seen in other documentaries like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Queen-Under-Review-1980-1991/dp/B000FWGVW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Queen - Under Review - 1980-1991</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Queen-Under-Review-1973-1980/dp/B000BDH65S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Queen - Under Review 1973-1980</a>&nbsp;but these are mostly the ramblings of other people.

4911305,5,B005ZNM01O,"This video tells their story from before the days of Queen to after through the use of old interviews, music clips, and modern interviews with mostly the guitarist and drummer.  It was released in 2011 and effectively covers Queen up to that date.  Long time Queen fans will know most of this material but anyone new to Queen, if anyone like that exists, will find this video gripping.  The background of many of their best known songs and different recording locations are discussed.  This documentary is professionally done and of great modern quality.  The music clips are tastefully long and in sync with the video. The audiences start small and increase to stadium size.  There are 2 one-hour parts to the main documentary with several video extras but you will probably want to watch it all in one evening.  There are 3 documentary extras about 20 minutes long total.  And there are 7 song performance videos about 35 minutes long total, all of good quality, not just add-ons.  The enclosed booklet is a single folded item containing mostly credits and not much other info.  The back of the case has a little history info and can be read in a minute.

I enjoyed it very much as I like the history of Queen and the diverse personalities of the band members.  Each member contributes to their story with not only talent but intelligence.

The ending was difficult to watch but needed.  It's a very good reminder that we all have struggles and must carry on as best we can.  We never know where or how our lives will end.",1373328000,,455,4.125
4911331,4,B005ZNM01O,"Queen 40 years, that was 2011, the reissues, the box sets, books and documentaries, all flooding the market.
Among them this little documentary gem, released in the UK (mid January 2012 release date set for here in the US) on region free Blu ray disc.
There has been some consternation about the fact that the BD runs longer than the trimmed DVD release, and I can offer no insight. The BD has nice picture and sound, but is by no means stunning, most of the footage shown in the documentary is old and not restored, or upgraded to HD, so it's a good picture, not a stunning one.
The main feature is a two part documentary charting the beginnings of the band, through to their last live performance in 1986, and then what came next.
Most of the footage is narrated in interview style with Brian May, and Roger Taylor mostly. John Deacon (the bass player) seeming to have disappeared intentionally from the public eye, is not seen much, and the footage of Freddie is obviously old.

There is quite a bit of new footage, some unseen screen tests for videos, and the unseen live aid practice, all padded out with a chronology of hits, shows, ups and downs.
It was interesting to learn about some of the inner turmoil, the quiet solo attempts, not only from Freddie, but Brian and Roger also.
There are many interesting interviews with the likes of Paul Gambucinni, long time roadie Peter Hince, and their former manager, as well as news reports, clips covering the highs and the lows.
The immense crowds of South America, the mistake of Sun City, the long time break through to the USA, and so on.

The second part of the documentary deals with the high points, virtual split and then masterful reunion for Live Aid, and the massive '86 tour.
It also deals with Freddie's health, decline and ultimate end, and though delicately handled, it is sad and very bittersweet.

So 40 years? Well yes and no, 25 years since their last live concert as a complete band, and 20 years since the death of Freddie, yet here we are - still absorbed, still watching.
Arguably one of the greatest rock bands of the 20th century, certainly one, if not THE founders of ""stadium"" rock, who left an endearing legacy of great music.

Much of the the footage can be seen in other documentaries like Queen - Under Review - 1980-1991 and Queen - Under Review 1973-1980 but these are mostly the ramblings of other people. This BD has probably the most real input from the band, mostly Roger and Brian as already mentioned, but for any fan, or anyone who simply wants to know more about the band, it's certainly worth the money.",1372204800,,2597,4.5665236051502145

The interviews were mostly of Brian and Roger and others that actually knew them all during that time.  Many documentaries, I wonder just how much some of the people knew them, or are of fans reactions to stuff.

The part where Brian and Roger describe Freddie's illness and eventual demise were beyond touching.  Had me in tears.

A COMPREHENSIVE look into their lives, their artistry and the MAJESTY that was FREDDY MERCURY.
I can't say enough good about this dvd. It covers so much and contains so much rare footage that very few have ever seen. I LOVED IT. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.
The MUSIC and PERFORMANCES are INCREDIBLE, TRULY INCREDIBLE. AND THERE IS SO VERY MUCH MORE. I SO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!! Seeing QUEEN is not just watching a concert--Queen, and especially FREDDY MERCURY, is a full blown STAGESHOW. Their shows were ""PRODUCTIONS"".

4911350,3,B005ZNM01O,"This is the kind of rock documentary that is more for the casual Queen fan, and not the hardcore fan that would expect the group to go into greater detail of other tracks from their albums.

The main part of this documentary are in two ""one hour"" parts.  Part One covered their most powerful and popular era of their career.  The seventies.  From Queen's debut album up to ""The Game"", which is my main concerned era of the band.  But, to talk about 8 great albums in only one hour, caused them to only discuss the hit songs from these eight albums, and they didn't even mention all the many hits of that era.  If you had this documentary, and only their ""greatest hits"" CD, and if you knew nothing else of Queen, you would really only get into the first hour of this documentary.

I wanted to hear more about the fabulous songs on ""Sheer Heart Attack"", ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""Day at the Races"" and a discussion and perhaps some session performances of these tracks in the raw. The bonus extras talk a little bit more about the separate albums, but very little.  I really wanted to have more.

Now, on the Part Two of the main documentary, they started strong with ""Under Pressure"" with David Bowie, but then quickly revolved in the band losing their familiar style and appeal to the rock world, and then also, the quick decline or Freddie Mercury's health.  They spent a long portion of an hour on that subject alone.  It dragged, and it even bored me, but most of all, it depressed me.  I wanted to hear a celebration of the works of ""Queen"", not go deeply into Freddie Mercury's declining health, and to see his sickly final moments. I found part two of this documentary extremely ""unentertaining"". They had a few successful concerts, but their albums through the eighties weren't selling their sound like they had in the seventies.

There is an excellent DVD on ""Queen: the making of ""A Night at the Opera"".  Now, I would love to have a separate DVD of all eight of their first albums, individually. But, that's not gonna happen.

I have Queen's CD box set ""The Crown Jewels"" (the first eight albums), and I have their Blu-Ray release of their 1982 concert in Montreal, Canada.  I guess that's all the Queen that I need.  I probably won't play this Queen documentary again, unless I were to have a friend over who'd like to watch it.  I would certainly give a verbal fore-warning because this documentary can leave you feeling depressed about the legacy of Queen.  I've seen things now, that I wish I hadn't.

So, be prepared for some emotional disappointment with this documentary.  You certainly won't stand up and cheer. And that's a fact.",1338336000,8,2650,4.548523206751055

The scenes talking about Freddie's last days were heart wrenching and inspiring to say the least.

4911357,5,B005ZNM01O,"Quiet an extraordinary form to pay tribute to one of the greatest Rock vocalist of all ages. Is really an exclusive experience to really get to know more about the Queen band; because, if you remember, there were always an incredible silence and hermetism with a lot of things and circumstances concerning within the band. Not only about Freddie Mercury!!!... My experience with this video buster (for real Queen fans) was the experimentation of very intense feelings, it's really and emotive film that shows the human side of four big musicians; from the situation of Brian with his father about being a musician (""Thank you Madison Square Garden...""), to the Freddie's goodbye with the video filmation of the track ""These Are The Days Of Our Lives"" and his final passing away (I was really crying with all that situations, like if all the situations just had happened!)... Since my very young years I have been a real Queen Fan that love almost all the Queen Music... It's a very introspective video with a lot of friends and media broadcast people that coments about the band's career, songs, and every aspect of the fab four monarchy. Plus several amazing new footage clips of classic songs like ""Somebody to Love"" or ""We Are The Champions"" just to name two videos that I really enjoy again like it was yesterday... Very recomended!

And there is another part of the band's story, a thing that was not revealed before, and it's about the unrespectfull relatioship between the English press and Queen... As I can tell, through my real experience with the media: the truth is that behind all that image of fashion in some of the mediums (in this case the english Press), there are a lot of selfish interests of the editors, writers, managers, etc. prove to all of this, is the Brian May's video comment: "" Maybe if you got too succesful too quick, as they thought, there was a resentment there that they hadn't made you, therefore they wanted to break you""... Nowadays the thing is that there is no more good Rock music, no more good Rock bands at all in this planet. because all that have airplay by radio or T.V. are created by people that really don't mind the Rock music but just the plastic and their money interests. and It's really a shame!. I really miss all that classic bands, I miss Freddie Mercury and I miss Queen (A good complement for this DVD film is ""The Making of A Night At The Opera"" (from Classic Albums label) that was release a few years ago)...

4911358,5,B005ZNM01O,"Fans of Queen will not be disappointed one bit by ""Queen: Days Of Our Lives."" (Q:DOOL) Frankly, fans of music in general will not be disappointed either!

Starting at the very beginning of Queen (Smile, Ibex, Sour Milk Sea, etc.) ""Q:DOOL"" takes viewers on the inside track to the band, from friendships and relationships, to rows and egos, to making some of the finest music ever recorded. With new interviews and insight from Brian May and Roger Taylor, this documentary is every fan's dream. You'll hear stories from the early days, their days of rising success, the days of being on top of the world, life on the road and in the studio, as well as the struggles that came part and parcel with all of that. You'll also see newly discovered, rare performance and interview footage from all four members of the band. It should be noted that John Deacon does not appear in new interview footage and, in fact, neither does Freddie Mercury since he (in a nod to Monty Python) insists on remaining dead.

This is not a Freddie Mercury documentary. (If that's what you're looking for try ""Freddie Mercury: Lover of Life, Singer of Songs."") This documentary provides some of his backstory but for the most part ties it into the band and his life with respect to the band. Another nice thing is that they don't dwell on his sexuality the whole time. Too often that becomes the focus of Queen docs and they made certain to acknowledge it but not beat the dead horse about it. You'll hear the personal stories of Brian and Roger coping with the news of Freddie's health, his decline and non-stop professionalism, and the ultimate loss of their friend, family member, and working partner.

If you love music and you love Queen, you will love this. The Blu-ray edition does come with added extras such as music videos and extended interviews but even the standard DVD is well worth your attention.",1330905600,3,1886,4.674698795180723

4911364,4,B005ZNM01O,"Eagle Vision continues its string of great music-lovers DVDs with their release of Queen - Days of our Lives on Blu-ray.

Since the death of flamboyant front man Freddie Mercury from AIDS in 1991 Queen's popularity, remarkably, has persisted. Fox's Glee featured a show with songs from Queen. Their big hit, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" had a bit of a renaissance thanks to the prominent and hilarious use in the 1992 movie Wayne's World. There was also George Michael's top-of-the-charts cover of ""Somebody to Love"" in 1992. American Idol reunited the band to back up the two finalists for a rendition of ""We are the Champions"" capping off the highly rated Adam Lambert season. Queen also toured for four years with Bad Company's Paul Rodgers to sold out stadiums around the globe.

In terms of significance however, nothing trumps Queen's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. While this might not have silenced all the critics who claimed Queen was an overly theatrical version of Muzak - it certainly justifies a long form documentary.

This BBC produced 2 hour documentary will delight fans. It also makes a case for reconsidering this band of college chums who sold over 100 million records. Taking a chronological approach it visits the early days of at Cambridge and how they really took off when they added lead singer/pianist Farrokh Bulsara (aka Freddie Mercury). Freddie was lightning in a bottle and arguably one of the greatest front men in the history of rock and roll. His Live Aid performance was a master class in what it means to be a rock star.

But the story goes deeper than Mercury. Each of the four band members wrote hit songs. This is unusual. So too is guitarist Brian May's PhD in Astrophysics. Loaded with interviews old and new, this is a well paced and never boring production. Of particular interest to fans will be the interviews with reclusive bassist John Deacon. While they are old - he no longer participates in the band - they are illuminating. So too are all the interviews which are articulate and heart felt.

Make no mistake though, it is a sad story that revolves around Mercury. He was the real deal. He could write hit songs, produce, sing, and play a very accomplished piano. He was also a front man whose gayness somehow didn't diminish his power or appeal. Sadly, his death will always define the band.

So check it out - 4 stars for must see music documentary!",1329004800,2,2417,4.742857142857143
4911365,5,B005ZNM01O,"With all the others reviews here - especially the one posted already by Poetmater - I won't go into the details of this DVD which includes the two-part, two-hour documentary made for, and broadcast by, the BBC plus nearly an hour of bonus materials including 3 deleted scenes and 7 videos. I did note from another review that there are a significant number of additional deleted scenes on the Bluray version but, since I was sent the standard DVD version, I cannot comment on them. Hardcore Queen fans - of which there are many - may want to opt for the BD. As for me, I really enjoyed their music but was more of a casual fan during their tenure so I actually learned things new to me from the extensive contemporary interviews with the band members, their manager and the various producers, plus a few music journalists.

I've seen at least one of the Under Review titles about the band but they tend to have more journalists and virtually no band members and the quality of the performance video in the UR Dvds is just ""ok"".

So, from the standpoint of the casual Queen fan, this one gets 5 stars from me - as much of the BBC-TV quality is here.

What a great singer/entertainer...he is so sorely missed.",1523059200,,278,4.58

8489883,5,B005ZNM01O,"Bought during one of my recent Queen phases, this has to be one of the best band documentaries I've seen in quite awhile. Split into two one hour parts (with an additional hour of doc as extras), this pretty much covers their active years in full album/tour detail, plus the first five after Mercury's passing. Professionally made by the BBC back in the late 2000's, the picture and audio (especially the audio) are really excellent. A must see for any Queen fan & has almost another hour of videos/behind the scenes too (be careful of the ""later year"" behind the scenes though, Freddie really didn't look well on ""video"" at this time-film hid a lot of it, but Blu Ray's clarity exposes it.). Tons of interviews by the band and those that knew them, if you thought you knew a lot of this band, this Blu might surprise you.",1504656000,2,822,4.523489932885906
