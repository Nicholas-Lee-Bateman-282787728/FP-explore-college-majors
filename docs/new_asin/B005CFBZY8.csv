Echo Bridge Home Entertainment, the company that produces this DVD, gives the following synopses for each film. I take no credit for writing them. I've just included them as a courtesy.

4652644,3,B005CFBZY8,The movies in this movie pack are all older movies. Some decent and others that are not decent. Would not purchase again.,1349308800,2,121,4.545454545454546
4652645,5,B005CFBZY8,"I found this in the $5 DVD bin at Walmart and bought it primarily just for ""The Beastmaster,"" which has been out-of-print on itself for quite some time now. I watched ""The Beastmaster"" upon arriving at home and was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of the picture and sound! It is presented here in Widescreen format and appears digitally remastered. I haven't watched the other five movies in their entirety yet, but I scanned through them to see how they look and they all look excellent as well. This is definitely a great bargain for anyone looking for some good-looking fantasy films at a good low price!",1330992000,30,616,4.712962962962963
8465194,2,B005CFBZY8,You would figure that if you got 6 in 1 that there would be something worth seeing more than once. But in this case you would be wrong. Not only are these movies dated they fail to stand the test of time.  I would say that children might enjoy them  but that is doubtful with all the new computer graphic imagining in todays movies to compete against. Don't even bother to watch them on free TV.,1408752000,,395,4.184210526315789
8465195,4,B005CFBZY8,"I obtained this product to view a particular film.  the pack having a variety of action and fantasy films might be of interest to people who
have an interest in this type film.",1408406400,,176,4.333333333333333

THANK SO MUCH.",1403395200,,96,5.0625
8465197,3,B005CFBZY8,"A mixed bag of movies but a great collection to put in to play Magic the Gathering in the background by or when your D&D group can't make it. My order of favorites is Midnight Chronicles, Beastmaster, Beowulf, Merlin & the Dragons, Dragonquest and Warriors of Virtue. The last two are made better if you play MST3K.",1399161600,,315,4.543859649122807
8465198,3,B005CFBZY8,Two of the movies (one each disk) have disk read issues though there are no visible scratches/damage on the disk,1398643200,,112,4.65
8465199,4,B005CFBZY8,"I bought this specifically for the Beastmaster. I started watching one of the other movies and about 30 minutes into it, I remembered why I had never heard of any of the others. They are horrible. And if you are one of those that thinks The Beastmaster is a horrible film (no real arguments here), then the rest is truly a waste of good celluloid. Or a few hours.

However, if you are considering a ""Bad Movie Night"", some of these might definitely fit the bill.",1393891200,,462,4.372093023255814
8465200,4,B005CFBZY8,"I mainly purchased this set of fantasy films for The Beastmaster only. I tried to watch the other junk included in this set, but I could not watch any of them besides Dragonquest which was still pretty cheesy and lame. The Beastmaster is a classic 80's fantasy film about a warrior who has mind powers, and he can talk to animals through telepathy. I consider The Beastmaster film a good adventure film, and recommended if you're looking for a cheap way to get The Beastmaster on DVD.",1392249600,,484,4.574712643678161
8465201,3,B005CFBZY8,"Bought this for BeastMaster and based on other's reviews, thought I'd enjoy the other 5 movies.
First, BeastMaster - good copy of it, pretty much what I expected.
The other movies - so far three were so horrid, I couldn't make it past 5 minutes.
Haven't watched Beowulf or Warriors of Tao, but hard to imagine based on the plot, they could be any good.
Plus, Christopher Lambert isn't my favorite actor to begin with.  Highlander was good, but I haven't enjoyed any of his other stuff....",1389830400,,488,4.609195402298851
8465202,4,B005CFBZY8,"THE BEASTMASTER
The prince of a family slaughtered by lords of evil, Dar must embark on a perilous journey to seek his revenge on a villainous priest.
My review:The Beastmaster spawned two sequels & a television series, to boot, so that should tell you how good this movie is. It's Marc singer's most talked about role, after all. Great movie-loved it.

DRAGONQUEST
When a mythological beast is awakened by a warlord ready to conquer the world, a young Keeper must summon his powers to battle the greatest force of evil.
My review:Another movie starring Marc Singer. Overall, it's a pretty decent effort. One of the better Asylum films out there. Thought, at first, it was a movie based on the popular videogame series but it isn't. Great watch for those into Dragons and whatnot.

MERLIN AND THE WAR OF THE DRAGONS
Britain, 420 A.D. The Dark Ages have begun. It's a time of legends and violence...and also a time of magic, mythical creatures, and of an exceptional wizard, Merlin.
My review:Even though some liberties were taken with the story of Merlin and all, it was still an awesome watch. Jurgen Prochnow did an outstanding performance as The Mage. Enjoyed every moment of it.

BEOWULF
Beowulf is half man-half god and must fight to the death in order to quell the raging violence hidden deep in his own bedeviled soul.
My review:Loosely based on the poem Beowulf, this version takes liberties with it by placing it in a post-apocalyptic future. Christopher Lambert, of Highlander fame, does a great job in the film. However, the film isn't so great itself. All I can say is to watch it and you'll see what I mean. It reminds me more of a campy version of Mad Max than a genuine version of Beowulf.

MIDNIGHT CHRONICLES
In a world ruled by evil, an oppressed kingdom fears for its life. The evil intensifies when a legate goes missing and a fellow priest, sent to investigate, discovers a haunting secret.
My review:Based on the RPG, Midnight, this movie was made with the intentions of being used as a pilot for a television series but was passed over so it remains as a stand-alone movie. Honestly, after watching it, I can't see why it was never picked up and made into one. It's a great movie, well-acted, one that fans of the RPG series will definitely love.

WARRIORS OF VIRTUE: THE RETURN TO TAO
Ryan and Chucky are taken to the parallel universe of Tao, where they learn to become Warriors of Virtue.
My review:The only sequel in this collection, Warriors of Virtue: The Return To Tao is an excellent kid's Martial Arts movie that takes what made the original  so special and attempts to one-up it(and for the most part succeeds) despite the horrible acting. I loved it!

Overall review: This collection of low-budget movies is actually, for lack of a better term, a 'steal'. I, myself, purchased this from the bargain bin at Wal-Mart for a five-spot. Every last movie is a guaranteed enjoyable watch. Least, it was for me. There wasn't one in the whole bunch that I didn't like in some way. Not only that but the sound and picture quality is outstanding.

I hope that Echo Bridge Home Entertainment continues to release movie collections such as these at the low and affordable prices they have. Truth be known, I've got quite a few of their releases in my DVD collection(so much so that they have a shelf of their own). If you're someone who loves to watch movies, regardless of what genre they're in, I highly recommend you hunt down some of Echo Bridge's collection releases. I hadn't purchased one yet that I felt was a waste of my hard-earned money.",1370476800,2,3652,4.794912559618442
8465203,5,B005CFBZY8,"I bought this to add to my Mom & My fantasy collection. I saw Beastmaster as a kid and loved it then, and was happy to have seen it again. great value. The other movies are pretty decent too.",1367107200,2,191,3.923076923076923
