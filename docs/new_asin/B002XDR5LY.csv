8383618,5,B002XDR5LY,"Apparently this film was not enthusiastically received when it was originally released, in 1929, as it had not fully embraced sound, and America was very quickly becoming talky-crazy. But it was released with an effective music soundtrack (as it is shown here), probably for its release in the newly-speechified theaters. Remember that not all theaters had been converted at this time, especially those far from big cities, so this transitional film could easily be shown in them with a pianist or small ensemble accompanying. Otherwise, I can't really add to what the earlier reviewers have written, as they have already described the film and its merits quite effectively, especially the perceptive comment comparing Gilbert here to Errol Flynn. Really tragic that he was not successful into the '30s, and was soon destroyed by his alcoholism.",1451260800,,845,5.266666666666667

8383620,4,B002XDR5LY,"enjoyable but very strange gilbert film no dashing heroics here.just gilbert and the desert as its backdrop,silent film with sound effects. the picture is crystal clear photographed by the great james wong howe and mary nolan is the very beautiful blonde villain,ernest torrence is her partner who provides a few comic moments but the great john gilbert is at his best.the movie moves at a fast clip not a long movie but very entertaining.",1371254400,5,439,4.945945945945946
8383621,3,B002XDR5LY,"This film only went for a hour which was disappointing.  Nevertheless it was a chance to see a late silent movie which is  entertaining.  John Gilbert is very charasmatic in this one, it makes one realise why he was such a big star.  Also you get to see him in cute shorts.  No wonder the girl can't resist.",1315094400,3,307,4.224137931034483
8383622,5,B002XDR5LY,"This film is a little bit different from Gilbert's other silent films. Usually Gilbert was cast in films in which there was a tremendous amount of action and/or romance. This time, much of the film is just Gilbert in a somewhat psychological battle against two thieves and the elements.

Gilbert plays Hugh Rand, manager of a South African diamond mine. He gets news that two visitors are due - Lord Stonehill and his daughter Diana. They arrive ahead of schedule, and against Rand's own predictions Lady Diana turns out to be a beautiful woman. However, it soon turns out that the two are imposters, but are found out by Rand before he can notify anyone else. The pair of thieves take off into the desert with their stolen diamond and their company of co-conspirators with Rand as hostage.

Things begin to go wrong for the thieves, and pretty soon it is just Rand and the two imposters on foot, in search of water before the sun of the desert does them in. Throughout their journey Rand is laughing off the situation as well as laughing at the two thieves, now suddenly penitent and afraid of death. Rand has a right to laugh - he has control of the last canteen of water.

Gilbert often reminds me - in this and his other silent films - of Errol Flynn, showing temper and passion when it is called for, but usually laughing in the face of danger, having a genuinely good time in whatever situation he is put, and inviting us to join in the adventure with him. I've often wondered what would have become of his career had he been ten years younger and started out in talking pictures instead of silent film. Would he have been MGM's answer to Flynn in the age of the swashbuckling picture?

This is a Warner Archive product. Thus it is a DVD-R with no extra features and no chapter stops. You can only go forward and backwards in ten minute increments. Even though no special restoration has been done for this film, it really looks quite crisp and clear. Highly recommended for the silent film enthusiast.",1265068800,9,2008,4.538674033149171
