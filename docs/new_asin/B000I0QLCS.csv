8142768,3,B000I0QLCS,"This often silly romantic tale stars Maggie Q from ""Mission Impossible 3"" & next year's ""Die Hard 4."" Maggie plays Clary who rents a room in a Chinese flat. Terence Yin from ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"" plays the romantic lead who is transferred into this Chinese town. The landlord, the cop & Clary set up a scam to scare Yin out of the house by making him believe it is haunted so they can rent it again. There is a lot of dressing up in crazy attire, but this is not a spooky tale. Yin moves to his Aunt's house who also sets up a scam of accusing him of taking advantage his cousin so she can have an excuse to boot him out of the house. With nowhere to go, he returns to his flat to discover the first scam. Yin's buddies set up retro-scam and pretend to take advantage of Q. She then scams the scammers, which results in Yin taking care of a catatonic Clary. After the plot bounces back & forth a few times, the frame freezes just as Yin leans in for the big kiss. This entertaining lightweight romp teases more than delivers. Enjoy!",1164326400,5,1035,4.206030150753769
