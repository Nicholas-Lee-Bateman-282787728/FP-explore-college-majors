545121,5,6302995876,"The first foreign language film I ever saw was ""That Man From Rio"" and it was a great way to start. I went because it had been billed as being in the style of Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"". There are superficial similarities, but the French film is more than capable of being judged on its own merits - of which there are many. It certainly has its tongue farther in its cheek than Hitch ever managed.
A great deal of the film's success is due to the charisma and sheer star quality of Jean-Paul Belmondo, then in his prime and thoroughly enjoying himself. He seems to be constantly on the move - running, jumping, climbing, fighting - pausing only to deliver a droll line of dialogue or two or to share a kiss with the delectable Francois Dorleac (sister of Catherine Deneuve and, in my opinion, far sexier).
The plot - some nonsense about lost treasure - begins in Paris, then takes a rollercoaster ride to Rio, the eerie cityscape of (then new) Brasilia, and on into the Amazon jungle. Cliche after cliche is employed and parodied - and done as well or better than in the subsequent Bond films. Through it all, Belmondo is the perfect comic book hero - dirty, confused, bloodied, but never out of breath and always triumphant.
After going for too many years without seeing this film, I was delighted to finally find it on video. And equally pleased to confirm that it has lost none of its fun or charm. In fact, in many ways, it seems considerably less dated than many American or British films from the same period. This may be because director Philippe de Broca, while very inventive, does not overdo all the sixties camera tricks and artsy techniques so fashionable in that decade. ""That Man From Rio"" is a joy to watch and still one of the best comedy/thrillers ever made. I cannot praise Belmondo or de Broca enough. And I can only lament that Francois Dorleac's career was cut so tragically short.",1022803200,38,1909,4.568513119533527
545122,4,6302995876,"The advice is simple - don't take it seriously and you'll enjoy it immensely! The scenarios are quite improbable which enhances the spoof effect. Very erotic too, but not a sex scene or even a naked body in sight.
And let's be honest - the luscious Lola would turn any red-blooded male into a hood!",997920000,7,298,4.4363636363636365
545123,5,6302995876,"First,""The man of Rio"" is a very well done comedy and a nice  adventure story, although the archeological facts are fully invented. It's  pleasant to see these wonderfull actors playing the french 60's way, which  was , dynamic, young and with a good rythm. This film will make you do a  wonderfull smilly travel in the world and in time. It take place in Paris  in the 60's and go on in the Brasil of the the 60's, and especially in Rio  de Janeiro, which was still magic at this time. You will even see that  somme scenes had been made in the city of Brasilia when it was under  construction...That makes the film a bit historical...for brazilian  people...
Anyway, don't miss one of the monuments of the french 60's  ""nouvelle vague"".",962582400,15,737,4.515151515151516
545124,1,6302995876,"It is a waste to have Belmondo on such a film. Even after the film is over we are still asking what was the point...It is not funny, has no meaning, trips from one cliche to another, and wastes our time. At least Belmondo  got paid to do this film. We should be paid for to watch it!",962409600,,283,3.8793103448275863
545125,5,6302995876,"I saw this movie many years ago and I still take pleasure in watching it over again. The script is superb the music (Georges Delerue I think) splendid and the cast is simply marvelous. One wishes more of De Broca's  pictures were available particularly ""Male Companion""--the one  sadness is watching the wonderful Francois Dorleac who died so young. A  great story, a great spoof a winner,",962409600,8,389,4.863636363636363
545201,5,6302995876,"I am not going to go into any of the virtues of this zany French classic. This is intended for those of you who want to own this flik but are hesitant about the Korean Import. Well, it is ALL REGIONS and will play on any US DVD player. The print could be a little sharper, but I suspect this is the way it looked on its origial theatrical release, when European film processing was not as up to snuff as it is today. But the best thing about this release is that it is totally ANAMORPHIC: it will fill your entire widescreen flat panel. There is some overscanning at the top and bottom. The English subtitles are easy to turn on from the main menu, or from your remote Subtitle Button after the film has started. Why no American distributor has deigned to release this gem is a mystery to me, but until Criterion or whoever decides to, this Korean import will do quite nicely. BTW, I've never been disappointed with any Korean DVD of any European or Hollywood classic. Another thing, I bought it  online and directly from Seoul and paid only $8.50 plus about $3 for the shipping.",1390262400,,1079,4.3681592039801

545204,5,6302995876,"I saw this movie on TV in the late sixties. It was in French with English subtitles. I was pleasantly surprised to see it listed at an affordable price. The last time I checked Amazon the only copy available was listed for over $100 which was way more than I wanted to spend.

The DVD I received was the Russian version so the menu was in Russian.

The vendor thoughtfully included instructions for setting it up to play in French with English subtitles they way I remembered it.

I got this three days after ordering it using standard shipping.

Great vendor.",1375228800,,560,4.514851485148514
545205,4,6302995876,"When this film first came out, I was only marginally aware of Jean-Paul Belmondo. It was the 60's and James Bond was kicking tail so there were spoofs a-plenty. This is one of the best. DeBroca is a French romp creator and after you see one of his movies, you're out searching for more.

Starring as Belmondo's love interest is Francoise Dorleac who was Catherine Deneuve's older sister and died tragically at 25 as her sports car flipped on a road in Nice, France. The two stars were superb together and brought the script alive.

This movie should be out on DVD in original French with English subtitles. The movie I bought was Russian with English dubbed...not exactly the best way to see any foreign film.  But dubbed is better than no movie at all so I LOVED watching this for the second time in 40 years!

HIGHLY recommended!",1364169600,,831,4.557046979865772
545206,2,6302995876,"Considering all the talent involved and its huge international success, L'Homme de Rio aka That Man from Rio is a bit of a damp squib that never offers half as much fun as it promises. One of Philippe de Broca and Jean-Paul Belmondo's crowd pleasers and heavily influenced by the Tintin books, it's a surprisingly lazy affair carried out with a rather leaden touch, especially badly edited with some poor photography that doesn't even make much of the opportunities its exotic location offers. Belmondo's the AWOL soldier who follows his kidnapped girlfriend Francoise Dorleac to Rio, where - after what seems like an eternity of exposition - the bad guys want her to find one of three rare statues hidden by her father that are the key to the location of a fabulous treasure.

Despite Cyrano de Bergerac's Jean-Paul Rappeneau being among the quartet of screenwriters who were rewarded with an Oscar nomination for their efforts, the script's a particularly clodhopping affair, the two stars having little in the way of chemistry as they squabble their way through South America, Dorleac so severely overestimating her charm that her increasingly unlikeable heroine simply doesn't seem worth the bother of rescuing and Belmondo in particular wildly overcompensating with bullish overconfidence that tramples over the script's better moments. Even his usual daring stunts aren't always showcased as well as they could be. Things pick up a bit in the second half, but it's never less than heavy going. Still, JFK seemed to like it...

The NTSC DVD from Asia isn't quite top quality, but it's acceptable - especially considering that it's so hard to find with English subtitles - the PAL French and at least one of the Russian DVDs have no English language option, so be careful which one you go for.",1351900800,2,1797,4.986666666666666
545207,5,6302995876,"I have always loved this movie, and it stands the test of time - Belmondo is showing his talent as a naturally entertaining actor, and the setting of Rio de Janeiro in the 60ies is unbelievable. It gets all my thumbs up! If you love the 60ies and French movies, it doesn't get any better than that!",1337644800,2,298,4.245614035087719

545210,5,6302995876,"I saw That Man From Rio in a New York movie theatre when it was first released and fell madly in love with both stars.  When I found this DVD I was delighted but surprised when it arrived and I discovered it was Russian.  Even though it came with instructions as to how to get to the English subtitles I was afraid it would be dubbed from French into Russian and then translated into English.  This was not the case.  In fact the English subtitles were already on the screen and the characters speak French. (Jean Paul Belmondo speaking Russian would have been mind blowing but kind of funny.)  The quality is excellent and the movie is still tremendous fun. Age has not diminished it at all.
This movie came out before the Harrison Ford ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" series and has a sophistication and charm those movies lacked.  Francoise Dorleac is radiant and delightful. The scene with her dancing on the beach in Rio is priceless, as is Belmondo's look of Gallic frustration. Dorleac had a sense of fun and mischief I have never seen in her more serious twin sister.  Her early death was a great loss.
Belmondo is perfection.  He is a brilliant physical comedian.  His character often appears to be almost simple and yet he is indomitable in his determination to rescue Dorleac.
Belmondo moves like a panther.  He is still about the sexiest thing on the screen even though there is only one kiss and not much more implied.
I did not remember this movie being so innocent and actually, very sweet, and yet so very, very funny at the same time.  The writing is smart, the acting is consistently excellent and I am very glad I hunted down this DVD.",1280707200,14,1648,4.515151515151516

This is one of my very favorite movies, with non-stop action and crazy situations.

545224,4,6302995876,"A fun film that I actually saw in a REAL theater at the time of its release . (no kidding!)  Belmondo is very nice to look at and hams his way from location to location, including an exciting chase scene through a still being built Brasilia. The plot is as mindless as any James Bond film but the characters are fun and this picture never takes itself too seriously. The point of this review is not to rehash every scene but to point out that this Russian release is a fine crisp transfer that is (apparently) as good as its going to get. I don't know how the aspect ration compares to the original release but it wasn't at all distracting and is certainly better than the VHS.

545227,4,6302995876,"A 4 out of 5: ""My favourite action movie from 1964, by Director Philippe de Broca, this French-Italian movie classic, based on a Tintin adventure, The Broken Ear, turns spoof-farce-comedy, with kidnapping, theft from the Trocadero Museum, mysterious and dangerous thugs, a stolen flight to Rio, and echoes of Marcel Camus' superb 1959 all-time Brazilian classic, Orfeu Negro,with its favela backdrop, with Adrien, a superbly fit Jean-Paul Belmondo, in pugilistic mood often, chasing after his fianc, Agnes, a sultry and flirtatious Franoise Dorleac, down the Amazon - a twist at every bend in the river.  Also with Jean Servais, as the dodgy Professor Norbert Catalan and charming Adolfo Celi. Maybe also borrows some ideas from Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville and the Bogard vehicle, Treasure of Sierra Madre. Predates and presages Spielberg/Lucas' 1981 Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark and the more recent Laura Croft-series, without the supersonic bangs and techno gimmicks.""",1193616000,17,988,5.457516339869281
545228,4,6302995876,"Much has been written about Philippe de Broca's  L'homme de Rio . That Herg's  Tintin  albums inspired the film. That, when Spielberg wanted to adapt  Tintin  to the big screen, it was because of  L'Homme de Rio  in mind ; that, when he created Indiana Jones instead, he was again inspired by  L'Homme de Rio .

 L'Homme de Rio  is a blessed movie : the perfect blend of adventure and comedy ; so much chemistry between the two lead actors that it works even when the script tears them apart, i.e. during most of the film ; great pacing, only surpassed by nearly miraculous sense of timing.

Movie was released on 1963, therefore probably shot in 1962. Brazil still was a land of wonders on the other side of the world. The sights of Copacabana and Corcovado were not worn out postcards. Rio was no poster-city for drugs, violence and  favelas . Jean-Paul Belmondo could befriend a young boy without suspicions of pedophilia.

The great actor Jean-Paul Belmondo is in fine form, and the look of many scenes as well as many plot points can all be traced directly to Tintin albums.

The movie has the fun 1960's feel to it, with the 60's colors, musical soundtrack, etc. Don't let the fact that you have to sit through English subtitles put you off from enjoying this fun French film.

My only regret is that it is not out on DVD in the U.S. This gem of a film deserves Special Edition treatment, perhaps with extras tying it into to specific Tintin albums? Bring on a DVD release!",1152835200,15,693,4.492063492063492

7835939,5,6302995876,"1964's ""That Man From Rio"" is a very different, unusual and original spy film that does not borrow at all from the James Bond juvenile spy film franchise or any of its tiresome imitators, but is an intelligent, rated G, spies more along the lines of Indiana Jones adventure but seeming light years before Steven Spielberg was on the scene.  Using even slapstick, the film manages to be maniacally thrilling and exciting and the action is pandemonic and non-stop.  Starring Jean-Paul Belmondo and Francoise Dorleac (who had she not died at an early age, it would be inconceivable to imagine the delight of the French as she as equally and at times more talented comedically than her sister Catherine Deneuve has ever been seen to be) and together they are an unbeatable team to win your heart.  Dorleac was also extraordinary in 1964's ""Male Hunt"" directed by Eduoardo Molinaro.  The script is brilliant by J.P. Rappeneau, Ariane Mnouchkine, Daniel Boulanger and Phillippe de Broca and equally brilliantly directed by Phillipe de Broca.  De Broca and Belmondo teamed also for the swashbuckling ""Cartouche.""
