8442709,4,B004V2FV1Q,"Taqdeer is a rather enjoyable masala film. The film is partly a lost-and-found melodrama, partly a romance, partly an action flick, partly a social, and it is a hidden family treasure that carries the narrative forward. The story is very complicated and interesting, and the sequences involving the characters of Mithun Chakraborty and Zeenat Aman were particularly entertaining. The movie stars Shatrughan Sinha as Shiva, a young lonely man who lost his father and sister when he was a kid and no seeks revenge. Sinha is quite good in this role. Hema Malini plays his love interest. She is very graceful as the kind-hearted courtesan who was lost during a car accident in which her mother died and later found and adopted by a woman who is a brothel owner. Mithun Chakraborty is excellent as the silly and stylish rich guy who cares for nothing but enjoying life, drinking, chasing women and spending money. The one who steals the show is actually Zeenat Aman who delivers a wonderful comic performance as the sexy, sophisticated, carefree, yet kindhearted woman-thief. Some of her scenes are of the film's best and funniest and her chemistry with Chakraborty is great. Towards the end, Taqdeer starts losing its great spirit of joy and becomes very sentimental. I still liked the ending and the way the story was concluded. Taqdeer is not a great film, but it has its moments and it flows well with the nice songs and the unexpected proceedings. As a masala film of its sort, it is successful and enjoyable and deserves to be seen with the family.",1306281600,3,1549,4.827067669172933
