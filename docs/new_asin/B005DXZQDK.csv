8467751,5,B005DXZQDK,"This is a professionally made DVD from Fogerty's early comeback days.  It is a recording of a 2004 Austin City Limits performance despite what the cover photo may imply.  The video is 51 minutes long with 15 songs and no extra video material.  It is DVD quality and all the instruments and vocals stand out clearly.  The bass is a bit strong and has resonances around the low A that gets annoying after a while.  The later part of the show sounds a little better.  Fogerty plays several CCR songs and also several of his newer songs from prior to 2004 with a basic 4 piece band backing him on a simple stage with additional members joining in for the more modern songs.  The normal pauses and commercials between songs were edited out making the songs all sound rushed together.  Band member names are given at the end of the video but not on the cover of the DVD housing.  The overall volume was a little high.  Pans of the audience showed a lot of gray hair, a sign of his early comeback days.  Overall this was an enjoyable DVD of one of my favorite musicians.  I'm happy with my purchase and recommend this to any Fogerty fan.  You will play it more than once.",1395446400,4,1164,4.358139534883721
