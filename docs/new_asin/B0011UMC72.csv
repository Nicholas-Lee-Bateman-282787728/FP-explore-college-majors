3069460,5,B0011UMC72,"Big Love continues to be one of the best shows ever and centers on the  Hendrickson's, an American as apple pie family with a twist; they live a polygamous life style.  The three wives and all their assorted children live in side by side homes with connected backyards, all ""married"" to Bill a successful businesman.  We also spend time with the less monied, totally secluded compound dwellers led by Roman Grant the reigning prophet of the church (and also the father of Nikki, one of Bill's three wives.  Oh, did I tell you that Bill and Roman are arch enemies?). It's interesting to see the Hendricksons, the compound dwellers and mainstream Mormons all holding pieces of the truth and sharing a history yet are so different.  Or are they?

This show presents so many moral, ethical, religious and legal questions and it's quite entertaining as well as being thought provoking. Before this show, I thought all polygamists were Elizabeth Smart snatching sickos, 16 year old girls who are on their 4th child married to a 50 year old man with 10 other wives, or Warren Jeff power hungry nut jobs who destroy the lives of so many.

Yes, this show is a soap opera but it's so much more with well written dialogue and yes, humor.  We're not asked to live like the Hendrickson's but to try and understand their struggles to exist.",1258588800,2,1326,4.660944206008583
3069461,4,B0011UMC72,"These are outlaw Mormons in this series. I didn't realize this until I had seen enough episodes of BIG LOVE.  I erroneously thought that those Mormons living lawfully, one husband and wife only, are tolerant of polygamous Mormons. No, the lawful Mormons are the first to turn the outlaws in to the authorities and or to shun them upon discovery.  I also did not realize that the outlaw Mormons view their polygamous lifestyles as part of their religious hereafter planning.  They all plan on being reunited in the hereafter and being together in the large family they have built together.  That is why being fruitful and multiplying so many times is important.

I keep watching this show every season even though I find these characters infuriating.  Most infuriating is the effect this lifestyle has on their children.  It's not so bad when they are young but when they become teens, any decisions they want to make about their own futures and lifestyles are stomped on because they have to follow in these polygamous footsteps.  Talk about being in a straight jacket for life!

Salt Lake City businessman Bill Henrickson (Bill Paxton) is our polygamist in chief and he usually drives me absolute bats.  Servicing this guy, in any sense of the word, is a full time job for every other character.  One must be a huge egomaniac to occupy this position.  Anything less than having full egomania and you would be forced to find yourself insufferable. When I am about to hurl something through my tv screen at his his head, I do remember though that he was brought up on an outlaw Mormon compound with a guru head and totally insane parents.  Compared to them he is a model of decorum and the placid lifestyle. His entire business will collapse if he is discovered to be an outlaw polygamous Mormon.  No one who is not one of these will patronize his business. So everyone faces complete financial ruin on a daily basis too.

Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn) is his original wife.  This means all of her children are legitimate but she has two other houses attached to her house with two other wives and their children.  This is not what she signed on for and she has lost her entire family of mother, sister and sister's children as a result of her husband's outlaw election. Nicki (Chlo Sevigny), and Margene (Ginnifer Goodwin) are the other two wives.  Their children are illegitimate and can not be seen in public with their father as it would blow their cover.

In this third season, Bill, incredibly enough, starts dating a fourth woman whom he wants to make his fourth wife.  Bill doesn't believe in affairs or pre-marital sex.  No, it is marriage or nothing for him.  This fourth recruitment of a wife particularly infuriated me and I was grousing at the set, ""Why can't you go out and have an affair like a normal person?""

This ""moralist"" also is trying to get in on the casino gambling business and out of his other consumer products business. Reason?  No one in the gambling business cares how he leads his life and if they discover his lifestyle, nothing bad will happen financially.

This is another series, like WEEDS, which I would love to grade down.  However, if I have watched three full seasons, got so engrossed that I felt like throwing something through the tv set, then I suspect I must be enjoying it.  HBO has done it to me again, I'm afraid, hooked me in for the duration with these outlaw Mormons.

It was meant to be a birthday present, and now it's going to be a belated birthday present, and I am trying to figure out just how belated it will be.

3069463,5,B0011UMC72,"As some of the other reviewers mentioned, it was a long time coming for Season 3 to come out, but definitely worth the wait. I've been a loyal viewer of Big Love (it's one of my favorite HBO shows) since the beginning. The first one or two episodes of Season 3 may seem a bit trite (and boring) but that's because the writers are building up the story line. Hold on to your seats because after the first couple of episodes, you're going for a thrilling ride. As always, character development is superb as is the drama between the characters (inside and outside of the Hendrickson family). I won't go into the storyline, as I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but this is a definite must see.",1242604800,15,692,4.372093023255814
3069464,5,B0011UMC72,"I've been watching ""Big Love""from the start,and to be honest,I was getting bored untill the third season started,and everything happened.

3069465,5,B0011UMC72,"I have read on several Web sites that the ratings for this show are only so-so. It's a shame more people aren't watching it. This show has attracted the best character actors in Hollywood. And what a dream it must be to play characters that are so complex and multi-layered.

I will admit, the storylines are all very similar. They all revolve around either Bill having some issue with his wives or Bill struggling against people who are trying to keep him from the business deals he wants to make happen. (This season is focused on making Weber Gaming a success and all the trouble the getting into gambling is causing him and his family). The thing is, even though there is a predictable pattern of going back and forth between family drama and work drama, all the people in Bill's life continue to evolve and we continue to see them grow and struggle.

I truly hope this show is renewed for a few more seasons. I am still very invested in these characters and want to know what happens to them.",1240012800,43,997,4.472527472527473
3069466,5,B0011UMC72,Well I'm happy that Amazon has pre shipping!  Season three has been on ride that is worth watching again and again.  I can't wait for this to be a part of my collection.,1239667200,4,169,4.090909090909091
3069467,5,B0011UMC72,"For BIG LOVE fans like me, it was a loooooooong wait until a week ago when the first episode of Season 3 finally aired on HBO.  Luckily, I had taped Season 1 and 2 and was able to review the fun during the year lapse.

Now having already seen Season 3's 1st episode BLOCK PARTY a week ago and the 2nd episode EMPIRE yesterday, I am once again hooked for the remainder of the season!

To be honest, I had been a little concerned that the writers and actors were running short on creative ideas and that Season 3 might be a disappointing bore.  But, it hasn't been thus far, and I am excited as ever to see how the plots will unfold and where the imaginative writers and skillful cast will take us this season.

BTW, I am too busy (and lazy!) to arrange to tape the episodes this season, so I'm pre-ordering the Season 3 box set.  This series is definitely worth the 40 bucks to add it to my home DVD collection.

Enjoy!",1232928000,16,918,4.181818181818182

3069548,4,B0011UMC72,"Big Love took me a while to like.  I didn't have anything to connect to in real life, and the last two seasons reached a little to far with the public life of someone trying to live a private life being married to 3 women.  Season 3 was the highlight season where the story, character development, and realistic nature of problems I could see stemming from the situation matching something (I can only imagine) nearing realistic.  By this point you have your characters filed in terms of who you like, are for and against and can see the difficulties being faced by most all.  That is what made Season 3 the best as each characters challenges became realistic and clear and they brought them forward through dysfunction or resolution.  Overall a decent show, just a subject I couldn't really dig into that deep.  Though I think polygamy is wrong and dysfunctional I could start to see how the bigger family dynamics would develop in time and whether I agree or not it has been practiced for a long time and would definitely create unique challenges.  The show does a decent job of portraying them and I thought season 3 was the peak.",1463184000,,1133,4.579207920792079

3069579,1,B0011UMC72,"I have read many books on the subject of Polygamy and the Mormon religion.  Some books have been about the basic principles of the practice while others have detailed the courageous efforts of young women fighting to leave their abusive situations.  I was excited to see the series Big Love because of my interest in the subject matter.  Though I enjoyed the first season and was somewhat interested in the second, I found the third season to be tedious and silly.  For a polygamist family who continually spoke of fear that their lifestyle would be exposed, I'm surprised that they were continually blurting out their secret to anyone who would listen.  They told all of their neighbors, their families, their co-workers, their friends, their business partners, their potential fourth wife (okay, to be fair...I guess she had to know).  I wouldn't trust these people with any of my secrets!  And Bill just couldn't seem to keep himself out of trouble.  If you had a secret that could eventually get you arrested and destroy your family, wouldn't you lie low....Not Bill!  I got so tired of the endless drama that these people were constantly creating for themselves.  It was my mistake.  I should have reminded myself that this was not a documentary but a silly drama.  The actual principles of Mormonism seemed to have been discarded by this third season.  The show became just another silly ""soap opera.""  Oh, and the story line about Bill's parents...tedious and ridiculous and absolutely unbelievable.

BTW, I was surprised at how many sex scenes are in this series.  I know Mormons have sex, because that's how they get baby Mormons, but really do we have to see it?  I have to say that the character of Margene is the bright spot in the whole series.  I think Ms. Goodwin does a fantastic job acting the part.  I think Margene should kick the rest of the spouses to the curb.  Yee haw!",1454198400,,559,4.149532710280374

You have to be in touch with your feminine side to really appreciate the show because it is heavily about relationships, etc. This is not a pure slam on polygamy or morman religion. It is a slam on morman compounds which is not normal for morman people. There is some attempt to show the other side to polygamy.

Super bumbed out that this show got cancelled.

When I try to tell friends about the show, I get withering looks and marked disinterest because of the subject matter. What a shame.
People REFUSE to watch the show because they think ( no matter what you tell them ) that it promotes Mormonism and or polygamy.

IT DOESNT . The show illustrates the different stratas of polygamy, the people who are living ( and some escaping it ) and how it all works.

I've been an Athiest for 35 years, and I LOVE this show.

I really love the opening credits and song HOME which was introduced at the end of season 3 ( I think). My gosh, what a beautiful, instructive and wonderful illustration of what "" The Principle"" means to these people.

I rather hope Season 5 is better, but unfortunately I've read some spoiler (looked at IMDb when I shouldn't have) and I'm afraid I'm going to be disappointed in how it wraps up.

But 1 & 2 are very interesting, witnessing the day to day workings of such an unconventional family.

Season 3 starts going a little wonky. I found myself saying, ""Really?"" a lot. But Season 4 goes downhill for me. I find myself, rather than ""Really"", saying, ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?""",1405641600,,614,4.37719298245614

3070114,2,B0011UMC72,"This series is a humorous and serious look at the lives and stresses of modern polygamists, both those who live in enclaves and those trying to blend into society. I would rate the story highly but for a few really glaring problems. First, the series blurs the distinction between the mainstream LDS (Mormon) Church and the various offshoots which still practice polygamy. The series seems to mock the LDS Church by making its missionaries and members portrayed in the series seem either good-natured fools, or overbearing authoritarians, neither of which is the case. The series also takes inappropriate liberties with sacred LDS ordinances such as those occurring in the Mormon Temples by revealing them in minute detail unnecessary to the story line of the series, which could only be taken as a jab at the church and its members. Otherwise the series raises good questions about a life of polygamy in several different formats, and addresses some of those negative aspects of the polygamist enclaves.

Its too bad the writers obviously had an anti-LDS bias, and I am ashamed of Tom Hanks for sponsoring that kind of intolerance.",1404604800,,1132,5.0212765957446805
3070115,1,B0011UMC72,"I am fascinated that this incredibly boring, poorly acted show had five seasons on HBO...I noticed Tom Hanks is an Executive Producer...perhaps that explains it. Personally, I love HBO programming, even the stinky, guilty pleasures like True Blood...Big Love (or Big Snooze) is not provocative, interesting or entertaining. I am thankful it was free to Prime members, and honestly, I slept through great parts of it. Maybe I snoozed through all the good bits....I think polygamy is probably interesting to polygamist, dull to the rest of us sinners.",1404518400,,549,5.25
3070116,5,B0011UMC72,"at first i decided this was nothing but a glorified soap opera times three,but as the episodes developed and the characters blossomed i came to realize that under the guise of a tutorial about poligamy this series was actually a serious look at a man's spirituality and faith.the social dynamnics of a group family and its intergration in a larger nuclear society are carefully and realisticlly portrayed.the acting is generally outstanding,though at times the story lines can become somewhat tedious.all in all however this is an extremely well written and produced series that is thoughtful and intelligent while entertaining.",1404432000,,628,5.353535353535354

3070125,5,B0011UMC72,"My husband and I have been binge watching Big Love now for a few weeks, and I have finally bumped it up to five stars from four.  The first season was great, although it  just didn't quite make it to the level of 5 stars for me.  Might have just been that I was having trouble wrapping my head around the subject matter.  I had a certain culturally ingrained bias against polygamy and by extension, anyone who engages in that lifestyle.  Also - I was a little bit shocked by some of the sexual depictions.  I'm of a certain age and (my husband tells me) a little bit prudish.  The second season was still very engaging, but it felt less focused to me, as if the story lines were spinning out of control a little.  Still, having said all that - I was really looking forward to watching one or two episodes each night.

This third season, though, is the best of all so far.  The characters are even more sharply defined, and they are growing and deepening with every episode. The women are maturing and beginning to question the paternalistic hierarchy in their family and in their society at large.  They're stirring the waters, so husband Bill is having to re-examine some of his own beliefs, too. The stakes for each situation are so high that I long ago gave up trying to think of this as a ""slice of life"" drama. So instead I'm diving in to a ""willing suspension of disbelief"".  In other words - I've stopped comparing it to any reality that I have personally experienced or even witnessed.  I simply accept at face value that this family lives in a very different world than I do. But (and this is important) their relationships, their pain and their joy is completely familiar and rings very true.  And as I have said in my two previous reviews, watching this series has made me reconsider some of my own beliefs and prejudices while still keeping me engaged and entertained.  And I must mention -  there is humor here, too! -- woven into all the drama and heartache.

What more can you ask?",1403827200,,1996,4.43956043956044

3070140,4,B0011UMC72,"Binge watching may be inadvisable. I found myself wanting the Greene's to choke egomaniac, sex fiend, greedy, manipulative, not nearly as good looking as I thought he was in season 1, sanctimonious without accompanying religiosity Bill for at least another full minute, for Barb to wake up out of whatever fogs she's been in and finally inform her husband that she'll no longer tolerate his philandering ... regardless of his supposed testimony to go back to his fundamentalist roots, for Nicki to ""shut the H up"" with her whining, smirking, manipulative, destructive, falsely pious blather (actually, now that I think about it, she's Bill's female reflection) ... and for Margene to admit that she's bisexual, sexually attracted to Ben, and too naive to actually survive without at least three other people to care for her. I was very glad that Ana ran off.
On the other hand, I've obviously become so invested in the show that I'm writing a full length review.
Harry Dean Stanton is absolutely superb in his role as The Prophet; not only does he absolutely have that raw-boned appearance ... defines the concept, actually ... but voice inflection, facial expression, and entirety of presentation is award worthy (Hello, again, Kiser Pease. You ain't changed not one little bit in 40 long years. Where the Lilies Bloom made an indelible impression on me; this actor was a large part of that).
I'll be watching for other movies/shows that feature Matt Ross, who portrays Alby Grant; he has that charisma that makes him very interesting to watch
The other actors in Big Love play their roles to the hilt as well, as has been discussed by many other viewers.
While I know that there are many discrepancies between the actual lives of Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints members and this show, from my research ... inspired by the show, it seems that there are clear depictions of rituals, rites and attitudes of both the Fundamentalists and LDS. The show depicts an interesting glimpse behind the veil of the religions, while being entertaining.",1403222400,6,2066,4.956772334293948

It's typical liberal hype. Religion is insulted and represented by the fruitiest religious types.
Homosexuality and perversion comes in pretty quickly.
The ruse is to melt jelly brains into the Liberal Agenda mold.
The Executive Producer is a man who is married to another man! Not surprising.
Blatant confusion. If you think that there's nothing strange about that, well, you probably voted for the Muslim president who is crapping down the throat of America.
And if that image is disturbing then you might not appreciate Big Love either.

It was really in this season that the family's faith and each member's complex relationship to it was really explored, most notably in ""Come, Ye Saints"", an episode which remains a highlight of the series.",1358985600,,557,4.8125

DEFINITELY NOT a waste of your time. Just a JOY to watch! It continues to entertain. I have FORMER relatives (by marriage) who are Mormons and some of them are so... just off kilter...that, well, I could imagine some of them practicing polygamy. I am so glad they are FORMER relatives. Not realy very nice people. They were ALL hypocrites and used Mormonism only when it suited them.

BTW, I'm was born and bred in the Bible Belt but am agnostic. Just because you're raised in a certain religion does not mean you have to continue it's practice.

3070205,5,B0011UMC72,"When I first started watching the show, I found it to be a bit confusing.  There were so many characters and the concept seemed so far-fetched that I almost abandoned it after the first episode.  There were two reasons why I didn't.  One, it was produced by Tom Hanks.  Two, he stated very clearly in the first episode that somewhere between 20,000 to 40,000 people in the United States practiced polygamy.  Holy Mama!  I know there are also sects in Canada where I live, and the topic is certainly intriguing.  So I continued to watch and I'm so glad that I did.

Big Love traces the life of one man, Bill, who was kicked out of Juniper Creek, a polygamist cult, at a young age so that he did not serve as competition for the older men.  Bill proceeded to establish a fairly ""normal"" life for himself in the community with a wife and several children.  But then he was forced to take on another wife, and suddenly he found himself living a polygamist lifestyle outside of the compound, where it could present all kinds of complicated problems.  First, he and his family, who are trying to live by the ""principle,"" are forced into becoming constant liars.  Second, his wives live in the modern world and consequently, they talk back to him, unlike the more subservient women at the compound.  Third, his children are growing up in mainstream schools.  They have friends and they date.  They are torn about their feelings for their parents and the lifestyle.

This is a show that I think about after I flick off the TV, which is rare, because it poses so many interesting ethical issues.  How far should people be allowed to go to practice their religion when it conflicts with social norms and the law?  Does polygamy always exploit women, and child brides, or is there a downside for men too?

How long can people lie to others without feeling like hypocrites or have a knot inside their stomach like a cancer?  How many of us can relate in our own way in terms of being or doing something different -- many gays still need to hide their lifestyle.  Those who have affairs do the same.  How well do we know our neighbors?  These are great questions and if it sounds as though the show is just sociologically fascinating, it's not true.  It's got a lot of great laughs and terrific acting.  Fine entertainment.  I'm so happy I got past the first episode.",1272326400,3,2354,4.532066508313539

It is dense with ridiculous plots you won't care about, including bird smugglers in Mexico and the introduction of the normally brilliant Sissy Spacek playing a twisted harridan who seems to operate for no particular reason. More than ever, you will wonder why any women--much less three or four--would find anything to want or like in the boring, narcissistic, impotent Bill Henderson. Even Chloe Sevigny, who won a Golden Globe for playing one of the wives, called this season ""awful."" Look it up.

The show no longer relies on the taboos of polygamy (e.g. sex with a different woman every night), but really focuses on characters and the emotional complexity of the characters involved with such a marriage.  Season 3 also finds some pay offs for loyal viewers.  Certain storylines and hints that were placed as long ago as season 1 begin to reveal themselves.  The show also chooses to find a number of surprise character moves, and plot twists that really keep you glued to the television set. Beyond the rise in plot, the acting advanced as well.  While there was depth to the characters before, we get to see characters take on a number of different issues, including stories from the past, come to fruition, which the actors show in wonderful performances.

3070222,5,B0011UMC72,"My wife and I watched the complete Seasons One and Two of ""Big Love."" It was my wife's idea, and we enjoyed it very much. When Season 3 became available, we picked it up and we're now through with the last episode.

The first two seasons sort of acted as an introduction. It took a while to get used to plural marriage and all the interactions between the characters and the cultural setting involved. But the episodes seemed positive, almost bubbly, and it was interesting and amusing visiting the antics of this strangely constructed family and all the interacting people about them.

Season 3 took a turn toward the darker side. Everything seemed to start to fall apart and unravel in one way or another. The church, the family, the relatives, friends, the legal system and the business dealings all started to go wrong, sometimes very wrong. Everyone seemed to be unhappy for one reason or another. The teenage children started to have teenage problems. The wives started to have doubts, and one even started dating. A failed attempt was made to add another wife to the group. The relatives went through endless bickering. The church and the legal system became ominous. Now, don't think I'm complaining! I'd say, and my wife agrees, the third season was much more interesting than the first two. This plural marriage and strangely mixed family actually became much more real. The acting was excellent. The Utah setting was wonderful. The problems were heartfelt. Many of the problems seemed much like those of conventional families, but magnified in scope because of the complexity of the mixture. One episode had the entire family going on a journey to their religious roots in a several-thousand-miles auto trip in three cars, no less. It was hilariously funny, but quite touching.

We would judge Season 3 to be much better than the previous 2, and we hope this series keeps going. My wife and I enjoyed it as a type of story at first, and a peek at a strange other world, but it gradually turned into a dark comedy and there was not a night when we didn't get some good laughs. Does everyone react that way? We doubt it. I suppose everyone interprets it in their own way. However, ""Big Love"" presents compelling viewing.

The cast is as superb as ever, and somehow you can't help but feel for these troubled, loving family members even though they are living in an arrangement that most of us would never imagine or want.",1263859200,,578,4.78
3070242,5,B0011UMC72,"I've been a long-time fan of Big Love, and can't help but be addicted to this story about a polygamist, successful Mormon businessman Bill Henrickson (played credibly by Bill Paxton), and his three wives - Barb (Jeanne Triplehorn) the first wife who was initially (during her battle with cancer)persuaded by husband Bill to embrace ""The Principle"" which basically embraces the concept of polygamy. Through Seasons 1-2, we see Barb struggle with the consequences of living The Principle as reflected in the conflicts between her and her two other sister wives (as the co-wives are called) and also the impact it has on her own relationship not just with Bill and their children, but also Barb's family. Then there's second wife Nicolette (Chloe Sevigny) who is the daughter of Roman Grant, the patriarch and Prophet of Juniper Creek, a Mormon settlement and whose followers all embrace The Principle. Nicki's character is often portrayed as ultra religious and rather extreme in her views, though she is not without flaws - for one, she is a spendthrift and her battles with shopping addiction was well-chronicled in the earlier seasons. The main reason for Nicki's joining Bill's family was initially to provide a mother figure for Bill and Barb's children in case Barb should die. Finally, the third wife is Margene, the new convert to The Principle, and also the youngest amongst the wives. Over the seasons, we see Margene maturing into her role as the third sister wife and no longer as naive as she was in the first season.

As Season Three begins, there is plenty of drama to keep long-time fans entertained and to intrigue new fans (though this series does need to be watched from the First Season in order to truly understand all the dynamics of the relationships and the convoluted story arcs). In the first half of this season, the two main story arcs are the trial of Roman Grant as well as Ana (the prospective fourth sister wife). Ana (played by Branka Katic) is a Serbian waitress (with a credible accent to boot) who is being wooed by Bill. Ana is attractive but far from submissive, demonstrating an independent and inquiring mind, and more importantly a strong will that may prove incompatible with Bill and his three wives. So the wives get to know Ana, a collective undertaking initiated by Barb. This first half of the season also sees Bill trying his hardest to get his casino business off the ground. The rest of the third season sees the repercussions of this relationship between Bill and Ana, as well as what happens as a result of Roman's trial. Bill and his family face some serious issues - those of faith, problems faced by Bill's offspring especially daughter Sarah (the brilliant Amanda Seyfried, recently seen in ""Jennifer's Body""), and other shenanigans within the family.

The various story arcs are well-plotted, and the ensemble cast does a credible job in making these characters seem like very real people facing life problems - only thing is, the problems are not always the conventional sort which is to be expected given the premise of the series which deals with the issues of plural marriage. The ending of Season 3 was quite satisfactory for me - there's enough left unresolved that I look forward to Season 4 (which is premiering soon on HBO), but there's also enough resolution for some story arcs that one is not left completely hanging.

DVD features - well, the aspect ratio is 16:9, there is the option of Spanish, French, English subtitles (and also English closed captioning). There is a total of 10 episodes on 4 discs (each in its own plastic case, the slim version). The picture and audio quality are above average in my opinion, very clear audio and crisp and well-defined picture. The extras are found on Disc 1 - the usual trailer for HBO programming, ""Their Stories So Far"" where Bill and the three sister wives speak to the camera, addressing who they are etc, ""Three Past Midnight"" which consist of 3 enactments involving the main characters. Final verdict - a highly entertaining, original, and engrossing show - a must-have for fans!",1262995200,10,4096,4.856938483547926

3303957,5,B0011UMC72,"Big Love continues to be one of the best shows ever and centers on the  Hendrickson's, an American as apple pie family with a twist; they live a polygamous life style.  The three wives and all their assorted children live in side by side homes with connected backyards, all ""married"" to Bill a successful businesman.  We also spend time with the less monied, totally secluded compound dwellers led by Roman Grant the reigning prophet of the church (and also the father of Nikki, one of Bill's three wives.  Oh, did I tell you that Bill and Roman are arch enemies?). It's interesting to see the Hendricksons, the compound dwellers and mainstream Mormons all holding pieces of the truth and sharing a history yet are so different.  Or are they?

This show presents so many moral, ethical, religious and legal questions and it's quite entertaining as well as being thought provoking. Before this show, I thought all polygamists were Elizabeth Smart snatching sickos, 16 year old girls who are on their 4th child married to a 50 year old man with 10 other wives, or Warren Jeff power hungry nut jobs who destroy the lives of so many.

Yes, this show is a soap opera but it's so much more with well written dialogue and yes, humor.  We're not asked to live like the Hendrickson's but to try and understand their struggles to exist.",1258588800,2,1326,4.660944206008583
3303958,4,B0011UMC72,"These are outlaw Mormons in this series. I didn't realize this until I had seen enough episodes of BIG LOVE.  I erroneously thought that those Mormons living lawfully, one husband and wife only, are tolerant of polygamous Mormons. No, the lawful Mormons are the first to turn the outlaws in to the authorities and or to shun them upon discovery.  I also did not realize that the outlaw Mormons view their polygamous lifestyles as part of their religious hereafter planning.  They all plan on being reunited in the hereafter and being together in the large family they have built together.  That is why being fruitful and multiplying so many times is important.

I keep watching this show every season even though I find these characters infuriating.  Most infuriating is the effect this lifestyle has on their children.  It's not so bad when they are young but when they become teens, any decisions they want to make about their own futures and lifestyles are stomped on because they have to follow in these polygamous footsteps.  Talk about being in a straight jacket for life!

Salt Lake City businessman Bill Henrickson (Bill Paxton) is our polygamist in chief and he usually drives me absolute bats.  Servicing this guy, in any sense of the word, is a full time job for every other character.  One must be a huge egomaniac to occupy this position.  Anything less than having full egomania and you would be forced to find yourself insufferable. When I am about to hurl something through my tv screen at his his head, I do remember though that he was brought up on an outlaw Mormon compound with a guru head and totally insane parents.  Compared to them he is a model of decorum and the placid lifestyle. His entire business will collapse if he is discovered to be an outlaw polygamous Mormon.  No one who is not one of these will patronize his business. So everyone faces complete financial ruin on a daily basis too.

Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn) is his original wife.  This means all of her children are legitimate but she has two other houses attached to her house with two other wives and their children.  This is not what she signed on for and she has lost her entire family of mother, sister and sister's children as a result of her husband's outlaw election. Nicki (Chlo Sevigny), and Margene (Ginnifer Goodwin) are the other two wives.  Their children are illegitimate and can not be seen in public with their father as it would blow their cover.

In this third season, Bill, incredibly enough, starts dating a fourth woman whom he wants to make his fourth wife.  Bill doesn't believe in affairs or pre-marital sex.  No, it is marriage or nothing for him.  This fourth recruitment of a wife particularly infuriated me and I was grousing at the set, ""Why can't you go out and have an affair like a normal person?""

This ""moralist"" also is trying to get in on the casino gambling business and out of his other consumer products business. Reason?  No one in the gambling business cares how he leads his life and if they discover his lifestyle, nothing bad will happen financially.

This is another series, like WEEDS, which I would love to grade down.  However, if I have watched three full seasons, got so engrossed that I felt like throwing something through the tv set, then I suspect I must be enjoying it.  HBO has done it to me again, I'm afraid, hooked me in for the duration with these outlaw Mormons.

I will admit, the storylines are all very similar. They all revolve around either Bill having some issue with his wives or Bill struggling against people who are trying to keep him from the business deals he wants to make happen. (This season is focused on making Weber Gaming a success and all the trouble the getting into gambling is causing him and his family). The thing is, even though there is a predictable pattern of going back and forth between family drama and work drama, all the people in Bill's life continue to evolve and we continue to see them grow and struggle.

I truly hope this show is renewed for a few more seasons. I am still very invested in these characters and want to know what happens to them.",1240012800,43,997,4.472527472527473
3303963,5,B0011UMC72,Well I'm happy that Amazon has pre shipping!  Season three has been on ride that is worth watching again and again.  I can't wait for this to be a part of my collection.,1239667200,4,169,4.090909090909091
3303964,5,B0011UMC72,"For BIG LOVE fans like me, it was a loooooooong wait until a week ago when the first episode of Season 3 finally aired on HBO.  Luckily, I had taped Season 1 and 2 and was able to review the fun during the year lapse.

Now having already seen Season 3's 1st episode BLOCK PARTY a week ago and the 2nd episode EMPIRE yesterday, I am once again hooked for the remainder of the season!

To be honest, I had been a little concerned that the writers and actors were running short on creative ideas and that Season 3 might be a disappointing bore.  But, it hasn't been thus far, and I am excited as ever to see how the plots will unfold and where the imaginative writers and skillful cast will take us this season.

BTW, I am too busy (and lazy!) to arrange to tape the episodes this season, so I'm pre-ordering the Season 3 box set.  This series is definitely worth the 40 bucks to add it to my home DVD collection.

Enjoy!",1232928000,16,918,4.181818181818182

3304045,4,B0011UMC72,"Big Love took me a while to like.  I didn't have anything to connect to in real life, and the last two seasons reached a little to far with the public life of someone trying to live a private life being married to 3 women.  Season 3 was the highlight season where the story, character development, and realistic nature of problems I could see stemming from the situation matching something (I can only imagine) nearing realistic.  By this point you have your characters filed in terms of who you like, are for and against and can see the difficulties being faced by most all.  That is what made Season 3 the best as each characters challenges became realistic and clear and they brought them forward through dysfunction or resolution.  Overall a decent show, just a subject I couldn't really dig into that deep.  Though I think polygamy is wrong and dysfunctional I could start to see how the bigger family dynamics would develop in time and whether I agree or not it has been practiced for a long time and would definitely create unique challenges.  The show does a decent job of portraying them and I thought season 3 was the peak.",1463184000,,1133,4.579207920792079

3304076,1,B0011UMC72,"I have read many books on the subject of Polygamy and the Mormon religion.  Some books have been about the basic principles of the practice while others have detailed the courageous efforts of young women fighting to leave their abusive situations.  I was excited to see the series Big Love because of my interest in the subject matter.  Though I enjoyed the first season and was somewhat interested in the second, I found the third season to be tedious and silly.  For a polygamist family who continually spoke of fear that their lifestyle would be exposed, I'm surprised that they were continually blurting out their secret to anyone who would listen.  They told all of their neighbors, their families, their co-workers, their friends, their business partners, their potential fourth wife (okay, to be fair...I guess she had to know).  I wouldn't trust these people with any of my secrets!  And Bill just couldn't seem to keep himself out of trouble.  If you had a secret that could eventually get you arrested and destroy your family, wouldn't you lie low....Not Bill!  I got so tired of the endless drama that these people were constantly creating for themselves.  It was my mistake.  I should have reminded myself that this was not a documentary but a silly drama.  The actual principles of Mormonism seemed to have been discarded by this third season.  The show became just another silly ""soap opera.""  Oh, and the story line about Bill's parents...tedious and ridiculous and absolutely unbelievable.  It was the main reason I stopped watching the series mid season.",1457308800,4,1572,4.9465648854961835

BTW, I was surprised at how many sex scenes are in this series.  I know Mormons have sex, because that's how they get baby Mormons, but really do we have to see it?  I have to say that the character of Margene is the bright spot in the whole series.  I think Ms. Goodwin does a fantastic job acting the part.

You have to be in touch with your feminine side to really appreciate the show because it is heavily about relationships, etc. This is not a pure slam on polygamy or morman religion. It is a slam on morman compounds which is not normal for morman people. There is some attempt to show the other side to polygamy.

Super bumbed out that this show got cancelled.

When I try to tell friends about the show, I get withering looks and marked disinterest because of the subject matter. What a shame.
People REFUSE to watch the show because they think ( no matter what you tell them ) that it promotes Mormonism and or polygamy.

IT DOESNT . The show illustrates the different stratas of polygamy, the people who are living ( and some escaping it ) and how it all works.

I've been an Athiest for 35 years, and I LOVE this show.

I really love the opening credits and song HOME which was introduced at the end of season 3 ( I think). My gosh, what a beautiful, instructive and wonderful illustration of what "" The Principle"" means to these people.

The issues investigated are not profound, since they occur within the context of a 'faith' religion - but intriguing nonetheless.

3304590,3,B0011UMC72,"I'm halfway through Season 4, and I think Seasons 1 & 2 are my favorite. Season 3 gets a little, ""Wait. What, now?"" and Season 4 is pretty off the rails. I rather hope Season 5 is better, but unfortunately I've read some spoiler (looked at IMDb when I shouldn't have) and I'm afraid I'm going to be disappointed in how it wraps up.

But 1 & 2 are very interesting, witnessing the day to day workings of such an unconventional family.

Season 3 starts going a little wonky. I found myself saying, ""Really?"" a lot. But Season 4 goes downhill for me. I find myself, rather than ""Really"", saying, ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?""",1405641600,,614,4.37719298245614

3304611,2,B0011UMC72,"This series is a humorous and serious look at the lives and stresses of modern polygamists, both those who live in enclaves and those trying to blend into society. I would rate the story highly but for a few really glaring problems. First, the series blurs the distinction between the mainstream LDS (Mormon) Church and the various offshoots which still practice polygamy. The series seems to mock the LDS Church by making its missionaries and members portrayed in the series seem either good-natured fools, or overbearing authoritarians, neither of which is the case. The series also takes inappropriate liberties with sacred LDS ordinances such as those occurring in the Mormon Temples by revealing them in minute detail unnecessary to the story line of the series, which could only be taken as a jab at the church and its members. Otherwise the series raises good questions about a life of polygamy in several different formats, and addresses some of those negative aspects of the polygamist enclaves.

Its too bad the writers obviously had an anti-LDS bias, and I am ashamed of Tom Hanks for sponsoring that kind of intolerance.",1404604800,,1132,5.0212765957446805
3304612,1,B0011UMC72,"I am fascinated that this incredibly boring, poorly acted show had five seasons on HBO...I noticed Tom Hanks is an Executive Producer...perhaps that explains it. Personally, I love HBO programming, even the stinky, guilty pleasures like True Blood...Big Love (or Big Snooze) is not provocative, interesting or entertaining. I am thankful it was free to Prime members, and honestly, I slept through great parts of it. Maybe I snoozed through all the good bits....I think polygamy is probably interesting to polygamist, dull to the rest of us sinners.",1404518400,,549,5.25
3304613,5,B0011UMC72,"at first i decided this was nothing but a glorified soap opera times three,but as the episodes developed and the characters blossomed i came to realize that under the guise of a tutorial about poligamy this series was actually a serious look at a man's spirituality and faith.the social dynamnics of a group family and its intergration in a larger nuclear society are carefully and realisticlly portrayed.the acting is generally outstanding,though at times the story lines can become somewhat tedious.all in all however this is an extremely well written and produced series that is thoughtful and intelligent while entertaining.",1404432000,,628,5.353535353535354

3304622,5,B0011UMC72,"My husband and I have been binge watching Big Love now for a few weeks, and I have finally bumped it up to five stars from four.  The first season was great, although it  just didn't quite make it to the level of 5 stars for me.  Might have just been that I was having trouble wrapping my head around the subject matter.  I had a certain culturally ingrained bias against polygamy and by extension, anyone who engages in that lifestyle.  Also - I was a little bit shocked by some of the sexual depictions.  I'm of a certain age and (my husband tells me) a little bit prudish.  The second season was still very engaging, but it felt less focused to me, as if the story lines were spinning out of control a little.  Still, having said all that - I was really looking forward to watching one or two episodes each night.

This third season, though, is the best of all so far.  The characters are even more sharply defined, and they are growing and deepening with every episode. The women are maturing and beginning to question the paternalistic hierarchy in their family and in their society at large.  They're stirring the waters, so husband Bill is having to re-examine some of his own beliefs, too. The stakes for each situation are so high that I long ago gave up trying to think of this as a ""slice of life"" drama. So instead I'm diving in to a ""willing suspension of disbelief"".  In other words - I've stopped comparing it to any reality that I have personally experienced or even witnessed.  I simply accept at face value that this family lives in a very different world than I do. But (and this is important) their relationships, their pain and their joy is completely familiar and rings very true.  And as I have said in my two previous reviews, watching this series has made me reconsider some of my own beliefs and prejudices while still keeping me engaged and entertained.  And I must mention -  there is humor here, too! -- woven into all the drama and heartache.

What more can you ask?",1403827200,,1996,4.43956043956044

3304637,4,B0011UMC72,"Binge watching may be inadvisable. I found myself wanting the Greene's to choke egomaniac, sex fiend, greedy, manipulative, not nearly as good looking as I thought he was in season 1, sanctimonious without accompanying religiosity Bill for at least another full minute, for Barb to wake up out of whatever fogs she's been in and finally inform her husband that she'll no longer tolerate his philandering ... regardless of his supposed testimony to go back to his fundamentalist roots, for Nicki to ""shut the H up"" with her whining, smirking, manipulative, destructive, falsely pious blather (actually, now that I think about it, she's Bill's female reflection) ... and for Margene to admit that she's bisexual, sexually attracted to Ben, and too naive to actually survive without at least three other people to care for her. I was very glad that Ana ran off.
On the other hand, I've obviously become so invested in the show that I'm writing a full length review.
Harry Dean Stanton is absolutely superb in his role as The Prophet; not only does he absolutely have that raw-boned appearance ... defines the concept, actually ... but voice inflection, facial expression, and entirety of presentation is award worthy (Hello, again, Kiser Pease. You ain't changed not one little bit in 40 long years. Where the Lilies Bloom made an indelible impression on me; this actor was a large part of that).
I'll be watching for other movies/shows that feature Matt Ross, who portrays Alby Grant; he has that charisma that makes him very interesting to watch
The other actors in Big Love play their roles to the hilt as well, as has been discussed by many other viewers.
While I know that there are many discrepancies between the actual lives of Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints members and this show, from my research ... inspired by the show, it seems that there are clear depictions of rituals, rites and attitudes of both the Fundamentalists and LDS. The show depicts an interesting glimpse behind the veil of the religions, while being entertaining.",1403222400,6,2066,4.956772334293948

It's typical liberal hype. Religion is insulted and represented by the fruitiest religious types.
Homosexuality and perversion comes in pretty quickly.
The ruse is to melt jelly brains into the Liberal Agenda mold.
The Executive Producer is a man who is married to another man! Not surprising.
Blatant confusion. If you think that there's nothing strange about that, well, you probably voted for the Muslim president who is crapping down the throat of America.
And if that image is disturbing then you might not appreciate Big Love either.

3304702,5,B0011UMC72,"When I first started watching the show, I found it to be a bit confusing.  There were so many characters and the concept seemed so far-fetched that I almost abandoned it after the first episode.  There were two reasons why I didn't.  One, it was produced by Tom Hanks.  Two, he stated very clearly in the first episode that somewhere between 20,000 to 40,000 people in the United States practiced polygamy.  Holy Mama!  I know there are also sects in Canada where I live, and the topic is certainly intriguing.  So I continued to watch and I'm so glad that I did.

Big Love traces the life of one man, Bill, who was kicked out of Juniper Creek, a polygamist cult, at a young age so that he did not serve as competition for the older men.  Bill proceeded to establish a fairly ""normal"" life for himself in the community with a wife and several children.  But then he was forced to take on another wife, and suddenly he found himself living a polygamist lifestyle outside of the compound, where it could present all kinds of complicated problems.  First, he and his family, who are trying to live by the ""principle,"" are forced into becoming constant liars.  Second, his wives live in the modern world and consequently, they talk back to him, unlike the more subservient women at the compound.  Third, his children are growing up in mainstream schools.  They have friends and they date.  They are torn about their feelings for their parents and the lifestyle.

This is a show that I think about after I flick off the TV, which is rare, because it poses so many interesting ethical issues.  How far should people be allowed to go to practice their religion when it conflicts with social norms and the law?  Does polygamy always exploit women, and child brides, or is there a downside for men too?

How long can people lie to others without feeling like hypocrites or have a knot inside their stomach like a cancer?  How many of us can relate in our own way in terms of being or doing something different -- many gays still need to hide their lifestyle.  Those who have affairs do the same.  How well do we know our neighbors?  These are great questions and if it sounds as though the show is just sociologically fascinating, it's not true.  It's got a lot of great laughs and terrific acting.  Fine entertainment.  I'm so happy I got past the first episode.",1272326400,3,2354,4.532066508313539
3304713,1,B0011UMC72,"If you ever liked Big Love, you will hate Season 4. It is dense with ridiculous plots you won't care about, including bird smugglers in Mexico and the introduction of the normally brilliant Sissy Spacek playing a twisted harridan who seems to operate for no particular reason. More than ever, you will wonder why any women--much less three or four--would find anything to want or like in the boring, narcissistic, impotent Bill Henderson. Even Chloe Sevigny, who won a Golden Globe for playing one of the wives, called this season ""awful."" Look it up. Just type in Season 4 and the word ""awful"" and you will find that Season 4 was a disaster.

3304717,5,B0011UMC72,"Big Love's move into the third season gave us a show tht was clearly turning into something better.  The show no longer relies on the taboos of polygamy (e.g. sex with a different woman every night), but really focuses on characters and the emotional complexity of the characters involved with such a marriage.  Season 3 also finds some pay offs for loyal viewers.  Certain storylines and hints that were placed as long ago as season 1 begin to reveal themselves.  The show also chooses to find a number of surprise character moves, and plot twists that really keep you glued to the television set. Beyond the rise in plot, the acting advanced as well.  While there was depth to the characters before, we get to see characters take on a number of different issues, including stories from the past, come to fruition, which the actors show in wonderful performances.

Needless to say this was an impressive season.  I hope this trend of the show growing evolving continues with the fourth season.  Highly recomended.",1266278400,,1014,4.820809248554913

3304719,5,B0011UMC72,"My wife and I watched the complete Seasons One and Two of ""Big Love."" It was my wife's idea, and we enjoyed it very much. When Season 3 became available, we picked it up and we're now through with the last episode.

The first two seasons sort of acted as an introduction. It took a while to get used to plural marriage and all the interactions between the characters and the cultural setting involved. But the episodes seemed positive, almost bubbly, and it was interesting and amusing visiting the antics of this strangely constructed family and all the interacting people about them.

Season 3 took a turn toward the darker side. Everything seemed to start to fall apart and unravel in one way or another. The church, the family, the relatives, friends, the legal system and the business dealings all started to go wrong, sometimes very wrong. Everyone seemed to be unhappy for one reason or another. The teenage children started to have teenage problems. The wives started to have doubts, and one even started dating. A failed attempt was made to add another wife to the group. The relatives went through endless bickering. The church and the legal system became ominous. Now, don't think I'm complaining! I'd say, and my wife agrees, the third season was much more interesting than the first two. This plural marriage and strangely mixed family actually became much more real. The acting was excellent. The Utah setting was wonderful. The problems were heartfelt. Many of the problems seemed much like those of conventional families, but magnified in scope because of the complexity of the mixture. One episode had the entire family going on a journey to their religious roots in a several-thousand-miles auto trip in three cars, no less. It was hilariously funny, but quite touching.

We would judge Season 3 to be much better than the previous 2, and we hope this series keeps going. My wife and I enjoyed it as a type of story at first, and a peek at a strange other world, but it gradually turned into a dark comedy and there was not a night when we didn't get some good laughs. Does everyone react that way? We doubt it. I suppose everyone interprets it in their own way. However, ""Big Love"" presents compelling viewing.

It was shipped all 3 boxed sets together, the only issue I have is that some of the edges of the boxes were a little bent or crushed but its not a huge deal.

The cast is as superb as ever, and somehow you can't help but feel for these troubled, loving family members even though they are living in an arrangement that most of us would never imagine or want.",1263859200,,578,4.78
3304739,5,B0011UMC72,"I've been a long-time fan of Big Love, and can't help but be addicted to this story about a polygamist, successful Mormon businessman Bill Henrickson (played credibly by Bill Paxton), and his three wives - Barb (Jeanne Triplehorn) the first wife who was initially (during her battle with cancer)persuaded by husband Bill to embrace ""The Principle"" which basically embraces the concept of polygamy. Through Seasons 1-2, we see Barb struggle with the consequences of living The Principle as reflected in the conflicts between her and her two other sister wives (as the co-wives are called) and also the impact it has on her own relationship not just with Bill and their children, but also Barb's family. Then there's second wife Nicolette (Chloe Sevigny) who is the daughter of Roman Grant, the patriarch and Prophet of Juniper Creek, a Mormon settlement and whose followers all embrace The Principle. Nicki's character is often portrayed as ultra religious and rather extreme in her views, though she is not without flaws - for one, she is a spendthrift and her battles with shopping addiction was well-chronicled in the earlier seasons. The main reason for Nicki's joining Bill's family was initially to provide a mother figure for Bill and Barb's children in case Barb should die. Finally, the third wife is Margene, the new convert to The Principle, and also the youngest amongst the wives. Over the seasons, we see Margene maturing into her role as the third sister wife and no longer as naive as she was in the first season.

As Season Three begins, there is plenty of drama to keep long-time fans entertained and to intrigue new fans (though this series does need to be watched from the First Season in order to truly understand all the dynamics of the relationships and the convoluted story arcs). In the first half of this season, the two main story arcs are the trial of Roman Grant as well as Ana (the prospective fourth sister wife). Ana (played by Branka Katic) is a Serbian waitress (with a credible accent to boot) who is being wooed by Bill. Ana is attractive but far from submissive, demonstrating an independent and inquiring mind, and more importantly a strong will that may prove incompatible with Bill and his three wives. So the wives get to know Ana, a collective undertaking initiated by Barb. This first half of the season also sees Bill trying his hardest to get his casino business off the ground. The rest of the third season sees the repercussions of this relationship between Bill and Ana, as well as what happens as a result of Roman's trial. Bill and his family face some serious issues - those of faith, problems faced by Bill's offspring especially daughter Sarah (the brilliant Amanda Seyfried, recently seen in ""Jennifer's Body""), and other shenanigans within the family.

The various story arcs are well-plotted, and the ensemble cast does a credible job in making these characters seem like very real people facing life problems - only thing is, the problems are not always the conventional sort which is to be expected given the premise of the series which deals with the issues of plural marriage. The ending of Season 3 was quite satisfactory for me - there's enough left unresolved that I look forward to Season 4 (which is premiering soon on HBO), but there's also enough resolution for some story arcs that one is not left completely hanging.

DVD features - well, the aspect ratio is 16:9, there is the option of Spanish, French, English subtitles (and also English closed captioning). There is a total of 10 episodes on 4 discs (each in its own plastic case, the slim version). The picture and audio quality are above average in my opinion, very clear audio and crisp and well-defined picture. The extras are found on Disc 1 - the usual trailer for HBO programming, ""Their Stories So Far"" where Bill and the three sister wives speak to the camera, addressing who they are etc, ""Three Past Midnight"" which consist of 3 enactments involving the main characters. Final verdict - a highly entertaining, original, and engrossing show - a must-have for fans!",1262995200,10,4096,4.856938483547926

Many of the numerous issues which have been circling during the last two seasons have finally come to a head rocking the very bedrock of not only the entire Hendrickson family but the LDS community as well.  Families are splitting apart and a dear one dies due to the continued aggressive attempts by Roman to control everyone around him. Many roles shift, new businesses are launched, and the future of the Hendrickson family remains unclear as members spin off in different directions. Surprises abound as everything that was becomes something else. Once again close attention must be paid to keep up with all the change.
