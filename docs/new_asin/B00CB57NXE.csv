8579570,5,B00CB57NXE,"I have been practicing Takenouchi-Hangan-Ryu-Matsuno-Crandall for over two years now and this DVD and the accompanying book have been a vital resource to my training. The book and DVD cover a wide variety of aspects of the style including katas, uniforms, sword care, history of the style, batto-do forms, and more. The book provides excellent detail on all topics covered and the DVD provides fantastic visuals to go along with the book. The pair complements the training a student of the style will receive very well.",1441756800,,519,5.046511627906977
8579571,5,B00CB57NXE,"The Takenouchi-Hangan-Ryu-Matsuno-Crandall Iaido Style and Batto-do Instructional DVD is a prominent part my Martial Arts library.
I am a beginner student of the style and find it to be an invaluable resource that I turn to regularly, especially soon after learning new Katas and techniques.  As a visual learner, it has been extremely helpful in assisting me to ""cement"" new information into long term memory. It allows me to fully experience the grace, beauty and peace that I get while training, and immediately review what I have learned in the privacy of my home.
 It is in no way meant to be a substitute for training under the guidance of Headmaster Crandall.
  This DVD, combined with the Takenouchi- Hangan -Ryu- Matsuno -Crandall Iaido Style and Batto-do textbook are a very important part of my training regimen.",1440115200,2,823,5.029411764705882
8579572,5,B00CB57NXE,"The Takenouchi-Hangan-Ryu-Matsuno-Crandall Instructional DVD is an excellent supplemental resource to the Takenouchi-Hangan-Ryu-Matsuno-Crandall Instructional Workbook, and a great addition to any martial artists personal library. As a student in Takenouchi-Hangan-Ryu-Matsuno-Crandall, I have used this DVD to review katas prior to class, confirm corrections received during class, and to better understand the history, philosophy, and fundamentals of the style. Headmaster Crandall has documented the forms taught in the style with multiple views for reference purposes (they are not taught in this DVD, but reviewed at the pace they should be done for resource purposes). Additionally covered in this 2-disc DVD are fundamentals such as: stances, stretching, bowing in and out of class, the uniform, and etiquette, as well as batto-do katas and cutting. This would make good reference material for anyone training in a sword style, or anyone bearing an interest in the sword. I highly recommend this DVD as a martial arts resource.",1439424000,2,1034,5.809210526315789
8579573,5,B00CB57NXE,"As a new student of Takenouchi-Hangan-Ryu-Matsuno-Crandall Iaido Style I find this DVD set to be an essential resource to use as an adjunct to the class.  The video tutorials presented in the set include a wide variety of topics that helped bring me up to speed quickly when initially joining the school.  Topics such as necessary equipment, uniforms, customs, stretching, and sword care were all outlined in detail.  Headmaster Crandall and Renshi Morris also provide excellent documentation of every Kata from beginner to headmaster so that they can be reviewed outside of class.  This is especially useful for students of any level when they are working on a new Kata and trying to perfect every detail.  Headmaster Crandall specifically mentions toward the beginning of this video series that the DVD set is not intended to teach you this style of Iaido.  Instead it is meant to be used as a reference for a student of the style, and I completely agree with him.  It is not possible to learn this art from a book or video alone.  You must have a highly experienced mentor guiding you and pointing out your mistakes in order to truly master any aspect of this style.",1438214400,4,1169,4.781094527363184
8579574,1,B00CB57NXE,"This DVD is based on the false information of a fraudulent Japanese teacher, namely Matsuno Tsuneyoshi. Matsuno Tsuneyoshi was NOT appointed to teach Takenouchi Hangan ry after the passing of Nakajima Masayoshi sensei. This DVD shows the techniques of a fraudulent school founded by Matsuno Tsuneyoshi just 30 years ago. It is NOT Takenouchi Hangan ryu which will be celebrating its 300th anniversary next year.

A quick bio of Matsuno Tsuneyoshi (Born 1933 died 2005)

Matsuno Tsuneyoshi was an accomplished movie actor and sword fight choreographer from Kawanishi-shi in Hygo prefecture Japan.

Matsuno began his martial arts career in high school where he studied kend, jd, karated, jdo, iaid, aikijjutsu, before entering the entertainment industry as a background chanbara actor.

While acting in the entertainment industry he furthered his studies of martial arts for acting adding tessenjutsu, juttejutsu, sjutsu, and naginatajutsu. Based on his experience in the arts he learned in high school, he founded a martial arts movie fighting group. He was a member of the All Japan Kend Federation

Matsuno began practice of Enshin ry under Nichikan Kobayashi the 10th headmaster of Enshin ry (Kobayashi-kei) in 1974. He left the Kobayashi-kei after just four months (Nichikan Kobayashi died in 1975).

He became a student of Takeuchi Hangan ry under the 4th headmaster Nakajima Masayoshi sensei in 1978.

After a falling out with Nakajima Masayoshi sensei and the Australian shibucho Robert Smith sensei in 1983 over a book he had written entitled Bugei Ju-Happan, Matsuno was ejected from the Takenouchi Hangan ry with the grade of 2nd dan.

The Takenouchi Hangan ry Matsuno ha (Matsuno branch) was invented by Matsuno Tsuneyoshi from his limited experience in Takenouchi Hangan ry and his previous experience in iaid/chanbara. At best he was a chanbara sword fight instructor as is evidenced by the movie-like posturing and ""techniques"" displayed in this book. He attempted to start a school in Perth, Western Australia convincing John Napier-Winch sensei that he was teaching Takenouchi Hangan ry and then later claiming he had inherited some scrolls of the Shind ry from his grandfather in a dream! According to Nakajima Shigeru sensei, Matsuno borrowed the ""shin"" character from the Enshin ry, to show his inspiration, despite barely studying the school.

The Takenouchi Hangan ry is headed by Nakajima Shigeru in saka Japan (currently not teaching). The only authorised instructor of Takenouchi Hangan ry kogusoku koshi no mawari outside of Japan is James Kemlo sensei, a direct student of Robert Smith sensei and Nakajima Masayoshi sensei. The school is NOT an iaid school. The iaid techniques shown in this DVD are NOT Takenouchi Hangan ryu.

The correct history of the Takenouchi Hangan ry:

The school has no connection with Minamoto no Yoshitsune at all other than this name and cannot ""be traced back to him"" as is misrepresented by Matsuno Tsuneyoshi.

Takenouchi Hangan ry (also Takenouchi Hgan ry) is a branch of Takenouchi ry, a martial school which was founded in 1532 by Takenouchi Hisamori.

It became a branch school named Takenouchi Hgan ry in 1715 when Tokugawa Tsugutomo Owari-chnagon (6th head of the Owari Tokugawa household, ruled 1713 - 1730) witnessed a demonstration of Takenouchi ry by samurai Nishikawa Kyusaburo Ryuchosai from Amagasaki castle. Tsugutomo was attending the castle during the celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the death of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first shgun of the Tokugawa period (1600-1868).

Ryuchosai was a master swordsman of the middle samurai rank in the service of Matsudaira Tadataka Ttmi no Kami, the Daimy (lord) of Amagasaki castle. Ryuchosai held the rank of inkajo (authority to pass on the teachings) in Takenouchi ry from Takenouchi Kaganosuke Hisayoshi, the 3rd headmaster of Takenouchi ry.

So impressed by the martial prowess of Ryuchosai, Tokugawa Tsugutomo gave Ryuchosai permission to use the term ""Hgan,"" () thus creating a branch school with the name Takenouchi Hgan ry under the tutelage of Ryuchosai. Tokugawa Tsugutomo chose the name ""Hgan"" after one of Japan's most famous samurai generals Kur Hgan Minamoto no Yoshitsune (1159 - 1189), from whom the Tokugawa family claimed descent, thus cementing the Takenouchi Hgan ry as an Owari Tokugawa school.

Ryuchosai was also awarded an increase in his yearly stipend, from 300 to 600 koku (one koku = one bushel of rice), a considerable doubling of his base income.

Takenouchi Hgan ry is historically tied to Amagasaki castle and the Owari branch of the Tokugawa family and has long been taught in the Kansai region. Among the 18 martial teachings of Takenouchi Hgan ry are heigaku (martial strategies) as established by Tokugawa Yoshimichi (4th head of the Owari Tokugawa household, ruled 1699 - 1713) and later written down by Chikamatsu Hikonoshin Shigenori a famed strategist who founded Ichizen ry.

The modern pronunciation of the school name is Takenouchi Hangan ry, historical texts however refer to the school as Takenouchi Hgan ry. When used in people's names it is common to say Hangan, so it isn't entirely incorrect. As a martial school name though it is historically read as Hgan. The term Hgan was used in the twelfth century to refer to lieutenancy in the kebiishi Ch - the Kyto Police. The title was bestowed upon Minamoto no Yoshitsune by retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa in 1184. Undoubtably this promotion was the cause of the rift between Yoshitsune and his brother, Yoritomo. Hgan was often later used as a variant name for Yoshistune, thus the naming of the school after Minamoto no Yoshitsune.

Yes, even Japanese create fake schools.",1413849600,3,5683,5.211622807017544
