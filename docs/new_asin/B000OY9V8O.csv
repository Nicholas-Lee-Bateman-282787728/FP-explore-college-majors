2803263,5,B000OY9V8O,.... but then I'm a huge Harvey Keitel fan!  This was one of the better ones in my opinion.,1222128000,2,91,3.789473684210526
2803264,1,B000OY9V8O,"This should have and could have been a 90 minute thriller. Instead we have 139 minutes of convoluted nonsense.
  Bad editing all around.
  A plot that cries for more viable dialogue.
  Characters that yearn and require deeper understanding.
  Erratic cinematography.
  At the end of it you kind of know what happened but you don't really care.
  That's the responsibility of the director. To make his audience relate and involve their emotions. It never happens.
  A truly great cast headed by the wonderful Harvey Keitel who can't save this one.
  Even the credits are bizarre.
  A waste of time.",1188345600,9,597,4.918367346938775
2803265,5,B000OY9V8O,"Great, elegant crime thriller set in Sicilian Islands. Harvey Keitel rules as a New York cop sent to Itally and trying NOT to fall under the spell of  the corrupt life there.",1187568000,5,174,4.4375

8187387,4,B000OY9V8O,"This is a film I recommend to my friends. A bit too long, and the plot slows down too much, but Harvey Keitel  carries the story very well. Especially of interest to those who like European cinema.",1416009600,,197,4.324324324324325
8187388,3,B000OY9V8O,"This was a boring movie.  About an FBI agent looking into a murder.  He travels with his family(stupid move) putting them in danger as well as the boy, whose father is murdered, he is trying to get info from.
The boy is first seen almost naked near a public bath or swimming pool.  He is beautiful and is a bright spot in an otherwise bland movie.
I wouldn't buy this film again, although it does have its moments",1411430400,,413,4.269230769230769
8187389,3,B000OY9V8O,"Ginostra (2002) is a  European movie based on the town of the same
name (Ginostra) on the Island of Stromboli, off the coast of
Sicily. The summary promises an underworld drama, with big-name
actors, here, Harvey Keitel (playing a FBI agent related to the
Witness Protection Program) and Andie MacDowell (the agent's wife.)

This work has it's pro's and con's, with each depending largely on
the viewers' personalities, such as the extent to which one is a fan
of those actors or not, or is a fan of underground police dramas,
 of European cinema, etc.

At the same time, some observations are agreed upon by the majority
of viewers, the first and foremost  being the unnecessarily long,
marathon-like  135 mins duration, that came about first, by a total
lack of editing effort by director Manuel Pradal, ( allowing many
rambling and  repetitive sequences - the volcano eruptions, lava
flows, the ocean scenes off the coast of Palermo, Ginostra or
Napoli) and secondly, by an obvious onanistic, artistic control by
the same director, impervious to outside opinion or commentary as
to what is or isn't redundant in the final cut (such as the included
unexplained across-the-room zoom shots of MacDowell's naked boobs
at one point, observed by an Italian peace officer.)

Secondly, the movie script seems transposed or inspired  from a
book, and at times jumps sequences from one place to another, such
as gun play in and out of a moving street car, creating non-sequiturs.

There is also an excessive and incomprehensible effort in making the
grade school age child a protagonist, at the expense of the 2
stars already mentioned, in addition to  Harry Dean Stanton (a warm
presence) and  Francesca Neri (to some, a  Cameron Diaz lookalike.)

Considering that the work appears to have been financed largely by
the local government for promotion of Italian culture, the majority
of the actors are local Italians, and as such, even the protagonists
more often than not, struggle in speaking their lines in English.

Conversely, the positive aspects are many, ranging from the relaxed
pace of the story, the beauty of the sequences in Ginsotra and
ocean front, the tension and danger relayed at various moments,
the surprising/ brutal moments that unfold unpredictably, the
classical music soundtrack that underlines an emotional depth felt
by the characters. The filming that was done in snow, rain,  cold  and
volcanic conditions demonstrate a remarkable effort by the crew and
production. Both HK and AM demonstrate their extraordinary presence,
and charisma, although diametrically different, masculine vs. feminine,
tough-guy vs.delicate and well mannered. respectively,

Here, the script touches  only very superficially on the underground
and peace officers. At no point, is there any dialog between underground
leaders or their captors. Much of the story concerns the psychological
effects on family members of the Camorra or 'Ndrangheta's presence at large
and again superficially, the efforts to track down their individual members,
by SWAT-like teams, dropped by helicopters into villages for arrests.

Overall, this is an introverted story, that underlines the fear and
varied emotions  that regular folks experience when caught in something
beyond their control.",1362355200,3,3271,5.276061776061776
8187390,2,B000OY9V8O,"The story was potentially interesting but boy was it confusing, strange at times and too often very slow. The nuns ending up being a bunch of hit ladies was about the last nail in the coffin for this one, and then it wound up with a live pet lamb that had a bomb planted inside it.  Too strange for sure. I am surprised I sat through all of this film. I kept thinking things might start to make sense and by the end some of it did, but the strange nonsense that occurred within it and some of the confusing characters never did.",1361836800,2,528,4.12621359223301
8187391,2,B000OY9V8O,"2 Stars for a Good Cast
0 Stars for a really bad story
I don't want to give anything away for those planning to watch it, but this film has great cinematography, a great cast and a crappy story. I walked away thinking Volcano Cult and Exploding Animals????? You watch it to figure out what I mean. This film has a train wreck of a story. Luckily it was a free watch on Prime otherwise I would want my money back.",1361404800,4,412,4.098765432098766
8187392,5,B000OY9V8O,"Whilst the general public panned this movie as trash...it is inescapably one of the best acted roles for Harvey Keitel.
Non verbal communication is an art that only a few actors can aspire to.
The engagement between Harvey and the boy that embraced fear..conflict...mistrust and hope was largely a masterpiece in non verbal acting. Despite the somewhat confusing editing.....the close ups of eye to eye contact between the two main stars is an achievement in excellence.",1355529600,2,470,5.197368421052632
8187393,4,B000OY9V8O,I like this film as the characters performed very well and the scenes progressed with no flashbacks. I really don't care for dark scenes with very little light as details are not clear and you have to use your imagination as to exactly actors are doing. It is worth buying from Amazon.,1347062400,,285,4.5
8187394,1,B000OY9V8O,"I bought this movie thinking it'd be a good watch. I'm a big fan of the mafia movie genre and I love Harvey Keitel. But this movie was just plain boring, and far too long. But don't think I'm the kind of person who can't appreciate a slow moving film (I loved The Killing of a Chinese Bookie). Plus there was just some rediculous moments, like the nuns pushing the car off the cliff even though he was sitting right in it and in park....

You want a good Harvey Keitel flick, go check out Reservoir Dogs or Mean Streets. You're looking for slightly obscure gangster movies try Wannabes, Revolver, Family Enforcer or Ghost Dog.",1276992000,3,626,4.443478260869565
8187395,5,B000OY9V8O,I have ordered product's from amazon on quite a few occasions and have yet to be disapointed. ( Thank You ).,1266624000,,108,4.190476190476191
