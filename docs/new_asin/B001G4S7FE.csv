The techniques in this Kung Fu video are similar to sword fighting and include wielding the cane single handed and double handed in both trusting and swinging movements. There is also a counter grappling movement which maneuvers the cane out of the grasp of an opponent.

Video Sequence:
1. Warm up / Longevity exercises.
2. Sword form viewed from front, back and side.
3. Self defense, each move demonstrated against a large person attacking.

Warm up exercises consist of slow stretching of the legs and torso, range of motion by reaching in various directions and circling the arms and shoulders. The longevity aspects of this are obvious. As we grow older our joints and muscles stiffen up without regular exercise. This stiffening up may lead to injuries. Also regular movement and exercise improve both the circulator and respiratory system which carry fresh nutrients and oxygen to the body and brain. Every medical doctor agrees that regular exercise improves both the physical and mental health. In medical terms it is called psycho soma (mind body) response. It is a two way interdependent support mechanism. A healthy body promotes a healthy brain. A healthy brain is more intellectual and promotes smoother problem solving and less stress. This leads to maintaining a healthier body.

Sword form is a linear form which progresses forward with blocking and striking  movements then turns around 180 and works its way back to the starting point. There are about 8 or so sword moves repeated throughout the form in various combinations. There are also some side steps to avoid the full momentum of the opponent. The form is demonstrated 3 times. First with a front view, second following from the back and third from the side. I found this very easy to follow along with.

Self defense moves are demonstrated one at a time. A very large attacker moves in with an attack and Grand Master Chen counters with a specific cane defense movement. It is very easy to understand and looks very effective.",1286582400,3,2107,4.940677966101695
