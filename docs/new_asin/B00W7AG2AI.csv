7125579,2,B00W7AG2AI,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When the press release for a film touts it as CABIN IN THE WOODS and BLAIR WITCH PROJECT meet JACKASS, theres no way Im going to pass up the opportunity to watch it.  Im a big fan of CABIN and BLAIR WITCH, and I confess Im a sucker for the JACKASS antics, so my interest is doubly piqued by a description like that.  THE JOKESTERS press release made such a claim, so I decided to give it a look last night.  Unfortunately, the film itself is nowhere near as awesome as the description.  The result is a lackluster horror flick that falls flat on its face.

I am not going to label THE JOKESTERS as the worst film Ive seen so far this year, however its pretty close.  It is a movie filled with promise, yet lacking on almost every level.

THE JOKESTERS is shot in a first-person POV, as are most found footage films, and the camerawork is nothing extraordinary.  The production value appears decent, but otherwise it looks like every other lower budget movie.  There are literally no attributes that pull this one up from the rest.

The acting is bland and lifeless.  The four main characters are annoying more than anything, and I could not find any reason to care about them at all.  The pranks they pull are ho-hum and boring, which completely destroys the credibility of their successful web show.  I was hoping for craziness and off-the-wallinstead, we get one of the guys glued to his go-cart seat.  WOW.

The story in THE JOKESTERS has promise, but it never develops in the film.  The first hour of the movie is all set-up (the wedding scenes take WAY too much time), so by the time the horror starts, the viewer is ready to fall asleep.  I literally had to pause the film and stand up for a moment to keep from nodding off.  Once the killings start, the film gets a little better, however this only occurs in the last 15-20 minutesthus, its too little, too late.

I wish I had better things to say about THE JOKESTERS.  It has an interesting premise and could be a fun film, if it were made by the right people.  Sadly, this version is not.  I cannot recommend this one with a good conscious, but the film is available now in a variety of formats if you decide to check it out.",1438128000,7,2257,4.359712230215828
7125580,2,B00W7AG2AI,"Four buddies who are pranksters, film their pranks and put them on U-Tube. When Ethan (Dante Spencer) gets married his buddies show up with their cameras and pranks. The pranks don't stop and continue into the honeymoon in the cabin in the woods. Then things turn bad.

The film had its funny parts, but overall the low budget hand held camera gave us black scenes and no movement scenes with only sound. The film was light on plot and horror.

7125581,1,B00W7AG2AI,"So apparently, these guys have been watching WAY too much ""The Impractical Jokesters"".  I hate that show too and I should have taken that as a hint, but noooooo, I'm a sucker for a ""found footage"" movie and I must watch them.  My other problem is, I refuse to turn a movie off once I start it.

This movie revolves around Nick and his three best friends.  They are a group known as ""The Prankmasters"" with a YouTube channel and a huge following.  One of the members, Ethan, is getting married.  After the ceremony, he and his new bride, Gabrielle make the trip into the woods to stay at Nick's Uncle's Cabin.  Nick convinces the other two members of the crew to tag along and play a ""prank"" by filming the newlyweds and faking an ""ax murder"" scenario.  It backfires, Ethan beats the crap out of Nick and he runs off to the car to whine.  Next morning it's revealed that the other two members had let Ethan and Gabrielle in on the joke prior to their trip to the cabin with Nick.  After being ""pranked"" in return, Nick turns homicidal, and kills everyone.

There,....I just saved you money and better yet, TIME!  The acting is beyond terrible!  The story is even worse.  It takes 55 minutes before ANYTHING happens, and even then nothing is even remotely interesting/entertaining.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one!

Final Verdict:  PASS!",1437696000,6,1342,4.548117154811716
7125582,4,B00W7AG2AI,"In the sea of ""found footage"" films that have swept the cinema since ""Blair Witch"", it is nice to finally see a movie do something different with the genre and make you realistically believe why someone would be running around with a camera 24/7.
""The Jokesters"" is a breath of fresh air in a stale genre. A simple premise, that you know will go so horribly wrong, captures you from the start with likable characters and a great sense of humor. Nick, Andrew, Chris, and Ethan are a group called ""PrankMasters"" a successful internet show, think less offensive than the ""Jackass"" boys, who are losing one of their own to the institution of marriage. Nick (played with abundant glee by Nathan Reid) comes up with the idea to have one last prank on Ethan (Dante Spencer) when he marries the beautiful Gabrielle (Jen Yeager).
The thing that works best about the film is the comraderie among the main characters. The chemistry between the PrankMasters is excellent. These are guys who love hanging out with each other and you can believe the anxiety that they would feel as things change beyond their control. I can't lie these are guys I would want to hang out with, believable and likable guys that clearly know how to have fun.
It's hard to say too much with out giving away things but as things progress and start to take the inevitable dark turn, that's when ""The Jokesters"" kicks into high gear.
So kick back relax and enjoy the ride.",1437696000,3,1434,4.627450980392157
7125583,5,B00W7AG2AI,"Very strong performances across the board.  I can't give too much away here but Nathan Reid shines.  Reid is perfected twisted and found all sorts of interesting layers in his character.  The film moves quickly with laughs, blood and scares in all the right places.  I could see them making a sequel to this and has the potential to be a fun, dark and twisted franchise.",1437091200,2,370,4.5606060606060606
7125584,1,B00W7AG2AI,"In THE JOKESTERS, a group of guys called the Prankmasters (famous on YouTube for their prank videos) decide to throw one last big prank on a member of their crew who is getting married. The synopsis (written by the screenwriter/lead actor, Nathan Reid) calls it a ""Cabin in the Woods"" prank that goes ""so well that it actually becomes The Cabin in the Woods horror in real life.""

If you're a first-time filmmaker, it's generally wise to avoid mentioning in your script or promotional materials other, far superior films. It invites comparisons that are rarely flattering.

This very short film (it's barely 80 minutes long) spends the bulk of its time following the Prankmasters (why is the film called THE JOKESTERS and not THE PRANKMASTERS?) as they do pranks, ruin Ethan's wedding, and generally treat each other like crap. You have Ethan (the hot one who's getting married), Chris (the one who sometimes speaks in Spanish), and Andrew (the one who is not the other two). The fourth member of their crew, Nick, is by far the most obnoxious. Scriptwriter Nathan Reid plays him with an unrelenting juvenile abandon that quickly annoys everyone around him. That includes me.

For a movie that classifies itself as found footage horror, there is very little of that promised terror. It takes 55 minutes for anything remotely interesting to happen, during which we are treated to a series of pranks that include things like ripping off a girl's top and then running away, locking the car when someone gets out to pee by the side of the road, and putting a two-day-old jockstrap on a friend's face. (I'm surprised no one gets a phallus drawn on their forehead.) This hour is clearly meant to provide us with character development, but the script obviously doesn't know what constitutes ""development."" There are a few plot points dropped here and there, but mostly the story just spins its wheels. There's a hint at a gay subplot that could've made the movie a little more unique if not interesting, but this is quickly abandoned.

The final twenty minutes of the movie are a hasty, scattershot mess with two very heavily foreshadowed twists. Perhaps hoping to make up for the glacial pace of the previous hour, the last act of the film is unnecessarily rushed (especially considering that the movie doesn't even have the run time of what most would consider a feature film). Although we are treated to some decent effects and shots (for an indie), they are cobbled together with so little awareness of pacing that they play like a highlight reel, like the editor got tired of trying to tell a story and just slapped together all the creepiest scenes that they filmed without adding any of the connective tissue that would make it interesting or coherent.

There's a clear stab at a possible sequel, including a segment where a news reporter (a friend of the bride from the aforementioned wedding) learns on-air about the Cabin in the Woods horror that (possibly?) claimed the lives of her friends. (I'm pretty sure television reporters preview the stories they're going to read and don't just wing it live.) The same reporter also -- in one of the laziest tropes a screenwriter can employ -- delivers a big chunk of parting exposition (the kind of stuff that should've been salted into the first hour of the movie) to justify the choppy mess you just watched.

If the last quarter of the film had been stretched out to form the bulk of the film, and if the twists and turns had been more skillfully employed, and if the character development had been actual development, even if the pranks had been more creative or the jokes less childish, this might have been worth the viewing. As it is, the only thing genre fans might get a kick out of is the fairly liberal T&A (and that includes of the male variety, in case you're into that sort of thing).",1437091200,17,3845,4.748502994011976

This movie was ok,if you like foundfootage you could do worse(or better),but I think its worth a watch. The 2nd half got my attention,the 1st half full of pranks by the prankmasters was a little juvie ,but when things got serious my interest picked up. I can understand the harsh reviews,we all can't like the same movies,I just LOVE foundfootage and I gave it 3 stars because it was ok..thats it..it was ok.",1438992000,2,569,4.533980582524272
7125591,5,B00W7AG2AI,"This movie was so much fun! The banter among the guys was very amusing and the pranks were entertaining to watch. If they had a real show my husband and I would absolutely watch it.

It hovered right between tense and comical for most of the movie and then the horror kicked in and it actually made sense why it went over the edge. Messing with someone's worst phobia is seriously asking for trouble!

All the characters were easy to get to know and like and there was never a dull moment.

Very entertaining! Highly recommend. :)",1438905600,2,530,4.443298969072165
7125592,5,B00W7AG2AI,"The Jokesters takes a premise and runs with it in a unique way. Rather than set up a hack and slash movie that leaves more questions than it answers, the minds behind the Jokesters choose to build characters, drama and give us ANSWERS to questions we might not even know to ask.
It is a solid start to what I hope is a franchise, as it is a fresh and inviting movie. Loved the cast and the crew did really well, too!
I found myself laughing, as well as drawn into the deeper story.
Thoroughly enjoyable--a different kind of movie than I expected. A thought-provoking multi-genre movie that has plenty of chills to satisfy the horror  fan, laughs for the comedy fan and drama for those thriller fans.
Also, the soundtrack is amazing.",1438819200,3,732,4.503759398496241

When one of their number is set to get married and quit the show, his friends aim to pull off one last prank to end them all. But then things go very, very wrong.
Ok, it's found footage and the pacing is a little off, but there's plenty to admire here.
With it's cool and unique premise, engaging, well-written characters and some technically superb filmmaking, this is a film that feels fresh in a genre in serious danger of stagnating. It's clever, unpredictable and well worth your time.",1438214400,3,672,4.56198347107438
7125596,1,B00W7AG2AI,"First - don't let the references to Cabin in the Woods lure you in - this trainwreck has NOTHING to do with anything related to that awesome movie. No monsters, nothing supernatural. The only thing they have in common is... a cabin. So, if you;re a CITW fan, don;t let them sucker you into thinking this has anything remotely like CITW in it. This, sadly, is just a terrible microbudget c-movie that tried to latch on to the success of CITW to attract renters/buyers.

An incredibly great premise that lured me in... then dropped the ball with mediocre acting, and a stunningly predictable, BORING c-horror movie. Wow, I can't un-recommend this strongly enough, especially given the package it was wrapped in - like getting a sweater from your grandmother at Christmas. You love the wrapping, and you're hoping for the best... but, no, you get a sweater. A really lame, JC Penny, polyester sweater.

You know, they might have pulled this off, had Nathan Reid (Nick) had more range and depth and talent, and pulled off the psychopath role - he might have been abe to salvage this video. But, instead, we're just left with a movie in which you see every ""twist"" coming so far off that they hardly qualify as twists - especially the ending.

The best part of this movie is the plot summary. Don't fall for it, though.",1438128000,5,1314,4.655172413793103

8712384,2,B00W7AG2AI,I really wanted to watch this movie because the cover looked awesome. I'm a Horror fan in general. But this movie sucked. Sorry but it took 40 minutes just to get through the wedding scenes. I thought this was a slasher movie. Yes a few people die. But not in tell later in the film after the wedding bores you out of your mind. The acting is terrible. The only actor worth a darn was Gabriel Tigerman. Not his best role though. I remember him from Supernatural. Anyways don't waste your time on this movie. It was nothing like what I thought it would be. I'm glad I only gave $1.79 plus shipping for it.

8712388,1,B00W7AG2AI,"15 minutes into this thing and I switched it off from being annoyed at this movie taking too long to get on with it. 15 minutes of idiots playing jokes on each other that I guess might be funny if you where one of the people involved, but for an audience watching them? It is not funny one bit or slightly entertaining.
For a horror flick, nothing is worse than delaying the meaning of why people watch a horror/thriller, and when it's a bunch of morons laughing about doing stupid things and prepping for a wedding, it's already killed my interest in caring what eventually might be coming later. Pranksters who are not funny, characters that are irritating, and no sign of anything entertaining coming soon.
I just don't care. I'm not a fan of hand held films at all, and I hate a majority of them, but at least I can say many other types of these films at least have pacing and try to do something where I can watch more than 15 minutes of it to get a feel if it's worthy of watching once or not?.
Where as this one is zzzzzz here and zzzzzzzz there.

Don't bother with this, or at least skip the first 20 minutes and see if some kind of movie started developing after that? I can vouch that the first 15 minutes are an utter waste of time. No horror, no comedy, no entertainment, no interested.
If I wouldn't bother watching someones wedding day video on Youtube, why would I wanna see someones in a movie? I'm glad I did not pay anything to see what I did, but the film makers and cast should pay ME for the 15 minutes of my life wasted of utter boredom.",1442448000,,1559,4.249158249158249
