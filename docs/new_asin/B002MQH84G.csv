8374008,5,B002MQH84G,"Our school has the kids crochet in 2GRD, even the boys.  It's so good for their fine motor and writing skills.  However, it's hard for a parent who doesn't already crochet ( or is just short on time and patience) to make the lessons happen.  This video is perfect.  I your child can operate the navigation himself, you don't need to do anything.  Just hand him a ball of yarn and a hook.  He can repeat the instructions over and over.  Thankfully, it's a little boy talking.  So many of the kid books for this skill are covered in girl pictures.  My first boy wouldn't care, but the second one wouldn't touch anything girly.",1402012800,7,624,4.4035087719298245
8374009,5,B002MQH84G,"This may be 4 kids, but this was one of two DVDs that I just bought (as an ADULT first-timer) to see if I could learn the basics of crochet.  It was colorful, fun, and an excellent way to learn the basic stitches.  One of the things I had problems with learning from books, was knowing exactly WHICH stitch to crochet into when 'turning around' on a new row.  In this DVD, there is a very clear animation of... 'not THIS stitch... but THIS stitch"".. marked with an animated star and an arrow pointing to the exact stitch. The DVD has several sections.  You learn the basic stitches from animated ""alpacas', and then from a young boy (Ryan). There is a section where Ryan teaches some friends to crochet a simple decorative flower, and the animated alpacas teach you how to make a triangular 'scarf' (like a cowboy's bandana).  Then (and this was my favorite - since it's what I really wanted to know), there is a VERY long and detailed (some would say tedious, but as a beginner, I disagree) step-by-step tutorial on making a multi-colored granny square .. and how to attach granny squares together to make an afghan or blanket!  For me, this alone was worth the price of admission!
  I liked this DVD so much that I ordered the version for Knitting  (even though I know the basics of knitting...just to see how they did with the presentation).  This was SOO much better than all the basic books I've spent money on trying to learn the basics.  Highly Recommended!!!",1390003200,17,1466,4.5361216730038025
8374010,5,B002MQH84G,this product helps me with my pre-teen crocheting class that I offer at the library I attend.  The students learn so easily the things that they were finding difficulty with.,1388188800,3,174,4.8
8374011,5,B002MQH84G,I purchased Art of Crochet : 4  Kids for my grand-daughter to learn crochet because I can't be there to teach her personally. She loves it because the lessons are given by children. She has learned a lot from this kid friendly video.,1377561600,8,233,4.4186046511627906
8374012,4,B002MQH84G,Good video help for kids learning to crochet.  I highly recommend the llamas--how to make the stitches is shown very clearly and eliminates the problem of whether to sit in front of the learner or off to the side.  I couldn't give it 5 stars because my granddaughters had a problem with a boy showing them how to crochet!,1375228800,3,321,4.423728813559322
8374013,5,B002MQH84G,"Now here's a DVD that will perform as advertised - Entertain, Educate and Inspire young people through crochet. There are three different ways to learn how to Crochet on this DVD. The first is with an animated yodeling Alpaca and his crocheting sister ( they're really funny!)  the second is with a 9 year old crochet whiz kid Ryan Anderson -- kids learning from  their peers is a great way to go. And the last is a lesson in how to  make granny squares from Instructor Marcy Hamilton, a happy cute woman who's surrounded by animated animals.

This is instructional DVD at it's highest quality. Your child will learn to crochet from this DVD in a matter of hours. You will pick up a trick or two as well from this easy, easy instruction. The projects ( Wild West Scarf and Granny squares) will provide hours of fun for kids, will increase their math and motor skills and give them a great sense of achievement, having made something really useful.

I totally recommend this DVD, you can't go wrong. Totally fabulous entertainment and instruction.",1275350400,22,1046,4.663043478260869
