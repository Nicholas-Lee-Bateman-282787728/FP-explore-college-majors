2005493,5,B0001IN0C6,"The set of Flex Appeal: A Belly Dance Workout is stunningly exotic. Curtains are draped from the ceiling and extend luxuriously until they gently kiss the wooden floor or pillows set against the walls. The lighting is especially beautiful and rose petals are artistically scattered across the floor at the edges of the Persian carpets. The room is open and there are windows, which gives the room a sense of freedom many sets don't provide. The walls are the color of desert sand and one of the windows is draped in golden fabric and it is drenched in sunlight.

Kathy's costumes are beyond beautiful. All the dancers wear unique and stunning jewel-tone costumes (complete with reflective detailing and delicate fringes) as they sway to music and tone their stomachs to perfection. There are calming transitions so you never feel left behind. I could actually keep up with the dancing because it is in smaller segments and the transitions allow you to slow down and then get back into the routine. This is much more about learning the belly-dance moves and much less about creating a routine. Although, there is a dance you could learn and the Solo Dance by Ansuya also gives you an idea of how the dance looks when compared to a dance-themed workout.

You may find you will start to release various negative emotions trapped in your body. Not only will you feel a release of stress, upon the completion of this workout, you will also notice amazing toning in your stomach, the lubrication of joints and how relaxed and sensual you will feel. Of course, a few hours later, you can tell this works because you will fall into bed and wish someone would give you a massage. This workout definitely works muscles other exercise routines don't touch.

A fringed scarf will help you experience the sensuality of belly dancing. You don't need to wear shoes and you can be barefoot while burning calories as you practice snake arms, rib lifts, shoulder shimmy's and hip movements that look deceptively easy. They get easier after a few weeks. Kathy focuses on precision and then ups the tempo, so you have time to learn a move before she speeds up each motion ""to tempo."" I think this is intermediate when the moves speed up and yet it can be used as an introduction to belly dance because of the slower speed while memorizing the mesmerizing motions. This workout is now one of my favorite Belly Dance workouts because the set is exotic and Kathy Smith really seems to be enjoying her sexy side. If you are bored with regular routines and want to try dance, then try this workout for a more sensuous experience.

2005494,5,B0001IN0C6,"Kathy Smith did it again- and this time with more emphasis on the presentation than ever before! Her belly dancing workout is great to watch and the beautiful setting puts you in the right mood. The music is great and the moves have a lot of variety. Having taken various dance classes, including belly dancing, for several years,this tape didn't offer a lot of new challange for me. However, it still offered a great dance class and because the moves were not too difficult (but not too easy either), you really get to move your hips and get into it and enjoy! It gives you a nice exercise too, in muscles you hardly knew you had!

For beginner belly dancers, the instruction given is very good and detailed, plus there is a separate instruction 'chapter' for all the trickiest moves.

I highly recommend this tape for everyone looking for a fun dance workout!",1092182400,9,861,4.620915032679738
2005495,5,B0001IN0C6,I really like Kathy Smith's new bellydance workout.  I can feel it working every single muscle in my body.  I also like how all of the women are in costume.  I think it puts one more in the mood.  She goes slow enough in the Slow and Sensual section the I learned the moves more easily than I did in Veena and Neena's bellydancing for beginners series.  The Heat It Up is a good aerobic workout that gets your heart pumping.  Plus you don't have to take the time to wear shoes since it is very low impact.  I don't feel any more feminine or sensual doing the workout or afterwords.  It's exercise.  But the moves have a calming effect of putting my crying baby to sleep when he doesn't want to be rocked.  That I guess could be feminine.,1092009600,5,737,4.2
2005496,4,B0001IN0C6,"This workout video is very well-put together and really gets you dancing and sweating. Kathy Smith doesn't try to do this ancient dance all on her own but actually employees real belly dancers in the video, one even shows you a three minute dance that you can try to follow along to. My only gripe is that sometimes she doesn't give you quite enough time to get use to the moves but that is something that goes away after you do the tapes a few times. Of course, I could just be especially uncoordinated.",1091750400,7,504,4.372340425531915
2005497,5,B0001IN0C6,"I highly recommend it. It's a good workout for the nights I can't make it to the gym, plus I've learned some cool moves. It's not P90x nor instructions to be a professional dancer, but if you're just looking for a fun average workout DVD, this might be for you.",1391904000,,261,4.24
2005498,5,B0001IN0C6,This is a very good belly dance workout DVD. I have several beginner and beginner/intermediate belly dance DVD's so I found the moves easy to follow. The routines are enjoyable and I broke a sweat! It is a good workout for me. Kathy is a cool instructor and looks lovely for a non-professional belly dancer doing the moves. The back-up dancers are all gorgeous and are professional and/or more experienced belly dancers. Ansuya is wonderful to watch and follow as well.,1377216000,,469,4.802469135802469
2005499,5,B0001IN0C6,I have been a fan of Kathy Smith for a long time. This work out is a great alternative to a regular abs workout.,1371859200,,112,3.7083333333333335
2005500,5,B0001IN0C6,"I know, I know, Kathy Smith is not a professional or even an advanced bellydancer...but neither am I.  She obviously worked very hard with a pro and then had some amazing bellydancers in the video with her.  I appreciated that very much.  As a beginning bellydancer that has only been taking lessons for a few months....I was encouraged that a very fit, longtime fitness enthusiast such as Kathy Smith couldn't do the moves perfectly either. I like the short instructional portion immensely and think the video was worth the price just for that alone.  I also like the work-out.  It was very doable for someone at my level and a good work-out. If you are a professional bellydancer or even a very advanced one then you probably can't get past Kathy's lower bellydance ability, but personally I love the video. Kathy has the same stiffness that I have trying to do the shoulder shimmies!  haha  :0)",1367366400,3,897,4.711538461538462
2005501,5,B0001IN0C6,"I've been using this dvd a couple times a week for about a month now.  The dvd is broken down into two segments.  One segment is slow sensual moves, the other is a dance routine. I try to do both routine, but if I'm short on time, I stick with slow sensual moves.  I'm glad Kathy Smith is leading it.  Kathy does look a little stiff in some of the movements and it's obvious that she is new to this type of workout, but that's another thing I like.  I'm a bit stiff and I'm slowing loosening up.  Kathy's slow sensual moves are very helpful to me.  I don't feel rushed with learning choreography.  I feel like the moves are slow enough for me to grasp but I'm also getting a moderate workout.  I plan to move to more advanced workout but right now, I'm enjoying this dvd.",1357776000,,771,4.155405405405405
2005502,3,B0001IN0C6,"I thought this video interesting. My Mom told me Kathy Smith tends to Prostitute herself with whatever the latest fad is and I find it true in this video. I have a hard time following Kathy in this video her body type is interesting and doesn't seem to show off the moves quite so well. I find myself watching the girl in the back more than I do her. Its good for basics and it does give you quite a workout if that is what you are looking for but I would rather get a video from a professional belly dancer. I would have actually liked to get a video from the girl in the back and who does the dance solo she's amazing!
So if you are looking for just basic basic workout and belly dance instruction this is a good start. If you get it watch the girl in the back on some moves and not Kathy!",1328054400,,791,3.981132075471698
2005503,5,B0001IN0C6,"I have been using Kathy Smith's video workouts since she first broke out on the scene back in the 80's.  I have in fact re-purchased her videos as they have worn out and/or needed upgrading to DVD.  As for Flex Appeal, I absolutely loved it.  As my first introduction to the world of belly dance I found it easy to follow, yet challenging enough to sink my teeth into.  Through this video, I was introduced to Ansuya, and many others from there.  Who knows if I will ever come out of the closet with the belly dancing.  But anyone that knows me, knows that Kathy Smith has her own shelf in my DVD rack, and she has made a believer, and a loyal follower out of me!  Rock on, Kathy!",1300147200,,680,4.184615384615385
2005504,3,B0001IN0C6,"I love to dance but I am not exactly ""in shape"". So I decided to get something fun and sexy to add to my cardio routine. I was expecting more of a cardio toning type of belly dancing DVD but there was more dancing than a workout. There are fun belly dancing moves, but I expected to feel SOMETHING in my tummy area or break a sweat after doing the 24 minute sensual section where Kathy shows you the steps and the 20 min. Heat It Up section.

On the other hand, it is a pretty neat dvd for women who don't know much about belly dancing and want to get some movements down. The Backup dancers are great and Ansuya is great to watch. Her solos are fun to incorporate all the moves Kathy teaches.",1294963200,,693,4.095588235294118
2005505,5,B0001IN0C6,"I really like this dvd and the routines are easy to follow. Kathy explains the steps and goes through the movements at a nice pace. A lot of belly dance dvd's are faster paced and (for those of us that aren't always coordinated) can be difficult to keep up. This routine is great for anyone who is new (like me) to this type of dance. Just watching the routines made me think that maybe it was too easy and that I wouldn't get a good cardio. That wasn't true once I began to move. It was easy, fun, time flew, and I did perspire (women don't sweat).
I own most of Kathy's videos (mostly 80's & 90's now on DVD- repackaged) and I adore her.",1292284800,2,639,4.12
2005506,5,B0001IN0C6,"I gotta say I enjoyed this one.  I thought it had a nice flow, and, in the faster portion, it was like doing a dance.  Kathy is just so endearing to me.  She's willing to get out there and do her thing, even if she looks goofy. She always seems confident, and like she's having a good time.  I thought she cued well.

Is she a perfect bellydancer?  No, but, she's probably like a lot of people who haven't studied bellydance for very long. She's ok at the moves, if a bit stiff. It's nice to have the pros to watch for variety, and, something to aspire to.

Though it does have the weaknesses that other reviewers have pointed out, this dvd will give you some bellydance basics, and a nice workout.",1279584000,3,698,4.242424242424242
2005507,5,B0001IN0C6,"Fun!! This is a relaxing way to end a workout or do on your ""off days"". Great sensual dance that anyone can do, and your hubby or boyfriend will love to see what you've learned ;)",1272067200,,179,4.0
2005508,4,B0001IN0C6,"This is a very good beginner's level workout. Surely Kathy is stiff and not so good at belly dancing, but the other dancers are pretty good, and their outfits are a pleasure to look at. This workout covered quite a few classic moves of belly dance, and the whole workout is very well structured, keeps you move and having fun and feeling feminine and pretty at the same time.",1264464000,,375,4.449275362318841
2005509,5,B0001IN0C6,"I've been interested in the art of Belly Dance for years, and have purchased many books and videos on the subject. Books are no good in learning dance moves because you can't see the action. DVDs are great because you can mirror and pause and rewind until you get the moves right. Most of the other videos I've watched are too long and repetitive. Kathy Smith creates two workouts which spend just enough time on each move before changing to another. The sets and costuming are great, as is the sound quality. I really enjoy doing this workout and feel wonderful afterwards!",1261699200,3,574,4.637254901960785
2005510,5,B0001IN0C6,"I've seen the other reviews for this DVD saying it's just not the best out there, especially b/c Kathy Smith is not a belly dancer and is stiff, etc.

With complete respect to those reviewers who know much, much more than I about belly dancing -- I know NOTHING -- I have to say that I love, love, love this DVD.

I am clumsy and not very well coordinated but Kathy does a great job of cueing--reminding you to tuck your tummy and especially to keep your knees bent--and ESPECIALLY of sharing her enthusiasm.

I love how feminine, yet how athletic, this DVD leaves me feeling. I'm moving parts of my abdomen I didn't know were there. And as much as I need a good Jillian Michaels kick in the pants from time to time, it's nice to do a DVD where it's more about fluidity rather than burn and pain!

This is the first DVD I've done in a while where I actually lost track of time. Fun, fun, fun!

I've done a lot of Kathy Smith's tapes and while she has a tendency to whoop and holler, there is none of that here.

The other dancers are fantastic and I watch them as well for technique.

This is definitely NOT for advanced belly dancers. Try it if you just want to dip your toe in!",1257811200,4,1179,4.167400881057269
2005511,4,B0001IN0C6,"You have to have patience to learn these new steps, shoulders, hips, [...], and hand movement's feel awkward at first.  I'm slowly getting them dowm;the DVD is more like dancing then exercises to me.",1250726400,,199,4.852941176470588
2005512,5,B0001IN0C6,"This dvd is great! I've only been using it for a couple of weeks, but it's the most fun I've ever had trying to incorporate working out into my lifestyle. While KS herself is by no means a professional belly dancer, she is really great at breaking down the moves and explaining them in a technical way for beginners. Once you've got the basics down, you can look in the background at Ansuya and the other dancers to get a better idea of how to perfect the moves (there's also a small clip where Ansuya explains a few moves in her own words if you need extra tips). The best part about this is once you learn enough, you don't always need to watch the video to work out -- just putting on some music and making up your own impromptu dances keeps things entertaining. Plus, you feel really sexy doing it! I would definitely recommend this for anyone that gets bored doing regular workouts, or just wants to try something new!",1248220800,2,923,4.372093023255814
2005513,5,B0001IN0C6,"Although Kathy Smith is not a bellydancer, she has real bellydancers dancing with her(one being Ansuya) so you can watch them to get the fluidity of the moves. I love this DVD and recommend it to anyone, because Kathy Smith is such a great teacher, but you get to dance the whole time...you're not standing there listening to the instructor talk...you're moving the whole time. I love that fact, because some dvds you are just waiting around with slow instruction. This has a 20 minute slow routine followed by a 3 minute slow dance to follow along with, then a 20 minute fast routine and an about 10 minute cool down of gentle yoga based stretching. There is also a tutorial with Ansuya and a solo performance by Ansuya.",1243900800,2,721,4.596899224806202
2005514,5,B0001IN0C6,"I have been  using this video, both VHS and DVD since December of 2004 and my waistline is now 26-27 inches, even after 5 (yes, five) children. So to all the naysayers, I don't know what you're talking about. Sounds like jealousy and envy to me.

I had never belly danced before, but now, I feel like a pro. Ansuya, an award winning dancer, is very visible in the background, and her presence makes everyone look like a pro. Sure Kathy Smith is not a pro belly dancer, but she looks good as she shows us that even amateurs can learn the health-benefiting movements of this form of workout. Kathy's way of teaching is very systematic, with counting, and easy to follow along.

The wonderful thing about this video is that it's a COMPLETE WORKOUT. You learn the basics of belly dance, you get aerobics, then you a great cool down with stretching, yoga, and pilates. There's even a tutorial with Ansuya showing us all how to fine-tune our belly-dance movements.

So to all the ""Kathy Smith"" haters, shame on you!

BTW: I bought her ""Latin Dance Workout"" and even though it's very taxing and you gotta already be in pretty good shape, I now feel completely confident when I go to a Latin club. I can keep up with some of the best Latin dancers on the dance floor. They even stand back and watch me.

You GO Kathy! Keep on bringing us new and exciting ways to stay in shape.

Sincerely,
Cary

PS: Before this video, after my 5th child, I had severe back pain and was taking Naprisin for back pain and muscle spasms in my back. Soon after I started doing this video workout, my back pain went away and has never returned. Even after almost 5 years, this is my favorite workout video. I just completed the workout today and feel like a belly-dance Goddess.  THANK YOU KATHY & ANSUYA!",1240444800,,1776,4.44
2005515,3,B0001IN0C6,"This is a great starters DVD for Ansuya fans.  Ansuya works with Kathy Smith to put together a choreography you learn, and dance to.  Features other known Belly Dancers in the background.  This workout is good if you want to learn new movements, watch Ansuya's techniques or style, and do not mind a workout.  Realistically you may work with this DVD a few times, and then move on to better material.  Namaste.",1239840000,,410,4.638888888888889
2005516,5,B0001IN0C6,"It makes me sad to read reviews that trash Kathy Smith for making this dvd since she is not a professional belly dancer. True, Kathy Smith is not a professional belly dancer - nor does she ever claim to be - but she is an enthusiastic beginner (like I was, once upon a time) who will lead you through a fun and sexy dance fitness routine.

This dvd provides a great, low impact workout for anyone wanting to get back in shape. It's also a wonderful way to de-stress after a long, hard day. I've been taking bellydance classes for 5+ years, have performed in a dance troupe and, despite the fact that I own many intermediate/advanced belly dance dvds, I gotta say that this little gem by Kathy Smith is STILL one of my favorites to work with! It's relaxing, refreshing and just plain fun.

Kathy's dvd is perfect for what it is - a belly dance workout.  It is not a dvd that teaches belly dance as an art form. Anyone looking to learn true belly dance should check out the many dvds from World Dance New York or Michelle Joyce. They provide high quality belly dance instruction as low prices.  However, if all you are looking for is an entertaining, delightfully ""girly"" way to get toned than buy Kathy Smith's dvd. It's well worth it!",1235260800,7,1234,4.399122807017544
2005524,4,B0001IN0C6,"I bought this used (new in package) through Amazon, and while the package says it has the bonus dance and the ""behind the scenes"" chapters--the DVD does not. Only the main two workouts, the slow dance, flex segment and the tutorial are on this DVD.

And as far as the ""slow dance"" at the end of the first workout section, while you can chapter to it from your remote, it is not separately titled in the menu.  How do I know? I had borrowed the DVD previously, and that one says at the beginning ""Sony Music Entertainment"" and has a different menu, with a separate chapter for the slow dance, as well as the separate bonus menu.

As to the workout itself, it would have been much better if Ansuya and Kathy had been side by side throughout the video, instead of only during the tutorial.  Also, Kathy's green tie-top in the first section was very distracting with the wide sleeves and the tie hanging down (part of learning is seeing the belly area as well as the arms).

The second section was good, but Kathy's costume did nothing to show off her new-found dancing ability--the skirt was made of a straight front and a straight back, and only emphasized that she didn't have a belly dance type of body (no knock on her, she's in great shape). Could have done without the whooping, however.

The flexibility section at the end is really nice, and good for a cooldown after any type of workout.

I hope she does another video with Ansuya, with side-by-side instruction, and also a lot more profile instead of three-quarter-view camera angles. This is a good beginner's workout, but again, the Goldhil version does NOT have the bonus features.",1232323200,,1641,4.580204778156997
2005525,5,B0001IN0C6,"I bought this with the intent to use it for an ab workout and to get a little introduction into bellydancing. Since Kathy Smith is not a professional belly dancer I actually find her easier to follow than other videos I've attempted. She explains things well, and does not move too quickly, which is what I often find to be the problem with dance videos. She is SURROUNDED by professional belly dancers, and I do not think she is doing anything significantly worse than they are-- in fact, I was impressed! There's an additional training session with HER belly dancing teacher if you want some more tips.

The workout was very efficient-- I found myself very worked at the end, but throughout the vieo it was so fun I didn't even notice the workout I was getting!! This is especially fun to do in a little group, if you're not too embarrassed!

Definitely this video is for girls, and it makes you feel very sexy once you get the moves down. Way worth the purchase-- have fun!!",1231200000,9,977,4.5141242937853105
2005526,2,B0001IN0C6,"Kathy Smith does not know enough about belly dancing to teach it. The most helpful part of the DVD is the tutorial that explains what you should be doing with your body when doing some moves. This part of the DVD is not taught by Kathy, but by an experience dancer. If the whole DVD were that detailed it would be 5 stars. I also feel that there was no enough attention give to keeping proper posture while dancing in order to prevent back injury.",1231113600,,447,4.270588235294118
2005527,4,B0001IN0C6,"I believe this is still a good workout even thought KS is not a bellydancer. I got this video when it first came out and use it when I am low on time, it is broken down into two twenty minute workouts.  Also the 10 minute stretch at the end is very nice.",1210982400,7,254,3.792452830188679
2005528,4,B0001IN0C6,"I like to add new workouts to my routine to hold my interest, and I wanted to try bellydancing. I was a little intimidated by the descriptions of more formal teaching DVDs, not being as in-shape as I would like to be before undertaking the real deal. I read the reviews of Kathy Smith's Flex Appeal Belly Dance Workout and decided it might be a good place for a complete (and somewhat klutzy) novice to start.

As others have noted, Kathy is not the expert here. It is evident right away which of the dancers is Ansuya, by her classic movements as much as her classic figure. I would have liked to see Ansuya at the front, even co-leading with Kathy if Ms. Smith didn't wish to give up the spotlight. I don't think it's so much that Kathy doesn't *know* the movements; the unfortunate fact is, her body is just not *built* for bellydancing. Oh, she gives it the old college try and puts the newbies in the home audience at ease. But her figure does not lend itself to the deliberate and sensual movements that a small waist and curvy hips can bring to the dance. By no means is this Kathy's fault. Let's remember that she is an athlete and worked hard to get her body into the shape its in! It's just not the shape for classic bellydancing. She looks tense and blocky when attempting the movements; she really has no hips to sway and can't move her knees fast enough to shimmy. But even so, she looks as happy to be dancing as any of us should while working out with her.

Having said that, the DVD is shot nicely, with great colors and costumes and sexy lighting. It's a fun workout! I'm not a bellydancer, but I can see how anyone with even a smidge of experience might find this DVD tedious and dull - but it's not a course, it's a workout. What it did for me was (a) give me enough confidence to shake and shimmy in the privacy of my own home and (b) pique my interest in the art form...so much so that I snapped up one of Ansuya's DVDs on ebay.

Kathy Smith, while perhaps not an expert, brings bellydancing to more homes by way of this DVD. If you've never bellydanced, consider Flex Appeal even as a rental. And when you've gotten some basic moves down (look at the ladies in the back more often to see proper form) move on to something more challenging and authentic. Get inspired! I will happily delve into this classic and beautiful artform in the future with expert bellydancers like Ansuya and others.",1205971200,,2413,4.34589800443459
2005529,5,B0001IN0C6,"Many reviewers comment on K. Smith's lack of total expertise in belly dance.  Against this admittedly true and valid point, why not consider the following:

- Smith cues very well, is very personable, and her enthusiasm is charming
- Ansuya is never far from view, and she is the belly dancer to beat all, in my opinion; the other ladies also contribute well to an understanding of how the moves are done
- the various belly dance moves are fun and interesting
- the pace is good, with just the right amount of instruction
- the set is well designed and very tasteful
- the program is well organized and appealingly shot, with good production values
- all the ladies look lovely.  It is perhaps slightly unfortunate that Smith's midsection is on the masculine side, with rather little curve in it, but that has almost no effect on how she demonstrates the moves. And if, for example, she is not quite doing front-back-back on the hip drop, the other dancers are, and it's clear what should be done even if Smith has some difficulty with it (shoulder shimmies seem to give her a lot of trouble, but I happen to find them easy)
- the music is excellent, enhancing the atmosphere in a general way but also providing perfect accompaniment for the dancing
- there is an upmarket feel about the program:  just the right degree of exoticism but no louche overtones
- Smith gives much air time and credit to Ansuya, who also provides demonstration dances and a tutorial

In sum, well worth the money.  I go back to it often, and I'm glad that Kathy Smith made this adventurous foray into a rewarding endeavor.",1194652800,8,1601,4.580419580419581
2005530,5,B0001IN0C6,"I have been excercising with Kathy Smith's workouts since the early days and especially enjoyed her pregnancy workout. Quality of production, workouts, sets, teaching technique and background dancers are always top notch and this video does not dissappoint. By the end of the first workout, I felt comfortable with the dance elements and loved the different feel of the belly dance workout than anything else I've ever done. I think this wll be enjoyed by those who like their workouts to feel more dancey than boot campy. If you like jazzercise and aerobic dance, this is so much fun to add to your rotation. It is a moderate workout but can be toned down depending on your level. Probably not for someonw used to burning 1,000 calories per workout though. A good intro to belly dancing, but also probably not for someone looking to learn advanced techniques. For me it was the perfect combo of dance and workout that I was looking for.

Don't buy a video from someone who has taken a few lessons and doesn't know how to dance.  I'm sure her knowledge of fitness and exercise is fine.  Kathy Smith just isn't a dancer.  Even at the low-low price of $9.98, this video is over-priced.  In my opinion.",1188950400,12,356,4.415384615384616
2005532,4,B0001IN0C6,"I have three belly dance videos to work out with and I actually like this one.  I thought the slow moves were easy to follow and it is a work out that keeps me off the floor, where my two dogs add resistance training to all workouts.  I will keep using this one.",1180396800,3,262,3.9245283018867925
2005533,5,B0001IN0C6,"Although I've done dance and aerobics for nearly 25 years, I'm not a belly dancing expert and just wanted a good, instructional video that gave me an enjoyable workout while teaching me some new moves. This video delivered. If you're an expert, this video is not for you. As someone said previously: go to a class if you want more. I love Kathy Smith; she has fun with what she does and inspires me to do the same.

The video starts slow with an instructional format. I could really feel the burn from this section, merely because I was working muscles (especially in my back and waist) that I don't normally work. The music, set, and dancers are beautiful. There's a brief ""Sensual Dance"" at the end of this section, lead by her expert instructor Ansuya, that doesn't do much for me, so I just skip ahead to the second section.

The second section is where you pick up the pace and practice everything you just learned. The music is fun and inspirational, and I have no problem with Kathy's ""wooo!"" in this section. I feel the same way! It's a *workout*, and you definitely get one. The other thing I really love about this workout is that I don't even have to put my tennis shoes on -- I can throw on some shorts and go.

Now, if you want further instruction, Kathy and Ansuya have a special section on the DVD in which they talk you through the moves more thoroughly. Belly dancing may not be Kathy's forte, per se, but she always has an expert close at hand. This isn't supposed to be the ""rocket science"" of belly dancing -- it's supposed to be fun, and it delivers!",1165190400,5,1571,4.391752577319588
2005554,3,B0001IN0C6,"Mom2raiandjas wrote a great review. I have tried Kathy Smith's previous Latin dancing & Kickboxing DVDs. She obviously has an ego or self-esteem issue & though she can't dance, or is a gold metal 6th degree blackbelt she has to be front & center with the camera on her 85% of the time for both workouts.
This DVD is best only for those who already have bellydance instructional dvds by PROFESSIONAL bellydancers such as Neena & Veena or Jillian, Neon, etc. There is very little instruction & Kathy just has to be surrounded by tall columns with big beautiful fabric that obstructs all the dancers that are about 10 feet behind her. Kathy can't dance, can't execute the moves correctly, moves very stiffly & fast as if in a rush.
The only thing that is good about this DVD is the pace of the workout. They teach (could be more instruction though by far) as they start at a slow pace & then speed it up. There are no rest periods. I've had several  in the past like this, such as Neena & Veenas, some other latin dance ones, etc. All workouts should be like this & most are finally catching on. The only other thing is the beautiful set, the quality of production.
The dance at the end by Anysa didn't do much for me, I think Neena & Veena, Jillian, Bianca & Neon are much better by far.

You can see a preview at collagevideo com for this & many of Kathy's other DVDs",1160524800,11,1366,4.33203125
2005555,4,B0001IN0C6,"It's true that Kathy Smith is no bellydancer--but this workout is fun and allows those who don't aspire to professional bellydancing to have a good time and get some pleasure out of moving their bodies. With her typical good humor and likability, Kathy proves that you don't have to be a professional to enjoy dancing, and there's real value in that!

If you want to become a professional bellydancer, choose another dvd (better yet, take some classes). If you just want a little exercise that actually feels good (though admittedly isn't very aerobic or terribly challenging), this dvd provides a nice change of pace. And it's fun--which not many workouts are.",1149811200,11,661,4.954954954954955
2005556,4,B0001IN0C6,I was looking for a good workout that I can do in the morning before work.  I really enjoyed this one because it explains the moves well so that I didn't get totally lost.  I think this is a great beginners video and fun too!,1148169600,4,225,3.977777777777778
2005557,5,B0001IN0C6,"""Workout"" is the key word. This is an exercise video, NOT a how to belly dance video. Experienced dancers should probably look elsewhere. But if you are a non-dancer, this is a fun way to get your heart rate up. There are two 20-minute routines that you can do separately or combine, plus a 10-minute cool down. Unlike some belly dance videos in which the dancers move their hips in only one direction, in this video Kathy Smith does plenty of changes of direction so muscles are worked equally on both sides. Moves are broken down and explained thoroughly, so it is easy to follow along, even for a klutz like me!",1146182400,17,614,4.491071428571429
2005558,4,B0001IN0C6,"I'm not sure why I bought this one. It could have been that I had a 25% off coupon at the bookstore, I needed a payday treat, they didn't have the Jillina DVD I was looking for and nothing else they did have interested me. I already own four of what I think are the best bellydance DVD's out there: Sonia & Issam, Jillina, Rachel Brice and Atea. I certainly didn't need another one. Since my goal is to become an instructor, I do want to look at different teaching styles. I guess I decided to try it when I read that Ansuya was involved and the DVD had a bonus solo performance. I figured anything with Ansuya couldn't be a total loss. She is an incredible dancer and one of the most sought-after performers and instructors in the country.

The first surprise was that I immediately recognized Stevie from the Bellydance Superstars. Upon reading the credits, I found that the more voluptuous dancer I was proud of Kathy for including is Louchia, who I've heard of but haven't seen perform.

Next, it really is a good workout that actively employs bellydance. The slow workout helps beginners learn the moves and is good practice for the intermediate.  The fast workout is fun and great for burning fat. You'll really work your muscles, especially your abs, in both workouts. I have been dancing for about seven months and found it challenging enough to keep me interested, and I was a little sore the next day, especially in the obliques. The fact that the workout is structured so that the moves flow like an actual dance is this DVD's main strength.

Now for the criticisms - thank Goddess that Ansuya was there. Kathy's verbal instruction isn't the best. There's  a brief tutorial with Ansuya at the end of the workout that offers a lot of great instruction in about five minutes - a lot more than Kathy offers in half an hour. Kathy rushes Ansuya through it and rudely interrupts her several times, prompting me to think, ""What's the rush?"" The photography is better than most videos in that you have a good visual of the movement, helpful because the verbal cues are lacking. Ansuya's tutorial is listed on the menu after the workout when it should have been first, so watch it before you start, especially if you are a beginner. There's not quite enough time spent on breaking down the basic moves during the workout.

And speaking of cues - Kathy should have worked on changing her cuing style for this one. She sounds more like she's teaching aerobics than bellydance in both workouts, which didn't take long to get on my nerves. I want my bellydance practice to be more sensual and relaxing. Bellydance has become almost as spiritual as yoga for me. This type of cuing kind of ruins that. ""Give it to me now!"" and those wierd aerobics instructor grunting and howling noises just don't work in a bellydance workout. Kathy should have asked Ansuya to teach her how to zaghareet! In fact, she contradicts one of the most beautiful things about bellydance - it makes positive changes in your body without feeling like a workout.

And I honestly do not mean to sound mean here......at the beginning of the workout Kathy says that she loves bellydance because it makes her feel sexy, but Kathy is absolutely the least sensuous woman I have ever seen bellydance. It's pitiful. She calls the slow workout a ""sensuous"" workout, but you'll have to add your own sensuality. Although it's obvious that Kathy really worked with Ansuya to learn bellydance, that graceful, feminine quality we admire and feel in our art is just not there. You can take the girl out of the gym but you can't take the gym out of the girl..... Kathy's hair and makeup are nicely done and they put her in a pretty costume, but she still looks like an athlete trying to bellydance. It seems that she can't get out of workout mode. Although she's doing the moves correctly, Kathy is working out, not dancing. Again, thank Goddess there are four sensuous dancers to counteract that but we don't see enough of them. In the second workout, Kathy is too far up front and they are way in the back.  There are a few closeups of them but Stevie, an excellent dancer, doesn't get much camera time at all. She's so far off to the side that I wasn't sure at first if that was her or a mirror image of Kathy. Ansuya and possibly another one of the dancers should have been right up front with Kathy instead of in the back like students. Kathy would have been smarter to do that since it would have taken some of the focus off her. Watch these dancers, not Kathy, to get a better idea of how it's done.

There are actually two solo performances by Ansuya. The first is part of the workout, where she demonstrates the moves that have just been taught in a short choreography, and the second is a brief - too brief - performance in costume in the bonus features. The ""Behind the Scenes Bonus"" feature is simply a one or two minute clip of Kathy and the dancers making the video, nothing special. The cooldown session is a great stretch and very relaxing, and it would be a good idea to do it first as a warmup, especially if you are only going to do the fast workout.

It's taken me two years to recover from my second back surgery and seven months of dancing to finally be ready to work toward getting back to the excellent shape I used to be in. I'll use this one when I feel energetic and want more cardio for fat burning.

Whether you like Kathy Smith or not, she's respected in the field and has a following. I think she's one of the better video instructors out there - far superior to Denise Austin - but she should have adapted her style to fit the workout.  I am glad that she made an effort to bring bellydance to more women but I wish she'd done a better job. A brief history of the dance to help educate the public would have helped. I do give her a lot of credit for taking the time to actually learn bellydance from an expert.

I've worked out with videos for about 20 years now and have come to realize that they must be quite difficult to make. Even the best have their faults, mainly with cuing and photography. I've come to the conclusion that none are perfect and the actual workout is what counts. Criticisms of the instructor aside, this is still a very good workout and you will actually be learning real bellydance moves instead of doing aerobics that mimic bellydancing. I gave it four stars because as a workout, it's envigorating and safe and would be effective when practiced regularly. It's suitable for all levels. Each workout is only about 20 minutes long and that's great for those who are short on time. The choreography is fun and easy to pick up, especially if you have some bellydance experience.

This DVD can help keep your body looking it's best in your costume. And hey, you can always buy it to watch Ansuya!

2005559,5,B0001IN0C6,"To me this is a Fun BellyDance workout! I enjoyed the dance, costumes and the place! I appreciate that Kathy Smith tried to change alittle! This is good for everyone to change and experinece something different once in awhile! In this workout, Kathy Smith would be a role model to many of those of you who are scared to try something new and challenging. Kathy Smith is not a belly dancer but I admire her for trying to do it! Not only you would notice that she can't dance it but also she doesn't have the right body for it, so what! For those of you who are beginners and want to add some fun to your bellydance, I advice you to try this one cuz it is really fun! However, I've seen many BellyDance vidoes for beginners but most of them are boring or even hard to follow! So why not try something you would enjoy to follow!",1145145600,10,825,4.19496855345912

I've always been a fan of Kathy Smiths so I thought this would be good, but I didn't expect it to be this good.  It's fun and a well-structured introduction to bellydancing.  In the warm up, you learn the moves, and in the actual workout, you put those moves to the test to a faster rhythym.  There are regular basic hip circles and then there are more exotic moves like a Camel.  I really love the way they used the traditional costumes and used traditional middle eastern music.  It's fun, and before you know it, you'll have burned heaps of calories and sweated quite a bit.",1144454400,7,720,4.296296296296297
2005561,4,B0001IN0C6,"Man, a lot of people are mad at Kathy Smith for trying something new!  I like this video.  To me, it is one of the funnest, well-produced Bellydance videos on the market.  I've tried the ones with the twins (too repetitive) and Rania (not my fave instructor, blah) and got bored.  I like the costumes, music and sets of this video.  Sure, Kathy may be a little more stiff than the professional belly dancers, but that shouldn't surprise anyone.  I thought she still did a pretty good job!  Plus, there are plenty of opportunities to watch the dancers in back of her to develop different styles of the moves.  This video has a 20-minute warmup that teaches the moves, then a 20-minute routine to use them in a workout, a 10-minute stretching routine, and a bonus 3-minute dance to learn on your own.  My one complaint is that I don't feel like I've worked out after completing this video, so it's best for a lighter day.  Bottom line:  Good intro to belly dance video.",1138752000,14,967,4.5
2005562,4,B0001IN0C6,"I saw this video on a clip from collagevideo.com (that's a good way to pre-view the dvd before you buy it). It looked like it would be a good 'workout video', not instruction. It also shows that Kathy is really just learning herself. If you have experience with bellydance just do the moves correctly and you'll get a good workout. If you have no clue about bellydance and you want a workout video get 'Basic moves' by Neena and Veena. The camera does move to Ansuya alot so you can see the fluid, graceful moves (what it should look like), and Ansuya's costumes are beautiful. It is a great workout and fun! So if you know basic moves already get the video and do it correctly, that simple, and you'll get a great aerobic workout. If you don't know bellydance learn the moves from class or the video I recommended. A fantastic site for great and real bellydance performance and instruction is VisionaryDance.com, there is also an absolute beginner dvd. Delilah is one of the greatest bellydancers I have ever seen perform.",1138406400,5,1023,4.626373626373627

But that's get old. Kathy Smith shows how the movement is performed and has you practice it a few times, then shows you something else. Definitely, not boring!!!!  And Ansuya does a solo performance that is really beautiful and easy to follow.

After suffering from a lengthy illness however, I'm desperately fighting just to be in any kind of shape at all.  Enter again Kathy Smith, since this video gets me up moving and feeling great, which is something I haven't felt in such a long time.  I think this video is a beautiful start to me getting into some 'hard core' belly dancing later, and in the meantime, Kathy has kept my interest in moving my body.",1137456000,4,588,4.416666666666667

I don't know what she was thinking, but someone should have told her that she looked ridiculous trying to teach what she does not know.  She is crazy for having her Belly Dance Instructor as a background dancer, what was she thinking??  Gosh, the whole time the background dancers out-danced her.  LOL, I saw her Merenge-Salsa video, and its the same shame.  I am a professional Latin Dancer, born into the dance, and honestly she does need to stick to what she knows.  She is so stiff,its funny to watch her dance.  Get this DVD for a workout only, believe me even if you are a beginner I am sure you'll out-dance her too.",1126224000,3,714,4.2835820895522385

Ms. Smith is barely capable of executing the many of the movements she teaches, which I feel is irresponsible. I gave the dvd three stars instead, based on the overall workout value and that being able to watch Ansuya and the other dancers executing the movements behind Kathy somewhat redeems the dvd.

I actually do enjoy doing the workout routines, so I would recommend the dvd .. but, would do so with a cautionary word on Kathy Smith's bellydance ability .. or, lack of it.",1125705600,4,584,4.561904761904762

For example, Kathy's top isn't tight enough to see her arm movements, but that is okay because we can see the other dancers movements nicely. Now, this is a beginners/intermediate workout so don't expect to be burnt out unless you don't exercise regulrarly. Also, the other dancers don't have rock hard bodies or a model bodies. I thought it was better then the Veena and Nina and Rana videos. I also enjoyed te music and the stage setting.",1118620800,3,593,4.4

However, don't be fooled just because it is Kathy Smith that you will get a good cardio workout - if you are intermediate or advanced you probably won't break a sweat. This tape is FUN if you are a beginner to exercise or if you just want to learn something new. It's also good for those 'off days' when you know you should exercise but aren't feeling quite up to a strenous workout.
  Some advice: Wear a sash/scarf or something around your waist -you might feel silly but it DOES help with the hip movements
  Note that even though the dancers are barefoot, I found that I needed the extra ankle support of my crosstrainers.",1117756800,,736,4.462686567164179
2005579,4,B0001IN0C6,"I was a bit thrown when I first saw this title, because I'd never have thought of Kathy Smith doing a belly dance workout  - I wasn't sure what I'd find.  But it was actually pretty good.  If you're looking for something that is strictly about belly dance technique, keep looking (or watch the dancers in the background).  Kathy is still learning, and is a bit stiff (her technique is a bit 'jock', I find), but bless her, she tries really hard.  But if you want a fun workout, this is a great dvd.  I can actually get motivated enough to do this, and that's saying something.  All of the sections are quite good (although you might want to watch through the fast section a few times to get an idea of some of the moves).

The only problem I had, and it's not really that big of a deal, is that Kathy gets a bit out of time with the music sometimes, especially with the vocal instruction.  I marched competitive Drum Corps for 5 years, and if nothing else, I can keep my movements in time with the music.  If Kathy seems a bit off, watch the other dancers, though.  But all in all, it's a good dvd, fun to do and a great workout.",1113264000,2,1129,4.180555555555555
2005580,4,B0001IN0C6,"Kathy Smith is a great fitness instructor but obviously does not have belly dancing in her blood (And I don't mean that as an ethnic comment.) I actually didn't mind this, however, because it was less intimidating for a beginner and I didn't feel like such an unexotic cludz watching her. I usually have no problem dancing but this beautiful form of dance takes a while to get the feel. It's not easy. But Kathy starts slowly and builds it up from the basics to the more challanging. She is encouraging throughout without being too chirpy which was a relief. Sometimes, however I had to strain to watch the more fluid movements of the bellydancers in the background because it seemed that like me, Kathy just wasn't getting it. There are many easy arm movements in bellydance but she only used snake arms throughout which made it a little bland. She also seemed to enjoy doing wrist circles constantly but never explained how these were done. Like anything else, it's easy once you know how. A minor flaw though. She did spend enough time on each move but didn't always explain the isolations well. Sometimes I felt that she was too eager to show off what she'd learned. She does cover the basics and a slow and sensual dance pulls together what you've worked on so far and is well in the realm of possibility. The last part Kathy picks up the tempo and really has you dancing. It's a fun way to get a workout and having the professional bellydancer, Ansuya, on the stage inspired me to really learn the art of the dance and I'm taking lessons. It did give me some basics to bring into the bellydance lessons. What I liked the most about this video as a whole was it didn't take the monkey see monkey do tact to learning. I've ordered other dellydancing DVD's and know after getting the moves down on this one I just might have a chance at following along. Although Kathy is a bit of a fish out of water that's okay with me because so am I -- at least for a while. I just hope she isn't teaching me bad form. I have a feeling this is far from the real thing but, in all fairness, she presents it as a fitness video and if she wanted to jump on the bandwagon with the bellydance craze she made a wise business decision. I wouldn't put her down for that but if you really want to learn the art of bellydance plan on taking lessons and buying more DVD's.",1110499200,8,2351,4.357630979498861

She always seems to have her pulse on the latest trends and she has found a way to turn bellydancing into a ""workout"" format. Every move is broken down into individual steps, and it is very slow-paced. The end result is not very artistically appealing. If you are interested in the art of bellydancing, this video would be a tremendous disappointment.

When I did the video I could see how kathy was a tad bit more stiff then the other women, but those women profesionally belly dance so its not fair to critique kathy when she just learned, I myself thought kathy did it better then me lol.  I thought geez if these people think she is bad I must be horrible.  But I feel like I learned these simple moves and they were very easy to learn I must say and I definately got A GREAT ab workout, I seriously have a sore stomach from the moves, and I did sweat.  I really enjoyed this DVD because it was exactly what i was looking for a fun workout that included something i wanted to learn a little bit of which is belly dancing.

I have several other tapes of Kathy Smith - her instructions are clear and easy to follow, and her ever enthusiastic energy is infectious. She keeps it simple enough for either beginners or for those ""coordinatedly-challenged"", yet this offers a nice variety from your regular fitness routine, and can easily be used as a *very* enjoyable way to spend your ""day off"" (from your regular 'hard workout days').

Kathy Smith is very approachable yet the workouts are effective (mostly on the beginner/intermediate levels). She also lets you know how to do the moves safely while offering different variations to make it more of a challenge while the others w/her continue on.

Although she has Superstar Ansuyu working with her, (a bellydancer since age 4), Kathy does the instruction for the video and breaks the moves down so that a basic to an advanced bellydancer can workout.  You start with isolations at a very good pace, move to a slow and sensual follow-me dance, then Heat It Up with a 20 minute cardio bellydance session.  You break into a sweat at the end but don't all out bead.  You finish off with a cool down that incorporates yoga, stretching, and pilates.  The music is upbeat and sticks in your head.  In all, one amazing bellydance tape.  Kathy Smith is an exercise guru for a reason and you get a full body workout.  This dvd is definately worth every penny.  I use it EVERY day and look forward to doing it each and every time!  No more excuses to not exercise, this dvd is FUN!  You'll fall in love with it and WANT to do it everyday!  I did.  And if that doesn't convince you, I've lost 9.5 lbs by it (along with diet) in 4 months.  The absolute best buy for bellydance dvds out there.",1102291200,12,1163,4.275229357798165
2005608,2,B0001IN0C6,"Why did I buy this one? I keep asking myself that.

 Kathy Smith is a good exercise instructor-she is knowledgeable and motivational in that aspect-but she needs to stick with that-and stop doing the dance videos. I tried her Latin dance video a few years ago and it was awful...and now this.

 I have been bellydancing and performing with it for a few years,and I knew better-but I had to buy it. Save your money and don't.

 First of all-you can't teach a belly dance video if you can't belly dance yourself. The first thing I noticed was that Kathy can't keep a rhythm and you cannot properly execute most of the moves-so it was a bad idea to have her lead this video. The sets and costumes were gorgeous-but the background dancers should have been leading this one. I think since Ansuya (Of Bellydance Superstars) was in the background, and was the one who taught Kathy the dance moves-that Ansuya should have been the main instructor here, maybe with Kathy Smith ""assisting her"", rather than Kathy leading the video.

 Just to throw out a few examples of this-when Kathy was leading clockwise chest circles in the slow segment (lifting the chest up, to one side, down, then to the other side) she was letting her chest collapse to center between each move rather than holding it there. So, she was teaching a ""chest circle"" but she was not doing one. She was actually doing a ""chest lift, chest slide, chest drop, chest slide"" because she was collapsing her chest to center and not executing the movement properly.

 She also had trouble with basic belly dance moves such as the hip drop pattern where you drop forward, back, back, back...she was too inflexible in the hips so you ended up with forward, back, same, same. I understand that she is a beginner, and that she is not a belly dancer. This is my point. Kathy doesn't need to be a ""pro"" to teach these basic moves-but these are basic moves that in my area are taught in the first 10 weeks of beginning class. Kathy should have at least taken belly dance lessons for a few months from Ansuya before putting out this video-or at least long enough to master the moves she was teaching in this video.
 Her snake arms were stiff and lifeless and she let her arm form collapse on the downward motion of the arms every time.
 Belly dance is harder than it looks-and sometimes it takes a while to fully grasp these moves and to do them well-you can't take lessons for one month, and then put out a video.

 This was not even the worst part of the video, in my opinion. You cannot belly dance in your ""perky step aerobics instructor"" persona.
 I have NEVER seen a belly dancer perform and all of sudden squeal out ""OOOOOooooowwww!"" This is something that has annoyed me in Kathy Smiths fitness videos for years, but at least it is okay for an exercise instructor to be obnoxiously perky. (although I avoid exercise videos by instructors like this)
 This is ESPECIALLY out of place in belly dance, however. You wouldn't see a ballerina or a tap dancer shout out like that in the middle of a number, and I feel that Middle Eastern dance deserves the same respect.
 I found Kathy's overall attitude about belly dance appalling. Her ""woo-hoo!"" -ing and shouting...and yelling ""Yeah!"" ""OOOOoow!"" during the dance moves. It really felt to me like Kathy was in ""aerobics class"" persona, just wearing a fancy costume.

 During the fast portion of the workout, it is almost as if Kathy can't hear the music. She has no natural rhythm, and frequently gets off beat with the music. What I found funny about this, is that Ansuya and the other dancers refused to follow her and this point, and continued to dance WITH the rhythm and Kathy is left doing her own thing.

 The costumes and sets were gorgeous...but a her whooping wolf calls, bad dancing, and total lack of knowledge of belly dance in general can't be covered up with ""pretties"".

 There should also have been a brief rundown of proper posture in the beginning before starting and there was not. It only takes a minute to do this...and it is important to properly execute some of the moves.

 Other than the moves she learned from Ansuya, I would venture to say that Kathy doesn't know a doumbek from a zil...or a beledi from a karshlima. Trust me...you want someone who DOES.

 To sum it up...Kathy saw the popularity in the Veena/Neena and Rania bellydance videos-and decided to jump on the bandwagon to make a few bucks. The only problem is that belly dance is an actual art form and takes a lot of training to execute. She took a couple belly dance classes and then put out a video. Sheesh. Ansuya should have known better than to sign on with this...because I actually think less of her now for putting her name on this one.

 I understand completely that this is marketed as an ""exercise"" video, and is not a professional dance instructional. However, most belly dance exercise videos (such as those from Suhaila, Rania, Veena & Neena, etc.) are by women who have a lot of Middle Eastern dance experience-not by someone who just decided to ""make a video"" on it, but has no experience at all. To teach Middle Eastern dance in any form-a real dance video, or an exercise video-you should know how to do it yourself.",1098057600,168,5224,4.569131832797428
2005609,3,B0001IN0C6,"This video was just okay for me. I thought the instruction was good. It starts with 20 minutes of learning the basic moves, followed by 20 minutes of a faster routine using the moves you just learned, and ends with 10 minutes of stretching.

I got frustrated with this DVD because I just couldn't get my body to move right. I don't know if I'm just not flexible enough or what. Also, I couldn't get my heart rate up, even in the fast bellydance section, but maybe that's because I couldn't do the moves right. I was very disappointed because I usually enjoy dance-based aerobics, but this was not for me.",1097712000,9,604,4.441441441441442
2005610,5,B0001IN0C6,"This dvd does exactly what it's supposed to -- provides a good workout that isn't boring.  I can't imagine that it's a comprehensive overview of belly dancing, but as an off-day workout that isn't same-old, this is perfect.

It's excellent for those of us who aren't exactly in shape, because even the 'learn the moves' part felt like a workout to me -- so I can keep using this DVD indefinitely as I make progress.  And it does make you feel sexy and limber -- I had no idea I could shimmy!

I didn't find Kathy Smith to be at all wooden.  Honestly, if it had been led by the star belly dancer I would have been horribly intimidated.  That woman has no joints at all and a perfect stomach.

I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in belly dancing as exercise but who doesn't think they can do it.",1096502400,10,820,4.285714285714286
2005611,3,B0001IN0C6,"Kathy Smith should be ashamed of herself!!!!  She had a great dancer on the set who should have lead the video.  Well, I did pick up a few steps here and there.  I did not feel the urge to get up and dance until Ansuya did a little routine during the video.  It was simple but cute.  As for Kathy Smith, I own a lot of her aerobic videos and they are great...however, she ain't no dancer!!! She was offbeat, stiff, and...oh lord forgive me....she tried!!!!

This video is ok.  Oh...the costumes are nice!!!!",1095120000,11,507,4.329787234042553
2005612,3,B0001IN0C6,"I was looking at Bellydance videos, and this one came up, I read the reviews, and would have been a little put off, if I hadn't bought Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss: Pure Sweat, before reading the reviews. The reviews for that one were horrible, but I liked it, so I took a chance and bought this one.  I really enjoyed it.  The set is beautiful, and so are the costumes in the Heat It Up section.  It wasn't the best workout video I've ever done, but it was fun, and I worked up a decent sweat.
*EDIT*
I just wanted to add that I absolutely love the cool down.  You stretch out and just feel peaceful after.  Just follow the voice, and not Kathy on the screen, because they are sometimes out of sync.  I only rewind to the start of the cool down, so I can do it after other exercise tapes aswell.",1095033600,10,802,4.141935483870967
2005613,1,B0001IN0C6,"I love to workout with videos and this past year tried bellydance videos, which has become my new hobby. There are many bellydance videos available on Amazon.com and this is by far the worst. There are bellydance workout videos by the twins, instructional bellydance videos by Jillina and The Goddess Workout by DOlphina which is a little of both and I would highly recommend all of these! These videos are done by professional bellydancers that have danced their entire lives perfecting the art. Bellydance is a great workout, but it is so much more than that and not something you can learn in 2 days and instruct other people. Kathy Smith is stiff, unsexy and uninspiring and unmotivational. If this is the only video I saw, I would not be inspired to bellydance. Though she does have an ""expert"" on the set, Kathy is still the instructor and she doesn't have what it takes to teach this bellydance video. Try any other video, really!",1094601600,17,937,4.719512195121951

8013098,5,B0001IN0C6,"I got into belly dance in the year 2000.  During that time I danced with several troupes in semi-professional venues. That being said, I stopped dancing two years ago as a result of a knee injury. I had a knee replacement in July and felt ready to get back into it. I found this workout on youtube and enjoyed it immensely.  She has Ansuya-a Bellydance Superstar- in this video with her as well as several other dancers. So you know Kathy learned these moves from the best.  The second half of the dvd is taught in pods of 4 moves. I'm going to say that this is the only belly dance dvd I've done that actually gets the heart rate up.  Most dvds in this genre teach the moves in a very slow format and although it's good exercise it's not aerobic.  The moves here are explained very well.  If you haven't belly danced it will take a lot of drilling to get these moves down.  I would suggest repeating the tutorial over again as a drill each time you do it.  This is just the push I needed to get back into the dance I love so much.",1511308800,,1031,4.1457286432160805
8013099,5,B0001IN0C6,"I actually picked this DVD up at a thrift store not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable it was. My favorite thing about this workout vs. others is the flow. I have encountered several DVDs that put a lot of strain on the arms. This workout lacks that by keeping them moving or low. It more focuses on hip and leg work. The upbeat atmosphere is also nice too. Some of the other DVDs I have come across have a sort of awkward overly sexual vibe to them. This DVD feels like you just with some friends.

Kathy definitely is not a pro at this, but I did not find it distracting. She cues very well and doesn't spend too long or too little on each segment. The explanations of the moves are okay. I would not recommend using this to learn the moves, but it is great for practice for a beginner.",1510444800,,813,4.211538461538462

8013101,3,B0001IN0C6,"WOW!!! MEOW LADIES, careful, your claws are showing.  Oops! My claws are starting to come out, I have no control.  What is it with this workout dvd and the person doing it? With that said, here goes!  Unfortunately, I had already purchased this dvd BEFORE I read the reviews.  That is the equivalent of shutting the barn door after the  cows got out.  All I can say is thank you ladies for preparing me for what I was in store for. And, I can honestly say, not a one of you exaggerated in the slightest when commenting on her  belly dance performance and the affront to those of us forced to watch.  I am glad so many of yall had the presence of mind to give a detailed account because I am speechless.  I have not ever worked out to Kathy Smith and I was shocked at her inability to dance, stay in beat with the music, as well as she has no  rhythm!  Translation:  The women cannot dance!  Now, that is a new one, a work out instructor that cannot dance, has no sense of rhythm, and quite frankly, all I see when I watch her  is - well.......a GLAMOUR DON'T!  I realized  that this evening when I was watching her Latin Rhythm work out.  That brought it all home!  And, when she thanked a women who was an accomplished Latin dancer for working with her and helping her grasp the steps, (notice a pattern?) I thought are you serious?  And you are a cardio instructor?  Wow!  I mean, I know I am blessed with rhythm, catching on fast and dancing, but come one, Latin dancing is not hard and especially at the kindergarten level of difficulty in which we are being forced to contend with  cause she has to have private, tutoring and  is still a Glamour Don't!, I learned right then and there I would never get a challenging workout from her programs.  But, her Latin workout was much better then Denise Austin (first time trying her as well).  Her workout has more variety, raises heart rate more, and includes Latin dance.  Denise Austin's Latin dance workout did not include the Latin dance.!!  Seriously! But I digress and that is another review.

I did not get the same impression about Kathy Smith that some others got about the nerve of her being the front person on the Belly Dancing workout.  She made it very clear that she had difficulties and gave credit to the person who has been working with her.  I mean it is her fitness empire, so of course she should  be the front person.  But, I do not know if there was really any belly dance movements she did correctly.  Did anyone notice her facial expressions as she would try to do the shimmy or do a movement while traveling?  Priceless. Lets just say she has not mastered the poker face.  I could not believe after all of these years, she has not mastered the hip roll!! I better stop, me thinks I am being mean.  You know seriously, for all that has been said by me and others, look at how far she has come!  I mean she is rhythmically  challenged and has difficulty grasping the most basic of her job requirement which is dance. Yet, she has built a fitness empire from the ground up.  So, that is the equivalent of a na-na-na-na-na!  lol

In closing, back to the belly dance workout.  If you are interested in purchasing a belly dance workout dvd and are a newbie, then I do not see any reason why you would not enjoy this DVD and you should be able to workout with it for a while before you outgrow it.  The manner in which she executes teaching various movements and techniques, when all is said and done you will walk away with a good foundation.  And one thing is for sure, as you are learning all of these movements that are foreign to you, I do not think you will get frustrated with your progress from watching your instructor; technically yall will be learning the dance together. I am so bad!  I have lost control of what is typed, my hands and fingers have a mind and will of their own, cannot control my hands and fingers.  With that said, if you are considering purchasing this workout DVD and, like me, have some belly dance experience, then DO NOT purchase this workout as it will be the equivalent of taking the money it cost and flicking the bic and burning the money.  Seriously, there is no value and absolutely nothing to be gained except buyers remorse and a workout DVD you will end of giving away to your sister or your best friend. You have already surpassed this level of difficulty required.",1464048000,,4378,4.368029739776952

8013103,1,B0001IN0C6,"If this program was for fitness using Belly dancing or if the main focus was/is instruction, then this program failed in both areas. I've practiced Belly dancing and this program went nowhere for me. It was not easy or simple to follow. Kathy seemed like she had just left training and was anxious to go and teach an art she wasn't even good at. I'm not that fantastic either so when I put a program like this on for fitness or training, I want the instructor to be better than I am. I've tried others like: Belly Dancing With Atea And Friends, Hula Dancing, Verna & Neena Present: Belly Dance Fitness For Beginners, and Belly Dance Fitness For Weight Loss. Plus for Instruction, I've tried: Instructional BellyDance With Jillina. Any of the programs I've just mentioned are better than ""Flex Appeal"". In all fairness, I really like Kathy Smith. I bought one of her earlier aerobics programs, that I really liked. I credit her in helping me with my Ab Fitness when I was first using video's for fitness. Most programs, whether they benefit me or not, bore me. WHY!? Because I don't like to eLIBRARY. Kathy was brave to have done this one. I could not get into it. I probably used it about three to six times before I gave up. If you're a hardcore Kathy Smith fan and just have to have every program she's put out, whether or not you like then okay. But if not, then skip this one. HERE'S AN IDEA: TRY TO GET A COPY FROM THE LIBRARY. If you like, buy it. If you don't you will not have wasted a penny.",1437523200,,1500,4.360714285714286

I was surprised.  Although there have been several complaints about Kathy's ""bad form"" and ppl posting urging exercisers to watch the professional dancers in the back row instead of trying to follow Kathy, I think a good purpose is served by contrasting both levels of expertise with this dance form.

First off, Kathy does her usual good job of cueing which is something professional bellydancers don't necessarily do from a fitness workout perspective.  Second, Kathy's form illustrates enthusiastic beginner level which can be good for those easily intimidated, while the professionals illustrate a desirable level to shoot for.  While the professionals look lovely, of course, some home exercisers would be put off and discouraged from ever trying this dance form if professionals were all that they saw.  Third, the purpose of this workout is to workout, not to spend so much time on technique that we are training to become professional bellydancers.

I was happy with the organization of the workout chapters, the lovely set and costumes and the music.  As far as bellydance workouts for fitness I can also recommend Rania's dvds as well as Sharqui, all available here on Amazon.",1396483200,,1356,5.104072398190045
