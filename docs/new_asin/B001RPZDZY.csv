8338607,5,B001RPZDZY,"A delightful production, made even more enjoyable if one is well acquainted with the Mozart/Da Ponte dramma giocoso version.  This is true opera buffa.",1504310400,,151,5.291666666666667
8338608,5,B001RPZDZY,"I give this 5 stars, not because it  equals Mozart's Don Giovanni, and it shouldn't. Comparisons are odious as we know. However, there is much delicious  writing here and it is impossible to exhaust the musical beauty latent in the theme. Witness all the other Don Giovannis that have since, and will be continued to be composed, in the future without or without  vocal components. What this music also tells us is that Giuseppe Gazzaniga is a composer to be reckoned with. I was induced to listen and to buy other works by him to my great joy in their splendor. As an aside, there may have been earlier treatments of Don Juan before the Baroque, by composers that I do not know or do not readily come to mind.",1408233600,2,710,4.446153846153846
