I would put this up there with ""Duck Soup"" as one of the all-time anti-war comedies. The Nazis are portrayed as morons and idiots. Mild violence and a few bad Nazis get shot but nothing otherwise objectionable. The seller rated it ""like new"" and it was in almost perfect condition.

364661,5,630170648X,"This film came highly recommended to me by a gentleman with whom I struck up a conversation while waiting for a MetroBus in Washington, D.C.  I am a fan of Robert Stack.  I have read his autobiography.  He mentions the film, particularly his nervousness at playing opposite Carole Lombard.  Robert Stack was 23 or so when he made this movie.  Ten years before, at the age of 13, he had a towering crush on Carole Lombard, who was a family friend and visited the Stack home.  In his autobiography, he has several photographs taken of him and Carole Lombard clowning around on the set of this film -- her way of loosening him up and getting him over his nervousness.

The plot involves a theatre group in Warsaw in 1939.  The Germans have just marched in, and there is a resistance movement.  Jack Benny, of all people, plays the star of the theater group.  He has an actor's ego, but not much talent -- until he must impersonate a university professor who is a spy for the Germans, and a German High Command officer, in order to prevent disaster for Polish citizens.  Carole Lombard plays Benny's wife, in an unlikely pairing that actually works.  Stack is a Polish air forces lieutenant who, upon the German invasion, flees with other Polish pilots to England, there to carry on the fight for their homeland as adjuncts to the Royal Air Force.  He also is infatuated with Carole Lombard (art imitating life?), professing his love for her behind her husband's back.

When the Polish airmen discover that the professor, ostensibly supporting them, is in reality a Nazi spy, Stack must parachute into Poland to carry the news and attempt to contact the underground resistance movement, so they can stop the professor from carrying damaging information to the Gestapo.

The story goes from humor to stark drama in short and startling order -- but it works.",1377129600,,1852,4.708074534161491
364662,5,630170648X,"The original from 1942. Complements Mel Brooks' later version and fun to see the scene and similar dialogue throughout. The Brooks' version is a musical, this original is not and some of the plot devices and names have been re-aligned or re-assigned. Very enjoyable and to this point rare to find. New Criterion version, albeit somewhat expensive, will make this gem more available. Jack Benny is excellent as are all the characters.",1374278400,,433,5.027777777777778
364663,4,630170648X,You don't see jack Benny movies very often.  He was in many ways what he was on TV but the story was fun and very well written.  Carole Lombard's last film demonstrates why she was so good.  Definitely worthwhile.  Mel Brooks did a parody of this in 1983 I believe.  See this first if you are going to be seeing that.,1373932800,,317,4.131147540983607
364664,4,630170648X,"Lubitsch throws logic and caution to the wind in this mad-cap about actors thwarting the Gestapo and the Nazis in 1942 Warsaw.  Jack Benny (who I never had much time for) is perfectly cast as the actor who rises to the occasion; Lombard was never lovelier and rarely funnier; and Robert Stack (one of the great underrated actors) didn't get to do anything this funny again until Airplane -- almost forty years later.

It's lots of goofy-action, making fun of the Nazis, some nice set pieces (the irony of having a spy hunted by poles dressed as Nazis), some dark humor (Benny puts the local Gestapo chief on the spot when he names what he claims are Nazi agents, only to discover they have been inadvertently shot), and a screw-ball romance threading it all together.

But the danger with satire -- even satire this clever -- is that real life can quickly eclipse it.  This, unfortunately, is exactly what happened to ""To Be Or Not To Be"":

In 1943 the Nazi's crushed the ghetto uprising, capturing or killing more than 50,000 Jews.  In 1944, while the Red Army watched from across the river, another 150,000-200,000 Poles were killed in the Warsaw uprising.  And our last view of Lombard is in a plane -- she died in a plane-crash before the film was even released.

So as great as it might be, ""To Be Or Not To Be"" is a movie I can't enjoy.",1372377600,,1342,4.493827160493828
364695,5,630170648X,"I am a fanatical fan of Carole Lombard. I've watch almost all of her films, and been up to the crash site of TWA #3 in Nevada. I read books about her, and studied her life deeply. She was more than an actress, but an artist, and a human-being with interest in the people and country around her. From an era when film acting was still an art without special effects.  Carole Lombard finished filming ""To Be or Not To Be"" in December of 1941 but sadly was killed in a plane crash in January of 1942 while returning home on TWA Flight #3 after doing a war bond tour to raise money for our military now involved in WWII. She was declared the first female casualty of WWII by President FDR himself.  ""To Be or Not To Be"" is a five star film. The comical yet serious acting is wonderful. Jack Benny was spot on, and a newbie known as Robert Stack (later known as host of ""Unsolved Mysteries"") was fabulous . Carole Lombard plays this film beautifully. Although her part is smaller than her previous roles and is her second film back into comical roles (the pervious being ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" from 1941) after a short run at dramatic roles, she once again steals the show. This film was released in March of 1942 but because of Lombard's death, and our occupation in WWII, it fizzled at the box office but would gain cult status and become known as one of the best films of the 1940s in later decades.  This movie is in many ways a precurusr to ""Hogan's Heroes"" and has that same comical stab, and profiling ""lets make fun of Nazi Germany"" during WWII. In fact some of the German characters like ""Capt Schultz"" from the 1960s show ""Hogan's Heroes"" seem to be ripped off straight from ""To Be or Not To Be"" (1942) with ""Cap Shultz"" having the same name and personna in both ""To Be or Not To Be"" (1942) and ""Hogan's Heroes"" (1965-1971). I would recommend this film, and give this film five out of five stars. Carole Lombard fans of ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936) and ""True Confessions"" (1937) will love this film as those fans of ""Hogan's Heroes"". I also highly recommend the 1983 Mel Brooks remake of ""To Be or Not To Be"" and is one of the few times I can say the remake is just as good or equal to the original. However I would be warry of high priced DVD sales of this film, and would pay no more than $12.00 for a new DVD copy.",1368057600,,2315,4.256818181818182
364696,5,630170648X,"Much more than 33 words are required to treat this curious film properly. As WW2 anti-Nazi propaganda it's rather a masterpiece. Jack Benny, says me, gives his greatest film performance. The film is important.",1365206400,,209,5.176470588235294

This movie was made in 1942 when the War was on.

We knew that the Germans had concentration camps, but we had no idea what was going on in them.

Jack Benny is in his prime.

It's hard to believe that the lovely Carole Lombard died in a plane crash, a few months later. She was married to Clark Gable. It must have been terribly sad. If you get a chance watch her dance with George Raft on YouTube.

Robert Stack is also in this movie. Amazingly, he looks the same in 1942 as he did in 1982. He never aged.

Lubitsch's insight into human behavior is amazing.",1351209600,,365,5.1
364767,4,630170648X,"Carole Lombard plays Maria Tura, a well-known actress in Warsaw in 1939. Jack Benny plays her husband, Joseph Tura. The only other actor you are likely to recognize is a very young Robert Stack playing Lt. Stanislaw Sobinski of the Polish Air Force.

When the Nazis invaded, the Turas' acting troupe was putting together a satire of Hitler, which was obviously canceled in view of the circumstances. So there they are with all those perfectly good Nazi uniforms, and an opportunity to create a very complicated mayhem.

Lt. Sobinski, who had a terrible crush on Maria, was evacuated to England when the Nazis arrived, and was part of a squadron of Polish pilots who worked with the RAF. One day they were visited by a famous professor who was heading back to Warsaw on what he hinted was a secret mission, and the pilots naively gave him their relatives' and friends' addresses to ""take messages to them."" However, Sobinski grows suspicious when the professor does not recognize Maria Tura's name, given that she is so very famous in Warsaw. He goes to English intelligence and . . . but I don't want to spoil all the fun.

There are false costumes and beards and mustaches, make-up and all the disguise effects you'd expect from an acting troupe, put to work for the Polish resistance. It's a serious enough story, but told with quite a few laughs. Jack Benny wouldn't know how else to do it.",1336694400,,1393,4.677551020408163
364768,5,630170648X,A movie about Hitler invading Poland shouldn't be this funny but Jack Benny and Carol Lombard make this both a comedy classic as well as showing what war was like in Europe.

364769,5,630170648X,"This movie, like another 1942 release ""Casablanca,"" demonstrates the courage of the filmmakers.

The portrayal of Hitler, both the true and the false one, is quite convincing and the make-up artist is to be commended for the likeness that he created.
Jack Benny and Carole Lombard shine as the Polish Shakespearian actor and his attractive wife and almost like the conclusion to the Second World War, the story has a happy ending! A young Robert Stack as an exiled Polish officer adds interest.

364825,5,630170648X,"A brilliant, darkly funny film, Ernst Lubitsch's comedy about a Polish theatre troop and its efforts to thwart the Nazis was not well received in its day. The film was released in 1942, and a public in the midst of World War II may not have been in the mood to watch a film that made fun of what was, at the time, a real threat.

While its initial reception was unfortunate, the film has since been rightly recognized as a classic. 1942 audiences apparently felt that much of the humor was in bad taste. You could argue, however, that trying to be tasteful would have been the wrong approach. Nothing about the Nazis or what they did could be considered good taste. And Lubitsch's humor was grounded in a genuine recognition of the seriousness of the Nazi threat. He mocks the banality of the Nazis, but he never forgets that they are, in fact, genuinely dangerous. The theatre troop (led by Carol Lombard and Jack Benny, both wonderful here) and its antics are farcical and often hilarious, but the filmmakers never forget the real danger that they're in. ""To Be or Not to Be"" is a fabulous piece of work.",1310169600,,1106,4.502487562189055
364826,5,630170648X,"""To Be Or Not To Be"" is a one of a small group of anti-Nazi films that came out prior to the U.S. entry into WW 2. Most of these films were serious films  - e.g., ""Confessions of a Nazi Spy"" (1939), ""All Through the Night"" (1941), ""Night Train to Munich"" (1940) , ""The Mortal Storm"" (1940), ""49th Parallel"" (1941), ""Waterloo Bridge"" (1940), and ""A Yank in the RAF"" (1941) - but two were comedies: this one and Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" (1940). And if I can be forgiven for the sin, I think this one was the best.

The film stars Jack Benny and Carol Lombard as Polish actors who get involved in political intrigue when the Nazis invade Poland.

Jack Benny (1894-1974) was one of the funniest comedians who conquered vaudeville, radio, film, and TV. His film career was the least of his considerable achievements with only a handful of memorable films, the best of which were this film and ""The Horn Blows at Midnight"" (1945).

Carole Lombard (1908-1942) was one of the best comediennes of the mid 20th century, her talented life cut short at 33 during a USO tour. She appeared in ""Twentieth Century"" (1934), ""Bolero"" (1934)and ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936) for which she received an Oscar nomination. She was the Queen of screwball comedies. This was her last film and she died before it was released.

FWIW - Lombard's husband Clark Gable urged her not to make this film, but she did, and afterwards said it was the happiest experience of her movie life.

Handsome Robert Stack (1919-2003) plays a Polish bombardier who is infatuated with Lombard. He is best known from his Emmy winning performance in the TV series ""The Untouchables"" (1959-63), but he made dozens of films including ""The Mortal Storm"" (1940) which was one of the best pre war anti-Nazi films. Shortly after he made this film Stack enlisted in the Navy. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""Written on the Wind"" (1957).

FWIW - Stack played dramatic, some might say melodramatic roles for most of his life, then with ""Airplane"" (1980) he moved into comedy, but you can see the roots of his considerable comedic skills in this film.

In addition to Benny, Lombard, and Stack, the cast includes Lionel Atwill, Charles Halton, and Sig Ruman.

Lionel Atwill (1885-1946) was the king of the B horror films and best remembered as Inspector Krogh, the man with the wooden arm, who hunts down the monster in ""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939) while managing to get in a game of darts with Basil Rathbone.  Atwill appeared in 5 of the 8 Universal Frankenstein films, and also had time for ""Mark of the Vampire"" (1935) and ""House of Dracula"" (1945) as well as several Sherlock Holmes films, the best of which was ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" (1939). He plays a pompous actor.

Charles Halton (1878-1959) almost always played a weasly character that fit his small frame and sharp features. He appeared in more than 150 films between 1917 and 1958, often in comedies like ""The Shop Around the Corner"" (1940), but he could also play the villain.

Fat and funny Sig Ruman (1884-1967) was everyone's favorite German, best known as Sgt. Schulz from ""Stalag 17"" (1953) and opera owner Hermann Gottlieb in ""A Night at the Opera"" (1935). He plays a German Colonel in charge of Warsaw.

Ernst Lubitsch (1892-1947) directs. He began his career in the silent era. He was nominated for an Oscar 3 times, including ""Heaven can Wait"" (1943). Lubitsch was a master of comedy, and a favorite of directors like Billy Wilder and William Wyler. He liked to say ""Nobody should try to play comedy unless they have a circus going on inside.""

Cinematographer Rudolph Mate (1898-1964) was Oscar nominated 5 years in a row, from 1940 (""Foreign Correspondent"") to 1944 (""Cover Girl""). He turned to directing in 1947 and made films like ""Union Station"" (1950), ""When Worlds Collide"" (1951), and ""The 300 Spartans"" (1962).

The film was not well received when released. Benny's own father walked off when he saw his son wearing a Nazi uniform.

This is one of the funniest films of all time, and made even more important due to its poignancy. The acting is terrific, the dialogue is hysterical, and the sight gags are funny even more than a half century later. Don't even bother with Mel Brook's remake.",1309910400,,4227,4.7306122448979595
364827,4,630170648X,"O.K.- Bad taste aside, this is one funny movie. Actually, it can get rather preachy, but this is hindsight talking. One wonders what in heavens name they were thinking when they came up with the idea! But to see Jack Benny go at it, that's the payoff. And the ending, when the fellow starts to get up and leave, and to watch Benny's face!",1301961600,,338,4.296875
364828,5,630170648X,"Ernst Lubitsch was one of the most talented and daring filmmakers of his generation. Accustomed to make provocative and fearless scripts, he achieved a honor place with this acidic and laughable comedy against the Nazis; specially when just two years ago Charles Chaplin had throwen his hat top ring with The Great Dictator and perhaps for many everything had been said aboiut this awful issue. Tha's why when Lubitsch assumed the task of directing the 1942 political satire classic To Be or Not to Be, the normal expectations turned around what was going on behind stage and the surprise was majuscule for crictics and audiences; the film  marked the final screen appearance of comedienne Carole Lombard. In Warsaw at the beginning of WWII, Maria Tura (Lombard) and husband Joseph (Jack Benny) perform anti-Nazi plays with their theater troupe until they are forced to switch to Shakespeare's Hamlet. Lt. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack) falls for Maria and meets up with her during Joseph's famous ""To Be or Not to Be"" speech as Hamlet. When Stanislav is eventually dispatched for war, he implicates Maria with Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), who has a secret plan to destroy the Warsaw resistance. The Polish theater troupe is then forced to use their theatrical skills to ensure their survival. Eventually, they turn to impersonating Nazi officers -- and even Hitler himself -- in order to outwit the enemy and keep the resistance safe from spies. To Be or Not to Be opened to a controversial release in 1942, when the U.S. was still very much involved in WWII.

364833,5,630170648X,"To Be or Not To Be is an outstanding black comedy that works on every level; I have rarely watched a film with this much humor and action combined. The script was very well written and the casting couldn't have been better. If poor Carole Lombard had to go out of this world after making a film, at least she went out after making this; she recalled that it was the best experience she had as a screen star. The cinematography and the choreography shine and the acting is very convincing as well. If I sound like I'm gushing about this it's because I was thrilled with this picture and it will remain in my collection for years to come. My only quibble is that at certain points the quality of the print could have been a bit better; but this is minor and the sound is excellent.

When the action starts, we see a Polish local theater company preparing for their opening night of a play critical of Hitler and Nazism. Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) and his wife Maria (Carole Lombard) star in the show; but we meet other actors in the troop including Bronski who is playing Hitler; Greenberg who complains that he's only cast as an extra; producer Dobosh (Charles Halton) and more. However, at the last minute a government minister comes to tell them that they cannot put on the play because it might offend Hitler--so they hastily prepare for Hamlet with Joseph playing the role of Hamlet.

Unfortunately, there's even more trouble than the impending Nazi invasion of Poland. Maria, Joseph's wife, Maria, has been getting flowers from an admirer who turns out to be Polish Lieut. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack). Moreover, a trusted and esteemed Polish professor by the name of Siletsky goes on a secret mission for Poland and gets the names of the families who are in the Polish resistance movement--only it turns out that Siletsky is actually working for the Nazis as a spy and he wants to turn over the names of the resistance fighters and their families to the Gestapo.

I don't want to spoil too much of this for you; suffice it to say that there are many quick plot twists that make for a whopper of a movie with action, suspense and some really good laughs. Look also for a great performance by Sig Ruman as Nazi Captain Ehrhardt; In addition, the DVD comes with two extras; we get ""The Rounder"" and ""Buy Savings Bonds! A Patriotic Drama.""

To Be or Not To Be rightfully deserves its place as one of the funniest films ever according to The American Film Institute. I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys black comedy; and fans of the actors in this film will love it.",1258502400,,2584,4.53862660944206
364834,4,630170648X,"A decent little film shot in 1942. Could we say it was shot dead? Or is that too Jewish a piece of humor? The plot is absurd and that is why it is funny, but not a deep intellectual funny, nor a deep artistic and esthetic  funny, nor even a deep emotional funny. Just funny for war time, funny for when everyone is crying, weeping or plain dying. We think of the other Jewish actor who did a similar impersonation of Hitler, Charlie Chaplin. But Charlie Chaplin played the real Hitler, whereas here it is always a false Hitler, tricking the real one in his back. That is funny for sure but that is also kind of vain, except if you take it is as a plain entertainment for an audience that wants to laugh at their arch enemy. So they play the Mickey out of him. But what's left after sixty or more years? Not much except the scene about ""to be or not to be"", played three times on a stage in the context of Hamlet in the film. The force of this sequence is in the fact that an actor plays Hamlet in front of an audience and a member of that audience stands up and walks out on him when he says that sentence, and the scene is of course in front of another audience, us. The second level of that distantiation is what makes it funny because we can see the varying surprise and anger of the actor who takes it as an insult before he learns it was coded language. And it is true Ehrard has it right when he says that what this Tura actor did to Shakespeare, they, the Nazis, are doing it to Poland. But then the third time, and that is only true for us, though also for one person in the audience in the theater in the film, it becomes absurd because there is no explanation for that total stranger to stand up and walk out.  But apart from that the film has aged tremendously and even the acting has aged and seems so unnatural, though we can accept that from most of the main actors who are supposed to be actors and hence to play a role, even in real life. The only important thing is that in 1942 the film is heavily speaking of concentration camps. If Lubitsch knew about it, why didn't the allies know about it and why didn't they do something to stop the massacre? At least they had no excuse and they cannot pretend they were less informed than Lubitsch. That's the only interesting point of that film still today.

Boy am I glad I finally caught this.  This film provides a rare window on the early days of the war, as seen by a Western Europe equally perplexed and disgusted by the rise of Nazism.  In the hands of a brilliant director, and a motivated cast, this film transcends its moment and enters the realm of high art.

I could go on about the sets, the intricate comic plot that grows increasingly absurd, the luminous Carol Lombard and her amazing gowns, the always funny Jack Benny hamming it and serving as the butt of many jokes, the great character actors populating the cast as real and fake Nazis, or even an early fine performance by Robert Stack, but I'll simply urge you to see this film and see for yourself.

364878,5,630170648X,"I won't add my unqualified praise to the long list of enthusiastic reviews, with which I heartily agree.

The other day I saw a documentary about ""Gentleman's Agreement,"" which mentioned that it was the first Hollywood film to use the word ""Jew,"" which had supposedly been taboo because the studio heads did not want to call attention to their own ethnicity.

Actually, Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" had dealt openly with the plight of Jews, in Germany, long before ""Gentleman's Agreement.""

But ""To Be Or Not to Be"" scrupulously avoids any reference to Jews, even though the characters in the story are obviously a company of Jewish actors, and director Lubitsch and many of the actors in the film are themselves Jewish.

As if to underline the taboo, or perhaps to poke a little satirical bite at it, early on the script has Jack Benny, in a throw-away line that one could easily miss, nonchalantly order a ""salami and cheese sandwich"" -- a no-no in the diet of a traditional Eastern European Jew.

The film even goes so far as to misquote Shakespeare, having Felix Bressart substitute the words ""I"" and ""we"" for ""Jew"" in Shylock's most famous speech. This shameless (or shameful, depending upon how you look at it) bowlerism could not have been overlooked by the more literate of those in the audience.

Those same people may also have wondered at the choice of Hamlet's onstage ""To Be Or Not to Be"" speech as an opportune time for the Carol Lombard character to pursue a backstage assignation.

Lombard's Maria Tura would surely have played Ophelia in the production. Immediately following the ""To Be or Not to Be"" scene, Hamlet comes upon Ophelia saying her prayers. There could not possibly have been time during the speech for Maria to have an offstage romance and still make her entrance on cue.

These anomalies in the story are perhaps a wink at the audience, and no more improbable than a troupe of Jewish actors in Poland successfully impersonating Nazi soldiers, a general, and even Hitler.

The film is both a social statement, albeit an obvious one, and a brilliant farce, and is one of my all-time favorites.",1225065600,,2125,4.8
364879,5,630170648X,"I don't like to throw around superlatives, for the most part.  But I really think that this is the funniest film that I have ever seen.  The humor is a combination of farce/screwball, satire, black and a some slapstick to boot.  But what makes it really stand out is the directing, Lubitsch is simply brilliant.  The cuts are just right, the timing of the scenes and the pacing of the film overall keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  In a sense, the film feels like one extended dance (think of early Lubitsch).  The acting is also top notch.  Weeks after watching the film I still laugh when thinking back about it.

But underneath the extremely funny surface are some serious issues.  It is about WWII after all.  There's the issue of the Jews and their response to the Germans.  The Jewish identity of most of the characters is supposedly hidden but the hiding act isn't all that convincing.

Lubitsch once said that the film was about actors being actors until the bitter end.  I guess people in ""the biz"" could relate to that better than I could.

364882,5,630170648X,"This brilliant farce, completed just as America entered the war due to Pearl Harbour, was as controversial as it was clever. Ernst Lubitsch, like Charlie Chaplin a few years earlier with ""The Great Dictator"", dared to set a comedy around the Nazis. Like Chaplin's film, it opened to mix reviews, offending both critics and the public and was not a great success.

Given that premise, this is a brilliantly scripted and directed comedy set in Warsaw at the outbreak of the war. An acting troupe outwit the Nazis's plan to destroy the underground. The plot is outrageous and hilarious. Jack Benny plays the leading actor and it is no co-incidence that he wishes to play Hamlet because he is a ham himself. Benny is beautifully paired with the gorgeous Carole Lombard as his flirtatious wife. This was Lombard's last film before she tragically died in an air crash. She was at the height of her powers. There are many great supporting actors but Sig Rumann as Concentration Camp Erhart is a standout. Surely he was the basis for the Colonel in Hogan's Heroes. The film was successfully remade as a musical comedy by Mel Brooks many years later but this version is the best.

The print of the film is OK and the DVD contains 2 short films starring Benny; the first, made in 1930 stars him as a conventional comedic leading man and is mildly amusing and the second is war time propaganda. The DVD is OK value but better if purchased as part of the Comedy Classics set.",1206230400,,1463,4.623076923076923
364883,4,630170648X,"In the midst of World War II, before the Americans had entered into the fray, Ernst Lubitsch made what appears on the face of it an oxymoron: a light-hearted comedy about the Polish Resistance to the Nazis.  (The film was released just after Pearl Harbor, but had been in the works while the United States continued to stand on the sidelines.)  Of course, while it does end up being quite funny, the film has a much more serious subtext -- about the responsibilities of Hollywood (and of the United States) in the face of the increasing dangers faced by countries across Europe.

An acting troupe in Warsaw prior to the Polish invasion is planning a production to expose the dangers of Nazism, when they are shut down for fear of angering the Germans.  Their practice in portraying Nazis, however, becomes extremely valuable when they are needed to keep information regarding the Polish resistance out of the hands of the Gestapo.  The story is very clever, and played with panache by a delightful cast of characters lead by Carole Lombard and Jack Benny.

What makes the film especially interesting, apart from being a fine Lubitsch comedy, is the film's message to the audience and to other filmmakers about the responsibilities and limitations of the artist during wartime.  The director of the Polish acting troupe  wants them to make a serious play about Nazis; the actors want to make it into a comedy.  Still, their actions proceed from a false perception of their safety -- it is easy to criticize the enemy when he is not at the gates.  As I take it, the message of the film is that artists (both actors and filmmakers) should not be afraid to use their unique talents in the service of war, and should not be afraid to risk their lives and repuations, and that their power and potential should not be underestimated.  A further message seems to be that humor and satire can be more effective than serious propaganda.

A troupe of actors in Nazi-occupied Warsaw must get by on their ability as thespians to elaborately (and effectively) disguise themselves, as well as adapt new identities, in order to fool the occupying troops.

364950,5,630170648X,"TO BE OR NOT TO BE paired legendary director Ernst Lubitsch with the insanely-talented comedienne Carole Lombard (in what turned out to be her final film).  Written and released during the height of WW2, the film provided a much-needed breath of fresh air for wartime audiences whilst mercilessly skewering the Nazi regime.

In Nazi-occupied Poland, theatre supercouple Joseph and Maria Tura (Jack Benny and Carole Lombard) wow the crowds with their repertory production of ""Hamlet""--and moonlight as members of the Polish Resistance.  Based on a story from Melchoir Lengyel (""Ninotchka""), the laughs fly thick and fast, with Jack Benny in his element as the most hammy Hamlet that ever was; and Carole Lombard is at her sexiest as Tura's glamourpuss wife.  The strong ensemble cast includes Robert Stack, Felix Bressart, Lionel Atwill, Sig Ruman, Maude Eburne and Tom Dugan.

Fans of Carole Lombard are the ones who have always appreciated this gem more than most, because it was her last film appearance.  In 1942, while returing home from a warbonds drive, Carole and her mother were both killed after their plane crashed outside of Las Vegas.  TO BE OR NOT TO BE was kept on the shelf until a suitable period of mourning had elapsed.  It was later re-made in 1983 by Mel Brooks as a co-starring vehicle for Brooks and his wife Anne Bancroft.

Still as fresh today as it was over 50 years ago, TO BE OR NOT TO BE remains one of Hollywood's classiest classic comedies.  (Single-sided, dual-layer disc).",1185753600,,1504,4.932539682539683

""To be or not to be..."" with that famous bland look on his face.  Maybe it's having grown up with listening to him on the radio and then watching him on TV, that I so much enjoyed him here.

But after thinking a bit about the movie, I moved from being merely amused to being quite amazed at how this movie was so able to portray truly horrific events in a comedic way, during the time of the actual war.

We've seen a lot of movies that show the misery of war.  We've seen some that managed to make former wars funny (MASH comes to mind, which showed the Korean War, while we were in Viet Nam). I can't think of any that managed to pull off comedy while everyone who was making it and watching it was still at risk,, with the possible exception of Stalag 17..and I'm not sure when that came out.  Can you imagine a comedy featuring Osama ben Laden or Saddam Hussein or whoever our current enemy is supposed to be?  Maybe if we laughed at our enemies more we'd disarm them....

Great plans, suggested sexual innuendo in the perfect European way with lots of (not obvious) puns, a quality of photography that makes the light around the actors shine like a halo, integrating Shakespeare's texts in the plot of the 1939 invasion of Poland is a coup de maitre! The movie was made during the war itself and as such, is a strong denunciation of the enemy, probably stronger than the more ""in-your-face/full-of-blood"" classic war movies. Lubitsch must have been a great optimist and even his earlier and rarely seen or acknowledged ""Broken Lullaby"" (about World War 1), which is maybe his only ""tragedy"" movie, keeps the hope alive.

364955,5,630170648X,"There is a certain sense of melancholy I feel when I watch this 1942 classic Ernst Lubitsch movie, as it represents the last appearance of the luminous Carole Lombard, surely the most breathtaking and high-spirited of actresses during Hollywood's golden era. In a rush to get home to husband Clark Gable after a successful war bond tour, she died in a plane crash during the film's post-production, and as the result proves without a doubt, the world lost one of the great treasures of the silver screen. She and co-star Jack Benny play Maria and Joseph Tura, the egocentric stars of a Polish acting troupe who are caught in the 1939 Nazi invasion of Warsaw. As a world-class flirt, she is carrying on with a handsome young pilot named Stanislav Sobinski, and their trysts begin once he hears his cue to get up from his theater seat, Hamlet's famous opening line to his soliloquy as spoken by an increasingly perturbed Joseph.

The romantic triangle quickly takes a backseat to an espionage thriller involving a German spy named Professor Siletsky, who holds the names of members of the Polish underground. His intention is to kill them, but the acting troupe, now with their theater in ruins, band together to stop him. This includes the need for the extremely vainglorious Joseph to impersonate Siletsky in front of the befuddled Colonel Ehrhardt and for Maria to seduce any Nazi official who stands in their way. While it sounds like a piece of wartime propaganda, the film actually becomes more farcical even as people are getting killed.

As Joseph, Benny has never been better, conveying both self-absorption and cunning expertly, and the script by  Edwin Justus Mayer and an uncredited Lubitsch gives him a number of great one-liners. With her honey-toned voice and smoky elegance, Lombard is at the top of her game as the seductive Maria, as she dexterously shows her comic and dramatic sides with precision and unparalleled style. Delivering her lines with subtle finesse, she provides a strong match for Benny. Sixty-four years later, and there is still no one who can touch her. The rest of the ensemble is memorable starting with Sig Ruman's hilarious turn as Ehrhardt. A fresh-faced Robert Stack, all of 22, plays Sobinski with a callow, zestful energy, while Felix Bressart excels as the ultimately heroic Greenberg.

The movie makes direct commentaries on the concentration camps, and the satirical aspects are blissfully unapologetic. The stylishness of the comedy in light of the virulent wartime setting is what makes the film memorable and it proves what a master Lubitsch was at this level of subtlety. The 2005 DVD comes with two extras both featuring Benny - an ancient twenty-minute comedy short from 1930 called ""The Rounder"" and a brief commercial for war bonds.

Determined to alter the course of the war, the two helm a troupe of ham actors in a dead pan comic assault on the Nazis When a spy emerges who has damaging information to the Polish resistance, Joseph and Maria decide to prevent the information from being delivered to the Reich. Benny's brilliant lampoon of Hamlet's soliloquy ""to be or not to be"" is at the crux of a disastrous rendezvous between Maria and Lt. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack). Stan gets the hots for Maria - a passion not reciprocated. Hence, when Stan is dispatched for war, he cruelly implicates Maria with Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), the real spy who has a secret plan to destroy the Warsaw resistance. The theater troupe is then forced to use their thespian skills to ensure their own survival; impersonating Nazi officers and even Hitler in order to outwit the enemy. Controversial to say the very least, ""To Be Or Not to Be"" opened to modest acclaim and was later remade, to limited effect, as a 1983 farce starring Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft.

Warner's DVD treatment is middle of the road. The black and white image has been mastered from reasonably clean film elements. Contrast levels are adequate, though at times weak. There's a hint of edge enhancement and some fine detail shimmering, but nothing that will distract. Fine details are sometimes nicely realized but darker scenes suffer from inconsistent quality. Film grain is moderate. Age related artifacts are present throughout. An archival news reel and short subject are the only extras included.",1109030400,,1824,4.922077922077922
365003,5,630170648X,"You know very little about Jack Benny?  Don't matter.  This film has no right to be this funny.  No film that deals with Nazis and death has any reason to be this hilarious.  And yet, Benny and director Ernst Lubitsch found the perfect balance between wittiness  and suspense.  The scene near the end where Benny is put in a room with the body of the man he is impersonating?  Genius.  I actually had been laughing ten seconds early and then my chest tightened up.  Great film with classic lines, terrific acting and genuine charm.",1106784000,,531,4.5638297872340425
365004,5,630170648X,"A witty and entertaining comedy that sophisticatedly satirizes Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. Filmed early during World War II, the movie was probably several generations before its time. It was bold enough to focus on and belittle the Nazi Party when they possessed considerable power and their ultimate role in history was as of yet undefined.  Fascism is attacked throughout by exaggerating its flawed logic into comedic situations. Great cast including Jack Benny, Carole Lomard, Robert Stack, Lionel Atwill and Tom Dugan among others. Jack Benny's facial expressions alone are worth watching this great film.",1104105600,,615,5.40625
365005,5,630170648X,"I've had this on VHS for years and it is one of the greatest satires and sophisticated comedies. Both Jack Benny and Carol Lombard give two of the pen-ultimate comic turns on film.

Comparing this to Bergnini's tasteless wallow in phoney sentiment (and distorted history) is an insult to the genius of Lubitsch.

If this comes out on DVD, I hope it is loaded with extras on the making and controvesy surrounding this film. I find this preferable to Chaplin's  ""The Great Dictator. Much easier going down and more of the real courage it took to stand up to Nazis in small ways.

Lubitsch has his way with the Nazi's with more talent, good-heartedness and worldly wisdom then Roberto will ever begin to understand.

Jack Benny as that great, great stage actor, Josef Tura (world famous throughout Poland!), and Carole Lombard are hilarious.  Aside from the first couple of minutes, the whole movie is a laugh riot.  Amazing how well the script and performances have stood the test of time.  Truly one of the greatest comedies of the 40s!  Best lines:  ""So they call me Concentration Camp Airhart, eh?"" and ""What he did to Shakespeare, we are now doing to Poland."" and ""To be or not to be ...""

365007,5,630170648X,"""To Be or Not to Be"" has the distinction of being the last movie starring Carole Lombard before her tragic death in an airplane crash in 1942 and is also remembered as having Jack Benny's finest film performance.  But beyond the qualities of the stars Ernst Lubitsch's film deserves to be singled out for its anti-Nazis position, a distinction shared with Charlie Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" and few other films.  Keep in mind that the film was released on February 15, 1942, not only a month after Lombard's death but only two months after Pearl Harbor, which means it was in the works before the United States entered World War II.
Lubitsch and Melchior Lengyel came up with the story, which was turned into a screenplay by Edwin Justus Mayer.  The story of ""To Be or Not to Be"" is of a Polish theatrical company that is in Warsaw preparing to perform an anti-Nazi melodrama on the eve of World War II.  In the leading roles are the husband and wife team of Maria (Lombard) and Joseph Tura (Benny), who are trained in Shakespeare.  However, the production is canceled by the Polish government because they are afraid Germany will attack the country is a play critical of the Nazis goes on (you know how touchy Hitler can be).  So the Turas put on ""Hamlet"" instead and while Joseph does Hamlet's ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy, Maria is visited backstage by Lieutenant Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack), a young pilot in the Polish Air Force.  Then the war breaks out, Sobinski makes it to London to fight with the RAF, and the Turas remain in occupied Warsaw.
While in London Sobinski meets with Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), a Nazi agent posing as a Polish patriot, who gets the names of friends and relatives from the pilots.  Sobinski becomes suspicious and is sent to Warsaw to recover the list from Siletsky before he gives it to the Nazis.  In Warsaw Maria helps Sobinski, but then she is arrested by the Gestapo as Siletsky tries to get her to join the Third Reich.  To rescue his wife Joseph and the other actors masquerade as Nazi soldiers and end up with one of them (Tom Duggan) dressing up as Hitler to help in the great escape.
This is a comedy, but it is not a broad comedy in which the whole thing descends into slapstick, otherwise the overt attempts at anti-Nazi propaganda would not work.  There is a similarity between ""To Be or Not to Be"" and the television situation comedy ""Hogan's Heroes,"" in terms of presenting the Nazis as incompetent buffoons, personified by Sig Ruman as Colonel Ehrhardt.  The difference is that Lubitsch still manages to work in the idea that the Nazis are also killer clowns.  However, the biggest joke is that these actors, less than inspiring on the stage in Shakespeare, are so convincing playing Nazis.  Meanwhile, Joseph cannot quite bring himself to belief that Maria is actually cheating on him.
Keep in mind that when this film was made ""concentration camps"" did not mean what they mean today; the terms was used by the United States to describe the camps in which Japanese-Americans were interred during the war.  But then when you see Jack Benny walk in as a Nazi you know this is a different time and place.  The humor is pretty coarse for a film from the early Forties (e.g., Ehrhardt recalls Joseph's performance of ""Hamlet"" and declares, ""What he did to Shakespeare we are doing to Poland""), but then keep in mind who is being made fun of here and you have to admire the bite that they put into some of these bits.  Benny is pretty much perfect for this part and Lombard sparkles throughout.  As is usually the case, the original is much better than the 1983 remake with the husband and wife team of Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft.",1076544000,,3702,4.617378048780488

365078,5,630170648X,"Ernst Lubitsch's 1942 version of ""TO BE OR NOT TO BE"", is the #1 BLACK COMEDY classic of all-time.  Selected by the American Film Institute (AFI) in 2000 as one of the greatest films in the ""TOP 100 Years, 100 Laughs"" category. (Carole Lombard was also selected as one of the Top 25 Hollywood Female Legends. (AFI's 100 Years 100 Stars (1999)).
NOTE: Black or Dark Comedy - are movies that can make us laugh but also instill an uneasy feeling.  The laughter comes from subject matter that is offbeat & perhaps a little macabre.
Summary:  Director Ernst Lubitsch's Black Comedy is about a Polish troupe of actors headed by Joseph Tura (Jack Benny - hysterical (best known for radio & television)) & his wife Maria (Carole Lombard - talented & beautiful (this was her final picture. She died in an airplane crash 3 weeks after film completion.  Returning home to her husband Clark Gable from a very successful ""War Bond"" drive.).  They find their work & lives interrupted because of Nazi occupation during WWII.  To protect the Polish underground the actors become involved in various schemes requiring them to impersonate Nazi Officials & soldiers confusing their operations.  This creates a satirical (Dark Comedy) situation.  The actors are able to expose a dangerous double agent, foil the Nazis & escape the country safely.
A genius Director, fabulous cast ""TO BE OR NOT TO BE (1942)"" remains as one of the great films filled with; propaganda, farces, spies, thrills, melodrama, tragedy, even vaudeville wrapped all in one unforgetable package!!!!
This VHS Video, 99 minutes in length, no extras, presented in Black & White, Full Screen format w/hi-fi sound.  Excellent quality picture & sound.
This is a timeless Black Comedy that everyone can enjoy & experience the war years of Hollywood & its invaluable contribution.  ""To Be Or Not To Be"" that is the answer!  Enjoy.",1015372800,,1874,4.936305732484076
365079,5,630170648X,"If there is any film in the history of cinema that is utterly without flaw, it is this one. The camera work is perfect, Lombard and Benny are perfect, the script is perfect. There is not one step even slightly out of rhythm, not one note off by even a 32nd, not by even a 64th.
This is the story of a Polish repertory troupe, the members of which become undercover operators for the Polish Resistance when Hitler's Germany invades.
This film was made in 1942, so it took great risks that are difficult to appreciate now-- when the film premiered, no one knew how the war would turn out, who would win. And the premise, which seems such a bleak subject, is given a comic treatment. Audiences in 1942 failed to see what was so funny and the critics panned it. Fortunately later audiences have rediscovered it.
Black comedy was not a recognized genre at the time, and film historians credit To Be or Not to Be with creating the genre. This film spawned M*A*S*H, Dr. Strangelove, Heathers and so many other films.

But he proves to be an actor, trying to test his make-up and Josef Tura's company is putting on a play about the Gestapo - the uniforms will come in handy later on!..........Today, TO BE OR NOT TO BE can be seen, and it certainly is by me, as one of Hollywood's most polished and perfectly controlled masterworks. Technically, it is one of the finest comedy screenplays ever constructed, a bravura piece of ensemble acting, of running gags which all pay off. The lines, dryly delivered, still evoke an appreciative smile. True, it takes a little time to warm up, and the heavy commentor sounds as though he had stayed from THE MARCH OF TIME. Jack Benny? Lubistch's choice at the time brought ripples of surprise and concealed mirth, but Benny was more than a brilliant stand-up comic. Given proper direction, as here, he was an accomplished comedy actor, never forcing to pace and well capable of handling the melodrama as well as the gags. As for LaLombard, this was, in her own opinion, her finest performance on film; she's brilliant and efficient, whether flirting with the flyer who can ""drop three tons of dynamite in two minutes"" or with the susceptible Siletsky - ""Shall we drink to a blitzkrieg?"" - ""I prefer a slow encirclement"".

Try and control your hysterical laughter or you'll miss the next joke. Watch how Lubitsch turned Nazis into props for his gags.

365085,5,630170648X,"I find it exasperating that so few of Ernst Lubitsch's films are currently available in either video or DVD.  By any reckoning, he is one of the few absolute masters of the cinema (he even makes Andrew Sarris's list of  Pantheon directors).  A few of his best films (this one, HEAVEN CAN WAIT,  NINOTCHKA) are in print, but several others are not, while lesser films  like ANGEL, BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE, and THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER are.  (A very fine film that Lubitsch began but was finished by Frank Borzage  because of Lubitsch's illness is also available, DESIRE, with Marlene  Dietrich.)  I have no complaint that these movies are available, but when  superior films such as ONE HOUR WITH YOU, THE LOVE PARADE, and, my own  personal favorite, TROUBLE IN PARADISE, are not, then something has gone  wrong.  I would also like to see MONTE CARLO, DESIGN FOR LIVING, and LADY  WINDEMERE'S FAN rereleased.

7815339,2,630170648X,"The movie begins in Warsaw, Poland in 1939, in the days just before the invasion by Germany and the USSR (though the movie disregards the latter). Though the threat of war is in the air, a theater company's actors and staff spend their time worrying and arguing over theatrical roles and their status in the company. Also, a young bomber pilot has his eye upon an actor's wife (who is an actress herself), and tries to enter an affair with her.

The invasion comes. Most of the company has fled Poland, including the pilot, who has joined the Polish exile forces in Britain. However, the actor and his actress wife remain. A professor is sent from Britain to Poland to help the resistance there...but he becomes suspected as a double agent, and the pilot is sent to Poland to stop the professor's intended treachery. He warns the actors who are still there, and they in turn impersonate various Gestapo members to try to foil the professor. Unfortunately for the pilot, the husband he tried to cuckold is upset with him, which complicates things.

And unfortunately, it makes everything too complicated and confusing, and ruins the rest of the movie. Also not helping was the joke about ""Concentration Camp Gerhardt"" which became irritating after being repeated a dozen times. Also, many scenes went on for far too long after they made their point.
