3512232,3,B001CFEBWA,"child probably needs to be older to enjoy this, like say at least 3 or maybe even 5.  the songs themselves are well sung.  a lot of effort was taken to choreograph the videos accompanying the songs.  the most annoying things about this dvd are: 1.there is an ad and the same ad with the brand or i guess producer of the video and the words ""baby boost"" said and written on screen between EACH song.  when you have this many songs and you do that between each one it is more than ridiculous.  it is highly annoying.  also, 2.there are way too many quickly shown images/scenes for each song--it is hard even for a weary parent to follow without a bit of a headache.  three stars only cause the songs are well sung and dvd viewed 1 song at a time is ok.",1243382400,,750,4.166666666666667
3512233,5,B001CFEBWA,"I got this DVD a few months ago and it was the first one to ever get my daughter's attention. She is not a big fan of TV, but she adores this DVD. She sings (as much as she can using baby language!) and dances to the songs, clapping her hands and stomping her feet. Some featured kids cannot carry a tune, but she doesn't seem to mind at all. She absolutely loves this DVD. It is a great buy for toddlers.",1241481600,,405,3.951219512195122
3512234,5,B001CFEBWA,"We first learned about ""Baby Boost"" by finding it on Comcast On Demand.  When our daughter was around the 3-4 month mark, we had a hard time getting her to sleep sometimes.  We would turn these on and sing along and ""bop"" around the living room and she would be out in no time.  Now (she is 11 months), we use them for ""wind down"" time before bed and naps.  As soon as she sees Baby Boost she sits back and relaxes, drinks a bottle and after about 10 minutes we put her in bed and she puts herself to sleep.  She prefers seeing ""real"" kids over cartoon characters, so these work for us.  The songs are great too.",1233014400,4,612,4.100840336134453
3512235,4,B001CFEBWA,I ordered this DVD for my son and he loves listening to these nursery rhymes. This is a great buy for little kids in the house.,1232755200,,127,3.923076923076923
3512236,5,B001CFEBWA,My 2 year old is entirely captivated while watching this DVD. She stays focused while the DVD is on. She enjoys every time she hears babby boost before each song. Even I and my wife do like this DVD. It is well done and the kids are so cute. I am happy with the purchase. The shipping was fast. I would buy it again. Thanks!,1336694400,,324,4.0
3512237,2,B001CFEBWA,"The CD Is ok. The DVD seems to be recorded in the 80's. Plus, there is this annoying logo. Between every song the company logo is there. Plus, I didn't think the DVD was attractive enough to my 1omyhs old baby. Sorry...",1326240000,,219,4.238095238095238
3512238,5,B001CFEBWA,"My daughter first saw the cd in you tube at 3 months old. She was so fixated on it that we decided to get the DVD. Yes, the promo between each song is annoying but at 13 months now, she still loves it and has learnt some actions from the kids on the DVD. Watching kids playing and singing engages her every time...we are bored, but she never is!",1324944000,,345,4.0144927536231885
3512239,2,B001CFEBWA,"This DVD doesn't seem to be professionally done. For the video part of this DVD they just used videos of kids playing at various playgrounds and in some studio set ups, which is OK if your child likes to watch other kids playing, but otherwise there is almost nothing going on to catch a child's attention. The bad part for me though is singing itself. It's like a chainsaw on my ears! The voices are so out of tune! I understand that the creators of this DVD used just real kids to sing the songs, but I wish they'd hired professional children's choir for this production. The logo ad between the songs seems unnecessary but not as annoying as singing itself. I wouldn't use this DVD for musical education for kids.",1323475200,,716,4.473282442748092
3512240,5,B001CFEBWA,"My grandson loved the Baby Boost nursery rhymes ""On Demand"" through our cable TV provider, but the episodes only ran about ten minutes, requiring me to restart/choose another episode, so I was excited to find a DVD.
When grandson was an infant, I'd set him in his swing, pop in this DVD, and he was totally enthralled! It's pretty much young children playing in various settings, such as a farm or a playground. All of the songs are sung by children, and it is actually pleasant to hear-not the squeaky, nerve-grating vocals that might be expected in a children's sing a long. There is no dialogue, and only a few cameo adult sightings.

A prior commenter disliked the frequent Baby Boost ""ads"", but they go by quickly.

I hate to admit it, but my grandson spent quite a bit of time watching this video! He was a fussy baby, and this was one sure way to keep him happy. He is now 2 1/2, and still requests his ""baby show"". He knows the words to all the songs, and also enjoys listening to the music CD while in the car.

Well worth the nine dollar price tag! I recommend this for anyone with a baby or young child, and it has become my go-to baby shower gift.",1323216000,,1159,4.331797235023042
3512241,2,B001CFEBWA,The Baby Boost promo between songs is just annoying to say the least. Stopped watching it after the first time. I should sell it on Amazon.,1316390400,,139,4.384615384615385
3512242,5,B001CFEBWA,"Can't say enough about this DVD!!!  My daughter has never been a TV watcher, which is a good thing.  BUT I needed something to entertain her for 20 minutes or so while I cook dinner.  I found these On Demand and tried it out. She was instantly hooked!  I don't know what it is about them, but she loves it!  She's 16 months old.  Now she will bring me the remote and want me to turn it to her ""show"".  I think I have created a monster.",1315353600,,435,3.9310344827586206
3512243,5,B001CFEBWA,"My little one loves watching Baby boost and he dances,smiles at every song. This is what a parent wants to see!!!",1309737600,,113,4.428571428571429
3512244,1,B001CFEBWA,DVD has product commercial every other song and most of the songs are not the complete original songs but are shortened or modified versions also the video is repetitious in that the same scenes are used over for multiple songs.,1304899200,,228,4.725
3512245,2,B001CFEBWA,"The songs are awesome, but there is a promo for the DVD company between every two songs. My one year old loves the songs, but quickly loses interest during the promos",1299888000,,166,4.387096774193548
3512246,5,B001CFEBWA,"My 3 year old granddaughter loves this DVD.  She has lots of other sing-a-long DVD's, but this is her favorite one by far.  She really relates to the kids in the DVD and loves that there are lots of animals too.  She never sings along to other DVD's, but does to this one.  She's a very high energy child and this DVD gets her to sit quietly and sing along.  Yes, I agree the company does interject it's logo with annoying frequency, but my granddaughter doesn't seem to mind this at all.  Would highly recommend this to anyone.",1290988800,,528,4.336734693877551
3512247,5,B001CFEBWA,"I learned of Baby Boost on On Demand Cable TV. I played it for my toddler, when I realized how much he liked it, I wanted to buy him his own DVD. I am not one to promote using televison to babysit your children, but I noticed how if Baby Boost was on, my son sat still. Keep in mind he's two, so this is actually impressive. The video contains kid-friendly songs and nursery rhymes that most children learn during their childhood at some point. There is some real-life video of children acting out the words of the songs and other video of kids just being kids. The colors in the video are bright and stimulating. The content of this video is quite refreshing, because you don't have to worry about any material that may be offensive. It's simply just a fun video that you and your child can enjoy together.",1275955200,,807,4.3509933774834435
3512248,5,B001CFEBWA,"My son is 15months old and he doesn't show much interest in watching any TV/cartoons. I borrowed many dvd to see if he's interest in any of them...baby einstein (mozart, my first sign, etc), barney, dora, elmo, sesame street, etc. I'm not asking for him to sit in front of the TV all day. All I want is like 15-20min a day so I can get sth done. He's very clingy too. All of the above I mentioned, the most he watched is prob 5min. Finally, I borrowed Baby Boost from the library and he likes it and would watch it for like 10-20min=)and he would clap along w/ certain songs. So I bought it on Amazon and this one has both DVD and CD so I can play the CD while driving. This is the only DVD he would actually watch for more than 5min.",1269043200,,734,4.034246575342466
3512249,4,B001CFEBWA,"Cute songs and videos for a 3 yr  old and a great price.  My son has been singing, ""a tisket a tasket""  ALL DAY!  :)",1265414400,,116,3.52
3512250,5,B001CFEBWA,"I first brought this DVD (from library) when my son was around 1. First few time the promo between every song was VERY annoying! At that time he didn't showed much interest in songs.
But now (son is 1.5 years now) this has became his favourite DVD. He really enjoys all songs. He dances, claps, stomps, turns around etc. etc. Songs are sung well, well acted. One of the reason my son loves this is the fact that most of the songs are sung/acted in his playdate. Now I sometimes use promo break to stop DVD and tell him that DVD has finished.",1264377600,,541,4.262135922330097
3512251,5,B001CFEBWA,"It may sound crazy, but since my daughter was 2 months old she has loved these nursery rhymes. I think she likes the music in combination with all of the kids playing. It's such a simple movie, I just wish I would have thought of making it LOL! I found this first on Comcast On Demand but after a while they narrowed them down to 2 nursery rhymes that were 9 min each. Needless to say, I became sooo tired of hearing the same ones, though my daughter never did. So I decided to purchase some dvds. I just turn this on when she is being a grump and she is completely healed LOL!",1262476800,,577,4.0701754385964914
3512252,2,B001CFEBWA,"I bought this for my 17-month-old twin niece and nephew in hopes it might be a nice departure from the Baby Einstein that they are enthralled with. They know many of the nursery rhyme songs from daycare and sing them often. I'm so glad I watched this video before I gave it to them. I'm not sure what is worse, the incredibly annoying and disruptive advertisement for the video producers between EVERY song or the bad reverb on each singer making them sound painfully flat and unpracticed.

The only things I can say to its credit is that the locations used were very interesting and the lyrics of the songs sung were the most traditional I've found to date.

If this was originally made for the children involved in the production as maybe a school project to have as a keepsakeand not intended for wide-release, I could excuse the basement production value. I'm glad to have only paid $3 at my local grocery store for this video. It was a very disappointing watch.",1257552000,,966,4.578034682080925
3512253,4,B001CFEBWA,"The videos are great.  The only problem is that between each video it says ""baby boost"" and then it goes to the next video.  It is as if they just took all the clips that were on cable and put them together without taking out the ""start up"" part for each video.  The kids don't seem to mind but in my mind it doesn't create a nice flow of video",1246838400,,344,3.8857142857142857
3512254,2,B001CFEBWA,"This is not a bad DVD, in and of itself. The songs are fun, familiar nursery sing-a-longs, sung by children's voices, with sweet little videos for each song. The deal breaker is that the company puts its logo and product jingle between EVERY SINGLE SONG! I assume that these were probably recorded as filler for kids programing, possibly between full length shows, and so they are tagged by the producer. But come on, what an incredibly lazy editing job, to not remove those tags when you compile all of them into one disk. Not only is it completely maddening to the parent, but I feel like they are insidiously imprinting their brand into my child's brain by non-stop repetition! For Pete's sake! Hire an editor!",1245715200,,713,4.712
3512255,3,B001CFEBWA,"This is a good DVD with very good children's songs.  Between every song, however, there is an annoying promo for the company that did the DVD.  This tends to make my toddler lose interest and we can't make it to the end of the DVD. If you're planning to use it in the car, note that it does not have the auto start feature and has to be started manually.",1245024000,3,354,4.042857142857143
8287495,5,B001CFEBWA,My children love these rhymes and watched them with great interest as youngsters.  They loved singing the rhymes when away from the shows as well and were happy when I sang to them as well.,1405728000,,189,4.4
8287496,3,B001CFEBWA,"I bought this to keep the kids busy instead of having to play each one on demand every 9 minutes. It did have some small skipping in the middle, but it does what I expected it to. This will NOT play in a cd player in a car for music or anything just an FYI.",1386892800,,257,3.690909090909091
8287497,5,B001CFEBWA,grankids just love this will buy more im sure of it keeps them very alert and entertained thanks baby music makers,1379808000,,114,4.476190476190476
8287498,5,B001CFEBWA,"Besides the annoying (for adult anyway) intro before each song, I don't really have any complaint. The songs are great. My two year old daughter especially likes the song A-Tisket, A-Tasket and dances with her little basket every time. It was so cute.",1371513600,,251,4.8604651162790695
8287499,4,B001CFEBWA,"Although the segments are relatively short, the songs featuring timeless children's melodies and lyrics are a delight for all ages.",1366156800,,131,5.6
8287500,2,B001CFEBWA,Mediocre. My 2 and 1/2 year old twins don't get into it. The stupid ads in between almost every song are so annoying. It really takes away any appeal it might have. My kids like Baby Einstein Nursery Rhymes better. This one is going to Goodwill.,1362355200,,245,4.3478260869565215
8287501,5,B001CFEBWA,"My two years old boy just love this DVD, he even signs alone with the kids, I can see him being excited just by seeing the kids in the DVD.",1359590400,,139,3.6666666666666665
8287502,4,B001CFEBWA,"for the annoying tags.  The first time I borrowed this video from our local library, my son LOVED it.  He loved it so much we purchased it from Amazon.  The only thing that is really annoying on this DVD is that between EVERY song there is a Baby Boost promo and between EVERY TWO songs there is a Baby Boost and Select on Demand promo.  It gets very annoying at first and then, for the most part, I learned to tune it out.  But, really, when they made the DVD they could have eliminated those tags.  Also, the music CD that comes with the DVD, does not have all the songs from the DVD.  It just has about twelve of them done twice, once with kids singing and once with just the music.  He still listens to the CD and enjoys it nonetheless.",1358294400,,740,4.125874125874126
8287503,5,B001CFEBWA,"The frequent ""baby boost"" is annoying to my ear but seemingly not affecting my 3 year old daughter's love for this dvd. It has been over five months and she still loves it! She has been watching it over and over and learned to sing so many songs. Highly recommend this to children who like to sing.",1348790400,,298,4.245614035087719
8287504,1,B001CFEBWA,"This DVD is old , like over 20 years since it was recorded, sound is lousy.
After every song you get to spend 5-10sec' looking at the company logo and hear the advertising.
Waste of money
I don't think that a baby DVD should have any advertising what's educational about it ??
my 18MO. didn't like it.",1343260800,,301,4.298245614035087
