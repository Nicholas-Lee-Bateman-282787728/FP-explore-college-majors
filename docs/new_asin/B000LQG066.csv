8163605,5,B000LQG066,We just watched it again last night.  It is a very amateur video but I think that gives it even more charm.  It does show you exactly how to make your first chainsaw bear step by step.  He also talks about the safety gear you must buy and the proper tools needed.  Great video and the music is funny. I would buy more from him if he sells anymore chainsaw art how to videos.,1390435200,,374,4.013513513513513

8163608,5,B000LQG066,"I love Steve's video.  He makes a great bear, and it sells, and it doesn't take any wood at all.  It's a pretty good starting point if you're not sure you really want to get into this life.

For most people, the bear comes out pretty small.  It's proportional in the slipcase picture, but Steve's a big guy.  What I mean to say is, it will be tricky with a big-box, ""regular"" chainsaw.  You'll find the bear a lot easier to carve with a shortish (12"" or even 8"") bar and a dime or quarter tip.  As always when running a chainsaw, wear your chaps.",1282262400,4,546,4.142857142857143
