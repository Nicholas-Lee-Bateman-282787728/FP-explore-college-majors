4267565,5,B0046BAAUE,"I just got done doing this workout for the first time, and really loved it!  It's my first Tracey Mallett workout, and I really like her personality.  She's friendly and encouraging, and gives excellent form pointers throughout the workout.

To do this workout, you'll need a chair and some three- or five-pound hand weights.  A yoga mat is also helpful for the core and stretch section at the very end of the workout.

Since another reviewer already gave an excellent breakdown of the workout, I'll just add in that this workout is a great addition to the barre workouts that are already out there.  Although the title of her series (Booty Barre) says that the focus is on the rear end, the actual workout title (Total New Body) gives an indication that it's a full-body workout -- and you will definitely feel every muscle group being worked during the sixty-five minutes!

Also, when I read reviews of new workouts, I like to know if they will add something to my fitness library, and this one definitely does.  I'm a barre newbie and have only been doing barre workouts for a few months, so my barre library is pretty limited -- I have the two Physique 57 workout series (six DVD's total),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Exhale-Core-Fusion-Body-Sculpt/dp/B001AZI236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Exhale: Core Fusion - Body Sculpt</a>, the three Squeeze workouts by Tracy Effinger, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ROCKIN-MODELS-Workout-DVD-with-Grace-Lazenby/dp/B004281OJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ROCKIN MODELS Workout DVD with Grace Lazenby</a>, and this one is very different from all of those other workouts.

For starters, it's got one of the best upper body/arms sections on any of the above-mentioned workout, except for the upper body segment of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Effinger-s-Squeeze-Stronger-fitness-workout/dp/B001N8BKTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy Effinger's Squeeze Stronger (fitness workout)</a>.  The upper body section on P57 always seems short to me, but Tracey's workout really works parts of the upper body (including rear delts) more thoroughly.

It also has a great cardio factor, almost like the P57 workouts.  In fact, in one segment, she has you use the front of the chair and also the floor to do some cardio moves to get your heart rate up there.

A couple of the exercises I've seen in other workouts, but almost everything in this workout was new and fresh to me, and I really felt the moves!  One of the four background exercisers also shows modifications for some of the movements for those who are new to barre workouts.

Overall, this is a really fun workout that I know I will use a lot!  I'm had excellent results doing barre workouts, and love getting new workouts that will keep me motivated.

UPDATED ON 12/29/10:  I did this workout for the second time today, and just wanted to reiterate that it's a fantastic workout that is really challenging, but also fun!  I hope Tracey puts out more workouts like this one soon!",1293148800,79,3115,5.589361702127659
4267566,5,B0046BAAUE,"The DVD has four sections:

Warmup (8:48):
Lots of second position plie variations, including some fast-paced side to side moves.  There is a person doing modifications that does not go down very low in the plies. That modification may help some with tricky knees.  After the plies, she moves into crescent pose variations and then planks pulling back into downward dog. Then something similar to a pulsing warrior 2, before repeating crescent pose, planks, and downward dog on the other side.  The warm up is fast paced, but I found it very doable.

Sculpted Arms (9:57):
All done standing with dumbbells. She recommends 3 lb weights working up to 5 lbs. I used 5 lbs.  I find some upper body barre routines using weights are a bit light but really liked this one.  While not as intense as Squeeze Stronger, I felt like I got a nice upper body workout. She does traditional exercises, but adds her own twist to make them interesting.

Booty Barre Workout (32:41):  Includes:
o calf raises
o diamond plie variations, including side to side hip movements
o second position plie variations
o lunge, and then moving the back leg forward to kick up into the air (similar to grand battement)
o curtsy squats with kicks
o pulsing arabesque/attitude combo for the glutes
o figure-4 standing stretch
o repeat lunge, curtsy squat, and arabesque/attitude variations, and figure-4 stretch on other side
o second position plie, lifting outside leg up and elbow down to work the obliques
o wide squat pulses kicking leg out to the side
o more standing glute work (just over 2 minutes)
o Repeat second position plie/squat/glute work on other side
o The above takes almost 20 minutes and then she moves into cardio. For cardio, she goes into a reverse lunge and then brings the back leg forward. She also includes mountain climbers and a plank variation jumping the legs in and out.
o She then moves into the ""final segment"" with parallel thigh plie work and more diamond plies
o She closes with some standing stretches, and then more glute work!

Abs & Flexibility (12:43)
o Knee dancing (this is up and down movement and pulsing, as opposed to leaning back that is done in some barre workouts)
o (22) pushups, some slow and some fast (she does these bent knee, I modified to toe pushups)
o Ab work (approx. 4 minutes)
o Side plank balances (T-stand)
o Locust pose
o Flexibility starts at about 8:43

COMMENTS:  I really had a lot of fun doing this workout.  There is a lot of glute work!!  I didn't feel the intense burn in the thighs I can get from slower paced, small movement, Lotte Berk inspired workouts, but I also think that as I learned this DVD better that might come more with time.  Even without the burn, though, I felt I got a good leg workout.

I really like Tracey and think she is a great instructor.  She is energetic and peppy, but not over the top.  She seems like she is having fun, and I did too!

It is fast paced but not too much so.  I was able to keep up through the entire workout and didn't have any safety concerns that I might injure myself.  Tracey gives a lot of pointers on form, too, which is nice.  I have a sensitive knee, but was able to do the entire workout. Some with sensitive knees might find parts of the DVD difficult.  Always good to know your limitations, and make adjustments if needed.  I have hip dysplasia and am fairly tight in the hips too, but only had a minor problem with a short segment of the main workout (had to keep my leg lower than hers).  There was a nice cardio pace to most of the workout.

My only complaints were that ab work and flexibility section are pretty short.  I did my own stretches after.  But overall, I enjoyed the workout so much that those seem like minor points!  This is a keeper for me!",1292630400,213,3756,4.506646971935007
4267567,4,B0046BAAUE,"Whoa..... For Beginners Definitely a Tough Workout ... Ensure you follow the FORM instructions otherwise your knees will take a brunt .... Definitely a good Total Body Work Out which lasts for 64 Mins...Also has  good upper body workout with light weights

4267577,3,B0046BAAUE,"I really wanted to like this DVD, but I just can't. I'll start by saying that it offers a GREAT workout (hence my 3-star review, as I was tempted to go 2-star), but I don't think it should be categorized as a ""barre"" workout. I've recently begun a love affair with barre, and I've used several DVD's, as well as gone to classes in person. This DVD isn't like any other barre session I've ever done, and I've even done ""rhythm and barre"" classes, which include a dance/cardio element. During this entire workout, there were probably less than 10 minutes (spread apart, of course) where I felt like I was actually doing a barre workout. The rest of the time, I just felt like I was doing another aerobics video. There's a lot of ""hip shaking,"" where she basically makes you dance, but it doesn't strike me as effective in any way, and feels like a big waste of valuable workout time. She often moves quickly, and she doesn't give much direction as to form, which is especially important in a workout like this. She includes a cardio section that is neither ballet, nor pilates, nor yoga. It's just pure aerobic cardio. If I wanted aerobics, I would have purchased an aerobic DVD. Again, the workout you get is great (if you can even finish the entire thing - it's brutal)! But I personally feel that labeling it a ""barre"" workout is misleading.",1433721600,7,1342,4.526748971193416
4267578,5,B0046BAAUE,"WHOA. Prepare to work! I don't know what I was thinking, but of late I've gotten into HIIT fitness workouts, which are always 30 minutes MAX. This DVD is an hour long, and something on your body is burning the entire time after the warm up. Lots of squats and ballet moves that are repeated multiple times. I could never get my legs as high as hers, and could never do as many reps non-stop as she or any of her other workout girls could. I've only done it a couple of times so far, but feel challenged and hope to be able to get through the entire workout soon. I've had to stop at the 30 minute mark so far, and am sore for days after. Ballet will whip you're body into some kinda shape! But of course, I knew this from previous ballet workouts. The only equipment you will need is a dining chair that comes about waist high.",1433289600,,827,4.142857142857143

4267581,5,B0046BAAUE,"Wow this is an intense workout. I have tried other videos by Tracey Mallet and I chose this one because it had an arm section and a flexibility section. I like that there is a warmup (which is pretty much a workout on its own), an arm workout, the main workout and an abs and flexibility section so you can do them all together or pick and choose.",1428019200,,347,4.117647058823529
4267582,5,B0046BAAUE,"Great workout! It combines cardio and barre and is an intense workout. I love the Physique 57 workouts for their cardio and intensity, and this is similar to that only fewer breaks. It definitely gets your heart rate up and works your body.",1427155200,,240,4.604651162790698

4267585,5,B0046BAAUE,"Although I am a fairly advanced exerciser, I've never tried barre before. I exercise 4-6x weekly, mostly doing HIIT, strength, and yoga or pilates. This workout was awesome! I could keep up, but it was difficult. I had the sweat dripping off me by the end. I'm totally going to look into other Tracey Mallett barre workouts.",1420243200,2,324,4.701754385964913
4267586,3,B0046BAAUE,"Pros: funny. Tracey is a good instructor. Good cueing, not annoying. Comprehensive, there are short sections for arms, cardio and abs, so it's not all lower body like many other barre workouts. Cons: I don't think all those small pulses do much to build muscle or improve overall fitness... What's more, I don't think they are good for the hips and knee joints either, too much pressure. Barre workouts work the calves too much to me, if you are a runner and wear heels you don't need to fatigue them more... so I do most of the moves with the soles of the feet on the floor. Hard, I needed to take some breaks.",1414972800,2,611,4.368421052631579

4267592,5,B0046BAAUE,"Not much to say other than, I love this program because it incorporates a lot of the back muscle groups which keep my back aligned in form and appearance.  This program also has a great deal of leg work which is a characteristic of Tracey's classes to keep the legs lean and toned.",1407801600,2,281,4.30188679245283
4267593,5,B0046BAAUE,"Barre workouts are my latest fitness finds and I am always on the lookout for new routines.  I have done Physique 57, Suzanne Bowen and Leah Sarago, but I am always interested in trying new instructors.

This is a 60 minute workout.  You can play the entire workout, or if your time is short, just choose which sections you want to do.

The workout sections are:
* Booty Barre Warm-up (8:48 minutes)
* Booty Barre Sculpted Arms (9:57 minutes)
* Booty Barre Workout (32:44 minutes)
* Booty Barre Abs and Flexibility (12:43).

Minimal equipment is needed for this workout.  All you need is:  a sturdy chair or ballet barre,  3-5 pound weights, and a mat.

Why I love this workout:

* Tracey! She is a delightful instructor and is very motivating.  I love her British accent.  I also love the fact that she doesn't talk constantly like the Physique 57 instructors. She talks just enough to give you form pointers and to push you to work harder.

* Who knew that upper body exercises with 3 pound weights could be such killers?  I started out using 5 pound weights like Tracey, but very quickly moved to 3 pound and then to no weights.  Hah, and I consider myself an advanced exerciser.

* The very ballet-like feel to this workout.  I think it's because she uses the ballet terms and just moves so gracefully.

* The energy of the workout.  Even though you aren't jumping up and down, your heart rate gets up there since you are moving quickly from one exercise to the next.

If you are looking for a fun barre workout that will also leave you feeling energized, then you should try this one.",1407024000,8,1589,4.489510489510489

Good overall workout too.  Great arm section.  I fit this in often.  The only downside is the chick is slightly annoying but not so much I won't do the workout.",1407024000,4,434,4.283950617283951

But, I promise you, if you stick with it......you will be amazed (I WAS) at what your body can do. I think this workout proved to me that we all have a little bit of dancer in us somewhere.

I've tried 3 of Tracey's videos and this one is my favorite. It is challenging (THE ARM SECTION), it is fun, and the run time is perfect for me.

The point is: Get a little bit stronger and better EVERY.DAY. Tracey is a great coach for that. This is a great workout for that....",1400803200,2,642,4.169354838709677

I believe that by doing this DVD on a regular basis one will achieve results!  I did not think Tracy is a bimbo, sure she is blonde and upbeat, but not a bimbo. She does instruct some hip action, but I think since her background is in dance, she is concerned with opening the hips for more flexibly since many women have tight hips.

4267609,5,B0046BAAUE,"I've been doing Pilates for many years, and was long and strong but not cardio fit.  Most cardio exercise seemed so mindless that it bored the pants off of me, or, worse still, was very hard on the joints. Then barre classes appeared in the mainstream a couple of years ago, and I was pleased to find that, although typically termed ""toning"", they were very ""cardio"", and used your brain as well as your body.  I bought about 8 different barre method videos to try, and this one, the Booty Barre, was by far the most enticing.  I liked it because it worked my butt off but was never boring or discouraging, even though, at the beginning, I had to take frequent breaks of 32 or 64 counts and gasp for breath or stretch out some target muscle.  The instructor, Tracey Mallet, was always encouraging and even said to take little breaks as needed, so I never felt like I was slouching, and, if I couldn't do something as well as shown, there was always someone showing a modified version that I could follow.  It did not take many weeks of daily practice for me to be moving like Tracey.  I junked the other DVDs I'd bought and just did this and the other Booty Barre DVDs which I also purchased.  I love what she has created--it is based on the sound principles of Pilates, is very low impact, is a very well-rounded workout (many of the other barre methods just seem to work glutes and thighs only), and she is so cheery and fun to listen to with her little English accent overlaid with California girl that I find the whole thing very uplifting and have been practicing the Booty Barre ever since, though nowadays about 3 times a week instead of daily.  My body is more sculpted with Booty Barre than it ever got with Pilates, even though I work at a fairly advanced level in Pilates.  Even when I fall off the wagon and go into bad eating habits for a few weeks, my abs hold my belly in and I still look good in my pants.  It's amazing!",1388016000,5,1936,4.323204419889502

4267612,5,B0046BAAUE,"What I love about this workout is that I never leave my 3'x3' area and work up a dripping sweat, with NO pounding on my joints. It is such a controlled workout and makes your body feel so fatigued, in a good way. I believe that training these smaller muscle groups through specific positions with your own body weight with small pulsing moves, is the key to getting the body you want. It is a type of exercise that sets your results apart from mainstream exercise.
I think Tracey is very pleasant, motivational, and very qualified to be teaching Barre. The workout is extremely challenging if done in it's entirety, which I do. She works out specific muscles until exhaustion, which forces the muscles to tone. This will be seen through shaking and trembling of the muscles on the last few reps. Expect this- it is normal. And it WILL deliver results. I have been doing it for a few weeks and feel a lot less giggle and appears like my body is getting back to where it was before 4 children. In fact, even better because I didn't do Barre in the past, and like I said, it trains your body in a way that no other exercise does, so your body has no choice but to respond- with leaner thighs, more shapely hamstrings and calves, lifted rear, flatter tummy, and chiseled arms. You can't beat it. This 60 minute workout definitely includes your cardio in addition to toning.",1381276800,2,1369,4.48
4267613,5,B0046BAAUE,"I was looking for something barre related after seeing an informercial where the product advertised ended up being hundreds of dollars.  I also have Tracey's beginner barre DVD, and this is a great partner to that.  A little more advanced and yes, Tracey and her gang are way more flexible than I am, but I don't let that stop me, I simply do what I can.  I am sure I am in way worse shape and more overweight than many reviewers here, but I get a great workout and for the most part can keep up (and down the line, I'm sure I'll be able to do the whole thing non-stop).  I do hate planks, and so I do something else (leg kicks or lifts) for the 2 minutes she does them.  There is great legwork - I can't get through most entire routines without a small breather - and I really enjoy the ballet moves, they are what makes this DVD fun for me.  The 10-minute arm segment is my go-to arms, and I try to do that piece every day.  Tracey is a great instructor, fun, motivating and by no means the ""blonde bimbo"" another reviewer proclaimed.  I really don't like to exercise, but I don't mind doing this...and I'm seeing results.

EDIT: Since purchasing this DVD I have bought several others, and taken many others out of the library.  This workout I feel is the hardest in my rotation and do it faithfully 3 times a week, and do another DVD the other 4 days.  I'm also watching my diet.  In just under a month I'm seeing 3 inches off my hips, with losses elsewhere as well.  The scale is not moving as fast so I know it's this workout.  If you do this workout and really work while you're doing it, the chances are good you'll see results just as satisfying.",1378512000,8,1654,4.20952380952381

The classes at my gym have gotten old and I don't get that nice sore feeling anymore that used to after a great work out. But this changed that! I am surely sore the day or two after this but not so much that I cant do it again.
I would say it's moderately cardio with highly intense intervals using body weight resistance, but for me I'm at my goal weight so I'm not looking for all out cardio every day of the week. If a person needed to loose weight I would suggest doing this workout plus elliptical machine or other form of exercise to raise heart rate and burn more calories for another 30 minutes on top.
Also want to add that the upper body portion is great for me as it's not hard at all. I like to tone my upper body but without hurting myself and sometimes do with stronger exercises.

 I've only done it a few times now so I can't say I'm seeing results yet but I always feel results before I see them and I'm feeling it with this. If you have some fine tuning to do to your rear end I highly suggest this product.",1373673600,2,1158,4.030434782608696

I purchased it because I recently learned I have fibromyalgia and impact exercises, such as jumping in cardio dvd's, and jogging on my treadmill, were really aggravating it.  This workout has no impact and it is ballet based which I love.  As a former dancer I love all the plies, grand battements, and attitudes/arabesques.  These exercises REALLY work your muscles while getting your heart rate up at the same time.  The arms segment and the abs/flexibility segments are also good.  The lighting is good, the music is pleasant, and none of the exercisers are annoying lol!  I also recently purchased Cardio Barre, which I like, but as a dancer I like this workout much better.  This workout will work every muscle in your body and leave you feeling great.  It truly is a ""total body"" workout.  You will gain strength and flexibility as well as get a great cardio workout.

I was sweating bullets throughout, but what I really like about this workout is that despite the fact that it's highly challenging, it's also low-impact (done entirely barefoot).

I'm so glad I bought it!  I'll definitely be doing this DVD often. My goal is to be able to do the whole DVD straight through, which I should be able to do in a month or so.

Tracey explains the form well and has an adorable personality, which makes it so fun to work-out with her.  She uses a lot of moves that I know are so good for my entire body.  I really trust her methods, which is hard to find with at-home workouts!  I am a tough critic, so the fact that I gave this 5 stars really means something!!",1364083200,2,633,4.056451612903226

Next time around I would probably skip the weight section and only do the barre part and it would cut the time to about 45 mins.

She is such an amazing, energetic dynamo who somehow manages to give off this wonderful smile even during the toughest portion of the workout.  This Booty Barre workout is not for the beginner or those who don't like to ""huff and puff.""  Yes, the fast-paced movements have me breathing hard and sweating buckets, but at the same time, I am thoroughly enjoying the workout as I do it.  Even with light weights, my upper always feels very fatigued, not to mention the fabulous lower body workout.  Booty Barre Total New Body clocks in at about an hour, but it is time well spent.  The production values are high - very pleasing set, good film work, well-rehearsed background exercisers and a polished, charasmatic instructor.

I am a dancer (though not a ballerina) and have been in sports all my life (now > 50) and thought I was in good shape and this DVD has taught me some humility. Never underestimate the value of cross-training.  I started out doing the entire DVD in one morning from start to finish which made me sore but if you are active you understand the meaning of ""a good kind of sore"".  I cannot do everything in the DVD yet but I did what I could and kept moving and did the variations she teaches and did not stop. But if her students (who are in the video) can do it then so can I.

This is very different from all of them.  I didn't like it at first, but I didn't hate it.  Now that it's been a while, I rank it up there as one to go in regular rotation though maybe not first, or second, or third.  It's certainly the only workout that has ever made me sweat without tennis shoes on!  I do not look nearly as graceful as they do, but no one cares in my living room :) It's not slow like yoga, and it's hard. My legs definitely felt a burn.

I had no definition in them before...they were slim but not shapely, now they are. My booty has raised, yay :) My legs are toned and defined. I have tried other workouts here and there but got bulky on my thighs and tummy but this hasn't bulked me at all. It has really slimmed my legs. I didn't have a lot of weight to lose when i started this but I was what they call 'skinny fat' and at 43 I needed a bit of tightening up here and there and this worked magic :) I do this and her other barre workouts 3 x per week and add in her Fuse Lean too for variety.

4267642,3,B0046BAAUE,"While the moves are good overall (if sometimes puzzlingly cued), there are a few major drawbacks to this workout:

There are no built in breaks.  She tells you to ""get some water"" at the beginning of the DVD and then never actually offers a 15-30 second rest for you to drink it, so if you need water during the hour-long workout, you have to stop the DVD.

There are no built in transitions either, so when you have to get a chair, mat, or weights, you have to stop the DVD.

Her tone and comments, while encouraging the first few times, are likely to become a little annoying by the 10th or 50th time through the workout.  It would have been better to keep them to a minimum.

She only demonstrates ONE move on another dancer's body throughout the entire workout.  Much more of that technique (including demonstrating proper alignment) would have been helpful and confidence-building.  She is often moving too quickly through the exercise for someone new to the workout to understand the proper postures and to correct if need be.",1337212800,5,1032,4.631868131868132
4267643,4,B0046BAAUE,"This is a gorgeous workout.  It's very lengthy and makes me feel like a dancer.  Tracey does move pretty fast so I did get sweaty.  My favorite part is the arm workout. It's challenging, the arms burn like crazy (which I love) and really provides results. The thigh and booty part is, as I've mentioned, a lot of lengthy type of movements, and, for me, not enough of the conditioning/strengthening; it was pretty long, yet, in all honesty, I was craving more burn at the end of it. Also, the abs section was a bit short, and there were only a couple of exercises that I felt were truly effective (for my body anyway).

Overall, I do really like this workout. I also love Tracy and her demeanor, she does know what she is doing and presents it very well.  However, if you are looking for something more intense, in terms of cardio and muscle conditioning, I don't think this is enough. It really depends on what you are looking for.

Tracy is an upbeat instructor, and not at all annoying. The tough part is really just the workout -- your muscles will be trembling, if you push yourself.

I liked that there is not a long intro at the beginning of the DVD (no wasting time with additional ads!). The arms, booty, and abs workout can be done altogether for a killer workout. Or, you can split them up to alternate muscle groups.",1326758400,4,428,4.3375

Like I said, never have taken ballet before and wish I could turn back time to try but this DVD makes me feel strong, lean, and graceful.. like a ballerina!

For starters, I danced when I younger, but it's been about 8 years since my last ballet class. I also had a child 16 months ago. So I have the foundation and muscle memory, but I'm very out of shape. When I previewed the video, my eyes started bugging out a bit during the warmup, and it just got scarier from there. I told myself to try the warmup and one segment and see how it went. I got through the warm up pleasantly suprised. For the arm weights I could not do 3lbs, had to do 2lbs (and my son is 27lbs, so I have a decent amount of upper-body strength). The Booty Barre section was insane. I made about 1/3rd of the way through (the 'grande battemant/curtsy plie')for each side, and called it a day. I watched the abs section while stretching on my own and was honestly just too tired to even attempt, I knew my form would be off. I was a bit disappointed that the person supposedly doing a modified version rarely demonstrated an easier option. It was a good wakeup call for the amount of work I need to do to get back in shape, and I look forward to seeing results; for now my goal is 2xs a week and hope to get further each time. If you're experienced in dance/Pilates/exercise in general and are comfortable modifying workouts on your own, give it a go and have fun with it. Time did go quickly, and the workout seemed to move faster than other Pilates workouts I have tried; I definitely wasn't bored.

I am 32, fairly fit, and have tried many different kinds of workouts through the years.  I have also done several barre classes where I live including Bar Method, Pop Physique and Cardio Barre.  So I wouldn't classify myself as a beginner.  However, I cannot get through the butt & thighs segment of this class!  I do like the warm up and upper body workouts, they are original and effective.  But about 3/4 through the butt & thigh portion of the video, I am completely spent and can hardly lift my legs to do what Tracey is directing us to do.  Believe it or not, I feel a lot of strain in my lower back (but I think this is because my legs are so tired I am overcompensating).  Another problem may be that I don't have chair that I've found that is sturdy enough.  I find that working with an actual bar is easier for me (I am 5'9 and have long torso).  Anyway, Tracey is bubbly, and impeccably in shape -- she is likable, just not the routine.  I guess I need to start with one of her lower-level DVDs first.  I would only recommend this video to someone who has trained their legs substantially and continuously.

You get a good workout with this video, BUT if you're not flexible it is very difficult.  Tracey moves very fast and all of the exercisers in her video are very flexible.  I found this very discouraging because I can't stretch my legs out that far and when she gets going fast it's difficult to keep up.  Also, there are no video shots from the side, so it's hard to tell what angle they are actually kicking their legs.  More instruction in this video would have been very helpful along with someone not a dancer showing abbreviated moves.",1317340800,29,702,4.410852713178294

I'm surprised at how quick the hour goes!! I've had other Tracey Mallett workouts before and I found her rather piercing but she presents herself very well in this workout. Definately becoming my main workout....I hope I don't get tired of it anytime soon. Workout tapes are just like movies,,you can still only watch it (do it) so many times before you get bored.",1315958400,,683,4.60655737704918
4267655,5,B0046BAAUE,"After working out to the Booty Barre DVD, I felt like I had woken up muscles that had been dormant for years.  And yes, my booty definitely felt it!  I can tell doing this 2 to 3 times a week will completely change my body.  I'm not a dancer, more like a wallflower, so all the dance-like maneuvers, leg lifts, kicks etc..really challenged me. And the Pilates ab exercises are sooo effective.  No wonder people who do Pilates always seem to be rippling with muscle!  The stretching at the end was necessary and a wonderful way to cool down.  Overall the rhythm of the exercises are fluid, fun and effective.  Tracey Mallett's form is perfect and her instruction is easy to follow.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to whoever desires to push their fitness level up several notches. My aerobics videos are history, Booty Barre all the way!",1314748800,,843,4.610738255033557
4267656,2,B0046BAAUE,"I will start by saying that I love Tracey Mallet's other exercise video - I use her 6 Minute Quickblast DVDs more than any other exercise videos I own.  I thought I could trust that her approach to fitness was a stairstep one, starting at the ""doable"" and working up to the ""darn hard but I'm proud I just did that"" stages.

Unfortunately I really feel let down by The Booty Barre, and I think that anyone without significant ballet background should steer clear.  I noticed that most of the positive reviews are by people who mention former ballet training... which I think tells you something.  So rule of thumb for Booty Barre: beginners at ballet, no way; experienced at ballet, go for it.

If I were Tracey Mallet, I'd redo this video with two levels - beginner and advanced - and for the beginner, begin with the really basic moves, but instead of focusing on only one muscle until total muscle failure (read: setting us up for failure), I'd mix it up with different target muscles.  Oh, and stop moving the camer so that the only backup person who is not a professional ballerina is NOT cut out of virtually every shot, we need to see how she is doing it both to see how normal human beings (not Gumby) do the moves, and for moral support. Oh, and not have a professional ballerina as your ""modification"" person when she is actually outdoing Tracey in every single move (not exaggerating! She lifts her leg higher, goes deeper, every time).

When I started thinking ""Tracey, what on earth is wrong with you?!"" when only halfway through the *warmup*, I knew there was a problem.  I actually exercise quite a bit (running, swimming, lifting weights, general aerobics, some biking), I just don't happen to use those specific muscles that ballet uses (e.g. the ability to stand on tiptoe - not really much in demand elsewhere), and I really can't imagine that anyone other than a dancer has those muscles built up either.  After the first 5? 10? minutes of nonstop moves on tiptoe with no break, my calf muscles were knotting and jumping; same later with the  leg raises (I forget the ballet terms) and the arms and - well you get the point. I could have done it if there had been some mixup - tiptoe, leg raises, arms, etc all mixed up.  But I did not start out able to do those moves or with those muscles built up, so guess what - I can't do a whole whole whole whole lotta those moves in a row.  Why on earth wouldn't she mix it up? I'm honestly baffled about what Tracey Mallet was thinking.

I know some people would say ""well then just don't do them"" but that is really bad psychology, and lazy video-making.  I did as long as I could, and then stopped - completely. I had no belief that I could just fast forward and be able to do the next segment.  I tried a few days later, promising myself I just had to make it halfway through, and had to stop again.  Both times I felt like a total failure and was so very discouraged.  I just don't see any way for me to be able to do this video, and there is no motivation to even try since I feel like it sets me up for failure.  I'm giving away this video, and going back to my old routines.  To say I'm discouraged is a very big understatement, and I'm also really surprised (in a bad way) that Tracey Mallet would put out this kind of a video.

Sorry to be so negative, as I said before I really liked Tracey Mallet's other exercise videos, I just thought this one was a real dud for ballet newbies.",1314057600,28,3454,4.342146189735614

This workout is really tuff but very worth it.  I can definitely see a difference in my legs and lost inches everywhere.  The abdominal workout is not that long but still very effective.  Some people have complained about that and wished it was longer, but you really don't need it to be very long because the rest of the workout is working your abs and burning more calories and fat than the ab section does.  The only thing that I wish it had was more cardio/ballet moves (footwork).  There is a lot of isolation moves for toning that are great but I think you would get the best of both if Tracey incorporated a typical ballet warm-up like in ballet class.

4267660,3,B0046BAAUE,"I like Tracey a lot as an instructor. She is encouraging, not too over the top, and her cuing is great. But I caught myself so often swearing at my TV and yelling at Tracey to please stop and start stretching. Yes, the workout is hard, and the poses are challenging. And unfortunately for me, this DVD is nearly impossible to do.

I'm very tight in my hamstrings and my lower back. If you're tight like me, you'll have problems doing at least half of the lower body poses featured on this DVD. There's always the option to modify the poses, but most of the times she was moving too fast for me to correctly follow what she was doing AND modify the poses to my level at the same time. I kept falling and swirling around helplessly, probably looking like a drunk squirrel trying not to fall off a shaking, pulsating tree. I usually want to give up 20 minutes into the workout and really have to force myself to keep pushing. That's why I'm also lacking a feeling of accomplishment after finishing the workout. Usually I want to go hide under a blanket and cry and eat my weeks worth of chocolate all at once to tickle out some post-workout feel-good-endorphins to make me feel remotely human again.

The moves are very effective, and you'll get and amazing workout for the glutes for sure. Booty Barre also offers so much more of a cardio training than most other barre workouts I've tried. But everytime I try it I keep getting frustrated due to my inflexibility. Which is probably also why I wished it had more stretches.

4267663,5,B0046BAAUE,"Tracey Mallett is a demanding but cheerful instructor who brings out the best in her viewers.  I have many, many exercise DVD's, my other favorites being ones by Jari Love, Kari Anderson, Pure Barre, and Amy Dixon, among others.  BOOTY BARRE is an exhausting total body workout if done in full--but it is possible to do separate sections on their own. If you don't have an hour plus to get very sweaty, doing the ""Booty Barre"" section on its own takes about 45 minutes and is a great workout.  These exercises, like Pure Barre and Tracy Anderson, do a great job of calling on secondary muscle groups so that you don't bulk up your dominant muscle groups.  They promote grace and litheness as well as strength and stamina.  I also have Tracey's Advanced Interval Cycling, an excellent audio workout for stationary cycle/trainer.  I highly recommend this DVD for intermediate to advanced exercisers who want a challenge but don't want to stress their joints with high-impact activities.  Though the moves are balletic, no dance skills are required.  I have two left feet and have absolutely no problems.  I'm also in my late 50's, and I recommend Barre training as a primo way to stay in shape without risking injury.",1310342400,8,1215,4.802884615384615

I expect that in a cardio DVD, but it seemed out of place in a ballet-based workout. You can definitely get a good workout with this DVD: this has probably the best arm workout of any of my ballet DVDs. It's tough and I really like this section.

4267666,5,B0046BAAUE,"I'm not a ballet dancer; I have never had a day of ballet instruction in my life, so you don't need any history in dance to do this workout.  I bought this because I found yoga challenging, yet very boring.  I love running, aerobics, and rock climbing.  I have completed marathons in the past and I consider myself in good physical condition; I enjoy pushing myself through challenging endurance workouts.  This definitely fits the bill.  Tracey Mallett pushed me to my limits, but I felt very good (rather than destroyed) at the end of the workout.  Good total body routine.  It's hard to pick out the ""good"" barre workouts from the mediocre or too easy, since this is apparently the new fitness trend.  However, this one definitely ranks among the best.  I expect to use this DVD several times per week for strength training (this workout will have your heart rate elevated and the sweat pouring, so it does not skimp on cardio--I'm just more of a cardio purist, so I'll still hit the treadmill every other day or so).

A few reviewers have complained about Tracey's voice or cheerleader-like attitude.  I have no issue with her voice at all; she has an accent (Australian?) and she will encourage you to ""shake your booty"" or ""work your booty,"" but certainly not in any offensive of phony way.  In my opinion, anyone who dislikes this workout on the basis of her voice alone is making excuses to avoid pushing themselves through this challenging workout.",1308182400,11,1457,4.715415019762846

Unfortunately, this does not mean you get a cardio workout, necessarily, and that is more what I am looking for in workout videos.  That said, I really got a decent workout in the cardio section. Heart rate up there, sweat pouring, legs shaking.  The toning and weights segment were also very good.

Instructor is likeable, cues well, is a little too peppy for me, but her major problem is that she does not have a good voice for this --- too shrieky.  The moves worked well with the music and the backup dancers were non-annoying.  One other problem is that when doing mat work, her microphone would cut in and out, depending if she was facing the mat or the microphone, I guess.  They should have maybe redubbed or something.

It's a lot more fun in my opinion and it makes me look forward to working out. But at the same time - I need something that will really challenge me. I've been doing barre workouts at two different gyms for the past 4 months (which can get expensive) and was looking for a video I could do at home that would be a similar workout in order to save some money.

My main hope was to find a video that combined cardio with barre-style workout and weights. This one was exactly what I was looking for! The moves were very challenging and like I said, I've been doing barre workout 2-3 times a week for the past few months. Every muscle was super fatigued by the end and my heart rate was really high almost the entire time. I really dislike when videos have a lot of space in between the moves where your heart rate comes down. This video kept you moving the ENTIRE time. I was dripping with sweat and barely able to complete all of the reps.

I noticed somebody else commented on the instructor - she was sort of peppy but not irritating. If anything I was getting annoyed at how easy she made everything look when I was practically dying trying to follow along. But for me - that's what I want. I know I will be able to do this workout for a long time and it will continue to challenge me unlike some workouts where it becomes really easy in no time.

4267678,5,B0046BAAUE,"NOTE: I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; you can find a more detailed version of my review on that site.

In her introduction, instructor Tracey Mallett explains that she created The Booty Barre workout to combine elements of barre, dance, Pilates, yoga, and kickboxing. Tracey instructs the workout live in a bright indoor studio with four background exercisers. The only props required for this workout are a sturdy chair (for the barre work) and a pair of light (3-5 lb.) dumbbells, although I found a mat to be useful.

The Main Menu of the DVD offers options to either Play All or to select each of the four chapters individually. I have described each section of the workout in detail below.

Booty Barre Warm-Up (8.5 minutes)
This is a fast-moving, active warm-up with a bit of a cardio effect. Tracey starts with several variations on pli&eacute;s, adding in heel lifts and moving from a squat to a standing forward bend. There is also a bit of a dance-like element in swaying the hips from side-to-side. The final sequence includes a flow in and out of a yoga warrior 2 position, from warrior 2 to crescent lunge, and finally from plank to an inverted triangle, or down dog.

Booty Barre Sculpted Arms (10 minutes)
For the first half of this segment, Tracey quickly moves through some more traditional arms exercises, including side delt raise, overhead press, chest press, rear delt lift, and a unique side/rear delt raise which lifts out of a squat position. The second half focuses almost exclusively on triceps work, although it also includes a front delt raise and long biceps curl.

Booty Barre Workout (32.5 minutes)
This glute-focused segment is the heart of the workout; a chair is used throughout. In general, Tracey completes a series of exercises on one side, then does the same series with the second leg. For the first 12 minutes of this segment, the setup is sideways, with one hip facing the chair. Some of the pli&eacute;s here are similar to the warm-up moves, but the addition of kicks (from lunge and curtsy lunge positions) makes the work both more challenging and more glute-intensive. This first series concludes with a pulsing rear arabesque/attitude. The second 10 minutes also starts with the side to the chair in wide pli&eacute; for knee lifts. Tracey then performs a squat into a side leg lift, eventually pulsating and rotating towards the chair to change the emphasis from the hips to the glutes and back again, and finally, concluding with a killer ""stork"" kick. With just over 13 minutes left in this segment, Tracey introduces what she calls the ""cardio section."" Using the seat of the chair for balance, this approximately 4-minute segment involves standing in a runner's lunge and rapidly moving one knee in and out plus quick-moving plank variations (e.g., mountain climbers, bunny jumps). For the final standing sequence, Tracey returns to behind the chair for an assortment of moves, from parallel feet to additional pli&eacute;s to bent leg lifts (back and side). The best thing about this segment is that Tracey is constantly changing up the approach: just as you are starting to become too fatigued in one position, she switches to working the glutes from yet another angle.

Booty Barre Abs and Flexibility (12.5 minutes)
For this section, Tracey and crew begin standing on their knees, briefly lowering and raising from this position to work the core. After some push-ups/plank work, Tracey then performs a series of moves in a seated c-curve position. This is followed by more Pilates-inspired abs exercises, including both the single leg stretch and the single straight leg stretch. Tracey performs a very brief (about 1 minute) series of back extensions before moving into the final stretches. The 4-minute seated stretch sequence includes rock the baby, seated cross-legged forward bend, wide-legged seated forward bend, and wide-legged seated side bend; Tracey concludes standing.

One of the background exercisers, Laura, is designated as the modifier, but she actually shows very few modifications--although she doesn't go as deeply into the pli&eacute;s as Tracey, for the kicks, Laura is generally kicking higher than any of the other exercisers, including Tracey herself! This just underscores the fact that The Booty Barre is most appropriate for those at an experienced fitness level. The barre segment in particular is challenging in terms of both strength and stamina, as Tracey keeps you constantly moving, producing a strong cardio effect.

Tracey perhaps tried to do a bit too much in this DVD: at just over an hour (approximately 63.5 minutes total), the workout feels a bit long. She might have been better served by making the barre segment a bit shorter and by adding more lower-body focused stretching, which definitely felt lacking. Personally, I loved the arms work and the first 22 minutes or so of the barre section; in the future, I may only use the DVD through that point.

It is very challenging (for me - I am 66 yrs old) and every time I do this I want to achieve more. (Can I get that leg up higher?). (Can I do the arm routine with heavier weights?)

I have practiced with a barre and a chair. To be honest the chair works better.

The arm work is excellent as well. Increasing the weights adds to the challenge.

My only complaint is the ab routine, it is way too short. But then this is designed for the booty and legs more than anything else.

After the Abs section there is a very good flexibility section. Again a minor complaint, I would have preferred that this section had been separated from the Abs in order that it could have been selected from the menu without having to go through the abs first.

4267685,5,B0046BAAUE,"Just finished Tracey's Booty Barre workout !
I have 2 left feet so I am always concerned when I do a new workout. There was no concern with Tracey, her detailed instructions and her fun way of teaching is what makes me always want more.
I am feeling the burn now from all my muscles worked out, especially by legs and buns....but it hurts sooooo good.
You gave us another winner !",1295308800,2,380,4.291666666666667
4267686,5,B0046BAAUE,"I have been doing barre workouts for a few months, I own physique 57 and bar method. I was looking to add a new dvd to my routine and ran into the booty barre.

I did the workout yesterday and boy am I feeling it today. I wasn't able to get through all the kickboxing stuff but it's definitely something I can work up towards.

I agree with the other reviewer, the arm workout is one of the best when compared to other barre workouts.

Overall, your butt and legs will be sore the next day and Tracey is very pleasant to watch, has great form and excellent cues.",1293321600,12,562,4.137614678899083
