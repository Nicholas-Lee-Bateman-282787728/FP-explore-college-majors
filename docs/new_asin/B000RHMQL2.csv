8200745,4,B000RHMQL2,"I was bored and running out of cash at the time. The only anime I didn't have that I could afford was Air Gear. Air Gear is a pretty good show. I was quite surprised. It's more of an anime about beating up street gangs who just happen to ride roller blades with electric motors in them. I used to ride roller blades in middle school but I never associated it with being tough. These guys and girls really stick it to each other.

The main character, Ikki, lives with a family of sisters. He is a delinquent in a street gang. One day he finds a pair of ""At's"" in one of his housemates rooms. The story is about him climbing to the top of the AT battle world with his friends.

This series has a lot to offer. It has action, comedy, drama, and a bit of romance. Not as much as Ikki would like though. The animation is good and so is the soundtrack. It has a different kind vibe to it. It's very pop culture oriented and there is a descent amount of fan service. My only complaint with this one is that the whole roller blade thing is kind of lame. It's a bit of a strange premise to base an anime on. Even though the series is pretty entertaining, I wouldn't call it extremely memorable. There are many more animes out that are way better. If you've seen everything else go ahead and watch Air Gear, but check it out on Netflix or Youtube before you drop $20 on it.",1354665600,,1363,4.120300751879699
8200746,5,B000RHMQL2,Watch this anime if you have not done so already. This was a great series.,1245801600,,74,4.0
8200747,5,B000RHMQL2,Air Gear is a great series that hooks you in with a great story line and even better animation. The sly jokes and sweet action keep you locked in. I love the series and found it to be as good as gundam wing or outlaw star. The source material is good and this dvd is no exception. Wings reborn anti's up the action and story so you will love it even more. If you looking for a reason to buy the series this dvd is a great reason why you should buying it is well worth it.,1189814400,,471,3.865979381443299
