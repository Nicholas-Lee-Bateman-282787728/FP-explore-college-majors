5670919,5,B00BT0NPKW,"I just got back from a showing of this documentary. I went in not knowing a thing about Mumia other than being somewhat curious and ignorant about his place in popular culture. I came out teary-eyed, surprised to find out how internationally renowned and intellectually prolific this man is. There is a street named after this man in Paris (EDIT: actually, there are two streets named after this man in Paris!).

Mumia is a living figurehead of the modern civil rights movement, and we need to learn his story if we ever hope to move past the racial tension that has held back millions of men and women in the United States for so many years. He has been referred to as the ""Voice of the Voiceless."" Watch this to find out why.",1372291200,8,727,4.466165413533835
5670920,5,B00BT0NPKW,"""Long Distance Revolutionary"" is an excellent depiction of Mumia Abu-Jamal as the brave activist, eloquent journalist and admirable human being he truly is.  Unlike previous documentaries about Mumia Abu-Jamal, which focus primarily on his case, Stephen Vittoria's new film focuses on the life and work of Abu-Jamal himself -- and in so doing, shows the real motive of those who have tried to silence him forever.  Mumia Abu-Jamal is one of the finest minds of my generation -- a brilliant writer, commentator and media critic who was targeted for a hit by the Philadelphia police for reporting on police brutality, railroaded to a murder conviction for surviving the cops' attempt to kill him, and condemned to die in prison for his dissident politics.  I have not yet bought the DVD but have already seen ""Long Distance Revolutionary"" twice in theaters in New York City.  I urge all people who believe in the American promises of freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of association to watch ""Long Distance Revolutionary"" -- and support the struggle to FREE MUMIA ABU-JAMAL AND ALL U.S.-HELD POLITICAL PRISONERS!",1366329600,15,1129,5.119565217391305

5670956,5,B00BT0NPKW,"Mumia Abu Jamal: Long Distance Revolutionary is a magnificent artistic journey through Mumia's life. It spotlights his talent, brilliance, and perseverance in the face of insurmountable odds. It shows the absurdist Kafkaesque tragedy that our criminal justice system has become. A former Black Panther and a leftist journalist Mumia had a perspective that challenged the status quo and made his capture and silencing an imperative to the FBI and the Philadelphia police under the iron fist of Frank Rizzo. Filmmaker Stephen Vittoria brings out Mumia's humanity while never losing sight of the racial and class politics so intrinsic to Mumia's message of love to the world. Cornel West says Mumia is a long distance revolutionary because of his love for and dedication to humanity. He says Mumia is a bluesman to the life of the mind, and a jazz man of ideas. Vittoria makes these musical allusions vivid in the film. He does this under the severe constraints set by the Pennsylvania prison system. He was not allowed to film Mumia, yet managed to use stills and vintage footage to maximum effect. The audience comes away from the film knowing they have experienced a truly remarkable man. Vittoria tells us that Mumia is so remarkable Paris has designated him an honorary citizen, and St. Denis, France, the city of kings, has named a street after him.
This movie doesn't address the question of Mumia's actual guilt or innocence, but in a companion feature on the DVD , ""Manufacturing Guilt"", Vittoria shows how the evidence against Mumia was heavily fabricated. Fundamental police procedures such as testing for explosives on his hands that would indicate whether or not he had recently fired a gun were not done. At the same time a witness was coerced into giving a false confession which she later recanted. On appeal the evidence from Mumia's trial proved so flimsy, he was removed from death row after 30 years.",1376784000,2,1917,4.975077881619938
5670957,5,B00BT0NPKW,"This film was so much more than just a film about Mumia. To me was a film about any prejudice against a minority group, and the David and Goliath archetype. Here we find David in his cell on death row, with nothing further to lose than the promise that he has already lost his life and never knowing when the execution will come, throwing his carefully aimed and poetic treatises at the government that let him, and his people, down. Left me moved and reeling. What I loved was the details of the case were not dredged up and debated - there was little discussion of guilty or innocent. The film focused on Mumia the artist, a prolific artist continuing to create from the environment of death row for over 30 years. This movie was poignant, moving, and powerfully executed. Steve Vittoria is a filmmaker to watch, a fearless documentarian with a real mastery of his craft. I would absolutely recommend this documentary to all.",1375747200,,927,4.624242424242424
5670958,5,B00BT0NPKW,"Few films have had the kind of lasting impact on my thoughts that Long Distance Revolutionary has. By balancing an incisive reappraisal of Mumia's historical context with the kind of cunning artistic flourishes sorely missing from most political documentaries, director Stephen Vittoria is able to tell a story that will resonate with viewers across the entire sociopolitical spectrum. Unwilling to dole out easy answers, the film instead invites dialogue and, in the ultimate act of filmmaking integrity, insists on challenging audiences to think for themselves.

Mumia's story is, unfortunately, a familiar one. A bold new talent emerges from humble beginnings only to be marginalized and persecuted by the very institutions and communities he sought to heal. You don't have to agree with Mumia's politics in order to admire the man for his courage, insight, and deeply felt social obligations - and the same can be said for the film itself. I highly recommend this movie to everyone I meet not just for its capacity to inspire, but for its more central message that we should all hold ourselves and our society accountable to their true potential.",1375747200,2,1150,5.182795698924731
5670959,1,B00BT0NPKW,"To call ""Mumia - Long Distance Revolutionary"" a documentary is to do a great disservice to all true documentary filmmaking.  This is far-left, pseudorevolutionary drivel.  It is a typical straw-man deception that seeks to divert the viewer's attention from the undeniable fact that Mumia murdered a policeman because the policeman was going to write Mumia's brother a traffic ticket.  Mumia's guilt is so obvious and so overwhelmingly supported by the facts of the case that even the lawyers working on his behalf have largely ceased trying to ""prove his innocence"" and instead are relying on bait-and-switch tactics like this ""mockumentary.""  That Mumia has been an activist and a journalist and that people around the world seem to love him has nothing to do with the fact that he murdered a policeman over a traffic ticket.  Millions of people loved Hitler, and Charles Manson still receives countless fan letters in prison.  Mumia belongs in the company of those two men; not as a fraudulent symbol of a struggle for civil rights and ""giving voice to the voiceless.""  But that is all that the viewer receives in this whitewash film.  The film presents Mumia as a political prisoner; targeted and incarcerated by an Orwellian government that for some inexplicable reason ""fears"" him.  Is there no limit to the rubbish that some people will believe?  That his sentence has been reduced to life in prison is truly a miscarriage of justice.  This film is pure propaganda, and it is not very good propaganda at that.  Employing the tactics of failed sixties radicals (attaching ""celebrities"" to the man's cause, arguing that centuries of oppression led to these events, the evil government framed him, etc.), the film would be downright laughable if it were not for the fact that a man is dead.  That we have not heard the last from this thoroughly worthless person is a sad fact of the laws of this country and the pathetic obsession of the left, which is presented in vulgar surplus in this film.  To give it one star is infinitely more than it deserves.  Utterly devoid of facts, logical argument, objectivity, thoroughness and relevance; this film is a loser on all counts - rather like its subject.",1375401600,10,2202,4.9135135135135135
5670960,4,B00BT0NPKW,Very good documentary! Also brings back sad memories of the abuse of power by those who had an agenda in the 70s - 80s,1375401600,2,118,3.9583333333333335
5670961,5,B00BT0NPKW,"This new film by director Stephen Vittoria, whose previous film was an excellent documentary about George McGovern, is easily one of the most thoughtful and engaging political documentaries that I have seen in recent years. For three decades, while he was on death row (until late 2011), African-American activist and journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal had become widely known as an international symbol of the immoral nature of capital punishment in America, as well as of the pervasive institutional racism too often found throughout the U.S. justice system. Furthermore, Abu-Jamal, a former National Public Radio reporter and former president of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists, has been widely respected by many progressive readers for his continuing ability to write articles and books brimming with more social insight from within prison walls than most mainstream journalists are able to compose from the outside. But despite his international renown (including the controversy of that renown in conservative circles), not very much was commonly known about Mumia Abu-Jamal the person, or about the evolution of his world views. Through lively archival footage and through interviews with Abu-Jamal, with family and friends, and with some of our country's best progressive historians and political authors like Cornel West, Alice Walker, Amy Goodman, Michelle Alexander, Juan Gonzales, and former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, this terrific film provides a full and compelling portrait of Mumia Abu-Jamal's life story and places his history as an activist and journalist into the context of recent civil rights and human rights movements. Anyone interested in contemporary progressive politics or in modern liberation movements should not miss this important film!

The DVD version comes with a riveting 25-minute companion piece, Manufacturing Guilt, which makes the most comprehensive and persuasive case that I have seen for Abu-Jamal's likely innocence of the crime of which he was accused, the shooting in 1981 of a Philadelphia police officer. Manufacturing Guilt recounts the witness tampering, the withholding of exculpatory evidence, the lack of any physical evidence tying Abu-Jamal to the crime, and some near-certain lies by key police officers that were at the core of Abu-Jamal's original conviction. It also describes compelling new evidence that has come to light in recent years, including a witness who has come forward to say that he saw the shooter that night and it was not Mumia Abu-Jamal, a revealing re-examination of the original crime scene photos, and another man's actual confession to the crime. After watching this feature film and its companion DVD piece, I am more curious than ever to see what will happen next in Abu-Jamal's ongoing legal appeals process, now that his sentence was commuted in late 2011 from the death penalty to life without parole, and now that his legal team will have to continue to try to figure out how to get the courts to finally acknowledge that Abu-Jamal's original trial was grossly unfair, and that he deserves to be retried or freed.",1375315200,2,3120,5.380368098159509
5670962,5,B00BT0NPKW,"This documentary really speaks to the heart of Mumia, the man, the journalist and the revolutionary.  The film is masterfully put together and takes the viewer on a journey through Mumia's life - his childhood, his time with the Black Panthers and MOVE, his incarceration and life after. The film tackles issues of injustice, race and perseverance in a bold and impactful way and delivers a richly detailed portrait of a revolutionary who will not be broken!  The bonus feature ""Manufacturing Guilt"" goes into much more detail about the injustice of the trial and is a great addition to the DVD.  Buy it.  Share it with friends.  Watch it over and over.  A wonderful film.",1375315200,2,672,4.8
5670963,5,B00BT0NPKW,"I grew up in the Philadelphia area, and both of my parents were born and raised in Philadelphia as well, so I was more than familiar with Mumia's story.  That is - the one the media wants you to know.

I never really gave it much thought.  As a child and teen, I just assumed, rather ignorantly, that what I was told was true.  I also never understood why everyone was so interested in the case after so many years and a conviction had passed.  But as I grew, I was able to educate myself more, and in doing so my opinions changed.

The best documentaries are the ones that draw emotions.  If, afterwards, I don't feel angered or inspired or enlightened, then the doc and the filmmakers didn't do what they had intended.  There is nothing worse than a bad doc, but there is nothing better than a great one.  Long Distance Revolutionary: A Journey with Mumia Abu Jamal is a GREAT documentary.  It made me angry, it made me sad, and it made me what to run out of the movie theatre and DO something.

What I loved about the doc, besides it's ability to draw emotions from viewers, is that it told a story that we aren't familiar with.  If you're familiar with Mumia, then you know all about the case, so 2 hours worth of ""this-is-why-he's-innocent"" really wouldn't have swayed you one way or the other.  But Steve took a different, and I believe more powerful, route, to tell Mumia's story.  He showed us the Mumia that our media and government want to silence, and by doing so, Steve has given Mumia an even more powerful voice.",1374969600,2,1526,4.384341637010676
5670964,5,B00BT0NPKW,"Although this is a snapshot of a controversial and charismatic figure it speaks in a much larger way to our culture, politics, racism, and humanity. I loved this movie. I found it very inspiring and enlightening. It made me think beyond the shallow news bites we are all constantly being fed. The interviews are amazing and the narrative is compelling. This movie should be seen. Even by those who would argue with it's point of view. It is an intelligent and legitimate contribution to the higher discussion of who we are as a people and what our responsibilities are as citizens.",1374883200,9,581,4.762376237623762
5670965,5,B00BT0NPKW,"I saw ""Mumia: Long Distance Revolutionary"" in the theaters twice. In full disclosure, I helped work on it as well and so I was pleased to see the outcome. I was worried initially it would be too one sided. Instead, it did a neat trick of exploring and providing Mumia's words rather than dwelling on what so many people assume is the focus, the death of a policeman and the accusation that it was Mumia. The director wisely focused elsewhere in the movie-- letting actors, poets and political scholars speak Mumia's words. What I was left with was the spirit of a man who has created some of the most thoughtful prose on race & power, history, and politics in the US. It's also a great film to study on how to get a message across outside of the usual boxes that categorize how media traditionally treats subjects like this. Check it out!",1374883200,3,838,4.483660130718954
5670966,5,B00BT0NPKW,"After viewing the film in the theater I also wanted to own the DVD.

5670967,5,B00BT0NPKW,"I've long been fascinated by Mumia--his story, his words, his endurance. And if you want to track the particulars of his case and his wrongful imprisonment, there are many great pieces out there to watch. But if you want to meet Mumia and feel his power, this is the movie to see. It truly covers the ""long distance"" of an amazing revolutionary, and it does it by pushing the boundaries of the medium. We don't see documentaries like this one that merges literature, art, performance, history and storytelling into a snowball that rolls toward you, consumes you and leaves you flattened. In a good way.",1374796800,5,602,4.742857142857143
5670968,5,B00BT0NPKW,"MUMIA is not a typical ""whodunnit"" documentary which explores the criminal case, one of the most controversial in history, of former journalist Mumia Abu Jamal, but rather a telling portrait of the man himself and how he has used the past 30 years of his life, most of which were spent on Pennsylvania's Death Row, to fight for prisoner's rights, speak out on the prison industrial complex, and continue his life's work as a crusading journalist who is obsessed with justice, human rights and making the American Dream accessible for all Americans.

Many have slammed this film as a hagiography which ""glamourizes"" a convicted murderer, but nothing could be further from the truth. Please see this important film and make up your own mind about who Mumia is, what he has accomplished and where he is going, despite now serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison.
