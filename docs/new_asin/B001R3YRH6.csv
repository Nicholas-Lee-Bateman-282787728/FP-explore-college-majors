3772844,5,B001R3YRH6,"I own the other two Skinny Bitch DVD's, and I was very excited to learn about this one, as it is almost completely cardio.

The first thing I can say is that this is a really fun video.  I love to dance...I go dancing all the time, so I knew I would like this.  The second thing I can say is that you WILL get a good cardio workout.  I am not an easy person to please when it comes to working out...but when I was finished with this video I had an elevated heart-rate, sweating profusely and a great big smile on my face.

They don't promise to be professional dancers, and it's clear when they miss a few steps, but they just keep going, and you can tell they had fun while making the video.

This video will add to my exercise success...with Skinny Bitch Boot Camp I definitely feel the burn.  With Skinny Bitch Body, I can target individual areas (and because of this have already lost inches in my hips, thighs and belly--and that's after doing this video for 4 weeks).  With Skinny Bitch Booty Bounce, I get a fun cardio workout while being able to dance the fat & calories off my body.",1240272000,8,1091,4.211538461538462
3772845,1,B001R3YRH6,"This DVD workout is such a waste of time. Very uninspiring, they do not rotate using left and right sides of the body, can't count. I was so disappointed.",1373932800,,154,4.344827586206897
3772846,1,B001R3YRH6,"Absolutely terrible dvd, not taught by anyone that has rhythm or knows how to count, so it was frustrating to follow! I love that you ladies are all about your brand and having fun but it was so ridiculous, steps were gone over minimally and you missed an entire side of stretching in the beginning. Leave it to the pros, hire someone to do your dvd! Love you girls, but I can't work out to this!",1327968000,9,396,4.223684210526316
3772847,1,B001R3YRH6,"Wow! I was really excited by the title booty bounce!! I wanted to dance and be upbeat, but when I saw these too women speak and dance it became comical. They spoke like they were reading a SNL script, they didn't know how to count you in, created these ""homemade"" moves, made mistakes which they ignored, and they never switched sides to give your body an equal balance workout.  After this video I went to the gym for a 90min intense workout!",1325808000,2,443,4.402439024390244
3772848,1,B001R3YRH6,"Honestly, don't waste your time with these skinny bitches.  It's really starting to be a joke now.  What ""booty"" do they have to bounce anyway?  They can't dance, they are ridiculous and are entirely too hokey to be taken seriously.  SAVE YOUR MONEY and DON'T BUY this video.",1323907200,,275,4.666666666666667
3772849,1,B001R3YRH6,This video is a complete waste of money. There are no counts to change movements and the instructors don't seem to know where they're going to start a new move. It's all together a shabby and halfhearted attempt at a workout video.,1307923200,,231,4.523809523809524
3772850,1,B001R3YRH6,"I was very disappointed in this workout DVD.

1. Moves are not clearly described.  I was told to ""do the hustle"" and I'm sorry, but I don't know what that means.  A clear description of what movements were needed would have cleared that right up for me but we don't get that at all.  The angle of the camera shots make it difficult to really see what they're doing, which makes it even more difficult to pick up the moves.  The ""Pimp Walk"" was the WORST move for this- I was never able to really get it.  As the workout progressed, multiple moves were added on at one time with no warning, which was frustrating.

2. Bad camera work.  There were a number of shots that made it almost impossible to see what the instructors were doing with their bodies and as such, I had a hard time picking up the moves that, as was already mentioned, were not clearly described or defined for noobs who wanted to try out something different.

3. Cues were not clear.  Instructors would either not call out moves, not count off properly, would call out a movement before it was actually ready to start- the list is long here.  Because of some of the moves, I could not always look at the TV screen and the lack of proper cuing made it very difficult to stay with the routine.

4. No one was on the beat.  It was frustrating, as there was music playing but no one seemed to actually be working out to it.  The side step stuff was always off beat and I found that frustrating as well.  As a band geek who actually knows how to keep time, I had to grit my teeth through much of this workout.

5. This was not a challenging workout IN ANY WAY.  I barely broke a sweat but spent most of the DVD listening to the instructors talking about how ""difficult"" it was and how ""hard"" of a workout it was.  This was not hard in any way and I can't even really understand how any of the moves would have targeted any part of my body, let alone my ""booty"".  This was not a challenging cardio workout AT ALL.  I felt angry and frustrated afterwards and decided to go for a run just so I could actually break a sweat.  The whole thing felt like a waste of time.

I feel like I wasted almost an hour with this DVD- lots of time but very little result for that time.

I will confess that I am not a dancer.  I always wished that I was but I tend to be very rhythm-less.  I had hoped, based on the DVD box, that this would be something that I could follow and maybe learn how to move a little bit better.  Alas, I was wrong.

My only positive comments here are that I did like the two instructors, to a point.  They had fun personalities and they really brought a different vibe to the workout than most exercise instructors.  Unfortunately, their lack of training and (what I assume is) inexperience made it difficult for me to work out with them.

Two thumbs totally down.",1282608000,,2837,4.209647495361781
3772851,5,B001R3YRH6,"These discs keep you laughing and feeling good while you workout. If you have read the the Skinny Bitch book, it is time to get the DVDs.",1281484800,,137,4.111111111111111
3772852,1,B001R3YRH6,This has to be the worst work out DVD on the market.  The music is terrible and the steps are off beat.  The instructor is obviously taking steps from someone in the front right corner.  Maybe that person should have come out and teach.  These ladies should stick to writing books and avoid at all cost doing work out videos.  DO NOT WASTE your money.,1266624000,3,351,4.338461538461538
3772853,3,B001R3YRH6,"Not as pumped up as I thought it would be, wish there was more movement, not so much stopping!",1265760000,,94,4.0
3772854,2,B001R3YRH6,"Don't waste your money on this, unless if you're really good at picking up movements quickly. I had just gotten it in the mail yesterday, but sent it back today. This is definately for more advanced users. They move fast, and don't even break down to show you what you're supposed to do. If you're good at things like this -- I say, go for it ... but if not, don't even worry about it, because it wouldn't be worth it.",1264550400,,418,4.172839506172839
3772855,5,B001R3YRH6,"This is a really fun workout dvd. As always, the girls are hilarious and the dancing is really fun. I would recommend it to anyone, as it is really easy to do and easy to follow along with.",1264204800,,189,4.0
3772856,2,B001R3YRH6,"I was so excited to do this workout, and I was EXTREMELY disappointed.  The instruction is terrible,  they don't teach you the steps, they just jump right in to the dance moves (many that I have no clue how to do), and they don't count either, so I was LOST!

The music was terrible too!  If there was at least good upbeat music to go with the workout I would have been more inclined to get through the workout.

Bottome line... don't waste your money!",1264118400,,452,4.270588235294118
3772857,1,B001R3YRH6,"I got this for Christmas, and I'm so thrilled I didn't spend my money on it (and so sorry that my parents spent theirs).  It's like a really really bad version of a cardio funk class - without heart, without polish, without rhythm, and without giving you a workout.  The women are completely expressionless throughout the ""workout,"" so don't expect to be motivated by them.  They also seem to have never viewed a decent workout video before.  *I* could have done a better job.  Sorry, ""we're not professional dancers"" is no excuse for putting themselves out there as fitness instructors when they do such a terrible job.  They have no rhythm - though I have to believe that they filmed the whole thing without music and then tried to match up some pathetic music to it afterwards (""tried"" being the operative word).  Also, I am not in very good shape, but I couldn't even get my heart rate raised. Skip this dvd.",1262822400,2,912,4.592592592592593
3772858,2,B001R3YRH6,"This video is definitely different from any other workout program. It started out okay with a decent ballet warmup complete with their quirky comments and casual attitudes. Kind of a humorous, refreshing change - that was my first impression (and the reason it gets 2 stars instead of just 1).

Once the actual workout part began, however, I could not stand it. Their lack of rhythm made it absolutely unbearable. Otherwise, I probably could have dealt with the poor instruction and often no warning with regards to the moves.

Try Kathy Smith's stuff - it's quite good.",1257984000,10,570,4.865979381443299
3772859,1,B001R3YRH6,"It's probably not the fault of the presenters, but I found the workout video cheesy and barely worked up a sweat. The music didn't match the dance moves, it was more like elevator music. I do like their stance on animal rights though!",1254441600,,234,4.465116279069767
3772860,3,B001R3YRH6,This was ok.  I am going to sell my copy.  They don't properly explain how to do most of the moves.  I am not a dancer so I was lost pretty much the whole time.  I much prefer bootcamp or their body dvds.,1246233600,,204,3.6744186046511627
3772861,5,B001R3YRH6,I wish these Ladies were my BEST FRIENDS - I love the humor and fun of working out with them. I am a Skinny Bitch and Loving it!!!,1241740800,,130,3.6785714285714284
3772862,1,B001R3YRH6,"I rarely review items, but I hope to warn others who actually want a real workout not to waste their money, as I did, on this DVD.  I hate workout tapes that start with instructors who waste my time introducing themselves, their philosophies, and in this case, urging women to love their bodies.  For instructors who are really insistent on this, I prefer the ones who put ""Instructor Information"" as an option at the end of the video, as, for example, Jazzercise or even Tae Bo.  Fade out, fade in, and good grief, they introduce themselves again!  How dumb do they think we are?  They waste 4 minutes of my workout time with blah, blah, blah.

Their ballet-influenced warm-up supposedly is free flowing and they are to make up their own names for their moves, but as time goes on, they do use ballet terminology, but who cares?  NO CUEING!  EVER!!!  Throughout the who tape, no advance notice, no explanation, no correction or warnings of right or wrong ways to move.  After some swooping around, the bitches said we had just finished a really HARD ballet warm-up.  (Who did?  I sure didn't).

Next, they continued barefoot with the 80's jam or dance or whatever.  The music was uninspired and hard to hear, and the bitches had no sense of rhythm at all.  They appeared unable to count down to start a new set, and couldn't keep the beat throughout the whole set.  But my greatest concern was that during this higher cardio set, bare feet were maintained.  Hello!  You don't do ponies, 4 to the right and 4 to the left with bare feet!  Ever hear of shin splints?  Granted, that was about the highest cardio movement for that song.

The next uninspired dance was to be hip hop, and I couldn't stand it.  I was 30 minutes into this ""workout"" and wasn't even breathing hard.

The Skinny Bitches really know their stuff and veganism and nutrition!  No contest!  But Patrick Goudreau, you should be ashamed to be even associated with such a mess!  Shame on you!

Follow their diet if you are willing, but pass on this worthless ""workout""!",1240704000,36,2035,4.580555555555556
3772863,3,B001R3YRH6,"I love the book and the cookbook, so I was excited about the workout series. The DVD isn't very well designed. I tried to start the warm-up, but I got a whole lot of talking. I don't want to have to go through the into every time I want to work out. Once I got to the actual workout, I thought it was kind of nice that they weren't hard core physical trainers. But as the workout progressed, it began to get a little annoying because they didn't really count, or give you any lead in, into the next steps. Then as the moves got more complicated it was painfully obvious that they were watching someone off screen doing the moves.

I like Patrick Goudeau, and I have done his workouts before. The video would have been so much better if they had let Patrick teach the course and they were just on the screen with him.",1240617600,,816,4.197452229299363
3772864,5,B001R3YRH6,OK Rory is hilarious.  This was a really fun DVD for me I own the other 2 and really like them.  Very obvious the bitches are not pro dancers but I actually liked that because I am not either.  I recommend this because the steps build together into a comprehensive dance that is fun.  The repetition really helps you learn the steps.  It's a good workout - you have to think to get the steps but I like that.,1240444800,,408,4.113924050632911
8337238,2,B001R3YRH6,"I wanted to like this video, as I own the 2 other workout videos and they are great. This one is boring and somewhat corny. Alas, I cannot get a refund because I already watched it. Sorry, ladies this one is going in the archives :(",1501372800,,232,4.065217391304348
8337239,2,B001R3YRH6,"I worked up a sweat, but it was a mild one. Was under the impression that there would be some good music to jam to and a lot of shaking and bouncing similar to my MixxedFit classes, no such luck. Just typical workout music that you would find in an old school workout video. I like the attitudes of the girls though, good messages and not too annoying like some trainers can be - they might need a little more training to be trainers, but they are geared in the right direction.",1425945600,,478,4.206521739130435
8337240,3,B001R3YRH6,"It isn't what i thought, but I do enjoy the other DVDs",1425254400,,54,3.5833333333333335
8337241,5,B001R3YRH6,All of the Skinny Bitch line is great. Great workout and with some humor!,1417132800,,73,4.285714285714286
8337242,5,B001R3YRH6,"This DVD is GREAT! The two women hosts on here are HILARIOUS! You can really tell that they are friends by the way they banter. I have never laughed when working out before! Not only am I getting in shape I am having fun too, and that is really important!",1411430400,,255,4.12
8337243,1,B001R3YRH6,"I took this out of the library and am so happy I did not pay for it. The beginning starts with a ballet warmup. Nice? Not at all. They then tell you they do not know ballet or the names of the steps. Since they didn't know, I turned it off. Do not waste your money.  Amazon made me rate this and it does not deserve one star.",1399766400,,325,3.7794117647058822
8337244,3,B001R3YRH6,"It's a very low impact DVD, definitely not my favorite.
I think it might be good for people who are just trying to start exercising  or those who would like to move a little without sweating much :)
I bought it because i've read their book ""Skinny Bitch"" and LOVED it! And honestly if you follow the guiding principles of the book you will be in great shape without exercise or this type of low impact would be enough :)",1394841600,,420,4.25
8337245,1,B001R3YRH6,I never broke a sweat. gave it away.  I felt it was more of a comedy routine than a workout.,1394668800,,92,3.6
8337246,1,B001R3YRH6,"It was not horrible, but it was not that good either. I did not keep this one after one try.",1393027200,,92,3.65
8337247,1,B001R3YRH6,"It's very terrible. The two instructors like to talk way too much to each other and the main instructor has no rhythm and often times she's quite off beat from the music and it's very hard to follow. Plus, she randomly adds moves to the routine without warning and it's hard to keep up. I would not reccommed this workout!",1387065600,,322,4.383333333333334
