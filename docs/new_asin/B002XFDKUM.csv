4009027,5,B002XFDKUM,"In the avalanche of blablabla books and DVD's that we can find in each and every New Age store, here comes a touching, sincere and very personal effort to find the ""truth"" behind the phenomena that we all know so well.
Thinking of writing your uncle? and hey..the phone rings and there is your uncle calling. Cynical about how people can become cured from a severe disease without using medication or undergoing an operation? An impressive line-up of internationally famous scientists are trying to explain in this film how to investigate that there is indeed more between heaven and earth. There might not be a one SINGLE simple answer, but at least the viewer gets an unique insight in the experiments that are being executed to find some of these answers...
I rate this a much better DVD than ""What the Bleep"" which was a roller coaster computer ride. Unlike Bleep, this is educational stuff and should be used at universities and is obliged study stuff for everyone interested in para-psychological subjects.

4009035,5,B002XFDKUM,"Anyone into parapsychology will have a delightful time with this DVD.
Anyone not into parapsychology will have a tough time explaining themselves.",1381622400,2,146,5.681818181818182
4009036,5,B002XFDKUM,I really enjoyed this very much . It opens one's perception of a far greater universe of which we are part. Very inspiring .,1378512000,2,124,4.208333333333333
4009037,5,B002XFDKUM,"The movie offers a captivating and lucid tour de force of the exploration of the extraordinary human capacities which are our birthright, and of our interconnectedness with one another and the Universe. It provides evidence for the unity, causal efficacy and non-locality of consciousness, with profound interviews of many of the greatest parapsychology pioneers and healers, and some great scenes of experiments and healings. It reviews many of the key experiments performed and insights achieved on this important subject over the past decades and offers an outline of a new paradigm in which the extraordinary becomes ordinary, and which offers us much greater freedom and power, ans well as the foundation for a better life, individually and collectively. A movie important for our time in which these extraordinary capacities are emerging like never before in the history of our culture, and stand to play an essential role in human evolution and transformation. Highly recommended for anyone interested in human potential, transformation, and science and spirituality, for beginner and expert alike.",1375488000,4,1105,5.5058823529411764
4009038,3,B002XFDKUM,"OK movie, some parts are better than others  Probably more interesting if you are ""newer"" to this type of subject.",1355788800,2,114,4.7
4009039,2,B002XFDKUM,More Kreskin than Hawking... now the review requires me to type more words. Unfortunately I can't come up with any to improve on my review.,1354579200,5,139,4.6
4009040,4,B002XFDKUM,"I really liked this DVD because it gives hard evidence for paranormal perceptions - things like ESP, Brain Radar, telepathy-- real hard core testing done by real scientists under controlled conditions. No faking, no hoaxes.  The DVD ran a bit long, thus not five stars-- but an excellent documentary that I thoroughly enjoyed and can highly recommend.",1336435200,4,351,5.157894736842105
4009041,1,B002XFDKUM,"The documentary starts with a magician bending a spoon which he obviously does behind his back before putting it in his palm to bend.  There is no definitive evidence presented in defense of paranormal abilities.  Why does the phenomena defy scientific scrutiny?  Or a better question, why make a movie when you have no good evidence and nothing new to say?  You will not find anything here you haven't seen before elsewhere.

The made-for-tv quality documentary is advertised as widescreen but it only looked right in fullscreen mode.  And worse, the different film clips were in differnt ratios so there is no one mode where everything will look correct.  I've lost my respect for Dean Radin and the Noetic Sciences Group.  I got this to invite some friends over to watch it but canceled after watching it alone since it is too boring.",1328745600,17,837,4.804195804195804
4009042,5,B002XFDKUM,This is a well made movie with lots of good insights and an upbeat first person feel. I highly recommend!,1328572800,,105,4.3
4009043,1,B002XFDKUM,"DISAPPOINTED!  I disagree with the high reviews this video has received.  The item is far from what it purports to be; it does not reveal original ideas, and is nothing more than a boring presentation of what the average person already knows (the same regurgitation coming up over and over), deserving to be removed from circulation.  There is no startling discovery about anything meaningful in this DVD, lacking in substance and innovation, although the simpletons (no disrespect intended) might disagree.  I bought this item because of its many positive reviews posted online.  Unfortunately, the purchase has been a bad investment for me in that I expected a lot more, but what I received is of no benefit or value whatsoever, knowing what I know about the subject matter covered in the film.  I sincerely don't think this video is worth the money it is selling for, if it is worth anything, and I would not recommend it to anyone.  Needless to say, I bought at my own risk, expecting to receive something innovative and useful, but what I got is not what I was led to believe it would be.  Buy at your own risk.",1328572800,24,1116,4.687179487179487
4009044,3,B002XFDKUM,I was disappointed with this. It may be good for someone who only has basic knowledge but I was looking for something more. I felt like it was the same stuff being rehashed over and over. Knowing what I know now I would not have bothered to buy this. I learned little that was new to me.,1316649600,15,287,4.052631578947368
4009045,5,B002XFDKUM,"I bought this item fully expecting it to have at least some amount of new age slant on it, or perhaps some hokey attempt to make it seem like it was taking an objective viewpoint, while all the while making many assumptions along the way. I was very pleasantly surprised to find a very objective film however, and in fact, was surprised instead at the fact that the filmmaker does such a good job of staying away from drawing any conclusions, or even trying to lead the viewer to do so.

This is a very interesting film with a significant amount of very interesting experimental evidence. It left me wondering after I finished watching it, and that to me is a good thing. Highly recommended.",1314835200,16,691,4.528
4009046,5,B002XFDKUM,"This is one of those movies I had to tell all my friends about, I've even talked about it with people I don't know. Just loved seeing the science--the actual reproducible experiences in a lab--on parapsychology, finally, instead of just the assertions and the anecdotes. I also bought and read The ESP Enigma, which offers a much deeper look at some of these topics and explores the non-locality of consciousness much more thoroughly.",1308700800,12,434,4.958904109589041
4009047,5,B002XFDKUM,"Scientific evidence exists for telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychokinesis & psychic healing... and it's fun to watch! Film-maker Rene Scheltema set out to find explanations for some seemingly inexplicable experiences she and her daughter encountered, treating us to a fairly comprehensive summary of some of the most current scientific findings in the field of consciousness today.

This documentary brings us into the homes and offices of some of the world's most thoughtful and well-spoken authors and visionaries who earn a living exploring the place where science and spirit meet... a place which can at times be frustrating to accurately describe, as its very existence challenges us to expand previous limits and boundaries of our ways of sensing, thinking, and knowing what is true. Interviews with Edgar Mitchell, Dr. Larry Dossey, Dean Radin, Hal Puthoff, Charles Tart, Rupert Sheldrake, Gary Schwartz, Jack Houck, Nancy Myer, Erik Pearl and Arielle Ford are artfully interspersed with footage depicting what is being discussed.

I love the way this film includes footage of Oscar the cat, who knows when people are about to die, and John of God in Brazil, conducting psychic surgeries and miraculous healing. Examples are shown of remote viewing, spoon bending, dogs who know when their owners are coming home, people proving experimentally that they can correctly guess twice as well as mere chance would allow who is calling them on the phone, and people reacting in advance to pictures they have not yet viewed. I loved seeing the PEAR (Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research) experiments, and some of the current work being done at IONS (the Institute of Noetic Sciences).

While a precise explanation for ""What is going on here?"" may still elude us, this film includes some possible theories such as Rupert Sheldrake's concept of morphogenic fields, and zero point energy. There indeed seems to be some kind of mechanism allowing for ""emotional futures to leak backward,"" as Dean Radin observes, and each and every one of us has access to the tools such as meditation, dreaming, and dancing that allow us to focus and then release our attention in ways that allow unconscious psychic senses to come forward into our consciousness, so we can experience how it feels to transcend time and space.

Viewing this amazing movie left me feeling tremendously uplifted, inspired, and energized. This is a DVD to share with family, friends, and everyone who may not realize just how much evidence exists for telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychokinesis and psychic healing. Truly fabulous!",1301616000,35,2614,5.306763285024155
4009048,5,B002XFDKUM,"When talking about psi phenomena, I am okay with ""woo-woo"" (the touchy-feely stuff), but I can do fine without it as well. This DVD had really good production values: lighting, sound, background, voice-overs, etc all were all of high quality. This was a surprise given what appeared to be a low budget production. The content was good, too. The interviews covered a good balance of material and tried to present sci phenomena in as unbiased a light as possible, though it is clear (to me) from the outset that it is pro psi. Definitely suggest you look at this DVD if you want to feel more ""scientifically grounded"" in your beliefs about our natural sixth sense abilities.",1299801600,14,672,4.752136752136752
4009049,4,B002XFDKUM,"Nicely made, a movie to broaden ones mind. God to hear that proven scentist's talk about 'paranormal' things, wich common people still deny. hopefully more and more of mankind will be able to raise conciousness.",1299542400,7,211,5.057142857142857
4009050,5,B002XFDKUM,"Great Video.
very informative.
stays on topic with each section of the video.
lots of ""real"" science not ""pseudo"" science so good food for thought.

Good for anyone with questions about the untangle forces and how they are effecting them or those around them.

some of the experiments and their results if you stop and think about the implications are mind boggling.... or opening depending on where you are.",1298592000,12,408,4.898550724637682
4009051,5,B002XFDKUM,"There are only a handful of films that treat this subject in a thoughtful and serious manner and this is one of them.  The filmmaker does a good job providing the viewer with a historical backdrop of Psi phenomena and research while also exploring some of the most important work happening in the field today.  Although the subject matter is addressed with an appropriately objective and scientific sensibility, the film itself has a very personal feel and the filmmaker finds a good balance between skepticism and open-mindedness, an approach that will feel comfortable for most viewers not already intimately aware of this amazing phenomena.  I wish there were more films out there like this one.",1290384000,14,698,5.052173913043478
4009052,5,B002XFDKUM,I have watched this video three times already. It has helped in my spiritual and healing path.,1286064000,7,94,4.588235294117647
4009053,5,B002XFDKUM,"I highly recommend viewing this very thought provoking doco on psychic phenomena.
It's one that I will definitely watch again and pass on to friends for a viewing, as well.
The DVD has interviews with some of my favourite authors, such as Dean Radin, Charles Tart, Rupert Sheldrake, Larry Dossey, plus many others, too.
It won't give you all the answers (if any), but it will give you a lot to think about and isn't that what life is all about...thinking???",1285372800,6,457,4.654320987654321
4009054,5,B002XFDKUM,"I'm a biased source, as I was the main scientist guiding the producer in making this video, and I appear on camera several times.  After subtracting these little ego satisfactions, though, I rate this video as excellent!
The usual video dealing with parapsychology is sloppily inaccurate, full of fantastic stuff that is probably nonsense, or both.  This one is highly accurate in depicting what we actually know and are investigating, presents it in a clear and exciting manner, and doesn't go off into ridiculous exaggerations or the opinionated mouthings of the psi-deniers who actually know nothing about parapsychological research but are sure it must be wrong.
So I recommend this as the best you can get for parapsychology and some of its implications for understanding human nature and spirituality.",1278288000,109,807,5.248062015503876
4009055,4,B002XFDKUM,"If you liked the movie What the Bleep, you'll enjoy Something Unknown Is Doing We Don't Know What.  Renee Scheltema goes on a search for answers to lifes puzzling questions and the proof that supports the answers.  It's really interesting to see the people and learn about the research occurring in quantum physics today.  Dr. Larry Dossey, Dr. Charles Tart and others quietly go about their work and strive to present scientific evidence of telekinesis, telepathy, premonitions (predicting the future), etc.  For the most part, I think there is compelling evidence presented in the movie to make people think outside of the box and open their minds to the possibility that there is more to energy than petroleum.  I liked the movie very much.  This would be a great one to show to a group and open up for discussion afterwards.  I'd like to see the movie on the big screen and hope theatres will pick this up soon.  Thanks Renee for giving a new twist on some age-old questions.",1273881600,33,979,4.7176470588235295
4009056,2,B002XFDKUM,"Had a few good information points, but its not a dvd I will keep in my library. It was pretty boring.",1271980800,8,101,3.857142857142857
4009057,5,B002XFDKUM,"Have you ever had experiences like: Reading someone elses mind?
Knowing who calls, when the phone rings? Did you have visions or dreams
that came true? Have you experienced miracles? The power of a prayer
from deep within your heart? And did you wonder, how and why?

This documentary gives profound and fascinating insights into the science
behind those psychic phenomena. Well known scientists talk about their researches.
You learn about the ""BIG 5"":

Precognition, Telepathy, Clairvoyance, Psychokinesis and Healing.

I have been reading many books and have seen lots of spiritual films,

8383653,4,B002XFDKUM,"In general, I try to find a balance between being open-minded versus gullible, and viewing a program on alleged parapsychological phenomena certainly requires that kind of balance.  If any of these phenomena are real, that has profound implications for our understanding of reality.  But are any of them real?  Frankly, you can't judge from this program at all.  This program describes the phenomena, and describes the kind of supposed evidence for the phenomena, but it doesn't present any of the evidence at a level of detail that enables its evaluation.

Can we at least say that some of these phenomena may be plausible?  I think the answer is yes.  Aside from anecdotal evidence (including an 'odd' experience I personally had, many years ago), we already know from our 'modern' physics developed over the past century (quantum nonlocality, the measurement problem, twin paradox, energy-mass interchangeability, etc.) that reality is far stranger than we ordinarily suppose.

Overall, I would say that this program offers a good introductory presentation of some intriguing possibilities - I watched it twice - but viewers will need to go beyond it in order to evaluate the evidence and draw their own conclusions.",1478995200,,1219,5.2153846153846155
