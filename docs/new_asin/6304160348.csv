796389,5,6304160348,"5 5 5 5 5 STARS GOLD NO GREATER, IT'S FILMIC PLATINUM!
That is all I can say about this powerfully gripping postmodernistic struggle in which entire world's collide, semiotic dimensions collapse, and THE FRIGGIN' UNIVERSE IS FLUSHED WITH CARELESS ABANDON LIKE MILK DOWN A DRAIN. Citizen Kane. I saw it. It ... NOTHING CAN COMPARE TO THIS FILM WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF GYMKATA but that's like comparing God to Jesus. They are one in the same, and both ARE EXCELLENT chefs. I think that this film should be the staple of every ""INDIE FILM BUFF'S"" library, with it's undercurrents of existentialistic philosophical squabblings, Rousseaunistic Individualism expressed in a cunning Boroque style, and DALI SURREALISM ETCHED FOREVER INTO THE PALLET OF MY MIND'S EYE. Hakim Bey and his band of roaming Ontological Anarchists (circa 1985) would be PLEASANTLY PLEASED AND EQUALLY PLUMP WITH THE FATTY JUICES OF SUCH A MASTERPIECE IN FILM AND ACCORDIAN TECHNOLOGY.
GOLD!",1041811200,,966,5.159235668789809
796390,1,6304160348,This movie utterly blows.  I think that i would have rather had a route canal than watch this movie.  If a mexican is here they need to (1) know friggin' english and (2) be legal.  If they cant meet one of both of these then they need to go back.  This movie stirs up compassion for illegal immigrants which is so falso.,1019520000,2,320,4.112903225806452
796391,1,6304160348,"I'm not a Spanish expert, but i understood almost all of the words in the movie.  When I first saw the movie, I was bored first, then I thought about how they portray the average Mexican.  Almost every person in the little community, which I doubt even exists, is an illegal immagrant.  One of the main characters even has a mullet.  I gave a quick, little chuckle at that notion.  Note, putting a LA Dodger hat on a Mexican, DOES NOT MAKE HIM AMERICAN.  I would think that if a young aged person would walk out of that movie feeling that every Mexican that lives in the south west, is an illegal immagrant.  They also get the immprssion that they reeked of foul odor.",1010102400,3,668,4.338709677419355
796392,5,6304160348,"I watched Sweet 15 in my high school Spanish class and loved it.  The drama pulls you in and the plot twist keep you glued to the tv. I could not wait to find out if she got the party or the guy, but lets just say that  this movie left me completly satisfied. A must see for any serious movie  buff.",949276800,2,299,3.7903225806451615
796473,5,6304160348,Great movie!,1421366400,,12,5.5
796474,4,6304160348,I use this video in my Spanish I class.  Great for Socratic seminars. The immigration issues raised in this video are still applicable today.,1418688000,,141,4.875
796475,5,6304160348,Very engaging for teenagers.,1416787200,,28,6.25
796476,5,6304160348,"This movie is a great family movie. All my granddaughters like to watch it, and one is now doing community service. She was inspired by the movie.",1414108800,,146,4.444444444444445
796477,5,6304160348,This is a great movie and is appropriate.,1405296000,,41,4.25
796478,5,6304160348,"A wonderfully acted and perfect movie for Junior High level students, and teachers, of Spanish and Social Studies.  The movie combines two stories:  The Hispanic cultural tradition of the ""Quinceaera"" and the historically, recurring theme of illegal immigrants living in the USA.  Students learn about ""amnesty"" in the 1980's (this can be applied to present day issues in the US).  Through the main character, 15 year old Marta, students should see a connection between selfishness and the importance of loyalty to one's family.  Another underlying theme that could be discussed after viewing is ""bullying"".
  Lesson plans pertaining to the movie's themes could be connected to common core standards for higher order thinking for the middle school student.",1404691200,,756,5.410256410256411
796479,4,6304160348,"I used to show this to...surprise, my Spanish classes. Its a bit corny, but still good! Not the best cultural representation but still pretty good.",1402963200,,147,4.92
796480,5,6304160348,still relevant deals with immigration problems with one family who is both American and Mexican.  The kids love this movie.,1371686400,,123,5.15
796481,4,6304160348,"It was in perfect shape. I could not see the entire film case due to stickers  from a library or something, however.",1366502400,,116,4.2727272727272725
796482,5,6304160348,"The sound and picture quality are good. Even though the clothes and some other details are dated, the story has many lessons about culture, self-identity, discrimination, forgiveness, and family relationships, and other aspects. Having been produced for WonderWorks, this show is very careful about keeping the words and action family-worthy while still getting the point across. The background music includes quite a bit of fabulous acoustic guitar work, which also makes this worth watching over and over.",1364428800,4,507,5.597402597402597
796513,5,6304160348,"I am an AP Spanish teacher for Middle School and my kids just loved and enjoyed this movie. It tells a lot about Hispanic culture, and how we celebrate our ""sweet 15"" or Quinecaneras fiesta. My students had a great time, worksheet esay to create, you can use thinking maps to compare and contrast cultures. It is a good item to have in class if you teach Spanish (any level)",1307145600,,374,4.357142857142857
796514,4,6304160348,"I first saw this movie in middle school and then again in high school. I enjoyed it very much, and had a hard time finding it. It's pretty expensive, but good luck finding it anywhere else. Anyway, I think this film is very good to show in schools, so that kids from non-Latino cultures can become more familiar with the Latin-American/Chicano culture. Students can get a glimpse of what Latinos hold valuable, and learn about the struggles they suffer, most notably the issue of immigration, by watching this movie. It's pretty entertaining as well. As for the product itself, for some reason it only worked on one of my DVD players. I don't know why, but hopefully it's just my DVD player that has trouble. Other than that, I strongly recommend this product.",1296691200,2,760,4.7218045112781954
796515,1,6304160348,"Sweet 15 was shown in 3 parts in my son's junior high Spanish class.  When I heard about the subject matter, I went to the school to watch it.

I was appalled that this film would be shown in school!  It's theme was supposed to be about quinceaera, but the real theme was how the girl's father was in the US illegally(breaking the law)and now needed signatures of past employers to fill out his amnesty papers (the teacher explained amnesty was forgiveness for breaking the law as long as you were employed the whole time you were here in the USA).

The girl's father could not get in to see his supervisors at his past jobs in the lawn mowing, fence building, restaurant, junkyard and trucking industries because of horribly rude and racist white people (Not to mention the rough treatment by immigration officers during a raid).

When the 15-year old daughter took it upon herself to help her father and go to the employers herself for the signatures, she was faced with bigots like a white junkyard owner saying, ""How should I know if he ever worked here?  I've got alot of wetbacks working for me and they ALL look alike!""

Of course the young girl softened the owner's heart by shaming him and reminding him that signing her father's amnesty papers was the right thing to do.

This movie was a slap in the face to white people; it insulted Mexican-Americans and all immigrants who have worked so hard to come to this country LEGALLY through the system.

Sweet 15 had NO place in a school classroom. Its message was that it's ok to break the law (as long as you are working) and all would be forgiven.  Not the right message for our young people.",1225843200,4,1650,4.506711409395973
796516,4,6304160348,I showed this movie in my Spanish 2 class. Although it is a bit old -- 80s clothes and hair! -- they still enjoyed it. It also really made them think about immigration. We also talked about the importance of the quinceaera in the life of a young latina woman.,1194825600,,259,4.2
796517,5,6304160348,"This is one of my favorite movies. I really enjoy it. I buy copies for people I love because it is a great movie, that is if you like bilingual movies and classics.",1193443200,,164,4.0
796755,2,6304160348,"This movie is a poor look into the lives of illegal immigrants. It's very stereotypical and it makes our immigration people look bad. The acting was also really bad, and no one knew how to show real (seemingly) emotion. The script didn't help either...and the casting was bad. Oh well, I just hope a better movie comes out for this sometime!",1139961600,,341,4.60655737704918
796756,5,6304160348,"This film is great. Karla Montana (""Stand and Deliver""),
and Tony Plana (""An Officer and a Gentleman""), Jerry Stiller (George Costanza's dad on ""Seinfeld"", Kevin James father in law on ""King of Queens"") and Susan Ruttan (Artie's secretary on ""LA Law"") are fantastic in this 1990 film. It does not look dated, (OK, there are some great mullets!) but the themes are timeless...coming of age, first love, second generation teen struggling against first generation parents, themes specific to latinos such as illegal immigration, quincea&ntilde;eras, amnesty. It's all here and it all works. I have bought it for myself and my sister, purchased one for our middle school library and loaned it out to countless friends. They all loved it. Great for classrooms learning about other cultures, also social studies, it brings up some great issues. I highly recommend it!",1095897600,3,861,5.201438848920863
796757,5,6304160348,"I am a Spanish teacher in Florida, where Spanish is prevalent.  We always show this video after presenting the ""family"" chapter.  The clothing may be dated, Ramn may seem a little ""old"" for Marta, but other experiences lend a lot of validity to being a teenager, not just a ""quinceaera"".  This video kept my students' attention, and that says a lot.  They followed every conversation.  They were especially involved in the dinner scene when Marta and her father had words.  I could hear them talking about what their own father would have done.(smile)  Not one of my students complained about it.  They learned what ""migra"" meant, and they learned a bit about the harsh reality of being from Mexico and coming to the USA to make a living.  One message was not to take so many things for granted.",1076371200,12,795,4.661870503597123
7863378,5,6304160348,Such a well done film.  A few symbolic references to watch out for... The lipstick at the beginning of the movie... The railroad tracks represent the crossing from childhood to adulthood....,1525132800,,190,5.129032258064516
7863379,5,6304160348,"Great for my beginning Spanish classes at the middle school level. Kind of cheesy, but still touching and enjoyable.",1488326400,,116,5.157894736842105
