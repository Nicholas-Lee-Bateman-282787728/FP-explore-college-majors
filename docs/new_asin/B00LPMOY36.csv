8667684,5,B00LPMOY36,"The best of the MST3K style shows. Rick Wolf, Johnny Cylon and Topsy Bot 5000 riff on some of the worst movies and short films ever. Their skits between showings add to the fun. Watch ICWXP, or Soapy the Germ Fighter will visit you in your sleep!",1450396800,,246,4.25531914893617
8667685,5,B00LPMOY36,"""Who the HELL do these a**holes think they are?!?"" I thought when I first discovered ICWXP. Being one of the few Brits to have discovered the joys of MST3K (and therefore feeling part of a very exclusive group) I assumed that this was just going to be an unfunny, amateurish low rate rip off. Well, apologies to Rikk, because as soon as I saw 'Soapy the Germ Fighter' I knew that I was the one being an a**hole.

The best way I can describe how I feel about this show is to compare it to the UK and US versions of 'The Office'. Started in the UK with it's own VERY specific group of characters and situations, got sold overseas and yes, for a while you think 'This is all a little too familiar', some same beats and situations and then you realise that although the characters were certainly inspired by Tim, Gareth, Brent, etc they are actually becoming their own people with their own arcs and personalities and it branches off on it's own and stops being a copy VERY quickly. Then, before you know it, THESE new characters are just as important as those you met all those years ago on UK TV and the show acknowledges that both co-habit the same universe!

This is more than just a homage to a much loved and much missed show. The production standards are high, it is well lit, shot, written, directed and acted and the laughs are genuinely trouser worrying! I sure as hell recommend watching this (and then ordering the rest) and Soapy the Germ Fighter is a great place to start. When fans give you such a high quality alternative to a show you loved dearly only a fool would pass it by. But, as I said above, Rikk should also be praised for making this show special and much loved in its own right.",1407801600,2,1702,4.349056603773585

If a person happens upon this product randomly the description of the episode above does not give the reader the full story of what Incognito Cinema Warriors XP is all about ...

Incognito Cinema Warriors XP is a direct to dvd series which some have said takes the Mystery Science Theater 3000 concept to the next level ...

The basic idea of Incognito Cinema Warriors XP is that the show chronicles the [mis]adventures of a soldier named Rick Wolf who was in command of a CORPS (Command of Reanimate Processing and Suppression) unit that dealt exclusively with combating zombies. After a pitched battle with many reanimated corpses Rick found himself the last survivor and thus he hauls ass out of there and finds refuge in the dilapidated Cine-A-Sorrow Theater..

In the theater lobby Rick meets Johnny Cylon the usher bot and the mobile concession stand known as Topsy Bot 5000. Zombies break into the theater lobby and our heroes flee into Theater 6. Our heroes soon find out they must comment on movies, shorts and advertising sent to them via their captor or the zombies will be let into the whole theater complex. The captor is at first the mad owner of the theater [Dr Blackwood] then an evil guy named Special Agent Jonathan Kincaid who is involved with the Ludivico Corporation and as of episode 201 is the automated film library computer [set in motion by Kincaid].

Episode 202's subject is a hygiene short entitled ""Soapy The Germ Fighter"". Soapy is a ghostly mascot of good cleaning habits whom is a walking bar of soap who apparently wears no pants. Soapy helps a boy go from filthy to clean in no time flat.... and Rick, Johnny and Topsy are there to provide a running commentary on this frightening short film. The blurb in the description for this release tells the reader of this title's info about what happens to some degree with the characters when they aren't riffing the short so I won't repeat that ...

Johnny, Topsy, Rick and another robot called Flux interact with themselves .... [and] the outside world [as noted above by the writer of the blurb for this dvd release], minions of an evil corporation and a special guest during the time that is not spent in the theater ....

After all the rambling text that I've just subjected a reader to I am finally getting to a review. It is fun to see these characters interact in and out of the riffing portion of this episode. The group dynamic is great....

The riffing is top notch ... it ranges from comments on what is happening on the screen for the most part and is sprinkled with pop culture references. The non riffing portions of episode 202 are very funny  as well.

By the by keep in mind the official content warning when thinking about letting the youngsters under 14 view the an ICWXP video CONTAINS MILD TO STRONG LANGUAGE, SARCASTIC ROBOTS AND SOME ADULT HUMOR.

So what more can I type but try out this episode and the others asap .......",1405468800,4,3042,4.625231910946197
8667687,5,B00LPMOY36,No seriously. Buy this DVD. These guys are the real deal. MST3k is done. Gone. These guys have taken up the riffing mantle and deserve it. Buy this DVD and donate money to the show at ICWXP.com. They need your help to keep the funny flowing.,1405468800,,241,4.260869565217392
8667688,5,B00LPMOY36,"People say that 5 star review systems skew ratings by encouraging people who already like a product or service to lazily give something what is effectively a ""thumbs up"" without creating anything approaching useful information that the uninitiated can use to determine if said product of service is worthy of their ever decreasing supply time and discretionary income.

I contend that those people have never watched an episode of Incognito Cinema Warriors XP, and will likely be the first ones up against the wall when the revolution comes.",1405468800,2,541,5.1477272727272725
