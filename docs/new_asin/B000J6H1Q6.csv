8149335,5,B000J6H1Q6,"This dvd Rant, with selections by Rumi, Bly, Neruda Langston Hughes is the treasure of my dvd collection. Hardly a day passes when I don't listen to one of the selections, and I highly recommend this dvd. There's that sad meditative emptiness juxtaposed with the joys and energy of childhood,the stirrings of the heart and the hopes of a new life all rolled into this ""Who speaks words with my mouth"". Buy it. It will move you again and again.",1211068800,2,443,4.55
