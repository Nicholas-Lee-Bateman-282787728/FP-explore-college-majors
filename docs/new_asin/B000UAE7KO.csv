2919166,4,B000UAE7KO,"This is an absolutely terrific movie. It doesn't do anything huge, doesn't make any major statements, and is, at its heart, a fluffy bit of redemptional escapism. But, thanks to two extremely compelling central performances, a solid supporting cast and some gorgeous direction, ""You Kill Me"" becomes a memorable and totally worthwhile movie, and the whole is something altogether stronger than the sum of the parts.

Frank Falenczyk (Kingsley) is the alcoholic hitman of B-List Polish mafioso Roman Krzeminski (Baker Hall). When he ties one on and misses his job to off Roman's main rival, Irish ganglord Edward O'Leary (Farina), Roman sends Frank to San Francisco to get sober, where, with the help of shady realtor Dave (Pullman), AA Sponsor Tom (Wilson) and the slightly off-kilter Laurel (Leoni), makes some definite progress into rediscovering his life, his job and his fate as a sober man.

Ben Kingsley's far too underused in films these days, and here's the proof: the character of Frank doesn't get many lines, or a particularly deep back-story, but in Kingsley's masterful hands is transformed from stock B-movie bad guy into a human being. Kingsley's weirdly shut-in reading of the character makes for a more human hitman, particularly while Frank's working in the morgue, in the AA meetings, or scenes shared with Laurel. Tea Leoni is fantastic here, her bubbly OTT-ness the perfect foil for Kingsley's underplayed Frank. And with great supporting cast turns from Bill Pullman and Luke Wilson, You Kill Me's somewhat thin script becomes a feast of idiosyncratic characters and memorable scenarios.

John Dahl's direction is great - pared-down and minimalist, there's not a shred of the glamorous complexities of more familiar Mafia movie territory, heightening the plausibility of Frank's San Francisco life. There's great visual comedy to be had in the AA Meeting scenes, and there's a sequence where a drunk Frank dances with ""some little Irish people"" that conveys a great sense of being very, very drunk.

All-in-all, ""You Kill Me"" is a great movie - it's not very laugh-out-loud funny, and doesn't have the most original story in the world, but is instead a well-made picture driven by its nicely-realised characters.

2919167,4,B000UAE7KO,"If you see a comedy this summer, this is it. In a summer of blow-up blockbusters and sequels, this is the first light comedy mob story that will have you at the edge of your seat and smiling on your way out of the theater. Don't let that fool you: inside the movie is a truly depressing commentary on today's modern woman. Tea Leoni plays a desperately lonely gal, who is ready to get involved with a man 25 years her senior, who is an alcoholic and a hitman. The only thing that worries her is an eligible guy's potential to be gay; everything else she is willing to overlook. Why is this gorgeous woman settling? Because she's lonely, Ben Kingsley's character explains. This movie would fall apart in a heartbeat if it wasn't for Leoni's sensibility. However, the movie couldn't even be called a film if anyone else other than Ben Kingsley was cast as the main character.",1191196800,,873,4.49685534591195
2919168,1,B000UAE7KO,"I wrote a review of this film for this space when YOU KILL ME was first released.  I gave one star for Ben Kingsley's performance and one star for the reverence shown to AA's twelve-step program.  But I raised questions about the overall content of the film and the development of the female lead character.

Soon after my submission of this critique, the listing was removed from Amazon.  A day later, it reappeared but my comments had vanished.  I submitted a new version of the earlier opinions, somewhat toned down, and rated the movie one star (removing one star because the film's marketers had removed the previous comments).

Within hours, the site disappeared again.  It now resurfaces, again without my submission.  Subtract one more star, for dishonest marketing.  (Except Amazon requires at least one star, in order to post comments.)

Kingsley does indeed do a good job, in a role that looks to have been desgned for the present-aged Robert DeNiro.  Kingsley does it better.  And the rest of the cast does well, despite the cloudiness of te script.

But repeatedly this is a one joke ""comedy.""  Kingsley's character intimidates and kills people for a living, and seeks to heal his alcoholism so he can intimidate and kill again with his former efficiency.  The joke is undercut, however, by a universal acceptance of this questionable profession.

We see the protagonist ""meet cute"" with a public official before he intimidates the victim into reversing a decision against unsafe housing; the goon's client turns out to be sneering and condescending against his hit man, but gets away with his crime.

We see the protagonist confess to his AA group that he kills people for a living, and no one registers more than a momentary unease.

We see loutish Irish drunks (all Irish in this movie are loutish and/or drunks) at a wake, where the deceased widow (of a certain age) causes a car crash when she grabs Kingsley's crotch and then accuses her victim of sexual molestation.  The screenwriter's point is made that going off the wagon can lead one to wake up in a gutter after a shameful interlude.  But, that accomplished, the incident is utterly forgotten.  There are no consequences to the protagonist's job or within the legal system.

What legal system?  This film never depicts one.

The love interest is a woman half Kingsley's age whose job on paper is pointless (selling ""air"" on television) and never pursued as a viable plot point to explain this character.  In the great tradition of movies about alcoholic matings, this couple's main attraction for each other apparently is that they a both terribly lonely and damaged.  Great resource for comedy there, yes?  The arc for the heroine is that she eventually accepts her lover's anomie by becoming his killer accomplice.  The family that slays together....  Makes one feel all warm in side, kinda like Capra.

Years ago I was surprised when my ""adult ed."" students objected to our unit on Hitchcock's best films.  They said they disliked the director manipulating them to endorse and identify with values they found troubling and distasteful.  YOU KILL ME is certainly not in the same league as a Hitchcoc movie, but its promotion of disquieting amorality as a source of humor clues me in to what my former students meant.",1191110400,10,3294,4.889891696750903
2919169,3,B000UAE7KO,"Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have had success with such collaborations as 'The Chronicles of Narnia' and 'The Life and Death of Peter Sellers', proving their skills, and yet in this strange amalgam of serious versus romantic versus dark comedy they have created a series of vignettes loosely tied together and named it YOU KILL ME.  The film as directed by John Dahl (aided by a superb cluster of fine actors) almost works despite itself, but in the end the audience is left wondering just what the purpose of the fragmented nature of the story was!

The story begins in Buffalo, NY where the Irish gang is coercing the Chinese gang to join forces against the rapidly diminishing Polish gang. The head man for the Polish is Roman Krzeminski (Philip Baker Hall) aided by Stef Czyprynski (Marcus Thomas) both of whom rely on their hit man Frank Falenczyk (Ben Kingsley) - an aging alcoholic who lately has had too many missed or messy deaths because of his constant state of inebriation. Roman feels the pinch as Irish gang leader Edward O'Leary (Dennis Farina) escapes being snuffed by Frank, and Frank is sent to San Francisco to dry out and shape up.  In San Francisco, Frank is monitored by Dave (Bill Pullman) who finds Frank a job in a funeral home making up corpses and forces Frank into AA meetings. Gradually Frank gets sober, only to meet a woman Laurel (Ta Leoni) who is also a bit beaten by her own demons.  They form a fragile and odd relationship, each for some reason feeling the need to mutually open up - a new experience for both. Frank's AA sponsor Tom (Luke Wilson) adds to the growing away from alcohol process and also aids Frank in his attraction to Laurel. Lapses into booze occur and Frank finally feels he is a failure and returns to Buffalo to resume his 'work', but to his surprise, the changes that occurred in San Francisco follow him - in a good way.

Even with the Cuisinart-blended fragments of a story, the cast is so strong that the film works.  Kingsley is convincing, Leoni is superb, and the rest of the ensemble rises to the occasion with the little screen time they are given.  And while the movie feels like a spoof on AA meetings and a spoof on organized crime and on funeral parlor secrets, in the end it seems like a fairly solid love story - albeit a weird one.  YOU KILL ME is an acquired taste.  Grady Harp, September 07",1190505600,,2383,4.562060889929742
2919170,3,B000UAE7KO,"Just watched this, and despite its various charms, have to say I was a little disappointed, mainly because this is a very solid script that wasn't done justice.

Kingsley isn't quite believeable as a hit man, either. What is it with Hollywood trying to tell us again and again that assassins can be just nice, normal guys who happen to kill people? I don't buy it. Ben just seems nice and confused, but never really conveys the ruthlessness a true killer needs. Gandhi as assassin could have been so much funnier.(An aside: they do a great job concealing Kingsley's height; only once or twice do we realize that he is a foot shorter than every other actor.)

It's meant to be a comedy, ok, but it's also trying to be serious. It misses somewhat on both counts. The Sopranos does a much better job on all fronts.

There are some great lines, but the whole film feels a little off-kilter. This could have been hilarious, but my gut says that the director Dahl just couldn't inspire these actors enough to create that magic glow that makes great movies great. The often very funny script just kind of falls out of these characters' mouths at times. The words want more passion, but get pretty lifeless, laconic delivery at many points.

Wilson is decent, as is Leoni, and Farina reprises his Snatch role to some degree; he's a prperly nasty, smug gangster, and the scene with him and Philip Baker Hall going toe to toe has some of the snarl real gangsters display. But then Hall is back to unbelievable in other scenes (not his best performance, by a mile), because neither Farina nor the director is pushing him, I guess.

All in all, this could've been really great. Instead it's just pleasant. With a good script and fine actors, the blame must lie at the director's feet.
Nice SF location shots, though.

I'd watch the first four Sopranos seasons before I'd see this, if you haven't. And after that, any one of many much better gangster flicks.

You Kill Me didn't slay me; not a waste of time, but not really worth seeking out.",1190419200,,2029,4.573002754820936
2919171,5,B000UAE7KO,"This is a lovely contained and lean story about a vodka drinking hitter who is forced into therapy by his mob boss. It is infused with dry humor and light dark (grey) humor, and a parade of entertaining characters played by actors and actresses that are right on their game. Not to mention a plot with a bit of everything without being unrealistic, gratuitous, or worn and tired. I personally enjoyed it a lot and will be getting it the tuesday it comes out, because this is Ben Kingsley at his finest since Sexy Beast, and shows a less psychotic psychotic. Top marks for originality. I recommend it for anyone who is fascinated with organized crime or hitmen, enjoy vivid characters and subtle humor, or if you are bored and looking for a quick rewarding adventure.",1190246400,,766,4.639705882352941
2919172,5,B000UAE7KO,"Tea Leoni and Ben Kingsly are the perfect complement to each other in this brutally honest spoof of AA.  Having been to a few meetings myself, I can speak from experience that the 12 step program can be cut to one easy step -- shut-up and quit, snivelers!  Ben is completely believable as a contract killer too drunk to pull the trigger.  And Tea shines as her normal, very funny and smart self.  Luke Wilson wanders around aimlessly like he was added at the last minute for a name credit.  What a relief to watch a movie that doesn't start slow and end with a disappointment.  These two trade barbs with the precision of Irish Clog Dancers.  Not only will you find yourself laughing out loud, you will also find yourself shedding a tear of happiness toward the end.  If you don't find this flick LOL funny then you should trade in your blue jeans for and white collar and sulk into a seminary until you find your sense of humor.

2919173,4,B000UAE7KO,"""You Kill Me"" is a great ""little"" movie about a Polish hit-man from a snow plowing family in Buffalo, NY. Played by Ben Kingsley, the title character is a drunk that has to go to rehab or be kicked out of the family. (most likely,killed). He moves to San Fran and joins AA. Gets a job at a funeral home and meets the girl of his dreams. If you like quirky independent films that are more story than showy, this movie is for you. Great performance by Luke Wilson as well. Much funnier than the title suggests, and one to savor with the rest of your collection.",1189900800,43,559,4.233644859813084
2919174,3,B000UAE7KO,"There is no movie starring Ben Kingsley that is not worth watching. `You Kill Me' is the story of Frank (Kingsley), a Polish hit man in Buffalo, New York, whose drinking is interfering with his job. When he botches the important job of killing an Irish rival mob leader (played by Dennis Farina), Frank's family, Polish mobsters who are being squeezed out of the snowplowing racket,give him an ultimatum: Get sober or get out.

Frank is sent inexplicably to San Fransisco, to dry out and get back on track. While there, he joins Alcoholics Anonymous, works as a mortician's assistant, befriends a tollbooth worker (played by Luke Wilson), and falls in love with a woman (Tea Leoni) so used to dating men who eventually tell her that they are gay and leave her, that she is willing to put up with anything to make it work with Frank.

Frank yearns for sobriety so he can become the hit man he once was, before beer and vodka made him sloppy. He keeps meticulous records of the people he has wronged, not by killing them, but by killing them incorrectly. To make amends, he mails the victim's families' anonymous gift cards of apology. As Leoni puts it "" So, getting stabbed in the eye [instead of the throat] gets your family fifty dollars off their next purchase of electronics?"" And Frank nods. ""It's a start.""

`You Kill Me' is a dark romantic comedy with some terrific off-beat characters, including a real estate salesman played by Bill Pullman who gets Frank an apartment in San Francisco, and a jar of cashew butter as a welcoming gift. ""Why not just use peanuts?' Frank asks. Which is exactly what a Buffalonian would ask.

`You Kill Me', directed by John Dahl seems conceptualized around the question: ""What could happen if a hit man joined AA?' While it works mostly because of Kingsley's performance, writer David Chase of `The Sopranos' has already asked and answered this question. What followed was a long line of awful movies including`Analyze This', which even Robert DiNiro couldn't save. But how many completely original ideas actually exist?

Because I live in Buffalo I was preoccupied with the authenticity of `You Kill Me'. The best jab at the Queen City is the first time Frank Speaks at an AA meeting. ""Hello, I'm Frank and I'm an alcoholic. It took me a long time to realize this because I am from Buffalo.""
`You Kill Me' was not filmed in Buffalo except for some stock footage. It was filmed in Manitoba. But the interior sets were believable, as Frank lives in a big, old, `Buffalo' house, with a gas stove, and tile and wood kitchen, and thee-diamond front door leading to a concrete stoop with black iron railings. Frank does a great trick with a bottle of vodka to keep him motivated to shovel (I am definitely going to try it in a few months-maybe weeks). Frank wakes up to an announcement on his retro radio of an upcoming event at the Polish Civic Center. This would be even better if Buffalo had a Polish Civic Center. And Dennis Farina makes a whispered reference to the powerful labor unions at Bethlehem Steel. But the movie takes place in present time.

Frank tells a very original and thoughtful anecdote of Buffalo history, about the assassination of President McKinley. But if Dahl wanted to keep up us completely swept up in the image of Buffalo as a Polish-centric, snowplow-warring, beer-drinking, racially divided city, that made Frank what he is, he should have known that, sober or drunk, Frank would never roll a gutter ball at a bowling alley in San Francisco.",1189900800,7,3508,4.7052117263843645

2919202,5,B000UAE7KO,"I've spent nearly 40 years in the film business, and feel humbly capable of writing a review discussing the cinematography, the use of color, light and shadow. I could talk about the story line, which is basically the ""old boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy..."" well, why spoil it?

I could also talk about the very clever conundrum posed in the story... one in which the on screen characters and the audience both are conflicted by the fact that there can only be two outcomes... both bad, yet... again, I'm not going to spoil it. Instead I'm going to tell you something far more important about this film.

I am a recovering alcoholic. I've been fighting this disease for the last ten years when I finally admitted I was powerless over alcohol. Not long ago, I finally made a breakthrough, or rather, my ""Higher Power"" did. I am happily and joyously thankful for my new-found sobriety every day, and this movie captures that magical feeling in this cross between a chick flick and a really good gangster movie.

Normally, I only watch movies online that are already free with my subscriptions, but I paid extra for this, and it turned out to be both a reward for and a reinforcement of my new-found sobriety. The actors are excellent and very well cast. You'll recognize gangsters from such terrific films as ""Goodfellas"" and the like. Tea Leone has just the right balance of feminine charm, irreverent intelligence and strength to balance Ben Kingsley's persona onscreen. Even the AA meeting scenes are pretty well represented, especially for a movie.

But where ""You Kill Me"" really hits home is the feeling of relief and even joy as the story unfolds. It just feels authentic. You see, most people like me just couldn't imagine a life without drinking. I couldn't. I'd have rather died... and I almost did. Now that I'm sober, every day expresses itself with the same growing feeling of confidence and self-respect this movie shows so well. And isn't that what a movie is supposed to do? Suspend all disbelief and transport you into the story so you feel it is happening to you? As a raging alcoholic - and I will be one for the rest of my life - this movie made me feel good, and it gives me hope.

If you or someone you know is an alcoholic, I urge you to watch this film. If you're in the program, tell your sponsor it qualifies as one meeting... and if you think you MAY be an alcoholic, you probably are. You've seen the tests in magazines... you know, answer a few questions the wrong way and bang... the ugly results are right in front of you. Personally, I think the test should start with one question, ""Are you taking this test because you think you may have a drinking problem?"" If you say yes, you don't need to finish the test. Get into a program. Stick with it and you will find your life more satisfying than all the yoga, money and single malt could buy

I love movies that portray some reality is a way that is engaging and authentic. ""You Kill Me"" does that. If you have no problem with alcohol, I'm glad for you. You should watch this movie for it's subtle and seductive humor, as well as it's superb performances. If you are an alcoholic, I think you'll enjoy this onscreen look at the fellowship with an understanding and smiles that those without our disease just don't understand. Either way I think you'll enjoy this romantic tale. I highly recommend it . Don C., Living One Day At A Time in South Carolina",1473724800,2,3436,4.533870967741936

This is perfect for a movie to mix up comedy, drama, some action and some romance if it's done well.  It's done well.  The comedy here is done with a deft touch mostly with facial expressions.  It's not often I see Kingsley in a comedic or even part-comedic role while Owen and Farina, both of whom can be great comedians, have relatively straight roles here.

2919289,4,B000UAE7KO,"Professional reviewers must love such films, because they can concentrate on their comments while dashing off a simple plot summary like this:

After snoozing through a critical assignment in an alcoholic haze, Buffalo hit man Frank Falenczyk/Ben  Kingsley is finally forced into the AA program in remote San Francisco by his Polish crime family. Cue the complications, with a quirky west coast love interest in Laurel/Tea Leoni and gathering trouble back home.

It probably would never happen, but it COULD have. And one of the real beauties of this movie is, everything has that sort of delicate balance. Between the authentic and the fabricated. The black humor and the drama. The gays and the straights. The alcoholic and the sober. Denizens of blue collar, snowy Buffalo and more upscale, temperate San Francisco. And the rivalry between Frank's people and the rival Irish gang led by Ed O'Leary/Dennis Farina. Then too, the filmwork is terrific, particularly the outdoor shots in San Francisco and (apparently) Canadian Manitoba filling in for Buffalo. Think of what must have gone into visually composing those scenes! The script dialogue is solid as well, with probably a half dozen memorable exchanges. Here's one of my favorites:

San Fran new acquaintance: What business are you in?
Frank [entering evasive mode]: Personnel.
SFNA: Hiring?
Frank: More like firing.

All of that works well. But what really seals the deal is Frank/Kingsley. A lot of cooperative effort went into making him a cohesive character. From the opening snow shoveling scene in front of the house where he lives alone, he's seen to be ever observant and careful, economical in physical movement, no conversationalist because to get chatty with outsiders would be dangerous. All of which rings true for a professional killer. He's never depicted as a drunken buffoon, just a guy with a serious problem he gradually admits and resolves to beat. Laurel is willing to gamble on him because straight guys are tougher to find in her home town than Buffalo. Again, nearly plausible, largely because Kingsley sells the packaged character. And the film.

To me and a majority of viewers, anyway.",1421539200,,2170,5.1331444759206795

Frank is an alcoholic. He screws up royally when he falls asleep while waiting for his target to arrive.

2919337,4,B000UAE7KO,"So many mixed genre films are like a meal with multiple entrees, served by a hyperactive waiter. Every time you start to get a taste for one of the dishes, the waiter yanks the plate away, replacing it with another flavor, over & over, until, by the time you get to the end of the meal, you're not sure what the chef was trying to achieve.

To continue the metaphor, You Kill Me is a delicious black comedy that subtly blends a romance crime family saga, & redemption tale. Every scene contains at least a taste of each, all held together with a continuity of style & tone that most mixed genre films fail to achieve.

Ben Kingsley & Ta Leoni are perfectly cast as Frank, an alcoholic hit man whose boss has shipped off to San Francisco to sober up, and Laurel, a woman whose between bad relationships. In Frank, she discovers a good man, worthy of love & trust, even though his wicked knife & gun skills are a bit troubling.

The supporting cast is strong, especially Luke Wilson as Frankss AA sponsor and Philip Baker Hall as the head of Franks beleaguered crime family.

2919414,5,B000UAE7KO,"John Dahl's directing career started with Kill Me Again, a compact little film noir thriller about stolen money, double crosses, and people not worried about ""traditional"" morality or the ethical considerations in killing people.  In You Kill Me, Dahl takes these same ideas and archetypes and moves them into the realm of comedy.  Or rather, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely do - they wrote the screenplay as a spec, long before Dahl was ever involved.  But it SEEMS like a Dahl story, and his direction of it is pitch-perfect.  Sir Ben Kingsley plays a Polish hit man from Buffalo, with a drinking problem so severe that - after he's missed one too many jobs - his family sends him to San Francisco to dry out.  He reluctantly joins AA, finds a sponsor (Luke Wilson), gets a family-sponsored day job in a funeral home, and meets one more in a long line of essentially sociopathic Dahl heroines (Tea' Leone).  Tea' doesn't kill or rob, but she's okay with the fact that Kingsley's Frank is a professional killer - just so long as he doesn't decide to turn gay on her (apparently a problem she'd had once before, in her hometown of San Francisco).  The story follows Frank's progress to a Good Sobriety, with the usual trials and slip-ups along the way, as he struggles to find himself.  Not so he can reform his life of crime, but so that he can get back to killing people full-time, and do a better job of it.  The film is brilliantly funny, with sharp and witty dialogue throughout, and the performances are spot-on.  Others have noted that while Dennis Farina's mob boss is well-portrayed, the fact that he's supposed to be an IRISH mob boss is patently silly; he's about as Irish as pasta fazool.  But that's a quibble; this is a delightful film in the 'funny hitman' sub-genre, right along side Grosse Pointe Blank and In Bruges - which is where the DVD sits, on the shelf in my book case.  Lots of great extras on the disc, including a director's commentary track that includes the screenwriters (it's ABOUT TIME!) and some great behind-the-scenes material.  If you like Dahl's other films, or you like funny hitman movies, this is a must-see.",1339632000,,2156,4.671957671957672
2919435,4,B000UAE7KO,"Is San Francisco the place where an alcoholic assassin from Buffalo might find sobriety? Apparently that's the prescription for Frank Falenczyk (Ben Kingsley), at least according to his uncle Roman, head of a Buffalo crime family that values Frank's skills but can no longer rely on him to get the job done when it needs to get done. (He's supposed to have killed Dennis Farina, which is always a good idea in movies like this, but fails due to being smashed out of his gourd while on the job.) Frank, it has to be said, is a murdering scumbag who's circling the drain in Buffalo and doesn't really give a damn. Redemption? Self-awareness? He had no use for them. He's fine with who he is and what he does, and only gradually comes consider the possibility that maybe he doesn't want to go down the drain after all. Armed with Ben Kingsley's charisma and a blunt honesty, Frank makes friends in Frisco and manages fitful progress in getting on top of the booze, only to have his old life in Buffalo call on him to be the coldly efficient killer he once was. Can Frank, who once relied on Roman to tell him where to aim, step up sober in the crunch and call the shots?

Frank is in that brotherhood of cinematic villains who are far more dangerous to other villains than to decent citizens, and Ben Kingsley is quite convincing and fun in this turn. Even more fun is Bill Pullman as Frank's slimeball minder in San Francisco; the economy with which he establishes a basis on which the two men may thoroughly dislike each other is impressive. T&eacute;a Leoni also acquits herself well as a not particularly bereft new widow with personality quirks that not only allow you to buy her attraction to Frank but also leave you wondering if she really ought to be allowed to run around loose. Luke Wilson has the least to contribute as a fellow alcoholic who puts himself forward to be Frank's sponsor--the two have some nice moments, but nothing the movie really requires. And while Frank's time in 'Frisco is diverting, it's the crime drama playing out in Frank's absence in Buffalo that really propels the narrative; Frank's failure is the pivot on which events turn, and it is these events that afford Frank a chance at a species of something that might matter to him after all: redemption.",1331510400,,2287,4.591687041564792

2919437,5,B000UAE7KO,"One of the most difficult things to impart to newly recovering alcoholics and addicts are the 12 Steps of AA. This is an entertaining movie that approaches the subject with skill and comedy. Even though the main character is a contract killer who has a drinking problem, the viewer can enjoy watching him work the Steps interspersed with comedic relief. Ben Kingsley plays the alcoholic hit man and with Tea Leoni learning about killing people and the 12 Steps, they make a delightful pair. Throw in Luke Wilson, who plays Kingsley's sponsor and you have a killer (pun intended) comedy with a great message. In life, we all take two steps forward and, sometimes, take one step back; the whole idea is to keep going.",1322438400,,715,4.728
2919438,3,B000UAE7KO,"A drunken Polish hit man from Buffalo exiled to San Francisco finds love working as a mortician's assistance and going to AA meetings. Sound quirky? It is. This satirical look at AA and contemporary relationships features great acting from Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni and good pacing from director John Dahl. Unfortunately the plot is a little thin and some of the supporting characters (Dennis Farina, Philip Baker Hall) are a little too over-the-top while others are a little too under the top (Luke Wilson), so the bulk of the film falls to the two stars, who individually are excellent, but who have no chemistry at all. Absent chemistry, their ""romance"" seems contrived, and I think the most they manage to conjure up is a kiss on the forehead.

This film does have its moments, especially during the AA meetings.",1310256000,,817,4.835714285714285
2919439,5,B000UAE7KO,"Loved every minute of this movie. Loved it! And to be honest, I'm relieved. I've been a fan of Ben Kingsley for so long that it broke my spirit that he struck out with so many at-bats. I hoped for a hit, any kind of hit. Wasn't looking for a home run, just making solid contact.

This is without a doubt, in my opinion, one of the best roles Kingsley has had in years. Thoroughly enjoyed him as Frank Falenczyk, the burnt-out alcoholic mob hitman. Seen too much, done too much, everything too much except the one thing all people really need: Love. After screwing up a big contract, he's ordered to San Francisco to dry out and take on a ""normal"" job. And should he fail doing either - he'll be his own next customer.

Frank's struggle with alcohol, while not entirely the focus of this dark comedy, is accurately portrayed given the scope of the role. He's a distracted unbeliever in the process, literally forced to go to the meetings. And he's told straight off by his sponsor, played by Luke Wilson, that temptation and failure is common during that first year; until he freely chooses the path, he'll never find true sobriety. Frank dismisses him as a proselytizer and buffoon. But during another alcoholic binge, he finally 'hits bottom', by nearly killing the woman he loves. And in a short powerful scene - the pain and regret he emotes is very real, very tangible. You see the actor that won the Academy Award right then and there.

Admittedly, I've had a serious thing for Ta Leone since she first appeared on the small screen; I never tire of her performances. Unfortunately her amazing presence is invariably lost to many forgettable vehicles. Thankfully, this production captured her natural beauty and brilliantly sharp wit as Laurel Pearson, an acerbic advertising executive who lets down her protective wall for the one guy who isn't fronting a slick polished pretense in order to separate her from her panties.

And Bill Pullman has never been better. He is just bleeping fantastic in his role as west coast facilitator to an east coast mob family. Wonderfully cold, threatening and morally corrupt with just the right touch of casual viciousness. This would be a difficult role for many actors who have taken on this kind of performance, but more so for an actor better known for comedies. Jeff Daniels in the powerhouse film '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Traitor/dp/B0000ACOXL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Traitor</a>' comes to mind; incapable of shedding his goofy skin to ever be believed as a hardened secret agent. But Pullman is subtly savage as the opportunistic real estate agent and general fixer. Just wonderful.

Clearly, this project is in David Mamet-mode. And while no writer admits to it - so many try. Call it 'inspired by' or 'homage', but so many filmmakers attempt it and miserably miss the mark, often because they're trying too hard to mimic the man's work. This isn't the case for Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely; the writing duo does a pretty decent cutting-edged Mamet while still maintaining their own identity, and for that I'm grateful. When my cultural touchstone passes, I know there will be someone who can pick-up the torch without fear of being labeled a cheapened knockoff.

If you enjoy sharp dialogue from characters living outside of the mainstream, and the absurd hilarity found in the darkened corners of life, then 'You Kill Me' is a must watch.",1307664000,,3448,4.9567474048442905

2919443,1,B000UAE7KO,"I bought this film three hours ago in a mall.  It wasn't as though I had been seeking it out.  I was simply browsing when the DVD cover for Sexy Beast caught my eye.  I saw that it had Ben Kingsley in it.  Suddenly, I began to remember that three years ago I had seen a TV spot for a film in which Ben Kingsley plays a hitman.  I also remembered that it had Tea Leoni and that it had seemed darkly comedic.  I remembered that it had seemed to appeal to me.  But I couldn't remember the title.  I spent 15 minutes trying to remember, and 15 minutes plugging Tea Leoni and Ben Kingsley into the store computer's search engine.  Finally, the film was revealed to be You Kill Me; and it was apparently in stock.  What joy was mine....

But then I saw the DVD cover.  It sported three excerpts from apparently longer reviews lauding the film.  For instance:  ""You'll DIE laughing!"" ""A KILLER COMEDY!"" and ""TWO THUMBS UP! It's just a lot of fun!""  Terribly off-putting as the obvious insecurity of this self-advertising was, I had watched many movies on the IFC Film channel and been very pleased, saw that this was an IFC release, and chose to put the reviews out of my mind and buy the film.  That was three hours ago.

Once the menu for the DVD loaded, I went straight to the special features to watch the theatrical trailer in order to obliterate any doubt that I had actually liked that TV spot I had seen only three years ago.  The same fondness I had seemed to feel for the TV spot was not reawakened by the theatrical trailer.  So I watched the film.  That was an hour and a half ago.

What can I write but that the seeming fondness I had exhibited for the TV spot of long ago is now utterly incomprehensible to me.  The premise for the film--that a hitman from New York whose killing suffers from his alcoholism is sent to an AA group in San Francisco to recover--is decidedly absurd, and absurdity lends itself very well to camp.  The filmmakers, however, did not take this route: the script lacks any stylization and every actor brings an unwavering gravitas to his or her role.  Because of this, the film feels greatly unbalanced.  As previously stated, the concept for the film is unambiguously light but its trivial potential is ruined by a lack of ambivalence in the earnestnesss of its execution.  And it's due to this, I think, that one reviewer (quite rightly) found the seeming endorsement of mob killings disturbing in a film that is rather ostentatiously and unequivocally advertised as a comedy.  Death, whether by murder or misadventure, has been played to rather ingenious effect in films such as Beetlejuice, Heathers, and Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, precisely because the tone of those films, whether altogether absurd or satirical, was even throughout.",1276646400,,2781,4.554435483870968

2919459,2,B000UAE7KO,"This DVD was a waste of plastic and Luke Wilson.

The big problem is the script. In fact, I have trouble understanding how this movie even got made unless the actors all agreed to do it on a dare at some LA pool party where they were all equally sloshed. The characters are flimsy and quirky to the point of insanity, with no explanations offered. If the plot isn't 100% predictable, that's only because you'll be too shocked while it rapes your prefrontal cortex to think ahead.

And what's wrong with Ben Kingsley? For some reason he plays a socially challenged gas attendant instead of a contract killer. His performance reminded me of an amalgamation of the certain type of quiet sociopath I meet at DMVs and bus stops, and Kingsley's portrayal is as fun to watch as it is to get a license renewal out of his real life counterpart. The difference with You Kill Me is you are stuck with him for an hour and a half.

In summation: the absurdist twists are neither interesting nor ridiculous enough to be funny, and since the plot has no redeeming value in and of itself, this makes for a movie as entertaining* as watching Ben Kingsley work through a bout of troubling constipation.

I give this movie two stars because the cinematography is absolutely brilliant. Whoever worked the exposure levels on those cameras deserves an award, especially since they were subject to untold takes of Kingsley's Simple Jack (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tropic-Thunder/dp/B001H5X7I4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tropic Thunder</a>&nbsp;reference; you're probably better off seeing that).

2919460,3,B000UAE7KO,"This was an interesting film, start-to-finish, with a little action, romance, humor, melodrama, suspense....a good combination of a lot of things. The acting is good, led by the always-fascinating Ben Kingsley who plays the lead role.

There was a good contrast in the areas: the snowy cold of winter in Buffalo and the dry and brighter look of San Francisco. I like the supporting actors in here, beginning with Dennis Farina as ""O'Leary."" He's another actor that always gets your attention. The movie also gives a nice plug for Alcoholics Anonymous. I kept waiting the smart remarks about it, but they surprised me on that one. Respect was given for the no-nonsense approach given by that famous organization which has helped a lot of people.

Even though it's ""dark humor,"" the message said in here that being an alcoholic is a more serious problem than being a hit-man is a little far out. Tea Leoni's character was stupid and too profane.  Also, being from the Buffalo area, I didn't care for the cheap shots on the city, either. People here are tired of that.

Overall, this is a strange film,and not surprising it wasn't a hit with the public. But, if you like something different, something a little ""dark"" yet romantic, you'd probably like this film. It's quirky, which seems to be the kinds of films Kingsley has been doing the past decade (""Sexy Beast,"" ""House Of Sand And Fog,"" etc.)",1246406400,,1395,4.775933609958506

Tea Leoni is refreshing, and obviously needs to work more.  She is well-cast as the somewhat flawed, understanding companion to Frank, and also brings the perfect mordant comic touch.

The rest of the cast is filled out with veteran character actors such as Philip Baker Hall and Dennis Farina, as well as understated, equally winning performances by Bill Pullman and Luke Wilson.

I loved the offbeat story of redemption, regret, and self-discovery, set amid smart, lovingly-filmed scenes of San Francisco and, later, Buffalo.  Hilarious set pieces at the funeral home and at various AA meetings bring real life and dimension to Frank's dogged efforts at self-improvement.

2919463,4,B000UAE7KO,"You Kill Me is one of the movies that's entertaining on so many levels. Openly, unabashedly silly, this is a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but is clever enough to engage the viewer.

Sir Ben Kingsley plays Frank Falencyk, a hitman who works for a Polish crime family in Buffalo. He's hits the skids in a big way by becoming an alcoholic. His work becomes so affected by his problem that he misses making a big hit on the Irish rival of his family. As a result, he's sent to San Francisco to dry out. He ends up working in a funeral home, and meets a young woman, played by Tea Leoni, while working on one of her relatives.

Falencyk bounces back and forth between sobriety and inebriation, trying to make sense of his growing infatuation with Leoni, and getting advice from his AA sponsor, a gay Golden Gate Bridge tollbooth worker played by Luke Wilson. Meanwhile, the results of Falencyk's missed hit are devastating to the Polish crime family. The Irish gang, led by Dennis Farina, is taking over all of the other gang's turf, setting the stage for a dangerous homecoming for Frank.

The writing in You Kill Me is sharp and clever. It makes the movie enjoyable because while some scenes are goofy and ridiculous, the script prevents the movie from being a straight-up satire. Instead, the movie comes off like a odd slice-of-life populated by odd people with odd perspectives on life. The acting is solid and goes with the flow of the script.

Frank Falenczyk is the primo hit man for the Polish mafia in Buffalo, an organization that has come under increasing attack from Greek and Chinese gangs trying to muscle their way into the area.  Frank also happens to be a raging alcoholic, a condition that has been adversely affecting his job performance of late (he`s either messing up his killings or missing his targets altogether).  To rectify the problem, his bosses send him off to San Francisco, where he is immediately enrolled in an AA program, the plan being that when he has finally sobered up, he'll be able to return home and resume his life as a paid assassin.

Part crime drama and part May-December romance, ""You Kill Me"" is a wry dark comedy that features, amidst its various other virtues, a ""killer"" performance by Ben Kingsley.  Frank is a man who means no ill-will towards anyone, even the people who fall victim to his occupation.  Killing-for-hire is just a job like any other to Frank, and he really only feels guilty when he gets sloppy in his work (usually the result of the alcoholism), resulting in unnecessary suffering for his target.  Otherwise, he strives to be a professional in his job and takes great pride in his work - or at least he would if he could ever get this monkey off his back.  Even his new girlfriend in San Francisco - after some initial hesitation over the whole I`m-dating-a-hit-man thing - comes to see the soundness of his way of thinking.  Still, there's nothing like the love of a good, nonjudgmental woman to inspire a man to engage in some serious introspective soul-searching and to provide him with a whole new outlook on life.

Filled with offbeat characters and witty one-liners, the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely has a sly way of insinuating itself into our affections despite the potential distastefulness lurking in the premise.  Still, the ""lovable killer"" has long been an accepted staple of movie comedy (the little old ladies in ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" Dennis Price in ""Kind Hearts and Coronets,"" Charlie Chaplin in ""Monsieur Verdoux,"" just to name a few) and Kingsley's marvelously understated and self-effacing performance makes Frank fit to stand alongside such distinguished company.  For added interest, this performance is almost a flipside antidote to the one he gave in ""Sexy Beast,"" wherein he turned a cold-blooded killer into a cringe-inducing monster.

As Laurel, the pragmatic woman who falls for this decidedly unorthodox older man, Tea Leoni brings a great deal of believability and charm to their relationship. And although Luke Wilson is pretty much wasted in the underdeveloped part of  Frank's AA sponsor, Dennis Farina and Phillip Baker Hall flesh out their small but effective roles as two warring mob bosses.",1219363200,,2781,4.9655172413793105

2919481,4,B000UAE7KO,"You might think that a movie about an alcoholic hit man finding love in San Francisco would be more than a ridiculous, but Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni find a way to inject just enough believability into an unbelievable premise to make You Kill Me an excellent black comedy.

Kingsley's Frank (the go to hit man for a Polish crime family in Buffalo) is every bit as menacing as the thug he played in Sexy Beast.  But Frank is more human, way, way more human!  From the opening scene where he uses his love of alcohol as a form of inducement to shovel snow from his front door and sidewalk, and on to his forced relocation (due to a botched hit) and attempts at sobriety, Kingsley makes for the most interesting murderer since John Cusack in Grosse Point Blank.

Fed up by the affect that alcohol has had on his performance, Frank's family sends him cross country to get into a 12 step program.  There he gets a job in a funeral parlor (yep), joins AA and acquires a sponsor (Luke Wilson, in a calm and subtle performance).  He also meets a woman played by Tea Leoni, and begins a relationship.  Like any essentially non-voluntary inductee into sobriety, Frank's efforts at drying out meet with a few fits and starts.

It takes Frank a while to realize that he does have a problem, but once he comes to grip with the fact that booze has made him a less efficient killer, he does begin to apply himself.

Leoni is marvelous as the lonely recipient of Frank's affections.  Her wordless reactions to his confessions in front of his AA group are priceless!  Tea makes the whole ""falling in love with a callous killer"" thing understandable.

2919484,5,B000UAE7KO,"Superbly executed in every aspect, John Dahl's ""You Kill Me"" is one of those rare black comedies that snaps and crackles with wit and verve without the slightest trace of self-consciousness. From budding screenwriting talents Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the morbid little tale is thoroughly engrossing and completely original.

Frank, portrayed by Sir Ben Kingsley, is a hit man for a sect of Poles who fight to maintain their culture and identity in Buffalo, New York against an onslaught of righteous Irish thugs who have muscled in on nearly all they have. Unfortunately, Frank is also a shameless drunk, and when it comes time for him to assassinate the clan's central figurehead Edward O'Leary, played by the always reliable Dennis Farina, he falls into a drunken stupor and misses the assignment.

At this point Frank's Uncle Roman, played by Philip Baker Hall, well known for his role as an overzealous library cop on a memorable ""Seinfeld"" episode, has had enough, even though Frank is family.

""Every time we send you out, I have to make a call to find out if they're dead!"" he yells at his nephew. ""I can't trust you anymore Frank!""

Roman, with help from his son Stef, played by Marcus Thomas, forces Frank to relocate to San Francisco to dry out, attend AA meetings and report to Dave, played with fervent zest by Bull Pullman, who phones back to Buffalo to report his progress.

The living embodiment of stoicism, Frank resists the move, the meetings and his forced job as a mortician's assistant, but he knows when he's licked and acquiesces. Along the way he befriends another alcoholic named Tom, played by Luke Wilson, and begins an unexpected relationship with Laurel, played to caustic perfection by Tea Leoni, who serves as one of the film's executive producers.

One of the best scenes involves Frank exploiting the `Anonymous' in Alcoholic's Anonymous when he makes a speech before the group.

""I don't know the exact definition of the word `alcoholic,' but from what I'm hearing here, it sounds like I'm a pretty good one,"" he says. ""I'm an even better killer. I want to do it again. I will do it again. But I know now, the only way I'm ever gonna get to do it again is if I stop drinking.""

She may be worldly-wise and rough around the edges, but Laurel is nevertheless uneasy about her new flame's lifestyle.

""Why should I bother?"" she asks.

""Because you don't want to be alone any more than I do,"" he replies.

""You know, it's sad,"" she says. ""But that's actually good enough for right now.""

However, trouble takes on a new meaning back home in Buffalo, and before he knows it Frank is on the first plane out of San Francisco to set things straight the only we he can.

There is no better actor alive today than Kingsley, and ""You Kill Me"" adds another chapter to his book of successes. Despite his sharp, distinctive features and piercing eyes he never fails to immerse himself in every character he plays, so much so that it is easy to wonder just who is playing the part.

Furthermore, Leoni fits her role like a glove, and the perfectly cast Hall strikes the perfect balance between sly humor and understated pathos. He does not merely act the part of Stef's father, he becomes his father - and the results are a marvel to watch. Also, with his small part Wilson is essentially along for the ride to add Frat Pack credibility, but he is always a welcome asset to any film he plays in.

With a quirky, intricate storyline and a broad appeal that can just as easily win over elitist arthouse audiences as it can those seeking more mainstream fare, ""You Kill Me"" is head and shoulders above the majority of this year's films, making it a puzzle that it did not gain a wide theatrical release last summer. Dahl's directorial work is masterful, and Markus and McFeely create a story that is equal parts comedy and crime-drama with no compromise necessary.

But when Frank heads out to do the job, he falls into a drunken stupor and misses his appointment.

Fed up with Frank's drinking problem, Roman sends him to San Francisco ""for a change of scenery"" and to attend AA meetings. Once in Frisco, he meets up with Roman's cross-country assistant, Dave (Bill Pullman), a bizarre real estate agent who gets Frank into a nice apartment, a job as a mortician's assistant, and into AA. Once at an AA meeting, Frank quickly leaves, feeling uncomfortable about revealing any of his weaknesses. But he meets up with Tom (Luke Wilson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Super-Ex-Girlfriend/dp/B000J4QW8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Super Ex-Girlfriend</a>) and the two form a tenuous friendship based on trust (Tom eventually becomes Frank's AA sponsor).

While at work in the funeral home, Frank meets Laurel (Teo Leoni), a strangely attractive woman with zero verbal filters. The two soon hone out a relationship built on brutal honesty and each other's desires to not be alone.

Once Frank starts drying up, word comes to him of a hit placed on his family back home, and he has to decide whether to return to Buffalo and killing, or to stay in San Francisco and create a new life for himself with Laurel. Strangely enough, both become an option by the 's end.

***END SPOILERS***

This is one of the quirkier films you'll ever see. Ben Kingsley's performance is outstanding as a confused and conflicted hitman who must decide what's worse: killing or alcoholism. But what seems worse to Frank (Kingsley's character) is killing poorly due to alcoholism (""I had to chase a guy fifteen blocks once in order to kill him. He knew why I was there. That's just wrong."") It's this intellectual yet disturbingly funny dialogue that fills the story and, trust me, it IS funny.

Most surprising is Bill Pullman's portrayal of Dave, the dorky real estate agent who believes himself to be some sort of ""boss"" within San Francisco. You're not sure how to take him throughout the entire length of the film. Is this guy for real? Pullman does a fantastic job keeping you guessing.

The only complaint would be the sexual attraction between someone of Kingsley's age and Leoni's. Obviously Kingsley is old enough to be Leoni's father. The chemistry seems a bit forced, but the dialogue often helps viewers forget this as it plunges ahead, making one laugh and giggle at the crazy things coming out of characters' mouths.",1195516800,2,3512,5.586466165413534
2919509,4,B000UAE7KO,"I hadn't heard about this movie before, but gave it a chance. I'm glad I did. It's a very good drama, with some funny moments. Ben Kingsley does a great job and his character is well developed. His character development, his relationship with Tea Leoni's character and his friendship with Luke Wilson's character are the best parts of the movie. The other subplots are less interesting and could have been given less time, but overall, it's a very good movie that I could watch again.",1194998400,,484,4.705882352941177
2919510,5,B000UAE7KO,"Director John Dahl did a wonderful job setting the tone of this film.  Great casting, great acting, interesting story, all done smoothly and understated.  Ben Kingsley and Ta Leoni are marvelous and create real chemistry on screen.  Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Philip Baker Hall and Bill Pullman all put in great performances.  This is a film I saw in the theater and immediately decided to purchase on DVD to own at home.  The extras make the disk (interviews,commentary) even more worth the purchase.",1194566400,,502,5.0
2919511,5,B000UAE7KO,I like this movie and its excellent cast. I first read some reviews before ordering and guess what? It's just as good if not better! The best compliment I can give this film is it's the type you'll want to watch again every so often to catch more of the dry (and dark) humor.,1194480000,,275,4.111111111111111
2919512,4,B000UAE7KO,"I'm surprised that this film attracted such venom from one reviewer on this site, since ""You Kill Me"" does for 12 step recovery what Al Franken did for the ACoA (Adult Children of Alcoholics) movement back in the early '90s with his dead on satire, ""Stuart Saves His Family.""  Of course, the notion that an AA ""home group"" would passively endorse a hit-man's amorality in the name of unconditional acceptance is absurd, but the medium is satire, which by definition involves exaggeration.  What makes that aspect of the story work so well is it's affectionate take on AA, while poking fun at some aspects of the group process.

It should never be lost that what AA, NA (Narcotics Anonymous), and other 12-step fellowships have and continue to accomplish is nothing short of miraculous, since addiction was considered untreatable until AA arrived on the scene in 1935.  And I would imagine that no one would find this film more hilarious than 12-steppers, who are hardly a grim lot.  At meetings, tears and courageous emotional sharing of experience, strength, and hope are well mixed with the frequent laughter of identification with the problem of addiction, as well as empathy for this hero's journey.

I loved this film.  The performances are low key and whacked (Tea Leoni has carved out a niche for such work.......see her in David O. Russell's ""Flirting with Disaster""), and Kingsley does a send-up on his ""Sexy Beast"" sociopath role that's reminiscent of Brando's ""Godfather"" parody in ""The Freshman.""

So rent or buy this film, and enjoy!",1192924800,7,1546,4.965116279069767
2919513,4,B000UAE7KO,"After John Dahl's last few films--Unforgettable, Rounders, and Joyride--I wasn't really expecting this to be as strong as his much earlier work--Red Rock West and The Last Seduction. But You Kill Me actually is a much better movie than the director's last three.

While it's still not as powerful as his two classics (Last Seduction and Red Rock West), it's a really good piece of work. The acting is very strong here. Ben Kingsley as the alcoholic hitman Frank belongs to a small Polish mob in Buffalo, New York, but can't control his urge to drink--so much so that he botches a hit on the Irish mob captain (Dennis Farina) who's muscling in on the Polish mob chief's (Philip Baker Hall) territory.

So the Polish chief sends Frank to San Francisco to sober up (this doesn't quite make sense, since there is certainly an AA chapter in Buffalo), and he gets a job as a funeral home makeup kinda guy, which is funny and stuff.

Now even though it kinda sounds like I'm making fun of the movie, the point is that it's fun to watch. The last three movies John Dahl made were just not that much fun to watch. The Last Seduction was fun to watch because Linda Fiorentino was SO good as a nasty b**ch of a femme fatale. And Red Rock West was fun to watch because Nicolas Cage was SO good as a guy caught in the noir world of desperation and corruption.

You Kill Me is fun to watch because the chemistry between Ben Kingsley's Frank and Tea Leoni's character (a woman he meets in San Francisco) is really odd, but strangely compelling and definitely ""gluey""--you can see them bonding with each other. So Dahl's two previous great movies were fun because they had characters who were either great at ""ungluing"" people from each other or were caught in the middle of people ungluing themselves from each other. Here, Kingsley and Leoni work well as a couple.

So yes, this is a really odd, quirky kind of love story in which, in fact, there IS murder and corruption, but also this wacky kind of sweetness--which is really, bottom line, the writers and the director kind of making fun of what love is all about and human behavior and the whole ball of wax.

But they have fun with it--and that's the whole point. So don't go to this film expecting to necessarily see a credible story. Would a woman as young as Tea Leoni's character REALISTICALLY fall in love with an oldster like Ben Kingsley? Well...maybe. I mean, it COULD happen.

Of course my teeth could all fall out of my mouth and turn into toy soldiers, too. Sure, that could happen. Uh huh. Yeah.

OK, maybe not. But the movie's still a lot of fun to watch. Hence the four stars.",1192406400,6,2630,4.48744769874477
2919514,4,B000UAE7KO,"This is one of the funniest films I have seen in years. While it is dark humor at its darkest, there is a moral here, which is when you let the people in your life down you pay for it as much as they do. It's the contrast between the content of the film, of the dysfunctional mob family and the underlying message of hope that makes this movie work. Of course, the perfectly deadpan and always on target performances of the two leads take what could have been a painfully bad film in lesser hands and elevate it to comic genius. Highly recommnded.",1192147200,2,547,4.269230769230769

8212687,5,B000UAE7KO,A great send up of mob  movies and 12 step programs.  I have been in AA for 31 years and have never seen such a funny movie about AA.  Kingsley and Bill Puhlman are fabulous.  I can't explain more to avoid spoiling the movie except to say that a 'mob' sends its chief enforcer to a new city to go to AA meetings and sober up.  If you love 12 step or hate 12 step you will love this movie.  True lovers of 'mob' movies may not care much for it except for Dennis Farina's role.,1499817600,,475,3.8958333333333335

8212689,5,B000UAE7KO,"One of the funniest movies of the 21st century. The movie is filled with hilarious lines and humor that is found in unusual places or circumstances.

Ben Kingsley is brilliant, Tea Leoni brings a presence not normally found in a female lead. That there is significant romance in a movie about an alcoholic hit-man who works in a mortuary is enough to give people a reason to buy this movie.

A laugh riot that also can be watched when celebrating love. One of the best movies made in the last 20 years.
