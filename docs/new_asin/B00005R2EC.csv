1654107,5,B00005R2EC,i love it. it made me thank about being careful when having sex because looke at what happin to her she got a baby and her ex-boyfriend said that they would grow up together and they all leaves some time and say that kod is not mine you sould think befor having sex and if you do use a condom,1141344000,2,292,3.8833333333333333
1654108,4,B00005R2EC,"I enjoyed this movie, I remember watching it on Lifetime when I was in high school and I was glad I could find it on DVD.",1121731200,10,121,3.6923076923076925
1654109,5,B00005R2EC,"I know its like an educational film to say no to sex for teenagers, but I really thought this movie was well done! Realistic and sad. Glad I watched it in health class. I didn't want to ever end up like Tina. She was just too young to go have a baby.",1074643200,8,250,3.826923076923077
1654110,1,B00005R2EC,"I saw this movie for Kirsten Dunst, and this is just for those who are big fans of hers because it is just plain awful. It is very low budget, the quality of filming is- let's just say there is no quality to the filming. The directing is poor, as is the acting- except from Kirsten of course. You may like to note that Julia Whelan who would go on to appear in ""Once And Again"" is here as Kirsten's kid sister and she manages to get to the pain of the character that she plays as always, but she just doesn't have much to work with. There is so much that could have been done with this film based on the concept, but those chances were wasted with this. Avoid!",1048809600,3,660,4.0458015267175576
1654111,1,B00005R2EC,"As the title above says, I saw this movie only for Kirsten Dunst. She brings a certain class to the ""After School Specialness"" of this movie. If you love Kirsten as much as me--you should get this movie, otherwise try somewhere else.",1046908800,,233,4.571428571428571
1654112,4,B00005R2EC,"Many girls around the country each year find themselves in these horrid positions. Kirsten Dunst did a superb job as Tina in this shockingly realistic film. I felt sorry for her as she had to put her young life on hold-- but then I didn't because she was like any fifteen-year-old girl: naive, vulnerable and harmfully impressionable. Any girl should watch this movie before giving herself away to any carnal, uncaring, hormonally imbalanced boy.",1007078400,2,446,5.04054054054054

1654176,4,B00005R2EC,"I remember watching this movie on lifetime movie network when I was in my teen years. I love this movie and when I got it, it was in great shape for a used dvd. It would have been better if the shipping cost wasn't more than the movie itself, but overall I got it for a good price.",1397433600,,281,3.8620689655172415
1654177,5,B00005R2EC,"All characters are believable in this drama about teen pregnancy. The film examines the dynamics of all family relationships and the effect a pregnancy will have on siblings as well as parents, who in this film, are separated. Relationships are not usually ideal in this scenario, and nearly every stock character showcases what could happen before and after the pregnancy. The once doting, soon absent boyfriend, the supportive best friend, the misunderstanding siblings and conflict driven parents all contribute to the conflict and are realistic.",1396396800,2,549,5.470588235294118

1654201,4,B00005R2EC,"Evie and Cal Spangler are a family divided. A recent separation has their children bouncing from one house to another. When their oldest daughter Tina (Kirsten Dunst) moves back in with her mother, Evie (Park Overall) feels she can finally concentrate on rebuilding her family, but Tina didn't move back alone; she has a secret that will tear her family apart.

Before Tina will get her driver's license, graduate from junior high or go to the prom, she will have a baby. Pregnant at fifteen, Tina is forced to deal with the fact that none of her friends or Ray, the father of the child, wants anything to do with her. With no strong relationships at school, and a tenuous relationship with her family, Tina decides she's in this alone.",1391040000,,736,4.661538461538462
1654202,5,B00005R2EC,We had a scare with our 16 year old daughter. She told me she thinks she's pregnant. One... I'm glad she felt comfortable to tell me. I'm not saying that I wasn't bothered. I had her take a pregnancy test and it came out positive. I told her lets watch this movie. She said mom I'm not going to learn anything from a movie. We watched the movie together. After the movie. She starts crying. I ask her why is she crying. She said I never thought of everything that would come out of this decision I made. This movie is educational. If you have a teen that is making not so good decisions. Have them watch this movie. Guaranteed they will at least learn one thing.,1386806400,,662,4.2204724409448815

1654211,5,B00005R2EC,"histria super bem contada, sem cair no clich. Contada a histria de uma garota que fica grvida quando mal completa 15 anos,ou seja, uma garota que ainda est no ensino fundamental. Uma garota bem egosta, diga-se de passagem. Sua passagem de pr-adolescente  adolescente vem acompanhada de um filho.
Mostra tambm como seus pais tentam lidar com isso. O pai deveria ter apresentado uma reao maior, tanto em relao  filha quanto ao pai da criana.
Apenas no final do filme h uma escorregada quando o pai volta para casa. Afinal no h uma justificativa para a separao, menos ainda para sua volta.
Deveria ter uma continuao, mostrando se a adolescente realmente iria amadurecer como sua amiga que tambm era me adolescente.",1245974400,,711,4.916666666666667

1654214,5,B00005R2EC,"I hate the LifeTime channel. It's not that it's considered a ""women's""channel but that it really panders to women and badly. I can't even surf past it without bleeding from the ears. And like most right thinking men, I hate Kirsten Dunst, for at least three reason. 1). She has teeth only a Brit would envy. 2). Her enormous,fat,pasty Stay Puff Marshmallow Man head. 3). She thinks the Spider-Man movies would flop without her. Really? The same Spider-Man who has been around for almost twice as long as Dunst herself has? The Spider-Man who is arguably the planet's most popular superhero? Would flop without her? Wow!

 Here's the paradox. While I hate both Lifetime and Kirsten Dunst, there is a Kirsten Dunst movie that I will watch anytime it is on Lifetime. It's called 15 and Pregnant and it's a typical after school special screed against the dangers of teen pregnancy. Kirsten Dunst cries in it. A lot. And mean as it sounds, I like watching Kristen Dunst cry. She just wallows in her misery in this movie, just rolls around in misery like a pig in slop, and it's hilarious. Anyone else I'd feel sympathetic, but because its Miss ""I'm cooler than Spider-man"" I get a kick out of it. The rest of the movie is pretty over-wrought, it's certainly no ""Juno"".  Like I said, I mostly like this movie because Dunst cries a river in it. And makes some pretty funny faces as well.

Too bad I wasn't at the premiere of Marie Antoinette.",1211846400,3,1435,4.59375
1654215,5,B00005R2EC,This movie arrived actually a day earlier than i expected.  The packaging was neat and everything was perfect.,1208736000,,110,5.111111111111111
1654216,4,B00005R2EC,This is a good film with a message for all families bringing up children - teenagers and with a good moral to it,1184371200,,112,3.9130434782608696
1654217,3,B00005R2EC,"This movie is okay overall and I've watched it several times on TV. But it's nothing new as far as the whole stereotypical ""teen girl gets pregnant"" movie. They show Tina (Kirsten's character) in the opening sequence about to do it with her boyfriend and she says, ""Don't tell me you love me if you don't mean it."" Not surprisingly he didn't reply. But it's sad that she went ahead and slept with him anyway. It shows how desperate young girls are to feel like a boy likes them, let alone loves them. It's realistic in portraying teen girls' vulnerability and also poor decision making! To make matters more dramatic, Tina's parents are separated and her younger sister and brother have their own issues because of that. So add a teen pregnancy and you've got a Lifetime movie du jour.

I think teens should watch it - if you can get past the cheesy music and predictable, overly done scenes with Tina's ""rebel without a cause"" boyfriend. It's predictable but worth watching. But I think they should have showed Tina's life AFTER she had the baby, too. Sure babies are all cute when you bring them home from the hospital but showing Tina as a teen Mom may have packed more of a punch for teen girls who still think that having a baby around is a breeze.",1182470400,5,1253,4.495614035087719
1654218,5,B00005R2EC,"This movie is a top quality Lifetime movie. Kirsten Dunst shows some early signs of her acting abilities, but it is really Park Overall's performance that steals the movie. She is classic as Evie Spengler. She shows a believeable amount of touhness (especially the scene with Teena's boyfriend on the front porch).

If you like LIfetime movies and the incomparable Park Overall, then this one is for you!!",1143072000,3,405,4.955882352941177

1654220,3,B00005R2EC,This is an ok movie. I too only like it for Kirsten Dunst. It shows nothing about what happens after the little guy is born and that kinda what irritates me. They should of at least do a sequel.,1142294400,,194,4.0
