7203812,5,B00XZCIENK,"How nice to find this well-made film which, although it purports to be a ""Christian"" film, is not too preachy or heavy on the religious aspect! It's always refreshing to find a new release that is suitable for the entire family and will entertain everyone.

Also, wonderful to see no use of the tobacco drug in the film; tobacco-free, as all films should be.",1440892800,9,358,4.59375

7203818,5,B00XZCIENK,"This was a great movie.  As a family, we all enjoyed the action and setting.  Good movies are hard to find and I have spent a small fortune trying to find good family movies.  This is one of the very few that was family friendly (for teenagers due to some violence may not be appropriate for young children- parents should preview), had action and mystery, good acting, and professionally done. It may not be a  multi-million dollar production, but it felt like it.  It was well done.  Bravo!  Keep up the good work!  I would like to see you make more movies!",1520121600,,559,4.411764705882353

7203828,5,B00XZCIENK,"My family and I enjoyed this movie very much. As with every movie, you have to pay attention from the beginning to understand the plot, as I also lost my way in it. But the action adventure in it will keep you watching it, until you catch up if you loose your way, as I did at the beginning. A very good film for the Christian and family.",1511136000,,338,3.985294117647059

7203832,5,B00XZCIENK,Great movie. Clean. Good moral. Good acting and effects considering the budget. Other Heywood movies with all the $ may outdo it in quality of acting but after it's all said and done they leave you with nothing to take with you. Entertained for a bit and it's gone. You're just left looking for the next movie. Movies like this don't just waste your time but give you something to think about and better yourself with. Need more films like this.,1503878400,,445,4.506172839506172
7203833,5,B00XZCIENK,"A fun movie for the whole family! We started it for the kids and soon we were all watching it.

7203866,4,B00XZCIENK,"An exciting historical fiction, with romance and faith mixed in tastefully. Very good acting, plot development, CG explosions, etc. This wasn't a cheaply-made movie. It would be great for a mixed group of Christians and their non-religious friends, as well as families with teens. I hope the producers create more films like this.",1492905600,,330,5.245283018867925

7203871,4,B00XZCIENK,"This is a very nice movie. My family (except for the little ones) really enjoys it. The acting, directing, and effects are not the typical cringe-worthy stuff in most Christian movies. The gospel message isn't explicitly presented, but for those who are already Christians they'll understand it just fine. Wonderful family entertainment.",1490832000,,337,5.5
7203872,4,B00XZCIENK,Good movie - clean action movie for kids,1490572800,,40,4.125
7203873,4,B00XZCIENK,"Good family story! Wish they wouldn't put so much makeup on the lead women from that time period...makes it so unrealistic and phony. Plus, our teen girls just don't need to feel that pressure to be unrealistically perfected by cosmetics.",1490313600,,238,4.975
7203874,1,B00XZCIENK,"One more for the garbage.!!! Good Movie Poster. Good Opening (5 minutes), Good Opening Special Effects... That All... Bad performances and boring action scenes. The message did not reach me ... it must have been due to the expectations that gave me the Trailer. No recomendable. I am a extreme movie lover ... Christians!!!! better... make drama films directly related to Jesus or God they are much better ... this kind of movie is better for Hollywood...",1489881600,,455,4.922077922077922
7203875,5,B00XZCIENK,NEW FAMILY FAVORITE! EXCELLENT MOVIE!,1489795200,,37,6.6
7203876,5,B00XZCIENK,"Such a fantastic movie in so many ways! Full of adventure and history, with a touch of romance thrown in. It is a clean movie with no nudity or cursing, however, there are several violent portions that would not be suitable for children. I love how the movie combines the storyline with actual historical events. They do a fantastic job with every detail - very well done! This is one of my new favorite movies!",1489708800,,411,4.493333333333333
7203877,1,B00XZCIENK,I was hoping for a more Christian movie. Not too different then most worldly movies you would see at the movie theater. There is about 2 mins that even speak of God in the whole thing. Too much romance to be appropriate for a family movie. Very disappointing and not worth watching again.,1489708800,,288,4.452830188679245

7203880,5,B00XZCIENK,"This is a good film about redemption.  It is God's grace not your endeavor.  Also, it shows that although one may not wear a physical mask, their whole life is pretense.",1487635200,,169,4.419354838709677
7203881,5,B00XZCIENK,"Short mini series full of Adventure and conviction and how Redemption ,compassion a great movie for people to watch to see how things work and their lives",1487116800,,154,4.7407407407407405
7203882,5,B00XZCIENK,A great movie!  Enough action that keeps you hanging on but not where it is frightening.  Great plot on the movie!  Highly recommend!,1487030400,,133,4.695652173913044

7203884,5,B00XZCIENK,"I got this for preteen grandchildren and didn't expect to like it myself. I was surprised! It was a great movie, quite exciting, but there are some slightly violent scenes and tense moments so not for young children. Thoroughly enjoyed by the grandchildren 10 and up.",1486252800,,267,4.826086956521739
7203885,5,B00XZCIENK,Excellent movie! Great theme! My wife and I thought the actors chosen to play in this movie were a perfect fit. Had we known it was in the theaters at the time of its release we would have gone to see it and very rarely do we do that.,1485820800,,234,3.795918367346939
7203896,4,B00XZCIENK,Very well spun story.  It's amazing that an extended home school family produced this film.  The message of redemption never grows old.  Enjoyed it very much.,1485561600,,158,5.0
7203897,5,B00XZCIENK,great movie and good price too.,1485129600,,31,4.333333333333333
7203898,5,B00XZCIENK,I agree that this is one of the better quality Christian themed movies as rated by some of the other commentators here. Truly deserves 5-stars and I do highly recommend this action-filled family movie to anyone especially true American patriots ... such as anyone who has read the Rush Limbaugh American Patriot book series.,1485043200,,324,5.018518518518518
7203899,5,B00XZCIENK,"Clean and wholesome, exciting and wonderfully inspiring.  The movie is a welcome change from the norm these days and promotes the values of our true country and American characteristics. It is unusually creative, and the music is totally awesome.

7203904,5,B00XZCIENK,"if anyone has not yet seen ""Beyond The Mask"", it is a MUST SEE! It goes so far as to say QUOTE: Only Christ can redeem a person's name ( reputation).
... The movie has LOTS of prayer and talk about God in it as well. My parents gave this movie to me for Christmas and it's a keeper.
There is a bit of blood, lots of fighting as well as things exploding. But those aspects are tastefully done.",1482624000,,392,3.9746835443037973

7203919,5,B00XZCIENK,We love this movie. Great story that illustrates the need for redemption and the provision of Christ's forgiveness. We love that historical facts are laced throughout the movie which makes it difficult to tell where history ends and the story begins (good quality in an historical fiction). My husband sometimes turns it on just to watch the bonus features.,1480291200,,357,5.067796610169491
7203920,5,B00XZCIENK,"This is one of the best movies I've watched in a long time. In fact, I just finished watching the film again for the fifth or sixth time. The casting is perfect, and the acting is superb. I particularly enjoyed watching the bonus features included, and learning more about The Burns Family Studio. I hope the Studio plans to produce many more of these adventure movies.",1480118400,,369,4.606060606060606

7203922,5,B00XZCIENK,"Love this pirate meets American history style movie!  A very cleverly written movie with great action.  I really like the way the writer's fit in pieces of American history into the story line.  Well cast, especially the Benjamin Franklin character!  I'm not used to seeing John Rhys-Davies as a ""bad guy"" but he is very good at playing one here.",1479340800,,346,4.716666666666667

7203929,5,B00XZCIENK,"We are always looking for clean entertainment and feel it's an added bonus when there is a positive moral message; however, we most often don't expect a quality production.  This movie exceeded all our expectations!  Not only was it clean and with a positive message, but the acting and cinematography were impressive.  Although not planned intentionally, this fit nicely in with our studies of early America.  It sure made talking about the revolution more interesting when explained in the context of the movie.  We will be looking forward to watching the other movie by this same production company.",1476748800,,602,5.1020408163265305

7203946,3,B00XZCIENK,"Not bad for a ""small studio"" production. Good for family viewing. Story line/plot was interesting, special effects very good considering the budget. Acting mediocre, trauma of what they went through and their recovery was completely unrealistic, in fact quite hilarious, perhaps that was the point. Christian theme/transformation of the main character was too muted, not very clear.",1472515200,,382,5.719298245614035

Other than the ONE kiss in the carriage at the end, you will not have to worry about sexual content or language :-)  Plenty of fighting, shooting, sword play, explosion stuff to keep the guys engaged... violence is a big part of the story line and blood is spilled (probably on par with the average revolutionary or civil war movie). The romance for the girls is a very classical/Christian romance kind of thing... not that I have read that kind of thing (husband writing review). Hoping for a sequel or two to spin off!

Takes place between the East India Company and Colonial America between 1774-1776, featuring interactions with Ben Franklin and even George Washington.  A real romance with true love for men and women.  The themes are redemption and overcoming challenges.  Women seem to like ""bad boys"" and this usually becomes fatal with broken hearts and worse, lasting a lifetime.  But here, the lady understands how to love but keep at a distance a bad boy trying to become good boy.  The wait and growing love between the leads is more than worth it.  Children will have two positive role models to admire, as can we who are quite a bit older.  I have not seen a positive and lovely movie like this for a long, long time.

I found it especially amazing how a follower of Christ would lay down their life for another with no questions asked and that is what it says in the bible and what Christ did. I love the journey and transformation of the main character, Will Reynolds. Yes, I would have liked to see and hear the details of the redemption Christ won for us built out more in the story.

7204012,2,B00XZCIENK,"I've seen their other feature film and while this does display improvements in a number of technical areas, it's still largely a work devoid of competent narrative writing. It's better than the other film, but not by much. They apparently got a writer who worked on a long running children's radio program. My understanding is they are episodic in nature.  I get the sense the movie was mapped out in much the same way, but the characters are still cyphers and not fully formed. The dialogue is anemic and while it's fully audible, it's not believable. The action is better in spots and there is a character who brings a lot of gravitas with hardly any lines. With all this in mind, I'm not sure how thorough a hand he had in writing for this.
They wasted their money in getting John Rhys Davies when you put him in a movie like this with nothing to do. He is the selling point of the movie and if the context of what he does, or who he is isn't believable then everything is done. A no name actor could have filled the role, making him a cypher for evil (as it should be at the bare minimum) and they could've focused on making the love story more believable.

The main character seems like a lost cause and is very thinly developed. That's the main reason the story has no weight.  I could break down in detail what makes the movie bad, but the movie doesn't warrant that. It still feels like they make movies by haphazardly plotting ideas that interest them as backdrops for action and mild Christian themes. If that's how they create and get things done I can understand not wanting to change. However, they will never make a good movie if they continue to do it this way regardless of budget.",1462320000,,1697,4.415335463258786
7204013,5,B00XZCIENK,"What a great way to watch fiction with a dash of history. As in great films like Indiana Jones, it takes real places and real events in history and tells a very fictional tale with great action and special effects.  The faith that the character's fine in Jesus Christ isn't awkward or corny but rather uplifting spiritually. Even though the story is fiction and the characters not real, finding the truth of the Gospel, their story agrees with your spirit, that Jesus paid the ultimate price, death on a cross so that we might have life and life more abundantly!

Christian themes of mercy and redemption were beautifully portrayed,but there was absolutely no ""cheesy"" moments so often present in Christian films.

7204028,1,B00XZCIENK,"Why is it that Christians think that just because a movie is produced by Christians that it has to be good?  This movie had a bad story line.  The characters were not believable and the acting was not good.  So, you have some good costumes and scenery, but that is not enough to carry a movie.  The actress who plays Charlotte looks like she stepped out of a California high school play.  Her acting is horrible.  The lead character lacks fire for someone who is supposed to be a former assassin.  He is dull.  There are also inaccuracies.  Why are they dancing the waltz when it hadn't been invented yet?  Cables running under water?  Really? Why didn't they just cut the cables?  They have to follow them to the source.  Oh, well, I bought this movie thinking it would be good, but I wasted my money.

The characters (who had better British accents than most Hollywood actors/actresses) were very well developed, and the storyline had us interested the entire time! I have to say I forgot this wasn't a Hollywood movie while I was watching it.

While they don't necessarily ""talk"" about Christianity a lot, the theme of redemption is throughout it's entirety, until it is brought to a very clear climax toward the end of the film. If you haven't realized this until that point, you understand that the main character has been trying all along, by his own works, to redeem his name. He then realizes and accepts the fact that only Christ, who has already done the work of redemption for him, can give him the new identity he has so desperately and futilely sought after. IT'S AN AWESOME MOMENT!!!

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie to anyone!!!! I hope the Burns family makes a sequal!!!!! Just a side note...my 4-year-old wants to be William Reynolds for Halloween!!! :-)",1459900800,6,1041,4.909090909090909

7204047,5,B00XZCIENK,One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I do not go to movies too often as there is so much negative actions as well as language that I do not appreciate it is a waste of my money to watch something that I regret seeing after I have paid for it. This is one a person could watch several times and not be feeling badly about spending the money to see and enjoy. Thanks Burn's Family for making it... I loved it...,1457654400,,423,3.8735632183908044
7204048,5,B00XZCIENK,"This movie was enjoyable.  It has scenes that you may not want young children to see but it is excellent in that there is no immodesty, there is no bad language, and the story line is one of turning from evil to pursue good.  Yes there are some things that critics may say aren't like Hollywood, or they are beyond there time or any number of things to pick apart, as critics always do.  But for the absence of language, the modesty of the characters and such things, yet stilled a dramatic storyline packed with action, it definitely gets 5 stars. Watch it for yourself.",1457654400,,571,4.419047619047619

7204055,5,B00XZCIENK,"This movie has elements of both historical fiction and science fiction blended together.  It is set during colonial times, on the cusp of the American Revolution.  And it opens with a trained assassin for the East India Company, wishing to resign from his position and take up the ""gentlemanly"" life, only to barely escape being murdered by his former employer.  As fate would have it, the fellow who apprises him of the bomb placed under his carriage is a vicar and when William Reynolds (the trained assassin) takes up his identity, well, he becomes a vicar whose theological training leaves some puzzled.  Unfortunately for him, his past comes back to haunt him and he ends up in America working as a printer for Benjamin Franklin.  His true love, Charlotte, the niece of his former employer who was unaware of his background, ends up in America, too.  And through a series of events, William Reynolds becomes the highwayman in America and foils the East India Company plot to bomb Philadelphia when the Declaration of Independence is declared.  It is all very compellingly done.  Sometimes, the religious themes seemed awkward and sort of forced into the movie.  I think a more subtle approach might have been better.  However, I'm glad that the movie is a clean one.  And the lead actor, Andrew Cheney, is swoonworthy.  And the lead actress, Kara Killmer, has an exciting role at times, but she doesn't quite have the gravitas to be convincing in a historical role.  She comes across as decidedly modern, despite her colonial attire.  However, the movie is an interesting one.  And a clean one.  And it leaves the ending open for further installments in the adventures of this Revoluationary War era masked underground hero.",1456704000,,1729,4.910344827586207

I was really pleased with the acting quality and the special effects--Christian movies have come a long way in quality over the last decade or so, and this one is near the pinnacle of the group! The storyline was engaging and the movie was over all quite entertaining, with a sweet message about true redemption and God's love without being heavy-handed, preachy, or overbearing about it. There were thin spots, of course, places where the story line was a little strained and the acting slipped once in a while, and a few spots where the background music didn't quite fit the scene, but none of it bad enough to pull me out of the story. The stunts were superbly done as well!

Over all, I'm thinking that if this is what these guys can do with only a little experience and a small budget, I'm looking forward to seeing what they can produce in the future, and will definitely be on the lookout!

7204114,3,B00XZCIENK,"This movie has so much potential to be a great film. The plot is good, the action sequences are great, and the acting is much better than I expected. Many Christian films are cheesy (sad, but true), but this one is pretty good. However, several things make it only three stars for me.

Perhaps the biggest drawback from a drama standpoint is the way that many key connecting links in the story go by so quickly that you miss them and are left confused. Suddenly the character is over here or over there doing this or that and you're trying to figure out why. You realize that you missed a quick half-second glimpse of some cryptic clue or muttered comment that was apparently pivotal to the story, but not pivotal enough to make sure the first-time viewer catches it. There are also too many coincidences that drive the plot, making it a little less realistic than it could be otherwise.

The biggest drawback for me was the utter lack of historical accuracy in terms of what young ladies wore and how they acted. The film writers have apparently spent zero time truly researching colonial culture or clothing for women. In scene after scene the leading lady's day-to-day behavior is full of things that simply would not have been acceptable or even thought of in that era. It's not the usual ""I'm-a-rebel"" claptrap, it's just an extreme ignorance of female societal mores in the 1700s. And her clothing and hair are horribly inaccurate. I mean absolutely, totally, appallingly, AWFUL. If you care at all about costume accuracy, it will drive you nuts. :D

7204120,3,B00XZCIENK,"Beyond the Mask Critique
by Matthew Phillips

Having watched every video provided to me as a Theater Captain, I felt my take on Beyond the Mask both as a movie and a medium for communicating the Gospel message very sound and my gitty enthusiasm warranted.

So, you might understand, how elated I was to be given an opportunity to view the full movie one time on Monday, March 16, 2015. I really felt privileged and honored to be given this consideration.

My expectations caused me to view the movie with great anticipation and hopefulness. I admit to a measured bias going into it. The previews and interviews and behind the scenes videos all depicted a professional, high definition adventure that would leave me wanting more and more.

The acting in Beyond the Mask left nothing to search for anywhere in Hollywood. The actors were believable and exquisitely competent. That combined with the fantastic computer graphics and cinematography set me in the time and circumstance of the late 1770s. A visual treat, spectacularly done lead me to a feast of color and a smorgasbord of action and romance that my senses embraced with tremendous pleasure.

At the end of the day though, a movie must tell a story. The story provides the frame on which all the other components rest and find their adhesion. It was here, at the telling of the story, that Beyond the Mask falls sharply from grace. Both in continuity and character development, Beyond the Mask left me with too many questions. I felt the writers expected me to know the answer to these questions so they purposefully left out the background information I needed to put the pieces together.

Remove only a few bones from the skeleton of a body and though still filled with muscle and covered with skin, that body will slump and sag at wherever point the removed bones no longer support its area. So it is with Beyond the Mask. It drops from moments of brilliance to lows of mediocrity like a ship being tossed on a tumultuous sea of infacility. To meet its potential both writing and directing needed to rise to its height. Unfortunately, neither met the challenge with complete success.

To ask the Christian Community to support and refer this film in its current condition seems a bit like a congregation being asked to keep a pastor because hes the cousin of the head deacon. Even though he fails in visitation, reads his sermons and drowns people in the baptismal, the congregation must support and refer him to others. OK, thats a bit unfair. But, you get the point. Were being asked to support fantastic CGI and superb acting absent equally superb and excellent storytelling simply because its Christian based. We, as Christians, must hold our highest praise and support for that which deserves it, not seeing either our loyalty to our brethren nor our need for excellence compromised in the giving of that praise and support.

Speaking of being Christian based. Beyond the Mask did present solid and believable episodic tangibility on the concepts of forgiveness and redemption. It truly moved me. However, at the one point where the opportunity arose to present the Gospel message with clarity and plausibility as the main character was forced to face his inability to achieve the change he so desired, the writers and director decided to let it pass without much attention. We, once again, find ourselves forced to know the Gospel message, its impact and residual effect once Jesus takes our name and give us His. I found myself unsettled by the lack of willingness to present the Gospel message with the whole movie designed to lead me to that one moment!

Beyond the Mask achieves a great deal in areas where other Christian movies fail. However, it undermines and insulates where other Christian movies succeed. With the characters better defined and the story more definitively told, Beyond the Mask would out achieve the best hollywood has to offer. I am saddened to say - as presented - it falls short of that goal.",1450137600,4,3989,4.8201754385964914
7204121,5,B00XZCIENK,"This is a surprisingly GREAT movie!  We are Christians but feel that most Christian movies out there are a bit too preachy.  We're not looking to be ""saved"" by a movie.

It has action and love, characters you love and hate, is pretty interestingly set within a time of historical significance, and oh yeah, has a nice Christian message as well.  We thought the acting, script, and filming were all very impressive, being that it's not from one of the top-name film studios with money to burn.",1450051200,,589,4.4672897196261685
7204122,5,B00XZCIENK,"As usual, opinions widely vary. I wonder if some of the reviewers watched the dvd extras to see
how much thought, time and effort and expense went into the making of this movie. I believe this film is
an improvement over the Burns' family previous work which I also thoroughly enjoyed.
  I consider the acting in Beyond the Mask to be superb, the scenery and costumes very authentic.
The romance is sweet and is what holds the fast-paced action scenes together. The spiritual
message of redemption was carefully brought out and is actually what the story is all about.
I think this is a movie that the whole family can enjoy, especially older children who are already
exposed to TV/movie violence, yet need to see a show that has the redeeming quality of forgiveness.",1449878400,4,767,4.7164179104477615

I was expecting a cheesy Christian movie, and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the good theology.  Although not historically accurate, it wasn't corny...you can tell I had very low expectations, even after watching the trailer.

Without giving anything away, Beyond the Mask is a very engaging movie with good music, actors, sets, and special effects.  Guys will like the action, and girls will like the heartfelt moments that aren't too mushy.  When it got to the end, I wanted a sequel!  The Christian elements of the movie fit naturally into the development of the story, and are expressed in real, compelling way.  It wasn't a tacky after thought add-on or a one long preaching scene with bits of movie thrown in the mix.  Now I will go tell others to buy or rent this movie!",1448496000,,914,4.814102564102564

It is also from a different perspective than most films. The female lead is captivating and a really good actress.

It's a decent movie, but there are a lot of cheesy parts and quite a few annoying plot gaps and places where I just couldn't help rolling my eyes or even groaning with annoyance. It may be more wholesome than a lot of action films, but brilliant it is not.

The story line also was very good, except I found the climax to be a little too weird for the setting.  This story is based during the Revolutionary War era, and the basic plot line, where the hero has a past of crime that he seeks to escape, develops fine.  But at the ending the villain was going to blow up the Second Continental Congress with a giant bomb, and the hero came in at the last minute to stop the evil scheme.  Of course, the villain, after a fight with the hero, is destroyed by the very machine of destruction that he had devised.  The climax seemed a little too much like trying to turn  it into a 1700s vintage of James Bond, which I did not feel fit the setting well.",1447027200,2,793,4.184210526315789

What the best part for us though was we are studying this time period in history right now, so that made it all the more fun.

7204189,1,B00XZCIENK,"I bought this for my 13 year old who is really into history and liberty. Since it was rated PG, I thought as a treat one night she would really enjoy it. Apparently she did not.

She was not at all fond of this film. She has seen many kids films on the revoloution but since they are for children, the violence was all hinted to. However, in this film, she could not handle the blood. She was not used to seeing this in person.

Another issue she had, was with the story line. She discribed that there was a focus on the romance aspect a little more then the history in itself.

As a grownup wanting to see a good movie, this might be an idea choice. However, I did not see it. This was for my gril. From a child's perspective, she was not at all happy with this film. It was to mature for her and foucse on the topic of freedome as a subtopic. Not for kids.

7204232,2,B00XZCIENK,"'A' for effort but unfortunately not a very good film. I very much like the premise of this movie both in plot and ambition. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend spending money on it. The most interesting parts of the plot tend to take place off screen (such as what the main character was engaged in India). He starts off to likable and therefore the arc of the character is too shallow. The acting is rough at best and the sets are unreal. Finally, I have to say that the history is atrocious and clearly very little research was done. I hope this studio gets better at making movies because I believe what they are trying to do is wonderful. They just missed this time.",1444953600,7,669,4.4471544715447155

My kids and I liked this movie a lot--it had great action, a sweet (if somewhat unrealistic) love story, and an interesting plot.  A lot of Christian-made films hit you over the head with ""accept Jesus as your personal saviour"" stereotypes, but this one didn't--in fact, I thought the gospel presentation could have been made *more* explicit, especially when the villain is about to meet his Maker!  All in all, though, we had a great time at the theater, and I'm happy to support the filmmakers by buying the Blu-ray edition.  We'll be watching it for years to come!",1444608000,,597,4.823529411764706
7204243,3,B00XZCIENK,"I confess to being excited that a Christian film group would try tackling the historical adventure genre. Beyond the Mask, however, is rather disappointing. Having seen it, I am very suspicious of reviews who give it 5 stars. If one accepts that Ben-Hur is a 5 star movie, then the three stars I'm giving this film should be considered generous indeed. Beyond the Mask just doesn't work very well.

The acting is rather flat, except for a little bit of life from the man playing Ben Franklin. Even John Rhys-Davies, a very competent actor usually, came off poorly here. The action sequences are uninspired, and lazily filmed (and the ""carriage bomb"" sequence made no sense at all). The location shooting isn't very interesting.  The score is pedantic. Turning from history to what is more like Science Fiction toward the end was just silly.

I think I was most disappointed in the script.  Paul McCusker's work is known to me as one of the best writers on the radio drama Adventures in Odyssey. I think he's enormously talented. None of that talent shows here. Maybe his screenplay was repeatedly worked over in production...who knows?  I was simply amazed at the sequence of the hero pretending to be a minister giving his first sermon. What an opportunity for some real humor! It fell completely flat...horribly flat. That wasn't very far into the movie, and it never recovered.

This is fantasy pure and simple.  If you get hung up on historical inaccuracies or things not being realistic, then you won't enjoy this movie.
If you can or do enjoy fantasy you will likely find this time well spent.
The story consists of action, a love story, and the Gospel message which is well told without seeming to be inserted or contrived.
The acting is (for the most part) great.
A few reviewers complained about scenes reminiscent of the ""Wild,Wild West"".  That is a fair characterization, but I enjoyed that aspect... This is fantasy after all.
It is a low budget production and at times that shows, however for the most part, the story and the acting helps one over-look those short-comings.

We are definitely recommending it to our friends.  We are so glad we stumbled across it. We have put it in our film library so we can watch it again. It was an instant family favorite.

I must admit that I'm not usually a fan of 'Christian movies', because they many times seem to ram the idea down our throats so much that there isn't really anything else for the movie to stand on. This movie, however, has the idea woven subtly behind and within everything else, every now and then shining just a little brighter. And that's how I feel Christianity really is-- something that is mixed in with everything else that is our lives, Sure, it's obvious there is no huge, Hollywood budget behind the making of this movie, but that doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable just the same.

The acting was uneven (the man who played George Washington projected as much authority as the second runner-up for class president.) The lead was serviceable. The leading lady couldn't decide whether she wanted to speak in a modern manner, or as one in the 18th century. She certainly didn't behave as a maiden of some station in the 18th century.

Near the end, the script goes all Jules Verne on us. And I felt like I was watching an 18th century version of The Green Hornet with some Wild, Wild, West thrown in for good measure. That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but it just doesn't work.

You can watch it, and appreciate that it is reasonable family fare, but when you are done, yo are done. It doesn't stay with you. For well done movies of this genre, I'd go back a few years to ""The Scarlet and the Black"" or ""The Great Escape"".",1443225600,8,914,4.434523809523809

7204320,3,B00XZCIENK,"Warning! There are 2 spoilers ahead.

The castle, scenery, and costumes are beautiful.

The twist at the 12th minutes is thrilling. I did not see it coming.

The love story is complicated, touching and full of witty dialogues i.e. the scene when William Reynolds (played by Andrew Cheney) asks Charlotte Holloway (played by Kara Kilmers) to marry him.

The first 45 minutes are riveting because all the reasons listed above.

For the next 15 minutes, it looks very much like The Mask of Zorro. However, the acting and action scenes of this film  are not as good as the one starring Antonio Banderas. From the 60th minute till the end, it breaks out of the Zorro mold by adding the scientific scene of creating electricity and remotely detonating bombs.

Most of the hand- to-hand fighting scenes look ridiculously fake.

The plot is original to me. Ive never seen something like this before but its not logical. Its more like a family movie than an adult.

John Rhys-Davies is very convincing while playing the villain, Charles Kemp.  He makes the movie more intriguing.
Kara Kilmers acting is touching in the role of Charlotte Holloway.
Andrew Cheney s acting is okay in the role of William Reynolds.

In short, the love story makes this movie worth watching.",1442966400,,1260,4.813953488372093
7204321,5,B00XZCIENK,"This is a pseudo history of the beginning of the American Revolution that is part ZORRO and part WILD WILD WEST. It is a love story, and love stories are the best stories.(I heard that in another film.)

William Reynolds (Andrew Cheney) is a paid assassin for the East India Company working for Charles Kemp (John Rhys-Davies). They have a falling out and William starts another life and ends up courting Charlotte Holloway (Kara Killmer) his niece. Charlotte breaks up with him because he is William Reynolds and not Ryan Reynolds. Then we all go to Philadelphia 1776 where we encounter Alan Madlane in what was the worst portrayal of Benjamin Franklin since Bill Franey in 1924. It was written either for or by a five year old.

Now as you watch the film, you might wonder how much of this story is true...don't think too hardas they give you the highlights at the end, like there was a Philadelphia and an East India Company. Later they would name a ship after Charlotte and it would be discovered by Nicolas Cage and blown up by Sean Bean.

This is a good family film, unless your kid is taking a class in American history. 4 1/2 stars. Franklin was really bad.",1442966400,,1165,4.538095238095238

7204331,3,B00XZCIENK,"Fully disclosure: I am a filmmaker. I've been in films with budgets of 28M, so my eye is particularly keen for film. First off, this is an EXTREMELY ambitious film for a budget of $4M dollars. Seriously that is insane and frankly I would have never have attempted a film like this with that low of a budget because I would know before I started that I didn't have enough to do it justice. This film needed $20M minimum to really give justice to the costumes, visual effects, talent pool, et. al. Doors that look too modern, a shovel in the background that looks just like the one in my garage, etc. These things distract the viewer and the average moviegoer will feel something off but not know exactly why. That said, this was very impressive for the money. And here I will applaud the effort for a film with liberty and Christian themes. We need more of them and this is worth a watch and worthy of support for that reason alone. Kids will love this movie. Adults will be like it 50/50 in my view. If they are up on the most current films, they may be a little bored at times. The plot for me was fairly predictable and it was pretty slow. It feels more like a made-for-TV or a straight-to-Bluray movie rather than a theatrically released movie. But give it a shot.",1442534400,6,1267,4.350210970464135

While this is not obviously a movie with a budget of millions of dollars and shown on thousands of movie screens, it was very well done, well produced and the action and effects have progressed a long way from earlier small-budget Christian movies.  We saw this movie at one of the limited movie theater showings and liked it just as much as just about any movie we've seen in the theater.  The best part is that it's completely clean in terms of sexuality and language, which is increasingly becoming harder to find.  Seems that the big movie people always try to throw in one or two curse words or some lingering shot of some body parts that are completely unnecessary and add nothing to the movie.  Maybe Beyond the Mask can help some of the big-movie people to realize that if they would just leave that crap out, their potential audience would be larger and it wouldn't hurt their movie at all.",1442275200,2,949,4.5588235294117645

I've have been listening to it in anticipation of the movie, thinking that if the soundtrack is this good, the movie, plot and acting has got to be good too. Well, I was not disappointed!  What a remarkable movie! For my part, it was the best acting I've ever seen in a ""Christian"" movie. And I was drawn in, even touched with the sweet realistic way the hero's salvation unfolded.  My husband who is super particular about his action movies, really liked this --and hopes for a sequel. Whoever wrote this has a unique gift. The romance was beautifully done.

The movie is a swashbuckling, action-packed period piece with touches of steampunk and even a little splash of alternate history(!), which I wasn't expecting.  The main characters are engaging and the whole cast does a great job.  The special effects work quite well, and the film is really rather gorgeous in palate.  That this is an independent movie is pretty amazing, as the whole thing was rather ambitious.  There was a Christian message in there, but, honestly, it does not feel like a Christian independent movie project at all in the classic (read: hokey, low budget and kind of lame) ways.  It is possible that if you blink, you could miss the message-delivery or mistake it for part of the period nature of the flick, actually.  Finding the message in there or not, this was a fun film that did not disappoint for a night out at the movies looking for an audacious blockbuster with humor, explosions, villains to hate, and protagonists to root for.

7204382,5,B00XZCIENK,"I really liked this movie. I saw it on pay per view. I enjoyed the secretive, big business controlling, self serving greedy plot concept set during the revolutionary war era, which itself was a clever and refreshing change from the same old day to day and dismal, futuristic stories of late. The fictional plot was written and weaved actual historical figures and events combined with early science. It was creative, well done and fun. Direction and acting was good as was the staging, CGI and special effects. Some of the main cast were familiar from TV roles an all were solid. John Rhys-Davies can always be counted on for a strong, dramatic and when needed, a somewhat energetic performance; he was at his bombastic best here as the villain of the story. Beyond the Mask won't win an Oscar but is was better than many of the over hyped, bigger budget movies of this genre I have seen lately. The movie was well paced and entertaining. It's a real interesting era for a movie like this, I hope they come out with a sequel. As an added note, I have seen some reviews that add this mumbo jumbo about Christian views, etc.  I didn't get that vibe at all.

  The plot follows William Reynolds (Andrew Cheney), a man who was, until five minutes into the film, an assassin for the East India Trading Company. Deciding to resign, Reynolds makes himself the enemy of a powerful man: his former employer (John Rhys-Davies), a ruthless businessman who will stop at nothing to carry out his evil plans. While on the run, things change when Reynolds meets a beautiful woman (Kara Kilmer) who knows nothing of Reynolds' violent past.
  While being a clean, enjoyable film containing Christian messages and themes, the acting and production were of higher quality than most ""christian"" movies out there. I would recommend this as a perfect family night film.",1440979200,103,903,5.081081081081081
8717119,4,B00XZCIENK,"This was fun to watch! I wish they made more American History-based movies like this one that are family-friendly! I loved that this movie didn't have any sex and nudity, and that it had a faith-based message! The only reason I am giving it 4 out of 5, is because there was a pretty big plot hole that my husband noticed, otherwise, we loved it! It was so nice that they made a Christian action movie, because my husband has a harder time with the dramas.",1535068800,,455,4.3023255813953485

8717122,5,B00XZCIENK,"It's been a while since I loved a film.  This one I love.  I watched it on July 7 after the 4th of July just by chance.  I had no idea it was a Christian film.  It was not overtly religious ... it was just beautiful and made the story real and meaningful even though the story was fiction.

I was entranced throughout the entire film.  It was romantic, exciting, creative, funny, a period-type piece .... everything I love.  The actors I thought were perfect.

It had something different about it - not the usual hollywood junk.  After watching all the bonus films at the end, I found out why.

A great movie for young and old (I'm old).",1530921600,,637,4.277310924369748
