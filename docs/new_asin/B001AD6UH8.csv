8311655,5,B001AD6UH8,"My favorite Dracula movie!  T&A, atmosphere, and Paul Naschy!",1508284800,,61,5.777777777777778
8311656,3,B001AD6UH8,"After seeing this, I remember watching it years ago on TV. It's not what I thought it was, and I probably wouldn't have purchased it if I'd remembered before watching it that I'd seen it already, but if you're a B movie horror fan it's still not bad and worth a look-see. It's typical of the low-budget horror films of the late 60s and early 70s. I would guess it was released direct to drive-in theaters. Really, it's probably a film only for vampire aficionados. Otherwise, you could give it a miss and not leave a gap in your life. On the other hand, it's definitely a unique take on the vampire story, so as I said, it's worth a look-see.",1477958400,,642,4.31404958677686
8311657,3,B001AD6UH8,"The sides of the screen have been cut from the original in order to fit old SD TV format, the video freezes for a split second every once in awhile (not a problem with my streaming) Would loved to see this remastered into HD sad to let works of art like this just stay in rotted condition. If I'd known the lousy condition of the video, I would have probably not wasted my money but this is typical of Sinister Cinema they have many many great old B classics that should be restored but instead sell them in the crap condition they bought them in..",1465430400,,548,4.228571428571429
8311658,1,B001AD6UH8,"Awful release, AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Sinister's DVD print is taken from an old VHS source, is badly cropped and even darker and more unwatchable than the very poor Shout Factory Elvira DVD version, plus it's missing a few seconds of the films start !! A totally pointless product.",1422230400,,278,4.6938775510204085
8311659,5,B001AD6UH8,"Again, typical of the genre and always fun to watch something that is very bad form by today's standards but brings back memories to those of use over the hill.",1405468800,,160,4.366666666666666
8311660,5,B001AD6UH8,"This being one of Jacinto Molinas Early Waldamer Daninsky films, it is a look into his extraordinary acting career and the sheer delight of watching an under rated actor and film see the light of day, however brief.... These movies are gems, people. Really, all joking aside. If you enjoy the films of Paul Naschy and seem to understand them and can't quite figure out why they delight you so then fear not.... enjoy them. They are special. Really...",1366156800,,450,4.708860759493671
8311661,2,B001AD6UH8,Sadly this movie makes no sense the timeline do not match the movie and the acting is plan awful save your money see it on u. Tube,1366156800,,130,3.8518518518518516
