2727674,5,B000005XXH,I first saw this film as a child and it opened my mind up to a subject I never thought about previously.  This masterpiece is the ultimate dramatazation of how man's rise would come to affect the world.  If you  watch this movie you will see a good interpretation of how those hominids  who gave way to Homo Sapiens struggled to survive.  I think most viewers  will gain insight into their own lives and learn how they came to be.  This  film is one of a kind and a must-have.,952905600,,476,4.211111111111111
2727675,3,B000005XXH,"I caught this film late at night on t.v.  It is completely different than what the cover suggests.  However, it is interesting to see how a ""one character"" film can be pulled off.  It is an often sad film, but the  lonely ""Link"" (as I refer to him) had some amusing moments.  Watch for the scene in which he eats berries and they have a bombastic  gastrointestinal result!  Not a bad film, just different.",938649600,,405,4.391891891891892

Please let me know when you change that price because I'll buy it thanks",1509753600,,270,3.754385964912281

8167361,4,B000005XXH,"I taped this about 20 years ago thinking it was a horror film and am just now getting around to watching it.  Surprisingly, the VHJ has survived very well. Without all the ""Nature footage"" the actual story could probably be encapsulated into 15 minutes.  Man-Ape, the missing link, is the only survivor of a massacre of his entire tribe by Man, who has evolved to discover fire, lethal weapons, and is apparently out to kill anything different from himself. Man-Ape is left for dead but survives, finding a stone club left behind and he drags it along with him though he has no idea what it's for.  He sets out in an aimless trek, searching for...what?  The narrator first says he's the last of his race, then that he's hunting more of his kind.  If it's the former, it can't be the latter. Whatever he's searching for, he doesn't find it and at the end, appears to be simply waiting to be annihilated by Man.

In spite of Man-Ape's family being killed, humans don't really appear in the story except in two long shots as slender, naked figures, and a single bare arm raising and bringing down the stone club striking Man-Ape. They never chase or attack him again in spite of his fleeing across what appears to be all of Africa to the ocean.

There's no dialogue except for the narrator but there's plenty of thought-provoking scenes, such as Man-Ape's sudden enlightment of what the thing he's carrying is really designed to do... His experience with a hallucination-producing plant... His pain at seeing his mate and child dead... Even a little humor as his farting scares off an animal.  We can only guess how creatures such as he lived but this might be a good approximation...a fairly aimless existence...foraging, moving about, having enough intelligence to exhibit grief and humor and acceptance but not enough to make tools or weapons or fire.

The initial scene states this takes place in Africa one million years ago.  Consequently, my initial reaction was to wonder if the African veldt back then would look much as it does today, and if giraffes, lions, meerkats, and all the animals we associate with that country now would've evolved to their current forms by 1,000,000 BC.  The ""Nature"" continuity footage is vibrant and realistic...an antelope giving birth, a lion attacking a zebra foal and being driven off by its mother, a newborn fawn being killed, lions feasting on the corpses of Man-Apes family.

If you're expecting action and dialogue, go elsewhere. This is a thoughtful film which shows how it might have been and the viewer is going to be empathetic to Man-Ape's plight as he wanders over plain, desert, and ocean shore clutching the weapon which killed his mate, not making the connection between the stone tied to a stick and her dead body until the last scene.  That might be my only argument, giving him the nobility to destroy the thing which is a weapon though he's come to realize it can also be used as a tool (he uses it to crack ostrich eggs) and the acceptance to calmly sit and supposedly wait for Man to discover and kill him, too Although this movie dogmatically blames Man for every extinction occuring, it can be argued there were many other causes, such as survival of the fittest and natural selection which brought about the disappearance of many species, including the missing link.

Peter Elliott, who specializes in portraying gorillas and ape-like creatures does a tour-de-force as the solitary actor, bringing more than humanity to this part.",1403913600,,3493,4.790349417637271
8167362,5,B000005XXH,"A gentle man-ape, a Australopithecus Robustus, played by Peter Elliott is on the run after his people are wiped out by some Homo Ergaster.  The film is known for two things.  One is just how well the actor played the prehistoric character.  The second is that by filming in Africa, and leaving out dinosaurs and bikini-clad women, the film comes across as realistic, for a non-documentary film.  The modern day animals, many of which would have been around during the same time period as the setting, adds a LOT to the feeling of the film.  So does the setting of an African plain.  At one point there is a storm in the background and the man-ape shakes his arms at the grumbling clouds.  When nature becomes part of the story it just adds so much to the scenes and emotions.  I truly enjoyed it even if the story is, in the end, somewhat simple and sentimental.
Try to get it - seems to be only available on VHS, sad to say.",1333670400,,925,4.368421052631579
8167363,5,B000005XXH,"Although I had always heard of missing links in the human species, I had not imagined what the beginning trials would be.
Pleasantly surprised yet sad to see even in the beginning we each evolve differently...some not as kindly as we might want.
This video was thought provoking and interesting to follow.  Each of us should realize the trials and things we learn from life do take time to master. Yet what we do with what we learn is totally up to each individual.
Enjoy the world as it could have started, purchase ""Missing Link.""

8167364,1,B000005XXH,"The philosophical premise is that we Humans are evil and violent, and this was first manifest when we genocidally exterminated our competitors some X Million Years Ago.  And we should feel guilty about it.  This is brought home (one might say ""hammered"" home) in a written closing statement.  The movie delivers an injury to the viewer's moral worth and dignity; with the written moral, it adds an insult to the viewer's comprehension.

This movie could earn a second Star for the cinematography, visual compositions and depictions of the animal world.  But while these are revelatory and stunningly beautiful, they are squandered on a misguided and brainlessly moralistic world view.  The ""misguided"" aspect wouldn't have kept it from making it into DVD (many college students in America and Europe agree today with the movie's ""original sin"" theme), but I've got to guess the ""brainlessly moralistic"" part was severe enough to do so.",1252195200,,935,5.158940397350993

8167366,4,B000005XXH,"I first saw this movie when I was about 10 and I loved it. I've always been interested in evolution and early humans. ""Missing Link"" takes place in Africa, 1 Million years ago. There is a tribe of Australopithecus robustus living together (referred to as ""the man-apes"" in this film). The film focuses on one male robustus. He returns to his tribe to find them slaughtered, including his mate and child. He himself is attacked and left for dead by more advanced black humans (possibly Homo Erectus, who lived in Africa at the same time.) Now the last of his kind, the man-ape must find a new place to live and keep away from any of the Homo Erectus (who are constantly on the look-out for him). He has a very hard life afterwards, looking for food and water and nearly dying from heat stroke and dehydration. The film blends with some awesome nature scenes. After all, Africa 1 million years ago is not that different from the Africa of today. Parts of the movie are funny and some are sad. Australopithecus robustus was ultimately a dead-end in human evolution. At certain points in time, there were more than one species of humans living together. Nature had to make several attempts at human evolution; if nature only made one attempt and if it failed then there would be no humans today. Human evolution continued through Homo Erectus (like the ones in the film). Modern humans are descended from them.",1088208000,,1406,4.650602409638554
8167367,5,B000005XXH,"I just chanced to see this movie several years ago and was blown away by it.  Some of the nature scenes were so strange that I really was not sure they were real at first.  It presents some very interesting ideas about humanity and also about drugs.  I almost never care to see a movie more than once but have probably watched this one a dozen times.  The actor who plays the ""link"" really had an opportunity to be creative and does a fantastic job of being nearly human.",976838400,,471,4.258426966292135
