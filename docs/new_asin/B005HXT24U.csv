8473973,2,B005HXT24U,Evil Unleashed:THeMummy is the best out of several films produced around the year 2000 to showcase a home 3D system that was only good for tube sets and that the company who made these movies were involved in. That form of 3D produced a heavy flicker which has been removed with present technology but technology can't alter the fact that this is a cheesy potted meat of a movie with bad porn actors and even worse dialogue and plots. It's funny in parts and excruciating in others. It is decidedly better than the co-feature The Zombie Chronicles which has absolutely no budget except for the dicey zombie make up. Your ten year old kid could write a better film than this and with a home 3D camera you could probably make a better movie as well. Get these used at a good price only if you really like 3D ore wish to break the monotony of current family entertainment offered on current 3D blu ray as they do contain nudity and gore.,1344988800,2,934,4.436046511627907
