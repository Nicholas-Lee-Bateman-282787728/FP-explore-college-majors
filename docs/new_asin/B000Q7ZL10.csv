8195134,5,B000Q7ZL10,"I got this for my son who's had a few developmental delays. These DVDs really helped him. My son loves the DVDs, but even more so, often requests the bonus CDs that come with it. They make him very happy when we listen to them in the car.

I think these DVDs are targeted towards children on the Autism Spectrum, but honestly, ALL children could benefit from this music therapy DVD.",1253145600,,382,4.380281690140845
8195135,5,B000Q7ZL10,"My 3 year old son was just diagnosed with Autism. My mother bought him the Bounce dvds and he just loves them. He has only watched them a few times and he is singing the songs throughout the day without being prompted, and he also talks about his routines as he is doing them. The music is simple and not annoying and the whole dvd holds his attention very well. I really think that these are a wonderful source of therapy because of the music and the way they word the songs! This comes HIGHLY recommended and if I could give it more stars I would!!!",1238112000,,551,4.2075471698113205
8195136,4,B000Q7ZL10,"Bounce: Routines! by Bounce
Bounce: Let's Talk! by Bounce

I purchased two of these DVD movies (Routines & Let's Talk) for a young family member who is 6 years old & is non-verbal.  She seems to really enjoy watching these DVD's & stays glued to the TV while they are on. I am hoping that they will start to help her make some progress as time goes on. The fact that she shows such an interest in them says something in itself.  I am glad that I chose to make this purchase.",1234569600,2,474,4.130434782608695
8195137,5,B000Q7ZL10,"It is worth every penny. It is very educational and joyful. Elizabeth's voice is really nice, that I become sleepy myself when i listen to the good night song. I have almost all the baby and little Einstein collection, and many other educational DVDs, but i found Bounce to be the best, and i will buy the rest of this collection.",1228089600,2,330,4.426229508196721
8195138,5,B000Q7ZL10,I hit the jackpot when I purchased this video. One of my grandchildren was diagnosed with autism and the other was not. One is 3yrs old with the diagnosis and his sister is 4years old. The music is catchy and alive. The lessons are remarkable. I bought several others with the same reception as this one. They love Elizabeth and all the children in the video. My three year old grandson loves to jump on the rebounder as he is listening to the video. I recommend this and all the Bounce video for children diagnosed with autism and other pre-schoolers and children into the first grade. Excellent work the music therapist is doing. It does help the children alot. Hope this company keeps producing these videos.,1223164800,5,711,4.650793650793651
8195139,5,B000Q7ZL10,"My child is not even on the spectrum, but the Bounce DVDs are a huge hit in our house.  Elizabeth's songs are fantastic -- they don't drive you nuts like other kid-tunes.  And the themes of all the DVDs teach coping skills and behaviors that can benefit ALL children.  It is so nice to see a DVD like this that actually uses REAL kids rather than wall-to-wall cartoons and none of that strange, psychedelic animation that seems to be the trend.  If your child is a late talker, or just shy, or just likes great music to jump around to, then the Bounce DVDs are the best that money can buy.  How many ways can I praise this series?  Can I give it more stars than five?  And when on earth are they going to add more episodes??  Kids and parents are waiting...",1222387200,,757,4.244755244755245
8195140,5,B000Q7ZL10,"My daughter loves the Bounce DVDs and CDs. We find they are enjoyable,fun to watch. Elizabeth begins by telling how to know when the end has arrives,that is so helpful when doing any activity. She has a great goodnight song.
  We play the CD at bedtime and it has really helped our daughter settle in quicker and sleep better ( less night waking).",1210982400,5,347,4.492063492063492
8195141,5,B000Q7ZL10,"We fell in love with the Bounce songs and Elizabeth after seeing them on PBS Sprout.  I got the Routines DVD and can't say enough about it.  Bounce is like a music class based around a theme.  Elizabeth is the teacher and she has kids in her class.  There's songs about routines, like a song about what you do in the morning and cleaning up.  There's also a wonderful song about safety which is fun and wonderful and we all sing it when crossing the street.  Also a song about called the Good Night song about how to fall asleep - and it works!  In the show, you see ELizabeth and the kids in the classroom and when they start singing a song we see the lyrics being acted out.  There's also fun things after each song, like quizzes that my kids go nuts over.  THe best thing about Bounce is that it's educational but it's just as entertaining.  And the songs are REALLY excellent.  One of the best things is that the dvd came with a CD also with all the songs from the show on it and we play it everywhere.  An extra bonus for me is that both my girls (2 and a half and five years old) LOVE Bounce and they can share it together. I am so glad that I found Bounce.  We also have the LET'S GO dvd which is just as great as the Routines show (the going to the doctor song is priceless.  I am getting the other ones too that I just found.  By the way - Elizabeth is a music therapist and this DVD is for all kids on all levels.  THUMBS UP!",1191628800,10,1435,4.017667844522968
