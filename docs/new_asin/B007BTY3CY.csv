8514094,2,B007BTY3CY,"This is a 7 hour film of a somewhat precious play by Paul Claudel. OK. I knew that. But it is not advertised as Region 2 - so I tried to watch it on a PC. No subtitles - not even French subtitles!  Rather static and artsy - OK, it's by Manoel de Oliveira, and written by Paul Claudel, so nothing so bad about that. But I need at least French subtitles! On a 5K retina, it didn't look great. This from a reviewer who is motivated to learn more about Paul Claudel!",1494028800,,462,3.967741935483871
