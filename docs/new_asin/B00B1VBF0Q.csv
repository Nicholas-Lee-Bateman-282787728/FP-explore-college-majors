8561118,5,B00B1VBF0Q,"I have watched many self-help and spiritual videos over the years and this ranks right at the top. Clearly the creator of this work understands the requirement for each and every person to find ways to dialogue with the mystery of one's own life experience and how the journey is both unique to the person, yet universal for all. I loved the ability for a chance to stop and reflect after each short subject section. This is not to be rushed through. I personally would recommend it be watched and discussed in a small group. Although you can do solitary reflection, when you are in a group it is the personal stories that others tell that touches the soul and allows a deeper personal appreciation. I look forward to the future videos in this series. The editing is superb!",1367452800,2,774,4.575539568345324
8561119,5,B00B1VBF0Q,"Thank you for the beauty, integrity and wonder of disclosing the world of spirit as universal, secular and scientific.  I can not imagine your ... is it tenacity?  spiritual suffering and ease? or what - that has allowed you, your family and colleagues to visually and simply express such wonder.  It could be presented to any culture in any language.  Awesome is an understatement!

Right now we 'visit' one station a week, then follow the manual for individual reflection and then share our experiences.  This adds a new and dynamic spirit element to our marriage, and our ability to share these realities with others.

Gratefully, Ken Fisher, Sharbot Lake, ON Canada",1367366400,2,669,4.972972972972973
8561120,4,B00B1VBF0Q,"Having a bad week, a tough year? Wondering if a different perspective on your troubles might help you find a way through?  Yet you feel those very problems seem to be preventing you from having the time to discover new paths that you know are out there. ""Life Journey #1,"" first of an expected series, under the title of The Ultimate Encounter, might be just what you are looking for. This DVD is divided into 12 brief sections of about 10 minutes each. While best watched in sequence, each segment also stands on its own. They are non religious, visually gorgeous and subtly intellectual vignettes that enable you to quietly and privately contemplate about your own experience of life in relation to what is going on all around you. ""Life Journey's"" images and stories can be a breath of fresh air, not solving your problems, but giving you a whole new perspective on living life a day at a time out of a context much grander than you had ever realized was possible. It just might be the best $25 you have spent in a long time. (I never rate anything with 5 stars, but this DVD is pretty close.)",1365292800,2,1096,4.48
8561121,5,B00B1VBF0Q,"A welcome shift took place in my life after viewing and processing the messages in this video series. I learned that each and every one of us already knows how to connect to the real, the deep, the oneness available at all times.  This oneness allows for wholeness and a new perspective about life and its ups and downs.  I'm finding that laughter is now filling those spaces once reserved for anger, disappointment, and agitation.",1364428800,2,431,4.733333333333333
8561122,5,B00B1VBF0Q,"If you are seeking more in life than superficial pursuits of popular culture, endless consumerism and hollow sentimental traditions, then you will love the Ultimate Encounter"". This is for anyone with the courage to explore depth consciousness and meaning in today's modern world.  A powerful forum and discussion that takes one on an amazing inward journey that is not dependent on narrow doctrines and rigid belief systems.",1364428800,2,425,5.343283582089552
8561123,5,B00B1VBF0Q,"Have you ever longed to talk about the great deep questions of life without getting bogged down in religion? This is a beautiful series of 12 short videos exploring the ancient great questions using post-modern imagery and language. It can be used for individual exploration or as the basis of conversation groups (the DVD calls them ""story circles""). It draws on a wide variety of source material - Joseph Campbell, Lao-tzu, Gene Marshal, Nikos Kazanstakis, and interviews with regular people from many walks of life. One of the features I've enjoyed the most as I move through the 12 ""stations"" of the journey is that no one is claiming to have all the answers - only to be actively engaged in questions. I look forward to continuing the journey.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Encounter/dp/B00B1VBF0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Encounter</a>",1362355200,2,908,5.7835820895522385
8561124,5,B00B1VBF0Q,"The Ultimate Encounter is 'art' at its best -- substantive content masterfully illustrated by compelling imagery, all aimed at engaging the viewer in thought-provoking dialogue with others as well as self. I so appreciate the hours and hours of creative energy and ""heart"" that have been invested in this project. This work illumines topics as big as the universe, yet inspires understanding and action at the most intimate and personal level.  A ""must see"" if you're seeking a deeper relationship with Life all around you!",1362009600,4,523,5.152941176470589
8561125,5,B00B1VBF0Q,"If you wonder what Life is about--what is Real? If you wonder about your place in this world. If you are looking for deeper connection & contemplation . . . experience this! It is about waking up, listening, being present, the silence, stillness, and being a contemplative. You will have much to ponder! I love how it guided me to think deeply about my journey & who I am, and what is my connection to it All. You won't be the same after experiencing this!",1361923200,4,456,4.376470588235295
8561126,5,B00B1VBF0Q,"Over the past weekend I have made time to view the set of 12 sections that make up The Ultimate Encounter DVD, twice.

One highlight is the broad selection of quotes from spiritual giants like Joseph Campbell, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Nikos Kazantzakis, Mother Teresa, The Dalai Lama, Karen Armstrong, Joseph W. Mathews, Thich Nhat Hanh, Thomas Merton, Martin Luther King, Eckhart Tolle, Ken Wilber and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.  These voices, and many others, are woven into a fabric that is helping me re-discover the power of contemplation within my self and perhaps among several interested neighbors.

The production is phenomenal, the message is profound.",1361318400,4,659,5.3173076923076925
8561127,5,B00B1VBF0Q,"This material is Awesome!  The Ultimate Encounter is unlike anything I have experienced on a screen before.  It actually takes me on a personal interior journey of transformation.  I return to the various sections again and again because I never come back to the material as the same person.  I recommend this video experience for anyone, age 14 to 114,  who is interested in connecting with depth yet doing so in a global, universal, contemporary, quantum scientific, 21st Century context.  We have used this material in a local Group Discussion forum and it is excellent for provoking substantive conversation.  I enthusiastically endorse this video art form.",1361232000,3,661,5.179245283018868
