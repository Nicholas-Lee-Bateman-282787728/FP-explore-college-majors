7950171,5,B00005QBZH,"This was the first film that was written just for L&H.
Ollie is an upstanding pillar of the community. But he is being paid a visit by his cousin Phillip (Stan) from Scotland. Stan is
a woman chasing, kilt wearing, scotsman on his first visit to america. He can`t figure out why he draws so much attention and
isn`t having any of Ollie`s attempts to put him into a pair of pants.",1263081600,,379,4.277777777777778
7950172,5,B00005QBZH,"This is one of the shorts most frequently cited as the first ""real"" L&H teaming, when they stopped being together in a film by more or less coincidence and began to be deliberately thrown together.  However, they haven't quite ironed out their screen characters yet, aren't wearing the outfits we're used to seeing them in, and most of all aren't really on the same team, even though they're a pair.  It's also one of my favorites of their silent shorts.

J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew Philip, whom he's never seen.  At first Ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he's behaving during his medical exam, but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow he's supposed to be greeting.  He has been told that Philip is a good boy, but he has one weakness--women.  Mumblethunder and Philip set off to go home, but their journey there is continually interrupted by Philip breaking into a little dance everytime he sees a woman, then chasing after the woman.  Huge crowds gather each time this happens, not so much because he's chasing skirts, but because Philip himself is also wearing a skirt (a kilt).  Finally Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailor's shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants, but Philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts.  There are lots of laughs all around.  It's also nice to see a short like this because the boys aren't exactly the characters we know and love.  Ollie is pretty much his usual character, but it's such a joy to see Stan acting so differently from his usual man-child character.  It shows he wasn't a one-trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when he got the chance.",1137801600,3,1822,4.589506172839506
