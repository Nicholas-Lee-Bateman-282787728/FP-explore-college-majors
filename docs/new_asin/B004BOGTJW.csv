8422113,5,B004BOGTJW,"One review stated that there was very little content on this disc and that it should be priced at $3. So I thought I would clarify a few things.

The main feature of The Bolt... is 7 minutes. However there are 20 plus minutes of bonus features related to this film including the film with an isolated musical score, early animations of the entire film, audio outakes by the cast featuring Bill Mumy, Angela Cartwright, Marta Kristen, Jonathan Harris and Tress MacNeille.

There are 3 additional animated comedy shorts on this DVD, about 11 more minutes of content. Two of these films, Chessmaster Theatre and Bloody Revenge were featured in the Spike and Mike Festival of animation a few years back. This is their first time on DVD.

The other bonus material consists of music videos for the band Anti-M.

This brings the total content time to just over an hour. Is it over priced? Perhaps a little. Should it be $3? If you have ever independently produced and released a film on DVD you know that you can't really sell a DVD for $3, it would be the same as giving them away. $2-$3 would be a good price for a Video On Demand of this project.

This DVD was  made available because people at film festivals were asking how they could get a copy. Making it available on DVD seemed to be the logical choice.

As the Director of this film I hope this use of the review space helps to clarify a few things.
Enjoy

I told everyone I knew about how amazing it was, but it wasn't until I got my own copy and had a private screening that they understood the true brilliance of this animated adventure. The animation is first-rate, and the acting? Well, even if you are unfamiliar with the original ""Lost in Space"" TV series, you will love hearing the narration of Johnathan Harris and the rest of the LiS cast. What I really appreciated about ""Bolt"" is how the rhyming stays true to the Seussian narrative, but has the added twist of being themed around mechanics. The men at my screening were laughing from the start, as the verses detailed all the names of different bolts and screws. If you are looking for a unique, hysterically funny gift, or if you want a real prize for your movie collection, this is the one to buy!",1296518400,,894,4.5246913580246915
8422115,5,B004BOGTJW,"I can just imagine Harris reading the script.  He would probably say something like: ""this is naughty . . . I like it!""

This video is a clever manipulation of the Christmas classic, Grinch.  In this scenario, we have fasteners, like bolts, nuts, and screws.  I guess it's a parody or some such thing.

The reason is works is because of the all-star cast.  Harris is amazing.  Then there is Bill Mumy.  Does anyone remember Babylon 5?  Yeah, that Bill Mumy.

A definite must-have for Jonathan Harris collectors.

Although this is animated, it's not really for kids.",1296000000,,565,4.721649484536083
8422116,2,B004BOGTJW,Very little content for the price. Main feature about 5 min long. It is only mildly entertaining. Should have cost about $3 not $15.99.,1295740800,,135,4.666666666666667
8422117,5,B004BOGTJW,"The final work of Jonathan Harris is a bittersweet remembrance of the consummate character actor, threaded onto a slightly naughty tale of Christmas. You can hear the joy and amusement as Jonathan growls and smirks his way through a retelling of the Grinch that delivers the nuts and bolts of this delightful short animated film.

An added bonus is the addition of a scene featuring Bill Mumy, Marta Kristen and Angela Cartwright, the first and only collaboration between Harris and his former Lost in Space costars. Tress MacNeille contributes her voice to the film as well.

This is a work of love both by John Warlaw and his team and the actors. Bawdy without being raunchy, fun without being forced, this is a DVD that should proudly sit on the shelf of fans of Lost in Space, animated short fans, Christmas film fans and of course, fans of that Chuck Jones cartoon that Wardlaw so gently and loving skewers.",1294704000,4,912,4.729559748427673
