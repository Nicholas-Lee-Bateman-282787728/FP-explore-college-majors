8428529,4,B004G8WS6Q,This comes across as a typical slasher film until you reach the twist at the end.  I didn't see it coming.,1459987200,,106,4.0476190476190474
8428530,3,B004G8WS6Q,Not the best producing of a motion picture movie film. I prefer horror films with creative murders and significantly more nudity.,1336780800,,129,5.190476190476191
8428531,1,B004G8WS6Q,"This movie is so bad that even grocery store rental kiosks are not carrying it let alone most every other conceivable distribution source. Usual markers of bad - low quality echo like sound quality; no subtitles; cheap foreboding same few piano notes to enhance whatever tension might occur except that that consists of a few Halloween store bought knife in the chest props. Settings consist of a couple of houses and some high school that was appropriate given the high school drama class level of acting. Highly improbable storyline of parents trying to kill off young son for the money. Parents try altering the wiring in the wall light switch which was dumb because it wouldn't do anything but throw the breaker -  bad science. Son finds bills stamped in large red letters that say overdue - they don't come that way. He also finds an insurance policy on him in font so large it must have written for someone with 20/200 vision. He then gives his parents a tablespoon each of powdered rat poison from which they immediately start frothing and die. Doesn't happen; at their masses with that amount it would take days with probably little long term effect.

Movie was good for testing the ff button on the remote.",1329523200,,1215,4.726415094339623
8428532,1,B004G8WS6Q,"I absolutely laughed outloud at one of the other reviews who went on and on about the ""direction, acting, blah, blah, blah"" about this movie. This movie--and I use that term VERY LOOSELY--has to be one of the worst ever made.  SIDE NOTE TO THE CASTING PERSON:  If you're going to do a movie ABOUT teenagers, at least try having some in your film.  Kinda' sad to see 30-something actors--and I use that term even MORE LOOSELY--playing teens.

Produced on a shoestring budget and written by someone who'd obviously been hit in the head numerous times with a brick, this thing was laughable at best.  Absolutely no cohesion to the ""plot"" and the editing...oh, the editing.  You get (1) scene of sky; (2) exterior of home (which looked fake); (3) scene of sky; (4) scene of trees; (5) scene of car driving through the trees; (6) exterior of home; get the picture?

Horribly acted, horribly directed, and possibly the worst editing ever imagined, ""The Absent"" needs to go missing from the stores ASAP.  The ONLY thing this had going for it was that it only last 80 minutes (of course that's 80 minutes of your life you'll never get back), most of which are spent looking at the exterior of a home.  This one defintely ranks in my top 10 of worst movies ever.  Avoid it like you would someone who has Ebola.",1313625600,2,1301,4.545064377682404
8428533,3,B004G8WS6Q,"I rented this from Amazon Instant Video. It seemed low-budget, and the beginning of the movie held some promise, then it just got increasingly confusing. I won't spoil any of it for anyone who wants to watch it but I was slightly disappointed in the plot. I give 3 stars because of some of the unexpected twists and turns, but it wasn't enough to make me happy I rented it. The editing could have been done better, too, as that added to my confusion.",1306627200,2,450,4.369047619047619
8428534,3,B004G8WS6Q,"Stars: Jennifer Blanc and Kelly B. Eviston.
This is a really good drama and then evolves into a very evil horror.
Makes twins seem justified,Then totally uncalled for actions to keep a secret.
To see the acting chops of ladies listed and Sam Ball as the sheriff was a joy,And even bigger surprise in what was assumed in Indy Horror.
Congrats to director Sage Bannick, You pulled off a good scare.",1297209600,,396,4.591549295774648
8428535,4,B004G8WS6Q,"Director/Producer/Co-writer, Sage Bannick had to battle studio heads in order to try and get this film made and I suppose after having to endure their lists of excuses for too long he decided to go ahead and make the film on a more limited budget. I am not an expect in the matter but I would think in some ways this turned out to be the better of the two options since this way I think he had a lot more artistic freedom to get the film made the way he visioned it rather than having some studio execs getting their dirty hands on the script and changing things around as they see fit. The film starts off with Vincent and Oscar as kids and Oscar being the target of a sinister plan to collect life insurance. Oscar does a little sneaking around and soon discovers what their parents are up to so he beats them to the punch and in return he spends 25 years in prison. We then jump forward to present day and we see what Vincent is doing and as well as finding out that Oscar is being released from prison. The film stays busy during it's short 80 minute run time, it manages to keep the slasher plot going strong while fitting in the back-story on Oscar and also the suspense on the missing teenagers as well as giving us enough character development so that we can have some sort of connection to these people. The Absent doesn't try and hide the identity of the killer, it also isn't much of a mystery as to what is going on. But it isn't intended to be any of those things either, the film gives you the story right from the start without hiding any facts but the story is gripping and interesting enough to keep you at the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next and ultimately wondering how it is going to end. The production values are good considering the budget, the settings, camera work, lighting and the soundtrack are all done very well and each plays a major part in the the over-all mood of the film. The cast is terrific as well, real-life twins, Denny and Bryan Kirkwood play the twin brothers in the film and both do a terrific job. The film seems to be a family affair since sisters Vanessa and Yvonne Zima star in the film as well. The entire cast has had experience in acting before so there was no reason to suspect the acting at all and having such a talented cast paid off. The Absent is a thriller that immediately grabs your attention from it's opening frames and keeps you glued to the screen till the exciting climax. I had a great time watching this and found it to be entertaining and one of those films you hate to see end so soon",1296518400,5,2572,4.261758691206544
