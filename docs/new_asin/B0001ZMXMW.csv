2049639,5,B0001ZMXMW,"Ok, here's the story. This. This is mother^%&#ing wishbone. He doesn't care about your rules. He doesn't care who you are. Wishbone is going to do what he wants, when he wants, wherever he wants and you can't stop him, got it? He's been fighting the power since 1995 and he's not stopping now. You want Robin Hood? He's got it. You want dogs dressed up in Robin Hood outfits with a bow that he can never actually use? Look no further. If you want to see a Jack Russell Terrier wrestling with serious moral issues and finding his identity in the end, then I have the story for you. It's Wishbone. And you can run and tell THAT.",1282521600,3,626,4.26890756302521
2049640,5,B0001ZMXMW,"This is the classic story of Robin Hood told wishbone style. Wishbone is a dog who sees himself as the main character in a good number of classic stories.  Stories such as: Frankenstein, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Three Musketeers, Oliver Twist and many others.  This show delighted and enlightened me as a kid.  What a great way to introduce kids to classic literature!  They just don't make shows like this anymore.  This is a show that both kids and parents can enjoy. I'm a fan, and I don't think I'll ever get tired of Wishbone.  I'm surprised that not many episodes have made it to DVD.  I would like to see more Wishbone episodes on DVD.  The only ones that I've seen so far are: Paw Prints of Thieves, Hot Diggity Dog and The Impawsible dream.  What about Homer Sweet Homer, Hercules Unleashed, Frankenbone (Frankenstein), Mixed Breeds (The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), Slobbery Hound, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, etc?  There are so many great episodes out there, and I know I'm not the only fan.  Hopefully we'll see more Wishbone DVDs in the future.",1273017600,5,1095,4.564102564102564

2049642,4,B0001ZMXMW,"I like the series for the Jack Russells' performances. This is one of the better ones, decent Robin Hood story, too.",1210723200,,116,4.571428571428571
2049643,5,B0001ZMXMW,"Paw Prints of Thieves is one of four Wishbone episodes released by HIT entertainment (as of December 2007). (The other three are: Hot Diggety Dawg, The Hunchdog of Notre Dame, and The Impawssible Dream.)

  Paw Prints of Thieves tells a watered-down story of The Adventures of Robin Hood, in which Wishbone plays the character of Robin Hood. For the parallel story in Oakwood, Joe is faced with the dilemma of helping Ellie (the lunch lady) take food to the food bank, even though it is against Mr. Bison's (the school food director's) policy.

  In short, the theme of the episode is - ""Is it ever right to break bad rules for a good cause, even if it means you might get in trouble?""",1197072000,5,685,4.528455284552845
2049644,4,B0001ZMXMW,This is a great video series for children who are also interested in reading or who would like to explore books suggested by Wishbone.  A fantastic gift also.,1173312000,3,158,4.642857142857143
2049645,5,B0001ZMXMW,"Wishbone is a jack russell who imagines himself as characters in different works of literature.  In this story, he imagines himself as Robin Hood.  This is a great series for children, because it  teaches them about literature.  It is also a great series for anyone who loves animals. This is one of my favorites, and I definitely think it's worth buying.",1169164800,4,355,4.770491803278689
2049676,5,B0001ZMXMW,I bought these for my grandson he loves them! He has a stuffed Aminal that was once my daughters and takes it everywhere with him so when I found the video he was so happy I wish they'd make the whole series on DVD.,1465344000,,215,3.909090909090909

The condition was new, reasonably priced and arrived in a timely manner. Would like to see more of this show on dvd. It's good for the whole family to watch.",1402444800,,301,4.033333333333333

2049720,4,B0001ZMXMW,"Wishbone...taking literary classics and turning them into stories involving a little dog.  A little dog who speaks proper English - uses good grammar - and actually gets the story (mostly) correct.  In contrast to other animated attempts, Wishbone as a series is applaudable.  Paw Prints of Thieves follows the example of Robin Hood telling the story - drifting in and out of current day and the story itself.  Wishbone is our central character though he does allow his human companions to take part on occasion.  The only annoyance?  Wishbone's young human friends may on occasion employ a whine or two that gets a little grating.  But never fear - the dog will take over again and teach us all a bit about literature.",1383868800,4,719,4.796747967479675
2049721,5,B0001ZMXMW,"I think Wishbone as a DVD complete collection could sell, eventually, but no company would fund that without testing the waters with smaller offerings first. The children who loved Wishbone had to grow up and have babes of their own turn into preschoolers before there would be a market. My daughter also read the Wishbone books, which we got at Target at the height of Wishbone popularity. She told me there is a social media group called ""No, I haven't read that classic yet, but I did see it on Wishbone."" Or something similar. Which is actually a joke, as most kids who loved Wishbone grew up to be VERY literate adults. This would also be a very sell-able series DVD if it is also created with at least Subtitles for Spanish, French, etc., which might be a time-intensive project. I was looking for Viva Wishbone!; I know where I can watch it for free, but wanted to own a copy, preferably bilingual.",1381276800,,905,4.558282208588957
2049722,5,B0001ZMXMW,"Love the wishbone series, this episode doesn't disappoint. Disc quality A+, sound quality A+. Only wish they put all of the episodes into one disc pack or something so I didn't have to piece-meal the whole series.",1372636800,2,213,4.783783783783784
2049723,5,B0001ZMXMW,"This dog is from my past.
I have very fond memories of sneaking up to my bedroom and watching this show on P.B.S.
I was not happy when they cancelled the show.
This show also refreshed my memory on history as this little dog would be dressed up in costume as the character he was portraying.
This show was a great way to unwind from a busy day.
Wishbone never disappoints.
I hope they bring all of these episodes to DVD.
