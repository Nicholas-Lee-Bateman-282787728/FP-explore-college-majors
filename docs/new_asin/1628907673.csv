8345443,5,1628907673,"I am pretty much a self-taught pianist.  When I saw this DVD available, I was hoping that it would help me understand some of the basics. I must say it has been very helpful, and has taken some of the mystery out of chords and the circle of fifths for me. Greg has a way of presenting the concepts clearly and simply.  Anytime I didn't quite understand a concept, it was easy to go back and view it again.  I am looking forward to the next DVD in the course.",1389744000,,458,4.066666666666666
8345444,5,1628907673,"I've been playing the piano for over 10 years with a very basic understanding of theory. My understanding of theory was basically that certain chords go with certain keys, but I really didn't why.
. All of the theory covered was easy to understand and practical. All the concepts that taught made sense and left no questions in my mind as how to apply them.
 I would highly recommend this course to any one, particularity someone who has always read notes but wants to improvise.
  I am very excited to FINALLY understand how music works and I'm looking forward to doing more of Greg's courses.",1389744000,,594,4.6380952380952385
8345445,5,1628907673,"I think learning theory is very fundamental and basic to improvising your music. Greg teaches the importance of theory, how we apply the theory and he teaches in a way that is easy to understand. He also gives check points for us to really absorb and practice on our own. Great teacher & great lesson!",1389657600,,301,4.490909090909091
