8371561,4,B002JPJ3Y8,"Benoit Lamy's La vie est belle(Life is rosy) is a rags-to-riches narrative. Featuring renowned Zairois musician, Papa Wemba, this movie, released in 2009 in DVD format, recounts the trajectory of the protagonist from his rural village to the land of dreams--Kinshasa. But Kinshasa is not only a land of hope for the socially underprivileged like Papa Wemba and ilk; it is also a hub characterized by vices: debauchery, matrimonial infidelity,occult practices and exploitation of man by man. A must watch movie!",1290470400,4,510,5.308641975308642
