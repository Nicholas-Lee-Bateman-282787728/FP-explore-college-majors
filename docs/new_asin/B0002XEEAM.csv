2134035,5,B0002XEEAM,Some of you may remember when Lock N'Load aired on HBO in 1997.  This standup hour is Denis Leary at his best. I've only waited 7 years for this!  I guarantee you won't be disappointed!,1104105600,6,185,4.257142857142857
2134036,5,B0002XEEAM,"This DVD has two of Denis Leary's comedy shows on it.  ""No cure for cancer"" and ""Locked and Loaded"".  They are hilarious!  There is no comedian that comes close to this.  Leary is the King of Angry comdey.  If you like standup comedy, and don't get offended easily.  Give this DVD a chance.  A good price for what you get, compared to buying the Cd's.  I don't like how people act like Denis ripped off Bill Hicks.  If anything he perfected Bill Hicks.  And hey Rogan touch this then holler back!  Untill then host Fear Factor and keep your gob shut!",1100736000,10,550,4.346534653465347
2134037,5,B0002XEEAM,"Denis Leary is angry. It's what he's best at. Being a cynical smart-ass with anger problems is his trademark. But it's funny as hell, to say the least. Along with Robin Williams, he maybe one of the most talented comedic actors currently working. Check out his emotional turn on the TV series on FX called ""Rescue Me,"" a dramedy about post-9/11 New York firefighters, which is easily one of the best shows on cable.

""The Complete Denis Leary"" is the first time ever his comic shows have ever been released on DVD (finally!). It includes his two shows; ""No Cure for Cancer"" and ""Lock N Load."" ""No Cure for Cancer"" premiered on Showtime in 1991 where Leary rants on profanely and bitterly about musicians (ones he praised and despised), meat, cigarettes, drugs, hypocritical animal rights activists, life etc. It's hard to choose on what's the funniest bit since they're all hilarious and oh-so-true. ""Lock N Load"" is also enjoyable. It was an HBO special during 1997 where he has an obvious good time wickedly poking fun at Michael Flatley, Marv Albert, fat people, the Irish etc. While not quite as amusing as ""Cancer"" but it's still a good laugh. The long stretch where he goes on about how much his kids drive him nuts was probably the funniest bit.

I really don't want to include any explicit desciptions on what he speaks of since it would really ruin your enjoyment on watching these. Just laugh and have a good time. But steer clear of Denis Leary if you're one of those uptight types who can't handle the truth and profanity because his humor is quite mean-spirited alot of the times. But if you're the total opposite of an uptight person, enjoy!",1100304000,74,1655,4.683848797250859
2134038,5,B0002XEEAM,"First off let me just say that Denis Leary is a genius. If you don't like the ""angry white male"" type of comedy, odds are you don't have much of a sense of humor and thus, this DVD isn't for you. Leary is shown at his best in this DVD. Leary also stars in the hit show ""Rescue Me"" on FX. The shows is about the firefighters of New York City and how they live after 9/11. The show is brilliant to say the least. So, in conclusion, if you have a sense of humor buy this DVD!!!",1100217600,5,474,3.8469387755102042
2134039,4,B0002XEEAM,"Denis Leary - the inherently controversial, chain-smoking, ultra-angry comedian turned actor - brings back two of his greatest shows / comedy albums to DVD.  This single-disc ""Limited Collector's Edition"" contains full-length versions of Leary's Showtime and HBO pay-per-view classics, ""No Cure for Cancer"" and ""Lock 'n Load.""  Sparing no one save his beloved wife, Leary skewers the American psyche and psychoses in these two performances.  The video quality is not perfect, and the extras aren't plentiful, but it's a good comedy CD for the price.

I have never been impressed with Denis Leary as a visual performer.  His acting skills have improved over the years, but the act of jumping around the stage wildly reminds me, of, well... Denis might call it the ""monkey on acid"" routine.  Of course, this may be a personal bias - I heard ""No Cure for Cancer"" as a CD album long before I ever saw the Showtime presentation.  The album proves itself to be much more sharply edited and concise.  Likewise, if you've heard ""Lock 'n Load"" before watching the HBO special, you might be surprised at how different the two are.

Yet there is still plenty to like about this DVD, although much of it comes from the rawness of Leary's delivery and not from any special features or behind-the-scenes footage.  With regards to ""No Cure for Cancer,"" I think the material is just as fresh as it was back in 1994, attacking the excesses of American life with impunity.  It also includes the most moving part of the show - deliberately cut from the CD album - in which Leary talks about growing up, his father, and a soliloquy about his prematurely born son that had some in the audience crying.  Then, without missing a beat, Leary jumps right back into the fray, sharp-witted and carefree as ever.  It's an extremely well-written moment, possibly the best one in the show.

""Lock 'n Load"", the other show included on the disc, relies more on flash and flair.  The comedy is admittedly less polished, owing to the larger effects budget.  Absent, thankfully, are the musical interludes that made the CD album pokey and, for me, nearly unbearable, although I admit I would have loved to see a video for ""Elvis and I"" or ""Life's Gonna Suck.""

Extras on the disc are sparse, consisting of interviews with Leary, Chris Phillips and Adam Roth, the writers of ""No Cure for Cancer"" and two music videos.  The only video really worth watching is ""A**hole,"" if only because the video version is more up-tempo and to see Leary's parody of ""Patton"" is well worth the effort.

For a Denis Leary fan, this disc is worth picking up - simply because both of these comedy shows are out-of-print otherwise.  I'm not overwhelmed by it, but I think you know what Denis would have to say about that.",1100217600,12,2764,4.7426778242677825

""No Cure for Cancer"" was the first time I saw Denis Leary.  I heard the A-Hole Song, and then laughed my head off at his comedy routine.  Not long after that I saw ""Lock n' Load"".

Denis Leary is very talented as a comedian.",1398643200,,301,3.95

2134075,5,B0002XEEAM,"His show No Cure For Cancer"" was aired on HBO and my boyfriend at the time and I taped it. When we broke up, I made sure I got the tape. But video is out, man: so I switched to DVD. But I didn't realize my copy was from Hungary or somewhere and not region one. So I decided to splurge and add a little more Denis into my life, before he went and got all sober and stopped smoking and singing ""somethinghole"" (because Amazon doesn't want me telling you about a donkey butt) at the top of his lungs (which, coincidentally, I still know all the words to, even his ranting diatribe at the end). When he was doing stand-up, I loved him as much as I love Eddie Izzard now - because he's bright, he's fluid, he's utterly fearless about the things he says, and he is usually in on the joke with you, and that maniacal grin lets you know HE knows you ""get it"". Denis went on to do some fantastic work as a writer/director/actor and win some awards and do a lot of charity work, and I know Stand-Up is one of the hardest things to do for a comedian, but I gotta say, the stage is a little less bright without his star flitting in with a lighter and a wheeze and a lung-full of cancer...and meat...and baby seals...and...",1371686400,2,1210,4.153191489361702

2134086,5,B0002XEEAM,"I thought this was hilarious when I first heard the CD back in the early 90's. Loved it so much I bought the VHS tape and loved that as well.

Fast forward 15 years: Just bought the DVD and still love it!

Listen, all comedians steal material... just a fact of life in the business. Very little original material now. The late 90's and early 2000's used up all the ""shock material"".

Same reason there are so many movie remakes. There's very little original material anymore. And for crying out loud, has anyone turned on the radio lately... there's nothing original there either. But you have to admit, some re-makes are better than the originals.

If you like Denis Leary's style, timing and delivery, then you'll love ""No Cure For Cancer""... great, raw performance!

If you want to stay loyal to the arts, and if you have the time, go ahead and listen to Bill Hicks instead... no need to get all pissy over it.",1255046400,,913,4.509090909090909

2134101,5,B0002XEEAM,Denis Leary gets right to the point.  This is not for the faint of heart or sensitive type.  His candor and cynicism is unmatched.  He gets right to the truth of the matter.  Loved it.,1167868800,,184,4.171428571428572

2134103,5,B0002XEEAM,"A blast from the past. From the first big years of Dennis Leary come his two Popular album/HBO specials to DVD.  This is what you've been waiting for if you are a leary fan. If you have the CD's, you miss out on all of his stage animation and antics.  Absolutely hilarious. And as a bonus, they throw in the video for ""*##hole"" as well as ""love cruise"".  This is Classic Leary, and you can relive the humor that made him great, but also truely apreciate how he has progressed as an actor/writer as his career has expanded. I also recommend The His Show ""Rescue ME"", now available on DVD. You see him as a great actor, and it's TV with a Leary humor twist. Kudos to this DVD and Leary.",1153785600,3,684,4.206106870229007
2134104,4,B0002XEEAM,"This DVD doesn't need a review: if you've seen Denis' shows Lock 'n' Load and No Cure For Cancer and loved them (like you should), you'll know you have to get this DVD. 140 minutes of raving Leary will get the adrenalin flowing, trust me. In fact, there ought to be some kind of health warning on the box to prevent overexposure. After all, we don't want people going round shouting ""Pull up your pants!"", and ""Gimme coffee-flavoured coffee!"", do we? Or do we?

I find only one fault with this DVD and that is that there are no subtitles. Granted, you'd have to be pretty deaf not to hear what he's saying; but some people are, and if you're a non-native speaker of English, you may have trouble too.

Good

# Fountains of Wayne writing Beatles songs

# American Office v the Original

2134122,4,B0002XEEAM,"I'll start by saying that if you're a fellow Leary fan, you'll like this package- his two most famous standup routines in their entirety on one disc, as well as some supplemental extras. If that's what you want, you won't be disappointed.

I however was, at least a little bit. The presentation is good- the concerts are in their entirety, uncensored, and look as good as when I first saw them on tv.

But here's one big problem- there's no chapter skip function. This is one of the most common features of any dvd, and to not have them on this set is just inexcusable. There's no way to skip to your favorite Leary monologues or rants (and there's lots to pick from, so that sucks), but possibly worse, if you accidentally hit the skip button halfway through the concert, it ends and you're stuck forwarding for five minutes until you get back to where you were. These concerts are around an hour in length each, so to not be able to skip to favorite spots is a real drag. Don't get me wrong, this should definitely be watched in its entirety- but once you have, you'll have spots that you want to see again. I love the vicious titular rant of Lock 'N Load, but it's at the very end of the show so I had to forward for minutes at a time to watch it again. That's just a pain.

The extras are pretty short too, without much more than what's advertised on the dvd package. It's okay- a music video here, a behind-the-scenes bit there, but there's not much substance or length to it. I'm not complaining, all of this stuff is nice to have, I just think the space could have been better used with, for example, his Comedy Channel roast, but that wouldn't have been contractually possible anyway.

In all, it's still worth getting for sure. Denis is a hilarious man who harbors a lot of unrestrained anger for much of the same stuff I dislike, so it's good to throw him on and laugh with him. And it's great to have his two main concerts on one dvd. I just wish that those helpful chapter skips would have been there, and as a fan I guess I was hoping for some more supplemental material. But great buy nonetheless for Leary fans.",1125705600,7,2126,4.347607052896725

Originally aired on Showtime, long time Leary fans know that this alone is worth the price of admission.  ""Lock 'N Load"" features Leary ranting about his kids driving him nuts, coffee, piercings, and poking fun at Marv Albert.  The extras included here are minimal: music videos for ""A**hole"" and ""Love Barge"", and ""The Making of No Cure For Cancer"".
