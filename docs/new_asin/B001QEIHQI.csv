3764555,3,B001QEIHQI,"My 4 year-old likes this about much as a PBS program and it does hold his attention for one or two viewings, Roland Martin stated that his kids look at this over and over all day. I would break the TV....lol. I thought this would be like hip-hop harry so that disappointing . This DVD is ok and does not live up to the hype, a few weeks ago I heard about this DVD on the Tom Joyner morning show, the promoter said that she created the collection because all of the children programming was annoying and bland.

The DVD's are not HIP HOP and the music never changes however, the children are cute. The pros are that the DVD is multi-cultural and its ""low-budget"" nature makes it appealing however it is basically like any children show it reminds me of a kind docu-kindergarten type of show. The duration of each DVD is about 23 minutes so; the price is high for what you get. I purchased the 3 pack bundle and title doesn't matter because each DVD basically cover the same type of material (count to 10, cover a few alphabets, some movement type activites,animals) so, there are some learning elements but, you will not create the next kindergarten wiz..... nothing replaces working with your child yourself.",1239753600,,1208,4.541284403669724

This has been my daughter favorite DVD for over a year now.  It was the first one she got up and participated in!  She loves it and so do I.  It's fun educations and NOT annoying, even after she has seen it a million time.  A Must Have for all kids.",1237248000,,457,6.306451612903226

8335417,5,B001QEIHQI,My 23 month old granddaughter loves it and wants it played over and over on a daily basis. Originally checked izt ouzt from the library but couldn't do it more then twice in a row.,1372550400,,180,4.171428571428572
8335418,5,B001QEIHQI,Purchased for my 2 year old grandson. He loved it. Never wants to turn it off once it is on.  Also brought as a gift for others.  All of the It's Hip Baby series DVDs are fun and educational.,1336867200,,191,3.871794871794872
8335419,5,B001QEIHQI,"Very good product, but for a much younger person than my child.  Service was very good and delivery was fast.",1246320000,,109,4.45
8335420,4,B001QEIHQI,"The video is cute.  My 4 yr old son doesn't love dancing/singing and i keep trying to find a video that will ""click.""...alas this one did not really either, but i'm pretty convinced now it is a personality thing, not a product thing.  it's pretty rudimentary video editing, but the songs are cute and have remained in our memory, so i consider it a success.",1246233600,,357,4.476923076923077
8335421,4,B001QEIHQI,"My son loves the music, although, I thought the videos would be longer than 30 minutes. I was also thinking there would be more songs on each video. It keeps my sons attention & he enjoys dancing around. I probably won't buy anymore of these videos.",1245888000,,249,4.434782608695652
8335422,5,B001QEIHQI,"My son, Gabriel, within the first 4-5 viewings memorized almost the entire show, including the songs.  This is from a child with moderate ASD who rarely speaks.  It was a joy to watch him sing the ""Bath Time"" song and ""Head and Shoulders, Knees and Toes"".  The program is a colorful array of children, characters and pacey music that keeps them all going.  The half hour rolls through quickly and Gabriel always loves to say good-bye, asking for Hip Hop Baby by name when he wants to see it again.  A really well-made product for kids!",1242086400,,535,4.53125
8335423,5,B001QEIHQI,This is one of my daughter's favorite DVDs. It's a perfect gift to encourage learning and being active. The music is great for dancing and singing! I highly recommend it to anyone with a toddler or with a toddler relative!,1240876800,,222,4.575
8335424,5,B001QEIHQI,"I popped this DVD into the DVD player while the boys were playing and they stopped when they heard the music. They both love to dance so my youngest started his cute little bounce dance while my oldest started his adorable sway dance.

Being that they are still very young, they really enjoy three things in educational DVDs (the only kind we let them watch):

1. Fun music
2. Kids being kids
3. Bright colors

This DVD had all three. It is recommended for children in the 2-6 age group but my two under two really enjoyed it. I think they will get a lot more out of it educationally when they are older, but it's fun for them to watch right now. Another big plus? I like it a lot. Some DVDs get really old really fast, but not ""It's Hip Hop, Baby!: Things We Do Everyday"".

My opinion is that this would be a fun DVD to give for a birthday present. My boys both smile when Hip Hip Simon comes on the screen and I love that that the DVD features everyday things like brushing their teeth, going to the park and going to bed. I also like that it gets them moving. I don't want them watching a DVD where they just sit there watching TV and getting no exercise. I love that ""It's Hip Hop, Baby!"" DVDs get my little ones up on their feet dancing, moving, listening to fun music and having a blast. I think this DVD would be a great supplement to the lessons I am already teaching my boys.",1240185600,2,1384,4.152985074626866
