3417258,5,B0018CWF0C,This is a great show. Its one of the best of the year. The only thing that bothers me is that its too short.,1221868800,,108,3.5416666666666665
3417259,5,B0018CWF0C,"Nick George is a lawyer. His father Dutch was also a lawyer and just died in a very suspicious plane crash.

Dutch had one very predominate client family-the Darlings.

Nick goes to the patriarch Tripp Darling to ask him what he knows about the  crash, but Tripp offers him a job as the family's lawyer and Nick takes it. He thinks this will lead him to find out more about the crash that killed his father.

What Nick finds out is more than he wants to know Tripp and his family.

Here are a few things Nick must handle during this first season
1. Tish Darling (Tripp's wife) had an affair with Dutch and one of the Darling kids is not Tripp's.
2. Congressman son Patrick is married and having an affair with a transgendered woman named Candy Cane.
3. Karen Darling is getting married to husband number 4 even though she is not divorced from husband 3. Immediately divorces Husband number 4 and gets involved with Simon Elder (who may have had something to do with Dutch's death)
4. ""Father"" Brian Darling has an illegitimate son (Brian Jr.) whose mother leaves him with Brian. He then lies to his wife and tells her that Brain Jr is really an orphan named Gustav from Europe who does not speak English
5. Twins Juliet and Jeremy, the youngest of the brood, are spoiled and have their own adventures with birthday parties, and Jeremy dating a former friend of Juliet whom she cant stand.

Who killed Dutch? Which Darling Child is not Tripp's? Watch Dirty, Sexy, Money",1221696000,6,1468,4.520754716981132
3417260,5,B0018CWF0C,"After watching the show from the beginning to the season end last year, I would recommend the DVD.  It is true that this show might not be for everyone, it is however entertaining. My husband doesn't like it, But I think that is a guy thing.",1221350400,4,241,4.239130434782608
3417261,5,B0018CWF0C,I have watched every episode but I don't remember a transgender character on this show like the previous viewer stated. If you watch or buy this series you won't be disappointed. It is very good.,1215648000,2,195,4.6
3417262,4,B0018CWF0C,"This is a surprising show.  Based on the title and subject matter, it may seem like a superficial love letter to the culture of the rich, the shallow and people famous for being famous, but it is so much more.  I haven't seen the 1st season DVD yet, so this review is based on the 1st season episodes aired on ABC.  Hopefully there will be DVD extras that add to the enjoyment of this set, though details haven't been provided yet.

In Dirty Sexy Money, the writers explore the meaning of extraordinary wealth and power, how those things can support an individual and give freedom, but also how they can distract people from their own true selves, their purpose and from what is really important.  What does it mean to grow up in an environment with limitless resources? To live in an environment where anything, or anyone, you want can be bought?  How does an individual in that environment find purpose or meaning in his/her life and relate to others? Is it a given that people in that situation will be corrupt or shallow?  Or do we, as the public, just expect them to be, and so they seem to live up (and down) to our expectations? And what if you or I had the opportunity to join them, would we?  And at what cost?

Those are the kinds of questions Dirty Sexy Money asks.  Along the way there is a fun, rollicking soap opera-ish ride, with scheming characters, luxurious sets, beautiful people, gorgeous New York City scenery (in the pilot anyway) and amazing, amazing acting.

Sure, in this first season, there are uneven moments as the show finds its tone and its footing, but the characters and the situations will draw you in and entertain you nonetheless.

If you want, come for the flash, the beautiful people/clothes and the humor (there will be plenty), but stay for the writing and the performances (pretty much everyone in the cast delivers, and there are moments with Donald Sutherland, Peter Krause, Jill Clayburgh,  Glenn Fitzgerald, Seth Gabel and others that are breathtaking) , and the commentary the series makes about how morality, balance, and humanity might even survive in our world, a world which often seems to only value superficial beauty, power and wealth.",1214956800,15,2187,4.693717277486911
3417263,4,B0018CWF0C,Don't let the title fool you. This is a really good show about a wealthy family and the lawyer looking for clues to his fathers death. It's kind of a newer modern version of Dyansty. Scandal with money. They even have a transgender character....not seen much on TV today. I look forward to the DVD and I hope some good extras.,1211155200,6,326,4.360655737704918

If the writing can't close a scene, make a transition, or set up the next scene, it isn't very good and/or it's for people who are paying such poor attention that they need outsized riffing guitars between scenes to feel like something is going on.

Too bad, writer Craig something-or-other did some good work on Six Feet Under but it seems ABC is less sympathetic to creative work.",1406073600,,466,4.682926829268292

3417284,5,B0018CWF0C,The product arrived safely and in relatively good shape. The content was what I had anticapated and the very reason it was ordered.

3417285,4,B0018CWF0C,"This series was fantastic! I am totally gutted that they decided to scrap it after only two, in my opinion brilliant series.

3417286,3,B0018CWF0C,"This show is about an insanely wealthy family and how they try and control everything and everyone around them with their money.  Sadly it probably has a lot of truth to it.  This family is so snotty, obnoxious and self centered that it's hard to connect with any of them.  The daughter of the show is Karen Darling and she is so shallow that a puddle of water has more depth than her.  Yet all these men fall head over heels for her...and not just for her money but they really ""love"" her...yeah right!  She is also anorexic (along with her old mother) and needs help immediately. Not one of the Darling children ever had anything intelligent to say EVER.  The only one that had any brains is Trip Darling, the father.  And you're never really sure if he is a bad guy or a good guy but I liked him anyways.

With all that being said it's easy to get wrapped up in the drama.  And there is a LOT of drama.  Just when you think you know where they are going with a story line it completely goes in the opposite direction.  They definitely keep you guessing!",1306886400,2,1056,4.256281407035176

3417289,5,B0018CWF0C,"Tastefully non-violent with clever weaving of the main plot, and starring an excellent cast, Dirty Sexy Money is a wonderful show.",1252281600,,130,5.238095238095238
3417290,3,B0018CWF0C,"Dirty Sexy Money (DSM) was a unique and eminently watchable show that fell victim to profit demands of its broadcast network (ABC), bad timing with the television writers' strike, and a fickle viewing audience.  Its combination of drama, satire, and comedy made for an excellent show that ended before its full potential could be realized.

I was initially excited when news of a DVD release manifested, but am ultimately disappointed with the result.  Both the list price ($39.99) and the current Amazon price ($27.99 at time of this writing) are far too high for 10 one-hour episodes.  DSM's producers and ABC should have waited to include the 2nd season's episodes in this set for the same price.  Given the 2nd season ended prematurely with only 9 full episodes aired and an unknown number (rumored to be 3-4) of completed episodes stored in the proverbial vaults, a great opportunity exists to upgrade this DVD set to include all episodes, including the unaired ones, in this set.  This approach would present 23-24 episodes, and more if the number of unaired episodes is more than the rumored 3-4, in one box set and essentially present a season's worth of episodes together, which is the usual number of episodes for a DVD box set.  If such a set were sold for the same price as this sparse 10-episode set, it would be a much more reasonable value for money and have the added value of rare unaired episodes.  Hopefully ABC and the DSM producers will consider this approach and perhaps give a discount to those viewers who already purchased this chintzy set and want to complete their collection of DSM.",1236729600,6,1610,4.807971014492754
3417291,5,B0018CWF0C,"This show was the best Prime-Time drama I have seen in a long time. There were a lot of character and thus a lot of story lines. This helped the show to have a little something for everyone. The show was well written and smartly so. The stories were engaging and at times edge of your seat dramatic.

Unfortunately after an amazing 2nd season was picking up steam, the show was cancelled. Supposedly there are episodes already filmed that may never see the light of day. It upsetting for faithful fans to find out that the loose ends will never be tied up with this one.

Proceed in buying this with caution, you will never know how it all ends up.

3417292,2,B0018CWF0C,"There are only 10 episodes, think they forgot to make the last 10 episodes that would complet the season- it leaves you with all the main story lines midflow, which is a shame as it seemed to eventually get going by the last few episodes. would give it 4 or 5 stars if it was a completed series, but half a series get half the score!",1232582400,3,333,4.0606060606060606
3417293,5,B0018CWF0C,"Each episode is short, and builds on what happened in the previous episodes, which keeps you coming back for more juicy developments.

3417294,5,B0018CWF0C,This is a really good show. It keeps things interesting. It kind of reminds me of hollywood celebs and how everything they do is public somehow and just the way they act with money. I highly recommend this DVD. The second season is even better!

3417295,5,B0018CWF0C,"A little bit on the goofy side as far as the story line, but the acting is great and the characters make the story believable.  If you love watching things that glorify the rich and famous, you will love this series.

The pilot episode is fantastic, and really sets up the season well.  By the end of season 1, you can hardly wait for the next one to come out.  I love the parallels between some of the characters and people in real life (a few will come to mind while you are watching).

3417296,3,B0018CWF0C,"It is a very good series until Juliet enters the picture.  Watching her was bothersome, her character closely resembling the shallowness of Paris Hilton. If you are over the age of 16, plain and simple, she is just irritating.  I fast forwarded her parts.  Nick, the family lawyer, was excellent just like he was in Six Feet Under.

The Darling family is completely whacked out, with oldest son Patrick cheating on his wife with a transgendered woman while running for Senate, middle son Brian as an extremely hostile priest, oldest daughter Karen being such a serial divorcee that her most recent marriage doesn't even survive the reception, and fraternal twins Jeremy and Juliet as aimless party boy and Paris Hilton knockoff respectively.  And their family lawyer Nick George has to ride herd on all of their craziness while trying to solve the murder of his father, who'd had the job before him, fend off Karen's perpetual advances on him, and try to keep his own marriage from imploding amid all the standard soap opera intrigue.

3417298,5,B0018CWF0C,"i kind of had to laugh at the reviews that are some how aghast at all the ""philandering"" that goes on...this isn't little house on the prairie! If you want moral fortitude, this is not the show to watch. I would have thought the title of the show...DirtySexyMoney...might have tipped one off to the fact that this family wasn't going to be an American ideal. They are a capitalist ideal certainly. The acting is brilliant, the characters are complex and likable despite their shortcomings. Peter Krause is SUPERB in his role as Nick George. Donald Sutherland plays the quintessential Patriarch with the evil side that is somehow endearing. This show is a wonderful social commentary as well on the super rich culture that reality tv can't seem to get enough of these days...Juliet (the youngest Darling along with twin brother Jeremy) is most certainly a charatature of Paris Hilton. She plays the role to perfection...and unlike Miss Hilton, she's lovable not annoying. This show is smart and funny and extremely engaging. It's one of the best shows on television. I am thrilled that this show survived the writers strike. Season two has proven to be just as engaging as season one...even though Juliet is off on a jaunt somewhere....(the actress Samaire Armstrong is rumored to be dealing with a recurring drug habit). If you haven't seen this show, I recommend it highly! As long as you aren't looking for this show to be a moral compass...it is a fun and fabulous romp. Enjoy!",1225929600,6,1480,4.853754940711463

3417300,3,B0018CWF0C,"Dirty Sexy Money is watchable but it's not riveting. Some scenes like the one where the Nick George character gets kissed by his ex and caught by his super sexy wife, are so telegraphed that it hinders the script. Even though you can pretty much guess the plot, there are worst ways to spend a weekend. Just make sure it's a rainy day weekend with a close friend.",1224115200,,363,4.352941176470588
3417301,5,B0018CWF0C,"Picked this up because of Peter Krause's work in Six Feet Under. This has a similar feel to it, although it's not as quirky as Six Feet Under. It's very much a study of the characters and their relationships with one another. It's a first season, so a good deal of the episodes are just introduction, and with such a sizeable cast, it takes a while. But you won't be bored because there's no lack of story. Plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing who's aligned with who, and what will happen next. If you like character driven drama, with a side order of murder mystery, this is for you.",1223769600,3,595,4.321428571428571

Unfortunatley, Season One was truncated by the writer's strike, but the show was well-established nonetheless, way more than I imagined back then.  I'm surprised by its popularity.  For example, it has been on the waiting list at Netlix for weeks after its release.  Wow, either Netlix didn't buy enough discs, or soooo many people wanna play.  I'm sure it's the exquisite portrayal of money, and the juxtaposition of the darling characters themselves.

Lust is one of my sins, so I never argue when it arouses me.  We are old friends.  Mostly, I love the way everything looks and feels on this show.

Traditionally speaking, life imitates art more often than art imitates life.  And, of course, masterpieces are imitations of life.  Dirty, Sexy, Money is an extraordinary imitation of life (pride, lust, envy, hate, greed, sloth, etc., etc.).

I don't care who you are, I am suspicious when you say you don't want to be rich, a concept way more than mere wealth.  Now, bring on the uninterrupted, full-tilt Second Season.

Only about $55 with sales tax.......works like a charm. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the 3-disc Season One of the series. I already have the second and final season (Region 1).

8269632,4,B0018CWF0C,"The story is intriguing.  The acting is very good with Peter Krause as Nick George who has been a family retainer for many years. His father's plane goes down in water off of NYC but his body is not in the plane.  Nick assumes that his father has been murdered but does not know by whom. The search for the truth in this is a major theme throughout.

It certainly lives up to its title.

Donald Sutherland cannot give a bad performance and is wonderful throughout and the late Jill Clayburg is wonderful in her role as Letitia Darling, the remainder of the clan are beautiful people whose very presence is evocative of luxury, irresponsibility and hubris due to the endless supply of money that is available to the family and the reliance that they have had on the wealth to fix things in normal and also in spiritual life.

A childhood love story between Nick George and Karen Darling weaves its way through the series and causes untold problems with Nick and his Wife that in some ways are inconceivable, yet can be understood to be circumstantial.

I do not know if the series was the beneficiary of the Writer's Strike or the victim of it; however, it would have been more interesting if it could have had at least a third or fourth season, but it does not disappoint with the luxury, prurient seeker of scandal and sex in such ways that it shows the very system that we know is corrupt is best used by those who hold these types of purse strings.

Although it is filled with intrigue, it also holds up some red herrings that are capable of leading even the best laid plans of this Borgia type modern family into areas that it finds more difficult but not impossible for the Donald Sutherland character Tripp Darling to unravel and turn to his advantage using only the lowest type of tricks left in the books but for the highest reasons.

All in all the story is engaging and will draw the viewer into the story with a set of magnificence, as well as truly flawed characters, each level of which have varying degrees of greed, control and pretense as their base for modus operandi.

I must say the cast is well chosen, extremely beautiful and truly seductive with the beauty of the characters and their weaknesses well presented as one would truly expect for such a degree of power, wealth and sexuality permissive and lascivious behavior---truly living up to its name as a series Dirty, Sexy, Money.",1483315200,,2404,4.546296296296297
