2816132,3,B000PC704W,"think of ten things in your mind that makes a movie great.  this movie would fail all of them.  that being said, there was something about it that i could not let go.  it might have been the amount of beer in my system at the time but the music helped me through it to the point where i started to care about the characters.
the reason i settled on 3 stars is the fact that this movie actually tried to be good.  you can tell there was effort but no money backing it.  for that it deserves the greatest bad movie i have seen in a long time title.",1222473600,,546,3.9272727272727272
2816133,2,B000PC704W,"When I saw this movie first listed, I thought that some one had misspelled ""Transformers"" for the title. But, it turned-out to be a separate film entirely. Being curious, I decided to invest the 86 minutes of my night off to watch it.

The movie begins by stating that humans had discovered life on a planet 200 million light years away and had sent a message of friendship. The aliens responded by sending an invasion force to Earth which killed-off 90% of humans in a short span of time. The remaining humans fled underground to live and the aliens left the humans alone, as long as humans didn't interfere with them. After hundreds of years, the humans finally embark on an effort to reconquer Earth from the aliens. After the initial attempt fails, a maverick human is enlisted for the second attempt. This human, Warren Mitchell, had been put in cryogenic freeze for an attempted mutiny five years previously, along with some of his followers. Mitchell then reassembles his old team of followers to embark on the new mission. Essentially, this new mission is make-or-break for the human race. If they win, the aliens will be defeated and Earth will be ours again.

Now, as far as the storyline goes, there is a lot borrowed from movies and TV series, especially Battlestar Galactica and Terminator, in the ""humans versus robots"" genre. Even Galactica 1980 seems to have inspired a bit in this film, in the form of flying motorcycles. Star Wars fans will also recognize a familiar name in the character named General Veers. I guess the writers decided to take a little inspiration here and a little inspiration there. The human survivors fighting a battle against the android army, which is led by a central tower is a vivid reminder of the Terminators being led by Skynet. Likewise, the entire scenery is dark with a ruined landscape, like the Terminator flashbacks showed in Terminator and Terminator Two. The difference is that the androids don't look like humans and the androids can assume two forms: the mobile biped form and a combat form where they actually transform themselves into a lethal weapon that launches missles. So, the androids can be ""more than meets the eye"", but not much more.

Special Effects in this movie were very basic and often look like they were created on somebody's home computer and, at times, reminded me of the graphics in some computer games. The weapons fire looked like something out of an old sci-fi movie from the 1960s. Humans even have fighter planes, although it is never explained how they were created and how the aliens even allowed the humans to develop them, especially the test flights that would have needed to be done for the aircraft. You'd think that an intelligent alien race would have shot those things down when they saw them or destroyed any location where they could have been launched from. So, the aliens can travel 200 million light years in 5 years time and conquer the Earth, but lack basic military tactics, aside from ""find human, kill human"" and launching themselves in wave attacks in mass. Okay, maybe I expect too much in this angle.

The quality of acting in this film varies from pretty good to pretty wooden. The characters of Mitchell and Itchy are the best acted, while the others are unconvincing. You don't feel the characters emotions projecting from the screen. All the characters wear black or other dark colors, which blends-in with the overall darkness of the entire planet. There are a few non-Caucasian characters in the film, but most of them are white. But, all the Caucasians are pale and lacking anything like a tan and this is good, since the Sun has been blotted-out for centuries by the aliens and it would be hard to explain a tan in such a place. There are no elderly people or children seen throughout the entire film, with the sole exception of the Chairman. Otherwise, everyone is in their twenties or thirties. All the female characters are hotties, to be sure, while the men range from rugged-looking to average. My favorite character is Itchy, who is Mitchell's buddy and former co-mutineer. I liked him because he seemed to be the most real of all the people in the film.

Action scenes, if they can be called that, look like something out of a drama class. You don't feel like a real fight is going-on at any time and there is no sense of anger or desperation projected by the people involved.

When I saw this movie, I did watch it all the way through. I will admit that much. If you are a fan of the old Flash Gordon serials, this movie comes pretty close in quality to the SFX and acting from those movies.

I was surprised at a little plot twist near the end, which I did not expect and it was only vaguely hinted at earlier in the movie. That twist plays a crucial role for the conclusion of the film and is the only reason I gave Transmorphers more than one star. I never laughed while watching Transmorphers and I was never on the edge of my seat. There are no sad scenes to make you cry. Nothing to make you care about any of the characters or even the whole human race, for that matter.

At best, it's a B-grade movie which does seem to borrow heavily from other, successful, films and the effects and acting are below what most of us would pay for to see in a movie, unless you like the low-grade stuff. At $3.99 to rent, I'd advise renting something else that won't make you grit your teeth in frustration at all the things wrong with this film and I sure wouldn't pay $14.99 to actually own it.",1200700800,22,5513,4.606924643584521
2816134,1,B000PC704W,"I picked this one up as many others no doubt have, after seeing the big budget 2007 ""Transformers"" movie. When you see a low budget film with reaching expectations and goals, you know that the film-makers will fall short. The film progressed as I had anticipated, with some cheesy special effects and  scenery chewing acting when the problems started. The dialogue was ""off"", making the movie seem dubbed even though it is in English and the background music was too loud to hear the depressed whisperings of the cast. I have found out that this was a problem with the DVD process, but it is a major issue. After the film ended I checked out the special features on the DVD, which include a ""Making of"" and a look at the effects-- not bad for a low budget movie. If you watch these, you will see the love that goes into making movies and altered what I thought of the production. I would have given this 2 stars, but the technical difficulties are too over-whelming.",1187827200,9,966,4.52

Machines take over the planet accept for one ""undisclosed"" settlement for humans.  The machines (TransFORMers) begin to close in on this location (terribly compared to Zion) and so they must engage (something like that of Starship Troopers).

2816137,1,B000PC704W,"Well that's time out of my life that I will never get back.

I work at movie-rental store, and that's the only reason I rented this.  If I would have seen it in the store as a costumer, I would have laughed, maybe read the back of the box, and then passed it... but while working I passed the box over and over again, getting more and more curious.  So finally one day I figure ""I work here and can rent this for free, why not?""  When in reality, someone should have paid me to watch this ""film"".

Some of the dialogue was ok, but it throws the audience into a plot they know nothing about, with horrible acting along the way.  I think I caught onto the plot, but it was just so poorly written that I couldn't keep the movie going (I was incapable of watching the whole thing).  The special effects were so poor that I think one could do better without even using a computer... the sound effects were pretty bad too.  To make it worse, whoever did sound for the movie didn't seem to listen to their mixing before production... sound effects often completely drowned out voices, voice-overs didn't match the actors' lips, and the volume level was no-where near consistent.

I feel horrible writing a review this bad... but I do it to hopefully save you.  Please, spare yourself from watching this movie.",1183939200,7,1302,4.410041841004184

I really cannot imagine any who would like to watch production like this. It is great that people have the motivation to do movies, but there is a thin line between bad movie and a complete trash. This was baaaaad, not even a B-movie, this fells somewhere between x and z.

Starring: Matthew Wolf,Shaley Scott and Sarah Hall.
A Leigh Scott film
Special Effects: Synapse FX
Without seeing that other big-budget robot film,This looks a lot like Starship troopers.
The costumes are great, So are the sets from T2(`nuff said) and the special effects just plain work, Ya'all!
 Matthew Wolf IS the movie, Embodies: Hero/and surprising character development.
 Shaley Scott is very cat-like and gets all the cute macho lines.
 Sarah Hall delivers a journeyman performance, That rivals her `Hitchiker` film role.
The menacing robots are stronger in depiction than Theasylum has shown it's monsters in the past, Seems given more time than can rival ANY effort that has a bigger budget.

2816142,4,B000PC704W,"A notable entry of the mockbuster era, Transmorphers - in league with War of the Worlds 1 and 2 - really helped solidify The Asylum in the cultural consciousness as an independent studio worth watching. Facing lawsuits - there were none - from Michael Bay and Hasbro, The Asylum brazenly forged ahead and released this dystopic sci-fi/action epic. It goes as follows:
After the discovery of life on a distant planet - 20 million miles distant, a nice nod to Ray Harryhausen, perhaps - we foolishly try and make contact. Decades we wait, and then the response? Full-on alien-robot invasion, one that obliterates 90% of the Earth's population and paves the way for the rest of the alien-robots to re-settle our planet. These robots? Transmorphers. It's up to what remains of humanity to act as our last defenders.
Cut to outer space, where a military guild ship has caught hints of a robot advance. The impending course of action causes a bit of a rift in the crew, half of whom side with the lady General (Eliza Swenson) and want to respond diplomatically, the other half on the side of another officer (Jeff Denton) who wants to respond with guns blazing. As a sort of compromise, or stalling tactic, a team of elite space-marine-type-folks are sent out to recover a bot for studying purposes. This is where the hunt begins, not so much on the marines' part as much as on the part of the warrior-alien-robots they presume to hunt. Excellent sound effects abound.
When they discover the coming battle is too big for just the team to handle, the military resorts to awaking a pair of problem-soldiers (Griff Furst and Matthew Wolf) from cryogenic stasis to lead the assault. Naturally, they're a little pissed about being frozen - Griff Furst for the physical act of being frozen, Wolf for the fact that in the interim, his ex-wife has become the new wife of...wait for it...the lady General! (wha-?)
This is the oft-spoken-of lesbian subplot mainstream media chose to latch onto in their mentions of the film, but honestly people, isn't that just lighting fires to watch them burn? I mean, aside from her body, Megan Fox looks like a unibrowed transsexual right out of the salon (no offense to transsexuals, or salons, only Megan Fox). Where's the brou-ha-ha in that thing making out with the Even Stevens kid?

I digress, but it doesn't matter, because from here on out the film becomes a cat-and-mouse game of intergalactic Risk, man versus robot for the supreme control of the others' right to live. The rest is yours to discover.
I will say, however, that overall Transmorphers was a nice sci-fi (that is, heavily technological) /post-apocalypse (that is, ruined landscape, decimated population, fight for survival) hybrid that plays like Starship Troopers set in a Warriors landscape. The sound editing wasn't so great on my copy, but the FX are amazing in design, if not comparably fluid in execution: at times the robots come off a little too 2-D, but for direct-to-DVD they are exceptional, and believable enough for your buck. The battle scenes are especially spectacular, enough so to make you overlook any technical short-comings if you allow yourself to get lost in the sheer artistry and resourcefulness of low-budget filmmaking.
As for performances, this one's peppered with a score of great ones from Asylum regulars. Jeff Denton (The Beast of Bray Road, The Hitchhiker), as mentioned, plays the stern officer itching for a fight, and as such he pulls off the HMFIC* role to a T, stoic and stern, the blue-collar translator to Eliza Swenson's more-polished authoritative general. The lovely Ms. Swenson (Dracula's Curse, Frankenstein Reborn) inhabits the role of the General as a cold, distant and emotionally detached administrator, in short the perfect commander. Visually Ms. Swenson comes off as a young Angelina Jolie meets Amanda Seyfried, which is a beautiful, beautiful thing. But her most powerful asset is her ability, for someone so petite, to fill the screen with her strength, an insane amount, like the button that unleashes the bomb. No wonder she's been employed by The Asylum seven times (catch her next in director Leigh Scott's The Witches of Oz).

Unfrozen soldiers Griff Furst (Alien Abduction, The Hitchhiker) and Matthew Wolf (The Apocalypse, Dragon) are a gruff but wry duo, a blend of humor and action. Furst comes across as the space-Maverick to Wolf's Goose, but in the former's case, even badder-boy, grizzled and dashing, a charming machine of a soldier. He's never been more likable, or formidable.

Other notable performances in this large ensemble cast come from Asylum regulars Shaley Scott (The Hitchhiker, Invasion of the Pod People) - who as a firestarter is deliciously meddlesome, insidious and mayhemic in a Serpent-queen kind of way, if that makes any sense, which it totally does to me; she's got blue eyes that'll burn right through the screen - Michael Tower (30,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Dracula's Curse), Sarah Hall (When a Killer Calls, The Hitchhiker), Erin Sullivan (Monster), Noel Thurman (Supercroc, Universal Soldiers), Jason S. Gray (Universal Soldiers, The Da Vinci Treasure), Jessica Bork (Dragon, The Hitchhiker), Thomas Downey (The Beast of Bray Road, King of the Lost World), Monique La Barr (Death Racers, 666: The Beast) and even a few more.

Of course, this giant cast is brought to you by none other than Leigh Scott, who comes across as very loyal for how often he uses the same folk. Mr. Scott wrote and directed this film in ambitious fashion, complete with split-screen and a grayed color-scheme that played together to form a claustrophobic, prison-like future from which there is no escape but full-blown revolution.

Though alike in name and concept, the story of Transmorphers is its own, independent of the Hollywood version, and, in that regard, is a successful futuristic-actioner. It's arguable that Leigh Scott mastered the mockbuster, and I think the best proof is right here.",1298851200,,5966,5.01008064516129
2816143,1,B000PC704W,"By the way I already own a copy of Transformers-Revenge of the Fallen which I must admit was inserted in my DVD Player after trying to watch about 30 minutes of Transmorphers. Transmorphers is absolute trash, translated very poorly into English. Way, way too much drama and not enough action when compared to Transformers. It was available for 32 on Amazon in used condition.

Out of all of the movies that I have seen in my 47 (almost 48) years on this planet, this movie is in the class of some school kids wanting to make a movie, and then getting some friends to hook up with them and create some extremely sorry, and extremely low budget, props!

The aliens are robotic and can transform; that adds a third unrelated-but-famous movie to the mix.  The movie is not that bad, really.  It crams a lot of characters and scenes into 85 minutes.

Why only two stars?  Firstly, the audio and video tracks are out-of-sync for half of the DVD.  The movie looks as if it has been redubbed in English.  Secondly, the special effects and audio postproduction did not get finished.  Much of the movie has some muted soundtrack or inappropriate music, poorly-cropped video shots without special effects, an uncompleted feel.  The sight of people shooting laser guns without the movie laser sounds or effects.  Thirdly, some of the movie just doesn't make sense.  Of course, this doesn't really matter and is some of the fun.

2816148,1,B000PC704W,"I thought I'd seen the worst of them but this movie redefined the floor. How bad can it be... I mean, it's sci-fi and it has robots, right? Sort-of. It seems like two-thirds of the movie goes by before seeing much of the robots. Even then, we only see them in short clips. It would be bad enough to say they looked like toys or models. What's worse is that they look like models that were just pulled out of the box and never got painted or stickers. As far as robots go, you would be better off just watching TV and hoping a robot shows up in the commercials.

Ok, so the robots don't really live up, but the movie's probably at least mediocre, otherwise, right? Not even. The Sci-Fi channel has never even run a movie this bad.

Bad enough to be fun, camp, or at least fun to make fun of? Not really. The dialog isn't just bad but stiff and repetitive. Between the quips of daytime soap opera dialog, I think I heard the words, ""Copy that,"" as an acknowledgment twenty or so times.

The script is a patchwork of cliches borrowed from other sci-fi plots. But, oh, the delivery. Remember all the bad full motion video on early 90s PC games? It's worse than that.

I found a single moment of joy in the film as I watched a female pilot sway left and right with a flight control joystick. I kept thinking about how unnatural that looked. Eventually, I started thinking of where I had seen better physical reactions. Star Trek. Yes, even William Shatner's overacting ridiculous take on the Enterprise attacks looked good... even realistic... compared to this... and THAT was funny.

This movie is impressive in one way. In nearly every B-movie, some small aspect of the movie remains decent or even good - whether it's editing, camera work, sound... something.

The Asylum is one of my favorite production companies out there although from what I have reviewed you would think other wise. But their original work and most of their rip offs are usually good on an independent B kinda level. Recently I and my brother had a marathon of nothing but their movies; this was one of the ones towards the end. I have to say that the cover looked kinda cool and it gave me hope after watching some not to great ones. Thankfully it was actually decent and really should have been renamed since it really is more like ""Battlestar Galactica"" then ""Transformers"". But since that film was coming out I guess they went with that. Still this was a good enough movie.

The story is your basic humans vs the killer robots ala Galactica, Terminator and so forth but even as over used as that is it manages to be a good movie. It seems that at one point or another the robots came down as a separate alien life form or something and took over the world. Since then the humans have been hiding away with a select few that are trying to mount a turn around in the war. So the film follows this group of military people and their time fighting the robots and themselves in the process. As messed up as all that sounds this manages to actually be an entertaining movie.

Producers David Rimawi and David Michael Latt should have really renamed this movie because it may have been one of those situations were the film actually seems better under a different name. Still in a line of not so great movies this one is actually worth more than one viewing. Writer/director Leigh Scott has scored once again seeing that I have enjoyed his other works I have seen. His script while not the most original thing is still very interesting and seems like it could have been an official spin off of one of the things mentioned earlier. His direction seems to have been good and kept the pace moving at a good pace, and some of his characters were actually really good.

The actors in this film range from good to not so much but all seemed like they were there to make a good film. There was one girl in particular that was really good in this movie, I can't remember her name but she played the bad girl type that didn't like the lead girl or something like that. And as far as special effects go you can't expect much from the budget but for what it is they are good. The movie is actually shot very well and any fan of ""Battlestar Galactica"" will recognize the style used in this film, very much a rip off to say the least. Still this film is pretty good for this company and is worth a rental if you have nothing else better to get.

If you have never seen anything from this company this is a good one but there are much better films from them to start with. I say give this one a try if you are a fan of the show I mentioned it may be a cool little flick to check out if you like that style of entertainment. So sit back relax and enjoy a pretty good rip off of those shows and films that you will see all through out this.",1237593600,,3047,4.246551724137931
2816151,1,B000PC704W,"I'm actually somewhat of a fan of these Asylum knockoff type movies, and find some of them entertaining and a lot of fun.  Not this one however.  Good grief.

Alien robots conquer earth - you won't actually see this, just some meteors hitting a city and then one really awful CGI robot appears and strikes a pose.  At some point in the future, the few remaining humans decide to fight back.  First, they send out a small team with a metal disk, which they place on the ground.  If a robot comes within 6 feet of this thing, it will immobilize it.  I mean, robots have control of the entire earth's surface, what are the chances of one of them getting within 6 feet of this thing?  Anyhow, it doesn't work, the human's weapons are completely ineffective against the robots, they all get wiped out.  One of the robots transforms into a huge cannon, then fires a comically wimpy little CGI effect at them.

So, what to do now?  Well, since they're all completely incompetent, they decide to thaw out a prison inmate who is serving his sentence in cryogenic suspension.  Yup.  The few remaining humans are wasting their resources on keeping prisoners cryogenically frozen.  What are the chances there will even be any people left by the time their sentence is completed?  Whatever.  Having this guy lead the rebellion causes a lot of arguing on the part of everyone else.  A good way to kill some time in the movie.  At one point he's having an indoctrination session for some of his macho soldiers, and three girls walk in and start talking in quasi-poetry like they're members of a high school Dungeons and Dragons club.  A lot of the dialog is like this - ludicrous.  I was too distracted by the fact that the audio and video are out of synch on the DVD to notice.  someone starts talking, and a moment later their lips start moving.  It's positively comical when you've got several people in a scene, and you hear words being spoken, and then after a bit you find out who's actually speaking them when one of the characters starts moving their lips.

They eventually go out and combat the robots some more, now their weapons are very effective against them (did I mention they had no effect at all before?).  This stuff is pretty much incomprehensible.  It's edited so badly that important scenes last only a few seconds so it's easy to miss that they even took place.  One of the funniest parts is the sounds that the guns make - or should I say, don't make.  In about one-third of the scenes, you get a comical looking muzzle flash special effect, and some goofy ray gun sound.  But about two-thirds of the time, it's just somebody holding up a plastic gun, pretending to feel a recoil, while we hear and see nothing.  You can't help but laugh.

The movie descends even deeper into incomprehensibility and by the end, it isn't even trying to make any sense.  Two robots are shooting at some guys, one guy takes off his earring and tosses it into the room with the robots.  He says some stuff that makes no sense whatsoever, then in the next scene the robots are forgotten about.

Overall, this is just about the worst movie I've seen in quite a while.",1235001600,3,3153,4.514134275618375

8190463,5,B000PC704W,"You'd think that this ""rip-off"" would be so terrible. But I think, compared to other movies of it's time, it's a great action flick. They take the concept and run with it, and don't try to go beyond their bounds.

I won't go into specifics, because of spoilers, but it's a great movie. The twist at the end makes it worth the wait.

Check it out!",1367539200,3,346,4.2272727272727275
8190464,4,B000PC704W,"In 2009, a race of aliens piloting giant robots conquer Earth and force humanity underground. 300 years later, after many generations of living underground, a small group of human rebels plan to finally take back their world from the mechanical invaders. Thing is, they learn that aliens do not pilot these monstrosities but are, actually, the giant robots themselves.

Directed by Leigh Scott(Dragon, HG Wells' War of the Worlds, The Witches of OZ), it stars Matthew Wolf, Amy Webber, Eliza Swenson, Griff Furst, & Michael Tower. Transmorphers isn't bad at all. I figured that it'd be like the Transformers movie, storywise, like so many claimed this movie to be a knockoff of..turns out, it was even better--in my honest opinion. I'll admit, you can tell it was made on a modest budget but it's got alot of heart.

I'll say it again, as I do in most of my other reviews of movies from The Asylum, I really wish people would quit giving this company so much flack about their films. So what if they're knockoffs(mockbusters) of major motion pictures, I don't care, really. I just want to be entertained with a good movie and, if it entertains, I'm happy. The Asylum puts out some pretty entertaining ones. I'm sure they'll admit, as will I, that not every movie is a winner but moviemaking is a hit-or-miss business, anyways. So come on, people, quit complaining and give this company a break. There's other companies that do the same exact thing they do. 'Nuff said.

Give Transmorphers a looksee.",1346976000,,1499,4.8023255813953485
8190465,5,B000PC704W,"THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I will recomend this movie to all of my friends for years to come.  Whenever I have a girl over at my house, I'm going to pop this baby in the VCR, rewind it back to the beginning, and impress her with my knowledge of everything that has to do with robots.  The graphics were great!  But the most impressive things of all were the small unit tactics and advanced military technology employed by this film.  The only downside that I can see, is that the cost of the laser guns alone must have been in the billions.  So I doubt that this film is going to break even.  That means that we may never get films like this one again, since the studios will most certainly be loath to spend that much money.  That makes this film a national treasure.  Thank you Leigh Scott, once again, you have outdone yourself, and you have cemented your reputation with this film.",1339977600,2,940,4.482352941176471
8190466,1,B000PC704W,"Okay...if you're looking for a train wreck of a film...this is it.  I mean...I love it...but...it needs to be rated a 0.  The audio is out of sync after a bit and doesn't sync up until about 20 min left of the movie.  At the start of the film they have plastic laser guns that make sounds light up and shoot a light.  A bit later the tips of the guns have a light bulb that lights up and there's a sound.  Winding down the light bulbs must have burnt out because all you had was a sound while they stood there holding the guns.  Finally when they ran out of sound effect budget they were just standing there shaking the guns...I'm not making this up...

Seriously I do recommend this movie...after seeing this EVERY OTHER MOVIE will look like it should win an Academy Award.",1335916800,,774,4.260273972602739
8190467,4,B000PC704W,"If you are looking for a great, cinematic blockbuster like Transformers, you are in the wrong place.  If you are looking for a movie that is so cheesy and bad that it is absolutely hilarious, you have found it.  Graphics and acting are definitely low grade material, but that all adds to the good laugh.  Of course this was not intended to be a comedy.

Also, though the hero is a man, there are more tough military women in the cast then men.  Again, non of these women will be receiving an Oscar anytime soon, but I like strong female roles, and I enjoyed their roles in the movie (of course that is from a male perspective, so take that with a grain of salt. Don't know if I can get my wife to watch this for her feedback).

P.S. I would have given it 5 stars, but I've seen a few movies that are more hilariously horrible.",1331078400,,826,4.19620253164557
