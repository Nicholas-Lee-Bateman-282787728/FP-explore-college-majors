7922086,5,B00004SU0K,"""Rice & Potatoes"" is a unique, charming, warm-hearted, edutational as well as educational film which works beautifully on multiple levels.  First, directors John Biasatti and Todd Wilson gathered an astonishing array of eclectic, intriguing, sympathetic and insightful gay Caucasian and Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Thai, Persian, you name them - they're all here) males, many in long-term relationships, partnerships (""marriages"") with each other (i.e., Asian Male + Caucasian Male), and the two directors began interviewing these men on every conceivable topic - from ""First Attraction"" to ""Turn Ons,"" from ""Body Hair"" to ""Stereotypes"" (such as ""rice queen,"" ""potato queen,"" ""mashed potatoes,"" ""sticky rice,"" you get the idea), from ""Age"" to ""Family.""  It's an utterly fascinating, professionally orchestrated hour suitable for gay and straight spectators unequivocally.

Second, it should be noted that ""R&P"" will have its most direct appeal to Caucasian and Asian gay men and the people who love them.  But the documentary goes much deeper than that.  ""Rice & Potatoes"" is, at its root, a cross-cultural examination, a ""Sociology 101"" short-course if you will, concerning inter-racial, congenial and amicable relationships generally.  Viewers may find it astonishing to understand that, as recently as 1967, inter-racial marriages between HETEROSEXUAL persons was not only considered verboten, but constitutionally ILLEGAL besides.  The landmark case of ""Loving v. Virginia"" (1967) overturned this illegality, to the delight of inter-racial straight couples across America; soon they were getting married left and right, under the auspices of the U.S. constitution.

The time was right for them, and the Supreme Court understood this. Yet now, and particularly with the legalization of gay marriages in Massachusetts, we are faced with the next great struggle which, if not directly addressed by Biasatti and Wilson, is implicitly portrayed in their winsome documentary here.  Let's face it, America.  That Thai-Caucasian gay couple are our next-door neighbors.  They're normal people who want to be treated normally, with the same rights and legal perquisites as all heterosexual married couples may tend to take for granted.  What we come to realize by the end of this 58-minute exploration of inter-racial human dynamics is simply that, the United States once again must rise to the challenge of tolerance and acceptance, the right to pursuit of happiness including its vast homosexual community (whether inter-racial or otherwise), and change its collective attitude accordingly.  Either that, or continue de facto to be guilty of self-ascribed bigotry.

Most importantly though, Biasatti and Wilson have literally ""blasted open the door"" for future documentarians chronicling the delight and plight of gay couples, whether inter-racial or intra-racial.  One can easily imagine the next serious documentary covering Caucasian females and the Hispanic women who love them, or interviews of Russian men and the Caucasian men who adore them.  The possibilities for ""the next great, probing documentary"" are now virtually endless, thanks to these two brave, honest, sincere and intelligent film makers.

""Rice & Potatoes"" is a bit reminiscent of that equally-award-winning and seminal documentary ""Sex Is,"" only the NICHE aspect of ""R&P"" is what makes this artpiece truly ""sui generis,"" one-of-a-kind.  And a must-see.  Please DO see it, buy it, or borrow it from a friend if you can.  I promise you won't be disappointed.

My strict and only regret and ""negative"" critique as of this writing simply is that ""Rice & Potatoes"" is not yet available in DVD format.  To my knowledge, it is STILL only purchasable as a VHS tape.  Why!?!  As most of us are only-too-well aware, tape is increasingly pass.  This is definitely a crippling drawback for this nonfiction work of high art, unfortunate and disadvantageous to audiences everywhere because, if ""R&P"" could be marketed in a sleek, ""Collector's Edition"" DVD package for example, complete with liner notes and interviews with cast and directors (think ""Criterion Collection""), assuredly it would be picked up by thousands of new documentary enthusiasts, enjoyed immensely and become part of vast numbers of burgeoning digital libraries.  At the very least, let's see ""Rice & Potatoes"" available on DVD, in ANY edition.  As it lingers currently however, hamstrung by its exclusive VHS format , ""R&P"" remains pitiably on the margins of potential new viewership.  Note to Producers:  Get ""Rice & Potatoes"" out on DVD - A.S.A.P.  The dividends in terms of thousands, perhaps millions of new highly-intelligent, digerati audience members, will certainly outweigh digital-conversion production costs.  And that's a rice-and-potatoes feast, fit for a king AND queen.",1152316800,,4819,5.551299589603283
7922087,4,B00004SU0K,"Well constructed documentary on the relationships between Asian and Caucasian men.
Those interviewed showed insight and intelligence with the topic.

Stereotypes are debated, questions are offered up as to why prejudices exist, and conclusions are drawn.

An interesting breakdown of the three types of men who are attracted to Asian men, is given.
*just plain PHYSICAL attraction

*PHYSICAL attraction and the those who know a bit about the culture

*those who want to BE Asian!",1103673600,2,479,5.346666666666667
7922088,4,B00004SU0K,"I first saw this charming documentary film at a gay film festival in LA several years ago, and I'm so thrilled to see it finally come to video.  Being Caucasion myself with an Asian partner of almost two years, the film is especially interesting and meaningful.  True, the film does not contain earth-shattering, groundbreaking information, but it is of particular interest to mixed-race couples who would enjoy hearing the experiences of other couples like themselves.",983836800,8,469,5.24
