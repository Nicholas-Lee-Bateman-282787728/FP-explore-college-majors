812464,3,6304239181,"This movie was recommended to me by a relative. It was well written I admit & also well filmed.  However, it had its ""letdowns""  (e.g. I think it was quite obvious that Jodie was faking her unhappiness  about her Grandma's coma & her teacher's death).
The ending, in my  opinion, was quite poor. They could've extended the movie & done  something more interesting, like put Jodie on trial.
It really didn't  deserve the R rating. The violence was actually quite mild and infrequent,  and in my books, only earned a PG13 rating.
Not the best thriller/drama  ever, but does deserve more credit than its been getting (Especially for  Gabrielle Boni, who was very good as 10-year-old sociopath Jody).",965001600,3,696,4.830508474576271

812989,4,6304239181,"Jody, a 10-year-old orphan girl with lovely red hair has bonded with her adoptive father, an unemployed toy designer who loves Jody dearly.  But for some reason everyone else keeps finding fault with the poor little girl, starting with her school principal who judges Jody to be an incorrigible trouble maker.  Jody tries to be good, and even goes to the principal's office to ask for extra credit assignments, but the old woman just shows her a thick folder containing reports of all Jody's misdeeds, and tells the little girl that she is going to call her adoptive parents and recommend that Jody be sent to a boarding school for children with special needs.  Faced with the prospect of losing a father for the third time, Jody ingeniously manages to murder the old lady and make it look like an accident.  She then takes the incriminating folder and gets away without being seen.  Next up, Grandma, who is always trying to convince Jody's adoptive mother to get a divorce.  Another old bat trying to destroy the little orphan's new family!  Jody cleverly nullifies that threat by pushing Grandma down a flight of stairs, then remarking, laconically, ""most accidents happen in the home."" Another proponent of divorce is the nosey next door neighbor.  A skillfully applied fireplace poker silences that potential home wrecker. But poor Jody, every time she eliminates an obstacle,  a new one looms up in its place. Here's a little girl who shows intelligence, imagination, initiative, ingenuity, perseverance and a wry sense of humor, but her only reward is... Well I don't want to give away the ending.  Let's just say it's tough to be a little kid nowadays.",1461801600,9,1660,4.875444839857651

Jody is so apprehensive of losing these parents that she will do anything to keep them.

813541,2,6304239181,"You already know with a cast consisting of William Katt (the Greatest American Zero) and Michelle Green (queen of mediocre, obscure TV flicks) that this isn't going to be a wonderful picture.  Add a little red-headed monster with creepy dark eyes and an irritating voice (Gabrielle Boni), and you get a campy circus on an outlandish scale.  This movie wants to be The Bad Seed, not unlike other films like The Good Son, Bloody Birthday, etc., but this particular one tries so hard to be like it that it's very nearly painful to get through.

Lacking the twisted charm and terror of Patty McCormack, Gabrielle Boni's presence on the screen as Jody is so irritating you just want to smack her a bunch of times.  All you see are freckles, angry black eyes, and hair that rivals Ronald McDonald's.  I assume the anger is real; Boni was probably furious that her parents signed her up for this recycled concept that's been done 500 times before and tons better.

Little Jody (Boni) is so obsessed with keeping her family together and staying close to her adopted daddy (Katt), a loafing toy maker who over-indulges her bratty behavior while thinking nothing of letting his wife (Green) work hellish hourse to pay the bills, that she cuts off any threat of being taken away from him in the form of murder.  She pushes a teacher off a chair and pushes a book case on her (awfully strong for an eleven year old), beats her mother's divorce attorney friend to death with a fireplace poker, smacks a social worker to death with a hammer, and pushes grandma down the steps after a failed attemp to poison her prune juice.  What I want to know is how any kid that age knows enough to squeeze an oxygen tube shut in the hospital to finally kill a grandma that refuses to die off in the first place.  I also want to know why nobody suspects this kid of all these murders given her history of trouble making except for her cousin Karen.  It's obvious by the things she says that she is fully capable of the crimes.

Well, if you like bad acting, an implausible script, and stupid dialog, this movie is for you.  It's not boring, but it's nothing you haven't seen before, and almost any other movie on this theme is better--except for Bloody Birthday, which is definitely worse.

813543,1,6304239181,"Gabrielle Boni plays Jodi, a female version of the Problem Child, except everything she does as an 11-year old actor is irritating instead of funny.  Adopted by a rich family, she does her best to shrug off the fact that she's the proverbial red-headed stepchild, a ginger train wreck dressed in strawberry hues to accentuate her nausea inducing appearance and acting.  With a connect-the-dots complexion and a head of hair that made me think she could be Joe Dirt's cousin, Jodi insists throughout to her step-parents that she can improve her behavior.  That she can do better.  Her acting suggests improvement is impossible.  At one point the ginger abomination - incidentally, she's currently in her mid-twenties and very pretty - does something heinous and immediately thereafter says, ""Most accidents really do happen at home.""  Incorrect.  The casting couch is where accidents happen, because the rest of the cast is only moderately better than the professional thespians in Air Bud.

As for the plot, it's incredibly simple and predictable.  Little orphan Annie has daddy issues due to a ""mysterious"" past, and those who get between her and her current daddy are in danger.  Granny goes stair surfing.  Social worker gets tenderized.  Cast-members look quizzically at little Jodi, partly because of actions and partly because of her stupid lines.  Mostly, however, because she looks like the love child of Carrot Top and the Wendy's girl.

Will little Jodi get away with her evil actions, or will she be caught RED handed?  It's probably not worth watching for you to find out.

813544,4,6304239181,"First off I have to say it took me awhile to find this movie but luckily I discovered Amazon! Yes it may not be that special of a movie to some people, but to me it's simply a guilty pleasure! I tend to own alot of guilty pleasure films in my movie collection. I do enjoy this treasure quit some bit, it always gets my skin crawling! The film has a 'Good Son' and 'Bad Seed' feel to it just switched to the obsession of a father. The premise it simple- A young girl named Jodi gets adopted by a wealthy couple and then becomes obsesses with her foster father and kills to remain his only precious gem. This red headed girl who plays Jodi is truly chilling in her portrayal of a child loosing her mind. I loved it! The first time I had ever seen this movie it when it use to play on showtime and I had caught the last half hour of it, and ever since have been in desperate search for a long while till now. I bought my own copy right here on Amazon and was thrilled with it!! The acting and setting and camera work is very well done with the feel of a Lifetime movie but that never stopped me, and nor should it stop you! There are also some familiar actor/actresses in here you may know from other films such as the father a possibly the mother. I just love the grouchy old grandma in this movie, she sure gets it good when Jodi decides she wants to play a little hide and seek with old granny. Loves it! Like I said this isn't the best of movie's but if you are in for sum cheesy psycho kid killer fun snatch a copy of this up!

I'm pretty sure that if I knew any of these one dimensional dimwits I'd kill them too. There is also a strange orange hair theme going on, several characters have it.
