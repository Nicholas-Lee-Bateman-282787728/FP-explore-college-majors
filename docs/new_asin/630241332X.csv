His beloved brother who decides to pay two hundred $ to set him free from the jail, his adorable parents and his beloved fiance engenders in him an absolute distorted image of himself, generating a new matrix respect the pouter world.

Somehow this film anticipates later films such the Clockwise Orange, Easy Rider and Hell's angels despite the film focuses in the terrible internal deformation.

465245,1,630241332X,"Based on a novel, which might have been good. Who knows? The screenplay was written by William Inge, obviously a person who lived in an isolated, fantasy world and had no clue as to the way real people spoke to each other, or what motivated their actions. Miscasting abounds - and the dialogue is downright preposterous. This is one step away from a Saturday Night Live skit, only it's too long and after 10 minutes ... it ain't funny!

 Beatty's character is named Berry Berry...Huh? All characters say: ""Hi, Berry Berry!""...""Can we have a conversation in depth, Berry Berry?"" Major cringe inducing.

 That this was produced by a major studio in 1962 is mind boggling. Antiquated nonsense. Beyond redemption. Smart audiences, even at the time, must have gagged. Director, John Frankenhiemer (Who has shown much talent elsewhere) simply phoned this one in. No inspiration. No Nada! A disgrace all around.",1091059200,11,904,5.006666666666667
465246,3,630241332X,"This is one of the small group of films Mr Beatty made after
"" Splendor in the Grass"" and before "" Bonnie and Clyde""
I think its important to appreciate that after "" Splendor...when Mr Beatty was very much in demmand..he did not make programmer types of films. In my opinion he choose very carefully and came up with a thought provoking group of films that live on today as "" what might have been""
"" Lillith"" and "" All Fall Down"" are two of these films.
"" All Fall Down"" written by William Inge( Splendor,,,Picnic etc)
is an artistically unique film about people and their needs and detachments.
Berry Berry( Beatty) and Brandon De Wilde play off each other very well as two brothers totally different( where have we seen that before). The film is well acted from all that include Karl Malden, Ms. Lansbury who turns in another fine tectured performance as the mother..and a very fragile and hopeless Eva Marie Saint
John Frankenheimer's direction and editing is put to good use when there is so much to say visually and very little time to do so. A Real Gem!",1075507200,16,1059,4.520833333333333
465247,5,630241332X,"Why is this film always overlooked? Frankenheimer made it in that same  incredible year (1962) as ""The Birdman of Alcatraz"" and ""The  Manchurian Candidate"". With those two terrific movies, it seems to  form a trilogy of ""monster mother"" tales. Thelma Ritter  (controlling and guilt-tripping in Birdman) and Lansbury (the ultimate  monster mother in Manchurian). Perhaps this was a theme for the director at  the time.
In ""All Fall Down"", Lansbury, as always, stands out  among several other fine performers. Karl Malden is perfectly cast as her  foil, a seemingly passive husband reaching the boiling point. De Wilde and  Saint are both excellent. Watch for the underrated Barbara Baxley as a  lonely school teacher and Evans Evans (Mrs. Frankenheimer) as a prostitute  at the very beginning of the picture. (By the way, what was the story on  Madame Spivy? ""Out! O-A-T!!"" she yells to the De Wilde character  in the bar.) This film is an over-the-top dysfunctional family drama to the  max. There's something unforgettable about Berry Berry (Warren Beatty) and  his tortured interactions with Anabelle. Based on a wonderful novel by J.  L. Herlihy (Midnight Cowboy).See this film, you won't regret it",965606400,23,1201,5.177083333333333

465397,5,630241332X,"I'm not a fan of Warren Beatty.  But I am of Brandon de Wilde who died very young.  This 1962 B & W film has Karl Malden, Angela Lansbury, and Eva Marie Saint in it.  So you know the acting is done by actors who have already proven their acting skill.  Put all four together with a good plot and an unpredictable ending and you have the recipe for an excellent film.  It is unfortunate that they chose not to shoot it in colour.  Karl Malden and Angela Lansbury play a husband and wife.  In one scene, Malden, in a drunken state, decides to bring home three tramps on Christmas Eve which he calls the three wise men.  Lansbury is shocked and fears her house will never be rid of their lice.  Her ploy to get rid of them in the face of Malden is like the wisdom of Solomon.  Beatty is a tour de force, as the primary character and absolute cad who is a young gigolo.  Women are attracted to his good looks like bugs to a candle flame.  I did not care for the ending however.  Most viewers expect Beatty to get his just reward.  I could relate more to this dysfunctional family more than the one depicted in Some Day This Pain Will be Useful to You.

465468,4,630241332X,"I have always been a fan of well-written plays being translated to the big screen.  All Fall Down is no exception, with a stellar cast of actors like Angela Lansbury, Karl Malden and Eva Maria Saint to support Warren Beatty, it is definitely worth watching.  If you watch plays/movies written by Arthur Miller, Tennessee Willianms, Eugene O'Neil and such, you understand that there will not be a fairy tale ending.  It's a story of a true womanizer and roamer who comes home and disrupts the family life.  A story about a younger brother who idolizes Warren Beatty until he sees him for what he genuinely is.  And of course, there will be tragedy that everyone has to cope with and understand how it relates to them.  It is not as powerful as ""Death of a Salesman (the Lee J. Cobb version)"" or ""Streetcar Named Desire"" but certainly ranks among the best movies of this genre.",1318896000,4,875,4.612903225806452

written film, that the name of Warren Beatty's character (BERRY BERRY) is spoken.

Hi Berry Berry.
Gee, Berry Berry, why'd you do that anyway.... BERRY BERRY!
I sure love BERRY BERRY.

It has to be a record of some sort. The person who compared it to a Saturday Night Live sketch was right on target.

Sure, there's a bit of substance lurking under the surface, but I found it to be a truly PAINFUL viewing experience.",1235692800,7,554,4.465346534653466
465474,3,630241332X,"""All Fall Down"" stars Warren Beatty, in one of his earliest roles, as Berry-Berry Willart.  Berry-Berry is a womanizer and perhaps worse, yet he's idolized by his parents (Angela Lansbury & Karl Malden) and kid brother, Clint (Brandon de Wilde).  When Clint visits his brother in Key West, he finds that Berry-Berry has been arrested for roughing up a prostitute.  He bails out Berry-Berry and heads home to Ohio, where his overbearing mother and alcoholic father badger him.  Berry-Berry eventually returns home, to the delight of his family, who obviously manage to overlook his flaws - some would call it denial.  When an attractive family friend (Echo played by Eva Marie Saint) comes to stay with the family, things start to build to a (very predictable) climax.

William Inge (Picnic, Splendor in the Grass) adapted the screenplay from a novel by James Leo Herlihy (Midnight Cowboy, Blue Denim), and John Frankenheimer (Manchurian Candidate) directed.  The main cast has an amazing 11 Oscar nominations among them, and Brandon de Wilde is very good here.  Of course, he seemed to specialize in playing idolizing youngsters - he perfected it in ""Hud"" and ""Shane.""  With this pedigree and cast, ""All Fall Down"" should have been a classic, but it ends up a mess - although a somewhat interesting mess.  There are a couple of problems with the movie, starting with inconsistent characterizations.  In particular, Angela Lansbury's role begins as a clichd overbearing mother, but then she abruptly becomes endearing, before ending as a deluded screecher.  These variations didn't feel natural or organic and didn't seem to reflect actual changes in the character - it was just bad writing.  In addition, there's no build-up in the big dramatic scenes; it almost seems as though scenes are missing.  As a result, I didn't feel any kind of investment in the story or these characters.  Yes, the characters are sometimes quirky (the father is a communist and Clint eavesdrops on people and obsessively records their conversations in a journal), but these quirks don't contribute much to the final product.

I somewhat enjoyed ""All Fall Down,"" as I often like melodramas from this period.  However, this genre is much better represented by ""Splendor in the Grass"" or just about anything by Tennessee Williams.  ""All Fall Down"" is best viewed as second-tier material with some interesting actors saving it from obscurity.",1186790400,3,2417,5.106870229007634
465475,4,630241332X,"""All Fall Down"" combines the best elements of ""Come Back Little Sheba"" and ""Splendor in the Grass""; which should not be a total surprise given that all three come at least in part from the mind of William Inge. It is interesting that while ""All Fall Town"" is the most ambitious of the three, it is also the least known. Probably because Director John Frankenheimer made something that is more art film than box office blockbuster (or academy darling).

The storytelling technique is much like ""Days of Heaven"", both told from the point of view of the youngest member of their casts-in this case Clint (Brandon de Wilde-""come back Shane""). The film even goes so far as to cut in shots of Clint watching the other characters through windows and doorways, and then writing down what he has observed in a journal. This is very effective because the story has coming of age elements involving Clint and the viewer is meant to strongly identify with his character. Unfortunately Frankenheimer pulls his punch at the end and limits things to the traditional process of disillusionment found in this film genre. A much more satisfying ending was possible.

I've never shared the view that ""All Fall Down"" lacks sympathetic characters. Clint is certainly likable as is family friend Echo (Eva Marie Saint), and even father Ralph (Karl Malden) to a certain degree. Mother Annabell (Angela Lansbury) is not but her purpose is to provide some explanation for this dysfunctional family.

Older brother Berry-Berry (Warren Beatty) is not likable but is certainly interesting. Smothered by his mother he has a phobia about ending up like his parents. Which has sent him on the road where he lives by his wits and good looks. Beatty really doesn't seem to know how to play Berry-Berry and his performance is mostly a repeat of his ""Splendor in the Grass"" character. But the uncertainty in his performance ultimately works to his advantage, as Berry-Berry is a conflicted mess of mixed motivation. His behavior is compulsive and contradictory, a sociopath with a conscience. And he is concerned with the welfare of his little brother, who idolizes him (as do his parents).

Starting out in Key West, where Clint meets his brother's ex-girlfriend (played by Frankenheimer's real life wife Evans Evans) in a strip club. In a great scene she tries to get the underage Clint to buy her a drink-but her debilitated coughing spoils any superficial sex appeal.

The action soon shifts to an older middle class neighborhood in Cleveland. Beatty appears briefly in the beginning and is mostly unseen until after the midpoint of the film. De Wille has far more screen time and introduces us to the remaining three characters.

Saint's character is a spinsterish free spirit of 31 (another contradiction) who Clint falls in love with until his older brother claims her. Saint was always difficult to cast. Not earthy enough for the Julie Harris-Elizabeth Hartman type of roles and not sexy enough for the standard starlet stuff she was limited to icy librarians or dowdy girlfriend stuff until Hitchcock drew her out in ""North by Northwest"". She is physically perfect for the Echo O'Brien role, someone confident and playful, yet very fragile; pretty enough to make Berry-Berry's attraction credible.

This is a slick little film but only if you like productions that could easily transfer to the stage.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1160956800,18,3422,4.949477351916376
465476,5,630241332X,"Two parents- the Willarts, whose names sound a lot like Willfarts- are a feuding couple with no class, no direction, and little acting skill. I mean really, who are these people? Can't they understand they we're trying to understand their problems? Their insecurities? And perhaps dump all of ours onto their lives. All they do is complain about their silly son, Berry-Berry, apparently named after some tropical disease. Well Berry-Berry seems to be able to get it up, which is more than I can say for his parents, and this time with an older woman named Echo O'Brien, which has got to be one of the silliest names that a set of parents could ever name their daughter! Dear God, why can't he just settle down and find a nice woman to have babies with? What's' all these silly-named women doing trouncing around in his life? And why can't he get a real job? He really gets his parents at each others' throats, and he really gets on my nerves.

465477,4,630241332X,"""All Fall Down"" is a drama laced with occasional comedy and whimsy that examines the effect that a spoiled, irresponsible drifter named Barry Barry has upon his well-meaning family and upon the innocent young woman who unfortunately falls in love with him.

Barry Barry is a young man in his twenties who has never had a steady job.  But because of his killer good looks women (especially those who are lonely) throw themselves at him.  Barry Barry uses these women as meal tickets.  He regards them as pathetic, and he treats them indifferently or cruelly.

Barry Barry is self-loathing.  His well-intentioned parents have over-indulged him.  They tolerate and enable his reckless and sometimes violent behavior.  He returns home at Christmas time after his parents bail him out of jail for assaulting a woman.  There he meets Echo whose parents are friends of his parents.  She is there for a brief visit.

Echo is a vivacious, single woman about 10 years older than Barry Barry.  She is self-sufficient and has a career.  She is also recovering from the tragic suicide of an alcoholic man whom she befriended.

Barry Barry is immediatly attracted to the beautiful and warm-hearted Echo.  But when he finds out that she is pregnant with his child, he runs away from her leading to events that change the attitudes and lives of those who love him.

""All Fall Down"" has fine performances from an extremely talented cast which includes Warren Beatty as Barry Barry, Karl Malden and Angela Lansbury as his adoring parents, and a teenage Brandon De Wilde as Barry Barry's idealistic younger brother who has himself fallen in love with Echo.  The highly respected John Frankenheimer directs this movie crisply and effectively.

""All Fall Down"" is an excellent production worthy of a large audience.",1127606400,30,1794,4.9630872483221475
