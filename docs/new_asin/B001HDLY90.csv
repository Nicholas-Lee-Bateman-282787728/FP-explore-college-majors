3630271,5,B001HDLY90,"I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift and she loves it!  The video is great for someone getting into the sport. Not only does Julie show the basic poses and positions, but also shows tips and tricks to bring out the competitors better features.  The video also includes timed practice sessions.

I received the item on time and a personal thank you from Julie included was a nice touch.",1230336000,5,394,4.444444444444445
8308679,3,B001HDLY90,"This video is for the absolute beginner. Its pretty basic... I felt like it was a waste of money (paid $49 for it) and didn't learn anything I already didn't know from watching you tube and google. I did like the part of the video where you can practice posing, you can never practice enough! So if you are brand spanking new to this lifestyle and don't know the difference between bikini, figure, and physique then this video may be good for you.",1417132800,,447,4.397590361445783
8308680,5,B001HDLY90,"This video has some great tips for posing and what to expect in competition. Also has examples of fitness/flexibility moves. It has been really helpful and I would recommend anyone new to the fitness competition to purchase. Would love to see more about suits, makeup and hair, and other aspects of the competition.",1367798400,2,315,4.962264150943396
8308681,2,B001HDLY90,"For a 45 min. DVD, I found it to be way overpriced. There is some good information, but for $45 you could Google it!",1366502400,4,116,3.875
8308682,4,B001HDLY90,The DVD itself is very basic and as someone who had not competed before watching it I would have like a bit more detail on transitions from pose to pose and overall walk/presentation. A personal note from Julie definitely was a wonderful touch.,1363910400,3,244,4.6976744186046515
8308683,5,B001HDLY90,I highly recommend this DVD if you are planning on comepeting in figure or fitness competitions. I watched this over and over before my first figure show and spent hours in front of the mirror and it helped me win my very first time on stage. Posing was the one thing I was confindent with after watching and practicing with this video.,1334707200,10,336,4.435483870967742
8308684,5,B001HDLY90,Great video! It was my first figure competion and I placed in the top 5. Thanks julie. I loved the personal note as well! She is a great role model!,1320624000,,148,3.966666666666667
8308685,5,B001HDLY90,"I am an NPC figure competitor, physical therapist, and former personal trainer.

A portion of competition preparation, as anyone involved with figure, fitness, or bikini knows, is practicing posing. Your posing is the only means YOU, as a competitor, have to show off your hard work & dedication.  Also, it can make the difference between placing or not.

Someone that has competed many times, and has practiced for hours/days/ or maybe even months, can make the poses look effortless, and that is deceiving.  There is nothing easy or effortless with competition posing.  Personally, I have researched posing, read about it, watched you tube videos about it, and have actually received face-to-face instruction all prior to ordering Julie's DVD.  I would practice almost daily in front of my mirror with my kids and husband providing feedback.  Inevitably, though, when it came time to walk across the stage and present the physique that I had worked SO HARD on, I felt completely unprepared.

I knew for my most recent competition, I had to do something different with respect to posing.  I knew I needed more help and I knew I wanted that help to be from a professional.  Even though I'm in an area where I could attend posing classes, I certainly didn't have that time.  Every time I searched for ""the best posing DVD"" or ""most recommended posing DVD"", Julie's would come up.  It was recommended from both fitness and figure competitors alike.  I knew it would be an asset.  But, I had no idea what a surprise I was in for!

It was literally less than two weeks away from my first show of the season.  I figured, why not, go ahead and order now.  It'll either come a few days before, or just after, my first show but at least I would have it for all future competitions.  So, I placed my order.  That was Friday afternoon.  By Friday evening I had a shipping confirmation email and the DVD arrived on MONDAY!  Plus, there was a hand written post card from Julie included.  Personal, professional, and high quality....and I hadn't even watched the DVD yet!

The DVD did not disappoint.  I watched the entire thing by myself twice. My husband watched it one additional time with me.  Julie gives excellent, clear, concise, and demonstrative advice and information. As mentioned, I compete in NPC figure.  There is extensive information for fitness as well.  The part I was most interested in was posing:  mandatory posing and the ""pretty"" or ""personal"" poses.  Julie has two excellent models that demonstrate her every instruction; the correct and incorrect way to present yourself.  In addition, Julie has actual contest footage of amateurs and professionals.

Another nice surprise was that it was easier for my husband to critique and refine my poses because Julie pointed out from the bottom up, the way each portion of my body should be presented.

But of course, the proof is in the pudding, right?  I've only competed in level V shows, and have always placed last.  The show after I received Julie's DVD and practiced with it?  I placed 5th in both of my divisions.  What a sweet reward.

Buy this DVD.  You, as a competitor are doing everything possible to ensure your best showing.  Don't let this invaluable tool pass you by! GOOD LUCK!",1301961600,27,3247,4.781981981981982
8308686,3,B001HDLY90,"I am prepping for my first figure show and purchased this about 6 months ago.  The video is a bit hokey but it is informative and has helped me with my over-all presence.  It needs to be more Federation specific as to what NPC will allow v/s IFBB...  I had to ask around to see what was correct v/s what the video instructed to do.

The video is a nice reference but pay the money to get some one on one time with a coach.",1299196800,,422,3.929411764705882
8308687,4,B001HDLY90,"Julie's video is a great way to get a posing coach into your own living room. She does a phenomenal job of breaking down every aspect of posing, including little tips and tricks that work with your physique. She shows you how you can move to camouflage any remaining flaws. I'd love to see more on the individual routines; but there is enough material to get started.

A nice bonus was a personally signed postcard from Julie with best wishes. That little touch blew me away!",1289692800,,475,4.523255813953488
8308688,5,B001HDLY90,"I ordered this video because my first competition is 20 weeks away, and I cannot find any posing coaches locally.  Julie goes over each mandatory pose in detail and offers several variations on each one that will help emphasize your best body features.  After some practice, I'm sure I will look confident on-stage.  I recommend this dvd to anyone getting started in figure or fitness! Thanks Julie!",1264204800,5,399,4.925373134328358
