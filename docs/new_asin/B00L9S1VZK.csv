6478494,4,B00L9S1VZK,"Andy Lau does a good job as cop. The plot is a bit difficult to follow, but does fall into place eventually. This is a great action flick with lots of high-power gun battles and explosions reminiscent of Heat (Al Pacino). Don't look for any deep meaning or revelations, just watch it for the entertainment value. Definitely get this one in Blu-ray, however, as some of the cinematography is quite stunning.",1414627200,3,406,4.732394366197183

6478497,4,B00L9S1VZK,"I just got this blu-ray in the mail and i am sure it is a good movie. That is why i am giving it four stars. I will update my review after my initial viewing. However, i wanted to warn everyone who is interested in purchasing this film that it is NOT in Mandarin Chinese as advertised on Amazon's webpage and even on the back of the box. Both have Mandarin and Cantonese as the languages listed, but only Cantonese is available. The disc itself only offers Cantonese when you select SETUP on the menu. I am very disappointed because Mandarin films rarely get a decent release in the US, so i was looking forward to this as i do not speak Cantonese.

Just an FYI for anyone picking this up under the impression it is in Mandarin.",1411603200,4,728,4.27536231884058
6478498,3,B00L9S1VZK,"As a more recent large-scale action thriller, Firestorm does deliver what it emphatically glorifies, which is loud, reckless action. Unfortunately, it also tries to push a plot and cast of characters that can't match the onscreen destruction. First off, I'd recommend buying the Blu-Ray version. The only extras that might please the English-speaking audience is a photo gallery (I said ""might""), but you should get the Blu-Ray for its ability to truly show off the film's visual chaos and its dynamic sound.

The main premise of Firestorm involves an inspector, played by Andy Lau, trying to take down a multitude of Hong Kong criminals. How the director scripts out this story is perhaps the film's central problem. Without spoiling the important parts of the movie, there are plenty of moments involving the villains that don't make much sense once you start to think about them. Then again, these poorly conceived moments are consistent with how cliched and bland the bad guys are. Even To (played by Gordon Lam), the ex-convict who becomes Lui's informant, doesn't provide anything new that we haven't seen from other crime films like Infernal Affairs. Likewise, buried underneath all of the noise and chaos, there are at least some signs of an intelligent, original movie like Infernal Affairs trying to burst out. This is especially true of the second half of the film, when all of the somewhat unnecessary subplots gets pushed out and the intricacies of the main characters start to really kick in. Firestorm is a great action movie, but as a crime thriller, it's not as imaginative as it thinks it is.

Andy Lau does commit well to his decently developed character, which isn't a big surprise given his already storied acting career. The rest of the cast get the job done, and nothing more. That's less on them than it is on the screenplay they're forced to work with. Otherwise, the rest of the film is just mindless, hectic fun, and Firestorm accomplishes that quite well. As long as you let go of how ridiculous some of the action scenes are (look no further than the film's decision on how physics work), it's almost impossible not to enjoy them. Just realize that the rest of the film is quite a different level of fun.",1408579200,7,2233,4.842931937172775

8664742,4,B00L9S1VZK,"If you are a fan of Andy Lau and like action-packed movies of his. I think ""Shockwave"" is better than this.  I skipped some of the contents even though it turned out to be above-average.  As far as ""Shockwave"" is concerned, it certainly kept me at the edge of my seat.  I do find the subtitles are too small, but yet I fully understand Cantonese and Mandarin, so I don't have any problems with it.  Otherwise you might want to give a 2nd thought before renting this movie.",1511654400,,472,4.329545454545454

8664746,5,B00L9S1VZK,"A Cantonese cop plays dirty in order to stop a criminal gang that has been pulling daytime robberies which have frightened the citizens and shamed the police. firestorm was yet ANOTHER lucky find on Netflix, I loved it and I'm glad I found it. its premise is basically a cross between Dirty Harry and the town since it involves a dirty cop and a group of criminals. right from the get go, there is nonstop action and suspense as well as a lot of stuff getting blown up, it's quite loud too, but the louder the better I say and it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. anyway, firestorm is the most fun heist flick I've seen in a while and I gladly recommend it to my fellow action junkies. P.S. the 18 minute shootout in queen street at the end is easily the highlight and is the best shootout scene I've ever watched",1472342400,,837,4.2375

8664749,5,B00L9S1VZK,"I saw this last fall, 2014, when it was first released on DVD and I revisited it again, now, in the fall of 2015. I rarely do that. Basically a classical crime action flick with really smart bad guys against somewhat smart cops. Yes, it's just another armored car heist (well, a couple of them) with lots of firepower. Normally I would say it was all a bit excessive, over-the-top firepower, destruction and killing, but the pace, cinematography, exceptional CGI scenes of downtown Hong Kong with unexpected and creative twists made me stay involved and, always a good sign, not much dead time (ha) so it went quickly.

What makes it a little more special than other films in this genre is that the good people
may not make it in the end. But, then too, neither do the not-so-good people.",1441065600,,788,4.588652482269503
8664750,4,B00L9S1VZK,lots of action at the end (not that I like only actions).  just wish the end was more satisfying like letting the guy to be with his true love at the end.,1440028800,,154,3.8125
