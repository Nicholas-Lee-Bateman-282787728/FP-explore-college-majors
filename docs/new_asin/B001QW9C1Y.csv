8336613,4,B001QW9C1Y,"""Cape No. 7"" (""Hi-kak chhit-ho""), the second biggest box-office hit in the history of Taiwan (only second to ""Titanic""), is a romantic drama set in and around Hengchun, a city located in the southernmost part of Taiwan. Written and directed by Te-Sheng Wei, his sophomore work as director is overlong (uncut version is about 130 minutes long) and its story sometimes gets a little unfocused, but wait and be patient, because ""Cape No. 7"" finally pays off with the truly moving finale.

The film begins with a young man's monologue in Japanese. This is actually a love letter from a Japanese teacher leaving Taiwan in 1945, after the surrender of his country. Japan's occupation of Taiwan is over, and he has to leave the school and his love, a girl named Tomoko Kojima (Rachel Liang), never to meet her again.

The brief prelude is followed by the main story set in today's Hengchun, where a failed musician Aga (Van Fan) is living an aimless life. One day he is told to replace the injured mailman Old Mao (Johnny C.J. Lin), but Aga is not serious about the job, and (illegally) takes the letters to his home. Then Aga discovers old letters in a package from Japan. On the package is written ""Cape No. 7,"" an old address that no one seems to remember now.

Meanwhile, for the upcoming concert of popular Japanese singer Kousuke Atari (played by the singer himself) organized by a local resort hotel, Tomoko (Chie Tanaka) is assigned a difficult and thankless job of collecting the members of the band. Tomoko really wants to be a fashion model, but her dream will not be likely to come true. That's when Tomoko meets Aga (and other colorful band members) and falls into an unexpected romantic relationship.

To me, what is unexpected is the genuine emotional impact at the end of the film, where a famous Schubert song is effectively used as a link between two generations. The script is uneven with too many characters and subplots, and the pacing is to slow at times, but very strong finale makes up for the flaws. Obviously Te-Sheng Wei has made the film with sincerity and faith in the material, a love story worth telling.

I imagine some part of the film (languages, for instance) is lost on the audiences outside Taiwan like me. Even so, ""Cape No. 7"" is a very good film with moving moments.",1266969600,9,2299,4.652709359605911
