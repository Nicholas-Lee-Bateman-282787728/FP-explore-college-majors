8482828,2,B005Q13014,"Seemed to be little more than a compilation of low quality, shaky home videos. I would have expected more from National Geographic.",1403654400,,131,5.0
8482829,4,B005Q13014,Good program with lots of good footage. Only issue is NGC burns their DVDs so it won't work with all DVD players.,1399075200,,113,4.181818181818182
8482830,5,B005Q13014,"---------the length of the film.  Dragged just a little on the college campus damage, but it was very well done and was so well laid out as the swarm progressed that at no time did I get bored, very much the opposite and the footage they assembled from so many private videos to flesh this out was very good.  Storm lovers will really like this and lots of re-watch value, so will really suggest getting it.",1377043200,2,407,4.342105263157895
8482831,5,B005Q13014,"This is not meant to be entertainment, or any vicarious thrill ride, but rather an informative review of what actually happened by those who were there. This is what a stormchaser, or those who want to be, should be seeing, and what those who value the science should be showing. This is also news and history, as this did actually happen and there was little left out as to the destruction these storms caused, and left little to the imagination as to the power tornadoes possess. While I have seen tornado videos before, I was often disappointed because of the circus like atmosphere of storm chasers mugging and clowning for the camera, when what most who are interested in the science would rather see what they are chasing. While I admire and laud what they do,for the most part, what they are after is no clown act, but a very real, and deadly phenomenon of nature. National Geographic has always been about the pursuit of science,history,education and the truth,and while what they showed was horrific,it is, and continues to be valuable in research and knowledge. This film is one I would recommend for serious review.",1361059200,4,1126,4.779487179487179
8482832,3,B005Q13014,"Some great footage, but it seemed to be rushed into production.  It does not hang together well.  I wish the editing had been more professional.",1354752000,,144,4.72
8482833,5,B005Q13014,I first saw this show on TV and also remember watching these outbreaks live on the weather channel. Fascinating eyewitness video that really puts a unedited perceptive on real people and what they saw.,1331596800,5,201,4.9411764705882355
