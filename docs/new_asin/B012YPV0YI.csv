8726779,5,B012YPV0YI,"Every movie in this collection had great sound & picture quality when played through my player.  The choice of movies for this collection range from stories based on fact to mostly action adventure stories.  Some stories have elements of comedy but lean mostly towards action adventure.  My personal two favorites in this collection are "" Shooter"" & "" Four Brothers"".  "" The Perfect Storm"" is a emotional action adventure based on true events, but takes cinematic liberty's to carry the story of the sword fishing boat that lost all hands during this historic storm.  "" The Corrupter"" was a nice surprise for me as it had flew under my radar & purchasing this collection introduced me to this movie which I found very enjoyable & well written.  Last & in my personal opinion least enjoyable is "" Three Kings"" which felt to me like a poor attempt at remaking "" Kelly's Heroes"" set in the Middle east.",1519344000,,899,4.694267515923567
