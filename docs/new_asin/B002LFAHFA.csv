8372952,5,B002LFAHFA,"Fabulous photography, charming narration.  I think this is the best Nature series documentary I have seen.  They are usually too clinical for me.  Not this one:  warm and personal.  Don't miss it!",1377475200,3,196,5.0
8372953,3,B002LFAHFA,I was expecting a video that showed the falls and what to see and do whle there but it was a story of a local fisherman and his experiences with the falls year round. The pictures were good and it showed the animals that come to the falls.,1376611200,3,239,4.0

8372956,5,B002LFAHFA,"I recently visited Victoria Falls and found it impossible to describe the beauty and grandeur of the entire area - this DVD does just that.  Not only did it contain great scenes of the falls but also of the Zambezi River, the wildlife in the area - and a snapshot of the lovely Zambian people and their culture.  And I appreciated the fact that there was minimal wildlife eating wildlife.  Thanks for a great DVD.",1269475200,9,413,4.48
8372957,5,B002LFAHFA,"This DVD is worth it, but, if you're like me, you'd prefer a Blu-Ray. When the Blu-Ray didn't show up in my search, I assumed there wasn't one. So I bought this. I'm now kicking myself, because I found the same content on Blu-Ray under the title ""Nature: Amazing Places: Africa,"" which is available on Amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nature-Amazing-Places-Africa-Blu-ray/dp/B002PQ1PC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nature: Amazing Places: Africa [Blu-ray</a>]. You can't go wrong whichever choice you make, but you should be aware that there is a choice.",1256860800,6,601,6.432098765432099
