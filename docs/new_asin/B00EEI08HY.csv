8604750,5,B00EEI08HY,I really enjoyed watching the highlights of mat action in one of the hottest wresting territories in the Southwest. It was really exciting to see the Sheepherders when they were among the most dangerous tag teams of their day To see Bruiser Brody in action could only bring back wonderful memories for his fans.,1444608000,,311,4.777777777777778
