8265729,4,B0017DHKHA,"My favorite out of this bundled set is Barefoot Contessa's (Ina Garten)recipies. She has some winners here like her, Blue Cheese Burgers, and East Hampton Clam Chowder, both of which I have made, and I felt like I was eating out at a great restaurant they were so good. I followed her recipes exactly, but if you cannot find fresh clams, the large can of clams in clam juice is available at Costco and works great too. My other favorites is her Salad with Warm Goat Cheese, and Sour Cream Coffee Cake. Paula has some good recipies too like her tomato Canapes, Molten Lava Cake, and Red Velvet Cake. Giada De Laurentiis was my least favorite, I'm not a big fan of Italian Food, and after a while I couldn't take her personality. Ina is pleasant to watch, and Paula is just funny and entertaining.",1413158400,2,795,4.489655172413793
