7999181,5,B0000CEB60,"Haven't seen or heard much from John Michael Montgomery for awhile, and that's a shame, because he's pretty terrific.
This whole DVD is chock full of excellent videos of his songs - all well done, amusing, and totally professional.
To say nothing about his singing.
He's as good a country artist as I've ever heard, especially among the newer ones.  He combines a great talent with a sincere feel for his material, and doesn't hoke it up with gimmickry, or overwhelming special effects.
He just sings, from the heart, and it is way good.",1322438400,2,537,4.712765957446808
7999182,5,B0000CEB60,John Michael Montgomery has the best sense of classic country videos. He has a variety of videos from an auction to a little cafe and the The Little Girl is a heartwarming video. John like many artist have a way of making you laugh and cry with a video collection.,1179100800,2,264,4.3
7999183,4,B0000CEB60,"This is a decent collection of John Michael Montgomery's videos. He actually makes some good ones. ""Life's a Dance"" and ""No Man's Land"", among others, are included on this impressive DVD. You might like it if you like JMM. I recommend this one.",1162512000,,244,4.6976744186046515
7999184,5,B0000CEB60,"I love this collection.  A lot of the videos from earlier in his career are very rarely played.  It's nice to be able to see them when I choose.  My personal favorite is the touching video tribute to his father, ""I Miss You A Little"".  All the videos are good, and I'm looking forward to John Michael Montgomery's next audio CD coming out.  Until then, this is good.",1076976000,7,366,4.323529411764706
