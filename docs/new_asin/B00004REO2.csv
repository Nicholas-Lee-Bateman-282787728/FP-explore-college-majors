7920914,5,B00004REO2,"Cowboy Bebop is a good mix of action and comedy made into a very well designed anime series. Spike is a bountyhunter who is trying to recover his past, while at the same time earn some cash. Teaming up with Jet who is an ex-copper, Spike bumps into more people he'd rather not, such as Faye the ""trouble-maker"" of the group. I won't give away too much more information about cowboy bebop other than this: Cowboy bebop is a must-have collection.",1061164800,,444,4.493827160493828
7920915,5,B00004REO2,"SWEET MOTHER OF GOD!!THIS IS ABSOLOUTELY THE BEST ANIME EVER!! I can't POSSIBLY think of ANYTHING that could make it better. Everything about this anime: PERFECT. It has everything. Spaceships, Cowboys, Gunfights, Sexy Males (a.k.a. Spike, Vicious and Gren :D) Women with attitude, kick ... fight scenes, amazing animation, awesome storylines for each episode, Great music, comedy, cute little dogs, and crazy little genius kids. You don't even have to be a hardcore anime lover to ABSOLOUTELY ADORE this series. It is soo worth every cent! You'll love it so much, you'll go out and buy the second one. I did!",1024617600,,609,5.03960396039604
7920916,5,B00004REO2,"Some people watch TV shows just because it is there.  But I would have to say this is an artistic show with a capativating story line.  That is what the TV was originally made for.  Best of all, it is anime!
The time is 2070.  Humans have teraformed planets and moons to be habital.  People have personal space ships, and people have gone around the entire solar system, though nobody has gone out of the solar system.
OK, so you have Spike who was a former Syndicate member, a gang of organized criminals.  He is the cool guy in the story.  Then there is Jet, who owns the ship, the Bebop.  That would be the person that moves the story along.  He is a former policeman.  There is Feye, who was chryogenically frozen for 50 years.  Finally, you have Ed and Ein.  My favorite duo.  Ed is a wierd girl, a hacker, though you might mistake her for a guy.  Ein is a dog that was created in a laboratory to be the smartest dog around.
This is a show I would highly recomend.",1015372800,,969,4.195652173913044
7920917,5,B00004REO2,"This is anime at its absolute best!
It is about the adventures of interplanetary bounty hunters, called ""cowboys"", and their spaceship called ""Bebop"".
No punches are pulled in this gritty series, it is meant for teenagers or adults and rightfully so.
I recommend it.",1014940800,,266,5.068181818181818

7920919,5,B00004REO2,"Let me tell you this, I went into this series knowing absolutely nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada. As soon as I popped in the tape and saw the first episode, I was stunned. I cannot begin to describe this series, for mere words cannot express the artistic endevors for this series. THe music is spotless, and the visuals are some of the best I've seen. If anything, go out and get or download the sountracks to this series (preferably buy) cuz it *is* one of the best out there. This is the beginning to the series, and the second half is just breathtaking. This goes down as One of the Best Anime Series of all time, and in my opinion, ranks side by side with Evangelion and Escaflowne. Look for Cowboy Bebop to air on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim on Sunday, September 2. Also go to Adult swim's site, [...] And lastly, GET THIS SERIES NOW!",998697600,3,835,4.393548387096774
7920920,5,B00004REO2,"I've seen a lot of Anime, and I've seen some excellent anime, but this series is easily the best. It's dubbing quality is unmatched, with spectacular voice talents. (Spike = robot guy from Toonami) The action is awesome, the writing and storylines are so much fun. But the best is the music! The background music is some of the best ever. Beats the heck out of DBZ.",994809600,,365,4.462686567164179
7920921,5,B00004REO2,"Cowboy Bebop is excellent from beginning to end.  I recommend getting the DVDs, they will be gentler on the wallet and have a great menu.  This is a series that has great animation, great story, and great music.  It's not very often that a series will come along that has all three of those.  If you are at all a fan of Lupin, the lead character of Bebop is similar.  If you are at all a fan of music, try one of a dozen CDs for this series.  They are all great.  The title of each episode in the series references a song.  There are some really great references in the show, from the clever to the obscure.  And did I mention the artwork is great?  Give it a try!",976060800,,664,4.038461538461538
