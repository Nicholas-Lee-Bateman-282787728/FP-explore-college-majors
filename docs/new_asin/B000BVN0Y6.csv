8093342,4,B000BVN0Y6,"Over all we loves this product. We received it promptly and in the condition promised. The only down side which is no fault of the sellers is the sound quality of the DVD which is probably attributed to the age of the recordings or the people who produced the DVD. There is a static type noise through the entire DVD but it is not overwhelming and you soon grow accustomed to it; it does not overly detract from your viewing experience.

The quality of the shows themselves more than makes up for the less than perfect sound quality. Both of the stories told on the DVD where simplistic yet very well told and entertaining. Not to mention thought provoking and at times moving. Watching 'A string of blue beads and A star shall rise' will now be a part of our christmas traditions and if you enjoy wholesome themes that harken back to a simpler purer time then you too will want to add this DVD to your collection.",1295049600,4,914,4.408284023668639
8093343,3,B000BVN0Y6,"The reviews here are put under numerous items.  This is for the Westlake Ent. edition which contains only 2 film shorts, and for which there does not seem to be any other reviews.  ""A Star Shall Rise"" is from the tv series Family Theater and features Raymond Burr in a story of the Three Wise Men.  The film is complete with a couple of splices during dialogue, and has a good amount of background noise.  ""A String of Blue Beads"" is an unsold 1953 pilot for an anthology series and is in color.  It features Louis Jourdan and Margaret Hamilton.  There is one bad splice and may be slightly missing a little footage.  Otherwise, the films are quite entertaining.",1286755200,4,662,4.512605042016807
