7685127,5,B01CO70L2I,"Normally, high quality historical drama is associated with British television.  This time, the French have shown that they are equal to the task.  The entire series is superb, with an excellent sense of history, tense plot lines and some fine acting.  I found the entire series to be one of the best that I have ever seen on television.",1468540800,5,336,4.661016949152542
7685128,5,B01CO70L2I,I still can't recommend this highly enough. We've been following these characters for 4 years now-This season is set in 1943-The german's are starting to lose the war and we see the rise of the resistance more prominently The characters are so well written And so believable You get so attached to them! enjoy,1468281600,,309,4.7407407407407405

7685130,5,B01CO70L2I,"Great series! Problem with disc 1, episode 2, a glitch 8 minutes into the episode has the DVD jump back to the menu. I pressed FF right as the scene starts with the guys asleep in the barn (with the glitch) then PLAY and was able to continue watching the whole episode. Both the original DVD I ordered and the replacement DVD had this glitch. Amazon should correct this and reissue disc 1. The rest of the season 4 episodes played correctly. Love this series!",1466985600,3,459,4.411764705882353
7685131,5,B01CO70L2I,"Love the series but had a problem with Disc 1 Episode 2.  It only plays 8 minutes into the episode, then stops and returns to the main menu.  I thought I had a bad disc so I returned the discs to Amazon, was sent new package, tried Disc 1 Episode 2 again and the same thing happened.  Has anyone else had this problem?
Update: Using FF before you get to the glitch, then Play, as reviewer suggested works.  Thanks for the info!",1466640000,,427,4.170731707317073

7685133,5,B01CO70L2I,"More gripping episodes about this brave French town under Nazi occupation. Some can't believe that the Germans are doing genocide, but they discover the awful truth. Some anti-Semitic French collaborate, but other officials start dragging their feet. NOTE, there is confusion between the French and the English on the numbering of years; there are 12 episodes per chronological year.",1491264000,,383,5.508474576271187

7685136,5,B01CO70L2I,"My husband and I love A French Village. We started with it last year when I bought Season 1 to ""test it out."" Now, we have the series through Season 5 and will buy 6 when it is available. It is a great series with excellent character development. Set during the Nazi occupation of France, it reminds us of what life was like under the authoritarian regimes of the fascist nations in Europe during WWII. I highly recommend the series. You will love some characters and hate others (both French and German). There are no real ""heroes"" here...just human beings who do both good and bad things. It's wartime. It has English subtitles for the French dialogue.",1486857600,2,654,4.598290598290598

7685144,5,B01CO70L2I,"this is a superb season of a fabulous televison series.  The moral dilemnas faced by the characters are brought out with extraordinary acting and dialogue.  it made me think and think some more.  I urge everyone to watch A French Village It is so realistic, and it only happened 75 years ago.  It is one of the very best television series that I have ever seen.",1476144000,5,361,4.424242424242424

7685150,4,B01CO70L2I,"We love this series but do NOT Appreciate getting in this Season 4 dvd a dud.
  The  First show in Disc 4  in  the box is a repeat of Episode 9
from the 3rd disc in this box!!!
So we're short one episode so far,  and Hope that this type loss will not happen again.
These DVDS are not cheap!  It would be nice if it were replaced, but I don't imagine that will happen.",1469836800,,367,3.8133333333333335
7685151,5,B01CO70L2I,"I have been watching this whole series. I am anxious for the sixth season to be released. It is so compelling that I think about it long after I finish watching it. I know our parents and grandparents in the United States dealt with hardships during World War II but, compared to what was happening to the people in Europe and how they had to fight for survival on a daily basis, it is hard to compare the two. I can't imagine what life was like for the people no matter what part of Europe they lived in. Who could you really trust? Being in the wrong place at the wrong time or looking at someone a certain way that they felt was not respectful or maybe they were just in a bad mood, could get you killed in a heart beat. I got stressed just watching it and can't fathom living day to day worrying about my children having enough to eat or clothes to stay warm in the cold. Some of these people made great sacrifices and some did what they felt they had to do to survive. This series is a real eye opener and I feel so fortunate to have been born in the USA!",1469577600,6,1060,4.076555023923445
7685152,5,B01CO70L2I,"Have just finished the season and am absolutely glued to the stories woven around these characters.  The fact that they are based on true events makes them even more compelling to watch.  The actress who plays Hortense captivates me.  She acted in the ""Spiral"" series and I was so pleased to have her in a major role.  I can recommend this series to all who love the intrigue and playing out of the twists and turns of a good story line.  Superb!!  Now on to viewing season 5....",1469491200,,479,4.386363636363637

8753517,1,B01CO70L2I,Dvd One is supposed to have episodes 1-3 but dvd one on both sets of Season 4 of a French Village that I ordered only has 2 episodes on dvd one so there is obviously a problem with the Season Four sets. I want a refund on both sets. Thank You.,1523491200,,243,3.784313725490196

8753519,5,B01CO70L2I,"A FRENCH VILLAGE (Un Village Francais), season 4  1943
2012 / MHz Network / 812m (4 dscs) / $39.95 / NR
 About a year or so ago I had the opportunity to review the first three seasons of this French production and I found it so impressive I leaped at the chance to watch further seasons (review of the fifth and sixth seasons will follow in the weeks ahead). Set in the fictional village of Villaneuve, on the border between France and Germany, the show depicts its occupation by the Nazis during World War II. The populaces reaction is across the spectrum: Some openly welcome the soldiers and members of the Gestapo, some try to walk a fine line between following their dicta and protecting the Jewish members of the community while still others create resistance groups and hide out in the countryside whilst planning terroristic attacks. Allegiances and romantic relationships shift  the mayors promiscuous wife is, in this season, the consort of a Gestapo officer, for instance. This may sound like the stuff of soap opera but its not. The shifting alliances serve the plotting  rather than the other way round  and complicate matters for all concerned in sometimes unexpected ways.
 Bringing you up to speed if youve not seen the first three seasons is a hopeless task. My advice  nay, my insistence  is that you get hold of the earlier seasons and get hooked on what is grand drama with historic accuracy (creators Frederic Krevine and Philippe Trevoit have a historian on staff). There is no better or rewarding binge watching. (Rather than sampling my way through  a common practice when reviewing TV series  Ive been watching every episode.) Plots and counterplots are the order of the day; my favorite involves the decision by a group of young resistance fighters to stage a parade. They make elaborate plans to lead the Germans astray while the Nazis, getting wind that something is brewing, try to figure out just what and how to foil it. This season also  be warned  features the departure of a number of prominent characters; some are shockingly killed off while others disappear or have fates unresolved at the cliffhanger. The season signals that no character  no matter how beloved  is safe. I cant wait to get to the next season.",1510704000,,2248,4.805194805194805

8753522,5,B01CO70L2I,"Overall, the best series I've ever watched. I'm now almost finished with series 5, which was a bit dissapointing, but only when compared with the first 4 seasons. Great acting and casting. There are always multiple story lines running, and occasionally they end rather abruptly or jump to a strange conclusions. But I'm nitpicking. I am emotionally invested in the characters and their stories and I dread the series end.",1500508800,,421,5.0285714285714285
