4938159,4,B0063HO5BE,This documentary is pretty much exactly what I expected it to be.  It's a candid look at the lives of career MMO games and what leads them there.,1377129600,,145,4.178571428571429
4938160,5,B0063HO5BE,"I was unaware of Second Life until seeing this documentary. The filmmakers did an excellent job of revealing the different storylines they covered in an interesting way, while also providing the view of those who created the site. It was compelling to watch and very well-edited. An excellent documentary if you want to learn more about any aspect of Second Life and its impact on people and society.",1376352000,2,400,4.897058823529412
4938161,5,B0063HO5BE,"This movie is amazing and freaky at the same time.  My husband watched with me and then I lent it out to some friends.  It is perplexing to the mind what kind of people get involved with Second Life.  It is sad, yet facinating.  A great Sociology study can be completed from the people in this movie.",1364083200,,300,4.2105263157894735
4938162,4,B0063HO5BE,"Kind of fascinating to see the relationship of the real people to their Second Life icons. Some are what you might expect in terms of being  overweight computer nerds, but others actually do look like their attractive avatars and are more like people who would in an earlier time sign up for a dating service. Interesting how Second Life effects people's real lives, at least for heavy users.",1359331200,,392,4.764705882352941
4938163,5,B0063HO5BE,"I had no idea of this virtual world before I watched the documentary.  It is Farmville X 1,000 in time-wasting, non-productive behavior.  You could learn a new skill if you devoted that much time to it.",1355961600,,202,4.583333333333333
4938164,1,B0063HO5BE,"But he picked the absolute slimiest people to interview. Is an avatar sex scene really necessary? I think not. If the director had chosen a range of people, it would have been much more realistic.",1355702400,,196,4.628571428571429
4938165,5,B0063HO5BE,"Life 2.0 is one of the most interesting documentaries I've seen. The stark realism captured in this film sheds real insight into not just virtual environments such as Second Life but, the entire phenomenon of meeting and interacting with other people online. I think this documentary will probably mean even more to people who have experienced anything close to what is covered in it.",1333411200,5,384,5.015625
4938166,5,B0063HO5BE,"Life 2.0 is an astonishingly meaningful and entertaining look at the subculture of Second Life. The film tracks several people through their engagement and sometimes addiction with the online 3D virtual reality world. One woman sells enormous and immaculate virtual homes for real money in second life, while living in squalor in her parent's basement, working in her pajamas twenty hours a day. Another couple, who turn out to look surprisingly similar to their extremely attractive avatars, fall in love on Second Life and their relationship spills into first life with unexpected consequences. It's incredible how close the director got to his subjects, and you can't believe some of the moments he's managed to catch on film. Finally, the film manages not just to tell these amazing, and sometimes troubling stories, but many of the scenes, and the film itself, functions as a metaphor for our contemporary world's layers of reality, encouraging us to contemplate ""what is real.""",1326758400,7,983,5.227848101265823

8492050,3,B0063HO5BE,This profiles people that are unsatisfied with their actual real lives and have created avatars of themselves in a Sims-like universe called Second Life on the internet. Occasionally interesting but for the most part sad. One couple does actually met in person. One guy spends all his time on it excising his demons. A woman has created a business within the experience. Surreal. Some swearing.,1466467200,,394,5.076923076923077
8492051,3,B0063HO5BE,"This movie touches on the division or lack of division between Second Life and Real Life (RL).  In my opinion the movie chose to accent the problems that can be caused by people making bad decisions in SL..and ruining their RL (real lives) to the exclusion of anything else in SL.
When I was in SL some years ago, I loved to explore. There are thousands of wonderful sims to explore, beauty you cannot imagine. You can 'visit' places in virtual other countries. This movie wasn't about that. It was about human feelings and the psychology of 'why you do what you do in a virtual world.'  All right, that may be important but there are people doing happy, inventive things in SL as well.
Second Life is a virtual world, also called a metaverse.  It was created as a platform, and people were invited to come there and make the world what they wanted.  People came and they created pretty much everything in this world..the beauty of a place where one can just go and be whomever you want to be.  Linden Labs created the platform and maintains it, and there is Linden money called Lindens which you buy with real money.  If you want. You can also create items wanted there and sell them or get an SL job. The world is free to join, and you can be there forever and never spend any real money..if you want.
There are games within it, and different groups you might want to join. There can be wars, and there can be love. There is religion, love, hate, laughter and tears, and role playing galore.
This movie focused on three situations where SL and RL got mixed up and people were badly hurt..in real life. The  movie seems to have been made in 2007, but the situations are much the same as they are now, except that now there are better avatars :)  I didn't like the long real life scenes where real people were hurt, real relationships lost.
What I wanted in this movie was a look around the beautiful places that people have created.  Perhaps the homes that people have created..to rent, sell and/or live in. The endless water that for the most part an avatar can swim, fish, boat etc. in.  There are Clubs of all kinds with great music. Music is a main theme in SL..everywhere you go..music.
Without context, the clubs and avatars shown looked foolish.
I am taking off one star for the movie concentrating on how a person can mess up his/her life by confusing SL and RL.  Thousands of people are in SL for totally different reasons, and can keep the two separate. Just being there is their reason, not to work out RL problems.
I am taking off one star for half of the movie actually taking place in real life.  I really didn't like that.
Maybe someone can make an SL movie showing the beauty of so many sims, the amazing Estates on which one can make a home.. and change their property to suit themselves.  Or show the merchants creating their wares. Builders building..artists creating virtual art...all of the wonders of SL.  They could show the wonderful events given for charity.
Conversely they could show a little of the debatably ugly parts of SL for the sake of honesty. Ugliness does exist.
I enjoyed the professionalism of the way the movie was made, but there is so much more to SL, I felt cheated that basically it was all about mistakes made and grief caused.
This movie is well made.  The music is very good.",1416096000,,3323,4.46039603960396
8492052,4,B0063HO5BE,"Rented and watched this DVD because I wanted to get an idea of what Second Life was about. I had seen an earlier documentary a couple years ago, but that one focused more on corporations setting up pavilions in Second Life to promote their brand (the company I work for had done that for awhile). I have to say I really wasn't expecting the amount of focus this new documentary takes on the four different SL users - nor the level of addiction one person has with the virtual world. But I could actually relate to that a bit - back in the days of the Usenet newsgroups there was a period of time when I spent hours participating in online discussions with people all over the globe. There is just something like that which can resonate with someone and make it irresistible.

I was really impressed with the woman that was running a business in Second Life, as someone who also creates digital content (as a hobby), I felt her frustration at having her work pirated and sold. I know several digital artists that have had that happen to. I was glad to learn she took legal action and was successful.

This was a pretty good documentary, one I'll probably be adding to my collection.",1411948800,,1181,4.462962962962963
8492053,3,B0063HO5BE,"When I first heard of the premise of this film,  I thought I was going to love it.  I tried Second Life a few years ago. As good as it is, there is something better (better in So Many ways) it is called Playstation Home (it's free to use on the Playstation 3 gaming console. Many people feel that Playstation Home is for ""gamers"" *it's not*.  The graphics on Second Life don't match up to PS Home.
  The movie in itself was ok. It was good to take a few selected people and expand on their virtual world experience(s). Anybody interested in a decent movie, check this out.  Anybody interested in a much better 'model' of a virtual world check out Playstation Home.",1405641600,,664,4.357723577235772
8492054,5,B0063HO5BE,"I had the pleasure of seeing this docu. in my college english class, we also watched SecondSkin. I have been an avid WoW player for 8 years and feel like I can either relate or understand the people in this film so well. The world of online gaming is so multi-faceted and this docu. does a fabulous job at giving a very important unbiased look at the lives of gamers. I love the people they chose and the stories they chose to share with us. It amazing because there is always going to be one thing that is 100% real in the virtual world and that is the emotion is brings. I've met someone online special, i've made friendships that will last the rest of my life, ive been in large guilds and raided new content until I wasn't really sure what day it was in ""real life"", and funny enough when I was younger my mom left the family (twice) for someone she met online in a video game as did Amie Goodie & Bluntly B. but just like Amie's daughter I still belong to virtual communities. I don't know what it is! I am 100% normal in real life and people are always shocked I play WoW... I can't say I have a ""second life"" but I will say I am a resident of the virtual world. :D I highly rec. this docu... sorry usually I don't get all personal in a review but this doc. was so touching because it hit so close to home. See you online! :p",1401408000,,1331,4.083969465648855
8492055,2,B0063HO5BE,"I watched this documentary today and was pretty disturbed by what I saw.  The reason I was so disturbed was because I actually downloaded and tried the game, Second life, and it was absolutely terrible, and honestly, the documentary is equally as terrible and disturbing as the game.  I gave it two stars because it was insightful, which I appreciate.  Anyhow, I admit that I am addicted to my computer, phone, PS3 etc.  I would know how to detach myself from the internet if I had to.  I played about 10-15 minutes of the game and gave up.  Bad graphics, way too involved, and just very weird.  Like I said, the documentary was equally as disturbing, and I was cringing throughout.  People being addicted to social media on this level is just sad.  People need to get out and live life, and this documentary made me want to get out the house even more after watching it.",1393459200,,871,4.496815286624204
8492056,4,B0063HO5BE,"Very good documentary; unfortunately it does nothing to dissuade those who think virtual worlds are peopled with adulterers and men posing as girls or women.

The film follows three storylines: A virtual couple who are both cheating on their spouses; a young man who 'roleplays' an eleven year old girl; and a woman who makes a living wage from her virtual products.

With the virtual couple, they decide to meet in real life, and things quickly go sour. Clearly, they both prefer the world of fantasy.

With the man pretending to be a little girl, he seems very emotionally troubled; and I don't mean his later revelation that he was abused as a child. I'm referring to his pushing aside his living breathing fiancee to spend time with his virtual friends. His best virtual friend is also a man pretending to be a little girl. I should point out that there is nothing sexual in their 'roleplay' although there was one scene in which the pretend children were all using 'cuddle animations' around a fire; that seems more appropriate for 'virtual grownups.' (It's very hard to find language to appropriately assess this type of world.) To me that seemed to be pushing the boundaries of appropriateness.

The 'little girl' decides to go on a 'suicide bombing mission' which I also found troubling. The grown man controlling that avatar says he wanted to be banned, so he would be forced to break his virtual-world addiction. Well, he only got suspended for a few days. The people who own Second Life (Linden Lab) are notorious for their laissez faire governmental philosophy.

That philosophy is explained a bit by the founder of Second Life, Philip Rosedale. He wanted to see what members/users or 'residents' as Linden Lab calls them, did with the world he 'created.' And a lot has changed since its early days (of which not much visual record exists) including Philip's own avatar. What began as a spiky haired simple set of polygons is now a realistic mockup of a 'live' human being. Similarly, Second Life has become somewhat of a virtual marketplace, as opposed to an actual world.

That's where the third story comes in: A woman lives in her parent's basement but actually makes more income than anyone else in her household. She sells virtual clothing, shoes, and fully furnished 'dream houses.' It's Barbie's dream come true in the world. The woman claims she brings in over $100,000 U.S. per year this way. Her brother, who also lives with their parents, grumbles as he goes out into the snowy morning for his own job. The woman in the documentary works in her pajamas, fueled by caffeine and cigarettes.

Unfortunately all is not well in pretend-land. The virtual couple breaks up once their dream world is shattered; their families likewise remained shattered by their mutual affair. The young man's relationship with his fiancee ends; he says he will create a new avatar, this time a male child. The businesswoman's products are stolen; she takes it to court. She wins, but the judgment is only $500 or so. Reportedly she later abandoned her business avatar, because it was retaliated against.

With so much wrong about the virtual world, what is left unanswered is: Why do people still return to it, even abandoning real life pursuits in its favor? Why does Linden Lab refuse to govern the place, other than extreme things (mainly things which affect their bottom line i.e. someone can't play, they can't pay their bills to Linden Lab.) We're left with more questions than we went in with, and meanwhile, viewers have more ammunition with which to demonize those who 'live' in virtual worlds.",1386460800,3,3604,4.848780487804878
8492057,4,B0063HO5BE,"Life 2.0 is a documentarian's look at the world of Second Life and those who are addicted to it.  There are three main story threads:  A man and a woman who decide to leave their families and be together after meeting online, a woman who lives at home and who makes her living from playing Second Life from 6pm until 11am, and a man who plays a little girl online (in theory, there are no adolescents online, as it's illegal for minors to play Second Life).  The documentary's structure makes it jarring viewing:  Real-life interviews are interspersed with footage from Second Life, so it's difficult sometimes to separate what's real and what's fake.  Certainly, for the individuals portrayed in this film, Second Life is far more real than their own real life.  As the film progresses, it becomes clear to what should have all been too obvious from the start:  that the people most addicted and absorbed by Second Life are exactly those who suffer from deep psychosis and seek an escape from the meaningless and trauma of their real lives.

And that's why there are now 15 million playing Second Life right this minute.",1380499200,2,1121,4.712820512820513
8492058,5,B0063HO5BE,"For those who have experienced Second Life know that it is not just a game. It somehow mixes real life and the virtual life. The movie was great and well done and it shows the different types of people behind the avatars, there are so many more.
I recommend the movie highly for anyone to see.",1379203200,3,293,4.25
