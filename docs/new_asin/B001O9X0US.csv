8330012,1,B001O9X0US,"I am not a fan of negative reviews, except when the product is this bad, I just had to prevent someone making my mistake.

The video is almost completely washed out, the colors are pale or nonexistent, and the audio is just a random vaudeville tune.  The entire video, about 8 chapters, is just clips taken from longer material.  I own one of the features that a clip is from, and I don't understand how the clip is so bad (no color, no original sound, etc.).  Just a super cheap production all together, from the content, to the DVD  and case art (ink jet, low DPI crap).

The content of this DVD wouldn't be so bad if it was from better source material (transfers), and if the price was far cheaper!  I returned mine to Amazon PDQ!",1405036800,8,733,4.306569343065694
8330013,5,B001O9X0US,"This is some good stuff were all kids at hart and I'm a sucker for a cartoon this is a classic package of vintage adult cartoon the quality it great the producers did a great job cleaning it up and adding good music that goes along with the program nicely.
Good stuff !!!",1286236800,5,271,4.132075471698113
