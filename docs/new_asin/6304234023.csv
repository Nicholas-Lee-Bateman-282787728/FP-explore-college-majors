7866654,5,6304234023,"This is one of my favorite workout tapes. What really makes this production ""Rock"" is the excellent coaching commentary that accompanies the invigorating music. This really brings the whole program full circle and gives the experience a personal feel that is quite rewarding. There are some great hills and beautiful vistas in this tape that really make you feel as though you are in Hawaii. There are also warm up and cool down segments that are very beneficial and an overall nice touch. Don't hesitate to treat yourself to this tour!",1350000000,,536,4.9010989010989015
7866655,4,6304234023,"this video is a good to guide you through a full spinning session from warmup to cooldown.  Sherman the narrator is on a bike but is not on screen most of the time.  He still does a nice job of moving you from sitting to a sitting climb to a standing climb and another standing climb and in his narration stresses proper positioning and breathing, all the things that a live spin instructor would do.  In addition you get to look at beautiful Hawaiian scenery in the process.  For someone like me who is currently saddled with a VHS-TV combo in front of my spin bike, the pickings for spinning videos is limited and this one is a good one",1329868800,,638,4.291666666666667
7866656,4,6304234023,"When I decided to bike indoors I bought 4 tapes thinking that I would be able to get a varied workout each day.  However, this is the only tape I use.  The scenery of Hawaii is beautiful and it is nice to be able to bike indoors while feeling as if you are outdoors.  It is also helpful to have the narrator telling you what to do and when to do it.  I wish I could find more tapes like this one.  This is sort of a beginning tape and now that I have been using it for a few months I am ready for the next step.  But all I can find are spinning tapes, which are awful, or other scenery tapes, which don't give you instructions about which gear to be in.  I would definitely recommend this tape for anyone who wants to continue biking in the winter.  I put my bike on a trainer and it works just great that way so you don't even need to buy an expensive stationary bike.",1015200000,8,869,3.9257142857142857
7866657,3,6304234023,"Although I have never attended a spinning class, I do ride a stationary bike at home.  This video is not the best instructional video I have seen, but it does have some great scenery.  The instruction is very low key, and the inset pictures of the instructor are helpful especially when the volume is low.  While not great, this video does give you a good workout and makes the 30 minutes go by a lot faster than watching the evening news!!  I have an inexpensive stationary bike and it works just fine for these excersizes.",1012521600,2,524,4.484210526315789
7866658,4,6304234023,"Awesome scenery, makes you want to go to Hawaii and ride. I have been using this tape for a month now, and still can't get through the entire ride the way they say to. I've noticed improved power and endurance using this video. It's sweat-o-rama time, if you give it a chance.",1007769600,,276,4.326923076923077
7866659,4,6304234023,This is a great work-out for anyone who loves biking at home.  I am ordering it again because I wore out my first copy!,961200000,12,119,3.9583333333333335
