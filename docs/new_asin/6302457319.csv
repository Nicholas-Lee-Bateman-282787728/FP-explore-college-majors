7826053,5,6302457319,"This Video is a must for any fanof Andre Watts.  This Feb. 20th 1985 performance, shows Mr. Watts' technical and interpretative gifts.  Starting with two Sonatas by early keyboard virtuoso Scarlatti, Watts takes the  listner on a journey through various periods in music.  His reading of  Beethoven's ""Moonlight"" Sonata was haunting.  His performance  also included Chopin , Gershwin, And Debussy.  Watts closed his concert  with Franz Liszt's Etude d'Transcendante, showing why he is the premier  interpreter of Liszt.  For his encore he played 2 etudes by Chopin which  included the famous ""Revolutionary""  etude. That  earned him a  much deserved standing ovation.  This video is a must for any fam of Andre  Watts.  He is truly one of the great pianist of our time.",964310400,10,769,5.1138211382113825
