Where I was expecting to see a lot of the city of Tokyo with it's neon lights and mass of shops. I felt the DVD was diluted with stills of cherry blossom trees, temples and Buddah statues. It's still not a bad background DVD to match with your music choice. The DVD nicely loops but I would of wished I had a selection of sections of the films. Like the lava lamp DVD where you can pick your color that loops an approximately 10min section. Then I could of just had the nightlife section loop, omitting the other video stills. Maybe there might be a Trippin On Tokyo 2 one day.",1373760000,,709,4.182481751824818
