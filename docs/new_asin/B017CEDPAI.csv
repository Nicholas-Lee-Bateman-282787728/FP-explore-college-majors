8738629,5,B017CEDPAI,"This a good movie. The pace is slower than an American movie but it is not  tedious or boring.

This Blu-Ray is a Universal Region -0-. There was no resetting the Region in my 3D laptop. Of course, I don't speak Icelandic or German.

I liked the movie. Iceland is truly amazing. There is nothing they don't have.",1484611200,,312,4.344827586206897
