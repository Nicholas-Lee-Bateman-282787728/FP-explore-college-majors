Some actors, who can be so, so co-o-o-ol know this and just roll with the punches and end up being, along with the film itself, very endearing. Trey Parker is such an actor, better known (as in ""Orgazmo"", among other movies and TV productions) than Ross Patterson, who plays the starring role in ""Strike: Balls of Glory"" (the edition viewed being Videoville Showtime, a.k.a. V.V.S. Films, cat. no. 1306). Both, as young men, at any rate, are nice-looking guys, even physically resembling each other to some extent, who rather just miss attaining the standard handsome-devil Hollywood male star look, but who still present a good image on the screen and who are loaded with comic skills and screwball charisma. Underlying all the antics, Ross Patterson, like Trey Parker also, can portray a character who is wonderfully human and sympathetic.

Trey Parker has targeted a part of his fun-making to do comic turns, as actor, screenwriter, producer, and/or director, on stage and in motion pictures, among other subjects of mirth, at Mormons and their missionaries. In ""Strike"", Ross Patterson, for his part, plays a L.A. slacker who has had aspirations (going nowhere) of being a film actor. Needless to say, he keeps hunger and destitution from his door by doing the usual slacker jo-jo jobs, like flogging mediocre pizza, making, selling, and fancifully delivering it.

What Ross Patterson REALLY excels at doing supremely well is his sports hobby, bowling! Really fantastically good bowling, that is to say (and no less than that), at local bowling allies is what he does with his best buddy, just for fun, after work hours and on weekends. Then he meets up with some professional bowling promoters who lure him into playing that sport, very quickly rising to ""pro"" status, on the professional bowling circuit in a big-time way that most of us hardly are aware exists.

Needless to say, when Ross realises just what his preferred game can pay him, he (with some persuasion from his girl friend and best friend and from the ""pros"" themselves) quickly rises to Bowling Glory, becoming the biggest star of ""bowling TV"" (and whoever would think that an all-bowling channel even would exist?). He affects some goofy mannerisms and dress, as ""Ross Vegas"" (his ""nom-de-quilles"", as it were), his girl becoming ""Li'l Reno"" (covering in their aliases, thus, both of Nevada's two major glitzy gambling shangri-las), with his best friend still tagging along as his agent (till another more powerful one takes over managing Ross' career completely but heartlessly). Ross Vegas' affected mannerisms draw all the more attention to what he achieves on the alleys' lanes.

Alas, success comes at the price (1) of a swelling ego and (2) of his personal life, until Ross suddenly comes to himself, drops out of the sports celebrity world, and he reclaims girlfriend and buddy alike. Having amassed so much wealth, Ross now can do what he pleases. What he likes is to help his girl and his friend to achieve their own goals and dreams. Very sweet. Touching, in fact (really meaning that, too!).

The film is low budget and none-too-polished, but in this kind of high camp, good vibes production, that just really is not so important. The film delivers a lot more in good times entertainment than its budget would seem to have promised. This is not flashy or sophisticated motion picture art, but ""Strike"" is a lot of fun to watch and very endearing.  This is one charming little cheapie which, especially in the rowdy company of some friends, merits and compels watching many times over.",1405814400,,3632,4.945901639344262
