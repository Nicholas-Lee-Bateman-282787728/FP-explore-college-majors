5722708,5,B00CI5PHKI,"A very good collection of movies. I like seeing the Italian take on westerns. The original Django is the best, but these movies are really good.",1390176000,,144,4.576923076923077
5722709,4,B00CI5PHKI,Overall....the whole discs are very clear to viewing via dvd machine and I also had purchase from previously the same type with most of the movies in the discs itself the same. But this one is the better one for me. The transfer is excellent and I would be glad to purchase the other collection as I remember some of the movies from way back growing up from overseas and we get to watch this film even if it is unrated or rated with no parents supervision in a regular theater.,1387238400,7,477,4.252747252747253
5722710,1,B00CI5PHKI,"The Django Collection Volume One: Six Film Set  westerns give spaghetti westerns a bad name.  These are nothing but silly cartoon like westerns without the animation.  Absurd is being kind in describing them.

The stories are terrible and it is clear whoever wrote this stuff knew nothing of the old west in the USA.

They rip off scenes and music from the Eastwood westerns, but with none of the quality in writing, acting or directing.  They are really bad.  The worst are the fights and the shootouts which look like children playing cowboys and Indians.

Save your money for something else.",1386892800,,594,4.811881188118812

5722746,3,B00CI5PHKI,"Read all the reviews and im a bit puzzled.has anyone ever done thorough research on spaghetti westerns or the myth that is Django and the so called sequels,as i don't think they exist.none of these movies contain the character whatsoever and all have made up titles to cash in on the name.germany seem to be doing the best job with spaghetti westerns at the moment and is the only place so far to have the fullest version of A Fistfull of Dollars",1409443200,2,446,4.451219512195122
5722747,5,B00CI5PHKI,the Django series is the best.  I am a die-hard Spaghetti Western fan and to find these DVD's on Amazon was great.  Plus I have never seen these movies before and I am very pleased.,1407542400,3,181,4.142857142857143

5722749,4,B00CI5PHKI,"I bought this a while back and enjoyed the films in it. This collection turned me into an Anthony Steffen fan, he's featured in a few of the films. I had owned a few Spaghetti Westerns before, but this set and another inexpensive set really exposed me to the genre. And these types of Westerns are some of my favorite films to watch, no they're not Kurosawa or Bergman films, but they have a certain charm to them that i really like, and they can be very entertaining.",1398988800,5,468,4.329545454545454
5722750,1,B00CI5PHKI,Bad quality of image!! I will never buy colletions of movies again! They try to compress many movies on 1 dvd with the result that you can not enjoy it anymore,1391558400,2,159,4.161290322580645
5722751,5,B00CI5PHKI,"...and it's a really good deal at a bargain price.

3 movies to each single-sided disc, no flippers here. All of the films are in very good to excellent condition, in widescreen and/or letterbox format.

A MAN CALLED DJANGO (1971) aka W DJANGO. This one looks great in widescreen with a sharp image and very good color. Anthony Steffen gives us one of his priceless Clint Eastwood impersonations as Django, a man seeking out the 3 outlaws who murdered his wife a year earlier. He teams up with Stelio Candelli, who gives us his best Eli Wallach/Tuco impersonation (it's a good one!), and the both of them track down the killers and run guns on the side. They even pull the famous ""turn 'em in for the reward money"" scam just like in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY! You just can't help not to love the audacity. The Piero Umiliano soundtrack is catchy, but being a later entry into the genre the comic element a la TRINITY is present, however the high body count more than compensates for that. I feel that this movie alone is worth the price of purchasing the set. TIMELESS MEDIA also offers this on a widescreen double feature along with DJANGO AND SARTANA'S SHOWDOWN IN THE WEST.

DJANGO THE RUNNER (1966) aka THE BRUTE AND THE BEAST is probably best known as MASSACRE TIME, directed by horror master Lucio Fulci and probably the best film offered on this set. Franco Nero and George Hilton are in top form as the two antagonistic brothers who team up to defeat the evil town boss. Hilton steals every scene he's in, and Nino Castelnuovo is excellent as the over-the-top psycho son of town boss Giuseppe Addobbati. While this version is letterboxed and is quite acceptable, WILD EAST PRODUCTIONS offers a much better anamorphic widescreen version listed as THE BRUTE AND THE BEAST.

HANGING FOR DJANGO (1969) aka NO ROOM TO DIE. This is also letterboxed with a very nice print, exceptional picture quality. In this one Eastwood clone Anthony Steffen, a stoic man of few words, teams up with preacher(?) William Berger to mete out Spaghetti justice. Berger excels in off-beat roles (Banjo in SABATA, Siringo in FACE TO FACE) and this is one of his best, making this must-see viewing for Spaghetti Western fans. Though I don't have it, RARO films has recently released this one in anamorphic widescreen as HANGING FOR DJANGO.

Disc 2 starts off with DJANGO: A BULLET FOR YOU (1966) which would be Leon Klimovsky's FEW DOLLARS FOR DJANGO had he directed it, though he gets credit due to a distribution issue. The real director is Enzo Castellari (of the original INGLORIOUS BASTARDS fame) and it's a pretty good early ride down the Django trail, complete with a pulsing Carlo Savina score. Anthony Steffen again appears as Clint Eastwood and in many scenes the resemblance is quite remarkable. It is said that Eastwood modeled his HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER after a Steffen film, STRANGER'S GUNDOWN aka DJANGO THE BASTARD. If so, then it's a classic case of Eastwood imitating Steffen imitating Eastwood! In this one Steffen is on the trail of Frank Wolf who may or may not be a twin brother wanted for bounty, depending upon which brother is really dead. The widescreen print looks as though it were filmed yesterday not nearly fifty years ago, though the dubbing appears a little off in this one. Scenes from the finale, when the bad guys attack the ranch to kill the farmers and blow things up was lifted for the opening sequences of Castellari's later PAYMENT IN BLOOD (1967) aka SEVEN WINCHISTERS FOR A MASSACRE. Even the Confederate cap shows up as well, and also again in Castellari's KEOMA (1976).

RETURN OF DJANGO (1967) aka SON OF DJANGO aka VENGENCE IS A COLT .45 is a good-looking letterboxed print which opens like DEATH RIDES A HORSE in which Django the father is mysteriously killed at night in his cabin as witnessed by a child that grows up to become SON OF...well, you get it and know where it's going from here. Osvaldo Civirani directs and there's a nice Piero Umiliani score. Guy Madison and Gabriele Tinti star and WILD EAST PRODUCTIONS offers an anamorphic widescreen version as VENGENCE IS A COLT .45 though the source print may be the same. Credits for both are in Italian, and the title appears to read as SON OF DJANGO.

A PISTOL FOR DJANGO (1971) aka EVEN DJANGO HAS HIS PRICE aka DJANGO'S CUT PRICE CORPSES is another excellent widescreen print, making this a set without a really bad pan 'n scan movie in it. Here Jeff Cameron is a pretty clean cut Django, no stubble at all! He's out to get the bank robbing Cortez brothers, one of which is really a girl, who all like to dress up in the same outfits for some unknown family fetish. They like to torture and shoot people too. The catchy Vasili Kojucharen score helps to make this a pleasant ride. Pretty high body count but low on bloodshed. TIMELESS MEDIA offers this on a widescreen double bill along with DJANGO KILLS SILENTLY.

So all said and done, I'm MANY TIMES pleased with this purchase which offers 6 Django films on 2 single-sided discs, a few harder to find ones to boot. And they all look pretty good, several quite astonishingly good. I consider this an excellent buy and will now purchase vol. 2.",1390348800,23,5185,4.652838427947598
