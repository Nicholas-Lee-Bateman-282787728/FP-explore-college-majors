8668772,2,B00LXDQ8GI,"A breakdancing fight club, you ask? How can you go wrong with such a solid premise? This is how you go wrong...Battle B-Boy. 90+ minutes of some porn-bad acting, interspersed with some pretty bad fight scenes. If you're hanging out with a group of people, this movie might make a fun group event, if your group is into watching not great movies and laughing at them, but that's about it.",1418688000,,387,4.542857142857143
