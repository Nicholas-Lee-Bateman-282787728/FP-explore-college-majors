8438771,5,B004R9Q2DO,"I had hoped that there, would of been @ least 2 more love scenes between lisbeth, & her co-star, that, ran the paper, I think that, the last 2 love scenes, the first love scene when she first came back, from being gone so long, in the second movie, & again in the last movie. I was bumbed out that, lisbeth & her costar didn't get two more love scenes, that, was a good pairing.",1416268800,,378,4.053333333333334

8438773,5,B004R9Q2DO,"I had the fist DVD, however ordered the trilogy just to see what happens to the Character. Re-viewed the first part, started the 2nd DVD and couldn't stop till I watched the 3rd DVD. So much better than the American version with Daniel Craig. Some scenes hard to watch but supported the growth of the Character. Highly recommend if you like a thriller or Books of this type.",1412467200,6,374,4.514705882352941
