8137579,1,B000H8BMI4,"This may be my fault, but I was looking for an animated film that my 5-year old grandson could watch. We had a pleasant experience with him and the Claymation films, and so we were looking for more of the same. Unfortunately, when we reviewed this film, we almost immediately knew that this was not a film for someone as young as he is. I'll take the blame for that, but this series is definitely not for a 5-year old. Sorry.

8137580,5,B000H8BMI4,"I am so glad they decided not to end the ""Animated Stories from the New Testament"" series with ""The Ministry of Paul"". These newer animated movies about the Savior that are coming out these days are just as good as the old ones, and in some ways, they're even better.

Anyway, I simply adore ""Jesus, the Son of God"". It's very interesting to see Jesus as a child with his earthly parents, and to see what happens to him as he first starts out on his ministry after his baptism by John the Baptist. It's especially fascinating to see how he is able to successfully stand his ground against Satan, even when he's weak and exhausted.

The animation is great, the music is absolutely superb, and the acting is brilliant. It's like you're really there with the characters. Jesus is by far the very best character of all. Ivan Crossland deserves a special award for his magnificent portrayal as our beloved Lord and Savior.",1201564800,10,917,4.585365853658536
