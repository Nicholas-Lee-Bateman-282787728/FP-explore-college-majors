8298291,1,B001EI3UNG,"The run time of less than two hours tells the story. Zeffirelli destroys the musical and dramatic continuity by making arbitrary cuts throughout the opera, some of them at high points (a large chunk of the ""Si pel ciel"" duet is missing). There are other videos of this opera starring Domingo, all of them much better than this one.",1454025600,,331,4.627118644067797
8298292,5,B001EI3UNG,"I have always loved this version (Zefferelli, Domingo) of Otello.
ONe warning- it only comes as area 2 (PAL) so if you do not have a universal player it won't work.",1362700800,2,164,4.32258064516129
8298293,1,B001EI3UNG,"Zaffirelli's concept is stupid and disrespectful to this majestic opera. He is forcing his 'vision' on to the audience, before the music. By the way he eliminated the willow song on the third act.",1361059200,,196,4.794117647058823
