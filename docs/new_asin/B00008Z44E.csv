1872562,5,B00008Z44E,"this film, like many other great classics, been forgotten or so it seems. i have always cherished this little gem. it was directed by William Wyler, a man whose name is synonymous with great filmmaking. though this film may pale in comparison to the epic ""Ben Hur"" it should by no means be disregarded.
the basic premise is a band of criminals ""on the lam"" from the police decide to converge upon a midwestern family and use their home as a refuge from the authorities. Humphrey Bogart gives one of the best performances of his career, reviving the old gangster type roles which propelled him to stardom in the 1930s. to divulge any of the plot elements would be unfair to anyone considering the viewing or purchase of this great little gem of a film. it seizes your attention from the beginning with its ominous score to the last riveting scene and never lets go.
as for the DVD, the picture clarity is amazingly sharp and the sound is good too. as for the special features, there are none. this was very disappointing. this one really deserved the special treatment. in spite of its lack of special features, the clarity and sound are enough to warrant a closer look at this wonderful little film.",1057449600,6,1199,4.607476635514018
1872563,4,B00008Z44E,"William Wyler directs Humphrey Bogart in the super tense thriller THE DESPERATE HOURS.  Three on the lam thugs invade a heartland American home and hold a family hostage. Everyone seeks survival and an ordinary dad (Frederick March) puts his life on the line for his family. Bogie at his very best as a snarling, deadly con.  Heartstopping showdown.  Unforgettable climax. You'll hold your breath and bite your nails.  This is one to own.  See what great filmmaking and storytelling is all about.
Don't confuse this with the pallid 1990 remake starring Mickey Rourke, directed by Michael Cimino.",1056585600,3,595,5.092783505154639
1872564,5,B00008Z44E,"I have been a Bogart fan all my life. He was that rare Hollywood breed so seldom seen today - and actor AND a movie star. In this ""little"" movie, Bogart and March lock wills - each knowing that the other is dangerous and desperate, each knowing that they both have more than their own lives to lose. They take the conflict to the edge, their hands, virtually at each other's throats in nearly every scene and then find a way to back off to live another day or another hour. In the quiet moments, March stares away from the camera several times, effectively showing the ""wheels turning,"" an action not lost on Bogart. When he catches him at it he says ""click-ity, click-ity"" and warns him not to try anything. Advice, you know he'll never heed. This movie may not appeal to viewers who have grown up watching shoot-em-ups but movie fans and fans of good acting will find plenty to hold their attention.  A few of the bit players, especially the cops, are saddled with hokey 1950's dialog but you'll get over it. The ending is all you could ask for. I suggest you give it a shot.",1043366400,42,1077,4.385
1872565,5,B00008Z44E,"If I remember correctly ""The Desperate Hours"" was originally a stage play that was based on a true story.  A photo-magazine ran a spread on either the play or the film with pictures of the ""real"" house and the family sued for invasion of privacy; one of their lawyers was Richard Nixon.  Humphrey Bogart gets top-billing in ""The Desperate Hours"" as gangster on the lam Glenn Griffin, but this is really Frederic March's film.  March plays businessman Dan Hilliard, who discovers his home has been invaded and his family taken hostage by Griffin's little band of criminals, which includes his kid brother Hal (Dewey Martin) and the brutish Sam Kobish (Robert Middleton).  That morning Hilliard's biggest concerns had been Chuck Wright (Gig Young), the boyfriend of his daughter Cindy (Mary Murphy), the refusal of young son Ralphie (Richard Eyer) to kiss his old man goodbye, and what wife Eleanor (Martha Scott) is going to make for dinner.  Now he has to find a way to keep his family alive in a world where the police are perfectly willing to gun down unarmed criminals so their ability to protect an innocent family is certainly suspect.

This is a taunt drama, carried mostly by the desperation of March's character, who fails every time he tries to prove himself the hero.  Bogart's performance is notable because it is a return to the tough guy role that made him a star, only this time showing more restraint than we had seen two decades earlier.  This 1955 film also stands as a testament to how much things have changed in Hollywood, because they would never allow for this clean of an ending to this situation, a point that would be obvious even without the horrible remake of this film with Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins, which gives into the perceived need for sadistic violence.

Ultimately what makes this film work is that the climax exceeds our expectations given the set-up.  You have to admire how a man can walk into a house with an unloaded gun and save the day.  The final confrontation between Hilliard and Griffin is powerful because it speaks to not only the fact that you can hurt somebody without killing them, but also that even when confronted with barbarians there is still virtue in being a civilized man.  I still watch the ending of this film every time I stumble across it on television.  In fact, I just did.",1021680000,28,2346,4.720588235294118
1872566,5,B00008Z44E,Humphrey Bogard was great at playing private detictives like in maltese falcon and Desperate Hours shows that he can play the opposite of a private decective- a criminal.

1872568,5,B00008Z44E,"Now this is a great flick. No one played the hard-edged bad guy like Bogie. This flick is old schol, meaning the story depends on the acting and not special effects or overused violence.
Bogart, his brother, and a simple minded convict escape prison and hold up in a suberbian 'Beaver-Cleaver' household. They have to hideout there until Bogie gets some dough from his girlfriend. The confrontations between the family and the convicts keep this movie going fluently without a break in drama, suspense, or action.

Bogart, his brother  and another convict have escaped from prison.  They find a nice house in a  nice neighborhood and decide to drop in for a visit.  Holding the four  family members hostage until Bogart's girlfriend arrives is not as easy as  they first figured.  Some very good moments, especially between Bogart and  Fredric March.

1872570,4,B00008Z44E,"The Desperate Hours is a very suspenseful tale of a family that is held hostage in their own home by three escaped convicts.  The story is fascinating to watch because they must adapt to having these strangers in  their home, and in some cases, they most go on about their lives and go out  in public without telling anyone what is happening at home.  It seems  unrealistic that it could happen that way, but it makes sense in the movie.  As usual, director William Wyler gets top performances from his cast.  Fredric March is terrific as the father who feels frustrated and helpless  that he is unable to free his family from the terrorizing of the convicts.  Martha Scott does well as his wife.  Humphrey Bogart, as the leader of the  convicts, gives the good performance that you expect from him, and the rest  of the cast is good, too.  (If I'm not mistaken, the actor playing Kobish,  one of the  convicts, went on to be the voice of Fred Flintstone.)  The  Desperate Hours presents a story that will keep you in suspense, and it  shows how people can find the courage to protect those they love.",951350400,,1101,4.50253807106599

Patriarch Fredric March is just as tough,determined as the thugs invading his home. this is one of my favorite Bogart films and after years or playing the reluctant hero, is at his best as a convicted murderer who won't hesitate to kill March,his wife or two children. taut and tense the movie is shot in magnificent black and white. my only regret is that Bogey's career and life are nearing the end. as an unabashed fan, one cannot help but wonder what films he may have made if he had lived longer. yet it does make you savor one of his very best bad guy roles. way better than the modern 'remake'.

1872703,5,B00008Z44E,"Humphrey Bogart's SANTANA Productions tried securing rights to the original stageplay of THE DESPERATE HOURS but were outbid by Bill Wyler, who in 1955 ended up directing Bogie, Fredric March, Arthur Kennedy, Martha Scott, Dewey Martin, Gig Young, Robert Middleton, Alan Reed, Ray Collins and Whiut Bissell in the screen version.

Spencer Tracy was asked to play Dan Hilliard and he wanted to, but was unavailable.
It's often said he didn't participate because of a billing dsipute with Bogart, but this isn't true.
Bogie didn't care who got first mention.

These were in a sense ""desperate hours"" for Bogart. His health was failing, he'd invested 400K in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BEAT-THE-DEVIL/dp/B00005A0QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BEAT THE DEVIL</a>&nbsp;(1953) and barely broke even, his SANTANA was unable to either develop new talent or secure worthwhile properties, and he had finally asked out of a 15 year contract with WARNER BROS. Jack L. hated Bogie and made sure the actor never again set foot on WARNER property, even though publicly the actor declared the parting was amicable and that he was open to doing another WB film.

It was around the time that ""Desperate Hours"" was in production that SANTANA was sold to COLUMBIA for $1 million. To Bogart the post-tax 750K was an insurance policy for wife Lauren Bacall and their two young children.

In this fine crime drama, Bogart reprises every major criminal he'd played since the 1930s. Escaped killer Glenn Griffin would be Bogie's final bad guy part and it's one of his best.

Griffin, his brother Hal (Martin) and big dumb Sam Kobish (Middleton) have escaped from prison and head to Indianapolis, where they take a family hostage and await delivery of some getaway cash. Their stay at the Hilliard family home is not without serious complications....

BTW, if the exterior of that house looks familiar, it's probably because from 1957,

1872722,4,B00008Z44E,"Paul Newman was considered for this role, but Bogie was a bigger star so he got the nod.  And that's unfortunate because he looks miscast in this home invasion feature drama.  After all, 56 year olds have usually been promoted to lead crime syndicates (if they're still alive) and leave climbing through kitchen windows to the young Turks.  Paul Newman on the other hand, was 30 when the picture was made and would have been the perfect fit.

Bogart reprises the role of Duke Mantee he first conceived back in 1936 in The Petrified Forest; there is even a Bogart crack ""Duke Mantee grown up,""  and one can't help wondering why Bogie would want to hang around that kind of role considering what he achieved afterward.

So it's really Frederic March's picture, his performance is taut and tight lipped - be secure in the knowledge you're getting a first rank effort from March, with Bogie of secondary interest leading a band of wastrels that include Robert Middleton giving a suitably greasy performance as a psychopathic marauder.  Martha Scott and Mary Murphy give convincing performances as wife and daughter to the Frederic March character conflicted in how to proceed when Bogart's band of conscripts hold him and his family hostage.  The photography is outstanding, and there are cuts that appropriately leave to the imagination what tractor trailers can do to the human body although William Wyler gets credit for even thinking to position cameras along these lines.",1388102400,2,1472,4.955284552845528

1872738,4,B00008Z44E,"The Desperate Hours(released Oct/55)stars,among others,Humphrey Bogart as Glenn Griffin,Fredric March as Daniel C. Hilliard,Arthur Kennedy as Deputy Sheriff Jesse Bard,Martha Scott as Eleanor Hilliard,Dewey Martin as Hal Griffin and Gig Young as Chuck Wright. Veteran director William Wyler is at the helm of this mid 50s thriller,with the pairing for the first and only time of thesps Bogie and Fredric March. It is the Petrified Forest meets suburbia. While Petrified had enough eccentricity in its characters and plot to keep you glued to your seat,this one doesn't have near the same dynamic at all. Wyler's direction is good and all actors apprise themselves with surprising hutzpah,but I was expecting a little more tension and twists. It's not bad,it's just could have been much better.
The story finds Bogie as one half of the Griffin brothers,along with an overgrown child/convict as their tag along. They have just broken jail and are looking for some place to crash until they're able to get out of town and slip through a dragnet the police have thrown up in the area. The police know they're somewhere nearby but they don't,as the film opens,know exactly. We are introduced,next,to the Hilliard family,with March as the head of the household,who has a wife,a teenage daughter and a young son. It's Father Knows Best,typical suburbia of the 50s time. Bogie and his entourage of course pick the Hilliard home as their hide out when everyone but Mrs. Hilliard is out.
One by one each member of the household make their way back home throughout the day the day to find their new guests. Bogie of course has to get tough not only with the Hilliards,but his accomplices also,who both balk at their having to stay so long. After a few confrontations and close calls,the family tries as they might to act normally to the outside world,but the longer it goes on the more""cracks"" appear in the veneer. Eventually Bogie gets in contact with his girlfriend,who agrees to come a fair distance to deliver some money. However she is caught by the cops for running a light in a small town and never makes it.
No longer able to act normal,with things getting so desperate,Mr. Hilliard finally sends a note to the police. The police cotton on to his problems after a while and show up just as he is returning with the cash Griffin wanted;sent in the mail. The police at first refuse to let Mr Hilliard return home,but an FBI agent on scene over rules everyone and allows him to go back. Hilliard takes a revolver with him,but with no bullets. Griffin has threatened to kill family members if the police show up,and it is a tense moment for Mr. Hilliard as he re enters his home. Hilliard distracts/tricks one accomplice,who wanders outside only to be picked off by the police. Griffin hears the commotion and takes Hilliard's son as hostage. But Griffin has the gun without the bullets and Hilliard tells his son to run. He gets the drop on Griffin and Griffin is forced to go outside,where he too is gunned down. The film fades to black as the family finally reunite...all safe.
I found there were a little too many moments where any one of the Hilliards could have blown the whistle during their normal routines. As it turns out in the end,Mr. Hilliard did just that and everything turned out all right anyways. Of course there wouldn't have been a movie would there?Then there is the teacher who comes a calling on her pupil to see if he is alright. Mr. Hilliard comes home with one of the accomplices who,when he sees the teacher,makes a sudden turn and walks back out. Then March pretends the man is someone whom he met at a bar. Then just as the teacher,uncomfortably,starts to leave with a notebook of Hilliard's son,Mr. Hilliard takes it from her. He reads inside the notebook only to discover a note his wife has scrawled to her asking for help. The teacher,now even more confused,leaves. It's a very awkwardly played scene and it didn't ring true. Then there is the continual coming in and out of the teenage Hilliard's boyfriend. He eventually becomes a real pest as far as the plot goes,which we could have done without. One moment I did find quite good,was the one where the trash collector is being taken for a ride out to the boonies. As they come down the final road where he knows certain death awaits,you can see the absolute terror,confusion and desperation in his face.
By the way the teacher is none other than Beverley Garland,in an uncredited role. Watch for the man who Griffin's brother gets a ride with when he leaves. It is Joe Flynn,also in an uncredited role. You may better know him as Capt. Binghamton of McHales Navy. The Hilliard son is none other than Richard Eyer,who was quite the good little actor. You will better know him from the 7th Voyage of Sinbad as the Genie of the lamp. And oh yes,Alan Reed,the voice of the future Fred Flintstone,is one of the detectives...see if you can spot him.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1. This print does how some wear,especially in the first reel,but gets better as it goes along. Generally though it is clear and crisp. There are no extras in this B&W film.
All in all this is a film which should have been better than it was. The film relies too heavily on Bogie's menace of the Petrified Forest vein,but the plot holes work against much of the film and weaken it. As I said it is not a bad movie,just one that should have been better,considering the talent on hand. 3 1/2 stars.",1375401600,,5486,4.691908713692946

Clearly, this movie was made in a different era - Humphrey Bogart & Frederic March play out a scenario where three escaped convicts take up residence in the house of a typical family - Mom, Dad, teenage daughter and little kid (boy named Ralphie). In the 1950's, it was unthinkable for major stars to appear in a movie where the bad guys would stay over night (actually) I think it was two, without taking advantage of the, well, female distractions. I mean, they let the daughter go to school but with a firm warning ""Tell anyone we are here and mommy get's one between the eyes....get it?

Today, I fear mother and daughter would be raped, son would be forced to watch, etc.,  Then again, today's films push the limits on fronts like these.

The family whose house he invades includes the usual middle-class father and mother and teenage daughter and spunky little son. I think you will recognize the son. They are held hostage, but this is no simple story by any means. You will probably not be able to predict the outcome in detail, although in the 1950s, you know, they did not make movies where the criminals won.

Bogart plays a villain almost better than he does a hero; the beard stubble and rough ways which the prison has given him fit the Bogart face very well.

The only frustration with the movie is that one of the cops has a particular history with Bogart's character which is never explained. Another cop asks him, ""Is he the one who . . .?"" and the cop answers, ""Yes, he's the one."" That's all we ever find out, except that Bogart apparently knows the cop's name when he calls it out.

March is just as good as the husband and father, steady and protective of his family who match wits with their captors. Most of the picture takes place in the the family home which gives the film a stagelike quality but the fine cast of Martha Scott, Mary Murphy and Richard Eyer lend realism to a tense and satisfying movie.

1872768,4,B00008Z44E,"In 1936 a then lesser known actor named Humphrey Bogart appeared as a gangster for the first time in the classic film The Petrified Forest which included screen legends Bette Davis and Leslie Howard. The plot was simple, a notorious gangster. Duke Mantee (Bogart), holds people hostage in a service station in the middle of nowhere awaiting his girlfriend. What made The Petrified Forest so great is it's handling of multiple ideas; Patriotism, freedom, art, philosophy, and the pursuit of your dreams no matter what they are. Most films can't handle more one or two ideas without falling apart and Forest managed to handle more than that and succeeds; Truly a timeless film.

Fast forward to 1955 and Bogey, now a screen legend, stars in his penultimate film, The Desperate Hours. Basically, a rip-off of The Petrified Forest with some minor differences.  Instead of an assembly of interesting characters being held hostage, or ones with backgrounds contributing to a important themes, we get a standard suburban family. This was a strictly A-to-B plot, gangsters hold the family hostage, they sweat it out with some events occurring and all the bad guys are gunned down at the end. Fredrick March plays the father of the family being held hostage and though he gives a good preformance, you never feel much for him. I will admit there is some suspense and actually enough to sustain the film but it's ultimately formulaic; A shame since more could have been explored with this material. A couple of times Bogart exposes why he hates March so much: He hates the upper class, the ones on the parole board that said he can't live with ""decent folk"". If only the writers took advantage of this friction. Also another good idea that was wasted was Bogart's relationship towards his younger brother who looked up to him. I never read the play or book this film was based on but chances are it could have more psychological depth then the film. The trend in Hollywood by the 1950's was to make gangsters more one-dimensional then they used to be portrayed in the 1930's. Both Eddie G. Robinson and Jimmy Cagney were playing gangsters at the time who totally lacked humanity.

Overall, I'd say Desperate Hours, despite it's formulaic nature, holds up today. If you want fun distraction, pick it up.",1273190400,,2292,4.841836734693878

All acting is superb, though a bit of overkill with the 2 hysterical women captors. The child actor is a marvelous spunky character who never rose to deserved fame as did other kid actors.

As one reviewer wrote, What indeed would we do in this same situation, where Bogart & his 2 prison cronies hold a suburban family hostage.

(USA - 1955 - black and white)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1 (VistaVision)
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

The patriarch of a middle-class suburban family (Fredric March) is forced to take action when they're held hostage in their own home by three escaped convicts, one of whom (Humphrey Bogart) is an experienced lifer with nothing to lose...

The first and only pairing of superstars Bogart and March is a tightly-wound thriller, written by Joseph Hayes (based on his novel and stageplay, inspired by actual events), and directed by Hollywood veteran William Wyler, distancing himself from the 'women's pictures' he had helped to popularize during the 1940's (THE LITTLE FOXES, MRS. MINIVER, THE HEIRESS etc.). Photographed in gleaming deep-focus VistaVision by Lee Garmes (SCARFACE, THE PARADINE CASE), the movie wrings incredible tension from the claustrophobic settings and frequent stand-offs between staunch family man March and embittered con Bogart. The movie's themes are fairly conservative and the outcome is never really in doubt, but this is a top-drawer thriller from Hollywood's 'golden age'. Also starring Arthur Kennedy, Martha Scott, Dewey Martin and Gig Young in crucial supporting roles. Unmissable.

NB. Though nowhere near as dreadful as most critics would have you believe, Michael Cimino's remake DESPERATE HOURS (1990) isn't a patch on the original.",1062633600,15,1386,5.549763033175355
