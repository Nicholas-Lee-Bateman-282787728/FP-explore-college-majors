8055645,3,B0008DB79C,"I didn't watch the entire episode, so will give it a conditional three stars.  However, listening to heartfelt testimony by decent, intelligent veterans, who credited the Anthem for providing them with inspiration in battle, I couldn't help but think, after 72 years of living experience, serving in the military, and witnessing multiple US war fiascos abroad...

""A documentary on the Star Spangled Banner, and testimony by surviving veterans, reminded me of so many ,who, like Pavlov's dogs, after a lifetime of careful conditioning by their masters, will, without really understanding why, charge into a hail of bullets with the sound of music in their heads.""

8055646,4,B0008DB79C,"A decent documentary ruined by background music that is far too loud and overwhelms the commentary and interviews. I am assuing the period music is representative of tunes that may have been selected as our national anthem. In essence, who ever mixed the audio for this, otherwise interesting, documentary should have been strung-up the flagpole.",1435881600,,346,5.3090909090909095
