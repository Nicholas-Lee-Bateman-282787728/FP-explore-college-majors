8347909,3,B001Y44F7K,"Ah, the good old days.  Again.  Only this time it involves resurrecting Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo).  Oh wait, wasn't that the first movie.  It gets confusing, so many scenes are so familiar.  The domino effect, the face wave, the book, the same mummy soldiers.  Was this a sequel or a remake of the first film?  Whats new?  There is a son the OConnells shamefully neglect, too busy smooching at every opportunity.  When they're not exchanging jokes about mummies, mummies everywhere.  Pygmy mummies, a gag that doesnt quite pay off.  And thats the problem, they waste so much time trying desperately to be funny that when someone actually dies you're still waiting for the punch line.  In the eight years it took them to produce a kid and to discover that one of them suddenly has a tattoo that wasn't there before, you realize they didn't learn a darn thing from the first adventure.  They are still rash, still able to avoid bullets, and whatever happened to Evies spectacles that she so desperately needed at the beginning of the first movie?  This movie has a lot of special effects, several villains too many, and a lot less fun.  I expected better.",1517011200,,1151,4.71356783919598
