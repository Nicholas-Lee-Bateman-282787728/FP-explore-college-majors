The rest are still great and it's still a great tape to watch. I give this tape a 7 out of 10.,1282521600,,262,3.8703703703703702
451486,2,630231402X,"Warning: spoilers
Let's start with the good: First off the cast of the movie is great- I really don't think they could have done much better as far as casting, all of the actors performances where spot on. My favorite parts of the movie were the flashbacks of the romance between Aaron Johnson and Carey Mulligan. I thought they completely captured the feeling of teenage love and the excitement and nervousness that goes along with it.
Now onto the bad: There were a few things about the movie that bothered me. First, while the majority of the movie was slow going, the ending was super rushed. While the ending was supposed to be sweet and all tied together in a nice neat package I found it unbelievable and corny.  Also unbelievable was that the son Bennet, who was prom king and voted most liked, never had a girlfriend in high school. How many guys did you know in high school who were prom king yet also single? Answer: none. Oh and the fact that Carey Mulligans's character graduated from high school, got asked out by her crush of more than 4 year, lost her virginity, subsequently got pregnant, and finally got in a car accident that ended up killing her new boyfriend, all in the same day. Really? I would have found it much more believable if they had spread those series of events out over at least a couple of months rather than have it occur over the span of one day.
Anyway is the movie worth watching? Yes, if you are desperately bored and can watch it free on Netflix. But if you are looking for a good movie on a Saturday night I say skip it- there are plenty of better movies.",1279238400,,1597,4.4135593220338984
451487,3,630231402X,"""The Greatest"" stars Pierce Brosnan and Susan Sarandon as Allen and Grace Brewer, a grief-stricken couple whose family has been pushed to the breaking point by the accidental death of their eldest son, Bennett.  When a young woman, Rose (Carey Mulligan, ""An Education""), shows up a few months later announcing that she's pregnant with Bennett's child, the Brewers are forced to explore the depths of their empathy.  Both Brosnan and Sarandon turn in believable performances.  Brosnan in particular is really strong here.  I've never seen him so open and so emotional before.

The problem is the portrayal of Bennett, whom we see only briefly before the accident that takes his life.  More a metaphor for all that is good with untapped, unlimited potential, he never comes off as an actual flesh-and-blood individual.  Since the accident is largely his responsibility, it's tough to get on board with his parents' grief.  There are also some jarring moments when dialogue or actions seem really off and undermine the tone of the movie.

Movies about grieving are tough sells.  On the surface, they are depressing and put off many people.  It's the handling of the theme that determines whether audiences will embrace such a movie.  Think ""Ordinary People:""  solid script, superb direction, first-rate performances.  ""The Greatest"" falls far short of that high standard.  Bonus extras include interviews with the director, Pierce Brosnan and Carey Mulligan, and deleted scenes.",1278892800,9,1475,5.243589743589744
451488,5,630231402X,"This movie is intense, portraying a jagged, yet purifying emotional journey involving a sudden, brutal car accident, resulting in the death of favored son (Bennett), cameo role for Aaron Johnson. The shocking, unexplainable loss is complicated by the unexpected pregnancy of Bennett's true love, (Rose) with a stunning performance by Carey Mulligan. Rose and Bennnett's unspoken love is finally consumated, by these perfectly matched quiet, soulful characters...explosively mangled by devastation, jolting all the intimate characters into a dysfunctional, rag tag family. Rose has no where to go and ends up with Grace, Allen, and the younger, troubled brother (Ryan) Johnny Simmons. Everyone has their individual and collective demons, unhealthy diversions, and another unavoidable collision course with truth and acceptance.

The chemistry is exceptional, Pierce Brosnan (suppressed father Allen) is prodigious in his role of steadily degrading stoicism. Susan Sarandon (bereaved mother Grace) does insanity and loss with unrivaled panache. The two sons display perfection and realism, but the real star of this amazing drama is the newcomer, Carey Mulligan as ""Rose."" The viewer is captivated by her elfin beauty, desperate hopes, appealingly powerful, and delicate presence.

This family's drama echoes hauntingly dramatic, yet familiar tones. It is so well put together, that it just pierces you directly in the heart, like a syringe of adrenaline... where you find yourself gasping in the powerful breath of life emerging once again. Director Shana Feste is absolutely extraordinary, as I understand this movie was made in an unbelievably short window of time---signifying perfection in each scene and continual movement forward. A feat in itself, but even more satisfying is the story told and the potential awards it deserves.

It is NOT a blockbuster (in the sense of cost and marketing), but comes across as one, with exposed emotions, human frailty, vulnerabilities and the undeniable forces of love and spirit. All the characters find themselves in the same lifeboat of grief, paddling in different directions and eventually finding that its okay to just drift together and hold on...to each other...

A fantastic story and nobody could have done this better...Thumbs way up!",1278374400,3,2287,5.563218390804598
451489,2,630231402X,"Directed by Shana Feste, the film tells the story of a family trying to come to terms with the sudden death of their son in a car accident. The process of living though such a horrific event is made even more intense by the sudden announcement by the girl who was in the car with the son on the night he died that she is pregnant with his child.

It sounds almost too melodramatic to be anything but the plot of a bad afternoon soap opera, but Feste, who wrote the script, does her best to try and steer clear of the clichs hidden beneath the surface by adding a lot of warmth and humor to the cold and harsh emotions that are brought out in the family by the tragedy. It's a good idea, but unfortunately, the mix just doesn't work.

451490,4,630231402X,"This movie exceeded my expectations as I had initially pegged it as a predictable tearjerker based on the plot. The leads in the form of Pierce Brosnan, Susan Sarandon, and the divine Carey Mulligan deliver credible and compelling performances that made this an engaging human drama. The prevalent theme in this movie is grief and coming to terms with loss - Bennett Brewer (Aaron Johnson) is a popular student at his high school but deep down he is shy around girls and waits till the last day of school to ask Rose (Carey Mulligan) out. The two hit it off and fall head over heels in love. Bennett chooses an inopportune moment to declare his love to Rose, and tragedy strikes, killing Bennett.

Three months later, Rose arrives at Bennett's house and is greeted by his father, Allen (Pierce Brosnan). The Bennett's epitomize a family torn apart by grief - mom Grace (Susan Sarandon) appears totally overwhelmed by grief to the point that she acts irrationally; Allen puts on a calm appearance although deep inside, he struggles to come to terms with his son's death and the strain it places on his marriage and his younger son; younger son Ryan (Johnny Simmons) is a druggie who attends support meetings but detached, feeling a sense of resentment towards his dead brother who was the favored child and who even in death seems to hog all the attention. Rose finds herself in a conundrum - she is pregnant with Bennett's child and has nowhere to go. Allen warms to her immediately and takes her in, but Grace is mistrusting and unwilling to welcome the young woman.

The story flows well and the various characters credibly portray their grief and the process of healing, even though in the case of Grace it takes a long time for her to accept that her favorite son is dead. The sub-plots do not get any real development - Jennifer Ehle plays Allen's colleague at school (he is a college instructor) who still harbors feelings for him (the pair were apparently involved in an intimate relationship some time ago), and Ryan falls for a girl in his support group.

Carey Mulligan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Education/dp/B002ONC9NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Education</a>&nbsp;delivers a finely nuanced performance as the young mother-to-be. This is a young actress who is showing the potential to be a great character actress and her role as Rose struck a chord in me. Pierce Brosnan is compelling in the role of the stressed out college instructor who can't seem to 'reach' his wife in her grief. Sarandon delivers a good performance as well though there are parts in the movie where her grief seems to be displayed with over-the-top histrionics without striking a note of credibility or emotionally connecting with this viewer.

On the whole, my husband and I both liked ""The Greatest"" - thanks to the compelling acting by the leads, the movie rises above being a common tearjerker/ melodrama.",1276905600,7,2953,5.008146639511201
451491,5,630231402X,"THE GREATEST is a small film, quietly made in 28 days by  first-time writer/director Shana Feste.  The story/script is so unusual and touching that she was able to gather a rather extraordinary cast to bring this delicate story to life.  It remains amazing to many of us that while the audiences flock to the gigantic CGI big noisy flicks, little jewels such as this film go completely unnoticed.  The only hope is that enough people see this film now on DVD that that both the message of the movie and the quality of the acting and production gain the attention THE GREATEST so justly deserves.

Without introductory remarks the film opens with a brief prelude of the love between two (just graduated from high school) youngsters who after their first encounter with love pause on the drive home to attempt to make their feelings into words and BAM - a truck plunges into them and the boy Bennett (Aaron Johnson) is killed while the girl Rose (Carey Mulligan) is spared. The camera takes us rather abruptly to the graveside where the grieving parents Grace (Susan Sarandon) and Allen (Pierce Brosnan)  and their young drug addicted son Ryan (Johnny Simmons) stare blankly into the hole that has been placed in the middle of their lives.  None of the family copes with the death well: Grace can't stop talking and crying about Bennett and searches for a way to find out how Bennett spent the last 17 minutes of his life (that time between the accident and his death) to the point of attending to the truck driver (Michael Shannon) in coma at the local hospital, awaiting his recovery to learn about those 17 minutes; Allen is unable to sleep and tries to cope with the tragedy by not allowing mention of it in his home; Ryan, now on frequent tests to see if he is drug free, attempts to relate to a group therapy session of kids whose siblings have died.

Into this dysfunctional crumbling decimated family comes Rose, three months later, pregnant with Bennett's child, seeking refuge from a mother who is an addict.  She is invited to move in, despite the fact that Grace loathes the idea and thinks Allen is merely trying to resolve the grief he has ever faced by attaching to Bennett's only girlfriend.  The remainder of the story reveals how each of these injured four characters gradually interact and by  bearing their personal grief with their own life problems manage to find a place where they can recover together.

The acting is superb as one would expect from such a talented cast: Carey Mulligan again shows us that she is an important emerging actress; Susan Sarandon allows us to see and understand the degrees of near insanity that grief for loss of a child can distort a life; and Pierce Brosnan proves he is a first-rate actor, managing a difficult role with great sensitivity.  The rest of the cast is also excellent in very minor roles - Jennifer Ehle as an ex-lover of Allen, Aaron Johnson and Johnny Simmons as the brothers, and Michael Shannon as the driver of the truck who gradually awakens form his come to make Grace face some truths. As for Shana Feste,  she is a strong artist and we should be seeing more beautifully crafted stories from her.  Grady Harp, June 10",1276387200,15,3193,4.656583629893238

I love the young womans courage and her realization that this boy was the love of her life.  She is the one true adult in the film because she chooses to embrace not the loss but the love and how that love changed her life.  I love the end.

I think the heart of Susan Sarandons character is bitter and raw.  But, also emmotionally pure.  I love the brother and some of his great one liners.  As this screw up.

451588,4,630231402X,"This movie came out in 2009 but I don't ever remember it showing in theaters.  Perhaps it only made it to DVD, not sure.  In any case, I stumbled upon it and was pleasantly surprised that Carey Mulligan is in it along with long time stalwarts, Pierce Brosnan and Susan Sarandon.  There is no question the film by young director Shana Feste is long on emotional manipulation and melodrama but it also feels real to me.

Brosnan and Sarandon play parents of an 18 year old boy (Aaron Johnson from ""Kickass"") who is killed in a car accident, but not before he impregnates his new girlfriend (Mulligan).  Her mom's a junkie so Rose (Mulligan) shows up at the grief stricken parent's door.  The story deals with how they all respond to the death of the son.  In addition, there is a now ignored younger brother that is coping as well.  I think most thoughtful parents will understand what each must be going through.  Each handles it differently, and it's messy, confusing and filled with conflict.  Terrific acting brings the movie over the ""Lifetime"" hurdle and makes it worth seeing.",1330905600,,1081,4.671957671957672

451590,3,630231402X,"Despite key performances that ring very true, the films overall impact is dampened by the outrageous ending that allows the tightly constructed character development to lose its naturalness, completely unraveling what it has worked so hard to achieve.

What was that all about?

The story is one that is emotionally stirring for sure.  It centers on a married couple, Grace and Allen, who suffer an emotional shock to their lives when their teenage son Bennett is killed in a car accident.  What happens next is equal parts tragic and beautiful as we see these two caring parents reduced to polar opposites as they battle each other grief by lathering on more grief.  It doesn't help that they grieve in drastically different ways (as is so true with most couples) and so they are constantly on edge with one another.  Add to the mix a drug addicted younger son, who is battling guilt for the way he regarded his brother, and a young woman who happens to be carrying Bennett's child, and you have a recipe for tear stained pillows.

Sadly, it all falls apart in the films resolution.

It is rare that a film can build up such a momentum that a singular mistake can cost it my devoted adoration.  This year another film destroyed itself with its conclusion (I'm looking at you `I Am Love'), but even that film regains some respect upon further contemplation.  What `The Greatest' does with the films final frames is a near travesty.  It takes a perfectly somber and insightful family drama and reduces it to a sappy comedy.  The whole woods scene was a mess and that car ride (""SHOW ME THE FACE"") was laughably awkward and just felt like a different film altogether.  In fact, everything that happened after Michael Shannon's awakening (why couldn't he stay in the coma) was a downhill race to clichd horridness.  It just discredited the honesty that the film was shooting for (or at least what I thought it was shooting for).

But, the key performances here do make up for it in a way and make the film worth visiting, especially Carey Mulligan's heartbreaking performance as Rose, the young woman with a baby in her belly and a dire need to `know' the man who fathered it.  Her scene with Brosnan (another great performance) where she tells him about meeting Bennett was just devastatingly real and sincere.  Even though some of the plots weaknesses (namely the relationship between Rose and Bennett) are exposed in that monologue, it is the most impressionable part of the film and Mulligan sells every word.

So, in the end I recommend seeing it, but don't expect it to be as wonderful as A.T. Hurley's review would have you think.
