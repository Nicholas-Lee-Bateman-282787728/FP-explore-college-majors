2269939,3,B00097DY2U,"The first few episodes, which still have Harry Goz (Capt Murphy) and Erik Estrada (Marco), are really good and funny.  These include Tourist Season, Red Dawn (one of my favorite Sealab episodes), Meet Beck Bristow, and I Robot Really.

There are then 2 episodes without Capt Murphy (Harry Goz died) and Marco (Estrada's apearances on the show became less frequent for some reason) which are decent; these 2, Frozen Dinner and Splitsville, are both funny but clearly suffer from not having Capt Murphy or Marco.

The rest of the episodes feature Tornado Shanks as the new captain (voiced by Goz's son).  ASHDTV and Chalkboard Jungle are both funny but again are just not as good as episodes from earlier in the series; they are showing signs of the new ""direction"" the show takes in later episodes.

This new ""direction"" is clear in the rest of the episodes on the DVD.  They are just plain stupid.  Rather than having humerous situations and dialog like the show used to have, they resort to totally random stuff in an attempt to be funny.  The ""jokes"" are more blunt and they really kill them.

I know some people like these types of jokes and find the new episodes funny, but I don't.  To me, the new Sealab episodes have the same problems as the new Family Guy episodes they've started showing again on Fox and the newer Simpsons episodes (like season  11 on).  Hard to explain - you either know what I'm talking about because you feel the same way about these shows or you don't.",1125446400,9,1483,4.6183206106870225
2269940,4,B00097DY2U,"The last of the shows voiced by the hilarious and talented Harry Goz appear on this set, and that alone makes it worth the price. The first of the newer shows with the new Captain Shanks character (voiced by Harry Goz's son, Michael Goz) are also very funny, although it is clear in some places that the writers had as much trouble adjusting to the changes they were forced to make as the fans. As most fans know, episodes after the ones in this set take a serious down-turn in writing quality, so much so that it is hard to believe they were produced by the same people. So, if you found the early Sealab 2021 absolutely hilarious, be sure to buy this set because it contains the last of the comedy gems in the series. There are extras on this set, including two unaired episodes and some commentary, although the extras tend to be hit or miss in quality as in previous sets depending on your taste. But, whether or not you like the extras, you'll love the episodes. Recommended!",1122854400,2,980,4.419889502762431
2269941,5,B00097DY2U,"Alright! More insanity from the sadly now defunct Sealab. By this season, the show hit it's stride. Every episode is hilarious, the humor is faster and more densely packed in. The only episodes i skip are ones that i have taped and watched a million times, and sometimes i see new jokes in those to. The extras are decent, two unaired but still funny episodes, a pilot even older and crappier than the one on the first set. The commentaries are silly again, this time they are almost all about Cornelius Drebble, inventor of the submarine (pretty funny). Every review i have read has been bashing the show after it lost the wonderful Harry Goz(Captain Murphy), but i don't see why. He was incredibly talented and a hilarious character, but the show was starting to run out of plots based on Murphy's insane stupidity. This is sacrilege to many, but i think some of the best episodes are the final ones, even without Murphy. Losing him forced the writers to look for new ways to start or move stories along, and the jokes come even faster. Every episode on this set is hilarious and it includes what may be my favorite episode, ""ASHDTV"" where the crew spends most of the show watching digital cable. It becomes a nonstop stream of jokes that shows how good this show got in the end. I still miss some jokes because i am laughing so hard at others. Hesh Prince Baby! That episode is the first one after introducing Tornado Shanks, and along with ""I Robot, Really"" it also signals a shift in Dr. Quinn's character. At first he was brilliant and little egotiscal, but for the rest of the series he usually drunk, whining, or acting almost as stupid as the rest of the crew. Not as big a change as the new captain, but i still think it changes the shows dynamic. Sealab only got better and better, and i hope the decision to end it was made by the creators and not because some fans didn't like the new captain. And to any who question my Adult Swim street cred, I have been watching and taping it since the first night, and even watched ""Oblongs"", ""Mission Hill"", and ""home Movies"" when they originally aired on the WB and NbC. All hail Sparkimus Prime!",1122163200,2,2149,4.48469387755102
2269942,5,B00097DY2U,"The third season of Sealab 2021 was a bittersweet one to say the least.  Harry Goz, voice of the hilariously maniacal Captain Murphy, died after lending his voice for the first four episodes, and his son Michael eventually took his place as Captain Tornado Shanks.  Many Sealab viewers believe that Shanks' arrival signaled the downfall of the series, but this is quite untrue.  ""Chalkboard Jungle"", in which Shanks assists Quinn in substituting Debbie Love's class, wouldn't work the same without him, while ""Dearly Beloved Seed"" is possibly the most off the wall episode of Sealab ever.  ""Red Dawn"", in which Captain Murphy introduces a Communist regime to Sealab and he wages war with JFK, must be seen to be believed.  Yes, this was the beginning of the series going downhill writing wise, but for die hard Adult Swim viewers who immensely enjoyed Sealab 2021, the fact that these are Harry Goz's final vocal performances are reason enough to own this alone.  The special features are once again dismal, this time there are no commentaries (even though I really wouldn't consider the commentaries on Season two worth hearing), and a few extra episodes, including the original version of ""Dearly Beloved Seed"" and some unaired material.",1122076800,17,1239,5.049019607843137
2269943,4,B00097DY2U,Some great stuff on this disk. Sadly it is also the last of the Captain Murphy episodes. With the passing of Harry Koz Sealab kinda loses a lot of its fun. This disk is full of cool little extras and two never before seen episodes. Well worth the buy.,1121817600,,251,4.142857142857143
2269944,4,B00097DY2U,"This is the last 'Sealab 2021' season that's gonna be worth owning.  This is where it started to crash, with a general dip in quality, and one really rather questionable episode. (Dearly Beloved Seed)  But, overall it's still damn good, and has a few truly great episodes. (Though not quite the funniest episode of the show, 'Red Dawn' is probably my favorite episode.  In fact, each of the episodes where Murphy is still around ranges from very good to excellent)  Course, the show really had no hope of maintaining itself with Murphy gone.  It's not that there is anything inherently wrong with Shanks; I think he's pretty funny. (And much of the time, he might as well be Murphy, other than the voice-acting, which proves to be a huge difference.)  But Murphy was always the heart of the show and the funniest character, so you can't expect it to hold up with out him.  Course, it turns out that Goz's death isn't the only problem.  The writing totally went to hell after this season.  Not everything made after this is completely worthless, but it's been weak enough that I never really bothered to watch it consistently.  But, that's the next season, and Season 3 is still really cool.

Also, the packaging for this season is really neat, and seems to be a lot more solid and durable than the other ones.",1121558400,23,1309,4.623376623376624
2269945,5,B00097DY2U,"Season three of Sealab 2021 is a bitter sweet one. It's the season that we say goodbye to Harry Goz who played Captain Murphy on the program. Harry was an accomplished stage and screen actor who, somehow, made his way to this zany show. This season's best Harry Goz episode, in my opinion, is the one in which he is a Communist dictator hellbent on starting a war with the US while a Kennedy-esque president is distracted from the crisis by women and poker.

We see the arrival, this easson, of Captain Tornado Shanks. Shanks is Goz's replacement (voiced by Harry's son, Michael). Some see this as the downfall of the show, but I disagree. The greatest episodes of this season (ASHDTV, and Neptunia) are Shanks episodes.

This is also the season that introduces Debbie Love (or ""Black"" Debbie). It's a riot to hear the cast discuss whether or not it's right to label her ""Black"" Debbie. Bottom line: The show keeps us laughing this season. Buy it, and you won't be disapointed.",1121126400,2,977,4.641618497109826

2269972,2,B00097DY2U,"This show is very hit or miss, in general, but with Harry Goz no longer voicing Murphy, it's just lost its charm. It's not that he was the glue that held the show together, but that the writers seem lost without his presence on the cast. The episodes feel like someone blindfolded himself and is throwing darts at a humor board - i.e. some of the jokes are so off (and not funny), you wonder how anyone would even consider them jokes. Unless cross-dressing trannies are funny to you. Let's just toss a tranny on the show (Hesh) and things will be funny, right?!? RIGHT?!? [rolls eyes] Season 3 is like watching someone drown - the show keeps sinking lower and lower as the season progresses, and there's nothing you can do to save it! :-(",1369785600,,738,4.4338235294117645

2269976,3,B00097DY2U,"In Disc 1, you get to see cannibals, Murphy turning into the Bar-Bo-Bot robot, Murphy turning into a mad dictator, snobby actor Beck Bristo being a jerk to the crew and several nuclear deformities and explosions. However, you'll also see how Tornado Sacks replaced Captain Murphy as Murphy apparently went off to fight in the Great Spice Wars. In real life, the guy who did the voice of Murphy died due to a terminal, rare form of cancer oddly enough according to the special features of Season 2 (not on either disc for Season 3).

In Disc 2, you'll see rapping Hesh become ""The One,"" at another one of Debbie's weddings with an alternate version in the special features, Stormy's humerously ignorant rants about politics (in Special Features) and...that's about it for the good stuff on Disc 2.

The biggest thing wrong with Season 3 is an overall lack of Captain Murphy. Even though the voice actor for Murphy died in real life, the replacement character just doesn't seem to stack up to Murphy's wackiness. Tornado Sacks (again, replaces Murphy), is a southner meant to be the typically un-realistic, loveable idiot that only exists way too often in Hollywood productions. Tornado is more of a typical and mediocore character than he is a funny one and Tornado's stereotypical, cowboy foolishness just ends up being a poor substitute for Murphy's oblivous and yet totally hilarious insanity. There just always seems to be something missing when Murphy disappears after Episode 4.

Dispite an overall lack of Murphy and the average Tornado, many of the episodes of Season 3 still have a lot crazy plots with tons of chaos going on that seem satisfying enough for me to say that Season 3 was just a descent season for SeaLab 2021. Season 1 and 2 were better, but I'd say 3 is just worthy enough to add to the collection.",1350345600,,1822,4.7594936708860756
2269977,3,B00097DY2U,"Its remarkable how bad the show got after Harry (Capt. Murphy) died.  There's a few episodes with him left on here which are always great.  If I was king i would have not added any more characters and just made Quinn captain.  Or heck maybe even Hesh!  Would not have made sense but think of the potential.  All the characters are great, except the new captain who I've heard is related to Harry in real life.  I don't know his characters name because frankly nobody needed to.  The show would have been light years better if they only maintained the original crew and pressed on from there.  If for some tragic reason you are buying this DVD set before buy 1 or 2 then do yourself a favor and choke yourself...jk I mean go buy the first 2, watch them over and over for one month straight until you can quote each line and then move on to frisky dingo (ANOTHER MAJOR RECOMMENDATION)",1309651200,,882,4.368098159509202

2269979,5,B00097DY2U,"If you like the off-beat humor of Williams Street productions (ATHF, Space Ghost Coast to Coast), I think this is their best work. I actually remember the original SeaLab cartoon, which even as a youngster I thought was really lame. Taking the original and having the characters say the ridiculous things they say is sheer genius. Some of the scenes I played over and over and just kept laughing. If you have an off-beat sense of humor, this is for you. Or you might try waiting to see if they show any more episodes on Adult Swim, but they haven't in a long time.

Seasons one and two of the DVD's had some high quality commentary, while the only decent commentary on this set is the first episode with Shanks whereas they let a third party completely rip the episode, and the third season of the series, apart, literally saying ""If you bought this I feel bad for you"" I swear, its in the commentary and its very true.  Season 3 just was not at all entertaining after Murphy died.  The best episode of the set is one in the special features that never aired...  Overall, I am strongly disappointed.

A lot of friends think I'm an idiot for liking this show- so be prepared for one goofy show!

Is this the last great season?  Who knows- I'm just some schmuck reviewer on Amazon.  But don't be confused by the childish drama- these are fun and goofy as before.  As much as I liked the early shows, this is not some character driven drama, it is a crazy cartoon.",1143763200,4,637,4.048
