4595578,4,B0057GUD7C,"Now this is a really good movie. Maybe even the best I've seen this year. It reminded me a lot of the Bourne films, except this time the person laying the beat downs and killing people left and right is a young girl that even Hit-Girl would envy. Basically she is trained to be a lethal assassin by her father, who has a background in the subject, in a remote cabin cut off from the outside world. Let's just say that some covert operation from years back had some loose ends that needed tying up, so of course they are now the targets, but boy did they mess with the wrong duo.

I liked the strong European feel from the locations to the small character parts throughout. It was kind of like entering a different world. Throw in some well choreographed fight scenes that don't shy away from the violence despite the PG-13 rating and you've got quite the feast. It's even peppered with a number of light hearted moments that might bring a smile to your face. The directing, camera work, writing and music were also of high caliber, but the strong level of acting on display really stole the show.

There are a number of really talented young actresses at the moment (Hailee Steinfeld and Chlo Grace Moretz for example), but Saoirse Ronan is in the same league if not even better. I had previously seen her in Atonement and The Lovely Bones and while I had issues with both of those films, she was the definite standout. Her line delivery and facial expressions continue to amaze for someone her age. This is her best role by far. You will believe she is not someone to mess with. Eric Bana is convincing as her father and Cate Blanchett turns in one of her best roles ever in my opinion. What a bad lady. Even the weirdo psycho killer working for Blanchett is memorable in a part that could have been a throwaway.

Now for some minor negatives. A couple of parts did get a little slow and once the mystery is revealed it's more of a been there done that kind of deal, but overall Hanna remains a unique blending for an action film. One that actually has the smarts to stretch beyond the genre's normal limitations.

And yes, I was so close to giving this 5 stars, but in the end I just couldn't pull the trigger.",1302307200,,2212,4.38780487804878
4595579,4,B0057GUD7C,"Hanna felt like The Little Engine That Could right from the start. When the trailer first started being shown in theaters, it looked to have potential while featuring a solid cast. But it felt like a smaller film that would leave a big impact once you finally got around to seeing it. There were a few things working against the film. I'm fairly certain that the only film of Joe Wright's that I've actually had the opportunity to sit down and watch is The Soloist. Despite being enjoyable, its weak online reputation along with movie critics less than stellar ratings and reviews imply that the film missed its mark. Speaking of missing its mark, Saoirse Ronan was also in Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones which couldn't really decide what type of film to be and was more than a little disappointing overall. Luckily, Hanna doesn't suffer that same fate and we're actually given a film that is much stronger than it lets on.

Hanna really utilizes the two senses you use most while watching a movie to their maximum potential. The beautiful cinematography is done in a way that let's you see things in a completely different light. There's a fairly wide contrast in scenery in the film; everything from the wooded forest to the dry, desolate desert to big cities to playgrounds and parks. Whether it's a cabin being covered by snow out in the middle of a Finnish forest, an expanding look at the rocky and seemingly endless desert floor, or just admiring the several sunsets utilized throughout the film to bridge one scene to the next, the camera work in Hanna is something that should definitely catch your eye.

While we're on the subject of camera work, there are quite a few intriguing perspective techniques used in Hanna as well. Some of the most noteworthy scenes in the film are one-take or long-take sequences meaning no cutaways or chances to do it again without starting from the beginning. The best example is a scene involving Erik (Eric Bana) where he gets off a bus and is being tailed by four agents sent by Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett). The way that scene is filmed along with its climax is just spectacular. That same technique is used several times throughout the film and seems to make something simple like a chase through a junkyard way more entertaining than if it was filmed differently. Another interesting shot is when Erik finds Marissa in her hotel room. A battle of bullets breaks out as we look through one of the bullet holes to see Erik kicking the door in. Good stuff right there, boys and girls. Good stuff indeed.

The other sense that's capitalized upon is what the film allows you to hear. Hanna features an original score by The Chemical Brothers and it doesn't disappoint. I'm not exactly a big fan of house music, techno, trip hop, or any music genre of that nature, but there's something about this soundtrack that adds something a different genre or artist probably wouldn't have been able to capture if they had been fortunate enough to do this soundtrack instead. Those beats and that electronic sound may not sound like they should be a part of a film like this, but it's an essential part of the film that makes the chase scenes involving Hanna more suspenseful and it's practically impossible to imagine Tom Hollander's ""sandman"" scene without that creepy bell-heavy lullaby. Truth be told, the Hanna soundtrack is every bit as good as the TRON: Legacy soundtrack.

The action thriller has a fantastic way of coming full circle. The beginning and end come together in a way that feels similar, but is done in a satisfying way that makes the storyline feel complete. Hanna actually has a little bit of humor hidden in its depths, as well. Most of it involves Sophie (Jessica Barden) in some capacity. The ""three bullets"" scene is the first that comes to mind. The entire theater seemed to be in an uproar over that one.

The one thing that didn't seem to click with Hanna was the editing. It's like the editor became incredibly overzealous being in possession of a soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers and certain scenes seemed more complicated than necessary. Hanna's (Saoirse Ronan) escape from holding was the scene that brought this theory to light. Flashing lights and scenes of Hanna running episode down along with multiple shots of her face in one frame just made the entire scene feel like an epileptic's nightmare.

Hanna is a fantastically paced action thriller that features strong performances from a powerful cast and a storyline that's rounded out in the best of ways. Eric Bana nearly steals the show at times while you may want to kill Cate Blanchett at other times for her Texan accent alone, but Saoirse Ronan puts in a performance that may be the best of her career thus far. Top it off with a spectacular soundtrack from The Chemical Brothers, and Hanna becomes one of the first must-see films of the year that is both intelligent and features slap-the-taste-out-of-your-mouth action.",1302220800,2,4956,4.777129521586931
4595580,3,B0057GUD7C,"""Hanna"" is a moderately entertaining movie, worth viewing just for the terrific acting by the trio of Cate Blanchett, Saoirse Ronan, and Eric Bana.  But ultimately, I can't give it that high of a rating because it lacks a heart and soul, and despite being a two hour long movie, the many action sequences squeeze out scenes or plot points that would have let us understand or feel for the major characters.

Saoirse Ronan reprises her ongoing roles as a young teenaged girl on a journey of discovery.  She has played this part before, in ""City of Ember"", and ""Lovely Bones"" and is a terrific actress.  Here in this movie, her hair and eyebrows and eyelashes have been bleached nearly white (she is normally a natural light brunette), giving her an ethereal quality, almost like a fairy or a wood elf.  The difference in this movie is that her character is not a normal teenage girl, as we soon discover, and so she has this flat and emotionless affect through most of the movie.

Cate Blanchett, what to say except that she is again wonderful, playing this fiercely evil CIA agent.  Blanchett has been one of my favorite actresses after her role as Galadriel -  I couldn't imagine anybody else playing that role ever again.

Eric Bana has never been one of my favorite actors, as he seems to have cornered the market on roles as earnest but ultimately failed heroes.  But he is an excellent actor.

The movie has a lot of action sequences, with lots of running.  The change from one scene to another is herky jerky,  as we jump from the wilderness of Finland to an underground fortress in Morocco, to a tourist campground in Morocco, to Berlin, and then once in Berlin, from a rundown amusement park to her father's apartment, to her grandmother's apartment and then back to the amusement park.

The action is also excessively stylish as if it were supposed to mean something.  Why have the final denouement in an amusement park, starting in a house styled like a gingerbread fairy tale house?  Why have Cate Blanchett's #1 evil henchman whistle a jaunty tune as he stalks his prey?  I mean, won't that give him away?

The movie left tons of loose ends and unanswered questions at the end.  The motivations of the two adult antagonists are left only partially answered.  Just why was Cate Blanchett's character chasing so hard after her quarry?  And why did she do all those awful things in the past?  The only answer given by Eric Bana's character on his motivations for what he did is wierdly simple and unsatisfying:  ""Because kids grow up"" (like duh, but don't you think a good father would want his beloved daughter to have something better in life than become a pre-programmed assassin?).

At the end of the movie, I could say only that this movie was entertaining but not memorable.  Like Saoirse Ronan's character, the movie was so busy running that all the heart and soul and motivations got left out.

But, heck, I sure am looking forward to seeing Cate and Saoirse together again in ""The Hobbitt"" surely a movie that will be better than this one, with Peter Jackson producing.  ""Hanna"" only proves that Saoirse Ronan is a natural to play the part of a wood elf.",1302220800,7,3172,4.637992831541219
4595581,4,B0057GUD7C,"A very good film, the acting in particular. Saoirse Ronan was terrific already. Her recent more films are varied and her characters in them are a pleasure to watch.

4595598,4,B0057GUD7C,"very unique and good performances by all,  except,  oddly,  the great actress Cate Blanchett.  But the young Hanna, Saoirse Roana from Lovely Bones,  does a great job as a
rather unempathetic genetically engineered girl who doesn't want to hurt anybody but..  if you force me.  she is not as frightening as  ""Morgan,'  but just as thorough, just as dangerous in the long run.  The performance of Tom Hollander is the counter weight to Cate Blanchett.  She is poorly cast here,  why not just get an American who does a southern accent if you must have that.  It is badly drawn.  His character is frightening,  a memorable badguy,  all the worst attributes of Gemans rolled up into one little phsycopath.  His pursuit of Hanna is disturbing.
Eric Bana is very good in this movie.  I found him as convincing as he was in Munich,  maybe more so,  a simple performance but
complex in the confusion he feels about his role with Hanna.",1517097600,,928,4.645962732919255

4595608,4,B0057GUD7C,"RELEASED IN 2011 and directed by Joe Wright, ""Hanna"" starts off in the wintery wilderness of northern Finland where an ex-CIA father (Eric Bana) has been training his teen daughter, the titular character (Saoirse Ronan), to survive in a harsh world of cutthroat government agents. When the girl's ready, she's introduced to the real world where she's ruthlessly hunted down from North Africa to Germany by a mysterious intelligence operative, Marissa (Cate Blanchett), and her heavies.

What I like best about this movie is its uniqueness, stylishness and picturesque globetrotting. This is top-of-the-line filmmaking with a hip, kinetic, quirky tone and superlative score, comparable to ""Lucy"" (2014) and Tarantino thrillers like ""Kill Bill"" (2003/2004). It's not a great film because there's not enough depth or mindfood, but it contains a few elements of greatness and is overall entertaining enough.

We learn Marissa is preoccupied with Hanna for unknown reasons; so, while she's an expert agent, this obsession is her kryptonite. Subtext-wise, the movie's an obvious metaphor for a child reaching adulthood and the agonies of being a loving parent (preparing them for the world, teaching them necessary skills to survive, giving them increasing freedom, being candid about the callousness of life). It's also somewhat of a fairytale about the relationship between a father and daughter. Later in the film Marissa asks Erik, ""Why now?"" and he simply replies, ""Kids grow up.""

I liked the dichotomy of the so-called normal banality of the civilians compared to the single-minded cold-bloodedness of the agents. If you object to the sometimes unwieldy fight scenes, go parent a child, wait eighteen years, then view it again and see if you feel the same. The film's often thrilling, but don't approach this as a straight action flick or you'll probably be disappointed.

There are low-key things that are clumsily explored, like the RV family perking Hanna's curiosity about life (remember she grew up isolated in the northern wilds), but this was an obvious mechanism to make us feel bad that she was on this life-or-death mission, and different than these ""normal"" kids, yet at the same time special and more exciting, which is how the daughter & kid brother viewed Hanna. The individual used as a tool is hardly innovative, but I nonetheless appreciated this take on it.

THE FILM RUNS 111 minutes and was shot in Finland, Morocco and (mostly) Germany. WRITERS: Seth Lochhead & David Farr.

Let me spare you the $2.99 to rent this: Somewhat of a spoiler, but not really - after all the trailer is basically the entire move: Bad people want girl, girl doesn't know why, but knows enough to take them all out (uh, yeah, okay, sure), girl goes on the run, get's chased, and everyone dies but her. No happy ending, no unhappy ending, just basically you watch chasing and killing, and then no resolution for the girl. No plot. Moved slow. Glad I only spent $2.99 on it. The score wasn't even that good - juvenile and totally mismatched.

Although Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) has been trained to be a lethal combative girl, she has also never been exposed to the world outside of the forest and snow covered plains of the remote wilderness she has grown up in. She has never known anyone other than her father/trainer, and for her encounters with other kids on the outside, will be very confusing.  But she doesn't have too much time to be confused or take in what she comes across as she is being pursued by armed mercenaries, and must rendezvous with her father (Eric Bana).  I never really got why the two never just left their home together, and why she had to push some button to put these events in motion, but the storyline is what is it.

4595680,4,B0057GUD7C,"I had this movie in my watchlist for a long time.  The idea intrigued me but I worried that a movie about a kid assassin would be completely devoid of morality and therefore depressing/skivvy, not entertaining.  I finally watched it.

It was wonderfully entertaining.  It was about getting rid of bad guys. The characters are well done and I really connected emotionally with the father and daughter.  Saoirse Ronan was amazing in this (and has since gone off and done even more amazing things).

The pace is slow but stays interesting.  Clearly, the well-honed assassin was going to do something great (not awful).  The spectacular cinematography is compelling while the story slowly builds to the point.  The camera angles, changes in perspective, and lighting jumped out as particularly artistic.

Once the story gets to the point, the fight scenes were well done and kept real (no silly Kung Fu) but I had come to expect that Hanna would be a little more decisive in her battles.  For all that training and being the perfect assassin, the fights lasted too long.  The SIGNIFICANTLY less capable bad guys shouldnt have lasted more than a few seconds. I accepted the premise that she was a highly honed weapon and suspended belief.  The director/writers didn't for some reason and went too far trying to make it too real.

But getting passed that disappointment, the chase, interspersed with character development and fight scenes, is suspenseful and entertaining.  It has flaws, some quite irritating, but I still liked it. I wasn't inspired but I was entertained.",1477699200,7,1567,4.973076923076923

I want her to see this movie.  There has been a sharp shift in how women/girls are being portrayed in film, and this is a good example how to make a good story while showing women in a strong positive light.",1477094400,,498,4.040816326530612

Ronan, whose name is appropriate for this role, has starred in many award winning films and is recognizable. Her dad sends her away in Europe but she finds that it is not easy being a spy, especially a super spy. Agents pursue her and fight after fight ensues! Martial arts mayhem and stealth warfare galore!

Instead you just are left waiting for something to happen to move the story along. The biggest fault I had with the movie was the fact that she left the family to die. It was super obvious that if she had killed the three guys following her no one else would know where she was or where she was going. Plus because she had so easily killed the soldiers before, you can't argue that she was bothered by killing or couldn't.

4595802,2,B0057GUD7C,"What a horible, nonsensical, boring mess! I couldn't believe my eyes! I didn't even manage to finish this film - after 90 minutes, with 20 more minutes to go, I gave up, because I didn't care anymore how it will end, I just wanted this ordeal to be over. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

Erik Heller (Eric Bana) lives somewhere in the wilderness in a log cabin in northern Finland with his 15-year old daughter Hanna (Saoirse Ronan). They live a tough life, surviving in large part on the hunted game, never seeing anyone else. Erik trained his daughter in survival, hunting, shooting, martial arts and taught her also numerous languages, in order to prepare her for an unavoidable confrontation with Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett), a woman who has some mysterious link with Hanna and Erik. One day Hanna declares that she is ready... And then the film really begins.

The beginning and the general idea seemed very promising - but ten minutes into the film, things TOTALLY unravel and the story never recovers. nothing in this film makes the SLIGHTEST SENSE! That in itself wouldn't be too serious, as after all most action movies have nonsensical scenarios - but here things are made worse by the pervasive sense of boredom instilled by:

- total predictability,
- going-through-the-motions we-saw-it-all-a-thousand-times-before action scenes
- lame, morbidly incompetent and incredibly weird villains (SPOILER: the main villain's sidekick is a homosexual owner of a transvestite strip club, who makes his evil work in underwear...)
- main character not being allowed to act, as Hanna is half-autistic
- dialogs in form of irrelevant, out-of-line, illogical non-sequiturs
- secondary characters so freakishly insane that they all seem to suffer from Asperger syndrom
- etc., etc.

I should have known what to expect. The director of ""Hanna"" began his career by butchering the one story that I always thought couldn't be messed up - ""Pride and Prejudice"", the horrible, horrible, horrible 2005 version with Keira Knghtley. I also saw ""Pan"" trailer before watching ""Hanna"" and I immediately decided to NOT see it. But I took a chance with this film, because of my admiration for Sairse Ronan, who is amongst the most impressive young actresses actually in the business. She impressed me in ""City of Ember"", ""The way back"" and ""The host"" and she even performed very well in the rather less successful ""Byzantium"". Here, even her unconventional beauty and great talent can't save this failed film - but still, her presence in itself is reason enough to give ""Hanna"" a second star.

This is a very, very bad film, wasting horribly the talent of three good actors. I regret that I watched the 90 minutes of it - it was still 90 minutes too much. Thanks God I only rented it instead of buying. AVOID THIS THINGY!",1444780800,,2836,4.962105263157895

4595822,4,B0057GUD7C,"I found this a better movie to think about after the fact than it was to see.  Clearly, it's very thoughtfully put together, and visually it is consistently striking, though the experience of seeing it made me think that the three genres that are being blended here perhaps don't hang together very well.  The genres are action thriller, futuristic cautionary tale, and fairy tale.  The first has been better done in the Bourne movies; in the second, ""Blade Runner"" stands out; and in third, maybe Cocteau's 1946 ""La Belle et la Bete"" is a good example.  But of course, these movies aren't exactly trying to put things together in the way ""Hanna"" is.  I don't much care for action thrillers, so that aspect of the story bored me -- but that's just me.  Many people like this genre, and the director of ""Hanna,"" Joe Wright, has every right to make the movie he wants to make -- and I've found it worth reflecting on.

In the back story, Erik Heller (Eric Bana) is an ex-CIA operative who had been engaged in a program to genetically alter infants so that they would grow up to be killing machines -- ""perfect soldiers"" is his phrase.  The program seems to have been shut down by an upper-level CIA administrator, Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett) and the infants involved have been eliminated -- all except Hanna, whose mother is killed by Wiegler, who can't however, prevent Erik from escaping with Hanna (Saoirse Ronan).  He raises Hanna according to his program, and his goal is to have her kill Wiegler.  In fairy story terms, Wiegler comes across as a kind of wicked witch here, but Heller isn't benevolent -- he seems not to be Hanna's biological father.  I would call him a ""mad scientist"" figure.  He brings Hanna up in the woods of Finland, and while they are in a sense attached to one another, it's obviously a perverse relationship.  Hanna's skill in unarmed combat with Heller is what wins his approval.  So ironically, it's possible to see the wicked witch as being in the right here -- except that Wiegler's determination to stop Hanna and Heller seems to be driven less by principle (""genetic experiments on human subjects are ethically dubious"") than by jealousy.  Hanna's dying mother's last words, addressed to Wiegler, are ""You'll never have her.""  It sounds like a jibe at Wiegler's childlessness and perhaps sterility, and I wondered if at some point in the past Heller and Wiegler hadn't been lovers as well as colleagues.  The idea of sterility seems to me to be the dominating trope of the movie -- all the settings, Finland in winter, the Moroccan desert in summer, the panopticon at the CIA black site, the glass and steel of Berlin, and the infantilizing Grimm-themed funhouse all say that Hanna has been denatured.  The geo-political aspects of these places hardly register; it's the visual presentation that carries the message.  All that means too that Hanna has no future.  The story comes to a satisfactory action thriller close -- but what then?  The closest Hanna has come to relatively normal human contact is when she travels for a while, after her escape from the panopticon, with a neo-hippie family and their two children.  These scenes afford some humor and some recognizable emotional connections -- but that's it.  It doesn't last.  The cautionary aspect of the story has to do, I think, with the exploitation of technology to manipulate human beings by other human beings driven by ambition, jealousy, hatred, power, or whatever.  The old ""essential"" human tendencies -- and fairy tales seem to me to be almost by definition essentialist -- in a technologically sophisticated age, given free play, threaten to dehumanize our interactions.  We (the audience) are made to feel the pathos of Hanna's situation in a way that Hanna can't and perhaps never will.",1440720000,,3798,4.831530139103555

4595834,2,B0057GUD7C,"Joe Wright seems to prefer literary interpretations like Pride & Prejudice, Atonement and Anna Karenina, but I guess he longed to make an action movie, so we get Hanna, a Grimm account of a young assassin raised in the icy hinterland above the Arctic circle.  The scenery is compelling but not much more in this film, as it is hard to imagine wispy little Hanna as a stone-cold killer.  It would be fine if she caught everyone by surprise, but the surprise was over 30 minutes into the movie when she escapes from the bowels of some top-secret facility buried in the Sahara desert, with an evil Cate Blanchett using a rather goofy trio of hitmen to track Hanna down.  No need to wonder how she got there.  After that it is more or less a travel log through Morocco and Spain with an all too predictable ending.  Along the way Hanna tries to figure out the meaning of her genetic code, which she managed to find before escaping the clutches of Nasty Cate.  Hanna also bonds with a precocious teenage girl traveling with her hippy family, who she tags along with for awhile.

You really never figure out what any of this was about.  It is just Run Hannah Run all the way to Berlin where she finally reunites with her father only to discover some rather inconvenient truths along the way.  Joe makes it interesting for the most part, but it fails to come together as a movie.  It was more like an introduction for a new cinematic franchise, although I doubt anyone will pick up on it as it has been done so many times before.",1438128000,,1522,4.422939068100359

4595891,2,B0057GUD7C,"I got sucked into buying this because Cate Blanchette is in it.  Basically, it's a story about an embittered ex-CIA agent (Eric Bana) has raised a genetically-modified child and trained her to do one thing:  kill Blanchette's character.  The supporting cast, which includes Bana and Blanchette, are completely one dimensional.  There are distractions from the story everywhere.  The ""hippie"" family that finds Hanna wandering in the Moroccan desert, somehow winds up as a major distraction.

I'm not sure what they were trying to accomplish with this script, but it winds up as a mish-mash.  Trying to combine a ""coming of age"" story and an action/assasination movie?  They wind up doing neither one well.  Oh, and there's not really an ending.

Mr. Wright demonstrates the obnoxious habit of saying ahhh and ummm such that no listener can be unaware or, probably, un-repulsed. He says one or the other, usually both, commonly multiple times, in every sentence and nearly every breath. If you know someone who has that habit, and would like to bring it to their attention, entice them to listen to the directors commentary. If, after listening, they're oblivious to the problem, stop wasting your time. Theres no hope.",1423872000,,534,5.01123595505618

4596081,4,B0057GUD7C,"The image of Hanna, with bow and arrow, the front image for the movie, and the promise of the excitement like that of The Green Arrow (Arrow on CW), or Catniss of Hunger Games saga fame suggests that this is a good fit for the lack of great and dangerous young women on the screen lately.  Could Saoirse Ronan be the next Angelina Jolie?

I liked the premise, the whole taught to be awesome warrior thing,  but I didn't get the premise for the rest.  It's not that it doesn't make sense, I just don't understand why someone would take such a great idea and turn it into your average chase scene drawn out for better than an hour.  Why?  Why? There was so much to work with!  Yeah, I like a good deal of the action but I really was a bit let down overall.

Don't misunderstand, a rating of 4 is a movie worth watching in my book, but where I would watch every episode of Arrow (on CW) and have read all the Hunger Games books, and watched the 2 movies (so far), I'll not be in this one for a re-run.

Along the way there are some interesting 'reveals' that were unexpected, but with hindsight there were a few hints to all the reveals along the way.  It is in the reveals that beg for a sequel. I don't really know where to go from there, but there is absolutely a sequel and if I were writing it, it would be better than the original.  I'd go for something along the Borne Identity range of ideas, toss in some awkward romance and it's a hit.

I did like the conclusion.  If you watch the movie it will be anti-climatical, and when it comes you'll know exactly the dialogue and actions that are to come, but I liked it anyway.",1401408000,,1626,4.156549520766773

People have been searching for Hanna and her father for years! Each day, her father continues her training in languages, martial arts, history, everything. One day, Hanna chose to press the homing beacon, and she is brought back to reality.

This movie is, basically, very violent chase scenes, one after the other. The audience is kept in the dark as to why Hanna is being chased. However, I found it easy to figure out. The big secret was not, to me, worth all the violence. Even the sound track oozed violence.

4596132,5,B0057GUD7C,"This is among my top ten favorite movies of all time.  There are many movies about young assassin trainees, at least one other involving a young girl (The Professional), but this kid really kills people, not just gets the opportunity then chickens out.  WARNING: PLOT REVELATION:  What I love is how believable it is that Hanna doesn't have ""normal"" social skills.  She grew up from infancy in a wilderness, knowing only her father.  He tries to prepare her for the world, but it can't be done.  This story is in no way a ""comedy"" but her absolute geekiness gives the story magnificent charm.  This part is very believable.  What touches on science fiction is that like dozens of other stories, Hanna is bred to be a super human.  BUT this doesn't take it too far--it's perhaps like the abilities in the Bourne series.  (If you consider that humans have only 1/4 the muscle mass to strength ratio of all other primates, it becomes believable that some genetic tweaking could easily make a ""Hanna."").............My only disappointment is that I bought a disc that had been a rental and it doesn't include the Bonus Features.  I will buy a New copy so I can see them.
  UPDATE: Now that I've seen the Bonus Features, I Love This Movie More. Here on Amazon & on IMDB.com many people's reviews point out ""errors"" which are exactly what the Director intended, although some Clarifications had to fall out in the Movie's Editing. Interestingly, the Director categorizes this as a ""Fairy Tale"" TYPE of story.  This explains some of the oddities. But his goal was to keep Special Effects to a minimum and instead have camera shots that gave the same Feeling to the audience. Examples, when Hanna and Rachel are facing each other in the van, both have the sun behind their back; when Hanna and Sophie are talking under a blanket, they keep flipping left and right in the screenshot. In the context of the scenes, all this is brilliant!  It's storytelling at its finest.",1389052800,4,1960,4.706744868035191

4596142,1,B0057GUD7C,"For months, the preview for Hanna played before everything I saw and to be honest it intrigued me. Unfortunately, it's just one of those film where all the good stuff is in the previews. Hanna is a special girl, wanted by The C.I.A., so since birth, her father hid her in a cabin in the North Pole. He trained her to be an ultimate weapon, to fight the people who sought her out, but as a result she had no idea about how the world worked. The only positive thing I could take away from this film was the performance of Saoirse Ronan, who was simply amazing. At 19, this girl isn't just a martial arts expert, but she speaks like a dozen languages. She is just as special and amazing as the character she was portraying and it's unfortunate that her skills were wasted in such a bomb of a movie. I don't think I've ever seen a slower moving, more boring action film in my life. Nothing is explained to you until much later on and by that point, you just really don't care anymore and want the film to be over. It's just one uncomfortable interaction after another, with seemingly no point, until the films disappointing climax. The actress was really talented and they could have done so much more with her, instead of putting her in a film, where she's running around like a chicken with her head cut off. I mean really, the story could not have been more thin and the supporting cast couldn't possibly have been any less helpful to the story.

The story moves around a lot, starting in the cold woods of the far north then moving to the desert and finally to some urban settings. This is one of those movies that doesnt' have a clear-cut ending but just sort of stops.

What was interesting to me about the movie is how well it works, as strange as it is. The music, the settings, the characters and the scenery all work with a surprising harmony to produce a film which creats a strong atmosphere and some sympathy and concern for Hanna and those who have befriended her.

This is a movie for the action movie fan and is sure to turn off the typical family film enthusiast. I would think it more suitable for adults and older teen-agers.",1378425600,,1008,4.408602150537634

Then you find out someone wants to kill her and it's up to her to choose the time and place for this showdown.  The story gets more and more bizarre.  In the end, she accomplishes what she set out to do but at such a price you wonder how she eventually ends up.  It's haunting.",1378252800,,484,4.1063829787234045

4596165,5,B0057GUD7C,"This is a raw, unblinking look into the stark world of a killing machine who, in ANY OTHER WORLD, would be a lovely teenager searching for a good college to attend; partying, hanging out...

Hanna's been trained by her father from the time she could walk to do things counterintuitive for a child: survival, extraction, immobilizing the enemy up to and including killing those who are dangerous to her (which consists of pretty much everyone on earth). She has a special nature (that is explained in the film) that allows her to be the very best at all her skills...and she takes to it like coyote-to-carrion.

One cannot help but be empathetic toward this woman/child; thus the movie has us on her side throughout the 111 minute run time.
Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett give their roles vibrancy. Blanchett's acting both with and against character...spooky role for her and she excels at it.

Terrific movie!",1377475200,,907,4.838709677419355

It takes until nearly the end of the film to find out why. The critical plot info is doled out in a trickle. Instead of adding to the suspense, this just makes it harder to connect with Hanna, her father, or their mutual enemy.  The movie would have been much better if they had just explained at the beginning why the father would raise his child like that. Eric Bana was good as the father. They missed a huge opportunity by making him virtual wallpaper. I usually love Cate Blanchett, but her southern accent was TERRIBLE. Just terrible. Finally, the ending was very abrupt. Boom, done.

4596176,2,B0057GUD7C,"I don't want to spoil anything so let me just say if you watch this movie with just a little critical thinking you are going to be disappointed. There are logical problems throughout. The characters are played as smart and quick thinking. The story is not. Watching a supposedly smart agent walk off into the tundra in a suit (rather than changing into a suit on the outskirts of civilization) is one of the first examples you will see of this... it just puts the characters at odds with the story. They just wouldn't be this dumb.

In addition, there are a few fairly crazy acid trip type scenes with edgy cinematography. It doesn't mix well into the movie in my opinion.",1376006400,2,672,4.508196721311475

Breath-taking as it is visually, it does have a major flaw.  The story just isn't there, especially in the third act.  If that were not so, I would place it in my top ten all-time favorites.  But even so, there is much to admire.  Enough for me to shell out for a blu-ray copy.  I will be watching it repeatedly for the visual feast, and for the title character's performance.",1375401600,,529,4.553191489361702
4596180,5,B0057GUD7C,"HANNA is a good action thriller starring Saoirse Ronan from ATONEMENT in the title role. The film begins with her hunting a reindeer in wintry Finland. She feels guilty about her arrow missing her prey's heart allowing it to suffer a slow death and quickly finishes off the job with a gun. (Spoiler Alert - This scene will be repeated at the end but you can see it coming a minute before.) We watch her performing her martial arts skills with her father Eric Bana who's also responsible for her encyclopedic education. Hanna is no ordinary teenager with her extraordinary survival skills as she seems like someone from another world, and we slowly learn why these two have been in hiding for years.

Meanwhile they become hunted by Cate Blanchett as a nasty CIA boss who knows the secret of Hanna's origin and forced them into hiding for years. Hanna and Dad separate to meet in Germany as now it's their turn to be the hunters of Cate who takes her role to heart as the Queen of Mean: Part Wicked Witch, part Ma Barker. You will enjoy this chilling performance probably more than the other two leads but that's not to undervalue them because villains always have the showiest parts. This is a balanced trio of good actors meeting the demands of the script: The father as teacher, the student who surpasses the teacher, and the principal who closed their 'school' and wants to eliminate them. Cate's henchmen are as nasty as her if not worse.

There's a fairy tale motif running through this survival story as well as plenty of action scenes of mortal combat, chases, and torture accompanied by a throbbing score by the Chemical Brothers. The secondary theme concerns the emotional awakening of a young teenaged girl who has been raised away from civilization and must now learn to interact with adults and a girl of her own age as well as with boys as Hanna discovers when she tags along with an English family in Morocco on her covert trek to Germany. Saoirse is convincing here as in her action scenes. It's these blending of genres and themes that makes HANNA a cut above the usual action thriller. Saoirse will amaze you in how she uses her expressionless face to mask her true feelings and Cate will give you a good scare in just about every one of her scenes.

This Blu-ray's visuals are very good in depicting the various locales and times of day but it's the DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack that surpasses them in quality to give your home theater's speakers and subwoofer a total workout with room shaking ability and startling surround effects. Dialogue is crisp and clear.",1375315200,,2583,4.647702407002188

4596183,4,B0057GUD7C,"The second film together of Saoirse Ronan and director Joe Wright help cement Saoirse's fame and status as a very talented actress.
To do a feat like that as an actor you need an uncommon role to play and Hanna is that for Saoirse.
Hanna like you can read in other reviews is a teenage girl living in isolation with her father in a frozen forest training to become a perfect assassin, in any other director's hands this would have been a standard and full of cliche action flick, the kind of action film where they like to show off the arsenal and big explosions, cool clothings, cool locations and big explosions again, with catchphrases like I'll be back,so all that is what this movie is not.

4596185,2,B0057GUD7C,"While there are some captivating action sequences (interrogation room), and overall a pretty cool plot, ultimately the movie fails to deliver. The numerous gaping plot holes, the director's overriding desire to evoke the air of a horror-flick, and dingy, bleak cinematography kill it as a fun-to-watch flick.

Overall:
Don't see this movie if you are looking for a snappy action/assassin/adventure movie. It's just too weird and unbelievable in a non-cool way.

See this movie if you are into fantasy action flicks that touch on the sentimental, or want a subtle action movie with a touch of creepy/horror, or especially if you are fond of Grimm's Fairy Tales (which I confess to have never read).",1374537600,,697,5.105263157894737

4596192,4,B0057GUD7C,"First, let me say that I did enjoy this movie. The acting was excellent and the soundtrack is wonderful. My problems were that the ""flow"" of the film was somewhat choppy and some of the characters needed to be fleshed out. The film gives very little background on Hanna's ""father"" and Marrissa. The same for the Grimm character. The British hippie family were done well, with an exceptionally good acting job by the young lady playing the daughter. I cannot say enough about the Chemical Brothers' soundtrack though. It is one of the things which makes the film work. The young actress playing Hanna was quite good too. All in all it is a worthy effort and I recommend it to fans of espionage films.",1373587200,,699,4.6

4596196,3,B0057GUD7C,"Lots of movies about enhanced warriors being black-listed and chased down.  Some work, like ""Bourne"" series but others just take the idea and re-work it until it is worked to death.  Hanna is wrong for LOT of reasons, not the least of which is that superbly trained operatives keep a superbly low profile - neither she nor dad were discrete at all.  For example, why was it necessary to send a signal to her arch-enemy to hunt her down?  Right from the start lots wrong.  Her escape from a top security facility - are we remembering some of ""Fifth Element"" and several biological disaster films here?  (I missed the lasers trying to zap her as she was maneuvering through the a/c ducts, etc.)  How or why did a top government agency have such psychopaths available to assist in tracking down the father/daughter?  Slightly better movie than ""Hansel and Gretel"" but it really doesn't work well when a 98 lb waif succeeds so well so often against so many who are so skilled and experienced.  Think of female gymnasts as much better examples of what believable, incredibly trained operatives would look like.",1373155200,2,1105,4.7434554973821985

4596204,4,B0057GUD7C,"The story here is excellent. What better than a teenage girl as the protagonist in an action thriller! I enjoyed the story immensely. For the most part I enjoyed the video; the quality is top notch, but some of the camera shots are a bit dizzying and disconcerting. I realize it's meant to heighten the emmotional pull of the movie, but let the story do the work. It's not like the new thing of using the 'Blair Witch Project' technique of the hand-held amateur camera shot that really turns me off.
If you haven't seen the movie, it's a great action thriller. I don't know how the bluray quality compares to the dvd, but it's quite awesome! I did enjoy the alternate ending and interview with Ronan. There are quite a few extras if you're into that thing. (All listed elsewhere.)

You wonder how she is so capable, and that's the beauty of this nearly flawless script. We learn a little at a time who she really is, and her origins. The soundtrack is a little funky for some, but Hanna is a bizarre little girl raised in the tundra without benefit of modern conveniences (like electricity), but given the benefit of a super-charged education, fighting, and survival skills. She's short on social skills, which provides us with the needed humorous interludes between the intense action scenes. At one point she's asked by the mother of a family she kicks around with for a time, ""What did your die from?"" ""Three bullets,"" Hanna answers.

Nothing very exciting about the movie. The plot isn't explained until the end and in my opinion was not done well.

For a better film involving a young woman taking out the bad guys, you may want to try Luc Besson's ""Columbiana.""  While that film wasn't perfect either, it has a far better plot and was much more interesting than Hanna.",1363910400,,614,4.700934579439252

Even her double in the holding cell (Downton Abbey's Mary) can't do the accent at all & the result is laughable. The whole movie (minus the beginning) is entertaining, but there are many plot holes that leave you asking questions that should have been answered in the film. Its strongest aspect is the young protagonist, whose accent didn't bother me.

And don't forget the ever-growing body count!

It is an odd premise, and there are some odd characters and quirky situations.  It is, however, an interesting tale, and you can get a feel for the puzzlement Hanna feels as she learns about the world beyond her forest home. . .but somebody needs to teach that kid about hair conditioner!!!",1363478400,,982,4.713450292397661

Choices like: being a ruthless killer and not having a weapon when you know you would be needing one, and choices like running away from your victim when you know you have the upper hand in position and firepower. There are too many other sloppy directorial choices to mention.  The writers also added ""filler"" and scenes, that so contrast with the theme and the plot, they continually ""throw"" you out of the movie and make you constantly reminded that ""Hollywood"" was very much in play during the whole production of this thing.  You can just see it going through the actors' minds:  ""Oh, my God, he wants me to do what now?"" What sophomoric writers came up with this script?

Saoirse Ronan plays Hanna and does a terrific job.  It's almost like the screenwriters have amalgamated the characteristics of Jean Luc Besson's two heroines and infused her with some bada** Uma Thurman Kill Bill moves...I admit that I had some trepidation when I watched the trailer - which looked a little far fetched - a kid in an action role?  But the film is utterly convincing as Hanna kicks some serious i-can't-say-the-word-on-Amazon.

With strong casting and support from Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett (it's getting a bit ""old"" that Cate gets casted in the baddie roles again and again but she's still compelling)...director Joe Wright has made a very nice action film that trumps a lot of Hollywood fodder any day.  The film has a heart too, which is nice.  Adding a few quirky David Lynch touches here and there, Hanna is a very well made, stylish thriller.

Lead actress Saoirse (whose name is difficult to spell and pronounce) has a future in the movies, for sure.  I'm not expecting a sequel,but that would be nice...",1361923200,,1176,4.758620689655173

Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana, and Cate Blanchett, and Tom Hollander are all stand-outs in their roles but the actors who played the quirky but unfortunate that befriends Hanna are excellent.

It is clear what their fate is in the movie but apparently the studio told the director to avoid highlighting their fate. A much better and much more interesting conclusion would have been to have had the their daughter save them by after having learned from Hanna in much the same way that Hanna learned from her.

I mean, originally I recorded it but then I was so impressed with the first quarter hour or so that I bought it and couldn't wait for it to come. That'll teach me caution! For the moment I'm landing on the three-star option because I DID really like WATCHING most of it just because it is visually sumpuous, as are the three leading actors, all of whom are also gifted and captivating. At the same time, though, I'm close to agreeing with a one-star reviews that advised viewers to turn off the TV when Hanna flips the switch to let her whereabouts be known to the Wicked Witch. The only reason I'm not in full agreement is that the Witch is played by Blanchett and I enjoyed every scene that she is in. I also agree with a one-star review that scolds the movie, or the heroine, for wasting time and energy beating up her merely mortal father, Eric Bana, when there are actual villains out there. Coming-of-age film or not, this spoiled brat should have learned to control her temper by now! More seriously, the film should have made up its mind whether it is a thriller with a teenage girl as assassin, which would had my vote, or science fiction with a mystery element, or a coming-of-age saga with a heroine who has does have some unusual issues to deal with, or a fairy tale. I confess to a bias against modern fairy tales because they lack the bite and complexity of the originals, but certainly I've found exceptions. This is not one, and every time a Disney element intrudes here -- and Disney bullplop dominates the last third of the film -- my husband and I groaned aloud.

Sometimes had its odd bits like Hanna and her friend kissing, and the unbelievable Internet search Hanna did (raised by ""father"" to get revenge but taught nothing of computers and web searching yet she does brilliantly anyway?) yet Saorise Ronan did an excellent job with what must've been a hard role to perform.
I didn't like the way the viewer is just left hanging as to Hanna's future, the alternate ending in which she returns to her Arctic cabin home helped that only a little.

Cate Blanchett does a great job in her hard-edge spymaster role. Eric Bana plays a minor part in the drama, however large his part in getting the plot under way. Saoirse Ronan, however, walks away with the title role. Her delicate features and lean grace seem at odds with her vicious role, and the director makes the most of that contradiction. The paradox only builds when Hanna connects with another young girl - the contrast of one girl's chatty, knowing daydreams with the other's gritty and uncertain nightmares might make you look at any girl differently, knowing that both extremes might lie within one young frame.

Think of a kitten: cute, yes, but trained by its parents to kill. Hanna is that kind of kitten.

I kid of course.  But that might have made for a more interesting movie.  I don't know.  This movie is about Johanna (Saoirse Ronan, doing a good job playing her part as a wide-eyed naif who has learned about but not experienced the world), a young teenage girl who has been trained to be a super soldier ostensibly in order to assassinate the woman who killed her mum and will kill her if she were to learn of her existence (Kate Blanchett, wearing a cropped red wig that rather suits her, and dropping in and out of a southern, Texas-style accent which is very distracting).  Hanna's educated and deadly father (Eric Bana as Erik Heller) trains her in the arctic, in a harsh environment devoid of distraction and requiring individual determinedness, self-reliance, and focus in order to survive.  When Hanna is ready to venture out on her quest and put her training to the test she crosses paths with not only her nemesis but also a contract killer and a free-roaming hippie British family, the daughter of which becomes Hanna's friend.  In the end Hanna learns who she is and why she is...a disturbing revelation that doesn't seem to hit her that hard and, because of how the movie ends (much like it started...I won't give it away) we are left to wonder what will happen to the girl.

What makes this movie unique is not its female protagonist but her potential in the face of her lack of wordly experience.  There is a scene where she comes into contact with a variety of electrical items (light, fan, TV, coffepot) and it overwhelms her and she doesn't know what to do.  The scene is not played for comedy and has an unusual and memorable feel to it.  She also has some normalish teenage experiences with a Brit girl that befriends her and there is some tenderness played in these scenes.  Saoirse has a natural beauty that is on display and looks appropriately young, that is until she is put into light makeup, and then she looks like she's about to turn 20.  Also unique is the ending that takes place in a closed down theme park that feels surreal.  Blanchett's villain, Marissa Weigler, is dubious in that you can understand how she is the villain and yet at the same time the writers don't give her an underhanded verve or style with which to play off of and Blanchett doesn't manage a convincing style on her own.

There is also a lot going on with Kates character but we are only given snippets and no explanation of all the little quirks in her life.

4596343,2,B0057GUD7C,"In the past week or so, I've come across several lists of the toughest chicks in fiction. Some of these were for chicks in movies. Some for television. Some for both. Some from literature. None of these lists included Hanna, and for that, I think they are all lacking. Yes, even the literature lists should have included Hanna; she's that kick butt! In fact, she's so kick butt, I'm sure that that's where that movie came from. Someone said, ""Hey! Let's make a movie about a young girl that can kick butt like no body's business!""

Someone else tried to ruin  the party by saying, ""But, wait, why can she kick so much butt?""

And that's where it all fell apart.

The movie, Hanna, is strung together on the very thinnest of plots. I mean Run, Lola, Run thin, but that one works better, because that's all the movie's supposed to be about. But the makers of Hanna, evidently, wanted the movie to appear as if it contains substance, so they tried to write a story as to why Hanna can and does kick so much butt. And I say makers, because I have no idea who might be at fault for this ill-conceived notion. Was it just bad writing from the start? Did the director dispense with the story in favor of the action? Did the producers demand it? Also, speaking of Lola, and I didn't time it, but I would guess somewhere close to 1/3 of Hanna is actually just music video of (mostly) her just running. Or crawling. Being chased, at any rate. Sometimes it's Erik.

Having said all of that, if you like a good action flick and don't need much story, it's a great movie. My friend, who took me to see it, certainly liked it much better than I did. The fight scenes are well done, and there's plenty of suspense wrapped up in the action. And running. Lots of running. And I bet the director or the writer or someone thought they were being very clever by wrapping the movies ending up in a circle to tie it back to the opening. Oh, but wait, I'm letting my antipathy for the story slip back in there.

The biggest issue with the story is that it resorts to the ""big reveal"" in order to explain the story all at once because it failed to provide the viewers with enough information as the movie progressed to figure anything out on  their own. Really, I hate this. Especially since they could have allowed us the information throughout the movie by cutting out 10 minutes of running.

There was one other very positive aspect of Hanna: the acting. Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett are both excellent. In fact, they are the two characters that give the movie any sort of depth and weight. Saoirse Ronan (Hanna) does a fine job, but I haven't seen her in anything else, so I'm not sure if it was acting ability or just the way she is.",1346025600,,2714,4.349802371541502

But, once the action starts, it never did stop! I was totally glued to the set! Most scenes were fast paced and action oriented - the way I like an action movie to turn out. The screen shots were mostly well directed with clear angles.

Bloopers in the movie:

(1) the fight scene with the skinhead at the container docks where I didn't detect fake blood being used.

(2) the scene where her host family was held hostage with no follow-up news of them at the end of the movie.

(3) At least 1 primary bad guy wasn't killed in the end - that evil blonde man.

Is there going to be a sequel to this movie? I sure hope so!

NOTE:  THIS REVIEW HAS NO SPOILERS!

As played by Saoirse Ronan, Hanna is an enigmatic killing machine who is as cold and barren as the arctic environment in which she is raised by her father, Erik Heller.  An ex-CIA operative himself, he's given her everything he can: martial arts training, encyclopedic knowledge, fluency in several languages, and most of all a place to hide away from the forces who have been looking for her all of her life, to (at best) study her, or to (at worst) kill her.

She's had the option to leave her father's ""care"" ever since he deemed her ready: all she has to do is touch a button.  And as our movie just barely starts, she does--and we're in for a wild ride from here on in.

You would be excused for thinking this is another in the ""Bourne"" sub-genre of movies: a highly trained but unknowing (i.e. ""innocent"") operative is left to fend for herself against the murderous intentions of equally skilled assassins gunning for her.  How many times have we seen this trope played out?

I can't tell you that this one is truly different--to be sure, there ARE differences, and I think you'll discover them without my spoiling it for you here.  But what I did like was the concept that, for Hanna, almost EVERYTHING was a discovery: people, society, our cultures, and most of all music.  It was all new, all magnificent, but she was so inundated by it all that any one thing was hard to register.  Imagine being thrown into a blender and being told to pick out a chocolate chip...it's almost impossible.

One thing she has to deal with, perhaps above all, is just who SHE is.  Hanna knows she's being hunted, and she has been trained for this.  But exactly why has never been appropriately spelled out.  And in this sense everyone is an enemy or at least a suspect, not the least of all those who are closest to her.

""Hanna,"" is directed by Joe Wright, whose previous works--""Atonement,"" ""Pride and Prejudice,"" and ""The Soloist""--clue us in to the notion that there is going to have to be something sophisticated here.  Wright's works do not bespeak a director of action films.  But Wright does indeed do a great job of handling the quick cut/fast moving battle scenes, including one incredible continuous scene in which the camera follows Eric Bana (as Hanna's father Erik) as he exits a bus, travels through the station, along a street, down an escalator into a subway station and into an open area in which he is forced to battle four hired assassins--ALL IN ONE UNBROKEN SHOT!!  All of this while the camera literally swirls around him as he walks, descends, and fights; it's absolutely fluid, and absolutely amazing.

What Wright brings to the film is an unspoken intelligence, a way of setting this action flick in a more intellectual plane.  I think it's possible to follow a metaphorical slant here, too:  the film has a depth to it that goes beyond bullets and knives.  Follow the line ""I just missed the heart,"" if you want a clue.

What struck me about Hanna was how perfect the young actress playing her was.  Saoirse Ronan is extraordinary as the girl trained to be, well, extraordinary.  Her blonde hair, her pale Irish complexion...it all makes for a blank canvas as yet unwritten upon at the movie's start.  And, while she is this innocent young teenager, she is also a fearsome killing machine, more capable than anyone could know, except perhaps the father who trained her.

Eric Bana deserves credit too in his role as the father.  He portrays a man who is torn by his duty as an ex-operative, and protecting the daughter he has, as well as the history, the fate, that is foisted upon her.

But it is Cate Blanchett who really acts the hell out of her role.  She is a red-headed terror on two feet, alternately cold-blooded and yet strangely fashion conscious, cruel and fastidious.  But then again, the other killers we see are strange, too...very strange.  They make the particular sub-strata occupied by these horrendous beings one you would be quite obviously best to avoid, one where killing is merely a highly specialized job.

I liked ""Hanna"" and recommend it.  There is certainly room for a sequel, and I would find it an interesting proposition.  What Hanna might become, given her shall we say unusual upbringing, would be anyone's guess.",1337472000,3,4301,4.672872340425532
4596365,4,B0057GUD7C,"I did not know what to expect when I purchased this movie.  I was pleasantly surprised once I watched it.  Great action, but a rather strange plot.",1336867200,2,147,4.407407407407407
4596366,4,B0057GUD7C,"Even though much of the plot could've been deduced merely from watching the very publicized trailer for the film and the plotline at times requires one to utter lose their disbelief, rather than merely suspending it, I actually was entertained by Hanna, in spite of the obvious flaws that other reviewers have pointed out. Movies fall into two camps that I will define as popcorn-entertainment verses artistic storytelling that tugs at your heartstrings. Hanna falls into the first category without a doubt. It was very aesthetically beautiful, I want their cinematographer if I ever do a film. I felt the music fit the action sequences well, even if the action itself was suspect.

Hanna is an interesting take of the coming of age story mixed with elements of Huxley's Brave New World-the notion of creating perfect soldiers like Hanna drawing parallels with the creation of these pleasure seeking drug addicted ones found in Brave New World. The problem is that I'm not sure we haven't seen this movie somewhere before, and as Ezra Pound once said ""Make it New."" To question further, the alternative ending might have been a better fit, than the uh, okay, what now ending we got. For my entertainment, I'll go four stars.",1336521600,2,1224,4.913043478260869

Solid performance from the young actress who you really will cheer on from the start and love.",1336262400,,429,4.375
4596369,3,B0057GUD7C,"(Three and a half)

The last movie I saw by the same director was Atonement, and it left a similar feeling with me that Hanna did where the story is pretty bland, but the visuals/sounds are fantastic. Well this bourne knockoff is more of the same, although it definately has more entertainment value than Atonement. The premise is very basic that would normally make for your typical bland PG-13 'thriller' that gets pinched out every couple of weeks but not in this case, Hanna is very European flavored which makes it more of an oddity.

The story is Hanna's living with her dad in the middle of nowhere (I think they were in Greenland) and he's teaching her very extreme survival methods, and tells her that whenever she's ready (not sure for what exactly) to push a comical red button. When she does she get's captured by the CIA(I think?) and escapes, with an agency on her tail, and all sorts of life lessons for Hanna are learned between each ass kicking. I've seen this movie about three times now and the story has vague parts that have me still scratching my head.

I went into this movie knowing nothing more than the cover so it was kind of a cool suprise that this wasn't Joan of Arc or something, that it took place in modern times, but when the story starts going along there's a lot of dumb action cliches you see (for example when she grabs onto the bottom of a truck going like 60mph in the middle of the rugged desert). A couple of things in the movie were just pretty bizarre as well, like the German bounty hunter who's played out to be some sadistic badass gets his ass whooped in like 2 seconds, the out-of-leftfield lesbian moment, and the British family that Hanna tags along with meet a suprisingly gruesome fate for a PG-13 movie. The ending is kind of abrupt too but I liked how it went full circle.

So that's all the bad things about Hanna out of the way, lets talk about the good things, the shots are great, the cinematography was excellent as the film took you all over the place. The acting was alright, nothing really incredible but the kids weren't lousy actors this time which was nice. The visuals get pretty surreal at parts too, especially at the old hippie guy's house which was interesting. Some of the shots are simply brilliant as well, the strongest anti-piracy message I've ever seen was simply the subway fight scene, the build up, the music, the subtle visual cues, and of course the lightning fast choreography, all of it was fantastic.

I'm also a big Chemical Brother's fan, but strangely enough didn't know they did the soundtrack until after I saw the movie, and I'd say they did a great job with the soundtrack. They didn't overdo their role by just adding more dance songs but actually did atmosphere which worked out great for them, to this day I still can't get 'The Devil's in the Details' out of my head.

So Hanna's a rather strange Euro-action film, it wants so bad to be your typical American action film and yet it's just so weird that it can't be, and I suspect that it has a strong cult following since it wasn't a huge hit with normal audiences. That being said if you have an appreciation for styalized film, than you will enjoy Hanna, just don't put too much thought into the story. Another interesting thing is when I saw Hanna for the second time enebriated and the experience was much more rewarding with the brain turned off. Let's hope next time Joe Wright hires a better screen writer though.",1336176000,,3466,4.511146496815287

4596374,4,B0057GUD7C,"First, I liked this movie, and violated my $10 limit rule for blu-ray (having paid $14 total) to buy it.
For the full story line, go to wikipedia.
Like most have said, the pace and setup was excellent until Hanna pulls the locator switch, then it drags a bit.
Seeing Hanna as an involuntary 16-year old Jason Bourne character who is also coming-at-age was, to say the least, an interesting story line.

If you keep several points in mind, you'll find the movie more creditable and enjoyable.  Her DNA was altered to eliminate compassion, pity, etc. and make her stronger with increased mental focus, so 90 lbs of Hanna Heller equals 1 grown up Jason Bourne.

She kills in self defence, and I have to admit, while I cheered for her, knocking off CIA operatives who should be chasing down Al-Qaeda terrorists instead, had me conflicted.  But those CIA operatives were scum of the earth while the soldiers were pawns who would kill tribal leaders while hunting insurgents; it is after all, a rogue operation which is why Marissa hires Isaacs (""Why do you want me?""  Marissa: ""The CIA won't let me do some things"", or something like that).
Many viewers couldn't accept the ""reason"" for the 14-year hunt for Eric & Hanna Heller, but the same story line exists with 3 Jason Bourne movies so just believe that if the CIA wants you dead, they won't forget.  It is a bit weak as Marissa, 14 years ago, seems to be just a field assassin.  Marissa looks hot, and would probably bother a lot of male spymasters.

Right after her escape from the CIA compound in the middle of the No. African desert (does Morocco know about it), Hanna comes in contact with everyday life and real people for the first time after leaving the Finland artic cocoon.  The Spanish boy will now learn not to grab girls inappropriately.  It also humanizes her for the audience, and you want her to win and thrive, I did, at least.
At the end, everybody dies but Hanna  . . . horray, but what becomes of her ?  bleeding from a bullet in her side, and ""father"" and grandmother also dead.  Where does she go, and who is going to mentor her towards emotional maturity.  I wanted a little more sugar, and I'll see if my 11-year old daughter can get some Hanna training before the boys arrive.",1333670400,,2250,4.523456790123457
4596375,4,B0057GUD7C,"If you thought this was a movie, you were disappointed.  The director's sole intention was to match surreal images to the Chemical Brothers soundtrack.  No money was wasted on the script.",1333497600,,187,5.0
4596376,3,B0057GUD7C,"Last night's bargain rack movie was ""Hanna."" To me, this was not a very good movie. Where can I begin? Let's start with the best. The photography was excellent, especially the far north shots from Finland. The rest was good also, but I really liked the frozen north. Beautiful and well done! Also, before I watched the movie, I noticed that the music was by the Chemical Brothers. The Chemical Brothers? One of my favorite electronic acts? They're doing movies? Well, this I had to hear so my ears, at least, were open throughout the movie. I'd say it only barely sounded like the Chemical Brothers, but it was a well done musical score.

Alas, now the movie. It was unmitigated nonsense. There's no other way to put it. How does Hollywood come up with stuff like this? A young woman was raised in the far north of the Finland wilds to be a trained killer and aimed at a target. Alas, she was tough, to be sure, but quite a charming young lady. Miscast? I'd say so! In any case, she escapes a planned raid on the Arctic Circle hideout and emerges from a man-hole in a subtropical desert at least 3000 miles away. Trust me. I'm a geologist. Now, does this strain credibility or what? The desert looked like an obscure part of the Colorado Plateau of the Western U. S., but the local quickly changed to North Africa. Alas, I'm already having trouble following this story. Then we find her amazed with electricity and in awe of lights and fans and things of that sort. Okay, it's understandable, considering her raising. However, a few minutes later, we find her using a computer search engine to track down her father. Alas, this is a story I just can' follow. There are so many interlaced credibility gaps that the whole story makes no sense whatsoever. Let's cut it short. She finally kills her target. There!

The whole movie is just a fiasco. CIA agents everywhere. People getting killed by the dozens. Chase scenes overlapping chase scenes. Well, there's enough action that boredom doesn't set in but the story has no credibility at all. Fortunately, there was some interesting music and the photography was good.

4596377,4,B0057GUD7C,"Starring a child or adolescent in any kind of action movie is a gamble, but to place them in an outspokenly serious one is a decisively dangerous risk. The best we've done so far is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ralph-Macchio/dp/B0008JIJ2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ralph Macchio</a>, of whom there is one for every half-dozen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankie-Munizes/dp/B00009QG6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankie Munizes</a>. However, ""Hanna"" - the fourth film and action debut of director Joe Wright (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Atonement/dp/B0013XZ6X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Atonement</a>) - strikes preciously rare ground in making teenager Saoirse Ronan believable as well as entertaining to a mature audience. It's definitely not everyman's action flick - a great deal of its strength relies on its genre-bending structure of thriller and bildungs motifs - but as someone who looks at all action fare with a skeptical eye, I can wholeheartedly recommend this one to whomever can approach it with an open mind.

The story: Hanna (Ronan), a 16-year-old raised by her father (Eric Bana,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Munich/dp/B000F1IQN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Munich</a>) in isolation to be the perfect assassin, is dispatched on a mission across Europe to kill a ruthless intelligence agent deadset on her capture (Cate Blanchett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-trilogy/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings trilogy</a>).

I admit, I had to watch this film more than once to begin appreciating it. The story (written by first-timer Seth Lochhead) thrives on ambiguity - the ambiguity of Hanna's true origin and that of the strange triangle between her, her father, and Cate Blanchett's character. Additionally, the globetrotting nature of the plot confused me, as the film goes from Finland to Morocco to Spain and finally Germany with the utmost nonchalance; the first transition is particularly jarring, making it feel as though we're entering a dream scene when Hanna suddenly enters a palm resort amidst camels and folks in robe and turbans. To counter potential discomfort with these aspects, you just need to remain alert and not expect the locations to pop up in text on the screen. The payoff of this is that you get to better enjoy a cast of surprisingly interesting characters: Hanna of course is always nice to watch in her ongoing introduction to society, and Cate Blanchett's deceptively complicated CIA-witch is more intriguing every time you watch her; additionally, Hanna tags along with a quirky bohemian family for some weirdly sweet scenes, and all the while she's pursued by a trio of German enforcers led by Tom Hollander (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-Dead-Man-s-Chest/dp/B00005JP0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</a>) who for all the world could have jumped out of a Luc Besson or Quentin Tarantino picture.

The action isn't overly abundant, but when it occurs, it's just the way I like it: up close & personal, with a good deal of martial arts but no explosions or car chases. Normally, I'd take account of the fact that none of the performers here are legitimate martial artists, but instead, I consider the movie an accomplishment for fight choreographer Jeff Imada (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Ultimatum/dp/B000VWYJ86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Ultimatum</a>), who's got a knack for making non-fighters look legitimate without the need of stunt doubles. It helps that the fights are all pretty realistic: the five exchanges are relatively few and far between, but they stand out for their convincing design, full of counter-strikes and a few judo maneuvers. My personal favorite (the subway brawl) doesn't include Saoirse Ronan at all, but she's still a highlight when you see her taking on opponents larger than herself and overcoming them without needing them to feint blows or over-sell a strike. I'll admit, the fights aren't mind-blowing, but I honestly couldn't believe that I was watching the skinny shrimp from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lovely-Bones/dp/B001QOGYAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lovely Bones</a>&nbsp;the first time I saw her tussle. I have no reason to believe that Ronan will remain a regular of the action genre, and darnit I'm disappointed - this girl could outdo Cynthia Rothrock, given time and opportunity.

My major qualm with the film is its ending: it doesn't so much sneak up on you as just end - it's like if&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars/dp/B000FQJAIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars</a>&nbsp;had gone to the credits right after everyone had escaped the Death Star for the first time. Maybe this is to set up a sequel, but it's still pretty disappointing if you've gotten as involved in the movie as I have. With that said, I'd be the first in line to see this hypothetical sequel, if I knew it were anything as good as this. ""Hanna"" isn't a film I'd use to introduce a complete newcomer to the action genre, but it'd definitely be on my list to demonstrate how diverse of stars and vehicles you can expect to find.",1332892800,,5551,6.252287581699346
4596378,4,B0057GUD7C,"Many others have covered the plot and various details of the movie, so I will just say that I enjoyed it immensely - the stylish action (and apparently I'm enough of a film geek that I did exclaim with glee at the extended camera take of the scene with Erik going through the train station) was dazzling and Ronan does a great job. As much as a slender teen girl could possibly convince me that she is kicking full grown men's asses, she did. I do agree that the ending fell a bit flat, though it wasn't bad and had an appropriate parallel to the beginning.

Hanna's journey in the movie is both external and internal, and just like in the best books, they reflect each other. Hanna has had an amazingly unique upbringing in which she learns and does things most youths her age will never know or experience. Much of the knowledge is superficial facts though, as her drone like recitation of her cover story shows. She can speak fluently in several languages and say that she's from Leipzig and has friends named Rudy & Gunter but she has no real idea what that means because she has never known any friends and sounds robotic when reciting the story. Physically she's unbelievably capable, but emotionally and socially she's limited at best. Thematically the film is as much about this internal journey to discover her humanity as it is about the external journey to evade Marissa's team and eventually avenge her mother. There are obviously some parallels to Luc Besson's movie Leon with Natalie Portman as another young woman assassin, but I also see parallels to Blade Runner and its story of outsiders - Rutger Hauer's Roy Baty character and his fellow replicants - trying to reclaim their humanity. (Hanna and BR also feature quite compelling visual styles and electronic scores for more parallels.)",1332201600,,1805,4.73015873015873
4596379,3,B0057GUD7C,"A stylish, ""assassin-coming-of-age"" thriller (and who doesn't like one of those) has the ingredients for a good movie - interesting locations (snowy northern European woodlands, Morocco, Spain and Berlin); talented actors Cate Blanchett, Eric Bana, and fresh-faced newcomer, Saorise Ronin.  The plot, however, fell apart (IMHO) in the first ten minutes, and it was best to sit back and watch Hanna kick ass and run from her pursuers than wonder why Cate agreed to a supporting role ( maybe they let her keep the shoes).  The main problem?  WHY, after taking Hanna into hiding training in survival skills and fighting techniques  for fifteen? years,  (to combat Miranda and the defunct secret gov't prenatal DNA research program that seeks to eliminate her, did 'Papa Eric' encourage her to press the goverment ELT locator button for a rescue (knowing it would bring the very people she wanted to avoid), rather than simply hiking out, as Eric did?  (Wearing, I might add, a suit!  Not his arctic fur garments; a suit, without even an overcoat.  One would have to conclude there was a village close by; if he could make it, so could she, so calling the plane/heli made no  sense whatsoever.

The net effect after watching was that the movie appeared to be conceived as a vehicle to showcase Saorise Ronin.  See Hanna Run.  I did, and she was delightful, as a fresh-faced, unspoiled, virginal assassin.  I just hope she doesn't move to Hollywood and befriend Lindsey Lohan.",1331856000,,1570,5.011583011583012
4596380,5,B0057GUD7C,"Hanna is a young girl raised by her ex-CIA father to be almost a wolf-child.  They live in the snowy wastes of Finland, she kills reindeer with an arrow, she learns Ninja moves and multiple languages.

She is a survivalist in the forest and also in civilization.

At her own request, she is rudely transported to ""civilization""--the deserts of Morocco, underground prisons, the dregs of Berlin, all to kill a woman who has killed her mother and who will kill her if she can (played by Cate Blanchett).

Her father, meanwhile, goes on the same quest separately.

The real heart of the movie, however, is Hanna's process of becoming human.  She learns, awkwardly and painfully, to let some other people into her life (a roving family of hippies).

All of this is plausible and even beautiful.

Saoirse Ronan is wonderful as Hanna.  She can switch from innocent to terrifying in a moment, yet always retains her fey ethereality.  Eric Bana is also good.

Cate Blanchett is good in the role, but, amazingly, has an atrocious accent.  Blanchett is one of the best actors in the world, and her accents are usually perfect (see ""Aviator""), but here the accent is awful.  She is trying for Southern U.S., but it slides around and clanks and never really hits it.

But that's a small defect.

4596387,4,B0057GUD7C,"HANNA is a great example of a film where style and attitude trumps (or nearly) substance and logic. It's a super-cool looking movie that feels like it is better than it really is.

Young Saoirse Ronan (ATONEMENT, THE LOVELY BONES) gives an MVP performance as a teen-age killer. Raised since she was a baby by Erik (Eric Bana) her father in the middle of what looks like northern Finland...she knows almost nothing of how life works in the civilized world. Growing up in a wild, snow-shrouded environ, Erik has taught her everything she needs to know about hand-to-hand combat, firearms, bows & arrows, etc., as well as given her an education in languages and practically encouraged her to memorize an encyclopedia. Erik, you see, is a former CIA agent who is on the run from his bosses, because he ""knows too much"" about some nefarious and unsavory program. He's raising Hanna to be able to survive on her own, because one day, he knows they'll be separated and she needs to be prepared to fight her way to freedom.

That day comes when Hanna insists she's ready to live in the real world. So Erik pulls out a homing beacon that basically tells his pursuers exactly where to find him and when they show up, Erik has already fled, but Hanna turns herself over to them. It's never explained why they feel they must take such a loud, noisy, bloody re-entry into society...except that apparently it's worth risking both their lives to try to kill Erik's former boss/handler, Marissa (Cate Blanchett).

Hanna DOES escape, in grand style, and begins her journey to reunite with her father. Along the way, she is befriended by various colorful ""ordinary"" people and we see how ill-prepared Hanna is to interact with society. She's smart & dangerous, but also touchingly helpless and nave. She is pursued by some nasty characters (this movie does NOT make Germans or Germany look very appealing) as she flees from Morocco to Berlin.

A few folks have compared Ronan to the killer girl played by Chloe Grace-Moretz in KICK-A**...but they similarities are very slender. Moretz was a fast -and-foul talking little sparkplug, world-wise and eager to pile up bodies. Hanna is slow to speech and is wild-eyed and wondering at the world.

This is Ronan's movie and she totally steals it. She is a totally striking figure, in her nearly white hair and white eyebrows, with piercing eyes. But she continues to amaze as an actress as well...totally convincing as a killer, but also believable as just a teenager who has led a sheltered life. This character is very interesting & engaging, and we root for her.

Bana is fairly bland, but the role is bland. Blanchett is over-the-top, and proves once and for all (after INDIANA JONES) that she is NOT cut out to play a cartoonish villainess. She puts on a terrible Southern accent and gives a performance utterly without menace. I normally love her, but she was quite terrible in HANNA. (I did enjoy Tom Hollander as the primary assassin chasing Hanna. He brought a convincing level of creepiness to his performance.)

Director Joe Wright uses his exotic locations well and stages some nifty little action scenes. There are a lot of shots of Hanna simply running with great urgency, but they reminded me of Franka Potente in RUN LOLA RUN...gripping in their simplicity.

But behind the style, I found a frustrating plot. Motivations were often sketchy. Characters behaved in ways that didn't entirely make sense. The bad guys seemed more adept at crossing the globe than was reasonable. And this is one of those films where MANY innocent people die so that just two people can live. Hanna and her father are not important enough to justify the deaths and torturing of so many others...especially folks who befriend Hanna only to die painfully later.

And the climax of the film lacks punch. The best action sequences come early. I know the end is supposed to have more emotional heft, but because we don't really care that much about the Blanchett & Bana, the lack of a really spectacular climactic chase or battle really left me with a deflated feeling when the credits began to roll.

But the character of Hanna and the performance of Ronan make the movie worth seeing. She is a terrific young actress and has thoroughly embraced her untraditional character. I wouldn't even mind seeing another Hanna movie...keep the visual style and cool locations, but give Hanna some really interested characters to interact with.",1330905600,,4449,4.83442838370565
4596388,3,B0057GUD7C,"Hanna is a slightly different spin concerning action storylines where the good guy has to run from the bad guy.  In this case the ""good guy"" is a powerful assassin who's actually a little blonde-haired girl.  She can kick butt and take no names, and even defeat upwards of 5 or 6 operatives at the same time who possess their own special abilities and gun-wielding ways.  With that said, this isn't *quite* a Matrix-style film.  It's close to it, however.

Unfortunately there's two reasons I'm not particularly thrilled with the end result.  The first reason is that the beginning, at least the first 20 minutes, is quite confusing.  You're totally unsure what's going on- all you know is that a little girl is in the middle of a snowy forest and is an extraordinary fighter of sorts.  It's unclear what's going on until... well, without spoiling what happens, until she makes a critical, life-changing decision.  This *dramatically* changes the direction of the storyline and then begins to make perfect sense.

The other reason this film is average at best is the fact that the little girl is supposed to be running from a group of operatives who try desperately to contain the girl but... a good chunk of the storytelling doesn't actually focus on the running but instead focuses on the girls friendship with another girl she meets out in the desert, and this takes up a really big chunk of the movie.  At least 45 minutes of it.  It's pretty excessive to me.

However the 3 stars means I DID like Hanna overall.  The segments where Hanna unleashes her special butt-kicking talents on anyone she sees fit (and I mean *anyone*, haha) are easily the parts of the film that impress me the most.  It's not a gripping storyline by any means, and I'd say it's even lackluster for the most part, but at least the final 25 minutes is really suspenseful.  Oh and the description is actually correct.  It IS part adventure/part suspense.  This means kids might find it too violent, but the language is hardly ever extreme.  Not much (if any) swearing for example.

Overall, had about 30 minutes of the film been trimmed I believe would have benefited the film.  I would have then given the movie a higher rating.",1330732800,,2206,4.692708333333333

As the movie goes on you learn who they are and little bits of information are fed to you here & there. But even knowing what we are told, it still doesn't really explain the entire story. With a fragmented storyline, it was hard to really enjoy the movie. The actress that played Hanna was wonderful. Some of the fight scenes were a little hard to believe. They look choreographed & it was hard to believe she was doing any real damage to grown men. If they had concentrated more on her brains & speed, it would have been more realistic.

Plot/premise:  A (German?) government agency does some DNA altering on embryos to make stronger, smarter, healthier ""soldiers"".  Then pulls the plug and kills off all the evidence - except for baby Hanna and agent Erik who get away (Hanna's mother is killed in the escape).  Erik who is NOT her biological father, hid Hanna in the wilderness and taught her physical survival skills and educated her including teaching her multiple languages.  When she feels ready to take on those who want her dead, he produces a signal box - Hanna (about 13 yrs old) flips the switch and waits for them to show up while Erik takes off.

The question is WHY?  WHY would they do this? Why not slip quietly into the world and hopefully never be noticed by them, with physical combat skills to protect herself with if she's found?  Or, why not stealthily go after the person(s) who want her dead?  Why the major ""come and get me""?  Why did Erik risk his life to save her, raise and train her to survive and then leave her so vulnerable?  There is no logic to going about it this way.

Not unlike what Directors of many other movies in it's genre attempt to do (a good example would be Bruce Willis's character in ""Live Free or Die Hard"") the ""Hanna"" audience is asked to accept the unlikely. Comparable to what the Director of ""Live Free or Die Hard"" did when Bruce Willis launched a Police Car into a Hovering Helicopter, the Director of Hanna asks the viewers to allow him to bend our perception of realism so we can experience what this isolated young girl is living through. Viewer's should simply enjoy the concept and the ""fictional story"" it portrays to the screen purely for it's entertainment value. Certainly a young girl in her ""Mid Teens"" wouldn't be able to do the things this movie suggests.  Any viewer with the inability to accept the level of fiction this movie has worked into it probably should just avoid watching it altogether. If movies that challenge your perception of character realism turn you off, just save yourself the time and money and skip watching ""Hanna"". You'll be doing yourself a favor by not having to be discontent about a ""fictional 15 year old female assassin"" that doesn't fit into your strict view of fiction vs realism. lol
If you haven't seen this movie yet and you possess even the slightest sense of imagination, you should really enjoy watching it.

4596398,4,B0057GUD7C,"<strong>Hanna</strong> (Joe Wright, 2011)

<em>Hanna</em> was one of my favorite films of 2011, among the relatively few that I have so far seen, so I have no idea why it has taken me so long to actually get around to reviewing it. (And it's third on the list; there are two films I saw before this one I haven't reviewed yet. Sheesh.) Some movies just have to percolate for a long, long time, I guess. Maybe because this is so far removed from the types of things I usually watch, which break down into ""Hollywood blockbusters"" and ""stuff no one's ever heard of before."" <em>Hanna</em>, from what little publicity it received, seemed as if it was of the latter variety, but at the eleventh hour got a push from the distributor to try and turn it into the former. It still has the feel of a small indie film, albeit a brilliantly-shot one with much-nominated director Joe Wright (<em>Atonement</em>) at the helm and a cast stuffed so full of award-winning actors it sometimes felt as if the entire thing would burst at the seams from all the OMGIMPORTANT. And yet, at no point did it ever feel pretentious or overblown or... Hollywood. Even had it not been all that good a film, that sense alone would have endeared me to it. But good it is.

Plot: Hanna (Saoirse Ronan, who worked with Wright on <em>Atonement</em>) is a thirteen-year-old girl living in the middle of nowhere with her father (<em>Chopper</em>'s Eric Bana), a former secret agent who spends his days training his daughter to survive in the world. Problem is, he only knows his own way of doing so, so he's also training her to be, essentially, an assassin. Well, the inevitable happens, his old friends track him down, and he sends Hanna off on a trans-Europe run, being chased by those same operatives, headed up by dad's former boss, the enigmatic Marissa (Cate Blanchett). Do I need to tell you anything else for you to know the entire movie is a setup for a confrontation between Hanna and Marissa? Not if you've watched half a dozen spy thrillers in your life, I don't. But Seth Lochhead's script is entirely unafraid to go places that normal spy thrillers don't, but that make perfect sense given the age and sex of the protagonist (who is, at best, a charming sociopath for whom ""socalized"" may be a word she encountered in the dictionary once), including hooking up for part of her journey with a loud, blowsy British family whose daughter, Sophie (<em>Tamara Drewe</em>'s Jessica Barden), is actually the undiscovered jewel of this film, a brash young actress whose considerable skills enable her to shine in a film containing, well, Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett.

The best thing to do with <em>Hanna</em> is to not take it too seriously. At its heart, this is a simple genre spy thriller with a twist, not some art film with Oscar pretensions. And yet still, there are places where this movie transcends. Most notable is the incredible cinematography courtesy DP Alwin Kuchler (<em>Sunshine</em>); this is a movie that feels just at home in the trackless wastes of Norway as it does, in one memorable scene, inside a bullet hole. (It makes up for the somewhat woeful Chemical Brothers soundtrack, the movie's one real weakness.) The principal actors all bring their A games, and Lochhead's script is a lot of fun; if you missed this one the first time round, see it--but try to catch it on the big screen so you can soak in all that great camerawork. *** ",1327449600,,3436,4.70265780730897

4596400,4,B0057GUD7C,Hanna is a coming of age story.  It starts off with great potential.  Once Hanna enters the world that she has never known she operates easily in it for the most part but has difficulties with other things.  What she does not understand about the world she never knew is not consistent.  She should either have known more or much less.  This inconsistency provides confusion.  There is plenty of action.  Hanna is a likeable character.  It is good entertainment if you do not want to take it too seriously.,1327363200,,506,4.606741573033708
4596401,5,B0057GUD7C,"This movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time. I am familiar with European cinema, so the style was not a surprise to me. I loved the characters, the music, the settings and the story. While the people around me looked puzzled I was drinking in the Grimm references, and recognizing places I have traveled. One reviewer said the Grimm FairyTales were evident but not used directly and I must disagree. The entire movie is a modern day fable, true to the Brothers Grimm. A wicked witch who wants to kill the beautiful princess who has been raised away from civilization. Sleeping Beauty, anyone? Or Rapunzel if you like. The casting is exquisite and I adored seeing Cate Blanchett as a villain, her Texas accent was priceless! I believed Eric Bana as Papa and cried for him. Ms. Ronan is spectacular. Did they write the part for her, or was she born to play it? Who knows?

The film is a visual, aural and mental treat. I never had the chance to see it in the theatre, but when we rented the disk, immediately watched it twice and truly loved it the second time more than the first. The music like the main characters is ethereal and lightning fast, applied with a restrained hand. I can listen to the album anytime and be thrilled.
I do understand some of the negative comments, but they sadden me. If you have only watched TV and Hollywood ""Blockbusters"" you are accustomed to a MacDonald's level movie experience. There is nothing wrong with MacDonald's from time to time, but not every day. ""Hanna"" is a fiercely fine sharp cup of black coffee with a fresh pastry taken in the open air.

There may be a few plot holes, sure enough, but they can be overlooked.  The story is still above-average and well thought out.

Her father is an ex CIA spook who is hiding in the wilderness and training his daughter to be a smart and tough warrior in preparation to be a perfect assassin.

He coaches her in espionage and develops background stories for her to use in case she is ever caught.  Her father realizes that Hanna is ready and he sets into motion the plot for her to achieve her goal.

Likewise, the script does a good job in establishing Hanna's sudden insertion into a world quite alien to her, and her affinity to the vacationing family.
But in the end, HANNA left me feeling cold and detached.  The cruelty of secluding and training a teenage girl to be a vengeful assassin is unjustified and reprehensible.  HANNA is a well done film but not a pleasant movie experience.",1326844800,,691,4.965217391304348

4596415,4,B0057GUD7C,"""Hanna"" is basically a strange blend of ""The Golden Compass"" (2007) and ""The Passenger"" (1975); with a little ""THX 1138"" (1971) thrown in for production design and atmospheric purposes.

Had ""Hanna"" (2011) been promoted for what it was, a relatively low-budget, live-action, PG-13 allegorical fairy tale; with a uniquely quirky performance by Saoirse Ronan, it would be better regarded by the movie going public. Rather than the minimalist promotion and distribution this type of film normally receives, for some reason the distributors decided that it had the potential to make big money.

So they threw almost as much money into marketing as had gone into production, sold the film as an action adventure suspenseful spy story, with another Chloe Moritz type hit girl.  They utilized a saturation booking technique normally reserved for their weaker blockbusters. This technique involves a lot of pre-release publicity and then opening it simultaneously in many theaters, with the goal of generating quick profits before bad reviews and word of mouth kill attendance.

The result was a lot of viewers who rightly felt that the film did not live up to its blockbuster billing, and a failure to appreciate the good points of the film. And there are some very good points. Ronan's earnest portrayal of the title character, a juvenile assassin and good daughter, rings true despite being unlike any character in cinema history.  Ronan manages to blend a bubbly enthusiasm for the newness of everything she missed growing up away from the world (think of a younger version of the Anne Francis ""Alta"" character in ""Forbidden Planet"") with the deadly but ""fish-out-of-water"" qualities of Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""new-to-20th Century-earth"" robot in ""Terminator 2"" (1991).  Ronan has effectively played the bubbly stuff before, most notably in ""City Of Ember"" (2008).  In ""Hanna"" she effortlessly slips back and forth between bubbly wonderment and analytic processing.  These contrasting personas are delivered so effectively (and in so many languages) that the overall performance ranks among the best in cinema history.

And credit director Joe Wright with the vision to stage sequences and POV shots that make Hanna small and vulnerable, enough so to evoke a feeling of protectiveness toward her from viewers.  Altman's ""Kansas City"" (1996) comes to mind, in which Jennifer Jason Leigh's tough talking gun moll created a powerful bond of identification with the viewing audience.

The film is a fairy tale and the good vs evil dynamic is more allegorical than precise.  Cate Blanchett plays a high level CIA operative who functions as the wicked witch.  Basically Snow White's evil queen step-mother masquerading as a cross between the Rosa Klebbs character in ""From Russia With Love"" (1963) and Nicole Kidman's character in ""Golden Compass"" (in fact Kidman's ""Goldren Compass"" character was also named Marisa).  She is assisted by the versatile Tom Hollander, a Wright regular (Mr. Collins from ""Pride & Prejudice"").  Blanchett's Marissa is evil and menacing without the redemption dimensionality of Kidman's ""Golden Compass"" Marisa.  Wright could have had much more fun with Hollander's character, but even so the minion is far more effective than his distaff master.

Wright is not trying to be plausible, if anything the story is more expressionism than realism.  This becomes especially obvious late in the film when the action switches to the huge abandoned Spreepark entertainment center in Berlin.  The park was closed in 1999 and the decaying fairy tale related rides and attractions are a production designer's dream.  These become a key motif of the film, much like the abandoned Salt Air Pavilion in ""Carnival of Souls"".  Also watch for the existential connection between Hanna and Laika, the Soviet dog-in-space;  torn from their world to be passengers through a world in which they do not belong.

Bottom line, I am going to recommend the film.  But with the advice to watch it for Ronan's performance and for its uniqueness; and to not try to place it into any neat classification.

They're name fits the music...""Toxic"".  One of the other movies I heard a soundtrack similar to this was on the ""Tron: Legacy"" movie.  But, that soundtrack flowed.  This one was just a lot of confusion.  At one point it sounded like the music was the sound in the movie, then I realized it was the song!!!

The movie could've done without that little obnoxious girl she ended up ""befriending"".  Wow, what a weird family that was.  Product of hippie parents.  That whole little side-story really was unnecessary.

I had never seen the girl that played ""Hannah"".  She was really good and believable.  Too bad she was a product of a bad film.  I don't know who to blame.  The Director, Producer, or Screenplay.  So, I'll blame them all.

I do agree that the photography of the movie was excellent.  Great angles, shots, etc.

The pace of the movie was slow and you wanted more action and intensity.  Unfortunately, you didn't get that.  The fight scenes you wanted to see more of.  They were just over too quickly.  I know that the movie was supposed to be more realistic, and not a Kung Fu movie per se.  But, it could have been done a little more interestingly.

I really didn't like this movie.  But, that is just me.  I go more for substance of story and pace.  This movie had none of that.

It reminded me of a bad version of ""The Professional"" with Natalie Portman.  Now that was a very good movie.  This one couldv'e been in that same level as story and production.  But, it fell very short.  My recommendation is to avoid this movie.

Beautiful cinematography - I was glad I got the blu-ray version. Fun action sequences. European artsy feel to the whole film.

The storyline is disjointed with some unnecessary subplots and there's sometimes an acid trip feel to some of the scenes but to me, it held together, was different and I enjoyed it.  There are so many male action heroes in movies today and it was nice, for once, to have a rockem sockem female lead.

Well Joe Wright has. I didn't get a chance to see this movie at the theatre and caught a great deal on the blu ray on Black Thursday.

One can see where Wright tried to make a thought provoking movie about advanced science, spies, and the end product itself with under currents of fairy tale ideology. These ideas all sounds good but none of them translated well to the screen.  Note that I have not mentioned the action which is very good but isn't the movie.

I now own three Wright films I doubt that there will be a fourth.  There is no doubting his directorial skill but his movies at least Hanna and Pride and Prejudice had too-too many fast and/or jerky camera movements.  I'm sure it was probably a style tool but ineffective like most of this movie.

4596443,5,B0057GUD7C,"The beauty of this film is subtle; not only is the camerawork and lighting masterful from the opening scene, but also in the action. Erica Bana has a sequence entirely shot in one take, and not only is it a delicious adrenaline boost, but it has a vintage quality that simply cannot be found in today's A.D.D.-driven close-up-only action scene. There's something a European film does that American films cannot do; American flicks provide a temporary high, which only leave you thirsting for more to no avail----this film gives you satisfaction, knowing that you have witnessed a piece of art....a graphic, intense, quirky, and, most importantly, lovable masterpiece.

It is not only the director who contributes to the quality; the actors give stellar performances. Cate Blanchett's villianous role in this film beats her ""Indiana Jones: Crystal Skull"" one out of the water. Eric Bana plays the seemingly cold, but deeply noble Teutonic German role like he's not even acting, but like Jet Li or Jackie Chan, execute an art that is truly a part of real life. Lastly, Saoirse Ronan pioneers a role (at least I have) never seen before; untainted innocence meets Valkyrie-esque fierceness. Definitely a role all females (and males, for the sake of choosing their future bride) must witness.:)

4596446,5,B0057GUD7C,"""Hanna"" is simply a great movie. In today's world where teenage girls grow up in a society obsessed with excessive makeup and fashion, reality TV, Hollywood, and all things shallow and superficial, a thriller like Hanna where the two main characters are tough, fearless, intelligent women is a breath of fresh air that should be praised as a film supporting female empowerment!

Hanna is a teenage girl who was raised in an arctic environment secluded from human contact except for her father (Eric Bana, who delivers a very restrained and nuanced performance. Why doesn't he have an Oscar yet?!). Her father is an ex-CIA agent who has trained her in hand-to-hand combat, honed her skills at archery, and taught her every tactic necessary to be totally self-reliant, while also developing her physical fitness to a superb level. Talk about a good role model for young girls today-- Hanna is strong, smart, and able to defend herself. There are way too many creeps out there looking to prey on young girls. Not our Hanna though... she could eat a child predator for lunch. Awesome characterization and an awesome performance from Saiorse Ronan. She captivated me throughout the film. I didn't want to take my eyes off her. She is eventually taken into custody by CIA agents who appear friendly and just want some answers, however the palpable tension makes us believe they clearly have a hidden agenda.

This brings us to another strong -- yet decidedly malevolent -- female presence on screen. Cate Blanchett plays a cunning CIA agent who desparately pursues Hanna throughout the film. Apparently she used to work with Hanna's father at the CIA.
The plot takes off from there, and I must say it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. There are moments of humor and tenderness, and although some characters' motives and plot involvement are left a little messy, the film comes to a surprising and fulfilling conclusion. ""Wow"" was the only thing I could say, and the film stayed with me for the next few days. I found myself walking around wishing I was as badass and confident as Hanna!

However, it's a bit light on plot so don't expect a lot of intellectual substance here; it's more like a typical action thriller that's quite a bit more colorful and unusual than the average.  Many unique characters, with an interesting premise but very little back story really, so it's more just an amusement park ride to electronica.  I can understand all the varied reviews with almost an even number giving each star rating 1-5; because it's different, I can see that many people will love it or hate it or rightfully be ambivalent about it.  We ended up buying the soundtrack also because we like that kind of music as well.",1322524800,,748,4.723076923076923
4596449,5,B0057GUD7C,"As far as action based hitman movies go ""Hanna"" is certainly a step above most recent movies of this genre. It stars Saroise Ronan (The Lovely Bones) as a young girl who was trained to be the perfect killer by her father (Eric Bana, ""The Hulk"", ""Munich"") who sets her out on a mission that takes her across Europe and into the path of an evil agent (Cate Blanchett, ""Robin Hood""). Of course like most movies of this kind there's always more going on than meets the eye.

The early scenes with Hanna and her father in the Finland wilderness are very good and soon after her father leaves she is captured. The best sequence may have been when she escaped  and took out a whole bunch of guards using the skills that were bred into her. The whole movie while edited quite quickly is overall very well done, Ronan has a unique look and has a certain presence that will fit quite well in Hollywood.

The problem that prevents ""Hanna"" from being a 4 star film is after the initial scenes with her dad and the escape it feels like the movie kinda ran out of juice near the end and that the director felt he had to rush to a finish. Mind you whats here is very good, but it leaves the viewer wanting more.

As a whole ""Hanna"" is a good solid movie that certainly has plenty of originality and lots of good thrills. Its worth having in your DVD collection, especially if you enjoy these type of movies. *** out of 4 stars.

4596455,1,B0057GUD7C,"So I saw the preview. It looked good. The movie is NOT good once it gets past what you see in the preview. Saoirse Ronan plays a girl who is being hunted by the CIA and apparently has spent about 13 of her 14 or so years in a cabin with her father someplace above the Arctic Circle where no one ever goes. She is being constantly trained in shooting, fighting, and other survival skills as well as multiple languages.
First few problems: She has apparently never seen ANYTHING outside of the woods around their cabin. So while really good at shooting reindeer, she would never have seen anything like a TV, a car, or a phone. Their cabin is strictly a kerosene lights and woodstove operation. This seems not the best prep for getting along anyplace outside of an Innuit village. Ms. Ronan is also on the light and short side for her age. The concept of her fighting grown men is a little ahhh - well OK it's a movie. Then she gets to the real world and the movie just dies. It seems a REALLY bad remake of La Femme Nikita with all the techno music and flashing lights. Hanna acts like a cross between the Terminator, 7 of 9, and a lost 7th grader on a field trip. She can recite her (fake) life story by rote, but is utterly clueless at any human interaction and is also terrified by electric fans and TV sets. Meanwhile Cate Blanchet has a southern accent that wanders all over the south from Texas to Virginia. Chases - fights - flashing lights - the end.",1321228800,5,1457,4.301818181818182

4596457,4,B0057GUD7C,"Hanna is an interesting movie, the first thing you notice is that the movie is beautiful, every scene and location is shot with perfection and brilliance making this film a feat for the eyes. The stunning visuals draw the viewer into what is really a pretty weak story. Now the concept of Hanna is not bad, the movie is about a teenage girl who have lived her whole life in the woods with her father, learning to fight, to hunt and to survive. Hanna's only entertainment is a old lexicon and a picture book with fairytales. One day Hanna see a plane going by overhead and she decided that she want more than her life of isolation, her father agree but warn his daughter that there are people who will stop at nothing to see her dead, Hanna can rejoin society only if she manages to defeat and kill those that are after her.

Now the above sounds like a pretty good concept for a movie, a young girl raised apart from modern civilization but trained as a soldier since she was a toddler have to fight a desperate struggle to take down the bad guys and rejoin her father. Well yes it is a decent premise, unfortunately this is all the movie is. While watching the film I was completely drawn in by the beauty of it, and by the character Hanna herself which really are fascinating, however at one point when there where only one sixth left of the movie I started wondering when the plot would start. Yes there is some science fiction elements here, it is clear from the start that Hanna is stronger, faster and smarter than your average human but the whole thing is never well though out, there are no plot twist just evil government agency want girl, girl run around and experiences a world she have never seen before and kill someone now and again while looking for her father, that is it.

I still think Hanna is a good movie but it stands on it's visuals alone. I really do not get why some call it thought provoking, there is nothing here it is just your basic government experiments with making a super soldier, it go sour and now they are trying to cover it up kind of story, no twists no layers no nothing, and what I have just written is not even a spoiler, it is right there from the start, five minutes into the film you know what the entire movie is about. The action is good, the characters is pretty good, especially Hanna, some of the interactions between characters is good. Hanna is a very interesting watch, but there is hardly any story. I do recommend Hanna, I did enjoy watching it and so did my hubby. I think particularly if you like artsy action movies then you will like this, also if you are looking for something different then Hanna is definitely different, that being said I think it is a shame that the creators of this movie did not do more with it, the concept is brilliant if the story had been better this could have been one of the best movie of the year, as it is Hanna is a artsy science fiction action flick with allot going for it and beautiful, haunting scenery, but that is also all it is.",1320796800,,3027,4.336860670194003

4596459,4,B0057GUD7C,"This was a truly unique movie, and the young star, Saoirse Ronan, puts in an exceptional performance that will hopefully lead to much more to come for her. She is gorgeous and ethereal on screen, with a face that subtly displays every emotion, without overacting. It's hard to say too much about the plot of this movie without spoiling it, so I won't, but basically Eric Bana plays her father, and the movie starts with them in a remote, frozen tundra where he is training her as an assassin or warrior of some type, although we don't really know why. Cate Blanchett also stars, as an intelligence officer somehow embroiled in what is going. The movie is an action adventure, but the pacing, filming, music, and soulfulness are more indie than blockbuster, and the entire thing really hinges on the performance of Saoirse Ronan, who more than pulls it off.

I was engaged all the way through, but my husband found it a bit slow and dull in parts. I was OK with the pacing - I appreciated the more nuanced character development, which you don't usually see in action films - but I did think the ending lacked a bit. While I welcome the attempt to not simply tie everything up in a neat little bow, in this case a little too much was left unexplained, IMHO. So that's the only reason I give it 4, rather than 5, stars. But definitely worth seeing.",1320710400,2,1345,4.489795918367347
4596460,5,B0057GUD7C,"There is so much about `Hanna' that shouldn't work, and yet it does; remarkably so.  The plot could have easily been clich&eacute;d and rather tired, and yet it feels youthful and modern.  The plot twists could have been predictable (and at times they are) and yet they feel necessary to the progression of the film.  There are depictions here that could have been deemed mere gimmick if handled poorly (especially the bookended scenes and specific phrasing) and yet they are dynamic in scope and wholly effective.

There is so much `right' about this movie.

`Hanna' tells of a young girl of sixteen who has been trained in isolation by her father to be an assassin.  She has trained her whole life to defend herself against the woman responsible for the death of her mother, the woman who would stop at nothing to end her life.  She has trained for the moment she would be ready to confront and kill this adversary.  When the film opens, Hanna is ready.  Once the switch is flipped (quite literally as well as figuratively) there is no turning back, and Hanna soon finds herself being sabotaged by an enemy smarter than she expected.

A word of caution, `Hanna' is extremely violent, even for a PG-13.  The violence is also of a more disturbing nature, considering that the main proprietor of this violence is a young teenage girl.  To see Hanna snap a woman's neck and then shoot countless men in a single scene can be a bit much for some to watch.  The violence is never gory (although, the scene with the man hanging from the ceiling is a tad gruesome) but it is gratuitous and so one should be aware before committing to watching the film that it will be intense, and then some.

For me, this film is the perfect amalgam of film arc-types.  It is an action film on the surface, a dramatic love story at the core and is beautifully glossed over with art house flare.

I want Joe Wright to direct the next James Bond film.  I know that they decided to change directors with every new film because it adds a layer of individualism to each individual piece, but once Sam Mendes is done (another finely underrated director, so I'm pleased) can the reigns be handed over to Wright?  He shows such depth of cinematic viewpoint in `Hanna'.  The way he weaves emotional tones into the action, as well as the way he stages his scenes to play out like a beautiful painting; it's all so mesmerizing.  He captures action like a pro, but he never allows the action to take over the core themes of the film.  The score is to die for and the cinematography is delicious (especially that opening sequence).  Cate Blanchett may be a caricature, but she's an effective one.  Bana is superb (great accent work), I just wish he was used more.  I also loved seeing Tom Hollander (creepy, seductive, interesting) spice up the film, and young Jessica Barden is astonishingly effective as the `friend' Hanna develops in her travels.  She also has deft comedic timing, which is a raw asset she should cultivate.

The girl is sharp.

But there really is Saoirse Ronan, and no one else.  She is magnificent here.  Not only does she handle the physical aspect of the performance (the accent, the action scenes, the languages, the presence) but she captures the emotional trauma of the character as well.  She portrays such depth in her eyes, but she never betrays her character's innocence.  You never feel as though Hanna knows `too much', for she is always believably nave, but she manages to get a slick handle on her character's more advanced education, the harsher grasp on her `emotional makeup'.  You never doubt her killer instincts, and yet she really wins you over when she begins to understand love and friendship.

I can't wait to see this girl's future!

So, despite the thematic issues (more from a moral standpoint and an obvious personal reaction) this is a film I highly recommend.  It is styled perfectly, and yet the style never trumps substance.

You teach her 5 skillion languages, but never expose her to music? Whatever. The Brit vacation family is too cutesy and messes w/ the plot momentum. The big reveal is a big disappointment. The Big Bad Wolf character emerging from the maw of a big bad wolf is a big groan. Still, the actors and the director have fun with the silly script. Hanna's escape from the complex is a trippy stobe-flashing treat. The show-off tracking shot that ends concludes w/ a fight scene staged in a single shot is a refreshing change from typical action movie overcutting.

We find young Hanna seemingly in training to be some kind of assassin. And it's clear from the start that Hanna has some extraordinary abilities for a tonnage girl. Hanna is just dying to finish her training and get out on ""her mission."" And indeed her mission turns out to be a whole lotta whoop-aze for those that come between her and her final target.

Good action and good fight scenes are balanced by a predictable if not downright familiar storyline and only fair at best acting (with the exception of Saoirse Ronan who played Hanna quite well).

It goes much as expected for the first parts of the movie, with lots of action and impressive combat along with a thoughtful plot.  Unfortunately, somewhere towards the middle, it seems that the writers forgot that Hanna was supposed to be an amazing killer.  She spends the last half of the movie running away from people and generally letting us down in terms of originality, excitement, common sense, and action.

4596483,3,B0057GUD7C,"The concept of the film is an exciting one: a 16-year-old assassin,  la Mathila from THE PROFESSIONAL (but intensified), is on the run from government agents, namely a slick CIA woman for as-of-yet unclear reasons. The visuals are sleek and even poetic, which sets this particular film apart from other thrillers.

The set-up of the film raises an intriguing question. Will Hanna Heller (played by the magnificently sensitive Saoirse Ronan) decide to leave the nest of the forest in Finland in order to discover the world outside, in spite of the dangers that she is almost certain to encounter? This is a question encountered by many ""normal"" people on some level, and it is a particularly pertinent question, given this day and age (and economy).

The main problem stems from the tone of the film. It is part LA FEMME NIKITA, part THE PROFESSIONAL, part RUN LOLA RUN, part THE BOURNE IDENTITY, part...HOME ALONE?

The Grimms fairy tales are so important to the overall meaning of the film that it is set up in the first couple minutes, and Hanna even recites multiple times throughout that she has to meet her father (Eric Bana) at Wilhelm Grimm's house in Berlin. Unfortunately, the film's connection to the Grimms tales seems superficial at best, and it appears that the Brothers Grimm are mentioned purely so that there is an interesting-looking location for the climax (big fairy tale bed, faux candy, brightly-colored set decor in the aforementioned house).

It seems incongruous that Hanna, who has been trained to the extent that even her father ambushes her in the middle of the night to test her (in fact to drill into her head that she is never safe, even while sleeping), would later freely confess her planned meeting place to her new friend Sophie. This, of course, could be attributed to Hanna's humanization, her opening up to the very first friend in her life, but given the caution shown beforehand to mold her into a callous fighting machine, this seems sloppy and lazy--just an easy means to allow the antagonists to find her in order to get to the climax.

The minions Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett) employs to help find Hanna and her father are ludicrous and contribute largely to the film's downfall. Isaacs (Tom Hollander) is the main henchman, and he has a bad blond dye-job and dresses in different bright-colored jogging suits with his two dome-headed accomplices. One accomplice, by the way, is a tall wiry man who wears acid-wash skinny jeans with knee-high boots and a cropped nylon jacket.

Yeah. Acid. Wash. Skinny. Jeans.

There you go. They provide comic relief, but juxtapose any scenes with these henchmen with one of the most exciting scenes of the film: Hanna under surveillance by the CIA in a clinically sparse holding cell, reminiscent of something out of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE or SALT. So, these henchman are what Hanna, with all her back-breaking training and ability to beat up a team of grown men without blinking, is matched up against? They mirror the bad guys in HOME ALONE--Harry, the mastermind who is slightly less stupid than his partner and therefore leader, and of course Marv, the moron. In both these films, the idiotic antagonists are outsmarted by a fast kid. Except HOME ALONE is marketed as a comedy, so that works. One wonders why Wiegler, with all her purported acuity and resources at the CIA, couldn't come up with better henchmen than ones she picks up at a bar.

Wiegler is simultaneously amazing and disappointing. With her sharply-tailored dress suits, cropped red hair, stark make-up, and expensive designer heels, Wiegler cuts an impressive figure as she gives orders at the CIA. She is clearly a powerful woman in charge, not afraid to screw on a silencer on a gun in order to kill--well, as it turns out, anybody. Though she appears as robotic as Hanna in the beginning, she reveals some concessions she has had to make in order to get to the top of the totem poll. When asked if she ever had children, Wiegler somberly responds, ""I made certain choices."" She is not simply the Evil Queen of the fairy tale, but had the film explored this aspect of her character a bit more, the ending (as it is, ridden with simple mistakes) would have been more satisfying.

The family Hanna shacks up with is a touching bedrock of the film, particularly when Hanna witnesses the family bonding and kidding around in a way that she never got a chance to experience. Unfortunately, her friend Sophie's dialogue is comically stilted and extremely unrealistic (this works in a lot of films, but not this one). The highlight of the family is the young Aldo Maland, who plays Sophie's younger brother Miles. Though he's not in many scenes, he steals the ones he is in with his hilarious facial expressions and reactions to the actions of the confusing adult world around him.

In the end, the climax of the film doesn't feel earned, simply because the story hasn't woven the Grimms allegory deep enough in order to justify the silly antagonists and out-of-the-ordinary tidbits. The setting screams, ""LOOK AT THE COOL ABANDONED AMUSEMENT PARK WITH THE BROKEN ELEPHANT! AND THE COOL GRIMM HOUSE! ISN'T THIS GIANT BED COOL? SEE? IT'S THE GRIMMS, YOU SEE...JUST LIKE IN THE BOOK HANNA READS WITH HER DAD!""

Despite its flaws, the film is, however, worth watching just to see Saoirse Ronan handle a rare role like this. It is not every day that a filmmaker attempts to portray a 16-year-old character in such a complex and philosophical way. Ronan seems to handle every possible state director Joe Wright throws at her with ease--confusion, happiness, nervousness, anger, and freedom. Oh, and she kicks major ass, too, holding her own against men more than twice her age and size.",1318896000,,5728,4.84560327198364

But as I said, the beginning and the end were just terrible. **potential spoiler alert** The father and daughter wouldn't have been chased by the government if they hadn't pressed that stupid button...why they couldn't simply integrate themselves back into society quietly is beyond me.

Add some high-biotech, beyond state-of-the-art manipulation of basic reproductive material in a weapons-grade experiment that gets out of hand, and we're still not enirely out of the domain of plausibility.  Write a slam-bang story based on an admittedly far-fetched rendering of the foregoing premise.  Recruit a cast of really fine actors, including those who fill the roles of kids who are, in various winsome ways, precocious but never obnoxious, and you've got a really fun movie.  In this case you've got Hanna.

As played by Saoirse Ronan, Hanna is an engaging character who combines almost unlimited resourcefulness, a purposefully focused cloak-and-dagger sort of sophistication, and a very believable naivete' in a world that is exciting, dangerous, and wherein she finds genuine friendship and affection.  While on the run from the off-handedly evil Marissa (Cate Blanchett) and her henchmen, Hanna joins up with a family headed by a couple of well-meaning and likeable latter day hippies.  Their daughter Sophie is about the same early-adolescent age as Hanna, and Sophie's little brother is immediately taken with our pretty and daring protagonist.  The family is determinedly accepting of differences of all kinds, and the parents encourage their children to be independent.  Even they, however, can't help but notice that Hanna is, well, special.

The hippie family provides aid and comfort for Hanna when she needs it most, and the cleverly written story, along with remarkably capable actors, avoids annoying stereotypes that often emerge when dealing with '60's throwbacks.  Sophie, Hanna's first real friend, is naturally articulate, self-assured beyond her years, and genuinely funny.  Even Sophie, however, is stunned and frightened when she sees for herself what Hanna does to  survive the onslaught of the nefarious bureaucrat, Marissa, and her hired assassins, be they jack-booted thugs or more than a little effeminate impresarios.

Cate Blanchett is perhaps a bit too bland, maybe even wooden, as an amoral government official.  Throughout the movie her voice and accent change in ways and for reasons that are not explained.  Erik Bana does a fine job as Hanna's father, as tough as he has to be, but also genuinely loving.  His role, too, could have easily collapsed into a tough-but-tender stereotype, but Bana is a better actor than that, and he's working with a really nice screenplay.

The movie does not take itself too seriously, and neither should we.  Hanna is a fun movie, loaded with excitement, none of which seems gratuitous.  Nothing deep or profound here, just a good story, even if it is a bit outlandish, with a lot of action and a really fine cast.  Just relax and enjoy it.

What's good: seeing Hanna react and adjust to the outside world - meeting electricity and other people and showers. I'd wager the lesbian-toned kiss between her and another teen is what earned all the critical acclaim, because the script is Luc Besson material (think Fifth Element, not Taken). Some ""symbolism"" in filming in Wilhelm Grimm's house, bad wolf, wicked witch, etc., but somewhat blunt.

The climax is a letdown - for all their training, the promise of Hanna's training is feebly realized, and some main characters are taken down like rank amateurs. There is no intelligence to their final encounters, no smarts, no skill, no payoff for all that training. A superior movie in this regard would be Die Hard. There we see the hero and villains actually use their brains. As such, this movie is kind of a missed mess of genres.

4596513,4,B0057GUD7C,"Hanna is a 2011 action film directed by Joe Wright, (Atonement, The Soloist), and stars Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana, and Cate Blanchett.  In a nutshell, it's the story of a teenage girl named Hanna who has been raised by her father in a Finland forest.  He has kept her completely severed from society and technology while raising her to be an assassin.  The film follows her submergence into our world once she goes to task.

I read some of the negative reviews of this film before pulling the trigger and they actually pushed me towards the purchase.  Most of the bleating came from people advising me that the first thirty minutes housed the only scenes of real value and that the film went flaccid for the next hour.  That was exciting to me because I'm tired of watching car chases recycle themselves for hours on end while a soundtrack made up entirely of rapidly escalating explosions pounds like blistering techno until robots and/or trite superheroes show up and throw flaming meteorites at the scorched earth to attack/defend the human race.  I'm just tired of that stuff.

But I still want action, and I got it.  In proper dosage, even.  The fight scenes choreographed for this film were presented at a heightened, but still reasonable human level and I appreciate that.  The director clearly wanted to keep the film on a more realistic track for its duration and there's some beauty in that.  The results were invigorating to me because I stayed connected which is a huge deal.  It was well done.

That being said, the other elements in this film were also executed splendidly.  And yes, the movie does slow down, but not in a bad way.  A story develops, characters are introduced, and yes, I can live without gunfire for awhile while this all goes down.  I just don't see the problem.

(Especially with the Chemical Brothers orchestrating the soundtrack?!  SCORE.)

I think the only problem I had with the film was listening to Cate Blanchett with a southern accent.  Something just didn't feel right there.  Aside from that, however, the acting was stellar.

In the end, I think I dug the movie because there's zero cheese.  None.

And I need no cheese.

She reminds me of a chameleon as she transforms herself to become complex characters in every movie she is in.  She is not afraid to strip her exterior as she evolves for her audience.  Hanna is a MUST SEE movie.  It combines intelligent and assertive screen writing with contrasting actors who are able to compliment each other's skill.

a) The plot was 100% predictable and played out EXACTLY as you probably guessed after the first 30 minutes.  It's easy to see the whole story and know exactly how it is going to end only 30 minutes into it.

b) I wish the music soundtrack was not so annoying.  Maybe it is my age (close to 50) ... but an action movie like this does not feel right with some Techno-Dance THUMP THUMP Bass music that sounds like it belongs in a South Beach night club.

c) It really is pretty dull and boring with most of the story being Hannah traveling on the road with a bunch of gypsy-like people ....... sadly this makes 75% of the movie feel like filler.

It's a bit quirky and has a little of that weird ""euro-artsy-fartsy"" feel to it that unfortunately serves to prevent the movie being as intense as it could be.

But the poor direction and poorly performed action scenes, once she shows up on the underside of a Humvee, were tiring along with an almost intolerable soundtrack. I was surprised at the low quality of action tolerated by the director. I believe Saoirse Ronan has the ability to perform the action scenes as well as Angelina Jolie did in SALT. That would have made this a real movie. What they saved on this garbage soundtrack could have been invested in better direction and higher quality action scenes. In fact, just leave out the soundtrack altogether. Even the phone conversations sounded acoustically raspy and unnatural, as if they were rushed.

Directed by Joe Wright, Atonement, If you didn't know better you would swear he had directed action before. The movie does have a lot of action. Filmed very well, not that shaky camera stuff either. The plot is a little thin and the ending is pretty much predictable. The acting was really good again. Eric Banna no stranger to action, and Cate Blanchete who plays the villain over the top but you can tell she had fun with it. The movie is being called a art house action movie because after Hanna thinks she takes care of her problems she has to trek across Europe mostly with a very odd family where Hanna Learns about the world and how ill prepared she is to deal with it. Just when things start to fell slow the movie kicks back into action until its ending. The cinematography is insanely beautiful. Form the Cold winter wonderland to the scorching desert, Hanna's whole journey looks amazing on Blu ray. The score is one of the best I have heard, somewhat like Tron Legacy's score, its loud and will get your heart pumping. My only problems were I had a slight disconnect with the family Hanna stays with and I thought it shouldn't have been so predictable.

4596524,4,B0057GUD7C,"Like all fruits how can one say which is better? Thus, the obvious comparison of Hanna with Dragon Tattooed Girl trilogy and Kick-Ass girl all of which, to their credits, showed unique and creative storytelling. But, if a choice has to be made then Kick-Ass has an edge with the awe/cool factor. Their are several reasons why this female assassin fell a little short of five star greatness such as the following: First, the background story seemed a little holey as in too many holes to be totally coherent and thus envelop the viewers. Second, the genetic manipulation could have been more educative, which that field is, and less dumb photo montage and thus make the story more believably incredible. Third, for a girl of such potential she seemed to vacillate between super skill and super dumb actions/decisions. Fourth, the action scenes which are what the movie ultimately is to be judged upon were stereotypically bland and inconsistent. Fifth, the alternate ending should have been added after the final kill.

On the positive side the cinematography was creative with angles, field of view, light and color. The locations and sets were outstanding from Finland to Morocco and finally a little Grimms' bad wolf as the final set. The story was creative despite the holes. The acting was excellent especially Saoirse as Hanna who showed good athleticism which is a bonus for a lead female actor in an action film. In fact, her sprinting technique indicates a potential track star.

4596534,2,B0057GUD7C,"Any thriller or suspense about a 16-year-old girl assassin requires a considerable amount of suspension of disbelief. The task becomes even harder when the storyline is saddled with countless plot holes, incredible coincidences and impossible motives. Don't get me wrong. I know disregard to realistic possibility is not actually a bad thing, and I enjoyed such actions as ""The Long Kiss Good Night."" But in the case of ""Hanna,"" things just went too far.

The film centers on a girl Hanna Heller (Saoirse Ronan), raised and home-schooled by her father Erik Heller (Eric Bana) in the wilderness of Finland. Under Erik's tutelage Hanna has been training more than ten years to be a perfect killing machine. Hanna is growing up fast, getting more and more interested in the world outside, and one day Erik asks her to make a decision. She does it, and deadly battles with CIA operatives begin, while she meets people including a traveling family in the desert.

You can argue that ""Hanna"" is not really an action thriller, but a character-driven drama about the titular heroine like ""La Femme Nikita."" Some might find fairy-tale elements in some of the episodes and characters, and Cate Blanchett's wicked-witch like agent is one of them. To me, ""Hanna"" seems more like a pretentious effort from filmmakers who fail to realize the film's derivative premise, which is hardly covered by the showy camerawork (including the director Joe Wright's trademark long take), and the superficial treatment of dramatic and allegorical aspects.

I like Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett. I tried to like the film, but found it very hard to do so, when Hanna, easily frightened by television and electricity, drops in a shop, uses a computer and access the internet; when chasing agents commit stupid mistakes again and again; when, most importantly, secrets and twists (very slowly revealed) are nothing really original.

I'm not sure what I had been expecting of this movie. Suspense, action, the thrill of watching a young girl with skills beyond her years in a desperate struggle to escape the clutches of a recruitment facility. Well, most of those elements were there, I suppose, but the movie offered them with such a slow, guarded hand that I got bored waiting to sample it.

The characters felt insubstantial. Even after I got to the point that verified their pasts and existences, I had reached those conclusions very early on and stopped caring. I'm told this movie is a ""coming-of-age"" for Hanna, but I didn't, no, couldn't sympathize with the pain she was meant to feel upon learning the truth. Her character didn't feel real, not with the some of the stunts she was able to pull off - the unrealistic erased the praise for the realistic. I do not wish to reveal spoilers, but it was not the truth about Hanna that made her impossible to connect with. By the end of the movie, I was hoping she would be killed to give the movie a change of pace.

It has received good reviews from a number of people, so maybe there was something I didn't see here. However, I have no intentions of watching a second time just to find out.",1316304000,9,1394,4.374517374517374

Initially I didn't rate the film very highly. The plot seemed a little psycho and outlandish and I couldn't quite get a handle on it. But then it all came into focus: the movie grabs because it is an allegory for abortion. Hannah was the one that somehow escaped being terminated and the job had to be finished. The movie presents her as some kind of dangerous experiment that was called off but in real life the kid's always treated as the threat. Very well done.",1316304000,,806,4.489795918367347

4596545,2,B0057GUD7C,"I was excited to see HANNAH the moment I saw the trailer and was intrigued by the storyline immediately. Then there was Saoirse Ronan (Hannah), who has been a great young star. Not to mention, Cate Blanchett (Marissa) gasping as she watches through the one-way window as it is implied that Hannah has just skillfully ended the life of a woman who was posing as Blanchett's character, Marissa. Then of course Eric Banna rounding out an already interesting cast. So, imagine my disappointment when I found out that HANNAH wouldn't be coming to a theatre near me. In fact, it didn't even come to my STATE!! So, I had had to wait for the video. It finally was available in my town and I rushed to rent it, in fact, I almost bought the thing before seeing it. I was THAT pumped.

I'm glad I didn't buy it. Where do I start? The first thing that ruined the film for me was the overemphasis on artistic vision. Long drawn out shots and camera tricks and heartbeat sounds were all so overly done, I was rolling my eyes after about 25 minutes. All of this is signs of a Director who is trying way too hard to impress. Maybe that's because his first two films were highly praised and one, ATONEMENT, was showered with Oscars. The thing is, he didn't have to try so hard to impress. The story and the actors were good enough to do that, we didn't really have to have a camera that twisted completely 360 degrees while Hannah runs. Were we trying to cover up that most of the film is Hannah running? Maybe.

The deep characters in HANNAH were never truly fleshed out. We could never actually say that we knew them. The camera spent the most time with HANNAH, and we sort of get to know her. Although, she is, believe it or not, the least interesting of the characters. She's basically a tool of her father. A killing machine, trained to right the wrongs and revenge the death of her mother, who she never met.

Unfortunately for HANNAH, that is about as far as the depth goes in this movie. There are no twists and turns. There is running and there are sets that are so choreographed, I thought I was watching a Jackie Chan movie. Colorful duck boats lined in a row so that Hannah can jump across them. Did they have to be big obnoxious duck boats? Couldn't they be ordinary boats? Couldn't there have been a space between a couple of them so that she had to REALLY jump far to get across the water? Nope. Instead, as Hannah jumps, we spent the ten seconds looking at the boats, instead of focusing on Hannah.

Not enough movie and too much director to enjoy this one. On every turn of this film, all I could think about was the Director's gimmicks instead of losing myself in the film. Director Joe Wright should have let the great actors he had tell the story, instead of wasting time with... E[...] a deer!

Hannah has its moments, but those moments are few and far between for a movie that has no personality and those moments are so few, that they garner only 2 stars from this reviewer.",1316044800,2,2980,4.381555153707052
4596546,2,B0057GUD7C,"We bought this and watched it with our friends, I don't think any of us were impressed at all.  The story line was lacking and it ended poorly.  I was hoping for more content.  I was very dissapointed.",1315958400,5,201,4.2368421052631575
4596547,2,B0057GUD7C,"Before I watched this movie, I thought it would be an exciting one.  Hanna is a girl raised by her father in the woods.  She learns everything there is to know about survival and protecting herself from any threats (human or not) from her father.  Her father is an ex-CIA agent.

The first part of the movie was good.  However, the rest (or most) the movie was very predictable.  The plot was basically a one big chase, and the final showdown.  Another problem with this movie was over the top sound effects and the music, both of which was very distracting.  This movie was made in such a way that the viewer would have to fill in lots and lots of blanks without questioning any of it.  At some point you think it is just not worth it.

There is some action in it, but nothing like the Bourne series.",1315872000,5,801,4.28

Most of the negative reveiws seem to have a problem with new and inovative movie making....maybe in a few years they will come around!

4596549,4,B0057GUD7C,"The trailer may exaggerate the amount of action that is in the movie. Hanna has a modest amount of violence compared to what I was expecting. However, the movie is still exciting.

The movie has an impressive cast and it looks like the director, Joe Wright, took full advantage of the talented people he worked with on the film. I cannot point out any flaws in the performances. Based on the roles each individual was given, none of them disappoint.

The roles themselves are a different matter. The developments of the main characters are not very strong. Even with an hour and 50 minutes, it feels like the characters are emotionally shallow. This is kind of a difficult thing to point out because if Joe Wright decided to linger on the feelings of each main character, the movie would have been extended, which may have lead to a slow, boring pace.

Instead of a sluggish, monotonous tempo, Joe Wright goes with a faster, exciting rate. Considering how the events unfold, everything appears to happen relatively fast. One must keep in mind that a persistent government agent, aided by ruthless, resourceful thugs, is hunting down a little girl. The antagonists seem to always be on her tail. Based on their methods, the agent and her thugs keep the tension of the movie high.

The excitement of the story is amplified by the music. Hanna is a fine example of how the soundtrack can be crucial to storytelling. The best scenes of the movie tend to be accompanied by the sounds of The Chemical Brothers.

Finally, the action is probably the main attraction based on the trailer. While I did mention that the action is modest, the fight and chase scenes are spectacular. When I say modest, I imply that the frequency of the action is modest. Hanna is not the type of action movie that incorporates intricate fighting sequences in every other scene. The makers of the movie do a fine job of balancing story structure and fight choreography.

My rating of this movie is four stars, but the rating reflects the fact that I rented the movie for $3.99. Hanna is a sweet movie for a $3.99 rental. If I saw this movie in the theaters or if I purchased a copy for my collection, I would have given Hanna a three, if not two, star rating. This is the type of movie that a person watches once and seldom views certain scenes.",1315785600,2,2315,4.593220338983051

Maybe I missed the point from the start which would have been crucial to the rest of the film, but it wouldn't have mattered because there was very little dialogue between the actors  anyway.

4596551,5,B0057GUD7C,"I had high expectations of this film and it did not let me down in the slightest. First off, I must say that the Blu-ray is one of the clearest I have seen. The soundtrack of the film is amazing to say the least and I instantly downloaded it after the film. The Chemical Brothers do an amazing job. Probably their best work.

The film is very original and tells a story of a young girl, Hanna, who was raised by her father and trained to fight and support herself. They live out in the middle of nowhere, they hunt their own food and are cut off from any civilization. Hanna is curious as to the outside world and music and people, however he father discourages her of this. After a while her father presents a box with a switch to Hanna. He further explains that someone will come to find them if she flips the switch. She of course flips it and teams of bad guys and helicopters show up. The father takes off and leaves Hanna to fend for herself. She is captured and taken to a facility, but is that part of the plan?

Over-all Hanna blew me away. It is original, however ideals from past films do shine through the plot at times. The cinematography is superb and the music is very well built into the actions on the screen. The locations are also very carefully and brilliantly chosen. I was highly impressed and cannot wait to watch this film again. In a sea of horrible movies which are pushed out each week, Hanna excels as one of the best movies I have seen this year.

It really started going downhill with the introduction of the English hippies.  At about 50 minutes in, I was thinking, please please let this be the last scene with the English hippies.  But no, they kept showing up again, again, and again.  Sadly, that scene in the bunker was the best action scene of the movie.

I'd say the girl that played Hanna was very good.  The guy who played the father was great too.  Both seemed very believable in their parts.  Cate Blanchett?  Well, I have nothing good to say about her performance, definitely a weak point of the movie.  Her fake southern accent was so annoying.

Why Marissa wants Hanna and Erik dead is a mystery and, when Hanna escapes from her captors, she heads across Europe to meet her father in Berlin.
END OF SPOILERS:

Directed by Joe Wright (""Atonement"")and based on a spec script by Seth Lockhead (rewritten by David Farr) voted one of the best unproduced screenplays is a mess of a movie; it has promise but director Wright insists on using a pounding score by The Chemical Brothers that doesn't fit the film at all and insists on using arty direction in a thriller that demands more straight forward honest direction.

Actors Ronan, Bana and Blanchett do the best with the material that they can while the fight sequences are often stunning and expertly choreographed but, unfortunately, that can't save director Wright's heavy handed approach to the material.

The Blu-ray often looks stunning with detailed presentation. The image quality is occasionally soft by deliberate choice. Colors are muted which is keeping with the theatrical look of the film. Over all, this is a visually impressive presentation of the film.

The 5.1 lossless presentation is also outstanding with a lively presentation filled with detail particularly noticeable during the opening sequence set in Finland.

The special features inclulde a commentary by director Wright. He provides an interesting and articulate discussion on the merit of his film.

We also get a number of very good featurettes including one that is oddly named ""Central Intelligence Agency"" but actually focuses on the fairy tales that provide a portal to understanding Hanna and her ""world"".

The Chemical Brothers also appear in a featurette discussing their score.

""The Escape from Camp G"" gives us some insight into the shooting of the chase scene when Hanna escapes.

We get deleted scenes, a promo and a slightly longer alternate ending on the Blu-ray.

""Hanna"" has a great premise poorly executed by director Joe Wright who completely miscalculates in terms of his approach to the material and uses a score by The Chemical Brothers that doesn't add anything to the film at all. Despite some strong performances ""Hanna"" fails to escape the threat of mediocrity.

But actually the quote could summarize the response of most people who watch this strange film  Written by newcomers Seth Lochhead and David Farr and directed by Joe Wright who has 'The Soloist', 'Atonement', and 'Pride & Prejudice' to his credits, the problem with the film is the telling of the story: the whole thing makes sense at the end but before that the audience is left in somewhat of a quandary as to who is who and where is where  and why the whole thing is progressing the way it does.  Thankfully the entire concept is resolved in the closing minutes - and anyone who shares those secrets in a review would be doing a disservice to those who will encounter this gripping, action-packed thriller.

The story opens in the forest in winter in Finland: teenage Hanna (Saoirse Ronan, an actress who is maturing very well indeed) lives with her father Erik (Eric Bana), an ex-CIA agent who has devoted his life sequestered with his daughter to raise her to be the perfect soldier.  They spar, challenge each other's fighting skills, hunt, share books, all the wile Erik is making Hanna memorize data about being from the Grimm house (as in the Brothers Grimm) in Berlin. At a certain point Hanna feels she is ready to go into the real world on her 'mission' and Erik changes his hunter costume for a suit and departs also (a strange signal box is turned on that will alert Erik's past confreres as to his return.  From this point we follow Hanna into many strange places including an interrogation chamber which seems totally foreign to her and tricks her into thinking her skills have accomplished her mission of killing one Marissa (Cate Blanchett).  Hanna escapes and continues her journey across Europe, Morocco, and unnamed places, all the while on the run and practicing her well-informed assassin skills.  She is followed by Marissa, and by the bizarre Isaacs (Tom Hollander) and his companion CIA Tech #1 (Paris Arrowsmith).  Hanna meets quite by accident a family on vacation -the hippie mother Rachel (Olivia Williams), the father Sebastian (Jason Flemyng) and their two children Sophie (Jessica Barden in a superb role as Hanna's only friend) and Miles (Aldo Maland). As the enemy closes in on Hanna and her adopted family, Hanna must leave and head for Berlin, all the while Erik is making his way toward Berlin, desiring to face Marissa with the secrets of Hanna's beginnings as a human experiment. And form that point the story must be guarded from those who must figure out the ending for themselves.

Saoirse Ronan and Eric Bana give superb performances: Cate Blanchett seems oddly miscast here, having a difficult time figuring out which of her accents belongs to the monochromatic role. This is not a film for those who need linear storytelling: the  film does jump around a bit seemingly in search of a story, but that all comes to pass in the film's end. It is a brainy movie, well made, and one that keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat, scratching the head, until the final minutes.  Grady Harp, September 11",1315353600,2,3247,4.685413005272408
4596575,2,B0057GUD7C,"The first 15 to 20 minutes is beautiful and kudos to the crew but it's a slide from there. Just to say it, they should have hired a Chinese martial artist advisor. Some of it is well choreographed and edited but that too slides as the film proceeds. The 'super' presumably CIA agent, and the evil henchmen who either Hanna or Eric should have dispatched with one hand suddenly become their equal when necessary to the declining plot. In reality they are simply the psychopathic three stooges. The 'identity crisis' Hanna has because, having mastered the internet and come to fully understand molecular genetics in about 5 minutes, she understands that she is 'different' which leads directly to another plot failure. I really wanted to like this film from the trailer. It looked original and exciting and, at the beginning it was exactly that. Banality crept in like an ever deflating balloon. I think the writer really had no understanding of his main character and the director was simply clumsy in his transitioning Hanna from the pristine life of a subarctic dweller entering 'civilization' for the first time and dealing with all that entails to the precious little spoiled Eurogirl that she seems to become. Sorry to be clumsy myself here expressing my disappointment, this being the first time I have chosen to ever comment on a movie but that disappointment is what drove me here. Bana was good but winds up doing absolutely stupid things. Ronan is good but ditto. Both of their characters go from being highly competent to bumblers to serve the writer's lack of imagination. I think you will be very happy up to about the sewer cover in the middle of a desert...sorry, guys. I REALLY wanted to like this movie.

4596577,5,B0057GUD7C,"Director Joe Wright does a 180 from his acclaimed ""Atonement"" and delivers an action thriller that doesn't conquer new territory as much as it brings some grit to the genre.  ""Hanna"", stars Saoirse Ronan who got an Oscar nom from her role in the aforementioned ""Atonement"".  Here, she's a 16 year old girl far removed from civilization (some remote Scandinavian country) living with her ex-spy dad Erik (Eric Bana).  They are evidently evading the CIA and/or other evil goon squads.  There's a secret about the girl that we suspect but don't see until later.  Once Dad is convinced she can survive on her own, she is turned loose to head back to the world.  Dad goes the other way with a plan to reunite in Berlin.  Ronan is remarkable as a world class martial artist, showing real prowess.  At times she also is a regular if nave, teenager.  Brilliant acting including Cate Blanchette as the CIA officer in charge and the quirky Jessica Barden from ""Tamara Drewe"" and a rocking Chemical Brothers soundtrack help elevate this movie from the norm.

BLU RAY UPDATE:
This is a Blu ray update and second viewing.  It might seem unusual for director Joe Wright who is known more for the likes of ""The Soloist,"" ""Atonement, "" and ""Pride and Prejudice"" to take on an action flick like this.  It is a pretty straight forward escape and exact revenge film.  Nothing unusual about that.  Nothing really unusual about the fact that it is a female seeking retribution.  Nothing really unusual even that it is a teen-ager.

So what makes this film so interesting?  First and foremost, Wright spends enough time with Hanna early in the film to make you believe she could be a lethal weapon.  After all, she's 16 and about 100 pounds.  Raised by her father (Eric Bana), a former CIA operative, in remote northern Finland, Hanna is trained to survive and kill those who would harm her.  In a brilliant about face, Oscar nominee (for the aforementioned ""Atonement,"") Saoirse Ronan is totally convincing in spite of her sprite-like presence.  While the action sequences are truly excellent, Wright takes the time to humanize Hanna.  She's whip-smart and quick to adapt, but she is also sheltered from the world.  She's never kissed a boy for example.  And when that opportunity arises she is both curious and fearful.

In her cross-continent escape to Berlin she encounters a band of gypsies in southern Spain.  Rather than brushing past this meeting, Wright lingers a bit, allowing Hanna to absorb her first real exposure to music.  There are many subtleties that raise this action drama above the norm.  When Hanna meets another teenage girl (terrific Jessica Barden) they become friends.  You can see it in their eyes as the camera closes in on their dilated pupils.  The villain in the movie it another surprise.  Cate Blanchett is the sinister CIA sector boss who authorized the experiments that led to Hanna's unusual abilities and killed her mother.  In one scene when Marissa (Blanchett) is under stress, the camera catches her upper lip quivering.

Lest one think this film is short on action, think again.  In a noteworthy scene shortly after Hanna is captured early in the movie, she escapes killing those in her way and using her lithe frame and training to slink through tunnels, ductwork, cracks and crevices.  All this while the Chemical Brother's pounding soundtrack fills the speakers.  This is grade A escapism.

The Blu ray transfer of this film is near perfect.  Filled with snowy landscapes and glowing computer banks, the film sparkles from every corner.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is of reference quality.  The speakers are constantly active is the surrounds and the LFE channel is full of lossless bass.  The sound is enveloping without become aural trickery.  Bonus features include an alternate ending, deleted scenes, an anatomy of a scene and commentary by director Joe Wright, a piece on the Chemical Bros. score and soundtrack and several other featurettes.",1315267200,2,3971,4.900900900900901

Cate Blanchet was obviously contractually obligated to be in the nonsense. All the cool music, great sets, fantastic locations, and odd audio in the world will not supply a story for a film that has none. Sorry. This film was a zero and it implied zero all throughout.

All of these movies are completely different from one another, requiring a different set of acting skills, yet Ronan is mesmerizing in them all. She has an acting range that is breathtaking to watch. The best way to enjoy this movie is to sit back, accept everything that you see without question, and enjoy the performances, especially that of Ronan. The script does suffer from some glaring credibility issues, but don't let that interfere with your enjoyment of the movie. Cinematography is superb under the masterful eye of Joe Wright's direction. He gets more mileage out of subtle facial expressions than any other director I've seen in a long long time.  The soundtrack by The Chemical Brothers is also superb and complements the action beautifully. Overall, one of the best 111 minutes you'll ever spend.",1315267200,4,937,5.006410256410256

There are times when I simply want to be immersed in the sounds and the light and the dark...and have the opportunity to see a great young actress.  For me it wasn't about the destination, but it was all about the ride.  And I wish it never ended.  Unlike others who have written here, I could have been happy sitting and watching another 2 hours.

Hanna has the grit and industrial look of the old (REAL) Nikita TV series (not the crappy new one).  The soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers fits like a glove.  If you like action, it has that, but I don't think that's the main sell feature.

Hanna creates a mood and a world.  If you like it, you will really like it.  Or, you may hate it.

The story itself is going to polarize audiences. There will be two types of viewers: The type that sees an odd action movie and the type that sees a philosophical statement on life.  Either audience is going to see the action and novelty aspects, but, as a member of the second group, the movie touches on some very relatable, tender points regarding the early stages of life and coming of age.

The entire movie is wrapped around the vague notion of Grimm's fairy tales and though it doesn't attempt to draw any direct metaphors, they certainly allude to them along the way.

This is the first movie in almost 10 years that I've intentionally watched multiple times in the theatre. It's an experience and it's as enjoyable the second time as the first.

It tries to create a story, which at first keeps you interested, but then half way through the movie, crumples and falls apart, taking you on an endless run (literally) that's as far from interesting as can be - it becomes utterly boring and you lose all interest in it. Very seldom do I feel like I've wasted time when watching a movie - this is one of those occasions.

The acting is good (for the most part), but having good actors perform on Titanic won't prevent it from sinking.

4596586,4,B0057GUD7C,"What do you get when the director of Atonement, Pride and Prejudice (2007), and The Soloist directs an action movie?  How about if La Femme Nikita and The Fifth Element's Leeloo produced a love-child?  Same answer for both:  Hanna.  And now for something completely different...

 Both brutal and emotionally delicate, this fairy tale-driven movie follows a young, female, elven-looking Jason Bourne in her journey to defeat the wicked witch.  Hanna tries to appeal to both art house critics and action movie connoisseurs, but succeeds considerably more in the ethereal former than the latter.

Hanna begins very slowly, but with no shortage of intrigue, as we are introduced to Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) and her father (Eric Bana) living in some subarctic wilderness.  They make ends meet by living off the grid with zero human interaction and hunting for self-sufficiency.  Like any father concerned for his early-teenage daughter, he randomly assaults her to test her developing martial prowess--for which she has a frightening facility.  Near bedtime Hanna is drilled to answer questions in Spanish, Italian, German...no problem.  We later learn that she also speaks Japanese and Arabic.  Just as we begin to question how this young girl could be so talented as a spy-in-training we meet her deficiency.  She has had no human or world interaction.  All of her knowledge outside of her ployglot tongue and combat grooming have been limited to a single-volume abridged encyclopedia.

 Yearning to be introduced to the world, we discover that Hanna's training has been geared to assassinate a CIA agent (Cate Blanchett) formerly assigned to her case; assigned to terminate her, having already dispatched her mother.  This plot element goes largely unexplained.  So if you craft questions about it while watching the movie, they will go unanswered.

 The movie has notably two different tones.  One is reserved for the scenes in which we see Hanna interacting with the sights, sounds, and denizens of a world she only understood through her father's explanations as if they were fairytales.  The majority of her character development is cued by a budding relationship with a posh British tween on her family vacation in Africa.  She experiences friendship, acceptance, and a near-first kiss which results in a Spanish teen almost having his neck snapped (a very Leeloo-Fifth Element moment).  Her awkward social encounters are humorous.  When asked how her mother died by the British girl's mother, Hanna casually and informatively replies: ""three bullets.""  While, at moments, this social experiment comes off as shocking, it also has its enchanting moments.  As she experiences new, simple things such as hearing music or having the wind blow in her face riding aback a motorcycle, her haunting expressions remind me of the emotional journey taken by the young, deaf Japanese girl from Babel.

 The other tone was strongly forecast by the trailer: Hanna is a stone-cold killer.  Eric Bana brought his A-game Munich bad-assery to this movie and shared a heaping spoonful of kickass awesome with his co-star.  There are several battles between Hanna and her father, as well as between each of them and various covert-types sent to kill them.  In terms of camera work and film-editing, no effort is made for the viewer to enjoy the Bourne Identity-style fighting choreography.  You ""know"" what kinds of moves are being executed, but you cannot really ""see"" it happen.  Instead, every effort is made for the viewer to experience the abrupt, brutal, purposeful nature of these trained killers.  Their techniques come off as effortless; instinctive.  Also similar to the Bourne series is how much sprinting occurs in this movie, making for a very fight-or-flight-y experience.

 Presented with many elements of fantasy--a young girl (sort of) imprisoned, naively interacting with the outside world, a ""near first"" kiss, revenge, a wicked witch, a fairy tale house, and various foreign locales--our more elf-than-human looking heroine strives to defeat her nemesis to have her revenge and gain her freedom.  Her journey ends with an ending that doesn't feel like an ending.  Rather it feels like they ""forgot"" to film the last few scenes and abruptly ""ended"" the movie on the spot.  Considering the strong, climactic, symbolic endings of fairy tales, this felt like a huge disappointment after watching an otherwise stimulating film.

 Despite some large plot holes and an ending that should earn the director a well-deserved kick in the nuts, I'd still like to offer a hard sell on seeing this movie.  It borrows from many, but is unlike any other.  I found this movie very interesting, touching and surreal.",1313798400,24,4700,5.198402130492677
4596587,2,B0057GUD7C,"I could not wait to see this movie the trailer looked so good. The idea of the moive reminded me of the ""Proffesional"" I hoped with more commitment to showing a young lady as a true killer. What we got was this confussing movie that showed this girl with the ability to kill and fight her ""father"" and special forces men but when placed in the real world her fights and kills are that of some just trained street fighter who has a hard time taking out some thug. She is confused by electricity but then has the ability to do web searches in an internet cafe. She has the super human ability to grab onto the under carriage of a fast moving humvee and hang on with out being seen.

Now what about the plot holes what every happen to the family she was travelling with? Are you telling me the father in the artic circle took a long swim from there to the mainland? Why all the running? She ran around the prison she ran around the desert she ran around the freight yard, and she ran around the fairy tale park. For a trained killer she did a lot of running.

I continued to watch the movie thinking something exciting would happen to bring the story that was paper thin together. Dead bodies where left all over the place with no police fall out. This move really lacked believeability.",1313712000,13,1284,4.301652892561983

4596589,4,B0057GUD7C,"On first glance, Erik (Eric Bana) and Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) appear to be like any other English speaking father and daughter living alone in a remote wintery wilderness portion of the Arctic Circle while spending their time foraging for food, killing large elk, studying foreign languages, and practicing lethal martial arts.  I know, common, every day stuff.  Nothing to see here; move along.  Well, it's not that simple.  It turns out Erik is a former CIA agent with a dangerous past involving Cate Blanchett, a cucumber, handcuffs, and a power dri...er...a dangerous past that could put his daughter in grave danger.  He permits Hanna to decide when she's ready to risk life and limb to traverse the world while narrowly dodging trained assassins who run brothels and team with Agent Marissa (Blanchett), a devilishly sexy and evil agent whose business-stylish appearance and foreboding background music belie her dastardly psyche resulting from previous involvement with a secret program.  Only by accomplishing the mission given by her father will Hanna realize true freedom and uncover the revelations which caused her father to push, train, and mentor her to be a prepubescent assassin.

Original?  Not terribly.  Plot holes?  Obvious ones.  Exciting nonetheless?  Absolutely.  Fueled by the Chemical Brothers synergistic soundtrack, tight editing that made every scene flow right over minor plot holes, and some seriously pulse-pounding action sequences, Hanna is a movie that doesn't tread new ground but I'd gladly walk the same footsteps again.",1313107200,16,1555,5.37603305785124

4596591,3,B0057GUD7C,"""Hanna"" is a moderately entertaining movie, worth viewing just for the terrific acting by the trio of Cate Blanchett, Saoirse Ronan, and Eric Bana. But ultimately, I can't give it that high of a rating because it lacks a heart and soul, and despite being a two hour long movie, the many action sequences squeeze out scenes or plot points that would have let us understand or feel for the major characters.

Saoirse Ronan reprises her ongoing roles as a young teenaged girl on a journey of discovery. She has played this part before, in ""City of Ember"", and ""Lovely Bones"" and is a terrific actress. Here in this movie, her hair and eyebrows and eyelashes have been bleached nearly white (she is normally a natural light brunette), giving her an ethereal quality, almost like a fairy or a wood elf. The difference in this movie is that her character is not a normal teenage girl, as we soon discover, and so she has this flat and emotionless affect through most of the movie.

Cate Blanchett, what to say except that she is again wonderful, playing this fiercely evil CIA agent. Blanchett has been one of my favorite actresses after her role as Galadriel - I couldn't imagine anybody else playing that role ever again.

Eric Bana has never been one of my favorite actors, as he seems to have cornered the market on roles as earnest but ultimately failed heroes. But he is an excellent actor.

The movie has a lot of action sequences, with lots of running. The change from one scene to another is herky jerky, as we jump from the wilderness of Finland to an underground fortress in Morocco, to a tourist campground in Morocco, to Berlin, and then once in Berlin, from a rundown amusement park to her father's apartment, to her grandmother's apartment and then back to the amusement park.

The action is also excessively stylish as if it were supposed to mean something. Why have the final denouement in an amusement park, starting in a house styled like a gingerbread fairy tale house? Why have Cate Blanchett's #1 evil henchman whistle a jaunty tune as he stalks his prey? I mean, won't that give him away?

The movie left tons of loose ends and unanswered questions at the end. The motivations of the two adult antagonists are left only partially answered. Just why was Cate Blanchett's character chasing so hard after her quarry? And why did she do all those awful things in the past? The only answer given by Eric Bana's character on his motivations for what he did is wierdly simple and unsatisfying: ""Because kids grow up"" (like duh, but don't you think a good father would want his beloved daughter to have something better in life than become a pre-programmed assassin?).

At the end of the movie, I could say only that this movie was entertaining but not memorable. Like Saoirse Ronan's character, the movie was so busy running that all the heart and soul and motivations got left out.",1312588800,14,2892,4.658823529411765
4596592,4,B0057GUD7C,"Now this is a really good movie. One of the best I've seen this year. It reminded me a lot of the Bourne films, except this time the person laying the beat downs and killing people left and right is a young girl that even Hit-Girl would envy. Basically she is trained to be a lethal assassin by her father, who has a background in the subject, in a remote cabin cut off from the outside world. Let's just say that some covert operation from years back had some loose ends that needed tying up, so of course they are now the targets, but boy did they mess with the wrong duo.

I liked the strong European feel from the locations to the small character parts throughout. It was kind of like entering a different world. Throw in some well choreographed fight scenes that don't shy away from the violence despite the PG-13 rating and you've got quite the feast. It's even peppered with a number of light hearted moments that might bring a smile to your face. The directing, camera work, writing and music were also of high caliber, but the strong level of acting on display really stole the show.

There are a number of really talented young actresses at the moment (Hailee Steinfeld and Chlo Grace Moretz for example), but Saoirse Ronan is in the same league if not even better. I had previously seen her in Atonement and The Lovely Bones and while I had issues with both of those films, she was the definite standout. Her line delivery and facial expressions continue to amaze for someone her age. This is her best role by far. You will believe she is not someone to mess with. Eric Bana is convincing as her father and Cate Blanchett turns in one of her best roles ever in my opinion. What a bad lady. Even the weirdo psycho killer working for Blanchett is memorable in a part that could have been a throwaway.

Now for some minor negatives. A couple of parts did get a little slow and once the mystery is revealed it's more of a been there done that kind of deal, but overall Hanna remains a unique blending for an action film. One that actually has the smarts to stretch beyond the genre's normal limitations.

And yes, I was so close to giving this 5 stars, but in the end I just couldn't pull the trigger.",1312502400,9,2208,4.378048780487805

4596594,5,B0057GUD7C,"What a terrific movie. A really likeable central character, whose coming-of-age journey is paralleled by a manhunt across Europe (where she is being hunted), during which she starts to learn more about the world and comes to reject violence. But that's not to say that the action scenes aren't thrilling stuff, and really enhanced by the wonderful score from the Chemical Brothers, which fits every scene in the movie where it's used (a lot of the time there's no background music, but when there is, it really adds to it) like a glove. Superb cinematography and beautiful directorial touches add what it takes to make the movie more than a clever thriller and elevate it to the status of art.

Be warned that not all of the plot is spelled out for you like in a typical Hollywood flick, so if you're not used to paying attention to subtlety, you might feel lost in the plot. If that happens, forget the plot and you'll still enjoy the movie for all of the above reasons.

No movie, however brilliant, will be treasured unless we feel we can make an emotional connection to the characters. Fortunately, Hanna won't disappoint there. We identify with Hanna and root for her, sympathise with Eric; we feel at home with the English tourist family, we hate Marissa with childlike passion, and Isaacs is all of our dark repulsions and fears covered by the thinnest social veneer. Even the old clown reminds us of some old uncle, even for those of us who never had uncles...

Wish I could give it 7 stars out of 5, but I'll just have to settle for actually watching it again.",1312329600,222,1569,4.5964285714285715
4596595,3,B0057GUD7C,"This movie is way overrated.  It's a total Bourne Identity rip off even down to the awful shaky cameras and bland colors. Hollywood shows it's typical lack of fresh ideas.  Here's the plot, in a nutshell (Spoilers Ahead).  Hanna is the last of a genetically altered/engineered group of kids that were bred to be super soldiers.  Eric Bana, a former CIA agent, kidnaps her as an infant.  He raises her out in the wilderness and trains her to be the perfect assassin.  Her mission being to kill his former boss Marissa, played adeptly by Cate Blanchette.  She fails and thus begins a massive hunt, by the CIA, for Hanna and Eric Bana.  Sounds okay, but there are a lot of problems with the movie beyond the Blair Witch quality camera work.  First of all, every one of the pursuers of Hanna are totally incompetent. Marissa goes to some weird bar, with a shemale performer, to hire some mercenaries to hunt down Hanna. You get the impression that these are tough experienced assassins that will give Hanna and Erik a run for their money.  Wrong.  What you get are just some average weak goons that seem no better than 3rd rate mob henchmen.  They make Hanna more formidable mainly by making everyone chasing her totally inept.  In one scene, a bunch of CIA agents have Erik totally surrounded.  Instead of just shooting him, they decide to brawl with him one at a time.  He takes them down one by one, until the last guy decides to pull out a gun to try to shoot him, but he's quickly taken down with a throwing knife.  Apparently, only one of them had a gun.  You get a lot of that in the movie.  Another turn off is that everyone in the movie is a bad guy.  You really have no one to root for.  I suppose you could root for Hanna, but she's a remorseless brutal killer.  Also, every character in the movie is weird.  Hanna is naturally bizarre, but every person she ""befriends"" or comes across is a scatter brained weirdo.  The worse one is her newfound friend, Sophie, who is talking machine that won't stop.  In fact she has more lines in 10 minutes of screen time than Hanna, Erik and Marissa put together for the entire film.  I kept hoping that Hanna would kill her and spare the audience from further suffering.  Oh, well.  Suffice to say, the movie ends predictably with the ""showdown"" between Marissa and Hanna.  Since Marissa is basically a pencil pusher, it's a head scratcher trying to figure out just how she would think she would have a chance against a brilliant super assassin like Hanna.  I guess we're not supposed to ask questions like that.",1312243200,8,2558,4.5

I would recommend it to anyone who would consider them self a stylistic, well rounded person. If you tend to like stylish indie flicks such as 'The Life Aquatic', 'Wristcutters', and 'Scott Pilgrim', you'll greatly enjoy and appreciate this film. If you're hesitant to buy this film because, like me, you aren't a fan of younger characters, buy it anyways. Saoirse Ronan has earned an Academy Award, as well as a Golden Globe to prove that she has what it takes to hold her own against the amazing talents of actors Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett.

At least it showed how kids can really kick-butt (although it was only a movie), rather seeing films about them child being abused, exploited etc. The first movie I saw was 'The Professional', where we can see the revengeful Mathilda Lando (twelve years old Natalie Portman's first film debut) trained to be a 'cleaner' by the best hitman in town. In 'Lawn Dogs' Devon Stockard's character (played by eleven years old Mischa Barton) defies her own father in protecting her innocent best friend from being battered to death, Mindy Macready aka the foul-mouthed Hit-Girl in 'Kick-Ass' (a physically demanding character played by the 11 years old Chloe Moretz) and Mattie Ross in 'True Grit' (gaining Hailee Steinfeld an Oscar nomination). Now come Hanna Heller aka `HANNA' (played by the talented Irish rose, Saoirse Ronan), about a trained child assassin going on a mission sent by her father. The movie was being directed by 'Atonement' director, Joe Wright, of Ronan's previous film. With the combination of both actress and director, will sure bring the audience the feeling of how the story will end.

4596598,2,B0057GUD7C,"I won't pull any punches: HANNA is just plain awful. It's a movie with multiple personalities that don't mesh. It's almost like the 3 main actors, Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana, and Cate Blanchett, are in three separate movies that occasionally bump into each other and none of them make sense. The basic plot is that Cate Blanchett is a CIA manager, and Eric Bana used to be one of her agents about 15 years before. They were involved in a Super Soldier experiment that came to an end at which point, Bana was supposed to kill all the participants. He didn't. Instead, he takes baby Hanna into hiding and trains her up to be a lethal asset. Why? Because Bana thinks Blanchett will come for her. After 15 years. So what does he do? He turns on a homing beacon to tell Blanchett here they're hiding. Why? And why would she care after 15 years? Then all heck breaks loose after which Ronan goes on a coming-of-age odyssey I won't bore you with. And then it ends.

HANNA has kinds of Felini-esque imagery which just adds to the what-the...? factor. If you like quirky, stream of conscious movies, then you might like HANNA. But you couldn't get me to watch it again for all the Pecan Sandies in the Keebler Treehouse.",1312070400,17,1209,4.470588235294118

I thought the acting on behalf of all the main characters were phenominal as well.  The plot kept you on the edge of your seat and jumpting through the entire movie as you never did know what was going to happen next, and when.

But when it ended, my wife turned to me and asked, ""What was the point of that?""  And I had to think about it because, she was right, the action was good and the story came to some sort of closure, but there was zero character development.  Yeah, Hanna learns a few things about who she was and her past, but her character arc didn't show any growth.  She didn't have to overcome anything.  In fact, almost everything placed in her way as an obstacle seemed too easy for her to resolve.  She didn't grow any, she only learned new information going from scene to scene almost like a robot following her program.  It wouldn't surprise me if they made a sequel and revealed that she is, indeed, a robot.  (Okay, I'd be surprised, but not blown away)

And because of this, I can't give this a 5 star rating because that is a major flaw in any story.  So see it for the action.  Enjoy it for the special effects, gun fights, and car chases.

Hanna tries to appeal to both art house critics and action movie connoisseurs, but succeeds considerably more in the ethereal former than the latter.

Hanna begins very slowly, but with no shortage of intrigue, as we are introduced to Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) and her father (Eric Bana) living in some subarctic wilderness.  They make ends meet by living off the grid with zero human interaction and hunting for self-sufficiency.  Like any father concerned for his early-teenage daughter, he randomly assaults her to test her developing martial prowess--for which she has a frightening facility.  Near bedtime Hanna is drilled to answer questions in Spanish, Italian, German...no problem.  We later learn that she also speaks Japanese and Arabic.  Just as we begin to question how this young girl could be so talented as a spy-in-training we meet her deficiency.  She has had no human or world interaction.  All of her knowledge outside of her ployglot tongue and combat grooming have been limited to a single-volume abridged encyclopedia.

 Yearning to be introduced to the world, we discover that Hanna's training has been geared to assassinate a CIA agent (Cate Blanchett) formerly assigned to her case; assigned to terminate her, having already dispatched her mother.  This plot element goes largely unexplained.  So if you craft questions about it while watching the movie, they will go unanswered.

 The movie has notably two different tones.  One is reserved for the scenes in which we see Hanna interacting with the sights, sounds, and denizens of a world she only understood through her father's explanations as if they were fairytales.  The majority of her character development is cued by a budding relationship with a posh British tween on her family vacation in Africa.  She experiences friendship, acceptance, and a near-first kiss which results in a Spanish teen almost having his neck snapped (a very Leeloo-Fifth Element moment).  Her awkward social encounters are humorous.  When asked how her mother died by the British girl's mother, Hanna casually and informatively replies: ""three bullets.""  While, at moments, this social experiment comes off as shocking, it also has its enchanting moments.  As she experiences new, simple things such as hearing music or having the wind blow in her face riding aback a motorcycle, her haunting expressions remind me of the emotional journey taken by the young, deaf Japanese girl from Babel.

 The other tone was strongly forecast by the trailer: Hanna is a stone-cold killer.  Eric Bana brought his A-game Munich bad-assery to this movie and shared a heaping spoonful of kickass awesome with his co-star.  There are several battles between Hanna and her father, as well as between each of them and various covert-types sent to kill them.  In terms of camera work and film-editing, no effort is made for the viewer to enjoy the Bourne Identity-style fighting choreography.  You ""know"" what kinds of moves are being executed, but you cannot really ""see"" it happen.  Instead, every effort is made for the viewer to experience the abrupt, brutal, purposeful nature of these trained killers.  Their techniques come off as effortless; instinctive.  Also similar to the Bourne series is how much sprinting occurs in this movie, making for a very fight-or-flight-y experience.

 Presented with many elements of fantasy--a young girl (sort of) imprisoned, naively interacting with the outside world, a ""near first"" kiss, revenge, a wicked witch, a fairy tale house, and various foreign locales--our more elf-than-human looking heroine strives to defeat her nemesis to have her revenge and gain her freedom.  Her journey ends with an ending that doesn't feel like an ending.  Rather it feels like they ""forgot"" to film the last few scenes and abruptly ""ended"" the movie on the spot.  Considering the strong, climactic, symbolic endings of fairy tales, this felt like a huge disappointment after watching an otherwise stimulating film.

 Despite some large plot holes and an ending that should earn the director a well-deserved kick in the nuts, I'd still like to offer a hard sell on seeing this movie.  It borrows from many, but is unlike any other.  I found this movie very interesting, touching and surreal.",1309564800,,4700,5.198402130492677
4596601,3,B0057GUD7C,"HANNA struck me as equal parts awesome and utterly confusing. It's a character-driven action movie, but without any real clarity as to why the characters behave the way they do. An OCD villain, a weaponized child, and some random guy who lives inside an amusement park ride all combined to make fascinating characters that made no sense to me. The cinematography and acting are simply stunning. There is a very ""artsy"" feel to the movie, as if things were left purposefully for the reader to interpret. However, the lack of understood motivation left the plot wanting. I left saying: ""Wow!"" And: ""What was that?"" And not always in a good way. (3 Stars)",1307836800,,652,4.778761061946903
4596602,4,B0057GUD7C,"A rudimentary summary of the film's plot is an adolescent girl is kept in isolation and trained to be an assassin. But it's so much more than that. The film is a hyperbolic take on a modern day Grimm's Fairy tale. Most people forget these fairy tales were originally meant to teach children about the dangers of the woods (world) as they were meant to entertain. And such is the tale of Hanna, whose father teachers her about the dangers of the world and tries his best to protect her from the wicked world and the wicked ""queen' out to see her slain.

This film gets a bit heavy on the Brother's Grimm analogies and symbolism, but has great, Bourne-esque action sequences, wonderful characters and performances (even though Cate Blanchett's Southern accent is kind of awful) and an intriguing plot.

The only difference is that in this movie, the central figure (Hanna) is female. First, there is a super assassin developed as a result of a covert CIA program, then we see her kill CIA operatives. As a result, the CIA is out to kill her. Just like the Bourne movies, this also includes the appearance of an endless number of men either hired killers or in combat gear like soldiers sent to hunt her down. There is even a scene in which Hannna dives off a wharf into black waters to escape death from an assassin, just like Jason Bourne did. There is nothing original here lending to its boring progression. Cinema-wise, the movie is a knock-off. At the box office, it's a rip-off.

4596605,2,B0057GUD7C,"Director Joe Wright steps away from prestige Oscar bait like ""The Soloist"" and ""Atonement"" to drop a loud, fast, violent graphic novel of a movie.

The film -- about a young girl trained to exact brutal revenge on a high-level spook -- can't quite rise past its extremely familiar story and characters.

While it has style to spare, a lot of its quirkier elements feel completely contrived (circles are a recurring, heavy-handed motif), and an odd, jolting score by The Chemical Brothers at times makes the picture feel more adventurous than it actually is.

Villainess Cate Blanchett -- totally channeling Tilda Swinton -- has killer suits, cool hair and a mind-boggling sorta-Southern accent, but she and the other bad guys never really seem all that threatening when placed against Saoirse Ronan's pint-sized assassin.

Two key fights scenes -- one in a ship yard; the other, an eye-popping real-time six-on-one brawl in a subway station -- are high points.",1304121600,2,960,5.056962025316456
4596606,2,B0057GUD7C,"I will keep this review short, but must disagree with many of the other reviews of this film that praise its artistry.
The premise is interesting and original-a girl is being raised by her father in a cabin deep in the arctic woods, and has not encountered the outside world yet, even though she is now 16. Her father has trained her in a vast array of survival skills, including hunting wild game with a bow and arrow, and impressive martial arts. She is strong, fearless, very tough. The time comes to let her experience the real world, and through a series of plot devices, she is carried by helicopter to Europe, where she  immediately encounters all kinds of people who want her to be killed. At this point i found the film to be alternately ridiculous or boring. The reasons why people want her dead are unclear. The main antagonist Marissa, played by Cate Blanchett, pursues her all over the countryside and we don't ever really know why. She enlists various henchmen along the way to help her, and MUCH screen time is used having Hanna running away from danger. Gratuitous violence abounds, with good guys and bad guys alike getting brutally murdered. The various plot turns seem irrelevant and do not hold together well as a story. Although this film appears to be attempting to create the suspense and intricacy of the Bourne Identity series, I think it fails and relies far too heavily on violence and the ""action"" of having Hanna in constant motion as she flees her pursuers.",1303948800,2,1487,4.675572519083969

4596608,4,B0057GUD7C,"""Hanna"" is a ruthless, relentless, chase featuring a teen girl assassin. It's violent and suspenseful, fast and cruel. The chase sprawls over travelogue settings in the Arctic Circle, North Africa, and Berlin. It's like the Bourne movies, like Daniel Craig's Bond movies. The difference is, of course, that the hero is not a muscle-bound adult male, but a barely muscled teenage girl, Saorise Ronan. And the focus never waivers from the chase. Hanna gets no love interest.

I generally don't go to movies I know are going to be violent and I have walked out of violent films, but I loved ""Hanna"" and kept my eyes open throughout almost all of it. It's not just that Hanna, the assassin, is a girl, and I'm female, too, although that was part of it. ""Hanna"" depicts Hanna as having an admirable work ethic, and as being an underdog. The one thing that separates her from the people she so determinedly wounds, beats, stabs, and kills is that she is just following the pedagogical training of her admirably dedicated, old-school patriarch, Erik (Eric Bana.) Erik raised his girl to know how to read, write, and kill. He did this for a righteous reason. The people Erik trained Hanna to kill are very, very bad people, and the audience wants them dead, as well. The morality and worldview of ""Hanna"" is very much that of the setting of its opening scene: the harsh north. This is Nordic morality, where even if you do the right thing, you may end up dead, anyway. There is no reward. If you don't end up dead, and live on, you live on only to keep fighting in a harsh, unforgiving landscape.

Saorise Ronan gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Hanna. She truly inhabits a character whose sole focus is on struggle. She enters every new landscape, from a treeless desert to a hotel room, with the focus of a wild animal: where is the food? Where is something to drink? From what direction will danger come? How will I meet it? Ronan never once slips up, never once behaves as a comfortable teenage girl would behave. She has a killer's eyes throughout the entire film. I have to wonder if this wasn't a tough film for her to make. Playing Hanna would have given me nightmares.

The film's ruthlessness becomes a bit of a failing. The film is so ready to wound and kill characters the audience wants to like, so ready to turn sweet moments into deadly poison, so ready to let any landscape become a death trap, that I did get a bit jaded about 75% into the film. I was no longer surprised when a character showed some humanity only to be dispatched in the most hateful of ways. But the film threw some new plot developments in at that point, and it kept my interest.

Cate Blanchett is terrific as Hanna's foil. Eric Bana is solid as her dedicated teacher and father. The supporting cast, including Tom Hollander and Olivia Williams, is all very good.

The Chemical Brothers' soundtrack is perfect. I often don't even hear soundtracks the first time I watch a movie, and when I do notice them, it is, all too often, because they are intrusive and trying to do the work of wrenching emotions that poor filmmaking could not do. During one breathless scene in ""Hanna,"" I realized that the post-Apocalyptic soundtrack geared me up and made me tense and brought me into the scene in a very enjoyable way.",1303603200,7,3294,4.5857385398981325
4596609,4,B0057GUD7C,"I love action films and I love the actor Eric Bana from the movie Munich. Hanna is a very good movie filled with great action and good characterizations. You feel like you really get to know the people, a rarity in action films.

Eric Bana raises Hanna in a remote area of Finland where he trains her to be a ninja warrior of the fiercest and quickest kind. He has her on the alert even while she is sleeping. She knows that her mother died, ""shot be three bullets"" but knows little else about her life. As she learns more about who she is and what she is, she begins an existential crisis.

Eric Bana tells Hanna that when she is ready, she should press a button on the CB radio in their Finnish cottage and people will know where they are. It is then her responsibility to kill the woman played by Cate Blanchett or be killed by her. Hanna goes out on her own and has one adventure after another. They are poignant, heartwarming, adrenaline rushing, and edge of your seat action scenes. Hanna plays the part of a warrior/idiot savant brilliantly. She can recite facts about most anything but knows little or nothing about human emotion.

Overall, I recommend the movie. I don't know the name of the actress who plays Hanna, but she is great. She played Brioney in Atonement.",1303516800,,1276,4.444444444444445
4596610,5,B0057GUD7C,"I'll admit I didn't know what to expect from Hanna before going in. I had only seen the trailer once and barely remembered what was shown. And, I saw this in the D-BOX section of the screening room, which means motion seats. I'd figured this movie was pretty exciting if it was gonna be shown in D-box.

And, as a result, it was. This is definitely the best movie to be released so far this year. There's a lot of garbage floating out there like ""Your Highness"" and ""Red Riding Hood"". Finally, a movie that is equally as thought-provoking as it is action packed and thrilling.

Hanna is a 14 year old girl, an assassin since a child. She lives with her father, Erik, in a hut in the woods, who has trained her to be an assassin, and has kept her in the woods from day one, after the murder of the mother. As the film starts, ""the time is right""- Hanna is ready to see the outside world, and so Erik sends her on a mission to meet him in Berlin... and to help successfully get revenge on Marissa, an American intelligence agent bent on killing both Hanna and Erik.

And that's all you need to know- because Hanna is a high-octane, gripping, and totally action-packed movie that, the less you knew about, the more you will enjoy it.

Saoirse Ronan is just insanely amazing as the titular character. I'll be honest, I liked her more than Chloe Moertz in Kick-Ass. I was not surprised to find out she did most of the action herself, because I swear, it was just a thrill to watch. Cate Blanchett is stunning, hilarious, and sexy in her role as Marissa- and her southern drawl is great!!!! I actually thought she did a fantastic job. But, the real show-stealer is Eric Bana. He was a total badass, his performance was just fantastic and he seemed really into it.

In addition, the cinematography is great too. Gorgeous scenery and good camera work in the action scenes too- even the rather gimmicky upside down shots were great. The suspense is high throughout, there's a LOT of suspense, and the last 20 minutes are an intense nail biter, especially the twist ending.

Oh, and in addition, if this is playing in a D-box theatre near you, see it. The motion seats just add to the intensity of the film.

In short, do not miss this intense experience. It is by far the best movie to be released in 2011, and there is not a single dull moment!",1303430400,4,2336,4.393518518518518

Cate Blanchett does a great job in her hard-edge spymaster role. Eric Bana plays a minor part in the drama, however large his part in getting the plot under way. Saoirse Ronan, however, walks away with the title role. Her delicate features and lean grace seem at odds with her vicious role, and the director makes the most of that contradiction. The paradox only builds when Hanna connects with another young girl - the contrast of one girl's chatty, knowing daydreams with the other's gritty and uncertain nightmares might make you look at any girl differently, knowing that both extremes might lie within one young frame.

Think of a kitten: cute, yes, but trained by its parents to kill. Hanna is that kind of kitten.

I liked this film. I liked it a lot.

Come to think of it, I like all of director Joe Wright's films. Each seems to be crafted by someone who is truly in love with the art of filmmaking. This would seem like a prerequisite for any film, but sadly, I don't believe it is. Beginning with his version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" in 2005, through ""Atonement"", ""The Soloist"" and now ""Hanna"", he brings a unique sensibility to each, giving each film a different look, a different feel and a different style. While he makes each film unique, he also uses enough of the genre or theme to make it recognizable, allowing our vision of these stories to expand along with him. I mean, it would be pretty silly to watch a version of ""Pride"" that doesn't at least acknowledge the source material by Jane Austen. But Wright is smart enough to realize he can only push the envelope so far and shows some restraint.

Hanna (Saoirse Ronan, ""Atonement"") has been raised in the forest by her father, Erik (Eric Bana). They spend their days and nights together in a small cabin living about as far off the grid as humanly possible. Erik spends his time training Hanna to survive; they engage in elaborate fights, hunt, learn to survive in the tundra, teaching Hanna to become strong, to fight against the best of them. Her skill set is amazing, wide and varied, but as a sixteen-year-old teenage girl, she begins to miss something in her life. As she asks questions, Erik begins to realize what she wants. One day, he digs up a small beacon he buried long ago and brings it back to the cabin. If Hanna really wants to see the real world, all she has to do is turn the beacon on. As soon as she does this, Marissa Vigler (Cate Blanchett), a CIA operative, will begin to hunt them. A couple of days later, Erik returns from a hunt to find the beacon blinking. They make arrangements to meet in Berlin and he is off. Hanna waits and soon, a helicopter arrives. She puts up token resistance and soon finds herself in a strange holding facility. She asks to speak with Marissa Vigler and all hell breaks loose.

An interesting thing to note about this film is that the screenplay by Seth Lochhead and David Farr (who wrote some episodes of the British TV series ""MI: 5"") was listed on both the 2006 and 2009 Blacklist, an annual list of the best-unproduced screenplays circulating in Hollywood. It is kind of easy to see why this screenplay was not immediately snapped up and produced. ""Hanna"" is a character-driven action film. Most action films are story-driven and directors embrace this because it gives them an excuse to blow up buildings and to choreograph elaborate action sequences. In ""Hanna"", the characters are the heart of the story, and we spend a lot of time with them, learning about them, watching them navigate this world. There are some terrific action set-pieces, but they aren't the main focus of the film. In fact, in a couple of these, the director seems to believe they aren't important to the characters and we watch only the aftermath of the fight before it. We'll return to this later. But I feel like story-driven action films are more popular, more acceptable for most filmmakers because they don't have to spend too much time on character development, they can concentrate their energy on elaborate explosions, kick-ass car chases and fancy fights.

Joe Wright deserves a lot of credit for recognizing how well-written and how unique this story is and for sticking to the strange and unusual aspect of the screenplay.

There are a lot of unusual touches to the visuals of this story. From the very beginning, when we first join Hanna and Erik in the snow-bound forest, everything appears almost monochromatic. They are living in a world blanketed with white and the wood and animal skins surrounding them provide dark, vibrant slashes of black and gray. Both Hanna and Erik are very pale, their wild hair frequently covered with snow. Even after Hanna is captured and taken to the holding facility, the images remain monochromatic. But now, everything is very gray (lots of concrete and metal) and orange (the surrounding desert and her prison garb, for lack of a better word). As the story moves to Morocco, then France, then Berlin, Hanna seems to find herself in dirty, unkempt areas. Especially when she gets to Berlin, the area she populates seems uncared for, nothing has been painted in a many years and seems faded of all vitality. It is an easier place to go unnoticed. This also helps to carry on with the washed out, monochromatic feel of the film.

When Hanna is held in the unknown facility, it appears like it was originally constructed in the 70s, lots of curves and circular shapes, everything appears a little grimy. This gives us the message she is in a facility that hasn't been used in a while, and now seems to be dusting off the cobwebs. When she eventually escapes, Wright embraces the nature of the facility and really throws us into a different kind of action film. He creates a montage of incredibly brief shots and very quick editing to give us more of a feel of her escape. This sequence seems to pay homage to films of the 70s, borrowing the same sort of editing aesthetic Kubrik, Friedkin and Yates might have used. Lots of brief shots, lots of close-ups of shapes and images, blurry transitions, shots turning and twisting. In a way, this aesthetic also helps us remember that Hanna is new to this world and everything must seem strange and new to her.

Because Wright is more interested in the characters, he spends a lot of time with Hanna and Erik, establishing who they are, what makes them interesting. There are moments of violence, of fighting, but these seem abbreviated somehow. As mentioned before, in many instances, we witness the aftermath of a fight or a violent episode. This does two things. First, it allows our mind to fill in the details of what happened just before. Generally, our minds will fill in more graphic details, more blood, so this is an effective technique to get us involved in the story. It is the same technique that makes a good horror film good. When we don't see everything in explicit detail, our mind fills in the blanks, making it scarier. Second, it reminds us the characters are king and in control of the story in this film.

When we do see the action, it is top notch. Hanna's escape from the holding facility is fast-paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Various fist fights are elaborately choreographed and interesting. A gun battle is very quick and leaves your heart racing.

But Wright is clearly more interested in character. After Hanna escapes the holding facility, she walks through the Moroccan desert and happens upon a British family traveling in an old caravan. Dad (Jason Flemyng) and Mom (Olivia Williams) are eager for their children, Sophie (Jessica Barden), a teenager trying to live beyond her years, and Miles (Aldo Maland), to live a rich life in the country, full of travel. When Hanna and Sophie meet, Sophie seems to consider this new, unusual friend a trophy and she wants her around for a while. This sequence of the film seems to diverge from the real story. Hanna basically lives with them for a while as they travel. And as this seems to go on forever, a realization happens. Hanna is learning how to be a, more of less, normal teenage girl from Sophie. It actually works and gives us a deeper feeling for Hanna.

Also, during this sequence, Wright continues to revisit Erik, Marissa and a strange German assassin played by Tom Hollander, keeping us grounded  and making the sequence seem more integrated into Hanna and Erik's story.

Saoirse Ronan is really good as Hanna. She is mature beyond her years but also nave and lacking in the life experiences most of us have in their first sixteen years. Because of this, Hanna is unsure of most of what she is experiencing as soon as she enters the real world. But she knows Marissa is out to get her, so with every challenge she adapts quickly and moves on.

Ronan shows us all of Hanna's vulnerabilities while demonstrating her unique skills. One moment, she may be staring wide-eyed at a television because it is the first one she has ever seen. The next, she is running through a maze of shipping containers trying to elude a trio of assassins. This duality runs throughout the film and helps us get a better picture of this very mature young lady who can kill people with her bare hands yet wonders what the world really holds for her.

Eric Bana is good as Erik. He is a strange fellow and we wonder for quite a while why he has brought his daughter to this small cabin in the woods, to raise her in such extreme isolation. There are a couple of flashbacks giving us the back-story to his character and his relationship with Marissa. A highly efficient killer, he has confidence in his daughter's ability to survive.

Blanchett plays Marissa Vigler, a CIA operative who is working for and towards her own agenda. As she tracks Hanna and Erik, we learn about their relationship and the reasons for her nearly psychotic determination. She really wants to get to Erik and Hanna and we get the sense that much of this is due to her personal relationship with them. She is holding a grudge or wants to clean up a mistake and will stop at nothing until she reaches her goals.

Blanchett is great. Using a sort of Southern twang, you never, ever feel Marissa relaxes. Yes, she smiles and tries to be personable, but there always seems to be a tightly wound rubber band underneath, ready to snap.

Wright quickly and efficiently convinces us of each character's determination to succeed, to beat their adversaries. This builds a lot of tension between the trio and helps to keep our attention riveted to the screen.

""Hanna"" is a real treat. A character-driven action film filled with interesting, unusual performances and a hybrid visual style. I think Joe Wright has just been elevated to the short list of directors who make films I have to see on opening weekend.",1303171200,26,10039,4.645633802816901
4596613,5,B0057GUD7C,"I went into seeing Hanna not expecting much. Boy, was I blown away.

The story is about a girl, Hanna, who lives in the cold tundra worldness with her father, and he's always training her. Hanna is strong, smart, fast, deadly, and a force to be reckoned with. Hanna decides that he needs to live in the ""real"" world, and feels she has the necessary skills to do so.  Her father leaves it up to her to decide, and she does. Soon, the CIA is after Hanna, to kill her and her father. As the story goes on, we find things out about Hanna, as she discovers things about herself, and who she really is.  Hanna just wants to be left alone, but the CIA won't let her be. Fine, if the CIA wants a war, then Hanna has no problem giving them what they want.

It was interesting to see Hanna adapt and cope in the real world. Things that you and I take for granted, she has to discover and get used to.

As the viewer, we have such an emotional connection to Hanna.  We get to know her on such a personal basis that we can't help but to root for her when she starts busting heads.  We're right along with her as she makes decisions, and we feel what she's feeling when she has to face consequences  of her decisions.

The casting is top notch.  The girl that plays Hanna is perfect, as well are the bad guys. We love to hate them, and when Hanna takes them out, we can't help but to smile.

Another fantastic aspect to the movie is the musical score. It has to be one of my favorites that I've seen in any movie.  This adds a wonderful touch to it.

4596614,4,B0057GUD7C,"This is a great action adventure movie with a lovable heroine, a teenage girl was raised in the wilderness by her ex-CIA father.  She was trained to be skilled in violence, and taught all kinds of facts about the outside world, but she has never left her home in the forest.  Now she is sent out into the world on a deadly mission, and we are along for the ride.  I was expecting more of an action film, but overall I am glad the film instead focuses on the character of Hanna, and her personal journey to find her place in a world that isn't nearly as dangerous as she is.

Hanna is a great character.  Visually she looks rather otherworldly, which drives home the point of her being an outsider.  From her faded appearance to her out of place clothes, she looks like someone who just doesn't belong.  And that's before she opens her mouth and starts spouting a bunch of random facts that she knows because her father read her encyclopedias instead of bedtime stories when she was little.  The only fiction in her upbringing was a book of Grimm's Fairy Tales.  (There are several references to fairy tales throughout the movie, and the plot is very much in that fanciful mold.)  But the thing that really separates Hanna from the world she is visiting is not how she was raised, but what she is.  She is a born killer, a person who is by nature more dangerous than the rest of humanity.  The film lets the action take a backseat when Hanna meets Sophie, a normal girl, and her family.  Her attempts to fit in and her discovery of just how different she is from everyone else gives the film its heart, as well as its few laughs.  Sometimes self-discovery can be more dangerous than fighting assassins.

The film has a few flaws.  Most of these involve unanswered questions, and things that don't quite get resolved.  Put simply, it leaves you wanting a little more.  For instance, the villain of the piece seems like she has depths that are never fully explored.  You find out what she did to make her a target of our teenage assassin, but you never really get to know why she made the choices she did.  Her character remains largely a mystery even after the final credits roll.  And the ending, while very good, leaves you wondering where things go from there.

Overall, I liked the movie a lot.  ""Hanna"" is a cool modern-day fairy tale, complete with the Wicked Witch.  But in this fairy tale, Hanna isn't some frail child lost in the woods.  She's the wolf.",1302998400,5,2460,4.461883408071749
4596615,5,B0057GUD7C,"""Hanna?"" Is awesome. That is all the review you need. GO SEE IT NOW!!!

Seriously, prepare to be amazed. I think this film appeals to everyone, whether you are into action films or indie art films, or both. Hanna (played brilliantly by the young Saoirse Ronan) was raised in the forest by her father (Eric Bana). She has never had any contact with the outside world, and although she is quite intelligent, she is oblivious to many aspects of life. For example, she has never seen a television or heard music...and she doesn't really understand what she's missing out on. Hanna has also been raised as a soldier, and has been being groomed for a mission: her father wants her to murder an American agent (the always incredible Cate Blanchett) who killed her mother. Anxious to leave the forest, fulfill her responsibility, and get on with her life, Hanna embarks on a crazy and dangerous journey that will take her across Europe as she fights for her survival and discovers the secrets of her past.

I absolutely loved this movie. It isn't cliche in any way. The pacing is great throughout the film, and I was deeply engrossed in the story from beginning to end. The acting is superb (LOVE Cate Blanchett's American accent!) and the cinematography is fantastic. There are so many great scenes and sequences that are unique and energized and so different from traditional films. It's a real pleasure to watch. The many fight scenes and the final scenes at the carnival are especially fantastic. I suppose my only gripe is that you don't really get an epilogue of what happens after the final scene, but I'm the kind of person who hates having any loose ends in a movie, and I realize that not everyone is like that, so this may not bother everyone.

Overall, ""Hanna"" is awesome. You'll want to see this one in the theatre.",1302652800,3,1820,4.663551401869159
4596616,4,B0057GUD7C,"In the film's opening moments a teenaged girl stalks a caribou in the frozen wilderness and soon shoots it with an arrow. Approaching to deliver the coup de grce she softly informs the caribou, ""I just missed your heart."" And, at that moment, there's this premonition that we'll hear that line again somewhere down the pipe. For Hanna, it's all part of her lifelong training as an assassin, this girl rigorously tutored by her father and raised in snow-capped desolation somewhere near the Arctic Circle. It's frigid living, in more ways than one.

Consider the fairy tale overtones which lend a perverse swerve to this stylish thriller. We note this as early as when Hanna leafs thru a Brothers Grimm picture book, and much later when she wanders into a wondrous home that is gigged out like Hansel and Gretel's enchanted cottage. There comes a time when school ends and the student graduates. Hanna feels that she's ready to step out into the world and fulfill her mission, the one for which she'd been prepping all her life. There's a switch that she must flip, for some reason.

The filmmakers inject an introspective approach into the mechanics of an action thriller. The story sort of comes at you from an oblique angle, in the sense that not everything is spelled out for the viewer. We never do learn the entire back story regarding Hanna's parents and Marissa, the steely American intelligence officer (Cate Blanchett). Marissa's motivations aren't fully explored. We're not quite certain as to why she's so gung ho to capture Hanna, besides that obvious reason wherein Hanna poses too great a security risk if left to her own devices. But watching Erik (Hanna's dad) and Marissa's interactions, there's a vibe there.

To serve as a grounding element and a counterpoint to Hanna's surreal existence, the screenplay introduces a normal English family, holidaying thru Morocco, with whom Hanna meets and gets involved. The best moments for me aren't those in which Hanna goes all assassin-y and wipes the floor with CIA henchmen. The best moments are when Hanna is learning about and reacting to the outside world, and a huge part of this consists of her observing this Brit family. Hanna strikes a tentative friendship with the British teen Sophie (Jessica Barden) who is the first ever girl that Hanna meets - and she first meets her during a frantic escape attempt. In her initial dialogue with Sophie, Hanna realizes that her rote responses don't quite cut it in the real world.

The three leads are impeccable. Eric Bana toes that line between the father who loves his daughter but is chary with affection because he knows he has to eventually throw her to the wolves, and she must learn self-reliance. There's a pronounced brittleness to Cate Blanchett's character. She adds interesting quirks to her abstractly vile CIA operative but makes sure that she remains unlikable. And, up to the end, we wonder at the nature of her relationship with Hanna and her father. Saoirse Ronan, who plays Hanna, is mesmerizing. There's a riveting stillness about her. There are times when Ronan is simply just there, taking it all in, her character soaking in all the new experiences. The camera often pans in on her face and hones in on her eyes, which are haunting and expressive. You sense a palpable melancholy beneath the stoic facade. You just want to hug the girl, introduce her to the MTV channel or give her an iPod or something (Before venturing out of the Arctic Circle, Hanna had never been exposed to music). But then you realize that, that air of vulnerability aside, this girl won't hesitate to put a bullet in you if she thinks it needed doing.

I expected more action from HANNA, and then I learned in the watching that the writers and director opted to inject more brains to the plot to complement the brawn. The tone is moody and pensive, and this - along with Hanna's journey of self-discovery - serves to lend more credence to the big action scenes when they do come along. It's worth noting that the high octane score by the Chemical Brothers ratchets up the tension that much more. Those moments in which Saoirse Ronan struts her badassery are worth checking out. She's showcased in three main set pieces. The first is when she breaks out of the CIA's impregnable fortress. The second is the fighty fight over at the shipping warehouse. Finally, there is her showdown with the wicked witch. See how I brought it all back to the fairy tale element?",1302566400,6,4468,4.78988326848249
4596617,3,B0057GUD7C,"HANNA is a great example of a film where style and attitude trumps (or nearly) substance and logic.  It's a super-cool looking movie that feels like it is better than it really is.

Young Saoirse Ronan (ATONEMENT, THE LOVELY BONES) gives an MVP performance as a teen-age killer.  Raised since she was a baby by Erik (Eric Bana) her father in the middle of what looks like northern Finland...she knows almost nothing of how life works in the civilized world.  Growing up in a wild, snow-shrouded environ, Erik has taught her everything she needs to know about hand-to-hand combat, firearms, bows & arrows, etc., as well as given her an education in languages and practically encouraged her to memorize an encyclopedia.  Erik, you see, is a former CIA agent who is on the run from his bosses, because he ""knows too much"" about some nefarious and unsavory program.  He's raising Hanna to be able to survive on her own, because one day, he knows they'll be separated and she needs to be prepared to fight her way to freedom.

That day comes when Hanna insists she's ready to live in the real world.  So Erik pulls out a homing beacon that basically tells his pursuers exactly where to find him and when they show up, Erik has already fled, but Hanna turns herself over to them.  It's never explained why they feel they must take such a loud, noisy, bloody re-entry into society...except that apparently it's worth risking both their lives to try to kill Erik's former boss/handler, Marissa (Cate Blanchett).

Hanna DOES escape, in grand style, and begins her journey to reunite with her father.  Along the way, she is befriended by various colorful ""ordinary"" people and we see how ill-prepared Hanna is to interact with society.  She's smart & dangerous, but also touchingly helpless and nave.  She is pursued by some nasty characters (this movie does NOT make Germans or Germany look very appealing) as she flees from Morocco to Berlin.

A few folks have compared Ronan to the killer girl played by Chloe Grace-Moretz in KICK-A**...but they similarities are very slender.  Moretz was a fast -and-foul talking little sparkplug, world-wise and eager to pile up bodies.  Hanna is slow to speech and is wild-eyed and wondering at the world.

This is Ronan's movie and she totally steals it.  She is a totally striking figure, in her nearly white hair and white eyebrows, with piercing eyes.  But she continues to amaze as an actress as well...totally convincing as a killer, but also believable as just a teenager who has led a sheltered life.  This character is very interesting & engaging, and we root for her.

Bana is fairly bland, but the role is bland.  Blanchett is over-the-top, and proves once and for all (after INDIANA JONES) that she is NOT cut out to play a cartoonish villainess.  She puts on a terrible Southern accent and gives a performance utterly without menace.  I normally love her, but she was quite terrible in HANNA.  (I did enjoy Tom Hollander as the primary assassin chasing Hanna.  He brought a convincing level of creepiness to his performance.)

Director Joe Wright uses his exotic locations well and stages some nifty little action scenes.  There are a lot of shots of Hanna simply running with great urgency, but they reminded me of Franka Potente in RUN LOLA RUN...gripping in their simplicity.

But behind the style, I found a frustrating plot.  Motivations were often sketchy.  Characters behaved in ways that didn't entirely make sense.  The bad guys seemed more adept at crossing the globe than was reasonable.  And this is one of those films where MANY innocent people die so that just two people can live.  Hanna and her father are not important enough to justify the deaths and torturing of so many others...especially folks who befriend Hanna only to die painfully later.

And the climax of the film lacks punch.  The best action sequences come early.  I know the end is supposed to have more emotional heft, but because we don't really care that much about the Blanchett & Bana, the lack of a really spectacular climactic chase or battle really left me with a deflated feeling when the credits began to roll.

But the character of Hanna and the performance of Ronan make the movie worth seeing.  She is a terrific young actress and has thoroughly embraced her untraditional character.  I wouldn't even mind seeing another Hanna movie...keep the visual style and cool locations, but give Hanna some really interested characters to interact with.",1302480000,9,4479,4.83442838370565
4596618,3,B0057GUD7C,"A young girl has been raised by her father to have the skills of an assassin. He is a former CIA operative, and is trying to elude the agency. The girl must meet up with her dad, while trying to evade capture. Hanna avoids becoming a run-of-the-mill action drama because of the strong performances is it two female leads, and also due to the musical score. The pulsating beats of drums and synthesizers punctuate the action, giving the film a hip and contemporary feel. The sometimes implausible feats of the girl can be overlooked due to her superb acting. She bonds with a young girl traveling with her family, and this relationship is quite endearing",1302393600,,653,4.6869565217391305
4596619,2,B0057GUD7C,"Marisa (Cate Blanchette) is a CIA agent who was in charge some years ago of an experiment to modify the DNA of babies in the uterus to try to create a better soldier. They used 20 babies of mothers who were considering abortion anyway. The project was terminated and Marisa killed all the babies and people involved as a cover up. Hanna was the only baby to escape with the help of another CIA agent named Erik. He then raised her as his daughter while hiding in the Arctic. There he trained her to be an assassin with the eventual goal of killing Marisa. The movie is about Marisa trying to kill Hanna and Erik and vice versa. Many innocent people who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time were killed, mostly by Cate and her minions. All for this lame cover up. The acting, directing, and cinematography were good. But without a story you could care about, how good could it be?",1302393600,3,894,4.359281437125748
4596620,4,B0057GUD7C,"So, let me start my review by saying the music was Perfect for the movie & just Awesome!
The acting of Saoirse Ronan was very good! She fit her Character very well in this movie.
Her Character seems to go through a lot to meet her goals...
Cate Blanchett did a great job as well in her role as the bad girl...

The action sequences were good & very believable!! Unlike a lot of movies where the cgi takes over & turns scenes into more of a circus show...

The only Con to the movie is though the action was good, there wasn't enough action in the movie.
They could have easily including more action sequences within the movie..
This movie was entertaining & the theater crowd were all watching intently throughout the entire 2 hours!

I give this movie an A-
I hope they have sequel & believe they could easily do that...
I would recommend going to see it on the Big Screen!

Thanks for reading my review!",1302307200,,905,4.305882352941176
8460678,5,B0057GUD7C,One of our current great directors. I have seen this movie at least 5 times and never get tired of it.,1528243200,,102,3.9047619047619047
8460679,5,B0057GUD7C,"Hanna is a truly blistering espionage thriller by director Joe Wright. Hanna is probably my favorite film from Wright to date. It is fast paced, exhilarating, and interesting. Wright has crafted a wholly original spy movie that oozes creativity. Every scene has cool shots and wonderfully executed panning shots. Impressive sequence after sequence line every scene of Hanna. You will be amazed and entertained by this movie for sure. Wright perfected the action film with Hanna.

Acting wise, Hanna has a delight cast of characters that emote their respective figures with surrealistic zeal. Saoirse Ronan makes for a deadly killer and a sweet heroine. She is fierce and believable as a spy, while also conveying Hanna's childish nature. Eric Bana is at his best as Hanna's tough, yet kind father. He is very cool as a spy. Cate Blanchett and Tom Hollander are two of the creepiest villains in film history. They will unsettle and threaten you. All in all, Hanna has a well cast ensemble.

Musically, Hanna is exciting and loud with a fresh electronic score from The Chemical Brothers. The bass will blast, the synths will reverberate, and the themes will soar into your ears. Hanna's soundtrack is quite memorable. I have not felt such thrills in a spy thriller since The Bourne Trilogy.

In short, Joe Wright's innovative direction focuses this neat narrative into a non-stop feature. The lovely Saoirse Ronan will captivate you throughout Hanna. You will root for her to triumph. Sit back and enjoy the music, action, acting, and direction. Hanna is divine!",1527897600,,1560,5.015444015444015
