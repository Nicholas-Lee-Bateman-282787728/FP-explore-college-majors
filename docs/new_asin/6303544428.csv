684171,4,6303544428,one of the best historical dramas i've seen. it has comedy as well as tradgedy. diane lane and donald sutherland make for an interesting pair.,1101427200,,142,4.72
684172,5,6303544428,"The film shows the social and political scene from the Civil War to the 1950s in a personal account that is wonderful to watch.  While it may not be a story that happened to only one person, the events in the film are real, they happened to thousands of American women.  Diane Lane is great and Sutherland plays the part of Captain Marsden to perfection.  I don't know why this movie is not on school library shelves everywhere.  Buy it if you can find it!",1083715200,2,456,4.329411764705882
684173,4,6303544428,"Lucy Marsden (Diane Lane/Anne Bancroft) was the child-bride of an aging former boy-soldier of the Confederacy (""Captain"" Marsden - Donald Sutherland.)  Because of the relative youth of these two at their defining moment, the confluence results in Lucy, through sheer attrition, becoming the Oldest Living Confederate Widow.
Allan Gurganus's epic book is one of my all-time favorites.  I only recently discovered that a movie had been made of it.  By the transitional scene cuts, I'm guessing that this was a ""made-for TV"" mini-series?  As is usually the case, the book is much better than the movie. Even at epic length, (180 minutes) the movie cuts out major panoramic threads of the book: Castalia (Cicely Tyson) and her family, the workers at Lucy's Nursing Home, the adult lives of Captain & Lucy's children. It does not have the lush, vivid technicolours of Gone With the Wind.  Still and yet it is a good movie - spanning as it does two centuries of US History: racial, gender, and ageist  prejudice are exposed in a sometimes poignant, sometimes humorous fashion.  Well worth purchasing for repeat viewing.",1027296000,10,1113,5.049180327868853

A few recent purchases (NOT by this seller) have been a disappointment because sound quality was awful so much so, that I had to turn volume UP to the max and still difficult to hear. Might as well toss them in the trash.

Thanks to this seller my experience was perfect. Purchase was easy, arrival was on time and this Movie is just as I remember it to be years and years ago when it ran on TV.

I love Cicely Tyson and Diane Lane. This movie is comforting to me and like visiting an old friend.  When I have a rough day and know I have the time I pop in this DVD.  I read the book and it is a favorite of mine as well. A beautiful movie with fantastic performances. I think Diane Lane should have won the Emmy along with Cicely Tyson. Brilliant performances by all. Strong story brings a human side to history. It touched me deeply and continues to. Beautiful and complex and taught me so much.

Blythe Danner did a wonderful job in her role. Donald Sutherland is always good.

684829,5,6303544428,"Originally, I had bought this movie because my favorite actor, Donald Sutherland, played a major part in it. But the best that can be said in this case is that he was truly excellent in a rather unsympathetic role. Not only did Captain Marsden suffer from serious PTSD but, perhaps like many men of his time and culture, he was also thoughtless and sometimes downright boorish (that wedding-night scene was a bit of a shock). Still, Sutherland did a great job of showing us a man who was at times charming, but most of all, deeply broken.

That being said, the real surprise for me was the excellent quality of this TV movie, its flow and the general feeling of warmth that permeated it. It was truly uplifting to watch the evolution of the central character, Lucy, over some eight decades, as well as her friendship with the former slave Castalia. Even poor Captain Marsden was depicted with understanding. It was also great to see the way Lucy approached old age with such spunk and zest for life in spite (perhaps because) of all that she had been through. The two female leads were outstanding, and I can't fathom how I had never heard of this movie before!

I admit that it took me a few viewings to (almost) fully understand all the dialogue, because of some heavy Southern accents as well as some unusual turns of language. But in the end, that same writing style turned out to be one of the more delightful aspects of the movie.

And, as an added bonus, the soundtrack includes some lovely melodies that stay with you long after the movie is over.

What more can I say? It was a great surprise and I highly recommend it!

P.S. I just read the book and my advice is: if you like the movie, stick with that! The book is INCREDIBLY long-winded (this from someone who has read many long books), but you won't learn all that much more of interest about the main characters. Plus some passages are needlessly crude, especially the Captain's death scene, which I found revolting. (Thank goodness they toned it down in the movie.) Since this is not a true story, making his death so disgusting just strikes me as unnecessarily mean, sort of like kicking someone who's already been down for a long time.
So my advice to you would be to save your money... and your eyes!!",1346630400,,2269,4.524390243902439

684899,5,6303544428,"I saw this movie years ago, when it first appeared as a TV movie.  It amazed me then, and it amazes me now.  There are so many great parts in this movie, so many poignant moments.  And what a cast -- Diane Lane as Lucy Marsden and Donald Sutherland as ""Captain"" Willie Marsden, who she calls only ""Cap'n.""

The story is told through flashbacks as an elderly Lucy reflects upon  her life as she now lives at a retirement facility.  She remembers back to her childhood, starting with the year 1899 when she was 15 years old.  A school assignment takes her to the Marsden home, where she is to interview Mrs. Marsden (Willie's mother) about Civil War life.  During this visit, she runs into the family's maid, Castalia (Cicely Tyson) a freed slave who chose to remain with the family as a servant, and a 50-year-old Captain Marsden, who's been a good friend to Lucy's family.  Captain Marsden courts Lucy (who's always been more of a tomboy than a young Southern lady, to her mother's constant frustration) and proposes to her.  As is the way during that time, age isn't a factor and her parents approve the match.

Sutherland does an excellent job as William Marsden, a man who has never forgotten just what the Civil War has cost him ... and how it's changed him.  He was a young soldier at 13, given a uniform in the South's desperation to get as many men onto the field as possible.  At 13, he watched men die around him, endured terror in a field hospital, and lost his best friend,Ned, another young boy, in battle.  He carries the Civil War with him daily.

One thing I like about this movie is the chemistry between Lane and Sutherland.  It is easy to see that Lucy and Captain Marsden DO love each other and have a mostly happy marriage, with a house full of children ... the boys named by Cap'n Marsden after comrades he'd known and lost during various battles.  Both are stubborn people, and they have many battles of will ... but they do love each other.  The Captain relies upon his wife to help him forget the war, and Lucy tries ... but as PTSD wasn't diagnosed back then, she is powerless.  After a hunting accident injurs her oldest child and yellow fever claims her youngest, Lucy struggles to maintain her own equilibrium.  At one point, she leaves her home but encounters a childhood friend (who actually betrayed her back then) who lost her family by running away ... and finally returns home with a new sense of where she belongs.

This is a great drama with fascinating insight about just what those boys who returned home from the nation's most bloody war may have felt ... the demons that chased them into their adult lives, and how those demons affected their own families.  It also shows how strong Lucy was for putting up with those demons he brought in, and enduring her own.",1234828800,13,2801,4.5049504950495045
684900,3,6303544428,"First of all, the oldest living confederate widow married a civil war vet 40 years after the war, so her story really has little to do with the war and the south during the war, which is why I wanted to watch this movie in the first place.  Second, this widow married a 50 year old at 14 years old, which means you have to watch a child get wedlock-raped while benign music plays in the background for half of the movie.  Stranger still is when she supposedly falls in love with the old sheep.

You see a number of other events in her life, the death of an infant, the blinding of her son, intermixed with clips of her life as an old person.  It's interesting and funny at times, and is well-acted.  It ends with an ode to parenthood, which I found pretty dull.  That's all a 100 year old woman could come up with?  It's ok, but if you're looking for something inspiring or historically rich, look elsewhere.",1232582400,18,908,4.2748538011695905

684971,5,6303544428,"Normally, it is the other way around.  If you have read the book most people tend to pick a movie apart.  In this case it is the reverse - the movie is vastly superior.  Donald Sotherland is outstanding as the Captain and Diane Lane is wonderful as his long suffering wife.  The book is much harder to get through as it skips around in time and is written as if by a rather uneducated woman from the south in the early 1900's.  That said, I would highly recommend the movie, but probably not the book.",1202428800,2,501,4.231578947368421

684975,5,6303544428,"Those are among the first lines we hear from Cicely Tyson in this wonderful movie.

I freely admit that I'm a sap for old movies and old things and old times. And perhaps that's why I love this movie so much. It opens at the beginning of the 20th Century, the early 1900s. As someone who's written a couple architecture books about this period of time, I'm happy to say that the historical aspects of the movie all looked good, so I was able to just relax and enjoy the flick.

We all think that the early 1900s were a simpler time and place but this movie presents a more honest view of history, particularly as it relates to women's issues. One of the minor plot lines presents the story of a woman who has lost her children forever because she sought a divorce. Another poignant scene is where Lucy (lead character) gives up on life after a tragedy in the family.

Laying in bed, she chews on crayons and tells her husband (Donald Southerland) that she's only ""fuzz on a pillow."" (BTW, crayons in those days contained lead, giving them a taste not unlike sweet tarts and said to be highly addictive. That's what I loved about this movie; it got the details right.)

I've watched this movie about 20 times and even though I've memorized many of the lines, I still cry and laugh and feel touched, stirred and inspired. I love the acting, the setting, the story, the beauty, the love affair between the old ""Cap'n"" and his beautiful young wife. It's believable, endearing and captivating.

The acting is first rate, too. I recommend this movie 100%.

I cried through parts as it was so unfair for such a cultured girl to be caught in the web of an old liar, who was no hero in the war but a young thirteen-year-old who survived his best friend and felt guilty for the boy's death.  He lured the heart-broken teenager into his web of deceit when she was most vulnerable.  Like me, she wanted out before it began but, unlike me, she endured and suffered more as a consequence.

We make some bad choices in our lives and must sleep in the bed which we made.  It is never easy to declare defeat but, in her day, it was an impossibility.  It was a miracle she survived so much and lived all those years with her guilt.  Something similar happened in my family, but he lasted only a couple of years because of cancer.  It was kept from me, like most of the things we really need to know.  I have been to very few funerals, because someone else makes the decision not to let me know.

This lady survived all of her children, and when the celebration for her honor approaches, almost the same as her husband was given, she relives his war terror and hardships and their combative, but loving family life through flashbacks.  This is where I cried, and I guess my eyes will still be red tomorrow.

Diane Lane was marvelous as the young wife and Anne Bancroft spectacular as the celebrant who was confined to a wheel chair and living in a nursing home.  It's tragic what age does to us, even when we are still the young person inside.  She was intelligent enough to make friends with a pessimistic physics professor and they learned a thing or two from each other.

It was fantastic to watch Cicely Tyson age as the family servant no one could live without, and the acting ability it took to change so much.  Her character was one of the best, even though it is hard to understand.

I loved the war scenes with the Confederate flag. A few months ago, I was invited to join the Daughters of the Confederacy but declined as I figured I was the only rebel in my family.  Actually, I was not ready to look too closely into my father's side of the family.  Living in Sevier County during that time, I doubt that they were on the side I favor, and it might hurt more to know that than to pay so much to be an associate member.  To me, at this time, I have better things to do with my money and time.  Maybe I'll go on a cruise.",1121212800,14,2598,4.185110663983903

7850735,3,6303544428,"As a Southerner I could understand maybe 40% of the dialogue of heavy simulated Southern accents.

The main character is an ignorant clueless stubborn self-indulgent child who refuses to grow up both to her discredit & credit.

She marries a much older Civil War veteran who seems perpetually the 13 years old boy who blithely went off to fight in the Civil War

She is 26 when her eldest child, Ned, 11.  That agrees with book which said she was 15 and he was 50 when they married.

The rock of the movie is the female former slave who takes care of emotionally stunted Civil War veteran and his child wife.

5 of the 6 children survive to adulthood, but only 3 come to their fathers funeral in 1945.  The whereabouts of the missing two boys is not explained.

If there had been English subtitles, I might have given this TV movie 4 stars",1511827200,,839,4.402597402597403
