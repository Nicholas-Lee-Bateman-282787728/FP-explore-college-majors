8539140,5,B009B82DJ8,"It might be because I owe so much of love for the UFC, and MMA in general, to the original Ultimate Fighter season but this DVD set was a wonderful trip back over memory lane as well as a pretty fun documentary.  Now, if you go into this documentary expecting the same kind of production that was involved in Chuck Liddell's documentary, ""Ultimate Iceman"", you'll probably be disappointed.  It's not that the production level is low or bad but the difference is the personality of Griffin.  If you're buying this set, or at least interested in checking, it out then I'm going to assume you're a fan of Griffin.  You know that his sense of humor is almost every part of the charm that probably led you to be a fan of his in the first place.  The only problem may be is that it seems to be such a dominating aspect of his personality that he has a hard time getting away from the self-deprecating guy that we know him to be, even though this is a documentary that's focused on him.  Although I say that the documentary is mostly filled with Griffin being silly and sarcastic I think what makes this documentary actually shine are the scenes where Griffin gets serious.  There are moments in the documentary where he actually talks about his experiences in an honest manner that seems pretty unusual.

The documentary is pretty short.  It runs little over an hour and does what a documentary does, which is highlighting all of the important parts in the fighter's career and life.  It was interesting getting a look at the things Griffin does outside of the fight game, especially given that in recent years he hasn't been fighting as much.  What was pretty fun was getting insight from some of his fellow trainers and family which isn't always the kind of insight that we're used to outside of the ""Countdown"" shows.  Unfortunately for me, I would have loved to have gotten some words of thought from other fighters, especially those he has gone toe-to-toe with (although we do hear quite a bit from Stephan Bonnar).  Although realistically there aren't many fighters who I imagine have a good time talking about fights they have lost, let alone sharing those moments on film during another person's documentary.  But again, this is just a personal preference of my own.

Now, the other reason most of my friends are fans of Griffin is due to his fighting style.  He used to brawl, ala the TUF season 1 finale, before becoming a more refined and technical version of the man we know now.  Although old habits die hard.  He typically takes a good crack or two before he gets into the mentality of a serious fight.  Luckily for fans, Griffin is at a point where most of his fights are against high enough ranking fighters that this is the case.  The second disc in this two disc collector's set is filled to the brim with the best of classic Griffin fights.  This is the full listing:

The Ultimate Fighter Season 1 Finale: Griffin vs. Bonnar
UFC 53: Griffin vs. Bill Manhood
UFC 55: Griffin vs. Elvis Sinosic
UFC 59: Griffin vs. Tito Ortiz I
UFC 76: Griffin vs. ""Shogun"" Rua
UFC 86: Griffin vs. ""Rampage"" Jackson
UFC 106: Griffin vs. Tito Ortiz II
UFC 148: Griffin vs. Tito Ortiz III

From the all time classic of the first TUF finale, to his UFC debut, to his championship title fight, and all the way until the finishing bout in his famous trilogy with Tito Ortiz, this set has each fight in its entirety.  I love the fact that many of these fights are what made UFC the kind of business that it is today.  Most of these fights are wars between some of the biggest names in the business and it takes older fans such as myself down one hell of a memory lane drive.  Personally, I think they made the right choices with these fights but given the kind of MMA fan I am this is all subjective.

In the end, I would highly recommend this set.  As of right now the set is just around 10 dollars and if not for the documentary then this set is worth it for the fights.  Beyond that there are some interesting and humorous extras that go along with the first disc although I cannot say they are the real prize on this set.  So, take it as you will but most die hard fans are going to get this regardless of what I say but to newer fans I would say this set works as a good reminder why most people are fans of Griffin.",1357603200,6,4309,4.410872313527181
