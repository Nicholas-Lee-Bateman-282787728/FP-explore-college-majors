I thought the DVD would help to reinforce the stories by animating them, but no. It's just a voice reading (verrry slowwwly) the tales from the workbook as the drawings appear on the screen. The slowwww voice is maddening to both of us! Then come the quizzes. A DVD of quizzes, whee. I wish I hadn't spend the extra money on the DVD. The workbook alone is plenty.",1349222400,85,493,4.613636363636363
173996,5,0976202468,"I was hesitant in buying this as I really have become skeptical about these so called multiplication memorization programs.

I would not have believed it, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.  When the first part of the dvd was over my daughter knew the start of the time tables! Whenever I shoot out a problem she answers it without hesitation!

I am thrilled with this product, because it really does work and my daughter enjoyed learning from it which is the biggest plus of all!",1331856000,,483,4.465909090909091
173997,5,0976202468,"I homeschool and one of my children is Dyslexic. We hit a rough patch in learning the multiplication facts so in desperation, I looked for something to help assist him. Enter Times Tales.
I can confidently say that Times Tales has done wonders for my son with its stories that help the Dyslexic, right-brain learner ""memorize"" multiplication facts. He finally grasps them in a way that is unique and fun to him.  No more tears, no more frustration. :0)",1330387200,4,452,4.7215189873417724
173998,5,0976202468,"I had seen Times Tales advertised for some time, but wasn't sure if I wanted to invest in it. I AM SO GLAD I DID!

My daughter is 9 and my son 7.  Though this was intended for my daughter, my son jumped in also. We spent 45min-1hr each day for 4 days just watching the video and reviewing. At the end of 4 days she had the times tables memorized. No tears, no frustration. They enjoyed it! The next week we reviewed the stories once or twice, but mainly they practiced the video flash cards on their own.

Times Tales gives each number a character then tells a short two sentence story about how those characters interact which translates into the math problem. For instance, 4= chair, 8=Ms. Snowman; Ms. Snowman stands on the chair to reach 3 buttons and 2 mittens; translates:8x4=32.

The video goes step by step, first introducing each character and letting the child review them. Then it tells the stories and reviews them; then it shows how they translate into math problems. There are stages of flash cards where at first it shows the number-character then just the number.  There are also timed reviews. It is divided into two parts dividing the math facts to make memorizing the stories more manageable.

It would be easy to spend less time each day and take a bit longer (though not much) to memorize the times tables....for instance, just learn the characters one day, the stories the next, introduce the math problems the next, then spend a few days practicing before doing the same in part 2.  Since my children were already familiar with multiplication and we had been practicing for some time, I pushed a little harder and they did great. (Granted, I don't expect a 7 year old to know multiplication, he just followed his interest in this case.)

I also would not use Times Tales to TEACH multiplication, just the memorization. The concept that 4x8 means 4 groups of 8 needs to be understood and mastered. (Making up skip-counting songs and lots of hands on games can be played to teach this concept. Here's one we played: roll two dice; the first one is the number of circles we drew on our paper, the second was the number of stars we drew in each circle. Figure out the answer by skip-counting to each group or if needed, counting each individual star.) Anyway, while children who do not understand the concept to multiplication can easily memorize the tables using this video, it is still important that they also understand the concept of multiplication.  I LOVE TIMES TALES FOR MAKING THE MEMORIZATION EASY!!

A side note, Times Tales does not cover 0s,1s, 2a, or 5s.  They realize most easily memorize these and focus on the harder problems. We are making up our own character for 5 and our own stories. Also, I highly recommend the DVD vs. the book version. It is simple, easy to follow.  After the first couple of times watching, I could put in the DVD and tell them to review the stories or just practice the timed flashcards.  I wanted to watch it at first so that I would know the stories, but it was so worth the little bit extra for them to independently study.  There is also a computer disc that comes with the DVD that has printables if you care to use them. (They do not have printables of each story page; my only disappointment.) Hope you enjoy this resource as much as we did!",1328227200,52,3311,4.542857142857143
173999,5,0976202468,"I bought this because my 4th grader has had a very difficult time learning his times tables. Flash cards drills just don't stick it in his brain. We are in the process of getting him tested for dyslexia but in the mean time this dvd has helped him immensely.

The whole dvd gives the feeling it is for a young child though so you must prepare your older child for it. The tone and intonation of the narrator's voice is straight off of a pre-school show. My son is pretty sensitive to things that he feels are too ""babyish"" so we just tried to have fun with it. However, it might just be the voice that helps children learn the stories quickly. The drawings are very basic but they are fine.

The video is broken up into two parts so it's not too much to remember at once. And each part has several steps so the transition from learning a story to translating it to a multiplication problem is very easy. After two viewing sessions, one for Part 1 and one for Part 2, my son now knows all of the upper times tables that are covered in this program. He was so proud of himself. Most importantly, it boosted his confidence. Even though he's an intelligent, articulate child, he felt like he was stupid because he was having such a difficult time with these math facts. Now he is seeing that he can remember them--it just took a different learning style to do it.",1327536000,5,1359,4.325490196078431
174000,4,0976202468,"My third grader is learning her times table via this video.  The stories are memorable (if hokey) and she seems to enjoy watching the video. It has been quite effective, and we are glad that we made the purchase. (We also use the free website [...] to reinforce the facts and to increase the speed of her recall.)

The only negatives are these: (1) the voice on the video speaks as if she were speaking to preschoolers; since this is a ""learn your times table"" video, it seems that a more mature approach could have been used; and (2) while my daughter has learned the stories, the recall process is not immediate; she has to remember the story and tell it to herself before she knows the answer -- a process that takes about 5 seconds.  The third comment is not a negative so much as a comment about what could have been accomplished via the video; not all of the multiplication facts are covered.  I would have preferred a more complete treatment.",1324339200,12,949,4.468208092485549
174001,5,0976202468,"My son was still struggling to memorize his multiplication tables as he started 5th grade. He has a language disorder that affects organization of thought, so keeping all of the tables straight in his memory is more difficult for him. We tried several different techniques in our homeschooling to help him, but none with much success. We gave Times Tales a try and it has been a tremendous help to him. He did object to the stories at first, saying they were dumb and babyish. But I made him give the dvd a chance to work and it did! However, don't expect it to be an instant miracle for a child with learning issues. We followed the program as exactly described by the makers, breaking the video down into segments and staying on one section until he learned it. Even after completing the dvd, due to my son's language delay, I regularly print out the worksheets (included in the cd) to keep reenforcing the stories for both multiplication and division. I do this on Mondays especially to ""warm up"" his brain for math and this pattern of interval reinforcement is working well for him.

I had my younger son (3rd grade with no learning issues) do Times Tales with us and it was a success with him also. Since he is younger, he didn't object to childishness of the stories. Like others have mentioned, he knows his upper multiplication better than the easier ones now. So this program works well for those without learning disabilities too. It changed learning multiplication from some boring rote memorization chore to a fun, painless experience. I'm thankful to Times Tales to making this video and recommend it all of my homeschooling friends.",1323648000,37,1646,4.715277777777778

my son really struggles with rote memory. It's taken me 6 months just to teach him his addition facts and that's just for the doubles! He has a disability that basically makes it very difficult for him to remember people's names and anything that does just straight-up rote memorization. I came across these times Tales in a Homeschool Group forum and decided to give it a try. My son now knows all the multiplication facts they cover and it's only been under 6 weeks! Truly mind-blowing for us. I seriously get so teary-eyed watching him fill in the answers and to see the pride on his face. For a kid like mine you just have no idea how much he struggles and I am so so thankful that we found this program. I'll be honest at first I thought how hokey but once I started to realize it was sinking in and he was remembering it my skepticism turned to excitement! The program relies on experiential memory using stories and then Association memory. Anyway just had to share what a blessing this was to us! This seriously was life changing for us because now I'm trying to adapt to all of his learning and curriculum into this model.",1515456000,,1350,4.487804878048781

174011,5,0976202468,"My son is 11 y/o.  I homeschool him now, after realizing that public school was not meeting his learning disabilities.  He has dyscalculia, and this first semester we are focusing on just getting him caught up to appropriate grade level.  With testing, I found that he was functioning at 3rd grade level math.  Different approaches were not working well, with he and I becoming frustrated.  I've discovered he is definitely a right-brain learner, so imaging is huge when learning math.  Most repetitious approaches in learning math basics is linear, and geared toward the left-brain learner.

Times Tales arrived in our mailbox at 1PM; by 3:30PM, the same day, my son had mastered the first half of this DVD; was asking if he could repeat it again, on the same evening; and asked the following morning when he was going to be performing it again that day for review.  My cheeks were sore from smiling so much, and my heart was swelling with such immense pride.  He has been walking on Cloud 9 for these past 3 days - and his overall attitude to schoolwork is changing. Kiddos with dyscalculia become so frustrated, as they see others slide through math so effortlessly.  They tend to become very ""beaten up,"" and resentful to the learning process, when their brain does not process correctly.  Thank you, Times Tales!!!  :)",1509926400,5,1323,4.8053097345132745

This is the most amazing teaching tool.  I would highly reccomend it for kids who are struggling with learning multiplication facts when traditional methods haven't helped!!

A couple of words of warning, however, the production level/quality of graphics on the DVD is pretty low, but who cares?!?  It also may seem a little babyish to your kid at first, but if s/he is motivated to learn and frustrated with old methods, just encourage them to stick it out to the end and watch it with them!",1500854400,,973,4.755952380952381

174033,5,0976202468,"We have been using the DVD and stories for about 3 months and it has worked great to help my 10 year old dyslexic daughter remember her math facts. It seems counter-intuitive, but remembering the stories is much easier for her than remembering random facts. Now that she's doing multi-digit multiplication, all I have to do is occasionally remind her of the characters - ""what's the story with Mrs. Week and the 6th Grade Class?"" - and she takes it from there. Although the program is good, it still takes repetition. And making the jump from the stories to realizing that the stories are literally giving them the answer involved a bit of explanation - my daughter found it confusing at first.  This is not going to teach them what multiplication is - it is only a memory device that works for some kids with learning differences. The Times Tales website has a trial if you want to see if it will work for your child before you purchase.

We started just by going over the stories every day for a few days. Then we did the stories and the recall. Then we added the quizzes. It took us 5 - 7 sessions to get through each level and we still review the stories occasionally (without the quizzes). I've also used the printables that you can purchase from their website to create a reminder sheet she can use at school when I'm not there to help her remember the characters since her teacher isn't familiar with the stories.

Overall, the program has worked great for us and has helped my daughter to understand that she doesn't have a learning disability - just a learning difference.",1488153600,,1581,4.540350877192982

They are perfectly illustrated to match the characters on the show, and use the same method to help your child recall facts quickly. I think with a few more views my son will have greatly boosted his math facts. The Times Tales DVD provides a unique, fun, interactive approach to math facts mastery.

Yeah, the pictures are a little cheese, but for 2 boys who are visual this video is a God send! I started with part 1 and took a week going over that and using the worksheets that come with it. They remembered these so quickly!  Then I spent another week doing part 2 and this works! Both of them now remember their times tables! It only does the more ""difficult"" facts that don't have tricks to go with them. Like 1 times any number is that number. For 2 you would double the number and so on.

174054,5,0976202468,"This DVD is specifically designed to help children memorize the times tables. It will not help with understanding how to multiply - just memorize. It uses mental visualization techniques that are very effective for many children. My son is doing fantastically well memorizing these.

How does it work? You learn how various numbers are characters like butterflies or a tree house. Then there's a cute story and it will help the child memorize the multiplication fact.

Is it fun? Not really - but is it super boring? No! In particular if the kids get into the game show format and the adult helping the children stays with them throughout. You kind of have to help it along, encourage the child and make use of the pdf files in CD from that come with the DVD. I have a Mac and had no trouble opening and printing the files. I think they need to update a bit and give buyers a choice to get the files online as my Mac is old and my newest computer is a Chromebook with no DVD slot. I see amazon has various options and I am not sure which version exactly I have: it came with a DVD and a CD. So maybe they already offer the files version. Just be mindful if you don't have a computer with a CD/DVD reader to find a different version if you want to use the flash cards and other goodies.",1456704000,5,1285,4.283950617283951

174058,3,0976202468,"My son, age 9,  is having fun with this and I think is mostly getting it. I have had to clarify some things about the stories before he masters them. The stories are inconsistent with the results. Sometimes the result is a complete 2 digit whole number, sometimes they are individual digits which will make up the 2 digit whole number answer and then you are left to figure out how to put them together. Sometimes the results include the characters of the story and sometimes they do not. It's very confusing. My younger daughter, age 6, has watched along too, but flips the answers at the end of the story, thus making it a wrong answer. She doesn't quite grasp the concept of multiplying yet and so argues with me that it does not matter how you tell the story, when in fact it matters very much how you memorize and tell the story exactly. I was fortunate to find the DVD on sale. I wasn't aware of a notebook/workbook available. I'd recommend that because you can read the stories to your kids rather than watch the DVD which is slower to get through. I think it's a nice tool to have in your kit for helping to memorize times table facts, but definitely should not be the only tool. It requires parents to guide them through.

174073,3,0976202468,"I am starting with the ugly on this review.  I viewed a free sample of this on the website of Times Tales.  I decided to purchase here on Amazon because I wanted an actual DVD and I didn't want to wait forever for media mail.  I believe this was a mistake.  The sample I saw was a colorful version.  This DVD was just a picture of black and white pages and primitive animation.  Also, they changed the name of one of the characters between this DVD and the sample I saw.  The newer name is better so that is what we called it when viewing this DVD.  All of that made me very disappointed and wishing I had opted for the digital download.

Now for the bad news.  My son found this incredibly boring and did not want to watch it. He really didn't like the sample either. We had him watch it anyway.

The good news.  Despite my son's insistence that he ""just remembered"" the facts, as a homeschooling mom, I know different.  HE LEARNED HIS FACTS!!!!  My son has visual processing issues and we have struggled through memorization of facts.  This was the key that he needed to really know them.  This is why even though he didn't like the sample, we spent the money on the DVD.  He has learned and knows his facts quickly.

It is really obnoxious that we have to fast forward (no scene skipping, even) through the entirety of what we've already done.

For example, Ms. Weeks (7) and Ms. Snowman (8) were driving in a car. They were driving 1 mile over the speed limit (7x8=56).  Or Ms. Snowman (8) stood on a chair (4) to grab 3 buttons and 2 mittens (8x4=32).

The stories were visual and clicked for my child. He still remembers those stores (apparently I do too) and can visualize the answers quickly.

My three year old is not particularly advanced and has actually struggled with some developmental delays, so this was really impressive!
 These DVDs are not overly animated and entertaining. The were just entertaining enough to keep my child's attention. Honestly, it was a little work to get her to stay and watch it, but once she figured out that she knew her multiplication facts, she was all over continuing to practice it! Her face lit up and she was so proud of herself! I wish these DVDs were around when I was a child because memorizing multiplication facts was a complete nightmare for me.

174088,5,0976202468,"My younger kids watched these videos to help supplement their learning of their times tables.  Having not taught them yet any multiplication, they watched the video and within I'd say 30 sec to 1 min of processing, trying to recall the story, they could say what 7 x 4 was, or 8 x 3, or 9 x 4, etc. when they had never known it before.  After having practiced recalling the story a few times with just the numbers (no character drawings of the numbers), they could even more quickly recall the answer.  They were so excited in their new found ability after only an hour of fun story watching!

The way it works is, the video teaches the kids to remember each number as a character in the story.  In Part One, the 9 is a tree, the 8 is Mr. Snowman, the 7 is Mrs. Week, the 6 is the first grade class, the 3 is a butterfly, the 4 is a chair.  Then they use the characters to describe and show them through art work, a situation the characters are involved in.  For instance, ""Mrs. Week (7) sits on a chair (4) and fishes.  She catches 2 boots, followed by 8 trout"".  It then instructs the kids to repeat the story in the exact order and has them practice along with the video.  Once the kids can recall the story, they show them flashcards with the drawings of Mrs. Week (7) x the chair (4) = 2(boots) 8(trout) and has them retell the story.  Finally, it just shows them 7 x 4 = 28.  My girls were like ""Hey...! This is easy!""

Granted, I still believe it does not replace the traditional method of teaching multiplication by instructing them in the ""why"" of multiplication, but it really is a fun, interactive video that holds their attention and really helps cement in place the times tables.  It was amazing to see my 5 year old spouting multiplication facts without having to grill her in the typical flashcard style.

It is great that the characters stay the same and there is a gradual release from the pictures to the numbers.  A definite strength is the easy link to division.  Visual learners will LOVE this.

After watching this DVD daily for the last few days, he has managed to remember the stories, thus allowing him to get the correct answer-not always, but most of the time.  Even my 7th grade daughter is fighting with him to yell out the answers.  I am determined to have my son learn his multiplication by the time the new school year starts in August.  This DVD is AWE.SOME!! I also purchased the Disney DVD- DONALD IN MATHMAGIC LAND at the same time.  It had great reviews but have yet to watch it.",1370390400,,672,4.379032258064516
174102,5,0976202468,"I don't usually get around to writing reviews. I usually just get busy and forget. This dvd and book set, however, is different and worth taking the time to write a review. I homeschool my 9 yr old son who has PDD-NOS, an autism spectrum disorder. The reason I homeschool is because in public school he was falling more and more behind despite special ed classes and programs. We tried private school and he could not keep up there either. Both environments included bullying. When we got started at home about a year ago he knew no math facts at all despite having tried several different methods and many hours of flash cards, music cd's etc.... I found an addition/subtraction method/book on Amazon that worked wonderfully(2 plus 2 is not 5) and we moved right on to this. I was not sure about it, but to make it short, in less than a week, my son is popping out mult fact answers like crazy! To say it's been nearly effortless is an understatement.  In the past my son has learned best one on one (couldn't learn in classroom setting) with constant repetition. I am so thankful for this program! I can't begin to explain how much time and energy it has saved because it is like they learn it without realizing it. They learn some cute stories tied to pictures and then they just know the answers. I hope this is helpful for someone trying to decide whether it will work for them or not. :)",1366156800,10,1393,4.44140625
174103,5,0976202468,"I am so grateful for this system.  We had done flashcards, drills, games, practice sheets etc and NOTHING was making math facts stick for my kids.  It was gluing buttons on ice cream - they just wouldn't stay put in their heads.  But this changed everything.  In a little over a week, both my 7 yr old and my 9 yr old had completely mastered these facts backwards and forwards with Times Tales, and they loved doing it!  They even asked to put the DVD on before breakfast in the mornings!  Now, if only there was an Addition Adventures, too!",1364428800,4,541,4.36
174104,5,0976202468,"The first thing our son said after he heard the first story problem was, ""Mommy!  Whoever came up with this idea is a genius!""  He had all mulitplications memorized in two sittings.  We was thrilled for him and his confidence soared when we drilled multiplications with him!  Fabulous product and it works!",1363996800,,306,4.826923076923077
174105,5,0976202468,I would recommend to anyone who's child is having trouble remembering their times tables. The stories are easy to remember and the kids have fun while learning.,1361577600,,160,4.962962962962963
174106,5,0976202468,My daughter who struggles with math did so well using this DVD. The stories that go along with the math facts are memorable and really helped my daughter to learn her facts with ease.,1360022400,,183,4.411764705882353
174107,5,0976202468,"I purchased this as a last ditch effort to finally get my kids to memorize multiplication.  It worked amazingly well.  The only trouble I had was forcing my kids to watch it because it seemed so ""babyish"".  I think the earlier you start with this video, the better.  Personally, I don't think there would be a child too young for this video.  I wish I had found it earlier for my kids, but even now, it still did the trick.",1358553600,,423,4.2375
174108,5,0976202468,"If we had only know about this back in 3rd grade!  Our son has trouble memorizing anything out of a context.  Although he fought it at first, but as soon as he realized that he was finally remembering his facts, he was all in!",1352764800,,226,4.113636363636363
174109,5,0976202468,"I'm a homeschooler to five wonderful but VERY different from one another kids.  My third grader needed to learn his times tables.  My fifth grader knew them, but not quickly enough.  I got physically sick at the idea of doing flash cards AGAIN!  'There has GOT to be a good mnemonic way to do this,' thought I.  So I did a search and found Times Tales.  I ordered the DVD set (that is all you need - not any books...the DVD set contains the lessons and worksheets for review - just everything I needed).  All of my kids (including a 1st grader, a Ker and a 4 year old) religiously watched the DVD on the 3s and 4s for 5 days in a row.  We did the exercises a few times afterwards - all three of my eldest (yes, including the 1st grader) had them down flat.  So then we moved on to the 6s, 7s, 8s and 9s.  It was even faster.  No problems...only giggles and fun - imitations of Mrs. Snowman knocking on the treehouse door, ""Hello, is anyone in there?!?!"" - very cute.  My littlest ones even know a lot of the facts and I didn't even TRY to have them watch - they just always did because they enjoyed the stories so much.  So then my 3rd grader and I moved on in our lessons to long division, etc. and he's flying through.  My 5th grader, no longer stuck taking forever to get his math done.  Math is now a pleasure, thanks to Times Tales.  Just get it, spend the money and save yourself the flash card headache....it's a bit monotonous if you watch it with your kids everytime, but you can internally analyze the stories - how horrible Mrs. Week's boundaries are or how hard it really must be to function daily as a snowman and it CAN be interesting for you too!:)",1352592000,73,1663,4.182389937106918
174110,5,0976202468,Times Tales was like a miracle for my child!  My child struggles to learn math facts. This is the only way we were able to learn them. If you are unsure of whether or not to purchase it check out the sample video on you tube.  You will be amazed at how effortlessly this system works to get those facts into long term memory.,1351036800,,325,4.0625
174111,5,0976202468,"My 8 year old daughter was having trouble memorizing her times tables. We were moving on to long division (she's homeschooled), but began having trouble with division because she didn't have her times tables memorized (she knew the concept of how to do it, but didn't know them by heart). I ordered this DVD and within a week, she could rattle them off whenever I asked. This video is amazing!!!",1349827200,,395,4.6571428571428575
7794670,5,0976202468,"I remember learning multiplication facts as a child and it was boring, never ending repetition. Now it was my poor child's turn and she was struggling. She has ADHD which made it even worse for her. We tried everything, writing the facts over and over, apps, printables, nothing seemed to stick. On my quest to find another printable, or maybe some magic trick to help her remember her multiplication facts I found these DVDs that were highly recommended. I cringed at the price point but decided I'd give it a try. It is absolutely worth it. I watched the DVD with my daughter, we watched the stories twice because she wasn't sure she remembered everything correctly after the first time. And now she got it. Her face when she realized that she learned the (first half) of the upper times table within about 40 minutes was priceless! She can't wait to watch the second half.
I am so grateful for these DVDs and would recommend them to anyone whose child doesn't do well with mind numbing memorizing math equations.",1525651200,,1015,4.675977653631285

7794672,4,0976202468,"Can't say enough good things about these videos. this is actually the second time we bought it for my second child. The first one was used by my oldest and became scratched over time. The videos are pretty cheap looking computerization but it doesn't matter the kids learn the stories easy and that's what is for after all.
I do wish the price wasn't so high, seems a bit much for a DVD otherwise I would give five stars",1524268800,,420,4.329113924050633
7794673,5,0976202468,This video is magic!!!!!!!!!  My nine year old is not a numbers person and could not memorize math facts to save his life. He had all of the facts in this video memorized after watching it once. Seriously magic.,1522281600,,211,4.410256410256411

7794676,5,0976202468,"WORKS!  I used this for my son when he was on 2nd grade and after watching it every day for a week he had them down.  After that we practiced on worksheets, but he knew them.  He has adhd an HFA fwiw.

My daughter is now in 2nd grade and I'm planning to work on this over her spring break next week.  Can't wait for her to have them down.",1520380800,,338,3.7714285714285714
7794677,5,0976202468,"We just bought this for our children ages 5 and 3 because we had heard such great reviews, so I thought why not? I don't want to spend hours and hours teaching times tables if a DVD can handle the monotony for me. I was disappointed to learn that this was for the upper times tables when my kids have barely touched times tables to begin with and certainly not the upper level tables. Guess I should have actually read the details before purchase. However, we had the DVD and the kids wanted to watch so we played it for them. My 5 year old son came in on part 2 (the more difficult times tables) and kept commenting ""That was fun!"" to each story. At the end of that 30 minute segment the DVD began going through the flashcards to which he commented, ""I don't want to watch this part; we already know it!"" I replied that he didn't and needed to pay attention, ""What's 7x7?"" I ask. He got it wrong. Point proven right? Then the next flashcard comes up ""8x8="" Suddenly he bursts out, ""64!"" Ok, guess they learned more than I thought... this isn't to say that once through gave them perfect knowledge of the times tables, but the ability to hit 1 or 2 out of 3 after 30 minutes was still impressive to me.

So the reason I am writing this review now is because as soon as the DVD finished I rushed off to Amazon looking for any other DVD's in a series to purchase and found nothing. Bummer. To the authors, please make more of these videos for addition/subtraction, etc. I will buy them all!",1518912000,,1488,4.257950530035336

Highly recommend for audio/visual learners!",1516838400,,140,4.875
7794679,5,0976202468,"After reading all the reviews I decided to try this for my middle school daughter who has dyscalculia as well.  Please realize that this is a severe math learning disability and not just someone who doesn't know times tables.  This is a disorder where math sense does not really exist; it also effects left/right understanding, simple base ten understanding, re-grouping, etc.  My daughter understood none of it.  After the first viewing of the video, she was actually spouting out multiplication facts.  We both started to cry.  She loves stories and story-telling and is very creative so all you have to do is listen to the story and remember the characters and you'll get it.  It's the most creative math mneumonic style story I've ever seen and the ONLY thing that has worked for my daughter to help her make any gains in math and so far we've tried Khan Academy, Math Genie, Kumon, and tutors.  It's well worth the money and no I was not paid to review it.",1516838400,6,961,4.644970414201183
