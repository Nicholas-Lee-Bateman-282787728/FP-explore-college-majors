3000412,5,B000XBPDYY,"When I first saw this video I was astonished at the easy way it explained how our parents and grandparents exposures to life events and chemicals can change the future of our children. I know that many people blame vaccines on autism disorder. What if it was the grandparents vaccine that caused autism in the grandchildren? How about the incredible increase in peanut allergy. What were these victims grandparents exposed to at critical times.

3000418,5,B000XBPDYY,"Good presentation of an interesting and important topic in genetic research.
This documentary explores what may be a breakthrought theory of how environment can affect genetic expression and do so WITHOUT altering the fundamental DNA of the affected specimen. According to epigenetic theory, chemical ""tags"" attach to genetic (DNA) segments, effectively inactivating or modifying their protein production. According to preliminary research and statistical analysis of historical Scandinavian death certificates and preliminary laboratory experiments using animals, these ""chemical tags"" appear to be produced by environmental factors and are generationally transmittable.  However, it is not clear from this documentary how this generational transmission is achieved, but only presents data supporting the correlation between environmental factors and genetic responses (deficiencies mainly) and also offers the concept of ""chemical tags"" as the agents that effect the environmental influence.  This documentary and the epigenentic theory is extremely important to resolving the Nature vs Nurture debate.

My mom is a retired biologist and I watched it with her and my brother, we all found it incredibly exciting.  I have long held the belief that environment and experience can actually alter the DNA and then be passed down to future generations; but now there is actual scientific evidence to substantiate what before would have been considered my ""woo woo"" ideas.  The implications are complex and far reaching.  After seeing this my mom wistfully expressed regrets at not being 20 all over again just so that she could go into the field of genetics at this juncture in history.  Epigenetics is a fairly new field, and we have just barely begun to scratch the surface.  For us this DVD unfolded like a real thriller, and I was disappointed when it was over because I wanted there to be more; although in fact, it is packed with so much amazing information that it really needs multiple viewings to fully digest all the information contained therein.  We can't wait until there really IS more that can be substantiated.  In the meantime, I will continue with my ""way out"" ideas, feeling at least slightly more vindicated.

The field of epigenetics overall has been very focused on cancer, and this program does address cancer epigenetics but also spends a fair amount of time on non-cancer material.  This is good.  However, it does focus on heavily on DNA methylation and only briefly mentions histone modifications.

I knew that scientists anticipated that after the Human Genome was fully sequenced, we could learn much more about genetic diseases and other important information germane to potentially advancing human survival.

Epigenetics is the process of using products of biosynthesis to control which genes are turned on and off giving rise to different behaviors or phenotypes.  While this is ultimately controlled by the DNA, we must understand the epigenome as well.  The action is the epigenome is an unique emergent property of the genetic code.

8227781,5,B000XBPDYY,"The Ghost in Your Genes is a BBC Horizon publication that explores how the environmental factors a person experiences can change their genes and those of their children and grandchildren. Smoking, drugs, exercise, and stress can trigger transgenerational effects and be passed on to future generations. This documentary questions how the events that are going on now will affect generations to come.
 Chemical change during sperm or egg production can lead to a particular gene being turned on or off, which is called epigenetics. 85% of the next generations of rats were affected by those diseases, suggesting that our children will most likely have diseases based off the choices we make. When studying effects of famines, it was found that life expectancy of grandchildren was directly affected by the diet of the grandparents. Fatal childhood diabetes was associated with the paternal grandfather living during a period of reduced food supply. Environmental information, in this case supply of food, was being imprinted of the DNA of the sperm and eggs.
Through the use of first-person interviews, detailed graphs, and experts, this documentary presents the importance of considering your actions for the sake of future generations, such as how rats that were exposed to a pesticide passed on diseases to grandchildren who weren't even exposed. Parents of children whose genetic syndromes were caused by In-Vitro Fertilization spoke about the heartbreak they felt knowing that it mightve been their decision that caused this. The man who originally suggested the hypothesis spoke about his journey and struggle with mainstream scientists. The absolute joy in his voice as he spoke about being taken seriously was palpable.
Will the future children of refugees in the Middle East suffer from higher anxiety? Do we have cancer because of how much our parents or grandparents smoked? The documentary states that research will continue but only time will tell.",1513728000,,1960,5.32258064516129

I'm glad I ended up buying a copy for myself, as I've shown it to students, co-workers, family and friends. SO interesting!
