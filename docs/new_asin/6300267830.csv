282651,4,6300267830,"This is propaganda at its best! America's role in Vietnam is never under question - they're there to preserve the world from the communism threat.
Filmed during the war, it answers any criticisms glibly and its  portrayal of the media is harsh. All these newspaper reporters and media  men don't really know what's going on because they've never been there. If  in doubt, trust the government, not the media.
Moreover, the soldiers  really WANT to be there. They are committed, they are well trained, they  are everything good about America. The focus on the Green Berets - the  cream of America's fighting force - is supposed to represent the whole. The  rest may not be able to be so well trained and brave, but they are, in some  ways, represented in the Green Berets.
Given the result of the war and  the social divide it caused in America, the movie has aged badly. As an  example of unabashed, unthinking propaganda, it is priceless!",959385600,2,939,4.705521472392638
282652,1,6300267830,"I hated this movie. The acting ain't the best, and it is totally propoganda. In this movie, you don't see one M-60 machine gun or M-79 40mm granade launcher. Those were vital tools of the trade! They were given to  every squad! I may not have been there, but I read enough books, watched  enough movies and documentries, and listend to enough Vietnam Vets to know  somewhat on what it was really like. If you are interested in Vietnam,  don't get this movie, it will disapoint you. If you like WWII movies, you  will like this.",950486400,12,527,4.447916666666667

282739,4,6300267830,"Surprisingly I was in Vietnam at the time the movie was made. The only thing I can say about any reality is that I was not in or near any green berated people. I was in armed reconnaissance and as you suspected the environment was totally different. We never went anywhere without an M-60 which was not present in the movie. I was the RTO carried a radio and extra ammunition for the M-60. People that watched out for me at night carried an M-79. For that matter they did not even have a P-38 on their tag chain. The people in the tiger suits were the LRRP's. Once in a while I got to go out with them. I could fill a book with the inconsistencies.

Now putting the differences aside for this movie, it appears consistent with the larger than life John Wayne legend style. This is the style we came to know and love about his movies for over 30 years. And more were to come after this. I find it interesting that he chooses pretty much the same crew of actors to work with whether he is making a cowboy movie, a war movie, or a comedy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a demonstration of Green Beret capabilities. The audience appears to be mostly Susie home-maker and Father Knows Best. A conspicuous heckler George Beckworth (David Janssen of ""The Fugitive"" fame) in the audience is a reporter and a skeptic of the war. He gets hauled around Da Nang and thereabouts until through sharing trials and tribulations with the Green Berets come to realize that they may have not been exaggerating. We are also hauled around with no punches pulled.",1503878400,,1595,4.652482269503546

282760,5,6300267830,"What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's a masterpiece, in my opinion - a testament to the fighting men of Vietnam in general, and especially the Green Berets in particular. One of John Wayne's best movies, and that's saying a lot.

The majority of the movie surrounds an American reporter - one who doesn't believe America has any business being in Vietnam - following Wayne's unit of Green Berets into the hot zone. The unit provides relief for a camp on the front line, one that is constantly harassed by the Viet Cong and has changed hands several times. While there, the reporter gets to see not only what the daily life of a Green Beret is like, but also what kind of life the Vietnamese people have - both with and without the American soldiers.

After the camp is lost, we leave the reporter and instead follow Wayne's unit on a different sort of mission - finding and kidnapping a North Vietnamese general from within enemy lines. It's a long-shot, but as we learn, that's what the Green Berets are paid to do - risk their lives and turn the impossible goal into the successful mission.",1499385600,,1124,4.532019704433497

I think John Wayne was a little old for this.  Kind of like Burt Lancaster in Go Tell The Spartans.  As a kid it bothered me about what happened to the dog.  And what happened at the end.

282980,4,6300267830,"For years, I heard this film was right wing, jingoistic, pro-Vietnam trash.  The people who were telling me this were on the left side of politics, and many of them hadn't actually seen the movie.  They just ""knew"" it was trash or they read it was trash.  So, I decided to just watch it myself.  While it's not a masterpiece, it's a very good picture.  It's not right wing, jingoistic, or even that pro-Vietnam.  It shows what our soldiers (in this case the Green Berets) went through during the war.  It's really just an old fashioned WWII picture updated to Vietnam.  It may be the only film that wasn't critical of Vietnam, and that's fine.  Practically every movie ever made about Vietnam was critical of the war.  This one doesn't glorify war at all.  In fact, one of the main characters dies at the end in a particularly gruesome way (and other characters gets killed as well).  So it's not as ""gung-ho"" as its reputation.

The biggest flaw is that Wayne's direction (he co-directed with Ray Kellogg) is uneven.  Aside from that, it has excellent performance from Wayne and a good supporting cast.  Asian-American actors Jack Soo and George Takei have major supporting roles in the picture.  Takei said in interviews that he disagreed with Wayne on the war, and told him about it (in a polite way) the first day of shooting.  Wayne said to him that we lived in a country where we can disagree on these things and still work together, and that Wayne hired Takei because he felt he would be great in the role of a South Vietnamese officer.  And Takei gives an excellent performance in the movie.  David Janssen plays a liberal, anti-war reporter who is brought along with Wayne's platoon.  While he is with the platoon, he doesn't convert to the other side, but he has a better understanding and respect of the other side, which is just as important.

The most recent DVD edition has an excellent transfer.  An earlier DVD edition was pretty poor.  The picture was dark (making a major battle scene almost impossible to see), and it was a 2 sided DVD.  This new edition is one sided, looks fabulous, and has a vintage featurette as well.  So see this film for yourselves, and make up your minds.",1479513600,,2199,4.591259640102828

They weren't concerned with the merits of this film as a film they just wanted to voice their protest of the war.  48 years later, and viewed as just another war movie, The Green Berets does exactly what it set out to do, which was to provide pro-military support for soldiers in impossible situations.  Is it a great war movie?  No, but it is entertaining, if not overly familiar in the way the battle sequences are executed.  Also, the addition of the Liberal journalist (David Janssen) was a bit heavy-handed.  The film could have used more character development (which John Wayne asked for but was vetoed by Warner Bros who wanted more action less talk).  Even so, it was a big hit when released, much to the critics chagrin.  There is no better revenge than succeeding in the face of so much opposition.",1475020800,,908,4.666666666666667

Thanks to all Nam Vets and their family members for their Sacrifices; I served with many while in The United States Army (Semper Ra) during the Cold War (75-78).  One of the reasons I am running for President is to bring home any Nam POWs that still may be alive and being held captive, as well as provide medical treatment for Vets form all wars and actions.  I add that we did not lose the Viet Nam War; we won it, as we stopped Russia and China from sweeping down through Asia.

In retrospect, it is really a pretty good film as long as you understand that it is fiction based on the book by Robin Moore of the same title.  As such it lays out a couple of scenarios that are within the scope of published Special Forces operational capabilities.

I'm sure the first time I saw it I was young and my own father was in Vietnam.  I saw him andhis friends.  I'd imagine the next time I saw it I would have been in high school before the actual end of the war.  By then I knew people who had gone but didn't return.  I would have seen less of the Gung Ho and more of the horrors if the war.  Fast forward 10 years and I'm on a ship in the North Arabian Sea while Iran and Iraq are duking it out.  Another 10 years later and I'm in the Red Sea at the start of Desert Storm.  War, war, war.  Each time The Green Berets becomes less glamorous.

John Wayne yet again plays a larger than life man in this movie.  Yes, it's a moving film and certainly Wayne's patriotism rings through.  Up until that time we'd never lost a war and it sure as hell wasn't going to happen in The Duke's watch!",1427587200,,966,3.9635416666666665

I have worked with and trained, these heroes, that wear the coveted
Green Beret.
Special Forces has always had an air of secrecy about it, and still does.
Unless you are SF, you will never truly know everything that they do, nor
should the average citizen.
When this movie came out, it just about got the same response that ""American

But I am not going to get into anything political here.

283722,5,6300267830,"As a ""Hippie"" back in the late 60's and early 70's I protested against the war.  I did, however, see this film only once, back in the day. John Wayne was always one of our biggest flag wavers and that 's where he and I differed. I could wave the flag only if I felt my country was in the right...Wayne could wave it no matter what!  Having said all that,  I was intrigued by its showing on TCM a few weeks ago.  I thought I would see it again to see if my reaction to the theme had changed.  Shocking was that fact that I, at long last, understood our reasons for being there. This is one rip-snortin' and rousing film highlighting the famous and infamous elite troops known as ""The Green Berets"".  Wayne, as always, is a larger than life presence in this film and even as a much older man, he still commanded not only his troops, but the audience.  So convincing is he in his role, and this story, in general, I could almost feel myself being transported there in a time warp. It was often very graphic in its detail of the ways in which the Viet Cong made short shrift of their enemies.  The cast is a fine one and includes David Janssen as a skeptical Journalist, Jim Hutton as a superb ""scrounger"" who reluctantly joins the service of the Green Berets buts likes the rise in rank to Sergeant, Aldo Ray & Raymond St. Jacques portray Col. Mike Kirby's (Wayne) top kicks and aides and we even see a very young George Takei portray a Vietnamese Captain hell bent on doing his part to rid his country from the grip of the V.C. and Communism!  It is a stirring film from beginning to end and although it means to immortalize the Green Berets and their service it does so much more than that.  It highlights a time in our history when our homeland was divided against itself but tells the overall story of Vietnam within this microcosm and it does so without apology or leaning toward the propaganda of war in order to sell you a bill of goods.  It's honest, intriguing, interesting, well written and directed and is a very fine film. I bought it and I'm glad I did!",1418515200,2,2063,4.291237113402062

283807,3,6300267830,"Les Brets Verts / The Green Berets, 1968 film

It begins with a song that was very popular then. This movie is based on the novel by Robin Moore. It begins at the JFK Center for Special Warfare at Fort Bragg. The soldiers are displayed for the press. Next there is a military briefing. The soldiers tell of their expertise. The reporters ask questions. Do the soldiers only do as they are told? [Not unlike workers for a corporation.] Do the newspapers censor reports? Very true. Should we be involved? The Sergeant shows captured weapons (none from US sources). One reporter lights a cigarette. [Is this symbolism?] There is a new volunteer. Then soldiers awake for their next assignment overseas at Da Nang. Sandbags protect buildings. There is a new camp in enemy territory. [Non-professionals always smile when they appear in a movie.] One reporter wants to see things for himself.

The helicopters fly low to their destination, Dodge City. Punji sticks and barbed wire form a defensive wall. What if they are overrun? There is an escape plan. Corrugated tin is acquired. Casualties come in, there is a heavy rain. Can they get reinforcements? At night the enemy attacks with mortars. They know where to aim! The next day choppers take off for hunting the enemy. They find Regulars in the open. [Note the use of modern slang, hairy for not smooth.] The CB troops arrive to clear the perimeter. Sandbags provide shelter. [Note the use of WW II M1 carbines.] One Vietnamese soldier is accused of spying! A Zippo lighter is proof. A medic treats civilians. [Government provided health care?] Can the Colonel visit the Montagnards alone? There are boobytraps along the way. They find some people are silent. Di di Green Beret. Charlie was there. That little girl disappeared. There were other atrocities. Beckworth is impressed. There will be another attack.

The officers visit Da Nang in civilian clothes. A woman sings of Paris. At Dodge City they prepare for an attack, a ruse to distract them from the main attack. I was just talking to him! They attack before dawn, ladders over barbed wire. But a helicopter is shot down! Can they be rescued? Yes. Civilians are moved out. That young boy finds his dog. Reserves fill the breach. The attack begins, the enemy takes casualties. There are explosions and shooting [but little machine gun fire].This takes place at night so you cant see details. Fighter jets will bomb the enemy. Fall back, dammit! The combat goes on. A watchtower falls over. Fall back! Dawn shows the enemy dead bunched up! [No wonder they lost.] Fall back! Helicopters arrive to rescue people. The black-uniformed enemy run up their red and blue flag.

One soldier bought the farm. Puff the Magic Dragon gets orders to attack. High-speed Gatling guns mow down the enemy, like targets in a shooting range. Later the dead are sorted out. What do we do now, sir? They will start over again tomorrow. What happens now? Beckworth will return to write his story. A wounded soldier has a request for his memorial. Thats it. There is a plan to capture an enemy general when he arrives for a rendezvous. Soldiers jump from an airplane. One soldier finds trouble. A large mansion is well guarded. A Citron DS delivers a passenger. Crossbows eliminate guards. Silencers muffle gunshots. The general is attacked and removed. A shot sounds an alarm, but they escape. The prisoner is picked up! Another fiendish trap. Move out! That young boy is disappointed. They walk into the sunset.

There was a controversy over this movie when it was released. There were no other movies about Vietnam until years later. It seems about average. There were better movies made during WW II. Note the labored breathing of John Wayne in a few scenes. The Special Forces were created in 1952 when Truman was President, they were intended for a European war.",1416441600,,3849,4.834597875569044

283815,3,6300267830,I ordered this by accident as I thought that John Wayne was a bit too far over the hill to be protraying a Colonel in the Green Berets during the Vietnam War. The film is a classic Hollywood formula film and at times seems as if they chopped bits out of other war movie scripts and cluged them together to become The Green Berets script. A really gung-ho portrayel by John Wayne with the movie showing incredible bias to the American popular view which at this time did not have any idea what the war was really about. To the Vietnamese it was the American War which fell between the French War and the Chinese War. The only real attraction of this movie is John Wayne being the American Hero.,1414540800,,693,4.338461538461538

of soldiers to the cynical.  What we see are guerillas
in a world full of risks seeking victory by eroding and
exhausting the enemy instead of engaging him. A new kind of
war they called it, but in Vietnam it seemed to drag on
forever with ever mounting casualties.
To the surprise of almost everyone, many of these men came
home to find themselves desperately missing what others felt
should have been the worst experience of their lives, and
right back they went for another tour of duty. But where else
did they feel so needed, so absolutely necessary to their
buddies, their brothers?

""We didn't lose the war in Vietnam. Not militarily. I never was
in a single battle that we lost. Not a one. We kicked the hell
out of the VC and the NVA in every battle I was ever in.
""But we did lose something in Vietnam --- our integrity. There
was a terrible erosion of integrity within our leadership.""

284302,4,6300267830,"A movie that is on cable TV now and then. It got DVR'd back on Memorial Day weekend and just watched last night.

This movie suffers from the politics that still surrounds the VN war. The war was never viewed as a ""good"" war by a lot of people so any film that depicts it that way will have a lot of detractors.

The film has great production values and a decent, if rather far fetched story. But, as we all know, movies that are not far fetched are rarely enjoyable.

The battle scenes are well done, and the good guys win, even if they take it on the chin some.

There is no ambiguity about just who the good guys are in this picture. That probably will disturb some people.

Taken as a movie, and forgetting the politics of a war many people would prefer to forget about, it is a good war movie. It is a little long for my tastes, and the last half hour of it depicting the capture of an enemy general seems tacked on to me, and pretty contrived. It might have been a better movie if that part had been left out. It did show off some of the capabilities of the Green Berets as a fighting force, and its possible the military wanted that kind of thing added as the price of cooperating in the making of the picture. John Wayne seems a little old to be running around in the jungle and jumping out of airplanes on such raids.

284325,1,6300267830,"The motives behind making this film can be difficult for the modern viewer to understand; there is virtually no one today who thinks American involvement in the Vietnamese civil war was in any way justified.

Back then gross misunderstanding of the war, essentially boiling it down to an over-simplified conflict between capitalism and communism, led rank-and-file Americans to support drafting young men and sending them into combat in a small nation on the other side of the globe.

'The Green Berets' was released at a time when the Vietnam War was coming under increased criticism, and is nothing more than a propaganda piece intended to undermine those critics and shape the war as a classic ""good war"" like WWII. It dumbs down the complicated issues at hand and, at its core, urges viewers to march to the beat of the war drum without question.

We know John Wayne's reasons for making 'The Green Berets' - he was a mindless anti-communist. He outed and had blacklisted people in Hollywood, including screenwriter Carl Foreman, who had to write 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' from exile in Britain using someone else's name; he won the Academy Award and couldn't even take the credit until decades later. This movie is an extension of Wayne's persecution of those whose Cold War politics didn't match his own.

Today, Wayne's anti-communism seems quaint, ignorant, uniformed, paranoid, and over the top. There was no secret international cabal orchestrating communist revolutions world wide with the intent of ultimately toppling the United States. Both his views and this movie are a product of their time, and both are very much wrong and out of date.",1370131200,4,1659,5.0

284527,5,6300267830,"This is one of my favorite Vietnam movies. It is about a journalist (David Janssen) being brought in-country to experience this war for himself. It has many of my favorite actors of the time like Jim Hutton, Aldo Ray, and Luke Askew. These guy's also made other movies together with John Wayne. The story centers around Peterson (Hutton), who is a scavenger who can ""procure"" anything his unit needs. This gets the attention of Wayne, who catches him in the act. He promotes him, and brings him into his unit. Then they all go to Nam, where they move into a village that's being protected as there is a strong VC presence in the area. There, Peterson meets Ham Chunk, a really cute little Vietnamese boy who has a little dog. They bond, with the kid saying ""You funny!"". I think the whole point of this film is to show you the horrors of this war and what was happening to this country, and to introduce you to these nice people that were trying to help it out. The ending is very sad",1348963200,2,984,4.382513661202186
284528,5,6300267830,"This is probably the stupidest war movie ever made and I do like a good war movie.

As Roger Ebert pointed out when it was released, it is nothing but clichs.  Makes the Viet Nam War into a B rated cowboys versus the Indians movie.

Secondly, the actions scenes are so stupid that even if you were for the war you would cringe.  Opposing sides 30 feet apart and bunched together shooting at each other and missing.  Then hordes of enemy soldiers flinging themselves on barbed wire to be killed. NVA troops standing in the open waiting to be strafed.  And of course, everyone dies without a whimper. I mean absolutely so staged and unbelievable you have to wonder about the intelligence of the people who made it.

Finally, the simplistic conservative black and white portrayal of the war would be laughable if that attitude hadn't gotten us into the war and perpetuated it to the point of almost 60 thousand KIA. The bad guys are, of course, evil cold blooded killers using all kinds of sneaky tricks.  The good guys are all virtuous and trying to promote democracy to the poor Vietnamese, who are willing but need our help in standing up to Godless savages and attaining freedom and justice. All that's needed is our resolve in fighting the communists, something that the misguided liberal press - represented by David Janssen - needs to be taught since it is, of course, totally wrong in opposing the war.

John Wayne probably got a lot of people killed using this film to support this unwinnable war thereby prolonging it.  Of course, the conservative revisionist response to that is that they could have won it - John Wayne style - if the lefty politicians hadn't tied one hand behind their back. Of course, anyone with even the slightest understanding of the war knows that piece of revisionist history is right on par with some once obscure WW1 corporal believing his side could have won the war had they not been stabbed in the back.

This is a bad movie and a conservative hawk piece of propaganda.  I does have historical significance as a movie made during a controversial war.  We should learn from it - if nothing else as a tool to recognize when one side - in this case the right - tries to simplify a complex conflict into a black and white, God-is-on-our-side choice. Amazingly, this attitude is still alive today in Afghanistan - maybe it's just genetic and some people just view things through far right (or left) prisms and no factual argument will sway them.

Good piece of irony while watching the film is George Takei -  the gung ho Vietnamese freedom fighter who kills commies right and left in the film - turned out to be gay.",1348876800,,2649,4.6063829787234045

I was a very scared child when Nam became a possibility. I, and all my friends, knew that it was a very good possibility that we would go and fight a war and also possibly die. Yes, then you were drafted.

Today, as then, I am proud to be an American and am willing, without hesitation, to fight to keep us free.  Vets of WWII are often called the ""greatest generation"" but I have to add, vets of Nam are just as brave and did the job they were asked to do without all the crying of today's military. It's time our weak country stops belittling our brave young men that are willing to die so that we have the right to complain. This stands true to the brave young men and women that also have died in Iraq and Afghanistan.

284556,2,6300267830,"I saw this movie about 40 years ago, on television.  By that time, the social battle lines over the war had been clearly drawn.  However anyone may feel about the war, just looking at this movie on its own merits one must conclude that its not very good.
John Wayne is simply too old to be convincing in this type of role, the same goes for the other principles.  The dialouge is straight out of WWII movie and the action is loud, but thats about all that can be said for it.  As far as the acting goes, its what you would expect of the television actors and old Hollywood faces friendly to Wayne that he surrounded himself with in the declining years of his career.
This might have been John Wayne's ""personal statement"" about the Viet-Nam war but I think everyone (including the people reviewing this on Amazon) needs to remember that however Wayne felt about the war or how he wanted to present it, this movie was produced to make money.  It had no effect on public sentiment about the war or on its outcome. That it did make money when it was released at least vindicated John Wayne's continued commercial appeal with movie audiences at the time.
If you choose to look at this film as a political statement, it survives as either a rousing declaration of support for a war that seriouly divided a nation or as an out of touch curio from a bygone era.  Viewed in purely cinimatic terms, the response is simpley ""eh"".",1337904000,4,1419,4.438461538461539

284558,3,6300267830,"I feel kind of guilty for liking this movie. Sure, I'm a John Wayne fan, and a David Janssen, Jack Soo and George Takei fan. And I generally like stories about heroes, even war stories if they're not just ""war is hell"" stories. But this one has several disturbing aspects, not the least of which was having been warned away from it when it was in the theaters.

John Wayne plays Colonel Tough-As-Nails, his usual role. David Janssen is the skeptical newspaper reporter who goads the Colonel into taking him along to the combat zone by asking if he's afraid he'll see things he shouldn't see out there. What is sees, among other things, is the incredible brutality of the Viet Cong.

OK, so far so good. But there's also the problem of being able to tell your friends from your enemies, especially when they discover that the VC unaccountably know what they are doing all the time.

There's a little orphan boy who is made the mascot of the base, and sleeps in the bunk with his favorite soldier -- sure couldn't do that in a film today.

Also, there's the necessity of stealing supplies from other bases when they need something. Wayne brought along a sergeant who is expert at that for the purpose.

But the most disturbing part of all is an undercover operation, in both senses of the word. Jack Soo plays a Vietnamese colonel who works with Wayne. His sister-in-law is a beautiful singer in Danang. She knows one of the top North Vietnamese generals, who has been trying to get her into bed for a long time. So she agrees to go with him to his country home, setting a trap for him with the Green Berets. Of course she is putting herself in terrible danger in the process. Somehow, the whole operation seems a bit unsporting, you know? Particularly since all the North Vietnamese soldiers who were doing guard duty for the general's love nest are killed. I know, worse things than that can be justified in a war, but it just seemed cold, especially when Soo points out that she will be disgraced when the story gets out.

Oh, yes; and the little boy's favorite soldier just had to be killed. The script utterly required it. Otherwise, he'd have to take the kid home and adopt him.",1336953600,,2182,4.511392405063291

284610,1,6300267830,"Well, I wanted to see if this film was as bad as legend has it.  Sadly, it is and incredibly disappointing, especially considering the talent involved.  John Wayne, who had done a pretty good job directing THE ALAMO seven years before and was a very underrated actor;  Winton Hoch, one of the finest cameramen of the sound era and who won Oscars for two of the most beautifully photographed films ever-SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON and THE QUIET MAN;  David Janssen, Jim Hutton, Bruce Cabot, Aldo Ray, Raymond St. Jacques were no pikers in the acting department;  Batjac, Wayne's production company and run by his son Michael, had produced some very good films in the past (MCLINTOCK!, THE ALAMO).

This, however, is a piece of junk-plain and simple.

The script is full of howlers and cliches that were out-of-date when the film was made, the photography is second-rate, the acting is all-around amateurish and for a studio film of that period, it looks like it was thrown together more haphazardly than a Roger Corman film of the early 60's.  The classic example:  the ending shot is supposed to be on the east coast of Vietnam, with the sun setting...in the east!  I still find it hard to believe that not one person on this film noticed this gaffe-pitiful.

The main reason I purchased this Blu-Ray is that I wanted to see the film anamorphically, which the latest remaster on DVD does not do.  Fortunately the price was right and I should have this film in my collection being a fan of Wayne, but how often I take it out to watch is going to be problematical.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Alamo/dp/B00004ZBVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Alamo</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/She-Wore-a-Yellow-Ribbon/dp/B000O599NK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">She Wore a Yellow Ribbon</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McLintock-Authentic-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000ANVPPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McLintock!

284612,4,6300267830,"You may not appreciate the in your face political message, but The Green Berets (1968) is a solid and occasionally brutal film that shocks and entertains, while presenting a fairly consistent point of view.  Controversial and generally unpopular at the time, the Viet Nam conflict was not the subject of many mainstream films during the 1960's.  The Green Berets was a rare exception.  With big time production values, and a solid cast headed by the iconic John Wayne, the film plainly makes the case that with Communist forces seeking to take over the region, America's involvement in Viet Nam was justified and necessary.

Looking back now, it is easy to regard The Green Berets as overly simplistic pro-war propaganda, however the film still remains historically significant.  Media coverage at the time was perhaps lacking, a point that is made clear in the movie.  So for some, The Green Berets may have helped shape and influence their perceptions of the conflict, and served as their introduction to the M16 and punji  stick.  Claims that the film is not historically accurate may be justified, but it is perhaps unfair to hold The Green Berets to a higher standard for realism than your typical World War II adventure.

Even with a heavy handed pro-war slant, The Green Berets is still an engaging often riveting tale, particularly in the first half of this 144 minute epic.  John Wayne stars as Colonel Mike Kirby, who arrives at Fort Bragg to prepare to take a team of Green Beret to Viet Nam.  One of the key elements of the film is the inclusion of journalist George Beckworth (David Janssen), who joints Kirby's team in Da Nang as an observer.  As someone unfamiliar with the nature of the war and the enemy, Beckworth represents the audience.  His exposure to the harsh realities and brutalities of the conflict, mirrors the typical viewer.

In the jungles of Nam, the film is divided between two major operations.  The first involves the team's arrival as reinforcements at a basecamp deep in the jungle, where they immediately begin to make preparations to fortify the camp's defenses and extend the perimeter.  Much happens in the course of their brief stay.  Through interaction with the people, encounters with the enemy, acts of violence, and the cumulative effect of many personal tragedies, we form an impression of the nature and scope of the war, and the cruelty of enemy.

With an officer killed the day before he is to be sent home, and soldiers slain by traitorous Viet Cong within the camp, the writing may be heavy-handed and loaded with clichs, the results however are still quite effective, as the story quickly draws you in, and has you there in the camp with the group.  Beckworth gives a young injured girl his pendant, only to get it back the next day, after she is murder by the Viet Cong.  A bright spot occurs when Sergeant Petersen (Jim Hutton), adopts Hamchuck, a young orphan boy, but the good times are short lived.  The group's stay in the village comes to an end, when the enemy is gratuitously annihilated by mini-gun fire from a passing US plane.

The second operation is an undercover mission, working with South Vietnamese Army Colonel Cai (Jack Soo), and using his sister-in-law (Irene Tsu) as bait, to kidnap an enemy general from a safe house deep behind enemy lines.  The operation gives the team a chance to display more of their deadly skills, as after the general has been captured, the team is pursued through the jungle.  Fittingly, just as success seems to be in sight, tragedy strikes, providing a somber ending to the film, which manages to close with a faint note of hope, as a version of former Green Beret Barry Sadler's The Ballad of the Green Berets plays.

The politics that are integral to the film may bother some, but The Green Berets largely features old style WWII filmmaking, applied to a new conflict, one that did not have the same kind of public support.  Shot mainly on location in Georgia, the film serves as a testament to John Wayne's support for America's presence in Viet Nam.  It features standout performances by Jim Hutton and David Janssen, with solid work by George Takai, Aldo Ray, Raymond St. Jacques, Bruce Cabot, Jack Soo, and Irene Tsu.  The Green Berets really does look outstanding in Bluray, though regrettably there is just one extra feature.  Other films about the Viet Nam conflict would eventually follow, but with all its faults, The Green Berets is one of the landmark films about this chapter in America's history.",1308441600,2,4515,4.8046571798188875

Sure, there will always be the arguments about whether this was an honest rendering of the war.  All I can say is that you should read Robin Moore's ""The Green Berets"", from which the title and the idea of the journalist on the scene came from, and Captain Roger H. C. Donlon's book ""Outpost of Freedom"" which gave us the Camp A-107 battle model.  There are always two sides to every story and this one is told very well!

Whoever took this film from master to DVD made two blunders.  When they tried to keep it in letter box, the studio somehow managed to ""squeeze"" the left side so that anyone over there will have a slimmer head.  Secondly, you won't find it anywhere on the case and only in very small print, visible with a flashlight,on the disc, but the movie is split front and back.

As an adult I continue to collect his work and enjoy them over and over. I spent 30 years in the Army which started in 1968 and his character and the plot of the movie is very believable and true to the real life war in Vietnam. The rhetoric, clothing, operations and missions and all else about the movie are within acceptable tolerances for this story. The booby traps, the visciousness of the Viet Cong against their own people and the missions are true to life. This movie will be represents actual places, people and events in our military history that should help Americans honor the fewer and fewer Vietnam veterans in our great nation who fought a war that wasn't fought to be won (in my own opinion). A lot of them weren't honored when they came home, they were branded as ""baby killers"" and the like which caused untold mental agony and distress. God bless 'em (us).
As a side note, his westerns are entertaining and action filled. One of the reasons I enjoy them so much is the screen writer he used for so many years, especially his westerns, James Edward Grant. He is the one who put the Duke's famous phrases onto the screen; phrases like, ""a man's got to do what a man's got to do"", and ""Comfortable?!?! I've been called a lot of things in my life, but comfortable was not one of them."" The legend lives on in his movies, as does each of the actors that worked with him for all those decades.

reviewing my politics, not my movie"" and he was right. But I think it goes farther than that. Movie critics are largely out
of touch with the people who actually go to see movies. It`s pretty much always been that way and still is today. Back in the
20s and 30s the critics hated Laurel & Hardy films, but the people loved them. And little has changed today. I always figure
if the critics don`t like a movie it might be worth watching. It`s not always the case, some films are just so bad that both
the critics and the people think they stink.
But that`s not the case with this film. It`s actually pretty good. Not great, or a classic, but a pretty good basic war hero
type movie that had good acting and directing. The plot and story were a little old and worn even back then. It`s your basic
WWII war movie transported into the 1960s southeast asia.
People need heroes, both real and fictional. John Wayne was a master at providing the public with larger than life fictional
characters. These characters often have little to do with reality, but movies rarely have much to do with reality either.

There is an interesting lecture to the press by the military early on and that's worth listening to, whether you agree with it or not. John Wayne played his normal tough-on-the-outside-but very human-on-the-inside role, which he so often did in his westerns. This movie also was made right when the Hays Code had been abolished but they still refrained from profanity, to their credit, although it certainly would have been understandable being a war flick.

There were a number of lulls in here to show the soldiers being more than just killing machines. There is one very touching scene with a little boy whose soldier friend does not come back alive. From a war standput, there were Viet Cong booby traps that were brutal but interesting to see.

Today's generation will have seen similar either by Clint Eastwood or Oliver Stone. The added value for those of us too young to have experienced it is to get a glimpse of what life like could be like at the front(often obscured in this war), in the 1960's or 70's or off duty, and the environment faced among people then in contrast to the present. It is entertaining and certainly a film needed at the time to portray the professional soldier in a war 'unpopular', as much as there is a need today when facing Iraq, Afghanistan and international engagements in among other, Africa.

Heh, can't believe everything ya here. John Wayne did die of cancer, but I'm affraid he was indeed full of it, just in other ways. This film THE GREEN BERETS is impacted with enough nonsense to be harmful to the society that consumes too much material of this kind. The movie is well known for containg many technical errors including depiction of a sunset that takes place in the east. I wonder how many Americans would to this day know and or even notice that the country of Vietnam has no western coastline? How many would care is perhaps even more important a question.

I wish we could go back to the days when Hollywood supported the military, the way this movie does. The thing that bothers me most about the Vietnam war is that we could have won it. North Vietnamese Generals have admitted as such, in documentaries. But widespread treason was committed by our left-wing media, and the leftist Hollywood types. Which I believe helped turn some Americans against the war. So we ended up losing the PR war.
 A lot of good people died in Vietnam. We should have honored their service by winning that war, rather than spitting on them when they came home. If anything, this movie reminds us not to ever let that mistake be repeated.

284840,3,6300267830,"Here we get a simplistic view of a very complex war. We didn't know in 1968, when this film was released and when the action for American soldiers in Vietnam was very hot indeed, that it would be a full seven years before this political morass of a conflict would be ultimately ended and that the Americans would lose the war. In fact, in '68, the idea that we could possibly lose the Vietnam War probably didn't even occur to the average American.

I said all that to lay the proper groundwork for the film. This is clearly a pro-war movie and it has suffered significant critical review (especially in retrospect) as a result. Hollywood drew upon their biggest gun, John Wayne, for the role of the tough and heroic Colonel Mike Kirby who ultimately ""wins the battle"" -- even Hollywood anticipated the risk of going out any further on a limb than this, given that they were no doubt more clearly apprised of the otherwise little-known actualities of America's lack of direction and progress in Vietnam.

The story itself is a simple one: American soldiers are trying their best to crush the purveyors of horrific Communism and thus save the vulnerable South Vietnamese people from eternal, unfathomable atrocities which were generally associated with the North Vietnamese rulers and Vietcong soldiers during this time period. This Herculean task was to be accomplished, in this case, through superior tactics, by the employment of superior American weaponry, and, through the patriotic intestinal fortitude of John Wayne's sterling leadership. Of course, this microcosm of the war was allegedly representative of what we were supposedly doing all over South Vietnam.

What you will NOT see in this film, which most later movies exploited, is drug use by American soldiers, prostitution for the troops offered by  Vietnamese women who were trying to survive their circumstances, or any of the other common, supplementary, and graphic appurtenances to the typical lengthy war. Other than Jim Hutton's little humorous Black Market escapades, it's mostly shooting and body counts. Here, the viewer can expect a very straightforward presentation of battle, tenoned with the occasional swatch of personal anguish.

""The Green Berets"" is the antithesis to the more self-loathing, later-period, movies like ""Apocalypse Now,"" (1979) and ""The Deer Hunter,"" (1978). And it's probably accurate to say that each of these three flicks were reflective of the American public's general sentiment (in hindsight of Vietnam, regarding the latter two) at the time of their respective releases. I feel certain that both LBJ and Nixon would have wished for the production of a lot more movies like ""The Green Berets"".

I based my 3-star rating on my view of the film AFTER having separated it from period politics. It's well-done in terms of cinematography, is supported by a quality filmscore (composed and effected by Miklos Rozsa), bulging with notable stars of the era (Jim Hutton, Mike Henry, Jack Soo), albeit I've never been a huge fan of David Janssen. I've always been turned off by his eternal despondence and grimness throughout his film career, ergo ""The Fugitive"" television series. In the end, one can't escape the propaganda feel of this film. Even at the time of its initial release I recall thinking that it was pretty stiff, and wreaking somewhat of Ozzie and Harriet-ness.

""The Green Berets"" was filmed at Fort Benning, Georgia and if you look closely, you can spot that they utilized caucasians as some of the Vietcong soldiers. I do think that it was a fine performance by John Wayne, even though I'm not exactly rabid on The Duke as some folks are. Still, one cannot deny that he was perfect in the role. The film was co-directed by Ray Kellogg, John Wayne, and Mervyn LeRoy, the latter being uncredited.

To summarize, I still enjoy seeing this film occasionally but about the only accurate part of it was the portrayal of the media's rising cynicism in regard to our continuing role in Vietnam.",1204329600,4,3998,5.010542168674699
284841,2,6300267830,"I read someone else's review about this, and it peaked my interest enough to write my own about a movie that is a misfire on many levels from the outset to the bitter end.

First, there's the dialogue, which is ueber patriotic from the get-go to build support for the war. (It was released in 1968). Some of it will give you the chills of embarrassment when a South Vietnamese Army captain says: ""First, kill all stinking Cong..."" You forget the rest of what he says as you feel your face flush red and wonder why the two actors he's addressing aren't laughing their web gear off. An abundance of military colloquialisms, popular at the time seem inserted rather than natural e.g. ""bought the farm"" or ""Puff, the Magic Dragon."" Loosely translated that means you're dead and you're about to die--respectively.

Next, we have the plot.

One lone reporter is anti war and antagonistic to the mission of US Army Special Forces (Green Berets), and he's going to prove it by going to Vietnam and see it first hand. He attends an orientation at Ft. Benning where the scenes, especially of the airborne school, are real. It is during this part of the movie that John Wayne is trying mightily to remember his lines, and not appear like someone who should have retired twenty years earlier.

Next we see Jim Hutton, an enlisted greenie beanie who is a scrounger which translates as thief, who sleeps in ""jammies,"" and has a 1941 style barracks full of collectibles that no self-respecting special forces soldier would be caught dead with.

Now the rest of the characters who all go to Vietnam:

They are as numerous and predictable as it is easy finding cheese in any box of C rations. Sergeant Muldoon is the tough senior NCO and weapons expert who liked to make things explode with his chemistry set as a kid. (No kidding)! There's the mild-mannered doc who inoculates entire villages. There's Jackie Soo who appears that he hasn't graduated from acting school but you secretly hope will start singing ""A Hundred Million Miracles."" Then there's Sgt. Provo, who before you can say, ""There's a snake in my boot,"" notices that names of every building in country are named after someone who was killed in action. (Gee, guess what happens to him)! Next, a cute Vietnamese boy trying to look like a puppy dog without a tail sees the Hutton character Sgt. Peterson as a father-figure. So, naturally, you know what's going to happen to Hutton.

After saving Vietnamese and fighting off VC attacks, lo' and behold, the reporter played by Michael Jansen says that he's going home to write something different that his editors will not like. (Ya' don't say)! John Wayne is proud of him. And of course, there's the little Vietnamese boy who runs to each returning helicopter to see if his Sgt. Peter ""San"" has returned. John Wayne goes to talk to him.

There is plenty of shoot-em up action matched by an equal number of dull moments and bad dialogue. John Wayne goes by the code name, Bulldog. That seems about right as this movie is a complete hund.

Avoid this like you would a horseshoe ambush.

In this memorable scene, the men had just come across a booby trap consisting of a camouflaged pit in which sharpened bamboo stakes, which were often poisoned, had been emplaced. This symbolized the underhandedness of the Communists.

This movie harks back to a time, in the not-so-distant-past, when Hollywood still made movies that supported the US military. It also reminds us of the time when the US was divided into hawks and doves; with John Wayne the hawk par excellence!",1200268800,7,592,5.040816326530612

284876,3,6300267830,"The common approach to reviews for The Green Berets seems to focus on whether or not the reviewer was in favor of the war and then either praise the movie or condemn it based on that.  I thought I'd try something different and review this as a movie without providing an op-ed piece on the war itself.

First off, the cast in this movie is its strong point.  John Wayne and David Janssen are the two biggest names but a lot of wonderful character actors provide the movie with a heart and soul that go well beyond what the script provides.  Wayne himself gives one of his best performances and Jim Hutton is especially memorable as Sgt. Peterson.

The story first follows Wayne to a US camp set up in Viet Cong (VC) territory.  He leads an effort to prepare for an assault that they know will come.  The defense of the camp takes up roughly the first two thirds of the movie.  Then, with almost no transition, there is a covert mission to kidnap a VC general behind enemy lines.  The camp story frankly drags and could have been cut by at least 20 minutes without losing anything.  The mission to kidnap the general is really laughable.  I'm sorry to say that it's like something a 12 year old would imagine a covert operation to be.  Wayne is one of two middle-aged colonels and at least three sergeants go along... all chiefs and no Indians.  Special forces missions are run by young, fit men who are the best of the best not by men who primarily sit behind a desk.  Since the movie was already running long, it's a bit of a mystery to me why they felt this second story needed to be grafted onto the end like that.

Overall, the Green Berets is not one of Wayne's better movies.  I love the cast and they alone do make it watchable, but probably not enjoyable for many.  As is also obvious from the other reviews here, there is a strong pro-war sentiment and if that offends you then this will certainly not help your enjoyment of the film.  I just wish that a top-notch writer had been employed to improve the script, as the movie would certainly have benefited from it.  As it is, I can only recommend it to true fans of the great John Wayne, as they will be more forgiving of the film's obvious flaws.",1187395200,5,2207,4.339024390243902
284877,5,6300267830,"In light of America's present situation in Iraq in  July,2007, it is quite natural that the Vietnam experience is being viewed in hindsight and films like this are getting a new viewing.

 First, this movie is based on a  1964 novel about the Green Berets. When it was released in 1968 in the aftermath of the Tet Offensive(which America won) the American public and its leadership had rejected the overly optimistic outlook and bought the line the war was unwinnable and America should withdraw regardless of what happened to the South Vietnamese. If this was released in 1964, when there were few war critics outside of leftist and Black nationalist circles, it would have accurately reflected this country's view of South Vietnam and the war in 1964.

  Second, John Wayne is like many war movie stars. It is a known fact that Charlie Sheen (Platoon), Mel Gibson( When we were Soldiers) Chuck Norris (Missing in Action 1,2and 3) and Sly Stallone (First Blood 1,2 and 3) never served in combat or the military. However, John Wayne did tour South Vietnam with the USO. Movie actors are selected on box office drawing power not their backgrounds. If John Wayne wasn't in this movie, would this be a classic ?

  Third,  this movie didn't accurately portray the corruption, nepotism, indecisiveness and bad decisions of the South Vietnamese army and its officials (which led to South Vietnam's defeat in 1975). It also didn't show the American killing of civilians (which did not occur regularly until after the big build up began in 1965 and were generally committed by units such as the Americal Division with suffered from bad leadership). What it did show was North Vietnamese troops were active in South Vietnam before 1965 (the left always denies this). their slaughter of civilians in this movie was a glimpse of what they were to do in Hue in 1968 (the left still says the massacre never happened) and in all of South East Asia after 1975.

  Finally, John Wayne did do something that wasn't common at the time in military movies, he put a African-American actor (Raymond St. Jacques) in a leading role. Jacques portrayl of Sgt McGhee came accross as very dignified and intelligent. As the medic of the unit, he was ask by Lt. Col. Kirby (Wayne) for advice. Although John Wayne was not known to be a Civil Rights supporter and considered to be a racist by many radical Black circles, the character of Sgt McGhee was a breakthrough in potrayal of African-Americans in the movies.

  I watched this movie along with Platoon during my basic training at Fort Dix, N.J. in 1987. The recruits loved it! However, this was during the Reagan era when the cold war was a fact of life. Those supporters and critics should accept this movie for what it is John Wayne's view about a war based on a novel that was written when most of America shared his views on Vietnam.",1183334400,8,2864,4.730382293762576

The movie shows something not often demonstarted in Oliver Stone and similiar lefties Vietnam movies-the suffering of Vietnamese by the commies and the loyal support of the Montanyards(sp?) to America.

284880,4,6300267830,"I am awarding ""The Green Berets"" four stars merely because of its importance to our national debate concerning Vietnam.  Other then that, it is aesthetically speaking a mediocre movie.  It is definitely not Academy Award material.  Was John Wane unable to find suitable investors within the left-wing Hollywood community?  Should we assume that the movie was made on a shoe string budget?  Whatever, Wayne should not have been so involved in the production.  The screen play is mediocre and the direction is about what would expect in a made for TV movie.  The actors mouth embarrassing  cliches.  Even the music score was awful.  Am I a leftist who disagrees with Wayne's position on the war?  Nope, he and I are on the exact same page.  The United States was valiantly trying to save the Vietnamese people from the evil Communists.  Unfortunately, our troops were stabbed in the back by the leftist media and it allies.

Watching ""The Green Berets"" is something of an unpleasant experience.  John Wayne obviously meant well.  It is sad that this desperately needed movie was not better.  It may have made a huge difference in convincing the American people to stay the course.

It is rather straightforward in its point, blame the government all you want for the problems of the war, but not the soldiers. They were doing what they are supposed to do, follow orders which the swore they would. John Wayne slaps the liberal media early and often in this film and reminds the public that what you are told by American newspapers and television reporters nowadays is hardly the whole truth, if the truth at all. Wayne shows that the men who fought and even died in the war were real people, who had people who cared for them, and that the war was more than just our military personnel dressed in uniforms versus theirs. They didn't fight by the West's rules of war. The enemy used women, children, and had no qualms about destroying civilian targets just the same as military.

Without reference to what side this movie is advocating, I think it is generally a good and interesting film with good acting.

That being said, the bias of the film is not as strong as some would like to make it seem. The war was a very decisive issue and was a major dividing line in the 1960's and 1970's. I think we can sit back now, and watch this film for what it is worth. Even if we don't necessarily share the patriotic feelings that the maker of the film seems to have. We do well to realize that it is an interesting film put together by people who had a particular perspective on this war.

284930,5,6300267830,"In the 1960s when America was under worldwide attack from

communism and free people everywhere were at risk, liberals

took control of our media for the most part.  Only a few brave

men opposed them and one of the bravest was John Wayne.

John Wayne was a real american.  He was what every man wanted

to be and what every woman wanted.  He loved his country and

hated its enemies.  Thats why he made this film.

He made this film because America had to be shown what the

war on communism was about.  It was about saving lives on

the frontlines and the frontiers of freedom.  And about

supporting our troops who were fighting for our freedom.

The best character in the film is little Ham Chuck who learns

all the lessons of freedom from his green beret friends including

the price of freedom in lives of those who are fighting for it.

You could see that little fellow after an american victory

leading vietnam on the road to development and into the family

of free nations.  But we all know that because we sold him

out, he either fortunately ended up in a refugee camp or he

ended up being put in a tiger cage for the rest of his life

if he wasn't lucky.  He had learned too much of freedom and

of the american way to ever be allowed to run loose in a

communist country.

Wayne knew that the Vietnam war above everything else was

about human decency.  We all know that millions were murdered

by communists after we sold out the side of freedom.  Wayne

knew that would happen even years earlier and tried to tell

the world what was going on with this film.

Vietnam was a war worth fighting and worth winning.  The mistakes

we made was in fighting with one arm tied behind our back, not

giving the troops what they needed to win, and trying to fight

a war by obsolete rules.  We also made the mistake of setting

goals and timetables.  A reporter who asked when the war was

going to end should have only been given the response ""when

we win"".",1109376000,14,1968,4.3121546961325965
284931,3,6300267830,"When this movie was released in the 60s it received a mixed reaction from a country that was starting to rethink its policies in Southeast Asia. While the movie does capture a flavor of the situation in Viet Nam, it is unabashedly patriotic and glosses over the downsides of the situation in Vietnam. Yet, getting past the politics and the residual feelings that Vietnam has left in the minds of many, this movie is actually a fair action movie.

The movie is really several stories put together. The movie follows a group of Green Berets as they are transferred to Viet Nam. The beginning of the movie explains the enemy in Viet Nam and why we were in Vietnam with the logic of the time. The logic was rooted in the kind of idealism that carried us through World War II, and was not truly applicable to the situation in Vietnam. After laying the groundwork for why we should be in Vietnam, we soon meet a Wayne movie regular, Jim Hutton playing Sgt. Peterson, or Peter-Sahn as Hamchuck (Craig Jue), a Vietnamese orphan, calls him. Soon the team is on their way to Vietnam.

Once in Vietnam the group's mission is to be part of the teams establishing bases in the hills to serve as points of stability for the locals, protecting them from the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). The movie takes the opportunity to point out how evil and cruel the enemy is toward women and children, and men too, as we see innocents ruthlessly murdered. We also see a firefight where the NVA win and the somewhat stereotypical aftermath scene where the NVA remove anything and everything of value from the dead left in an overrun camp.

Later the group of Green Berets go on a mission to capture a North Vietnamese general, and once again the movie takes the opportunity to point out how morally corrupt the enemy is. Along the way we see a sophisticated booby-trap kill one of the principal characters to set up the poignant ending.

David Janssen plays reporter George Beckworth, who tags along with the Green Berets from the beginning to the end. He represents those with an anti-war sentiment, and the movie shows how his ""misconceptions"" of the war are overcome by the incidents he encounters. By the end of the war George has become convinced that we are doing the right thing in Vietnam, and through truth, justice and the American way we will prevail.

There are several scenes in this movie that are interesting and contain a combination of accuracy and inaccuracy. The balloon extraction system that was used to remove the Vietnamese general from the jungle was also used in the James Bond movie ""Thunderball."" There was an actual system and aircraft to pick up an object on the ground, though I have always wondered what that stress would do to a human body. An even better scene was when Puff the Magic Dragon was used. Puff was an AC-47, a modified version of the C-47, the military version of the DC-3, with Gatling guns mounted on the left side of the plane. While the configuration was relatively simple, it concentrated an incredible amount of firepower in a small area. This plane was the precursor of the significantly more powerful and sophisticated AC-130 Spectre Gunship, the most recent version of which goes by the call sign ""Spooky."" The scenes of the helicopters taking off and returning from missions are also impressive, though helicopter technology has advanced significantly in the decades since this war.

It is easy to pick at this movie with its distortion of the situation in Vietnam and its incredibly stereotypical characters. Add to that the gross inaccuracies, such as the sun setting into the ocean off the Vietnamese coast, which faces east, and the movie can seem like poorly veiled propaganda film. However, without considering the era and the Duke you miss the point. This movie was John Wayne's personal statement regarding Vietnam. He, and many others, felt we should be there because it was the right thing to do; that it was human decency to prevent what would, and did, happen if the North Vietnamese won. Many of us truly believed that the North Vietnamese communists were more evil than the corrupt government of the south.

If you ignore the propaganda, and that this movie is about the Vietnam War, and that later movies covered the topic much better, you end up with a movie in the tradition of World War II movies where it was easy to define who the good guys and the bad guys were, and our principal motivation to be there was good versus evil and right versus wrong. This movie is a sobering end to an era for our country and in film-making. From this point forward we would realize that rarely are situations black and white and would need to be more careful in how we approached situations such as this. If this film did nothing else, perhaps it helped us to realize how complicated the world actually is.",1109116800,4,4857,4.673684210526316

about an old football injury, but it was only a yellow streak

that kept him out of uniform.

This movie has nothing to do with the real war in vietnam.

Its a bunch of ideas strung together from what Wayne saw on

TV and what some of his officer groopies who never left Saigon

told him about the war.

The first half of the movie has a traitorous reporter (Cliff

Robertson) learn the real story of vietnam.  He goes with Wayne

to vietnam to what is supposed to be a special forces jungle

camp on the vietnamese border.  Its fort apache, vietnam after

that.  Complete with noble slow-taking indian scouts (the

vietnamese), friendly indian tribes (the mongonards) and the

evil indians (the viet cong).

Being bad people, the viet cong kill, rape and rob everyone in

sight with Cliff Robertson seeing it all and learning to love

the war.  Then we get to the big attack on the fort.  Wayne

and company get to mow down wave-after-wave of evil vietnamese.

After a whole lot of people are dead, the reporter is convinced

of what a great struggle for freedom this is and promises to

support the war in his newspaper when he gets back to America.

The stupidity of it all is that the obvious question never gets

asked.  Why, if we are fighting on the side of good and right,

is the enemy able to get so many people to fight and die?

Wayne would probably say that they were victims of commie

brainwashing.

The truth about vietnam is South Vietnam and its army were

weak, incompentent and not popular.  Toward the early 70's,

they were more interested in making money off selling whores

and heroin to the US Army than in fighting for their own

country.

The only way for America to have won the war would have been

to expand it to a point where the Chinese would have entered

the war to save north vietnam which would have put us in the

same meat-grinder that Korea turned into.

What stupid people like Wayne never got was that you don't

send the US Army to save a country that can't and won't

defend itself.  You send them weapons, not troops.  If they

can't use the weapons and can't defend themselves, they were

never worth anything in the first place.  And if the enemy

can inspire five people to die while you can't get even one

to stand and fight, something is really wrong.

The second half of the movie is interesting. Wayne's super

commandos are sent in to raid the Viet Cong's pentagon and

bring out some general.  The Viet Cong HQ is a mansion with

silver tea services, servents, electricity and late model

staff cars.  The plan is to whore out the sister of one of

their south vietnamese soldier-followers to the general, sneak

in and knock the general out, wake the guards starting a

firefight and then flee to safety in the General's staff car.

There is a great scene afterward where Wayne, American Pimp,

lectures his south vietnamese friend to get over pimping out

his sister for the war effort.  American morality at its

finest.  All that was missing was Wayne talking about how the

woman now had new career opporunties open to her in Saigon.

Here was a guy, John Wayne, who never had any guts in his whole

life making a flag-waving film about how everyone else should

send their kids off to die in vietnam.  People talk lots about

patriotism, but being a patriot means actually doing something

and putting something at risk.  Its not about making movies

pretending to be a hero when your a fat drunk sitting around

the pool eating steaks every night.  He didn't join up in WWII,

he didn't send any of his kids to fight after.  Thats not a patriot, thats a loud-mouth idiot.  And he doesn't give a damn

about Vietnam or the people there.  You can see in the movie

that all he really cares about is fighting the red menace in

the abstract.  Wayne does his fighting across the bar and the

dinner table while less important people are supposed to go

beat the communists.

If you want a true hollywood hero, try Audie Murphy.  He was

the real deal rather than the phony image John Wayne lived

off his whole life.

But really, most of America would rather be sold the phony

John Wayne image of solider than to honor, remember or even

care about the sort of real men who defend this country.",1109116800,22,4539,4.473489519112207

Colonel Mike Kirby, the Duke, has been ordered to form two teams of Green Berets and head into South Vietnam for two missions. The first is to help build Army base camps deep in Viet Cong territory, and the second is to capture an important North Vietnamese general deep in the Cambodian jungle. For many years critics have unfairly ripped this movie to pieces because Wayne inserted his own beliefs in the movie.  The Green Berets is an exciting, old-fashioned war movie that in reality could be set in WWII in the Pacific Theater if it wanted.  This is a highly enjoyable Duke adventure with plenty of action and really a lot of fun overall. Don't listen to the critics' reviews and you'll really enjoy this movie.

John Wayne stars as Colonel Mike Kirby, the leader of two teams of Green Berets with several dangerous missions to take care of near the Cambodian border.  Even in his 60's, Wayne was still an intimidating figure. David Janssen plays cynical journalist David Beckworth, who does not understand why the United States are involved in Vietnam. Jim Hutton is excellent as Sgt. Peterson, a scrounger who takes a Vietnamese orphan(Craig Jue) under his wing. Wayne's team of Green Berets include some of his regulars including Aldo Ray, Raymond St. Jacques, George Takei, Patrick Wayne, Luke Askew, Edward Faulkner, Mike Henry, Chuck Roberson, Eddy Donno, and Rudy Robbins. The film also stars Bruce Cabot, Jack Soo, Irene Tsu, and Jason Evers. The DVD offers widescreen presentation, trailers from 7 John Wayne movies, and a promotional featurette.

After the Navy Seals (formerly called the Underwater Demolition Teams), the Special Forces group known in the Vietnam war as the 'Green Berets' were one of the toughest, most dangerous groups of fighting men in the world.  The men in theatre called them 'snake eaters' because of their training in survival and living off the land.

Other such elite groups includes, but are not limited to,  the British Royal Marine Commandos, British Special Sea Service (SAS), a couple of Israeli groups, Rangers, Paratroopers, French Foreign Legion, and last but not least by any means, our Delta Force.  The United States Marine Corps also rates high mention because of their training, courage, brilliant history, and esprit de corps.

In Yokosuka, Japan, in 1950 during the Korean war, in a corridor in an administrative office, I once was faced with two very large men in great physical condition. They were friends. They were the commanding officers of Underwater Demolition Team One and the Royal Marine Commandoes.  I would not have wanted to meet them in a dark alley--particularly if I were their enemy.

This movie is exclusively about the Green Berets, so designated because of the color and type of uniform headgear that they wear.  The movie also made popular the song, Ballad of the Green Berets, lyrics by Sgt. Barry Sadler.

John Wayne plays the part of Colonel Mike Kirby.  The cast is filled with eminent actors, all of whom do a superb job.  The story revolves around the Berets protecting an isolated wilderness post from Viet Cong attack and the congruent villages and villagers from the brutality and cruelty of the VC.  In a subsequent mission, Kirby, with a small group, abducts a North Vietnamese general.  Like most John Wayne movies, it reflects some truth about our armed services and the requirements of service, is patriotic in nature, and leaves one feeling somewhat uplifted.  That was his intent, in everything he portrayed on the screen.

This is an interesting, action filled and tense drama which achieved much critical acclaim at the time of its release.  I commend it to you.

284968,5,6300267830,"if John Wayne had made something like this today he would be ostracized from all of Hollywood and from about 2% of this nation.  he was a man, a patriot and he wanted to show the good of our struggle.  vietnam was a war that was not unlike every other war, the only difference was our citizens.  the baby boomers grew up spoiled (founding fathers of the modern left).  they didn't understand hard work and what a country need's to do for freedom.  the left will today say freedom is a slogan, that we will always be free, they will say bush's war is for oil or some uneducated and clichd response, but freedom is not just about a war or occupation, it's the freedom to not be afraid to get on a airplane, the freedom to not fear going into tall buildings, the freedom not to fear gathering large groups in public. and for the arab world it means to not be afraid to have your wife drive your car, or wear a dress in public, or to question a religious authority. the whole idea of vietnam was to prevent the spread of communism, it was a war that transcended vietnam itself, it was a war to measure our country and our people's resolve.  vietnam taught our enemies (and todays modern terrorists) that if they can scare us, horrify us or kill enough of us that we will cower and not fight.  Stalin, Khrushchev, khadafi, Usama, and hussein thought this, and we taught them all a lesson through might.
just because liberal's think war is not the answer it does not mean that our enemies do also.  we are not europe, if we do not spend money on our military, flex our muscles, set deadlines and take action no one ele will.  we do not have anyone to protect us like europe and the world have us.  terrorist do not seek peace, they do not hate us because we are us they hate us because of hollywood, because of our freedom from starvation, our comfort in life and from our belief that we can live life any way we want without regard.
John wayne in his portrayal of vietnam was not ""propaganda"" it was to boost moral for the country, to support our efforts in defeating communism.  i read before someone said john wayne was no patriot, what is a patriot if not to support the united states and to keep it's moral up?  john wayne did that, ask any soldier from WWII to the present day.  i feel bad for the liberal's they hate everyone, stand for everything while believing in nothing and really do not know anything of history or of humanity.",1086912000,17,2434,4.323076923076923

Now, the film is as accurate as any other Vietnam film made in that last 30 years because films are created to promote an opinion.  (I've known Vietnam Vets who were not dope smoking, gun-totting genocidists.)
As far as action and commitment, the Green Berets succeeds as a solid ""war film.""  No one who cares about good film making can argue that, unless they believe in censorship.  The film is panoramic and energetic in cinematic quality.  The characters are strong male types (like Vets I've known.)  The film chose its side and promoted it.  There is one strong element that the film brings home.  The US military was better at killing, and it had to be.  Most US detachments were generally outnumbered, fighting an opposition armed by numerous totalitarian countries from Europe to Asia.  That is a historical fact, which interestingly enough, was introduced into a film over 35 years old.

284971,4,6300267830,"If you ever read Gustav Hasford's ""The Short-Timers"" (which ""Full Metal Jacket"" was based on) you know how he felt about this movie: ""Let's watch the Duke and Mr. Sulu karate-chop Victor Charlie in a Kodicolor fantasy about Vietnam."" In other words, he thought it was bunk. So does everyone else on the left, who have bought into the myth that Vietnam was a purely guerilla war and that the human-wave assaults employed by the NVA/VC on Col. Kirby's camp in the film would never have happened in real life. In point of fact almost 90% of the fighting in Vietnam was of the conventional type in the Central Highlands or the valleys (""We Were Soldiers"") while only 10% of the troops were employed in the rice paddies you see in movies like ""Platoon."" Whenever the NVA fought out in the open, a la the Tet Offensive, they were well and truly beaten, but their leadership was ruthless and understood that by trading 5 Vietnamese lives for one American, the U.S. will to fight would eventually break. They knew the American public had only tepid support for Vietnam and would not accept the losses. The result, of course, we all know. Hanoi Jane what she wanted and so did Uncle Ho. Too bad Jane didn't go back in say, 1975 and spend some time in a re-education camp. They could have taken pics of her in a tiger cage, eating bugs and rotting from typhus.
If you are reading this you probably know the story of the movie.
John Wayne's Col. Kirby and his elite Special Forces ""A"" Team (no, not the one with Hannibal and Face and B.A. Barracus)is sent to Vietnam to establish base camps which offer protection to the local farmers from the murderous Viet Cong (whose crimes against their own people are well documented here). The soldiers teach the locals how to fight while providing basic medical care and 20th century improvements to their primeval way of life. There is the usual big John Wayne type battle as the VC try to overrun the camp, followed by a commando raid deep into enemy territory, and a tragic-heroic ending. But the movie is more than the sum of its parts. It is not mere entertainment, it is personal propiganda, designed to present the Duke's argument for why America was fighting in Vietnam at all. The only failing is its sappiness and jingoism, which make it easy for opponents to ridicule. But making fun of it doesn't take away the fact that the Duke's argument was based on something he is rarely credited for -- human decency. What ""right"" did we have in Vietnam? I guess the same ""right"" we had to land on the beaches of Normandy. We had no ""right"" at all -- it was just the ""right thing to do"", to support a bad government (South Vietnam) against a much worse government (North Vietnam) that used methods like mass killings of teachers, civil servants, nuns, missionaries, and village chiefs to destabilze the South and forcibly unite the country. You can argue about the legitimacy of taking sides in a civil war all day, but any country that uses methods like burying people alive and raping women to death as a matter of military policy probably deserves to be opposed, yes?
Anyway, let me take a moment to say I LOVE THIS FREAKIN' MOVIE. Growing up, good old Washington D.C. Channel 20 (remember when you only had ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS and your one local channel? Channel 20 was ours) played this movie, (along with ""The Battle of the Bulge"" and ""The Bridge at Remagen"" and some other classics) about once every other day. Even the thought of it brings a smile to my face. Here was a guy, John Wayne, who had the guts to make a film this flag-shakingly right wing at a time when patriotism was growing unfashionable and millions of people were abandoning and spitting on the ideals that he embodied -- which, by the way, a few of us still hold true. As a movie, ""The Green Berets"" has a hard ideology of anti-communism and shows the newfangled Special Forces as a sort of elite brotherhood consecrated to fight against it. I think a lot of the hate directed against this movie comes from the surity of Kirby's (meaning John Wayne's) beliefs. They are rock-solid and not up for debate or negotiation. He understands what will (and did) happen to Vietnam if the North wins the war, and fights bitterly to prevent this from happening, while simultaneously trying to win over a stubborn journalist who has legitimate doubts about our involvement.

As a veteran of many covert low intensity wars, dedicated Colonel Mike Kirby of the US Special Forces, John Wayne leads a dedicated ""A"" team of highly skilled ""Professors of Warfare"" deep behind enemy lines in VN. Based in part on Capt. Roger Donlon's heroic and harrowing defence of a Green Beret outpost that won him the 1st Congressional Medal of Honour awarded in Vietnam, John Wayne is at his patriotic best in his realistic potrayal of a veteran of many, many wars fighting his country's enemies. The footage of an AC130 gunship ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" that terminates the VC that have over run the Special Forces camp is chilling in its depiction of quick death from the sky. Fascinating too to military buffs are the techniques of sentry silencing shown including garotting, as well as the use of the STABO extraction rig used to extract the enemy NVA General for interrogation. John Wayne's parting line as the sun sets over Danang, when he puts the Green Beret over the head of the orphan Vietnamese boy ""Ham Chunk"", ""You're what this is all about, Green Beret"" brings tears to your eyes. The plight of the boat people after the fall of Saigon showed beyond a shadow of a doubt that what John Wayne said to Ham Chunk in Danang Air Base was in fact TRUE. Refugees are people who vote with their feet. If you have ever seen the booby traps exhibited in the Cu Chi Tunnels exhibit you will realise that the sometimes simple and warm Vietnamese people can turn very nasty. Just see for yourself the many different leg traps made with rusty 6 inch long nails coated with faeces used to slice up unwary ARVN and US GIs and you will see exactly what I mean. As Ken, a good friend of mine always says, ""Seeing is believing"". If you know people who were in the re-education camps after the fall of Saigon, you won't be so quick to condemn this film. The Communists sytematically starved to death thousand in the re-education camps. my frind had to eat spiders and ants to stay alive.

Today, the intrepid and indomitable Green Berets carry out the same daring mission President JF Kennedy gave them - De Opresso Liber which means to ""liberate the opressed"".

To start with, people, I don't see how a movie that portrays US soldiers in the Vietnam War as war criminals, druggies and trash like PLATOON could be better than ANY other movie on the subject, THE GREEN BERETS included. Would you acclaim a movie negatively stereotyping Afro Americans,Latino or any other minority?No. In this aspect,John Wayne's movie has to be seen as an effort to somehow stem the wave of soldier in Vietnam/Vietnam veteran bashing that corroded this nation to its ever lasting shame at that time.

The experiences,type of missions,tactics,use of eqipment,etc shown in the movie corresponds to what is now considered historical fact. The uniforms and weapons are correct. The NVA VC represented were the NVA VC as armed and uniformed up to 1966/67 so they are either black pajamed or uniformed in khaki not with the NVA green and VC khaki of Main Force units of 67 onwards.

The odd thing to some people is that it was filmed in the US at North Carolina but as someone wrote both North and South Vietnam has many diferent types of vegetation and clime and there were pines and cold places. Not everything was jungle or swamps!

Another thing that results  odd to some is the positive way and the negative way GIs are portrayed vs the negative way communists are portrayed. Well,if you happen to be prejudiced because of politics or just plain bigotry and believe Vietnam veterans were all Lt William Calley clones and every action a My Lai...you need to flash forward to the present and reality because it's a matter of historical fact that pop culture vision is not true.

All politics aside, this was The Duke's from-the-heart tribute to the men and women serving in Nam, who were quite unjustly being blamed for the machinations of the military-industrial complex.
No, the situation was not as straightforward as TGB suggests, but the movie does give you something of a feel for the nature of jungle warfare, such as the cover and point methods of moving through areas that were often laced with booby traps and snipers.
Having had a lecture on VC booby traps from a field engineer from 1 ATF (Phuoc Tuy province) in 1971, (I was not with the military) I couldn't understand how anybody ever survived a month, let alone a tour. This movie goes some way towards showing how effective these devices could be, and how they could even account for 40% of casualties in some units.
TGB wasn't just a piece of shameless flag waving by The Duke, it was an attempt to humanize the War and make people care about the individual soldiers above all, at a time when the Communist hijack of the Peace Movement had made many people shun the returning troops and label them ""baby killers"". Even though it was the VC who were sometimes booby trapping live babies in order to kill American soldiers.
If America feels guilt about VietNam, it should primarily be for the way it abandoned its young men to the Communist-led jackals of the ""don't think, just chant something"" sixties.
The returning troops, whose average age was nineteen (just think of all the eighteen and nineteen year olds you know) heard all manner of hateful derision and ridicule back in the World.

THE GREEN BERETS (which takes many liberties with the superior novel) is Vietnam as it should have been (in the eyes of the pro-war hawks) but in retrospect, it appears to depict some alternate dimension. The conflict is broken down into simple black and white terms. Godly Americans helping their Godly Freedom Loving South Vietnamese defend their freedom against the Evil Atheistic Communist North Vietnamese.
Unfortunately, the anti-war films that followed it also seemed to take place in some alternate dimension. Evil Imperialist Americans deliberately napalm-bombing the Poor Vietnamese Peasants while American Boys got Killed in Large Quantities For Nothing.
Fellow Americans, lets encourage Hollywood to at least once, try and depict the conflict in Indo-China as it really was.",1025308800,30,945,5.47945205479452
285039,4,6300267830,"As others have mentioned, this is perhaps the only pro-war film ever made about our involvement in Vietnam, either at the time of the war or since.
Pretty much these days, nobody espouses a pro-war stance on the Vietnam conflict. It was not a ""good"" war, after all, and the war will always be part and parcel with the agony of America's social chaos in the late 60's and early 70's. However, at the time, the social battle lines were well defined between the peaceniks and the hawks; those against the war, and those all in favor of it. Without the thirty-plus years of hindsight to help them put this conflict in perspective, the hawks were pretty gung-ho. Likewise, the the peaceniks, who thought that if we just ""love each other"" everything would be alright, looks pretty naive and childish. If only the world were so simple.
Like the war, this film engenders strong feelings in those who see it. The DUKE was a known hawk, and you can see it shine through in every line, and in every scene. Like most hawks at the time, I suspect that The DUKE simply thought Vietnam was just like any other war (most likely, World War II), and it was incomprehensible to them that anyone would be against it. The film, in turn, reflects the hawk viewpoint.
In other words, you could substitute the Vietnamese with the Japanese in WWII, and the film would be more or less the same (good, upstanding Americans vs. big bad empire). The capture of the enemy general is pure WWII melodrama. The character of Petersen, the ""scrounger"", is also a stock character from a WWII movie. The staging of the action, the commando raid, blowing up a bridge, etc., all scream WWII.
DUKE co-directs, and despite being filmed in Georgia (which looks nothing like Southeast Asia!), the results are really pretty good. The raid to capture the enemy general is laughable, but tense and exciting nevertheless. The characterizations are solid. The film flows nicely, and isn't too long or too short. The cinematography is workable, and at times, even impressive. There's plenty of action, too!
When you see DUKE react to the child running from helicopter to helicopter looking for Petersen, you cannot help but have respect for this film. Certainly one of the best endings in American film history follows. Politics and anti-war sentiment of today's PC society aside, this is a great war film that honors the best of the best; the Green Berets.
Let me take a moment and say a word or two about David Janssen's role as George Beckworth, the reporter for a left-wing and anti-war newspaper. The character is a little too obvious, and at first, a little too strong on the anti-war sentiment. His conversion was a little too predictable, but the handling of his conversion to pro-war is very well-handled. Ultimately, I think it was a believable transformation, and this is due entirely to Janssen's talent. In the hands of another, less skilled actor, the Beckworth character could have been a big sore point, but Janssen makes Beckworth a quiet force, a wall of anti-war sentiment needing to be erroded away by the reality of the situation he finds himself in. In many ways, I think Janssen's underplayed approach for Beckworth makes him seem more real, and ultimately sells the character. It helps sell the movie too, despite our modern perspective on the war.
Appearing in supporting roles are Jack Soo (Nick Yemana on ""Barney Miller""), George Takei (Sulu on ""Star Trek""), and Bruce Cabot. Cabot had starred in a great many films, and ""The Green Beret"" is one of his last. He was a favorite DUKE co-star, appearing with DUKE in ""Hellfighters"", ""Big Jake"", ""Chisum"", ""The War Wagon"", ""In Harm's Way"", ""McLintock!"", ""Hatari!"", and others. Cabot is probably most famous for rescuing Fay Wray from King Kong. Also on hand is The DUKE's son, Patrick Wayne. Patrick appears as the commander of a Seabee team, following in his father's footsteps (DUKE starred in the famous homage to the outfit, ""The Fighting Seabees"").
DUKE fans should try to locate a copy of the video ""No Substitute For Victory"" (available on this site), in which DUKE hosts a right-wing documentary look at our reasons for fighting in Southeast Asia. Watching this documentary after the film will give the viewer new insights into the thinking of the hawks at the time, and their position during the Vietnam conflict.",1024185600,116,4346,4.811497326203209
285040,5,6300267830,"I found this to be a great movie about the Green Berets and the Special Forces. I find it disturbing that it gets so much bad press cause it didn't have an anti war message or that it didn't portray acurately the war in Viet Nam. First on the anti war message. I think that the scene where they tell David Jansen, the reporter, about how the communist went in and killed all the politicians, the school teachers, women, and children ( which proved to be accurate after what we saw and found out in Cambodia under the communist) and when he found the little girl dead and mutilated is one hell of an anti war message. It also sends a message that even though a soldier despises war that somebody has to stand up and fight for what is right.
I think that people saying that it did not portray the Viet Nam war accurately are misguided. The war that covert ops and the Green Berets fought was much different than an 18 year old green draftee. Most Green Berets were seasoned veterans and non com's. And depending on the time of the war you are portraying (in this film it is very early in Americas part of the conflict) the war was a different war. Not large scale with those same green troups.
Anyway I thought that this movie showed both sides of the conflict and the men stuck in the middle. I thought Jim Huttons performance was very good, as well as Aldo Rays. John Wayne and David Jansen were brilliantly matched as to opposite extremes of a question. This movie is the bridge between the old gung ho type war movie and the anti war movies of the 70's. But no less compelling.",1022976000,11,1579,4.31986531986532

285043,1,6300267830,"I first saw this movie on TV in Australia in 1975. Ironically, the war in question had just ended with victory for the movie's bad guys. But even if we { Australia was involved in this war too } had have won, it still wouldn't detract from just how awful and corny this movie is. The futures of the  cute little Vietnamese orphan, the pretty girl who did the wild thing with the VC colonel ""for her country"", which 7 years later was kaputski, and the unfortunatley named ARVN Colonel Ky would have been very dismal indeed post 1975. I wonder if any of those 3 would have made it to the embassy rooftop before the NVA armour came storming in!. But seriously, it's laughable to say the least. They even had the Vietnamese talking like Sioux ""we build forts,we kill many VC!"" and I just couldn't get over the VC in the staff car in the middle of the jungle,on that beautifully made road. Looked like somebody's driveway in Hawaii {Where were the  Vietnam scenes for this movie shot?] But I do like the song though,pity it came out 25 years too late. Would have been right at home in WW2. But all in all,this movie is dreadful, maybe I'm biased because of the time that I first saw it, and it was  no longer relevant on account of the communist victory, but I don't think it really makes any difference.",1020124800,23,1299,4.359504132231405

After a tour with the 82nd Airborne I joined the reserves and served with a Special Forces unit and met men who lived what this movie portrays. I've read reviews that said that this movie ignored politics and remade WW2 and westerns as a VN movie. What movie did they see? The opening scene alone endured this movie to SF veterans. Actor Aldo Ray (WW2 Frogman vet) tells why the US was in VN and dumps a case of ammo on David Jensen's newsman. This movie attacks politics head on. As far as being a remade western, that was the truth of the war, those camps called ""fort Appache"" or what ever, actually existed. The movie has been called a propoganda film, yet the Special Forces did, as the movie protrays, treat the local population with medical care and the Viet Cong did, as the movie portrays, murder villagers who denied them aid. The movie has cliches but in this case there is truth. One of the problems with this movie is that what made Special Forces in VN so special was still classified and much of the Robin Moore Book that it inspired was outdated for the time the movie portrays. The VC general driving around the jungle in a staff car comes to mind. I call this a great bad movie because there are some unexcuseable flubs in this movie, which one would not expect from a John Wayne major motion picture. Scenes that draw hoots, even from those that love it, are the scene where SGT Provos gets shot in the chest point blank from a 50 Cal and lives long enough to drink a shot with the duke before dying. What trooper wouldn't want to go out like that. The special effects are inferior such as the helicopter crash and some of the pyhrotechs, and let's not forget the poor point man with the plastic metal M16, turns out he didn't need it anyway, as he demonstrated some fine hand to hand moves. Some people complain about the many pine trees in the film, I've never been to VN but I've been to Okinawa and I saw a lot of pine trees there so I'll let that go.
This film shows strong Americans helping the weak and that was the truth. Many laugh that in the final scene the sun sets over the ocean which is on the east coast in VN. That's okay because THEIR BASE WAS ON A SMALL PENINSULIA.",1008115200,46,2270,4.256944444444445

285066,1,6300267830,"John Wayne may always be seen by millions in America as the distilled essence of American patriotism.  In other words, My Country Right Or Wrong.  I'll not dissuade anyone from feeling that way if he or she chooses.
Nevertheless, while the Duke may have had his heart in the right place for making THE GREEN BERETS, he unfortunately let that blind patriotism and his politics get the best of him.  This attempt at stirring up patriotic support for our guys in Vietnam comes across as not merely politically and historically phony but painfully corny.  Wayne likes to think that Vietnam was like World War II--which, of course, was painfully wrong (even more so because he didn't even FIGHT in WW II).  He wants us to believe that the VC and the NVA could be picked off like ducks in a shooting gallery, when that assumption in fact didn't even come close.  And the sentimental scenes involving his dead comrades and a Vietnamese orphan resonate still today, not for how touching they were (because they're not) but because of how utterly sappy they are.
Reportedly, when this film was shown to the troops in Vietnam, many of them either laughed their heads off at Wayne's well-intentioned but utter phoniness or fired their M-16s at the screen.  I've talked to several Vietnam vets who saw the film--none of them, and I do mean NONE OF THEM, thought it was accurate in the least.  Beyond its politics and its historical inaccuracies, it is cinematically phony as well, with the ""sunset in the East"" final shot being the real capper.
Later films like PLATOON and FULL METAL JACKET showed a far more accurate and complex vision of our Vietnam experience as being about young men who were put in a hellhole and were not able to find any way out.  That is what Vietnam was all about, not this simplistic, jingoistic propaganda feast.  THE GREEN BERETS may be watchable for laughs (most of which would be unintentional), but that's all it's watchable for!",996451200,28,1950,4.725663716814159

Although way exageratted, te film shows the humanity, compassion, and humor, that make life worthy in less than worthy situations. ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT it's not. But this film came along at a time of collective national depression, as we began to realize that something was wrong with our involvement in Vietnam. This movie tried to show what little was right. Some of the military scenes are very accurate, the latter ones are not. Mis-identifying common weaponry, turning the solar system upside down, and barely scolding soildiers for sleeping through an attack, certianly didn't help this movie in the credibility area.

285068,3,6300267830,"Although I have seen this picture well over a dozen times and although I think it's basically a good movie, I must be objective and admit that ""The Green Berets"" is basically a propaganda piece that at the time of its filming was an attempt to change public sentiment about our country's involvement in Vietnam.  For this reason, as well as the healing period our country went through after Vietnam, the movie seems rather archaic and naive today.  Those on the far left ridicule it.  Those on the far right treat it with the reverence of a Biblical tale.  The truth about ""The Green Berets"" is that it lies somewhere between these two extremes.
The Fort Benning, Georgia filmed training sequences appear to be as real as anything I ever saw while I was in uniform.  The combat sequences, however, contained a fair share of errors, most notably the well-known ""sun setting in the east"" flub.  The acting was rather wooden, especially from Wayne as well as Jack Soo, portraying the ARVN officer, and the plot meandered from being quite good in some parts to being downright silly in others.
The most important thing to remember about this movie is that it should be taken for what it is...a good war movie.  To casually dismiss it as irrelevant or hopelessly out of step with the truth simply doesn't do it justice.  In similar fashion, it's rather stupid to portray it as an homage to the American way of life and characterize those who point out this picture's many flaws as ""un-American"", as one previous review did.

285070,4,6300267830,"The Green Berets offends a lot of movie critics. Leonard Maltin's comments pretty much sum up the ""right thinking"" attitude toward John Wayne's filmed tribute to the Army's Special Forces. It shows that Wayne got them where it hurt most - he affronted their worldview. This, ultimately, was and is the point Wayne hoped to make.

 Inspired by Robin Moore's superlative nonfiction novel about the Green Berets in Vietnam circa 1964, Wayne didn't set out to make an overly realistic portrayal of the fighting in Vietnam - his purpose was to put to the big screen a sympathetic portrayal of American soldiers and the American effort in Vietnam at a time when the term baby-killer was becoming an all-too-familiar libel pasted on those in the service. Wayne had his own misgivings over how the war was handled at the top level of government, but he noted over the years that the US did make a commitment, and the idea for the film came after a USO tour of the country and chats with soldiers.

 Wayne wanted the film made in Vietnam itself, but could not get permission and thus had to settle for filming it at Fort Benning, Georgia. Wayne and Ray Kellogg strove hard to make the film as believable looking as they could given the constraints they were working under.

 Nitpickers will of course uncover a lot wrong with the film - the overly stylized battle scenes, the stylized and sometimes cliched portrayal of the soldier-characters - notably Jim Hutton's Sgt. Peterson and Also Ray's Sgt. Muldoon. They'll note, as a recent biography of Wayne quite unfairly does, the differences between the events in the film and similar events in Robin Moore's book. But the film has aged much better than the leftist fraudulence of such works as Vietnam: Hearts & Minds and the quasi-surrealism of Apocalypse Now have. This is because Wayne and company made it without any pretense, and because the film's pro-American view of the war is far more accurate an historical gauge given the disasterous events that befell Indochina after the fall of Saigon - as Wayne might have asked, why would anyone want to see the Allies not win in Vietnam?

 As an action film, The Green Berets is quite entertaining, as Wayne assembled an engaging cast including Hutton, Ray, David Janssen in one of his first projects after the completion of The Fugitive television series, Luke Askew - reportedly Askew was a reallife antiwar activist, so how he signed onto this film is a puzzle - Edward Faulkner, Jason Evers, George Takei, and Jack Soo. The action for two-thirds of the film centers around a Forces basecamp that is in the heart of 'Cong territory, and which the NVA assaults and finally destroys only to be slaughtered by an AC-47 gunship. Following this mini-Khe Sanh seige Wayne signs on to lead a mission to kidnap a well known 'Cong general.

 The film ultimately is an action yarn that pops the antiwar left right in the eyes.",976320000,19,2911,4.757936507936508

Here's my story and the stuff I discovered about it: Green Berets was released during the Vietnam War. I never saw this movie, because I was a wanna-be-hip and cool 21 year old. HUGE controversy. What I discovered: the movie's based on Robin (French Connection) Moore's book. Moore was a WW II flyboy-vet and Special Forces fan. BUT when Wayne approached the military for help, they initially balked: they were suing Moore for giving away ""secret"" intel in another book!  To placate the Pentagon, Wayne's production company bought the book but he vowed Moore would have nothing to do with the movie itself. That made the Pentagon happy. Moore was satisfied--Wayne paid him $35,000 cash. Not bad.  The rest is history: movie cost just $8 million to make (military's full support with personnel and equipment.) The movie is released in June--and by the end of the year the box-office was close to 28 million!  According to Wayne, Green Berets was in the black three months after it opened. Wayne's happy ...and Robin Moore is ecstatic: part of the deal was 5% of whatever profit the movie made.  Take that, Pentagon!
