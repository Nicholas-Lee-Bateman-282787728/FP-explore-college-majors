8062191,4,B0009K5R9K,"In this movie a troubled seventeen year old girl, Rachel, runs away from her loser of a mother, or, more specifically, her mother's sexually abusive boyfriends.  At the same time, a dancer is recently released from prison, having (in my opinion) been unjustly convicted.  Having been refused lodging because of her age, Rachel is resting late at night by a highway when the dancer stops to see if she needs help.

Gradually, Rachel grows to respect the dancer, and how she is able to express emotions through modern dance.  So, Rachel becomes a part of the dancer's dance class.  The longer she studies dance, the more she finds that she is able to express in dance what she is apparently unable to express in words.  There are several side stories in this movie, but they all eventually weave together to make the fabric of an engaging movie.

The only two negatives I have about this movie is that Rachel is often seen smoking, and even defending it.  Also, if one is not particularly a fan of modern dance, such as my wife, some of the dance sequences may seem a bit long.  To me, however, Rachel's dance sequences are graceful, creative and even a bit erotic as her lithe, supple body performs the flowing moves.

Another lesser annoyance to me is the silver pin she had stuck between her lips and chin.  Even in spite of that, Clara Furey, as Rachel, is exceptionally radiantly beautiful.  The move is worth watching just to appreciate her physical beauty!  The movies are full of beautiful girls and young women, but Clara is in a class by herself.  [I mention this after having reviewed more than 2,500 movies dealing with children and teens in the last three years.]  It is too bad that this is the only movie she made.  [Clara's mother was a school teacher to turned to acting, and her father was a porn star who 'graduated' to more mainstream movies.  He was nominated for 7 Canadian Genie awards and won two.]

In summary, I would say that most people who are sophisticated enough to watch subtitled movies will find watching this movie an entertaining and satisfying experience.",1193788800,,2090,4.663934426229508
