The episodes have stretched to 12 minutes each compared to the original's 4 minutes, and the jokes are as strong as ever. The extended time frame opens up for additional jokes and deeper storylines, which is always positive. Even though not as fast-paced as the prior show, it still holds up very well. The jokes are true to the series, the music is cheery and the animation are a notch better compared to it. There's a bunch of new songs, as most of the ova specials use different theme songs for both the op and ed, and there's even some cute insert songs that'll get stuck to your brain.

The DVD runs for about 4 hours, so the price is just right for this set. The quality of the episodes are surprisingly high, considering the age of this show. If you enjoy the hand-drawn anime style, before they started using computers to animate, this is a great choice for you. And if you liked the original series, this will be a great addition to your shelf. Just don't expect too many extras, as there's only an introduction to the japanese voice actors present on this set. Would've been great to have some textless op's and ed's..",1397692800,,1231,4.442477876106195
