6607899,4,B00N1JQ0BK,As has been pointed out half the 1200minutes for this set is the Japanese version of the series as far as I can tell the only differences are the title sequence and the audio,1421280000,2,174,4.147058823529412

6607903,5,B00N1JQ0BK,"6 discs and not 8 as described. You can't watch English dubbed with English subs. Only English subs in the Japanese dub. The 1200 minutes in the description likely counts the English dub and the Japanese dub/Eng sub versions as separate episodes. Miyazaki had a hand in helping create this series. It's what caught my interest. I did not grow up watching this although I'm old enough. I believe he helped write and direct the first 6 or so episodes according to something I read online. The show certainly ""feels"" like Miyazaki in some ways. Not just some of the weird steampunk inventions you'd see in Miyazaki's movies...but the way some of the action sequences are handled too. Many of the episodes are self-contained although small events are sometimes referenced in other episodes. My fianc is a big Sherlock fan. Our favorite version is The Grenada version with Jeremy Brett. Sherlock Hound is simpler. It definitely strays from the stories although you can find similar themes loosely interpreted in a few of them. This is a great set that's fun for all ages. My gal says she wishes Mrs. Hudson and Inspector Lestrade felt more like the books as with other Sherlock interpretations but I still enjoyed them. Not really a series to get serious over (I mean...they are all dogs. ha.). It's just lots of fun...and surprisingly really funny in some moments. I can recommend this set to anyone interested in this genre of animation. The series is available to watch in a few spots online (but you'll have to suffer advertising) so you can make sure you like it before adding it to your collection.",1417824000,15,1599,4.776173285198556

8675708,5,B00N1JQ0BK,"Sherlock Hound was one of best anime series. This anime is one my favorites and I haven't seen it until I bought it on DVD by discotek media. It has two versions the original japanese version with English subtitles and the British English dub. This is the only furry cartoon that I love, other furry cartoons such as looney tunes are very idiotic. But this is very amazing and beautiful cartoon with only anthropomorphic cartoon dogs. Interesting to know the voice for Mrs. Hudson was done by Patricia Parris best known for Pammy Panda from Shirt tales.",1455148800,2,553,4.711340206185567
