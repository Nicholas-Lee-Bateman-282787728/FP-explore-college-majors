5346330,1,B009LA1QZS,"What has happened to you, History Channel?  There is no possible way you can distill over 7000 years of the recorded human condition into 6 one-hour ""epic"" episodes.  The only thing epic about this series is its complete lack of historiocity, context, and academic support.  Really?  Brian Williams is used to comment on the ferocity of the Crusades?  What has he written on the subject?  Conversely, the rise of Islam and its campaign to spread its religion is not covered at all.  We are left with only one side of the story.  And I have never heard that he Bible was written during the Jewish exile into Babylon.  But because they have an historian with a foreign accent say so for 35 seconds in one of the epsiodes, then it must be true.  And it wasn't even a Hewbrew historian! I could go on and on, but what's the point. Stay away from this awful swill that tries to pass itself off as a documentory just as you would stay away from scotch on the bottom shelf: it may be cheap, but it will leave you hollow inside.",1354060800,43,1020,4.377659574468085
5346331,2,B009LA1QZS,"This program somehow manages to spend several minutes discussing  the achievements of the sub-Saharan African Kingdoms of Mali, Great Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia without showing any dark-skinned faces. That takes real, concerted effort.",1353974400,14,231,6.21875
5346332,5,B009LA1QZS,"I'm currently watching this series on The History Chanel (just finished the fourth episode) and it's really good. America: The Story of US was great, this is similar but with a much larger scope. The most important moments in world history are resumed quickly in a few minutes and connected over centuries. The production is great, for a documentary. Five stars! I'm really enjoying it.",1353888000,21,386,4.953846153846154
5346333,4,B009LA1QZS,"This first episode does a good job of piecing together early human history in a chronology that logically flows from one event/invention/discovery to another.  It does make some obvious educated guesses, but educated guesses are necessary in history, especially when there are few written records of the time.  This first episode provides a good, quick and summarized illustration of the early events of human life and how we came to be a people from a mere animal species.

The only flaw is that it seems, at times, that the progression of this history moves too fast, without an explanation of other civilizations (such as the Mayans, Aztecs, Chinese). It seems that a lot of things are ignored or bypassed for the sake of making the episode an hour or less.  Do not expect a detailed explanation of human history, but a good and entertaining summary that could precede more detailed research with other sources.",1353110400,11,914,4.915584415584416

This documentary deserves the highest of ratings because it is extremely well done. The pacing and re-enactments are superb and the CGI is top notch compared to anything out there.

5346348,4,B009LA1QZS,"This video series is great for classroom use.  The stories are dramatic and well-narrated.  For the most part, they are historically sound (though there are some errors).  I like that they use professionals as sources as reinforcement during the episodes: generals, ex-soldiers, professors, historians, etc.  Each vignette is not too long or drawn out, and the action is pretty decent.

5346378,1,B009LA1QZS,This is a false depiction of the truth about man kind seen through the eyes of morally corrupt progressives who don't use facts and truth to narrate history. They use the facts and truths they want you to know but leave out key parts to paint pictures about groups they may not like. They are writing history to destroy religions or races they don't agree with. If you ask me they are terrorists of facts and history. It's sad that so many companies that used to be trust worthy like the History channel have sold out to corruption and a false ideology.,1509235200,,553,4.431372549019608

It has some exaggerated claims and History Channel style embellishment, but I love the reenactments. It's hard to find any decent historical reenactment series and these are very fun to watch, if silly at times -- Paul the Apostle doing parkour to escape city guards is a highlight. It only gets four stars, however, because I was upset to discover this Blu-ray has no captions or subtitles! Even Netflix had cranked out some CC for their streamed version. I have both auditory processing issues and noisy friends, so it's more than a slight disappointment.",1487808000,5,670,4.834782608695652

5346410,5,B009LA1QZS,I use several of these episodes in my World History Classes and they are excellent.  There is just enough action and information to keep students engaged and administration happy.

They will focus on really random things for way longer than others in an episode, and skip over things that I felt were way more important or interesting.

5346430,3,B009LA1QZS,"As a woman, I did not like this series because it seems that most of what I saw was about war and killing. Though it is about how man spread across the globe, it focuses almost entirely on the need for food and land, greed, taking from another group of people. There is so much more to mankind and its story than this. However, my 16-year-old grandson, who is being shown this in the 11th grade, says it will appeal to high school students (mostly boys) because of all the action. My son says the music and narrative is cheesy. My husband thinks it's interesting. As for me, I couldn't continue to watch it. Every time I sat down to try, out came more swords and blood.

5346433,3,B009LA1QZS,"I didn't really like the series. The directing leaned heavily on sped up and slowed down scenes, close-ups, and overly dramatic voiceovers. There wasn't anything new to learn, although I suppose this might be useful to someone not familiar with basic history. This style tends to be the typical outline of most documentaries now, to provoke awe, fear, and some other emotion rather than provide interesting historical facts.",1472947200,,424,5.25

Unfortunately for a lot of people, you won't know that evolution is a hoax until Jesus comes again to once and for all establish His kingdom on this earth.
Evolution is a hoax and is only beloved by people who cannot stand someone (the One and Only True God Jesus Christ) telling them how they should live. What these people don't realize is there is liberty through submission. Obedience to Jesus Christ and Him alone is your only saving grace.",1467590400,3,709,4.546875

And the faith they manage to have in our future in spite of the horrors and selfishness of our past has me, a student of History a bit humbled and ashamed for never feeling the same.

Too often educational historical videos are boring, but this one does a good job of maintaining a quick pace, focusing on things teenagers find interesting, and giving a really broad overview of world history. There are some major things they leave out (the Renaissance, for example) and some complicated issues that are very much oversimplified, but I understand that the history of the world is a difficult thing to cover in a few 45-minutes episodes.

They are all subject matter experts on prehistoric human life, at least according to the History Channel. I stopped watching this after seeing Anthony Bourdain in the first episode, so unfortunately I cannot tell you what comes later on in the series. Maybe UFOs?

Meanwhile, the History Channel is headquartered exactly 2.9 miles from New York University and 5.6 miles from Columbia University. All they have to do is walk over and knock on the door of one of the anthropology or history departments. But no, let's see what Anthony Bourdain has to say about life 200,000 years ago.

This is a casual walk through history of mankind. This is not Ken Burns, though even he gets 1 stars so no series is perfect. This is a 12 hour series so not everything can be covered and what is covered can't be gone into great depth. You wan't that, take a history class. Yes some of the people who chime in and say something don't add much, but don't ruin anything either. History channel uses, lets just call them commentators, in several of their series such as America the History of Us and The Men Who Built America to name a few. In fact this series is very similar to those other series in format. So if you enjoy any of those other series you will probably enjoy this and vise versa. Same is true if you don't like it, you probably won't like the other series. Having said all that this enjoyable as it has a feel of a large movie with reenactments and computer animations to visually drive home what is happening. It moves along at a good pace and is far from boring. It may be a casual take on history but so much is covered that you will learn something if you aren't all ready a big history buff. Younger audiences will find this more informative then older people who should know or at least be familiar with most of this but it's still a great review and lets face it, I can't remember everything.

Though entertaining to watch, it is shallow and at times jingoistic. It seems to go with the vein of recent docu-dramas produced by the History channel. The focus is not on depth or accuracy, but to propagate 'popular' views that serve to entertain more than educate.

The only thing I would change about it is the title. Instead of ""mankind"", I would name it ""human kind."" This is a great video for anyone wanting to know the history of humankind.

Pros:
- Entertaining and mostly accurate view of history
- Great insights into the story of China

Cons:
- Needed to focus more on the African continent. There was a lot of emphasis on Europe, Asia and the United States. The video needed to contain more information on Africa and the inventions discovered there.
- There needed to be more details on story of women.",1432512000,,694,4.544

As other commentators mentioned, many of the facts are off and not enough time is given to extremely important events. We are told 7 times that iron was a key invention, mainly I think so they could show battle scenes. Then there is a brief mention of Buddhism and Confucianism, and we are told it is not a coincidence iron rose to prominence at the same time as these religions and as Jesus. Excuse me? What is the connection?  These aren't contemporaries? And isn't there also a large religion called Hinduism? What was happening in other places at this time? I can't imagine the Druids are worth 3 minutes and all of Buddhism, Confucianism and Hinduism less than 4 seconds if one looks at their relative importance in history.",1432166400,4,869,4.717105263157895

5346545,1,B009LA1QZS,"So wrong-headed it really hurts at times to listen to this glossy, paint-by-numbers twisting of human history.  Worse, many of the ""buzz"" phrases used to explain the epochs of man are regurgitated concepts long ago tossed out by historians as just plain wrong.  The whole ""Iron Age"" tent pole idea revisited over and over, is actually, simply untrue.  Iron as the better metal that crushed ""bronze age"" cultures is blatantly false and is nothing more than an historical urban legend.  In fact Roman troops continued to use some bronze weapons well into the Christian era.  The advantages of iron was that iron ore was more readily available in Europe and cheaper to manufacture than bronze.  But truth is bronze was (is) the better metal for casting and longevity... it doesn't rust.  Oddly they repeat (more than a few times) that iron weapons hold their edge better than bronze, is a completely idiotic statement.  In battle warriors kept their swords sharp.  Period.

In the supposedly in depth examination of philosophy and religion, the invention of monotheism is credited to the Hebrews in the middle east, when in fact, monotheism was created much, much earlier by Akhenaton and Nefertiti in Egypt, at about the time the Bible was just being written -- worse, King Gilgamesh and his ""Epoch"" are not even mentioned.  Fragments show it was written over 5,000 years before the Judaic Bible and the more complete version contains the story of Noah, foundation for Genesis and an almost beat-by-beat model for the much later King David.  Gosh, wonder why all that got left out?

Those are just examples.  Bottom line is this series cannot be trusted.  Sure, they don't get everything wrong, but they get a lot wrong which is enough to suggest you should... just turn the thing off.  And read a book instead.",1423440000,14,1809,4.881967213114754

5346619,2,B009LA1QZS,"Much to superficial, misleading (often by omission), and melodramatic. Unlike other reviewers, I don't mind the effort to cover broad ground quickly, but these episodes attempt to do so by shortchanging important social developments while highlighting the less important but more titillating ones. For example, without developing cultures of cooperation across biological lineages and learning to build institutions, civilization never gets off the ground. Religion, government, and other social systems bind societies together and allow large-scale development and accomplishments to occur, such as trade networks, public works, specialization and division of labor (leading to surplus production and technological changes/improvements), etc..Would never show this in a classroom, and shame on those who do. Education today panders too much to expectations to be entertained, and showing these films as ""education"" reinforces the notion. Worse, it hinders information literacy skills, as this film lacks proper argument from evidence and context. For example, why do we have a Hollywood military consultant explaining evolutionary development instead of an archaeologist?  Really does a disservice to the notion of thoughtful, insightful, and reasoned inquiry.",1414972800,7,1261,6.124293785310734
5346620,3,B009LA1QZS,"The series contains great graphics and tonnes of useful dramatized information but it is not always academically accurate. I understand in this style of history telling , the medium of narration is a limiting factor. This means narration can only be in ""mile wide and inch deep ""  mode.  The problem is that at places this series in shallower than an inch and is also inaccurate.

One example one could readily quote where this series gets it wrong is when it says Christopher Columbus was looking for China. He was in fact looking for India. This fact is easily borne out by labeling of native Americans as ""Indians"" by Columbus' party . The editors of the series got even such a well known fact wrong. It was search for black pepper and blocking of  land route to India by Ottoman empire which triggered Columbus's voyage.  For more see the following Times report:

Chili Peppers: Global Warming
By SIMON ROBINSON, June 14, 2007

But this series makes no mention of spice trade with India as the real motivation behind the voyage. If Columbus was actually looking for China , as the series claims, then Columbus would  surely have called native Americans ""Chinese"" , or wouldn't he?

Also, how come  the people shown in dramatization of  Timbuktu all light skinned European looking? This is a city in country of Mali in West Africa with black Muslim majority ! The editors literally ""blacked"" out these people. Couldn't they find models of African descent to dramatize this more authentically?

Please treat this series as popular entertainment version of history. Don't quote it in serious discussions. You will regret if you do.",1414800000,,1632,4.851985559566787

5346624,5,B009LA1QZS,"In the battle of glitz versus substance, this mini-series has both. Capacity to induce boredom is no virtue. Capacity to summarize complicated events is no vice. You could criticize this series for simplifying history and glossing over nuances and controversies. That criticism would miss the point. A summary must address the big picture concisely. This summary uses a telescope to give us the wide context and a microscope to bring the context alive with examples. We watch dramatic portrayals of particular events. Those events symbolize the wider forces of history and trigger cascades of memories for those of us with some broader and deeper knowledge. Three cheers.

As someone else suggested, this miniseries is more stylish than educational. It glides on so many things too fast. However, it's a good refresher and it is really well done in terms of presentation. I wish they would create a series with the same high quality standard for presentation and a more in depth analysis.

5346683,1,B009LA1QZS,"The miniseries started with great potential, but then like nearly all History channels shows, is substituted its own liberal, anti-Christian revisionist history and left out some glaring points.

Nearly 30 minutes was about Christ, but when it came to teaching about Islam, it completely skipped its origins, and the fact that Muhammad was a warlord who married a 6 year old girl.

Some of Islam's contributions to society were notable, but the nonsense really hit the fan when they said that the Pope and the Catholic Church started the Crusade..

It falsely claimed that Christians were the aggressors in the conflict.

This not true by any stretch of the imagination. The Crusades were a direct response to Muslims attacking in the 8th and 9th centuries.

It also falsely claimed that the loss of life during the crusades, was greater than any other in history.

Again, this patently false. Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Stalin, Lenin, Mussolini, Jung-il, all left wing socialist communist governments, have cause the death of over 83 million people since the Bolshevik Revolution.

Actually having a historian reviewing the script would have been a good thing.",1409184000,6,1156,5.117021276595745

5346685,2,B009LA1QZS,"The series has some positive points:
1. Explaining the advancement of cultures through the emergence of important alloys like bronze and steel.
2. Portrayal of the calamity of the Black Death and its relevance to our modern world
3. Why early Christianity made such a huge impact on Roman society.
If only based on that, this series would have merited 5 stars.

HOWEVER, here's where things did go awry:
1. The makers did a very poor job in framing the context of the Crusades. They totally failed to mention that the whole situation started when the Seljuqs conquered the Levant and started to persecute Christians and Jews. Finally, they forbade all Christian pilgrimages to the Holy Land. It was in response to these acts of religious intolerance by the Moslem Seljuqs that sparked the Crusades. This is very poor teaching of history. Poorly taught history is worse than not teaching history at all.
2. The ""military historian"" expert went on to say that ""The Crusades was the most shameful act in human history"". Really? With all due respects, he should stick to the facts and not pontificate on this. Is it more shameful than Nazi Germany and the Holocaust? Is it worse than Stalin's own purge of millions of Soviet and occupied peoples? Or the African slave trade started by the Arabs and continued by European colonial powers? Again, very poor history teaching.

This made the series questionable in its intent at best, and horribly misleading about the relationship among religions at its worst. Two stars for bad history.",1408924800,2,1530,4.903474903474904

5346687,2,B009LA1QZS,"First off, this series is not the story of mankind, it's the story of war.  All else about our history and culture is made subservient to the history of war.  If it's the history of war that you're interested in then the series may have some use.  Second, Christianity is presented as the central key to all of world history, while all other religions are barely even mentioned at all.  All in all, this series is an entertaining myth.

5346692,5,B009LA1QZS,"This would be a great series for history buff families to make Friday night plans around!

What a great ""big picture"" series!!  You're only getting 7-10 minute snipits on any key event, but you're able to get the big picture idea of how everything in history fits together and see those pivotal moments that have truly helped to shape mankind.

Key topics like: agriculture revolution, use of tools and weapons, invention of warfare, rise of empires through great leaders, fall of great leaders through greed, the ""apocalypse"" as seen through the fall of the Roman empire, rise of the Islamic states, rise of the Mongols, rise of the Chinese through gun powder, impact of American civilizations being found (silver!), major trade routes and why they were important, the impact of the plague, where it spread and how it spread, reviving the world after the plague, ship technologies... really good quick connections!!  I also like how this is not all about how Europeans came to be - but that it truly gives a taste of what is happening globally from the Out of Africa movement to the rise of villages and then cities - to how cities fall.

For students who are taking a world history class and having a hard time tying things together, this would be a good preview or review to tap into what they know.  It TOUCHES upon the key technological developments, major trade developments, a few key figures etc.  This by no means would replace a textbook or class, however, it does a great overview of the content from many of the world history units.

I also convinced my husband to watch some of the series with me - he is not really into history - but found it easy to watch and liked the big picture ah ha moments when they made connections as to why and how civilization came to be and has evolved through time.

Mankind comes in a 3 disc series.

Disk 1: Inventors, Iron Men, Empires, Warriors
Disk 2: Plague, Survivors, New World, Treasure
Disk 3: Pioneers, Revolutions, Speed, New Frontiers

5346750,3,B009LA1QZS,"So far in the series (my wife and I are up the Crusades episode) North America has had two very brief cameos. No mention of the Ancestral Puebloans who built the largest multi-story building in the Western Hemisphere until the 1800s, the Cahokia mound-builders, the arrival of the first people through the Bering Land Bridge, the Maya, the Toltec, or the Moche. I'm sure that will change when western Europeans ""discover"" the Americas. Other than this huge omission and the fact that China is only tangentially mentioned it is pretty good.

5346763,4,B009LA1QZS,"What is special about this world history series is that it takes you from the beginning of history to the present including the major events of the timeline with which we are all familiar--but it does not repeat the exact same events and well known historical personages. Instead it highlights important events that helped shape our world as it is and mentions to  us men and women who were important in precipitating those events, but whose names are not the most familiar. We learn some important details not usually referred to unless you are doing scholarly work on a certain era or subject of that era. Some of the facts I am not sure of as the producer might have used the results of different scholars with alternative view points. For instance, the claim that the Incas were mummifying their corpses before the Egyptians. Others think that survivors from wrecked sea vessels landed on South America and gave them Egyptian knowledge. I favor that theory. I think the narrator's voice should have been stronger and when he said the unfamiliar names he should have slowed down and carefully enunciated them, perhaps they could have been displayed. Some names he pronounced quickly and a bit too softly, such as those in Arabic and Chinese, and I could not hear them. However, the imagery and acting out of the events as they were narrated was excellent.",1398038400,,1358,4.803418803418803

5346778,3,B009LA1QZS,"The history of humankind is long and complicated. This documentary does a fair job of giving an overview of human history as written and viewed by the victors. Women are almost entirely left out of this story as the emphasis is mostly on wars and skirmishes over land, religion, and resources, so perhaps the title is apt. All in all this series has made me curious about several issues, and put a lot of hard to manage information and alternate narratives into a manageable and conceivable timeline.

5346790,1,B009LA1QZS,"People Magazine's version of history.  Very biased, cherry-picked historical events.  I stopped watching after episode four (Warriors) where Christians were constantly being cast as the bad guys (no, I'm not Christian). The political correctness and the smugness of Brian Williams were just too much to for me to handle.

True, the Christian Crusader's did nasty things to Muslims in Jerusalem, but Islam is given a pass for all the atrocities committed in the name of Allah.  While Arab scholars were given due respect for preserving the scholarly works of ancient Greece, we're reminded a number of times they were also Muslim. Gee, do you think they actually had a choice to be anything else in the Islamic culture of that era? I seem to recall that non-believers were hardly held in the highest respect.

The reference to the Muslim inventor/ polymath Ibn Firmas of Cordoba as being the first man to fly was laughable!  The story was blown way out of proportion for the sake of claiming that a Muslim was the first man to fly.  While many of Firmas's inventions and studies are well-documented, the ""first-man-to-fly"" story was attributed to only one questionable source who wrote about it some seven centuries after the event supposedly happened. This was more legendary than factual.

I tried to find more information but there's not much out there beyond a Wikipedia article. There's far more material on numerous other Arab scholars of that period, so why did the producers decide to allocated precious broadcast time (not to mention production costs) showing something that most likely never happened?  Ibn Firmas was very smart, accomplished and did a lot of cool stuff. I'd think sixty seconds of broadcast time could have been better spent showing just one of his REAL accomplishments rather than some fictional sop claiming that a Muslim was the first man to fly.

On a different subject: when Christ was bound to the cross, the nails were NOT driven through the the palms of his hands, they were driven through the wrist just behind the point where the Ulna and Radius bones connect; this comes from numerous historical accounts depicting how Roman soldiers performed crucifixion on criminals. Once again, it costs a lot of money to set up a scene depicting the crucifixion of Christ complete with all the gore. You'd think they would have done just a little bit of research since the nail-through-the-hand scene was shown several times.

Other rants:

Enough with all the staged battles performed by professional historical re-enactors, different costumes, same stuff.

The real-time graphics depicting the flow of trade & movement of people across Europe, Middle East and China were one of the few redeeming factors of the series.  Gives the viewer the impression that ancient times weren't as primitive as we're all to often  given to believe. Free market capitalism ruled even three thousand years ago!

Brolin's monolog seemed dull and mono-toned. Every line was delivered exactly the same way, it was like he was on an outdoor stage doing Shakespeare rather than adopting a calmer more conversational tone to his delivery.  Of course, this program was originally shown with commercial breaks with one episode per week. Probably not so noticeable under those conditions.",1396137600,11,3289,5.072356215213358

As a teacher of world history for 33 years, I question some of the conclusions they have made (such as their assertion that the Jewish faith was begun in the Babylonian captivity). Two, they seem to skip around some events that I would consider far more important in Man's story, or ignore events that had a great impact on the development of history.",1395446400,,472,4.541176470588235

The only think keeping me from giving this 5 stars is my husband and I noticed a few places where the information on older civilizations was out of date from the current accepted understanding. Also they tend to downplay the brutality of civilizations still in existence.

The actors and the settings, the period costumes, the battle scenes, the ships, each focus is EXTREMELY well done, because this has made this series BELIEVABLE, in other words, has brought the past to LIFE. We see the pain on the reinactors faces who reflected terror, fear, nastiness or whatever the emotion was of the charactor being portrayed, along with period reconstructed weapons.

There were dark periods in history where the picture in the film takes darker tones. And then the tones get visually brighter with the change in subject. The colors are brilliant.
The problem is it misses detail, and the information in it is a little dated. Okay, it is history, so the information has to be old, right? Not really. Today we know a lot more- say,about how the Roman civilization disintegrated. This film does not go into the challenging task of educating us. It is more about look and feel.
I think it could would have done more justice to the movie-makers' technological prowess by adding more detail and cutting out many of the speakers. I thought most speakers had little to add other than express an emotion.
Overall, quite watchable. But I think they could have done a lot more with it- the topic and the technology.",1394841600,,941,4.607142857142857

The treatment of 5000 years of Egyptian history with solely focussing on the reign of Tutmoses' expansion of the empire defies logic, the argument that the Roman legacy to history was Christianity (vice say a legal system or an infrastructure network that survives today), all coupled with a completely haphazard editing style that bounces between historical periods with little regard for what is conventionally accepted as cause and effect left me dizzy, tired, and just uninterested in seeing more of this poorly designed series.",1394409600,17,821,5.47244094488189

We paused it several times during the first episode to have thoughtful chats about what it must have been like at the time, how these changes affected our development as a species and/or of civilization, and how it could have gone differently.

If you want to learn about the development of Mankind, read or watch ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"". The Mankind series is more focused on entertaining you, which is why they have the guys from Deadliest Warrior (Richard ""Mack"" Machowicz feeds on the drama) as the ""experts"". I grew up watching the history channel when they produced shows without all of the over the top drama.",1393804800,11,623,4.724770642201835

However, far too much of the content is about weapons, warriors, and wars and scenes of battle and gore.

5346849,1,B009LA1QZS,"I love the history channel and many of the shows. I was so disappointed in this. This is the story of mankind from a man's perspective. It is not the story of us all. Women were there and too. Women were inventors and had to engage in warfare along with men. I was so sad to see the importance of the other half of the species minimized. Research in the past few years focuses on the importance of all HUMANKIND in the survival of our species. Tons of research support the concept that women were providers, protectors, and inventors! Shame on the history channel for effectively erasing women and their role from history yet again. I love the effort put into this series but, let's avoid omitting half the human race from history. Our children need educated about the history of both halves of our species. How about a story about Womankind. The rest of the story of our species!",1393459200,4,880,4.50625

5346851,2,B009LA1QZS,"When you name your series Mankind, the story of all of us, folks tend to expect something on a scale a bit higher than the average documentary show. I was expecting something like History Channel's other show, The Universe. Multiple seasons, with each episode giving some cool details about the subject they chose. Throw in some smart and funny commentary by professionals that know what they're talking about, and you have a winner. The first episode of Mankind glosses over thousands of years of history way too fast. In an episode that runs about 45 minutes they start at humans walking upright, all the way to the beginning of the iron Age! Not sure how many seasons they expect at that pace. The side bar presenters were a kind of boring lot, with the chosen subject always accompanied by a (not so well done) reenactment.

There are times where they focus too long on something that really doesn't need it, just for the sake of another (frankly kinda cheesy) reenactment. For example: During the bronze age tin was about as valuable as gold, and they tell us as much. This sets up a graphic showing how trade flows during the time, which leads to a setup for some actors to be a merchant family. During the whole 10 minutes of acting out a bandit raid, the worry of the father, the happy conclusion, there was actually something interesting revealed: This family was based on a real one. They left behind some of the oldest writing ever discovered, because the clay tablets they used as journals survived. THAT was interesting and fun  to know! Okay now show me the museum pics of these tablets, or even the dig site, while the sidebar narrator tells me who, when, and where they were found. Nope! The narrator drops this info in the space of about a minute, almost as an afterthought, then onward with the pretend caravan. Tin was super valuable and people would kill for it, right? So how about we see how they get it out of the ground? Any clever tools or techniques that will surprise me? No time for that because we're setting up the next reenactment, this time with chariots!

All of this and it's only episode #1. History channel usually does better. I will give my time to one more, and will happily amend my review if it earns more than 2 stars. If you enjoy it then more power to you.",1393459200,2,2300,4.537349397590361
5346852,1,B009LA1QZS,I'm very disappointed in the History Channel. This series was not well balanced it tried to be overly dramatic. In every episode there was something described as the greatest turning point in human history. How can you have that many greatest turning points? American and European history was stressed with a little bit about the rest of the world. I'm not sure I can trust a series that spent 30 minutes on the American Revolution and then say by the way there was also a revolution in France.,1393459200,14,494,4.625

What happened to the beginning of mankind...when we actually struggled to survive against the world?  While informative it seems to lack a lot of essential parts to mankind's history.  I felt it worked harder on entertaining the audience...which I realize is what we do in modern times just to get people's attention.,1393113600,,423,4.833333333333333

5346867,2,B009LA1QZS,"I would like to give this series more stars just for production value, but unfortunately I can't escape the feeling that it is pushing an agenda.  History has no business spinning the truth in this day and age.

This series consistently presents each and every stone humanity stepped upon in order to reach the modern age as some kind of pavement on the road to glorious and wonderful war.

The narrator can't seem to go more than five sentences without plugging the ""Hardship makes us stronger, the weak are born to die, kill or be killed, war is man's legacy"" line.

Facts are presented, but the visuals they are presented with (such as the flashes of warfare through out the ages during the spear hunting scene) along with the context around those facts paint an inaccurate picture of who we really are.

Add that to the fact that the only people they where able to get for the ""consultation"" spots are news anchors and reality T.V. personality's and you end up with a big old pile of conservative rhetoric and disappointment.

Mankind's every advancement has in fact been an attempt to AVOID some hardship.  Every invention, every new idea, even to this day has been brought to fruition for the purpose of making something EASIER.  So we can be LAZIER

If the agenda this series is trying to push where true, we would have all met up in a god forsaken desert and beat each others brains out so we could ""get stronger"" twenty thousand years ago.

If you're going to watch this, watch out.",1392940800,4,1491,4.592452830188679
5346868,2,B009LA1QZS,"I chose this because while the shows do show history, a lot of it is misrepresented. Columbus was a sex slaver pimp, the reason piracy was so rampant was to steal cochineal red dye from the Americas.

5346880,4,B009LA1QZS,"An example of one of the inaccuracies, fleas are indeed carriers of Y. pestis, but the flea serves merely as a vector for transmission. It does not occur naturally in flea populations, but when fleas bite infected hosts, the Y. pestis triggers starvation in the vector, causing the bacterial transmission. It generally begins as a sylvatic plague, meaning the infection begins in rodent populations and crosses species by way of the flea. A small mistake, perhaps, but it damages the voracity of the claims. There is also the matter of flat-Earth theory, which was debunked B.C.E., and the idea that Newtonian physics was the first iteration for the theory of gravitational pull. Otherwise, the history is mostly correct. Brolin's narration is effective and he excels in name pronunciation, a common area where other narrators fail. This is a good source for introductions to lesser-known historical figures and often overlooked pivotal events in human history.

Interrupting the story are interviews with various people, some of who are totally random sources (TV hosts, etc.) that have no knowledge of the science behind the story...probably just read their lines and that was enough for them.  The interruptions are quite annoying.  There is quite a bit of violence...actually most of the footage I've watched so far is of people killing each other.  I realize our early history had bloodshed but I believe it should have been in the background and not in the foreground.  I wanted my 9-year-old daughter to watch it with me but made her leave because of the bloody scenes of men slicing throats and stabbing each other with blood flying everywhere.

Research who is telling the story, who financed and produced this ""disgrace"" in order to understand how why the lens is a foul propaganda.  A South African historical consultant (their only listed historical consultant) omitting Cecil Rhodes and Diamonds in the episode, ""Treasure""?  One wouldn't think this possible...

5346897,4,B009LA1QZS,"This show is about as comprehensive of known history as you can get.  Granted, the later years are more from an American perspective, but since history is eclipsed by the empires who contributed the most during their times, America does deserve the same respect for the 20th Century as does Egypt, Greece, Persia, Rome etc during their respective times and height of power.  This does cover some non-western civilizations, but more in a western civilization view.

The reason I give this 4 stars is because of the shipping.  As a prime customer, I expect 2 day shipping.  Living in Seattle, sometimes I am graced with rapid shipping, sometimes within 1 business day, especially when the shipment originates from here.  However in this case, the package originated in Seattle and then took a trip down to Portland.  Last week I had a California shipment go out to Kentucky the day before it was to be delivered to Washington state.  How this seems economical, or efficient, I can't bring myself to understand.  Now my Blu-ray order is going to burn up over 350 miles (to and fro) just to travel 15 miles!  On top of the 1000 miles between Washington and California vs the 5000 miles when you throw in Kentucky!

Stir. Garnish with mummy opening it's eyes, because heck why not! Sprinkle of actual facts and history on the side.

You get Mankind: The Story of All of Us.

This is a documentary aimed squarely at the American public audience, 15-25 year old's. This is the History Channel at it's most sensational, most OTT, most vivid, and most Hollywoodized. Mankind clearly has things going for it. The reenactments are absolutely stunning and very ambitious. The costumes are rich, the colours are vivid, the actors are competent, and it makes for great, action-packed watching. The battle scenes are stunning, and the CGI is undoubtedly grand and epic. Visually, Mankind does not disappoint; grand, epic, and often incredibly beautiful.

But it's amazing how little darn history there ACTUALLY is. Rock-hard facts are minimal and dates are almost non-existent. Civilizations, emperors, kings, gods, and peoples come and go in the blink of an eye. Everything is an action scene, and Josh Brolin is certainly anything but subtle. This is more Hollywood entertainment, NOT history, and I ask teachers and parents to refrain from showing this AS actual history in a school or classroom or anything. It is impossible to cover mankind's thousands of years of existence in a mere 10 hours.

The interviewees are even worse, chosen strictly for what cool things they could say and how vividly they could say it rather than on credentials or even knowledge. There's a young writer (on a HISTORY channel?) who insists he knows all about hunger: ""you will spend 4 hours talking with your friends about your next meal"", cold: ""extreme cold is like an animal"", and cannibalism: ""when you get really hungry, you will eat your friends"", he says, like he has been there and done that. There's a marine who never blinks: ""Tools make me better. Weapons make me stronger"", and ""When you see guys rushing to take your land that you worked so hard on, you think, I don't want that to happen. I will stop you."" Yes, yes, there's a smattering of professors and history teachers, but on the majority any facts they gave were a major disappointment.

It was like any knowledge in the series was unintentional and an afterthought to the (admittedly very good) reenactments.

Mankind: The Story of (Almost) All of Us is meant to be entertainment, and it IS entertaining. It's cool watching the first wolf get domesticated or the pyramids built. The cinematography is often very beautiful, and the costumes are, for the most part, period accurate. Visually, the series is absolutely stunning, and you can hold me to that statement. But cerebrally? Non-existent. Your children will learn more about history by reading books and looking at maps and watching BBC (the only channel to make their documentaries entertaining and informative) documentaries than by watching this. For the history buff (like me), Mankind can be simpleminded, but it's undoubtedly a splendid feast for the eyes.

Where is the kindness found in this twisted dramatization of the most abusive and cruel acts performed by non-humans of his-story. I can see how the kids love it - every bit of gore and viciousness Hollywood has brainwashed them into expecting. Glorifying the basest, most beastly of non-human characteristics, as the repeated storyline tries to program us to believe, is clearly untrue and NOT ""The Story Of All Of Us!"" History teachers need to rebel against this kind of perverse and depraved claptrap as a representation of who we are.

If you have ever held a newborn then you know why we are called ""Human-KIND!"" So far actual Human Life has been left out of this insane view of life altogether. We will see in future episodes if any Human-Kind shows up at all. History teachers, if you want to teach your students a story of real Human Life show them, ""Amish Grace"" and teach them how actual Humans act, what is possible for them as True Humans. Show them, ""Joyeux Noel,"" ""42"" or ""Orphans"" if you want to inspire them to function as Humans.",1366156800,6,1128,4.64

5346954,5,B009LA1QZS,Great work from the History Channel here. I managed to watch a few episodes of Mankind on television and I enjoyed what I saw very much. So when I noticed the bluray available in the local store I had to buy it. This is an excellent purchase that has a lot of very entertaining episodes spanning the time from the beginning of history. If the History Channel would spend more time on products like this instead of garbage like Ice Truckers they'd be an A+ organization again.,1362873600,,475,4.471264367816092

5346958,1,B009LA1QZS,"According to the History Channel, the story of human progress was written almost completely by men, usually white men.  The title itself is revealing: ""Mankind"" instead of ""Humankind.""  Women are seen only as tokens, and people of color are scarcely seen at all.  The ""story"" itself is fragmented, concentrating on randomly selected inventions that are hyped up by scenes of fighting and bloodshed.  The first part, discussing ancient tools, was quite interesting, but it went downhill from there.  Such a disappointment.",1362268800,11,521,5.382716049382716

5346963,3,B009LA1QZS,"This video is okay.  The ""history"" channel often distorts or twists information to suit their needs, so you CANNOT just stick this in the DVD player for your students because you decided to be lazy and not preview it.  Always do your research; if your gut says it's an odd statement, it's probably not true.  PBS is for accuracy, this is more exaggerated to engage.  My favorite episodes so far are as follows: the first one, since documentaries on the Paleolithic Age and Neolithic revolution are few, far between, and generally poorly done.  This one was a nice (please note: nice, not perfect) review for the kids at the end of the semester of ideas from earlier, going into finals season.  I also liked the first half of the episode ""Treasure.""

One thing I really DON'T like about this is that the chapter headings often don't correspond with the main idea of that section.  In addition, the beginnings of topics are often in the middle of one chapter, and then span over 1-2 minutes into the next section, so I have to frequently fast forward/rewind between DVD chapters, instead of being able to select the chapter heading that goes along with the topic I'm trying to illustrate.  This was especially annoying in the episode ""Revolutions.""

The other complaint I have, which contributes to this being a poor source of educational material, is that the creators are trying to be ""new"" by often pulling out really obscure people and making them seem more relevant than they actually were.  Therefore, they skip events and people that I feel are common knowledge and instead introduce people whose contributions feel made up or exaggerated.  Examples of this would be the one woman who they claim started the Neolithic Revolution, the odd way they exaggerated the Native American groups in Massachusetts (while simultaneously undervaluing them--an interesting feat) but skipped the earlier Virginia settlement, and focused on diseases by exaggerating the heroic actions of ""doctors"" that no one's heard of, but skipped most political leaders.",1361664000,6,2046,5.002949852507375

5346973,4,B009LA1QZS,"I read several of the reviews and saw much of the series before purchase.  In context I understand some of the criticism of hyped history, however some of that criticism does come off as a bit elitist and pedantic.  I liken it to advising one not to visit South Africa unless they have at least 2 years to properly absorb the culture and nuances of the history.  The series is a thumbnail sketch and may well ignite interest to delve further into certain subject matter.

The producers needed to capture a balance between plodding historical advance and entertainment.  It is not per se a pure documentary and as such, living in the luxury of no need of commercial success.  The question is simple;  is the viewer better served with or without this material being available.  I believe on the whole it is a positive production even with its light approach.  We'll call it the Kenny G of jazz.  Perhaps one will eventually find Coltrane once set upon the path.

Like the women with the grain, the chief engineer from Egypt,the grandson of Genghis Kahn, the family in Sienna italy, the Roman who conquered Britian, all had a role in changing our lives.

How Rome still has the water supply and how Paul used the roman road system is another fact of history that was never covered in class.

This series may be alright if you are trying to give a freshman football team or the attention deficit disorder support group of the local state prison inmates an interest in history.  This series focuses first on special effects, second on making sure that every culture has been given equal importance, third on special effects, forth on testosterone, fifth on special effects.  Oh, I forgot we need a plot - let's talk about the history of all mankind in a few hours.  But, most history is boring, so let's handpick a few special, cool, topics that allow us to show off our special effects.  It won't have much substance or coherency, it will spend most of the time on arbitrary, cherry picked topics, with questionable signifigance; but it will be macho, have a great soundtrack and have incredible special effects!

If you're looking for something ground breaking, no.  History channel has moved in the direction of broad sweeping, world changing documentaries that skip so many details.  I miss the days where these things were really educational, but they're still fun.  Further though, and what really bothers me, is the fact that every time there would be a commercial break, the show spends like 5 minutes rehashing what it had discussed before the commercial break... so essentially you get 5 minutes of repeat stuff, followed by 5 minutes of new stuff followed by 5 minutes of repeat stuff and that cycle goes on and on... basically a 45 minute episode is like 20 minutes of rehashing itself with flowery new words.

It's entertaining and fascinating when it dives into detailed story about a particular character in history, many times you have not heard of. However, it moves way too fast, skimming over important parts of history to focus on these detailed, sometimes trivial stories so it comes off a bit random and all over the place.

Additionally, I would not recommend this for children. I am a grown adult and some of the imagery (especially of the death of women in some of the early episodes) haunted me long after I watched the show and I found myself having to turn away at parts.

5347015,4,B009LA1QZS,"I was critical of History Channel documentaries after the America Story of Us debacle, but after watching the The Men Who Built America, I was eager to watch this documentary. (I was to write a review of TMWBA, but I'm not too familiar with the Gilded Age, and would feel uncomfortable doing so....)

I wasn't particularly pleased with the first episode, but still continued to watch. Once it reached the episode of Mehmet the Conqueror and Cortes, I was disappointed with the series. I thought it would get better by the time it reached the end, and it did, in certain aspects (regarding Cook and Banks), but was a huge letdown.

Of course, you can't cover the entire history of mankind in the time allotted, I wouldn't expect it. That doesn't mean there couldn't have been better parts mentioned, or some omitted. It's just the presentation left too many unanswered questions for the layman. For example, the ancestral ancestor of man having dark skin, then not explaining how dark skin changed to lighter skin in different regions (Eurasia, etc.) Finding the answer to these will involve reading about molecular anthropology and the study of genetics (subjects the overwhelming majority of the viewers will have no knowledge in) and discussions of that magnitude will become too technical and 'boring' for most of the viewers, as it will involve the study on mitochondrial DNA sequences, haplogroups, and will involve studying certain groups of people such as the Negritos in South/Southeast Asia, and so forth. Considering the majority of this information will be in peer reviews that will cost around 40.00 just to review for 5 days or so, this will leave the general public with unanswered questions. There are books, but I'm more familiar with the peer reviews than books, and not as well-read in these subjects than history. Another example was the writing of the Hebrew Bible. I don't think many people know that it's believed by scholars that the majority of what is known as the Old Testament was written during the Babylonian captivity in the mid 6th century BCE. And that the first five books of the OT (Genesis-Deuteronomy) were written a few centuries before, around the 10th or 9th century BCE. Since the general public are more than likely not to be familiar with this, someone could be left asking 'How did they (academics) come to that conclusion?' It should inspire research, instead, it might perpetuate misunderstanding and some definite tongue-lashing from Jews and Christians alike.

One notable glaring omission was that of Alexander the Great. No mention of his conquests that led to contacting with India, and the mentioning of the Mauryan dynasty and the Indo-Greek kingdoms that existed afterwards shouldn't have been overlooked in this segment, especially if there was discussions concerning ancient societies coming into contact with one another, which was a recurring theme. It's rather obvious the producers were going for more familiar topics of popular culture and tried to relate them to the masses (300 and the Gladiator films), and instead could have mentioned more of South Asia (India) and it's contribution in the Silk Road. I would've have preferred the gladiator segment to be omitted entirely.

The coverage of both Christianity and Islam was conflicting. There is a reverend speaking of Jesus and his crucifixion, and in spite of no mention of Jesus' resurrection, the reverend was still there discussing of it. Was he hoping to be a beacon of light for the Christian faith? If I were him, I would have never signed up, since the information given in this program is different than his faith. It also includes events mentioned in the Bible (such as the person helping Jesus while he was carrying the cross) as historical fact. The only two events academics take as fact in unison is his baptism by John the Baptist and his crucifixion. What's the deal with mixing religious belief different from what's accepted as fact? Either tell one story or the other, not a mixture of both. It seemed to be fair of mentioning of Saints Paul and Perpetua concerning the spread of Christianity, but Constantine made provisions in favor of Christianity since the Edict of Milan in 313, and Christianity wasn't even made the state religion of the Roman Empire until 380, over 40 years after his death, not right before he died. The presentation of that in this program is misleading. As for Islam, the presentation seems to be showing Islam and its followers in a favorable light, becoming practically apologetic. I knew about the mentioning of the first known person to attempt flight, ibn Fadlan, and ibn Battuta, but no discussion of the Arab conquests except for a sentence was ridiculous. Also no mention of the Reconquista when mentioning of the Jews, Muslims, and Christians living together in 'harmony'. It was a mixture of tolerance and violence throughout the Reconquista. And whoever was in power in the Iberian peninsula during this era, generally the adherents to religion that wasn't in power were treated as second-class citizens. That's not to say there wasn't any peaceful interactions, as their were instances of Islamic and Christians fighting together, such as El Cid being a mercenary for Muslim and Christian armies after the death of Sancho II and Afonso VI came into power (both monarchs of Leon and Castile). I believe a person is better off reading about the history of Islamic interaction from reputable sources, and not from some of these anti-Islamic books, as they are no better than presentations such as these. Just because there a number of people who are Islamophobes in this country doesn't mean you show everything that Muslims did in history in a favorable notion and omit events that an anti-Islamist will criticize, since they already have their minds made up to begin with. It's the polar opposite.

Another error in fact was that one commentator stated that before Mehmet, no one could get through the Walls of Constantinople. The Fourth Crusade that involved the sacking of Rome by the Crusaders and Venetians in 1204 contradicts that statement, as in fact the Eastern Roman Empire never fully recovered after the Fourth Crusade, and the Byzantine Empire was nothing more than a city-state (Constantinople) by 1453.

Another aspect of Iberian history that was wrong was that of the Granada Wars. It's historical revisionism in one of the worst ways, as they were trying to tie it in with the Zhu Yuanzhang, the Hongwu Emperor (who I was glad they mentioned). China was using gunpowder in war since the Song Dynasty in the 12th Century to begin with, as it didn't start with Zhu. And the arquebus was in use decades in Europe before the Granada Wars (Hungary and Milan, at least), but this can be misleading and lead people to belived that the Aragonese and Castilians were the first Europeans to use it. The coverage of Cortes also wasn't true. He did not conquer the Aztecs with just 500 men. He had a huge amount of assistance (tens of thousands, possibly over one hundred thousand indigenous soldiers/allies) from the tributaries of the Aztecs such as the Tlaxcallan. It is true that the smallpox outbreak did deplete the sources, Cortes didn't walk into Tenochitlan without a fight after La Noche Triste as it is portrayed here, and no mentioning of those tributaries in their assistance is another distortion of historical fact.

Some other issues regarding the information was the lack of blacks in the Mali Empire (I'm certainly no Afro-Centric, but only seeing one or two blacks in the Mali Empire can be misleading, there was a more of a blend of North Africans and Sub-saharan blacks if I'm not mistaken). I was personally hoping of the mention of Musa I, but that's a minor quibble. Also, not mentioning the Kilwa Sultanate and trade in the Indian Ocean. There were Arabic and traders from India that made contact with the Swahili coast in the 10th to the 13th centuries at least, and the Silk Road was more than trekking through land, as there was also sea routes.

I also wish there was more discussion of the Persians, India prior to Shah Jahan and the building of the Taj Mahal, More of the Eastern Roman Empire/Byzantines (Why mention the significance of Constantinople without mentioning its history), Japan before the atomic bombings, Zheng He, just to mention a few. They even could have tied in how after the fall of Constantinople, countries tried to view themselves as the 'Third Rome' as part of the legacy of the Roman Empire. For example, Mehmet called himself the 'Kayser-i-Rum' after the conquest, the Russians (who made contact with the Byzantines during the 10th century, the Rus ruler Vladimir married a Byzantine Princess, and the Varangian Guard of the Byzantines even had Vikings from Rus') also viewed themselves as the legitimate successors (The coat and arms of Russia have the double-headed eagle that was the emblem for the Byzantine Empire). It may seem trivial, and it wouldn't have worked without more discussion of the Byzantines. I also wish other religions were mentioned. Just because Christianity and Islam have the most adherents of any other religion, doesn't mean those two should be the only ones mentioned. This is the History of Mankind, after all. If they took time to mention the Easter Island heads being made, they could have done something about that.

I also noticed that the some of presentation after the mentioning of ibn Battuta didn't match up chronologically, and utterly confused me. From the Incas, Mehmet the Conqueror, Bartolomeo Dias and Columbus, and the mentioning of the Tulipmania just to state a few. To a person who know little to nothing of this, this could be misleading if they were to research on this. And also, the commentators. Wasn't nearly as bad as America: The Story of.... version of this documentary, but Brian Williams and James Miegs speaking about these issues, among others, weren't enlightening. And the amount of actual historians on here were overshadowed by 'military experts', writers, and celebrities, which was appalling. Some of the people mentioned here were out of place (Dr. Oz talking about the Mehmet just because they have the same name?) Even one of the military experts was speaking of the how the people of the Civil Rights movement felt. He was unqualified to speak of that issue, but considering he was speaking of the similarities of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity almost as if they were Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches when the First Crusades were mentioning, it's not a surprise. There's another instance I remember when James Meigs was stating of the people who drew the cave paintings, those people were saying 'I lived.' No it wasn't, all it was depicting what they saw. Or when the section of the Incas was mentioned, one of the commentators said it takes guts and willpower to win battles. This is not informing at all!

However, I did like learning about some of the people mentioned, and seeing certain people mentioned that I wanted to see (ibn Battuta, Zhu Yuangzhang, Queen Njinga, The history of discovering the uses of electricity, Cook and Banks, the Industrial Revolution, etc.), but I certainly won't take what was presented here as fact until whenever I feel like furthering my knowledge in one of these events by means of reading.

I believe I've seen someone state something of this concerning The Story of All of Us documentaries on a review, but not on this site. This is a superficial documentary made for those who are only superficially interested in history. There's some definite truth to that. But this may inspire people to want to read more about it. But considering it's safe to say that the target audience watching this won't look into history unless it's action-packed imagery on a television screen, people will have numerous misconceptions on how the academics may think on these matters covered. This definitely isn't the best documentary that could have been done, and the BBC or PBS would have been much better off attempting something like this that the History Channel, or even NGC and Discovery for that matter. Also considering that people have taken 'historical documentaries' like The Story of All of Us as a subjective like such as a favorite art or music and not a objective one as fact means that the THC has failed again.

EDIT: I personally don't like how I responded in this review. I wish I could have retracted some of these thoughts earlier, but I can't, and I rather let it stand as is to show where I came from as a reminder of how not to write a review. This video can be a great primer for people to want for people to acquire further knowledge. What can be problematic is that some people may not care to do much research after looking at this documentary (or any in general), and that the History Channel didn't do a good job of hiring people who could have better described the subjects that were being covered overall. With that being said, they covered a lot of material over the years, and there can be plenty for people to look into. I was being far too meticulous, and almost condescending with this review. I do still have problems with some of the facts that were shown, or not gone over in further detail, but you cannot expect a Britannica/World Book Encyclopedia with this sort of material. This documentary is fine for what it can do, people just need to be tentative and be open to further research afterwards and not expect to get everything you need to know about the certain people from this documentary. I believe that I had unrealistic expectations for this series, and it showed. My apologies for coming off inappropriately if I had done so.",1356825600,5,13720,4.8963440860215055

5347017,3,B009LA1QZS,"We own the series about America that preceded this series, and really enjoy it and have watched it multiple times. So we purchased this one, thinking it'd be something really great as well. Not so much. I enjoyed half of it, shedding light on some of the less known historical happenings - things I didn't learn about in my history classes in school. However, I found some of the historical data to be somewhat skewed. For starters, if you are a Christian and believe in Creationism, and that according to the bible's timeline the earth is only just over 6,000 years old, then you will find a lot of the timelines in this movie to be way off. They present the typical scientific timeline of millions/billions of years old. Also, again pertaining to Creationism, you may find the idea of gold and other fine metals slamming into and exploding into the earth by pure chance, very laughable, and take that part of the movie with a grain of salt also. There is also a snarky tone with some of the data pertaining to Christianity - calling Christ someone who was disturbing the peace, Peter is referred to in a condescending way as well, the crusades & salem witch trials (while both were definitely horrible and should not have happened) are over played and drastically shamed, while islamic acts of terror are barely touched on and greatly glazed over. I also found the theory of all life beginning in Africa questionable, since many professionals have said that there is no real way to calculate where mankind began on this Earth, due to such drastic changes in landscaping over the years (so finding it according to biblical clues are even vastly remote). I was also very let down that they ended the movie in the 1960s. They show images of man going to the moon, but that is as the movie is ending. They never elaborate on it or give any facts about it. And beyond that, nothing. The movie simply ends. I realize that most people born in the 1960s are still alive and have lived through our most recent history, but it still seemed like the movie was ended on a disappointing cliffhanger.

At the end of the day I take this movie at its face value - some great historical facts, mixed in with some human biases and misinformation. I doubt it will be watched much again.",1356652800,,2269,4.561274509803922

The way it was created, with lots of dramatization and special effects makes it fun to watch, which is great for learning and remembering material ! I was literally glued to the screen, watching it very intently. Very broad in scope, it goes over a vast body of material, so it does not get into a lot of details about even some of the most significant developments in history, but that is understandable given the ambitious nature of the project. One of the things I loved about the documentary is it tells a lot of stories of lesser known people and their impact on development of civilization. That makes it more memorable and easier to relate to the material, as opposed to just having very sweeping and impersonal narrative.
I recommend everyone to watch it, but do know that it can get a bit violent since the history of Mankind was steeped in blood and warfare.

This series is very MAN oriented and not inclusive of Womankind.  The references to a few women are usually one or two per episode.  It is a story of the agressive, greedy, and power-hungry aspects of the human race. It is about conquest and war, as well as the building of bigger and taller penis-shaped structures.

I would like very much to see a companion series which would include the many FEMALE inventors, pioneers, peacemakers, and those who upheld ethical/moral positions.  It would have also been good if the MALES who were 'kind' or gentle or even balanced were included.

Hast thou ridden through the air on a broomstick?""

First let me pay tribute to Josh Brolin's excellent narration.  Working from an excellent script, he combined the right balance of gravitas and breathless awe in describing the man's greatest achievements. Peter Coyote and David McCullogh have always been my benchmarks for big-scale documentary narrations, and Brolin easily matches them.
Second: The pacing and editing was well done over all these hours of material. I especially liked the zeroing in on specific people ( some of whom even I, as an historian, was unaware of), to bring this vast story down to a manageable scale.
Third: The program bravely emphasized the paramount importance of war in the development of human 'progress'. I was continually amazed at the courage of the producers in making this very clear despite our anti-military, poltically correct era.
Fourth an most important: The producers overall selected the right events and people to tell the story of mankind. I have some disagreements, like where was the Renaissance?? Incredibly it received virtually no mention.  But given the thousands of years to be covered, not everything could be tackled. I was not particuarily impressed with the resident 'experts' that punctuated the narration. None of them were of sufficient renown for such a vast undertaking as this program.

5347044,4,B009LA1QZS,"As an AP art history teacher, this series helps my students ""see"" the progression of time and allows them visual references to help place artifacts they have studied into their rightful place in history. Watching the Viking burial scene and recalling the artifacts from the Sutton Hoo ship brings it all together better than reading Beowulf. I've enjoyed it and look forward to having for my classes on sub days, or to wrap up segments before exams.",1355184000,53,449,4.8441558441558445
5347045,2,B009LA1QZS,"I had high hopes for this series after seeing the previews for weeks, but after watching 4 or 5 episodes so far, I'm getting bored with it. Too much focus is spent on weapons, war, and military stuff. They have a military expert/former Navy Seal, weapons expert, and a Civil War expert as part of their roll of contributors to the stories, so you can see what their focus is. I have it DVR'd, so I find myself fast-forwarding through 30 to 45 minute blocks of boring gun and war stuff. Surely, there's more to mankind's story than weapons and war.

 I was hoping to see something along the lines of why we are the way we are- the different races, cultures, et cetera. That's what mankind is about. War and weapons. Gah. I'm removing Mankind from my DVR playlist. Just not interesting at all.",1355097600,9,791,4.448275862068965
5347046,1,B009LA1QZS,"Long ago and far away...I really wanted to like the History Channel and watched lots of their programming until the blatant errors and mixing of fact and fiction got to be too much. As I say, that was long ago when it first became a cable channel.

Sad to say, after watching the first episode that was it. In fact, I couldn't even make it completely through it. It could have been a really good show. The original concept is great. It's just a careless, superficial, and West European-centric documentary.",1355097600,18,506,4.622222222222222
5347047,2,B009LA1QZS,"If the story of ""Mankind"" is basically about fighting, warriors, competitive, persistently violent and further obscured by pseudo experts, like ex-military and television personalities, then this is the series for you. It's all glitz surrounding a hollow core. It's like the projection of the human story by a nine year old.  Don't waste your time on this tripe.",1354838400,16,362,5.241379310344827
5347048,5,B009LA1QZS,"I am a middle school history teacher so I purchased this to show my students. So far we have only watched about the Stone Age but my students BEGGED me to leave it on! They can't wait until we get to Egypt to watch more. I have several students who have been less than enthusiastic about history so when I hear those students leaving to go home & saying they're going to go home to watch the History Channel, and come back the next day actually having done it...very encouraging :)",1354752000,166,481,4.2967032967032965
5347049,3,B009LA1QZS,"This History Miniseries special is done by the same team as ""America: The Story of Us"" (which I loathed). The first positive that I noticed was that they got rid of the celebrity commentaries (for the most part, Brian Williams from NBC is one of the commentators on this one and I have to question what his authority is on world history). The information is shallow and basic. Any real historian or history buff will not learn that much new information. The presentation is well done. They have great graphics, cinematography, music, etc. Josh Brolin is an alright narrator, but his voice is fairly flat for me personally.

Once again, this is a very brief overview of humanity and civilization. They don't dive into many specifics and skip many major points in history entirely (No Cyrus, Alexander the Great, Punic Wars, Wars of the Three Kingdoms, No explanation of the Caliphs and Islam (straight to the Crusades), No Charlemagne and the Franks, No William the Conqueror, No focus on Japan or Korea (yet), No Southeastern Asia or India for that matter. They do a segment on Mali, very brief. Brief segments on the Aztecs, Incans, and Polynesians. It seems they are trying to take more obscure stories and tell them with European history (with some major ones: Christianity, Fall of Constantinople, Columbus, the Plague) along with giving a brief overview of non-European societies. If I wasn't a history teacher, it would be hard to follow sometimes.

Anyway, the episodes are what they are: Popcorn history. Their main purpose is entertainment and I will consider showing one or two of them in my classes for sick days with substitutes. Or maybe I will have the students do an assignment analyzing the validity of an episode with real historic research, who knows.",1354752000,16,1769,4.8933333333333335
5347050,5,B009LA1QZS,"This tries to cover a lot of ground in a short time, obviously, but as a way to get kids in particular to think history is exciting and interesting I think it's pretty good.  Not a complete source of info, but a great jumping-off point.

I teach history to 5th Graders and have kids of my own, so I watch these shows with an eye to what I know will engross children.  How often do you hear kids say, ""Oh, boy!"" when you tell them it's time for history??  These kinds of shows (and a great teacher) bring this stuff to life.

""Empires Pt. 1"" features Jesus, St. Paul, and an overview of the Roman Empire.  This was one of the highlights of the series, with great storytelling and exciting visuals of the scale and scope of Rome.",1354665600,22,727,4.231884057971015
5347051,1,B009LA1QZS,"Wow this series is pure revisionist progressive history that has a bunch of left wing liberals like Professor Gates and Brian Williams as commentators interspersed between the fabricated historical scenes - and what exactly qualifies these two for anything historical?

It paints whites and western European civilization as evil plunderers and the favored classes like Mexicans and Muslims are given a pass on any of THEIR violent tendencies or THEIR attempts to expand their territory. No it is just those evil white Europeans and Christians who are to blame for all the ills in the world. Unbelievable.

Goes to show you that you must do your OWN research and if you watch this you should check ALL the facts and see for yourself how biased this piece of crap is.

It is visually stunning but it is pure leftist propaganda!!!!!",1354665600,23,829,4.9071428571428575

8542798,4,B009LA1QZS,"I found this movie informative. They have a nice way of bringing up a lot of related factors in the history of mankind and then bringing them all together from around the world to show how they're all a part of our greater story, all influencing and influenced by one another. And this process is done through different areas of mankind's stages (inventions, survival instinct, et cetera). One irritation I have is regarding Christianity. That one religion gets a main line mention several times whereas the Islamic and Judaism faiths, pretty much all other religions, get a brief mention, if that. The three big religions have influenced and are still influencing mankind's story equally. The more pagan and splinter religions are playing their part as well, so if you're going to bring in one religion, how can you really skip the others? That's the part that really doesn't sit well with me. I get it that they wanted to appease the Christian audience, but that still doesn't in any way make it right.",1528934400,,1004,4.809248554913295

We both really enjoyed it. It definitely has its flaws- the script is highly repetitive (there are a LOT of moments that change America... FOREVER- overly dramatic much?), the interviews are with random celebrities, and it seems like they just gave up for the last couple of episodes. Somebody really wants you to know that technology is behind everything that has happened... FOREVER).
