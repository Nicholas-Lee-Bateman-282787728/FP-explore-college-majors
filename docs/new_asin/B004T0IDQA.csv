8440360,1,B004T0IDQA,"This is someone's idea of a bad joke. This is not a lost or restored movie, it is simply 5 of the Superman cartoons spliced together from that era. The description states that Superman battles Tesla, and his henchman Marconi, and of course nothing like this can be found in these spliced together cartoons. On top of everything else this feature is made from an inferior copy. I own the two disk of the original cartoons, (beautifully done), and they are what you should, or what you can download for free from the internet, as they are now considered public domain. I would hope that Amazon pulls this product from its site, before they get a bad reputation for allowing con artists and crooks from posting such lies and garbage on their site.",1385769600,,744,4.601503759398496
8440361,3,B004T0IDQA,"Older cartoon, found this by accident while researching something totally different.  Tesla came up an another search and as we dug deeper we realized that our friend who likes Superman would possibly like this.",1357776000,,211,5.205882352941177
8440362,2,B004T0IDQA,"This is actually several of the Flischer shorts edited together to make one movie. Because of this, there is no real plot. The episodes included are: The prologue from The Mad Scientist, Volcano, Billion Dollar Limited, The Bulleteers, Destruction, Inc., Terror on the Midway, The Mummy Strikes, The Mechanical Monsters, The Underground World, & The Magnetic Telescope. In a couple places the transitions are a little clumsy in an attempt to make one cohesive film. The few classic commercials included are not worth the extra price. Also, the interactive menu did not work. All I could select was ""Play All."" I would save my money & buy all 17 movies in a boxed set for a cheaper price right here on Amazon. Or, if you want, Wikipedia says they are all public domain and you can download them for free.",1340236800,4,803,4.742857142857143
8440363,1,B004T0IDQA,"This product is a total rip off, there is no lost 1942 film. What you get instead is the Superman cartoons shorts. These I already have. Don't waste your money, you can get these cartoons elsewhere and in superior quality. The opening and endings are cut out, so one short merges into the other.",1338249600,3,295,4.481481481481482
8440364,1,B004T0IDQA,do not waste your money this is not a lost superman movie this is bits and pieces of superman movies from the complete diamond anniversary edition superman collection,1336521600,3,166,4.964285714285714
8440365,5,B004T0IDQA,"This is not really a review--it's more of a question. I have always enjoyed the Flischer Superman cartoons, which is why the 5 stars. But does anybody know what this movie is? Is it a longer version of ""The Mad Scientist"" first Superman cartoon? I never heard anything about the Fleischers creating a Superman ""movie"" at all. I hope someone can make it clear to me what this product actually is.",1335484800,,395,4.577464788732394
