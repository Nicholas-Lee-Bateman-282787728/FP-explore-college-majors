4782035,5,B005LAIIKS,"I watched this movie yesterday and I think that is a wonderful movie.
It shows all frustration and anxiety of a couple that couldn't have their biological baby.
I guess all right things and all mistakes they made were based in their wishes/expectations planned by them if they could have a baby.
I recommend this movie and I will buy it when it comes out.",1345593600,3,355,4.476923076923077
4782036,5,B005LAIIKS,"So often people complain that current films lack quality matched with wholesome family films of years gone by...well needless to say it is here. What I am thoroughly impressed by is that this was put out by Disney and yet didn't feel like the typical live action Disney film. I was blown away by it's depth and it's heart.
For children it is a good lesson on tolerance and compassion.  For parents and teachers it will hit straight to the heart. The young couple are pitch perfect in their performance and is probably Garner's best film aside from Juno. The young boy playing the title character will impress you with his depth,  sweetness and will steal your heart.
What I love about this film is it's simple reminder of how we all put such a value on superficial ideals and status. I think what this films showcases is that despite failing never give up, even if you fail again. That you don't always have to be the best at something not to have great value.  To let pure love lead our lives,  minds, and hearts. That children don't have to be a star athlete or a next American Idol..to be considered a great gift that should be honored and not abused or taken on lightly.
I truly love this film greatly. I will be adding it to my collection and would highly recommend this for a gift or purchase.  This film is recommended for 7 years old and up. Be embraced by the magic of Timothy Green. It's not odd, it's wonderful.",1345507200,76,1422,4.412213740458015
4782037,5,B005LAIIKS,"When Cindy and Jim Green learn that they are not able to have children, they spend one final evening imagining what their child would have been like (a name of Timothy, a talented artist, a big heart, honest to a fault, etc.).  They put all those qualities in a box and bury it in their garden in their effort to ""move on.""  But unusual things happen that night - a huge storm rains only on their house and a little boy named Timothy (with leaves growing out of his ankles) shows up in their house, muddy and naked.

He immediately calls them Mom and Dad and, after realizing that he is a magical gift from the garden, they welcome him and the challenges of parenthood, learning along the way.

The plot is fantastic and a little plodding.  After all, it's basically following a fairly normal ten year-old about his everyday activities.  The real joy of this movie is the characters (and the talented actors who portray them).  There are lots of meaningful messages in this film about what constitutes a family, what it means to be a parent, balancing protecting children and allowing them to grow, and honesty.  I teared up several times and I certainly wasn't the only one in the audience pulling out the tissues.

There's nothing very surprising or shattering about this film, but sometimes it's good just to be reminded to take joy in the simple/important things in life.",1345420800,66,1375,4.625514403292181
4782038,5,B005LAIIKS,"This movie was amazing. Yes Jennifer Garner was wonderful as usual.  But the lead role and most of the kudos go to CJ Adams who played Timothy (Green).  He really made the movie come alive.  He was so smart, and angelic, and really made you fall in love with the character and believe in him.  I think he's got a big future in 'the biz'.

The story was very intriguing.  It makes for entertainment from start to finish.  I have to say, this is not very ""Hallmarky"" at all. Some might expect that. But it's not.  Also if you don't see it coming, the ending will require a small supply of tissues.
Also the music was very fun, and pretty.

10 out of 10 for acting, directing, and story.

I recommend this one whole-heartedly!",1345334400,,723,4.3283582089552235
4782039,3,B005LAIIKS,"Myself, husband, and 12 and 16 year old daughters got to see this movie on board a Disney Cruise the day it opened.  My 12 year old was pretty excited about it, and I had seen the previews and thought it could really be a great movie.  Well, depending on your parenting styles I suppose, it was an okay movie.  Timothy is played very well by the actor, and who doesn't love Jennifer Garner?  I really enjoyed the beginning of the movie, the magical appearance of Timothy and the joy of ""his parents"".  But then, it just got too unbelievable.  Sure, I can go along with a boy coming out of a garden with leaves on his legs, but his parents behavior just didn't pan out for me.  The worst was the whole soccer thing.  Clearly the boy couldn't play soccer, didn't care to play soccer, but yet he is on a team where he doesn't get to play and he is happy being the water boy.  What enlightened parent puts their child on a team where he gets no respect and sits on the bench for every game?  That seemed so selfish of the parents to me.  And then the mom going after Timothy's best friend, Joni.  She lets her son do whatever he wants (no after school supervision) and then complains to the girl he likes, and who treats him as an equal, that she is no good for him???  At least she comes to see the light, but her judgmental behavior is not anything to admire.  And really, would a girl that cool(?), and that much older than Timothy really hang out with him?  Of course she could, but I would have thought they might have made the 2 kids look more the same age.  To me it looked like an elementary school kid hanging out with a middle school kid, it just didn't fit right. And Timothy is losing leaves left and right, don't the ""parents"" notice that?

  Still, it is an entertaining movie, I just wish they would have done a few things differently to make it seem more realistic, or perhaps, portray the parents in a better light.  They should have risen to the occasion instead of being petty and competitive and trying to make Timothy something he wasn't.  My daughter loved it and continues to berate us for our over analysis of it.  Her 10 year old friend was in tears at the end of the movie, as were others, and I can still recommend seeing it, but I had hoped it was a movie I would treasure, but it is just a movie I thought was okay.",1345248000,5,2340,4.21123595505618
4782040,5,B005LAIIKS,"It is unusual for a movie to be released mid-week, but this one opened Wednesday and so I was able to go on opening day.  I was quite pleased with this fantasy film and think it contains excellent messages.  Like the story ""Tuck Everlasting"", it is packaged in a family-type wrapping, but in many ways it is a fable for adults.  There is a lot of symbolism that will be lost on younger children, and I think it can be watched by ALL but appreciated more by older children and adults.

The film starts by dealing with the painful reality that many couples face when they are told they are not able to conceive children.  In their grief, the couple writes on pieces of paper about what they had dreamed for their child.  He'll be artistic, he'll score the winning goal in a game, he'll be kind, and he'll have all the qualities that they have themselves, etc.  They bury these in a box in the garden and overnight a miracle happens.  The child they had dreamed of appears in their garden.  This leads to interesting and humourous consequences.

This movie has a number of lessons.  Children can learn from how the story embraces the idea that it's okay to be different.  Having something unique about you is good, and you don't need to be ashamed to show it.  Also, moms and dads are human and are doing the best they can.  Sometimes they make mistakes, but are figuring out a lot of things as they go.  The deeper theme which is more likely to be appreciated by teens and adults is about how children are a gift that is not to be squandered.  We see the various ""pitfalls of parenting"" and mistakes that parents make in real life.  The parents are shown as well meaning but making mistakes as they try to figure out what to do. Parenting is shown as a learning process too!  Also, the idea that we have only a certain amount of time with our children comes across very clearly.  We have valuable opportunities to touch each other's lives, but time passes quickly.

I didn't really understand what ""brief language"" they were talking about in the review, but during the second viewing I think I heard the ""h-word"" a couple of times. One character says, ""Oh dear God"" and I think the obnoxious sister character may have said God's name once quietly.  I am very sensitive to such things, but was not offended by this movie at all.  In fact it was advertised as having a G rating here in Canada.  My personal preference would be that they prayed for a child.  In the story we assume it is magic, but we don't know the source of the miracle.

I found this movie to be quite moving and was thinking a lot about the story after I left the theatre.  This film really has a bit of everything:  depth, humour, lessons, and a bit of romance too. The cinematography, especially the scenes with the Autumn leaves, is very beautiful and you can tell the director is good because of his attention to detail. I also like how the couple has a loving marriage and treat each other with kindness and respect.  It's just so nice to see a clean movie that also contains depth that can be appreciated by people of all ages.  It's a keeper!  :)",1344988800,25,3119,4.4020979020979025
4782041,5,B005LAIIKS,"A loving couple cannot have children. But, to their amazing surprise, a young boy suddenly appears at their home. They convince themselves that Timothy came from the garden, but accept him as their own child. They attempt at good parenting, and of course, there are many challenges, and trials-and-tribulations. Most important, Timothy has a hidden secret that he must reveal. The film portrays the true meaning of parenting, and there are happy moments as well as sad. Acting Performance is Excellent, Enjoyable, and Entertaining. Highly Recommended!",1344643200,4,551,5.4186046511627906
4782042,4,B005LAIIKS,"MOVIE REVIEW # 46: "" The Odd Life Of Timothy Green ""

Director Peter Hedges (Dan In Real Life) wrote the screenplay from a story conceived by Ahmet Zappa that really encompasses simple family values. It has the passion in it enough to grab your heart strings - and tug a little on them - more than once.

The story is fanciful and magical in nature and has a touch of sci-fi thrown in, but the real thrust of this drama is the family unit. It's about parents and their children and how a small town deals with the drama's of a failing economy, bragging relatives and the gossip of neighbors that happens everywhere and anywhere you may live! It tends to slow down in a couple places - but there are very memorable scenes throughout.

Now, imagine not being able to have children, for whatever reason - and you and your spouse found a unique way of coming to terms with it - by `wishing' the qualities you would like your `dream child' to have and then in superficial way planting them in the ground.

Enter the element of magic, sci-fi or the `powers' from above - and a small child - played with such style, wit and humor by Cameron CJ Adams (Dan In Real Life) and you have a real family unit. His performances makes you smile more than once throughout the film and keeps you guessing about his motivations and origins.

The real heart of the movie is the wonderful performances the two leads do together of showing true parenting - played perfectly by Jennifer Garner (Alias, Juno, Daredevil) and Joel Edgerton (The Thing-2011, Star Wars - Episode 2 & 3). Their on screen chemistry they had was completely heart-warming and when adding Cameron into the mix, the scenes with the three of them was extremely real.

One other notable performance was by the amazing Ms. Dianne Weist (Edward Scissorhands, Parenthood) who gives perfect performance of a stiff, uptight and over-indulged boss of Jennifer - will make you remember her `chinny-chin-chin'! You'll have to see it to understand that reference! Dianne will definitely make you roll yours and even laugh more than once throughout the film.

Special note to composer Geoff Zanelli (Gamer, Secret Window) - who created a modern and audibly unique score for the film. It moved the emotions of comedy and drama very seemlessly and I believed helped in the overall ambiance and mood of the film.

This is a really good film for the entire family - a little short of story - but real in delivery.  It portrays real people in a `magical-sci-fi' situation that brings forth what new parents are really dealing with. It also ends on a very happy note! Timothy Green is Green to go!",1344556800,9,2627,4.60813704496788
4782043,5,B005LAIIKS,"I went to the prescreening of this movie and loved it. I'm a big fan of Jennifer Garner and a new fan of Joel Edgerton (Warrior was absolulutley amazing!)  This movie has a great combination of humor, sadness, and love. The movie is rated PG, but it's not really a movie I would think my kids would enjoy mainly for the adult emotions that I think are present in the movie. The storyline is pretty simple, a couple that cannot have children are surprised by child showing up at their house one night and beliving he came from the garden (due to the leaves growing on his legs) they make alot of parenting mistakes, but love their new child. All while Timothy has a secret he isn't telling them about his leaves...Overall I will be buying this movie when it's released!",1344038400,92,768,4.446808510638298

4782312,3,B005LAIIKS,"Bizarre is the best way I can describe this movie. I remember the viral video of the two kids crying hysterically in the back seat of a car after watching this film, and now I sort of get it. A small town couple aren't able to conceive so they dream up the perfect kid, write it down, put it in a box and plant it in the garden. During a rainstorm Timothy magically appears and then becomes their child for a short period of time. He has leaves growing on his legs to represent each of the ""wishes"" his parents made when creating him. Okay, so that's the premise, and it's not a bad one, but even for a fantasy movie/kids movie there are plot holes all over this. The movie is never sure if it wants to focus on the parents or on Timothy, and there is little to no formal explanation as to how the Timothy growing in the backyard magic works. The audience is basically just told that he can't talk about it and don't ask questions. Well sorry but that just doesn't work. As much as I believe strongly in the suspension of disbelief in any film, you still have to justify things even when making a fantasy based movie. I kept thinking about social security numbers and enrolling a child in school with no paperwork and then there's the ending which I won't give away, but let's just say the lack of police involvement just isn't even remotely believable. Yes, I get that you shouldn't overthink things too much with a movie like this, but the plot itself wasn't ""magical"" or engaging enough to put those things to the side. The little boy who plays Timothy is adorable and does a great job, and Jennifer Garner has perfected the art of playing a concerned mom in her string of recent films. It's a nice simple movie that looks gorgeous but the concept is surprisingly complicated and you don't get much delivery on it. Older kids will probably be more confused than upset by this film, but it's definitely safe to watch with the family.",1509580800,,1935,4.392757660167131

4783733,5,B005LAIIKS,"One of the best feel good movies, ever. Timothy is completely and utterly lovable and wise. He shows up (from the garden) to show a childless couple what it means to be parents; and that making parenting mistakes are not something that should make them feel like they can't be good parents. This is a must-have part of a good DVD collection.",1452556800,,341,4.516129032258065
4783734,3,B005LAIIKS,"This is a movie that although perfectly watchable and a more than amicable way to pass an hour and forty minutes, certainly isn't one of the greatest movies of all time, as a lot of reviewers would have you believe.  It has some major plot holes, that you could plant a kid size tree in and the whole interview in the adoption agency side story where the visit by Timothy a real life cabbage patch kid 11 year old who turns up in the middle of the night covered in dirt, told through a flashback to the adoption panel was completely ridiculous.  What government agency employee is going to just sit there for over an hour while a couple who have refused to fill out their forms properly, even after they've reminded them they have to and instead tells a far fetched tale.  They're either going to be told to stop wasting their time after a minute or two at the most or if the panel actually believes that the couple believes they had a plant boy, will be quickly referred to a mental health unit and barred from the adoption process completely.

Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton play the couple in the adoption agency who haven't been able to fall pregnant so decide just for the fun of it to bury a box full of words (traits) that describe how perfect their kid would have been, in their farm's vegetable patch behind the house. A stormy night has Jim Green (Joel) going downstairs to check on a noise where he discovers the front door is open.  Not really behaving the way someone would in a situation where there is probably a prowler in his house he eventually returns to bed, only to discover someone who is not his wife Cindy is under the covers. Eventually he and his wife discover a dirt covered 11 year old boy hiding in another part of the house.  Now instead of grabbing the kid and immediately calling the cops, Cindy decides the boy should have a bath, and creepily stays in the bathroom while he does.  Eventually Jim does call 911 which is answered by someone he knows who asks him how's he been instead of asking if his emergency needs the police, fire or ambulance.  Jim decides at his wife's prompts to hang up at that moment.  Since the kid has said his name is Timothy and that was their dream kids' name, they decide to keep him.  No one seems to have a problem with this, even though it is a small town and it is obvious they didn't have the kid before.  To further complicate matters, the kid has leaves growing out of his legs, and Jim and Cindy are adamant that he not let anyone know.  They ignoring every horror movie they've likely seen try and make this mysterious Timothy being their ideal child.  They decide to shelter and protect him from the ills of the world, and be the parents that their parent's weren't.  Of course they are not very good at it and make plenty of mistakes.

Obviously a movie where you've got to accept it's possible for a kid (and an 11 year old at that) to come out of the ground has to a have a certain level of disbelief but this one just has too much.  Such as how did they enroll him in school with no birth certificate or school reports and the like?  For that matter, they never asked him if he even remembers being alive before he turned up.  They live on a farm yet both work, Jim in a pencil factory and Cindy in an art museum.  Both places of employment not only have a bring your child to work day, but simultaneously have it on the exact same day.  No one else in either place brings their kid to work, perhaps being new to parenting, Jim and Cindy never caught on that kids would rather be, well anywhere else.  Cindy's boss for some reason is an MC at a pencil factory meeting for its employees about their future. Adults in this aren't very nice people, not just the obvious villains like the pencil boss but relatives who know Cindy is full of it but are prepared to humiliate Timothy rather than just call her out on her lie in front of other adults by saying we'll give Timothy a solo tonight then.  Why would Jim's dad come to each soccer game to watch his new grandchild be a water boy when he didn't even attend Jim's games who was a player?

Parts of the movie such as the soccer are pretty predictable, as well as the ending. Ultimately it's not one you regret watching but isn't something that will stick with you in years to come or that you'll ever watch a second time.",1452297600,,4353,4.314110429447853

I only have two things that stop me from giving this WONDERFUL typical DISNEY video 5 stars. The young girl is far to tall and to old looking,, and her parents are far from ideal. Also, Timmy's parents treat each other, and Timmy wrong.  Admittedly this was something they put in the ""wish box"". (ie, admitting they would not be perfect but would learn). I was a counselor & teacher so forgive me, maybe that is one of the lessons they are pointing out to us. It likely points out understanding is important for real children to realize that they and their parents are NOT PERFECT!. No one is, even the rich family and coach. Parents or for that matter everyone should not SHOUT at each other or very understanding Timmy.
Enjoy the video, and don't take it apart like I may have. GO DISNEY!",1441843200,,927,4.447058823529412

4784668,5,B005LAIIKS,"Somehow, I missed hearing about The Odd Life of Timothy Green until just a couple weeks ago.  When I started seeing previews, it intrigued me, and the fact that it starred Jennifer Garner sealed the deal.  I'm glad I hear about it because I enjoyed it.

After trying for years, Cindy and Jim Green (Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton) have finally gotten the news that they will never be able to have kids of their own.  Saddened beyond words, they try to move on with their lives, but Jim decides an exercise might help them.  They write down exactly what they would have wanted their child to be on slips of paper and then bury it in the backyard.

That night a storm hits and in the middle of the storm Timothy (CJ Adams) enters their lives.  Confused at first, they begin to put the pieces together when they see the leaves on his legs.  Are they ready to be parents?  And what secrets might Timothy be hiding?

I must admit I was a little worried about how this story might progress, and it quickly became clear early on where things were going.  In fact, if I had one criticism, it is that the movie is very predictable.

It also falls more on the drama side of the dramedy line it tries so hard to straddle.  I was wiping tears off and on over the course of the entire movie.  But that's not to say there were some laughs as well.  Many snuck up on me, and the way the actors played them was so perfect that you couldn't help but laugh.

Speaking of the actors, all of them were great.  While Timothy is in the title, the story is really about Cindy and Jim, and Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton were so great as the leads.  CJ Adams has the unenviable job of making a basically perfect child not sickening, and he pulls it off perfectly.  In fact, all three of them walked that fine balance just right, and in the end you wind up loving the characters.  The rest of the cast is just as good, further pulling you into the movie.

While this is a PG Disney film, I think it is aimed more at adults than kids.  The story is about the mistakes you make as a parent, the things you learn from your own parents and those around you and how all that influences you in your attempts at parenting.  While there is plenty of scenes that involve Timothy, I'm not sure that a child will sit through the entire movie.  I, on the other hand, really felt for the characters and began to get caught up in their lives.  There is also a sub-plot involving the local pencil factory that many kids won't appreciate as much as adults will.

Having said that, the movie is pretty clean.  A tiny bit of violence and a could of mild swear words are the main reasons the film gets its PG rating.

And I've got to mention the cinematography.  Set in the fall near a small town, there are lots of beautiful shots of nature and the outdoors, including lots of beautiful fall foliage.  I know it's not a reason to see a film, but it is a nice bonus.

Ultimately, this movie is about people who touches our lives and what we take from that.  It's very much a life affirming film that left me feeling content and very happy to have seen it.

4784790,3,B005LAIIKS,"The Odd Life of Timothy Green
 This odd trip into magical realism is a sort of Russian folk tale meets Disney.  A childless couple, in an act of wine influenced catharsis, writes down the characteristics that their perfect child would have had.  He would have a sense of humor, be artistic and musical but not very athletic and so on.  They put the notes in a box, then bury the box, and they hope their sadness in the back garden.  In true Disney fashion, that night a boy appears from the garden, their perfect son.  But in Russian folk tale tradition, he has a terrible, heart breaking secret.
 Oh yeah, the boy from the garden has leaves growing from his legs.
 Writer/director Peter Hedges made this charming, if schmaltzy little movie.  I admit that it is effective at tugging the heart strings of the audience, which is a nice change from other films which simply pile on the adrenaline in savage appeals to our darker natures.  Hedges also wrote and directed Pieces of April and Dan in Real Life and wrote the better known Whats Eating Gilbert Grape.  All his films are safely outside of the main stream of Hollywood fare.
 The one hour 40 minute movie features Jennifer Garner in one of her best roles, certainly a better role than Electra. She is the distraught mom of the boy from the garden.  She and husband (quietly and strongly played by Joel Edgerton) live in a small town dominated by a failing pencil factory.  They are ordinary in the plain sense of the word.  They are not particularly smart nor beautiful nor rich, just regular folks trying to get along in life as best they can and not having a very easy time of it.  The actors show that having each other, while not quite enough, is actually quite a bit and the couple does realize what a gift each is to the other.  But the garden boy, perfect from their point of view, perks them up.
 Twelve year old CJ Adams plays the boy with smiling cuteness. He and Peter Hedges also worked together in Dan in Real Life.  His young lady friend, an older girl, becomes infatuated with the young boy-another fabulous part of the story.  Thirteen year old girls fall for 15 year old boys not 10 year olds, as the garden boy is written.  But what a knock out job Israeli born Odeya Rush does in the role.  We will see a lot more of her in the future, I hope.
 Ron Livingston, a favorite of mine, plays the scion of the pencil family.  M. Emmet Walsh is the uncle where the garden boy gets his sense of humor.  There is a lovely scene between Walsh and Adams and the best lines of written dialog are with the two of them.  Rapper Common plays the soccer coach.  His career as an actor continues to gain credibility.  I didn't recognize him and thought him to be just another actor, a high compliment for someone making the cross over from music to film.
 The three saw blade, one hanky film has a PG rating.  Very small kids will not understand the movie.  The producers risked $25 million making it and have gathered $15 million at the box office domestically.  It has not gone overseas yet but this should be a solid money maker.
 Writer Director Peter Hedges must be an interesting guy.  He certainly is imaginative.",1430611200,,3178,4.4411764705882355

4785429,4,B005LAIIKS,"This is a lovely movie about the wonderful twists and turns life takes when a child comes into your life. It's sweet, heartwarming, and at times funny - but I wouldn't exactly call it a ""feel-good"" movie.

This isn't the kind of movie that I enjoy - it's the kind that I endure. I'd put it in the same category as ""Beaches"" - the ultimate benchmark for heartwarming movies that make you cry. I love that movie, but the ONE time I saw it I sobbed so hard at the end that my face was swollen the next day, and I was so emotionally drained that I knew I'd never be able to watch it again. This movie isn't nearly so heavy hitting, but it's *that* type of movie. I knew five minutes in that it was going to have a sad, emotional ending, and I wasn't looking forward to it.

I gave it four stars because overall it's a lovely movie. The child who plays Timothy is tooth-achingly sweet, and his performance is outstanding. The story is magical and clever, and while at times predictable, the movie flows along at a nice pace. The look and feel of the movie was gorgeous (how can you not love autumn leaves?), and I thought the actors all did a nice job with their roles (even if they were a bit clichd). Add that up and you end up with roughly four stars.

I thought it was a beautiful movie and I'm glad I saw it - but ONLY because I knew it was a tear-jerker going in and had mentally geared myself up for it. It does send a beautiful message about love, adoption, and celebrating your gifts & what makes you unique. That said, I doubt I will ever watch this movie again. This isn't the kind of movie that lifts you up at the end - it's the kind that breaks your heart. Once was enough for me.",1419638400,,1689,4.127659574468085

Just like in Mary Poppins the letter the children write that ends up shredded in the fireplace, to which Mary Poppins is a perfect fit, the buried notes of the perfect child are buried and produce their desire.

It's just a little to mystical in the overall plot, that a boy goes around preparing adults for children?  That's hard to embrace.  The acting fits the film and Timothy does a good job.

The sister was a domineering braggart, the father/grandfather was emotionally unavailable, the factory manager was sleezy, the factory owner was a touch old broad (but we suspected she had a heart underneath), the wife's boss was a b***ch...I probably missed a few cliches...but trust me, the movie didn't.

Although I rated the film average, the message and moral quality of the story is above average and the main characters put their heart into it.

4787339,4,B005LAIIKS,"The Odd Life of Timothy Green introduces us to Cindy and Jim Green who would love to have a joy in their life in the form of a child. Things don't always go as planned (in the real world and on screen) and just as Cindy and Jim are about to call it quits the get exactly what they have been wanting.

I liked just about every aspect of this movie. The actors (both young and old) were well sequenced. The Direction, led by Peter Hedges was well set up. Combined with an engaging story, this movie has 3 (not too long), but charming acts, and a great message behind it.

In Short, wheter you are 32 years old, 75 years old, or even 13 years old, this movie is definitely one to watch. Definitely a family movie, deifinitely a fun movie, and definitively a heartwarming adventure. Great job by the cast, and Great job by Disney.

4787540,4,B005LAIIKS,"The Odd Life of Timothy Green 4 stars

This has Jennifer Garner (one of my Grandpa's ""girlfriends"") and surprisingly with Dianne Wiest CJ and Ron Livingston. Actually the acting was well done all around. This is definitely one of those family movies I'll watch again and again. And I say so what if this was a Disney ""feel good"" movie. It did leave a smile on mine and my Grandpa's face at the end. And no tear-jerkers too.

The storyline is nice and, I think, original. It's about a young boy who magically appears in the Green's life after the couple plants a wish in their backyard. Their wish is their ideal child because they've just learned they can't conceive their own. So that right there, I think is aimed more for the older kids who (like say maybe over 8). The Green's get to have Timothy in their life and as their son for less than a year (I think it's less than - not sure). So it's about the couple's hardships in raising Timothy. I also think that by opening with the child adaption interview, there wasn't too much sadness felt towards the end because you knew that was going to happen.

This is a good family movie. Yes, it's unbelievable. But there was a lot of good hidden meanings throughout the movie. The key one was the couple doing everything they can in making sure that Timothy had a ""normal"" childhood even though he was ""special."" And doing everything they can to make the impossible seem possible for Timothy.",1378684800,,1440,4.488549618320611
4787691,5,B005LAIIKS,"I bought it for a gift,so I wasn't able to watch it. But it was on tv this early a.m. and I was able to. It is different and heartfelt and for both men and women. Not a chick flick or a rooster flick,a husband and wife who love one another and want a child. It is a feel good movie  with lessons from  a husband who always sat on the bench and is still not good enough for his Dad,and then can't have a child. So the story begins and life becomes exciting and the snobbie ""I have it all sister with all the kids"" is brought up short by the abnormal not the perfect which is what the movie is showing. abnormal is perfect to normal people. I would recommend it first for parents. I thought it was a family picture,but younger kids,say 8 and under wouldn't get  it or would it hold their interest. Grandparents are loved in this movie as well. Families are embraced. Great movie.",1378512000,,877,4.147058823529412

I have always loved movies that challenge the idea of ""being normal""; that challenge the idea that conformity is the way to go.  ""Dead Poets Society"" was a movie aimed at teens and young adults.  ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" targets parents.  The beauty of this film is that the parents are not learning from other adults or parents, but from a child.  Everyone is different in some way.  And it is these differences that our society and the world, tend to frown upon rather than celebrate.

Timothy Green wears his heart and his wisdom on his sleeve.  One of the things that you will quickly note about Timothy is that he really doesn't care what anyone thinks of him.  He is being himself to the best of his ability.  It is funny because this is something that we are all trying to do.

Jim and Cindy Green are devastated when they are given news that they will never be able to bear children of their own.  It's a depressing night when they come back from the doctor's.  It is plainly obvious that a huge dream is shattered for both of them.  In an attempt to find some way to reconcile themselves to the news, Jim comes up with an idea of writing down the traits/abilities that their ""perfect"" child would have or be able to do.  On small sheets of notebook paper, they soon take delight in mapping out their ideal child.  They put the pieces of paper into a cigar box and bury it in out in the garden.  A lightning storm comes along, and here comes Timothy Green with green leaves on his legs (you might take note that each leaf is in the shape of a heart!).  This is one of those films where you just have to cast conventional wisdom aside.  Try not to question too many things, or you will lose touch with the magic of the film.  After all, magic isn't magic if you question it or want an explanation about how it was done.  You just need to appreciate it.

Pretty soon, Timothy is quickly introduced to family and friends.  As he begins to perform the various things from the list, he loses a leaf from his leg.  Of course, this doesn't become aware to Jim and Cindy until the end when Timothy gives them his last pearl of wisdom.

The irony about Timothy and the things that he does according to the list, is that each is done in his own way.  In other words, he does his best even if the results are not what Jim or Cindy have envisioned.  A soccer match demonstrates this beautifully.

Timothy is talented and yet odd.  But, he has a magic within him that only a handful of people seem to appreciate.  His parents and his best friend Joni, a girl with her own secret to share.  The beauty of Timothy is that he is happy with who he is.  He doesn't try to be anything else.  And while Timothy doesn't become hurt or upset about what others think of him, the same can't be said about Jim and Cindy.  This is part of the wisdom that Timothy hopes to pass on to them.

As adults, we tend to bring our hurts and scars of our childhood with us.  We remember those hurts.  We still feel them.  And so, as parents, we do our absolute best to shield and protect our children from having to experience the same thing.  The funny part about Timothy is that this protection is not necessary.  And it takes some time before Jim and Cindy understand that they don't have to protect him from ridicule.

The performances in this film are outstanding.  Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton make the perfect couple.  They have great on-screen chemistry with each other as well as with CJ Adams, the child-actor who turns in a masterful performance as Timothy.  CJ's smile alone will melt your heart.

Some people have complained that this film is too sugary and melodramatic.  I disagree.  It has a terrific balance of light humor and feeling without becoming heavy.  Children and parents alike can watch and enjoy this film.  In fact, ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" should be required viewing for parents and children alike, as everyone can learn a little something about themselves.

Parents aren't perfect, and the best wisdom we can pass on to our children is to appreciate your differences because they are part of what makes you unique; they are part of what makes you who you are.

So, if you're in the mood for a warm-hearted film that will leave you smiling after, then you really can't go wrong with this film.",1372204800,,4339,4.415404040404041

Whilst I can't deny that there are huge great big holes in the plot, if you're going to nitpick - you'd still find something else to single out: then again, you take your 'fairy stories' as they're told, you just accept the magic for what it it is; & this film is no different.  The ending, whilst not totally unexpected, is also a refreshingly different take on 'happily ever after.'",1371859200,,545,4.494949494949495

Don't get me wrong, it was worth watching and I absolutely love Jen Garner (However I'd rather watch a couple episodes of Alias than this movie) . All in all , it was a pretty decent movie but I won't give 5 stars to something that is just pretty good.  My ratings for movies go as follows:
 1-2 stars - don't waste your time
 3 stars -rent don't buy.
 4 stars- would watch again.
 5 stars - would watch it again several times.

Loved it!",1370649600,,415,5.028985507246377
4788312,2,B005LAIIKS,"Odd indeed.  This PG rated ""family film"" features a loving couple played by Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Garner who have been unsuccessful at having a biological child.  The film opens at an adoption center where they are making their case to adopt a child, the basis of which is shown in flashback.

It seems Jim and Cindy Green, unhappy over their inability to conceive - we never learn exactly why - play a fantasy game of what their perfect child would be like.  They write down the characteristics on paper, place them in a small box and bury them in their garden.  After a rain storm, voil!, a 10 old boy appears in their home covered in dirt.  He also has a few irremovable leaves on his legs.

Unfortunately this film, written and directed by Peter Hedges, is so sugary sweet and bereft of artistic value, it was just hard to watch.  Certainly Jennifer Garner wasn't a stretch to play the part of mom-of-the-year but she is given ridiculous dialog.  In one scene she is explaining to her new ""son"" that most of his schoolmates come from their mother's tummies, not from the ground.  Good grief.  And Edgerton, I suspect hoping to stretch his acting chops, just kind of stands around looking forlorn most of the time.  Terribly miscast.  While the film will surely appeal to some families looking for something safe, this film should have been buried along with the box of wishes.",1370390400,,1385,4.627049180327869

4788317,4,B005LAIIKS,kids liked this one.  The only thing (spoiler alert) is when Timothy had to leave at the end.  It was pretty emotional for the kids.  Ending was upbeat and hopeful which helped.  It was a slightly odd movie but definitely family friendly.,1370044800,,238,4.595238095238095

4788909,5,B005LAIIKS,"Yes, I'm watching I tell the kids....but man are these kids movies boring.  They loved it and that is what the rating is about.  The target audience thought the movie was great.  Adults should have a breathe right strip in place to prevent snoring as kids notice these things.",1366675200,,276,4.591836734693878

4789032,4,B005LAIIKS,"While the screen play had a few ""weak"" spots, the message of this film is clearly positive and uplifting.  I admire celebrities who take a role they know may not pay the top salary, BUT will help guide more positive, emotionally intelligent behavior between human beings.  Such celebrities contribute to the conscious evolution of the human species - AND create characters we would all like to have as our best friends.",1366329600,,419,4.887323943661972

4789035,3,B005LAIIKS,This is a great family movie with a little of a Pinocchio type twist. I recommend this for family movie night when younger kids need some help staying focused.,1366329600,,159,4.517241379310345
4789036,4,B005LAIIKS,"It's a fantastic tale told by two wanna-be parents. Another tear jerker. When I first saw the title of the film, I was uninterested and a bit turned off. It wasn't until I gave the film a chance that I was enchanted by the storyline. The little kid is also a wonderful actor and although it's clearly fantasy, the film touches many important issues.",1366243200,,349,4.46875

4789080,4,B005LAIIKS,The boy in the story was an excellent actor. His parents were also very believable. Nice mommy-daughter movie (she's 12),1366156800,,120,5.05
4789081,2,B005LAIIKS,My granddaughter would not even watch this.  She said it was uninteresting and turned it off after less than an hour.,1366156800,,117,4.571428571428571

4789086,1,B005LAIIKS,"I tried.  But the longer I sat watching this movie, the more ridiculous it became.  It was predictable and stupid in my opinion.  I had a real hard time sitting through it and afterwards, I wished I hadn't wasted my time.  I just wish it would have had some substance..  but for me, it came up empty.",1365984000,2,300,4.192982456140351

4789088,5,B005LAIIKS,"A great concept, a good twist and great cast. Recommended for a couples night in with jammies, wine and popcorn.",1365897600,,112,4.65
4789199,4,B005LAIIKS,"The film is about a magical pre-adolescent boy whose personality and navet have profound effects on the people in his town. He is ""born"" to a childless couple who have learned that they cannot have a child of their own.

This delightful Disney story is touching and the plot is endearing.

The story is told through the eyes of Cindy, who works in the town's local museum, and Jim, who is employed at the town's historic pencil factory, reside in the drought-stricken town of Stanleyville, North Carolina. They explain their experience with Timothy  in an effort to persuade an adoption agency to allow the couple to adopt a child.

Does sharing the story with the adoption agency work?

See for yourself.

You will love the movies if you are a big fan of Jennifer Garner and even if you are not.",1365897600,,796,4.609929078014185
4789200,2,B005LAIIKS,"Well, they got the title right. This movie is odd. It is a corny little fantasy movie. I knew it had gotten bad reviews and after watching it, I know why. I gave the movie two stars instead of one star because of the human relationship factor protrayed between the couple. Other than that, there really is very little redeeming value in this movie.",1365897600,,348,4.453125
4789201,3,B005LAIIKS,"I give it a three star, but my children would probably give 4 or 5. They were so touched by this movie, I even saw a few tears flowing. And best of all, they asked to see it again. (kids are 11, 8, 8)",1365811200,,200,3.5681818181818183
4789202,4,B005LAIIKS,"I had read reviews that this was an average movie so I wasn't expecting much.  Actually, I was pleasantly surprised by it.  My eight year old enjoyed it too.  There are some teary-eye moments but overall a clean and decent movie.",1365811200,3,229,4.536585365853658
4789203,5,B005LAIIKS,"It's an adorable story on how an infertile couple wishes for their ""perfect"" child and they bury paper with their wishes in the garden. Lil Timothy is born that night, albeit not a baby. My children 6,8,11 enjoyed the movie a lot and I found I was engaged with the antics this couple are retelling.",1365811200,,298,4.4363636363636365
4789204,1,B005LAIIKS,I hate to watch a movie where the child is more responsible than the adults. The movie would have been great if it had a different ending instead of the boy dying because he was more of a plant instead being a real child. It made no sense at all.,1365811200,4,246,3.94
4789205,3,B005LAIIKS,"Storyline was creative, but the plot became formalistic, and winter was anticipated.  The ending not so much as a surprise, but did provide a ""feel good"" ending.",1365724800,,161,4.962962962962963

4789208,2,B005LAIIKS,"This film was so slow and doesn't really make a lot of sense. I couldn't stay focused on watching it and kept getting up to go do other things. This is definitely not up to my standards of Disney. It was such a strange story, and was too difficult to stay interested in.",1365465600,,270,4.113207547169812
4789259,5,B005LAIIKS,Very poignant for anyone who has ever longed for a child. Delightful view on adoption that I hope inspires others to take that leap of faith.,1365465600,,141,4.461538461538462
4789260,5,B005LAIIKS,This was a cute family movie that has a great story line for everyone in the family.  Nice movie to see as a Family Night to help you laugh & cry all in the same movie.,1365379200,,168,3.6666666666666665
4789261,3,B005LAIIKS,It's a sweet movie but not one you want to watch to often. I'm glad I saw it but should have waited for it to be on Cable TV.,1365292800,,125,3.3448275862068964
4789262,5,B005LAIIKS,This movie is a wonderful family movie with a lot of love. Jennifer Garner does a superb job as a woman longing for a child and the outcome of her wishes.,1365292800,,154,4.0
4789263,4,B005LAIIKS,This movie is great but it made my 6 year old and I both cry at one point. So be prepared for a little sadness in it. Very well done though and you can't help but fall in love with the little boy.,1365120000,,196,3.5813953488372094
4789264,4,B005LAIIKS,"This is a nice, feel good flick that will put a little smile on your face.  Easy to watch with some good humorous parts.",1365033600,,120,4.0
4789265,4,B005LAIIKS,Recommended for families. A little too unbelievable for me. I rather watch movies that are real-life although I knew this one wasn't going into it.,1365033600,,147,4.92
4789266,4,B005LAIIKS,we enjoyed the movie however my sensitive 7 year old daughter did not do well with the sad parts at all,1365033600,,103,3.9523809523809526
4789267,1,B005LAIIKS,"I couldn't even finish watching his movie. It was painful to watch- the couple being ashamed of their unusual son even after wanting one so badly, bullying, shaming, a total lack of basic care toward another etc. Followed by absolutely horrific parenting choices that made me hope that if they were that inept as parents, that they would never get the chance to parent a ""real"" boy as much as they said they had learned from their mistakes.  This movie is intensely uncomfortable to watch and certainly cannot be considered a feel good.",1364947200,3,536,4.763440860215054
4789268,3,B005LAIIKS,This was a good family movie to watch.  Parts of it required you to stretch your imagination but for the most part is was good.,1364947200,,127,4.08

4789380,3,B005LAIIKS,"A bit slow. This movie was not fresh and much of the ""bad"" parenting scenes were very contrived. I did not like the narration as interwoven with the adoption interview.

It was someone inspiring as Timothy Green was a very good person with wholesome intentions. The movie did generate interesting questions from my children.",1364860800,,324,5.0
4789381,3,B005LAIIKS,It certainly was for young children.  I bought it for my 10 year old and she really didn't understand it.  And the moral was fuzzy,1364860800,,130,4.16
4789382,4,B005LAIIKS,Movie was great but the video quality was very poor. The video is very dark and kept lagging. The resolution was grainy and dark.,1364774400,,129,4.416666666666667
4789383,4,B005LAIIKS,"The film is similar in concept to the Nanny McPhee films where the lead loses some type of disfigurement for each satisfied goal, in this case a leaf.  It's a crazy concept but an interesting feel-good family movie  Stay away if you prefer reality or action films.",1364688000,,264,4.595744680851064
4789384,5,B005LAIIKS,"I loved this film. It is a touching story for the entire family. This movie is clean, but not over the top sugary. I would recommend it to anyone who needs to feel uplifted...If you are silent just long enough during this movie,you will feel subtle spiritual qualities. The actors are great, and the cinematography as well. Just awesome!",1364601600,,337,4.728813559322034

4789387,1,B005LAIIKS,not very good and the acting was fair at best.  the story line was too far out and it just didn't work for me,1364601600,2,109,3.5416666666666665

4789479,4,B005LAIIKS,"I have to admit, that like many, I didn't think much of this movie before I watched it it. I haven't heard about it and it wasn't some big hit at box office either. Though this movie really came through for me. It is a great movie. There is good chemistry between the actors, all of the emotion is convincing, and the issues are relatable. Give this movie a chance an you will be surprised.",1364515200,,390,4.213333333333333

4789481,3,B005LAIIKS,"This movie was pretty predictable from the start.  None-the-less, it wasn't a bad movie, just a pretty odd one.  Not one I would watch again.",1364515200,,141,4.6
4789482,5,B005LAIIKS,This was a delightful movie.  It was heart warming and touching.  What an impact a child makes on a family that hasn't had children.  I recommend this book to all.  I love Jennifer Garner anyways and she was so good in this movie.,1364428800,,230,4.27906976744186

4789485,5,B005LAIIKS,I bought this Disney movie for my collection as I enjoyed them growing up and wanted to also be able to share with children that come to visit me and in time for my grand kids. The DVD was packaged very well and I especially like the outside cover that it comes in which protects the movie itself. It was received in wonderful condition and I have no complaints. I will let everyone know the great experience I had purchasing it as well and will definitely buy from the seller again. This is a movie everyone can watch and enjoy.,1364342400,,529,4.3

4789821,2,B005LAIIKS,"The screenwriters for this movie must have been 5th graders. All the grown-up characters speak and behave like immature children. The dialog was so exaggerated and unrealistic that it became a huge distraction, ruining the mood they were trying to set. You'll find yourself thinking that adults would not do *any* of these things.

In one scene Timothy accidentally scores the winning goal for the opposing team. Instead of consoling the poor boy, the coach just shuns him. Even the parents, who supposedly love Timothy dearly, don't seem to go out of their way to make him feel better. In the same soccer scene, Timothy's father starts screaming (yes, SCREAMING) at his *own* father (Timothy's grandfather), berating him for his lack of emotional support while *he* was growing up. Yeah, that kind of vulnerable, soul-bearing moment happens all the time between two men, in public, at children's soccer games. Another example of terrible writing was the character of Timothy's aunt, who was completely over-the-top in her disparaging of Timothy while bragging up her own children. Kudos to the actors, though, for doing the best they could with such grade school writing.

The writers ruined what could have been a very touching movie. It's as if they wanted each actor to wear a sandwich board saying ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"" throughout the movie so that the stupid audience would be more easily able to keep track of them.",1363478400,,1424,4.9789915966386555

4790948,4,B005LAIIKS,"I enjoyed the film on many levels. As a parent I watched it and thought  it would really be nice to pick the things that we most wanted as a parent and know that life is unpredictable and it would really be totally against mother nature not only to have good but also some of the not so good. We all want the best for our children and it would be very interesting to see a sequel and see what happens to Mr and Mrs Green. Obviously this fantasy and should be treated as such but the film provides a lot of unanswered questions like do dreams rule us? Are we able to deal with what what life throws at us? Should we let all children watch it? Is it perhaps a little dark? I guess yes to the last question but one has top be so careful as one wants only the best for our kids and so maybe we should long and hard. The cast and the crew were good, the film was entertaining and I shall watch it again and ""Timothy"" was not as odd as was implied.",1361145600,,942,3.931937172774869

4791042,2,B005LAIIKS,Boring. Predictable. Boring. Perhaps if TG leaves had hallucinogenic properties more interesting plot lines good have been developed. Maybe I am too critical of mediocrity.,1361059200,,172,5.92
4791043,3,B005LAIIKS,"This movie is a fairy tale with predictable ending but worth watching!

Cindy (Jennifer Gardner) and Jim (Joel Edgerton) cannot have a baby. They are told that this is it! They will never be parents. They go back home and decided to keep believing that one day they will be parents too. They write on several pieces of paper all the characteristics they desire for their child and bury them in the garden in a wooden box. That night, it starts raining (like pouring rain) and a boy (Timothy, played superbly by CJ Adams) appears in their life. And we are in for a parenting fairy tale in the modern world with soccer, music, and bullying and a predictable ending.

This is an OK movie that will keep you busy for about two hours. Still didn't get the message of the movie (if any), but the acting is OK and it is a good story.

Three stars for the direction. However, the story lacks a punchline and some time I have the impression that the actors are overacting. What is the message? Obviously we were supposed to get out of the movie with a message. Not obvious!",1361059200,,1064,4.3908629441624365

The rest of the cast  are mean-spirited this side of South Park. The screenplay is clumsy and unrealistic. In-fact,the way they make a kid is sick,twisted and of course,unrealistic. Frankenstein,Creepy Crawlers,Weird Science and even Milton the Monster had more realistic and sane ways of making people. The only good things about this film are the acting is pretty good and it knows what it wants to say(unlike Drop Dead Fred) but doesn't know how to say it correctly. Like Pagemaster,it's a noble cause but a failed delivery. I give this movie a 1 out of 10.",1360195200,2,679,4.904347826086957
4791307,5,B005LAIIKS,"""Timothy Green"" is the touching story of a loving couple's steadfast desire to have a child.  On the night following the devastating news that they will never conceive a child of their own, something magical happens: Timothy Green comes into their lives with exactly the traits that the couple and the townsfolk need to turn their lives around.

Though bittersweet in the end, the journey is a necessary one for both parents to better understand themselves and what it truly means to be a parent.

There are several laugh-out-loud moments along the way.  The best of which involves an ad hoc family performance of ""low rider.""

I would watch it again. :-)",1360108800,,655,4.8125

4791309,3,B005LAIIKS,"I thought the film would have been more interesting than it was. It's not bad if you have a problem having your own children and live in a fantasy world of ""let's bury our hopes and dreams in a box in the yard and I know we will have our own child."" Like Pinocchio becoming a real boy. It doesn't work that way in the real world and wasn't believable enough for me. Wanda",1360108800,,371,4.027027027027027
4791360,5,B005LAIIKS,"Follows the predictable formula that you can see coming a mile away but if you don't really care and are in the mood for a tear-jerker, this meets the bill (how does one not get upset if anything should happen to a child, regardless of story-line), particularly so if it's cold out and/or rainy.  When a movie is either free or just a couple bucks it has to be pretty awful to decry it.  If I paid 8 bucks at the cinema, I'm not sure I'd be advocating a watch -- but it was raining and the movie was free, so why not.  Enjoy.",1360022400,,525,4.028846153846154
4791361,5,B005LAIIKS,This was a great movie. The kids and I enjoyed it a lot. It is a little different but the previews do it justice so watch the preview first to see if you will like it.

4791362,4,B005LAIIKS,"Overall pretty good movie. I didn't like the way it ended though. Regarding the service. I was able to play the move from amazon without a hitch. No glitches. Played very well. As good as...if not better than netflix. We watched another movie as well...same thing. So, if you are worried about whether or not you have trouble playing it....no need to worry~!

Finally you have the moral of redemption in the life of this spectacular boy.  His life while short by some measurements, is as full as ten lifetimes.  He teaches both respect, humility, acceptance and finally unconditional love.

It just left us with the feeling that something was missing, maybe a little more ""unforeseeableness"" would have helped. We do think the kid who played the main character was great, and there are no doubt some very nice and touching moments. I would recommend this for a rainy afternoon when the mission is to find something antertaining for the whole family.

4792103,5,B005LAIIKS,"Amazing. Inspiring. It really astounded me, the beauty of Human Creativity. To come up with a movie that questions and gives different perspectives, of Love, Loss, Ignorance, Fear of The Unknown. throughout the movie it was subtle, but one could catch the images and moments when the director and writer of this beautiful film weaved many instances where Love was formed, where it comes from, is there really any length or boundaries for it? Showed the small ignorance and greed of selfishness, and the fabrication of unhappiness that stems from not looking up once in awhile and taking in a deep breath and relaxing, and enjoying the gift of Life. Timothy was the kid who anybody could easily fall in love with, he was cute, adorable, intelligent, creative, inspiring and has a heart of gold that transcended his physical body. The story of his leaves were beautiful. It really made me think, and brought me to tears when that instance of never take for granted what you are given, because it can easily be taken from you.. but only because it i meant to be. That scene. Heart-warming, and Heart-breaking at the same time, where it made you think about Life. It made you think about Love. The essence of one's own Happiness. And the journey for one's own pursuit of Happiness. Timothy was so strong for his parents, that moment when the story unfolded even more, about the beautiful significance of his leaves. Flawless. The Odd Life of Timothy Green is a beautiful story of Hope, Love, Forgiveness, Compassion, and Second Chances.",1359158400,,1532,4.828897338403042

4792190,3,B005LAIIKS,The Odd Life of Timothy Green: slow-moving- wanted to fast-forward; was not believable-too far-fetched; I didn't like the way it ended-it was kind of sad in a way.,1359072000,,163,4.857142857142857
4792191,4,B005LAIIKS,"This movie left me wondering if I should have gotten this. It seems a little far fetched yet with possibilities: come on everyone knows you do not grow kids from your garden right?

This is one of those movies I had now watched several times; it seems to grow on you almost like leafs on a tree.",1359072000,,295,4.175438596491228
4792192,5,B005LAIIKS,"It is a heartwarming and humerous movie and I recommend it. for most age groups.  The movie has

4792194,5,B005LAIIKS,I like an inspirational film that features the underdog. Why are 11 more words required? Writing these reviews is very taxing.,1358985600,,126,5.0476190476190474

4792258,5,B005LAIIKS,"Good movie, touches on the struggles of couples not able to conceive on their own. Cute in the way that they got the exact child they wanted just by wishing.. I enjoy watching Jennifer Garner she's a very versatile actress",1358899200,,222,4.575

4792260,3,B005LAIIKS,"I was looking forward to this movie since it's been in the movie theaters. However, I was glad I didn't spend the money to watch it in the movie theater. It had a few likeable parts but it was just okay.",1358899200,,203,3.975609756097561

4792262,5,B005LAIIKS,We enjoyed this movie - you have to have a little bit of willing suspension of disbelief - but it is really touching.  Even my 7 and 9 year old enjoyed it despite a little more adult theme of not being able to have children of your own.,1358899200,,236,3.9166666666666665
4792263,4,B005LAIIKS,"A coming of age story for adults that aren't quite ready for parenthood through adoption, but realize they are ready after they find a boy that appears to be from their garden.",1358899200,,176,4.53125
4792361,5,B005LAIIKS,The Odd Life of Timothy Green is one of those movies that makes you cry like a baby. The entires story will touch your heart.,1358899200,,125,4.04
4792362,3,B005LAIIKS,"I went into this with no more info than the Amazon description. My 3 might be a bit deceptive, it was an enjoyable family movie with no shoot'em up, fung-fu, swearing, and not even many dirty looks much less anything dirty unless you count the muddy kid near the start.

The movie starts with a couple that can't have a baby hearing the news from the doctors that having kids is just not going to happen. On that sad new the couple decide to write down the qualities their kid would have if they had one and the movie magic begins. The movie is told after the fact as a story to child adoption case workers and the couple trying to explain their qualifications for adoption.

This is sort of Kyle XY & Phenomenon meets Richie Cunningham, and Happy Days is what sticks, in fact, I might say watching this is like 3-4 episodes of Happy Days the TV show back-to-back.

The movie does not even attempt to tie up loose ends, tackle obvious questions, like how does an 8 year old show up and no one questions where he came from, they just sort of glaze over that part.

So in the end this is a feel good movie that will be on the Hallmark Channel in a short while, for most I would say wait for the TV movie to come out, however, if you are looking for a break from the kill everything in sight movies, just want to relax with the family and see an enjoyable albiet sappy flick, this is a good choice.",1358899200,5,1395,4.1940298507462686

4792367,3,B005LAIIKS,"The Odd Life is a Hollywoody feel-good fantasy piece. It is a bit formulaic and self-conscious, but I liked it anyway.",1358812800,,118,4.666666666666667
4792368,3,B005LAIIKS,"I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing that the music stands out (or sticks out) in this movie. It ran noticeably through the film. It's a real hum-along, whistle-along, toe-tapping, ""easy listening"" kind of tune. I say ""maybe not a good thing"" because it was more noticeable and entertaining than the movie. I'm a little surprised this tale was told in movie form. To me it occurred as more of an idea for a story rather than a full blown story. Its ""quirky"" foundation either isn't great or quirky or odd enough, me thinks. It's fine to watch in that it keeps your interest and is not boring. It's just really not that special. Or maybe, it's really just not that ODD!",1358812800,,680,4.362204724409449

4792449,3,B005LAIIKS,My wife and I enjoyed this movie just because it was such a break from the norm.  It was a sentimental look at a childless married couple hungry for kids.  The movie has a sweet end.,1358726400,,182,4.027777777777778
4792450,2,B005LAIIKS,"Would not have bought this movie if I would have seen it first...poignant, yes, but nothing really new, a bit ""weak"" I guess I would say.

4792523,4,B005LAIIKS,"This was a great movie.  Well acted.  It's a little far fetched, but if you get past that and watch the movie for pure entertament, you will really enjoy it.

You watch as a married couple become a family and they watch all their dreams come true.  You watch how a father and son become just a little bit closer.

A great move to watch with your children.",1358726400,,355,4.161764705882353

4792528,4,B005LAIIKS,"Okay, this movie is probably not a close fit for my age group and it required a whole lot of suspension of disbelief, but I enjoyed it and felt satisfied (and a little teary-eyed) at the end.  Even so, there were some weaknesses in the plot development and missed opportunities for some interesting side plots but, oddly, the writers somehow forgot to consult with me before finalizing the script.",1358640000,,397,4.753623188405797

4792616,5,B005LAIIKS,"We enjoyed this movie.  It's a little far fetched but we found ourselves caught up in that fantacy.  It's about a couple who are unable to conceive.  One night they bury their wishes for a child and the traits he would have.  The same night there is a storm and a boy shows up in their house.  Supposedly he has sprung from the garden.  They have only a season to enjoy him, but none of them are aware of this until the end.  I find the main characters were well cast and the story line enjoyable.  Recommended.",1358553600,,511,4.195876288659794

4792740,3,B005LAIIKS,"Not a blockbuster, but a cute fairytale movie.  I watched just after the Sandy Hook tragedy, which was not intentional.

4792744,3,B005LAIIKS,I rented it with my kids. They thought it was OK. I did not like it. The story was strange. Not a lot of character development. Predictable. I expected more from this movie.,1358467200,,173,4.2727272727272725
4792745,5,B005LAIIKS,Its interesting and a good clean movie the whole family can watch together!!!  My 16 year old granddaughter cried through most of it.,1358467200,,133,4.782608695652174
4792746,3,B005LAIIKS,Thought this movie was entertaining but kind of slow moving. Watched with my daughter and son-in-law and they agreed. Wish I had rented it vs buying it.,1358380800,,152,4.666666666666667

4793127,4,B005LAIIKS,"I will start by saying, I am not a cryer. This movie, however, really struck a nerve in me. I am a huge fan of Disney Movies, and when I saw the commercials, I knew I had to see it. So I sat down and watched it. In my opinion, it could have been a bit longer, thus the movie was a bit choppy, and Disney could have expanded the details on some of the minor characters, my reasoning for deducting the one star (I am such a critic). The movie overall was touching and sweet and a great family movie. But make sure to keep at least two tissue boxes within arms reach. I gave this movie four stars because it takes a lot to make me cry, and kudos for that Disney.",1358035200,,659,3.925373134328358

4793425,4,B005LAIIKS,My family and I saw this movie together.  It is a safe family movie with a positive message that leave you feeling good and optimistic.

4793692,3,B005LAIIKS,Totally lovable little Timothy with totally believable parenting is well acted and entertaining.  There is a tremendous stretch of the imagination teamed with such raw reality in the film which makes the required stretch a bit much.  The acting overcomes the demands on the imagination for a good while but it gets tough about midway.  Watched with ten and twelve year olds and they struggled with the story too.,1357603200,,412,4.942028985507246

The movie is very good, but not great in my opinion. I feel that there were a few scenes that were overly cheesy. The film emphasizes acceptance, perseverance, and maintaining a positive attitude though the experiences of Timothy Green and his parents.

You feel good and appreciate your life more after seeing this film.

The make a list of character traits their child would have had, place the list in a box, and bury it in the garden. That night a little boy comes to them out of the garden...

4793844,3,B005LAIIKS,"I would recommend the movie. It is an entertaining story line and it is a good clean movie.  Very suitable for kids of all ages.

What I did not like was the quality of the movie through Amazon.  We typically use another company but decided to try Amazon for this movie.  It was more expensive on a per movie basis and the quality was not good.  There were parts that were very blurry and it actually locked up several times.  I am unsure of whether I'll use the service again.",1357516800,,477,4.2444444444444445
4793845,3,B005LAIIKS,"Watched it with a lady of my acquaintance and her mother on New Years' Eve. It was not my choice. That said, the movie was tolerable if - since it's a Disney product- one can suspend the unbelief sufficiently to permit the possibility of a child being produced by planting a box in a garden.  That alone might give sex education teachers nightmares.
  Prejudices aside, the story was entertaining, if for no other reason than it provided opportunity for me to work out my ""Mystery Science 3000"" gene. I admit loving to ruin movies like this with side comments, which, I might add, is not always the best way to ingratiate oneself with those who might be watching it with you.
  Recommend it? Yeah, sort of, if you like contrived, overworked emotional plots. If you enjoy 'chick flicks', if kids who grow leaves on their legs are your sort of thing, then this movie's for you. Otherwise, watch it with some friends who have an irreverent sense of humor.",1357516800,,952,4.609467455621302

Seriously, if you value good cinema don't waste your money.",1357430400,3,348,5.388888888888889

Although the main character was sweet and there was a nice sentiment involved in his passing out his leaves, the story was somewhat lacking and the ending was insignificant.  The best thing about it was that it was that it would be okay for the whole family, a rare movie type these days.",1357257600,,444,4.325301204819277

4794087,1,B005LAIIKS,"This movie was an eye rolling, annoying experience.  As an adoptive parent, I was especially insulted by the idea that for this couple to arrive at the idea of creating a family through adoption, they had to have this bizarre, supernatural experience of literally having a ""home grown"" kid first.  It had such an unbelievable plot and pathetic dialogue, and weak characters.  It was so bad that I had to watch until the end to see if it could somehow redeem itself.  This was the biggest waste of Disney dollars I've ever encountered, and I'm not sure how such a weak story made it to the point of wasting millions of dollars to make a weak movie.  The only redeeming quality I could find was it was visually beautiful, but even that does not make it worth your time.",1357171200,6,767,4.489208633093525

4794089,2,B005LAIIKS,"I remember the first time I saw a trailer for ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green."" My eyes rolled so many times I think I actually lost balance. However, at my wife's request we sat down and watched it on Blu-ray. I held on to the hope that this would be one of those films I ended up enjoying when the credits rolled at the end. It wasn't nearly as painful as I thought it would be. The movie still felt like it was missing something in the end, though.

A happily married couple who long to start a family find out they are unable to have children. After they bury a wish list of what traits they would want their imaginary child ""Timothy"" to have, they awaken in the middle of the night to find a boy on their doorstep. As Timothy is introduced to the townspeople of Stanleyville, wonderful things begin happening that can only point to his arrival.

Writer / director Peter Hedges constructed a touching film on the surface. It's only when you dig deeper into ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" that you get the feeling there should be more of a reason for the movie to exist. I found myself dreading the end because it was all too obvious how it was going to pan out. The conclusion left both my wife and I with a sensation of dissatisfaction. This is what I would call a ""feel good"" movie that doesn't leave you feeling so great.

The high-definition transfer for the Blu-ray version of the movie looks and sounds wonderful. All the beautiful colors of fall jump out of the screen at viewers. The 5.1 surround sound mix delivers a great balance of dialogue, musical score, and sound effects. You feel immersed in rustling leaves, crashing thunder, raindrops, and other sounds of nature throughout.

Bonus material for the Blu-ray edition includes audio commentary by director / writer Peter Hedges. There are also two featurettes entitled ""This is Family"" and ""The Gift of Music."" We also get five deleted scenes with optional commentary from Peter Hedges. A music video for ""This Gift,"" performed by Glen Hansard, Marketa Irglova and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus, is featured as well.

""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" tries very hard to give viewers an emotional and entertaining experience. An unsatisfying finale is likely to ruin it for most audiences. It's a shame because the first 95-minutes promise a favorable film that isn't granted.",1357171200,2,2339,4.640096618357488

I even caught my teenager shedding a tear at the end.  Only one concern:  some of the scenes were quite dark--not in the figural sense.  Literally, the movie was filmed without a lot of light in some scenes.  I'm sure this was for dramatic effect, but it was difficult for ""old"" eyes to see what was going on in certain shots.

The acting was good, the dialogue great, and the movie flowed nicely.  I won't get into too much detail about the plot for fear of ruining it, but I really liked the concept it.

4794284,5,B005LAIIKS,"I love those movies that make you smile through tears.  While this movie was not quite the Steel Magnolia's of bitter sweet, it was surely a must see if you love kids.  From the beginning you know where the story is going but it walks you there gently and compassionately.  And the message I took from the movie really fit my opinions on adoption and raising kids in general.  If, while you're teaching children the things you find important, you allow yourself to learn from them, the world would be a better place.",1357084800,,516,4.516129032258065

Speaking of likeable, the kid that plays Timothy (what a doll!) he was great!!  I digress.  So, this is a really cute family movie about adoption and family - with a disney style twist of course (I can't remember if this is by Disney or not.)  A little bit of magic and clean livin' and dreams are coming true all over the place.  A touch of saddness at the end, but it's expected so there's no real shock.

4794665,3,B005LAIIKS,Was kind of a strange movie but was cute too. Not my favorite. I wondered about the movie so now I know.,1356912000,,104,3.772727272727273
4794666,2,B005LAIIKS,"My wife and I rented this movie thinking it would be an emotional movie.  There was so little characterization of Timothy that the viewer doesn't really get attached to him.  He seems to be something of a robot.  As a result when big emotional moments come it's hard to really feel strongly.  In short, no tears are jerked in this particular tear jerker.",1356912000,,354,4.571428571428571
4794667,5,B005LAIIKS,"Excellent movie to watch with your kids. Suspend reality, sit back and enjoy!  You will never look at a leaf the same.",1356912000,,118,4.363636363636363
4794668,4,B005LAIIKS,I like Jennifer Garner and she was a big draw for me to check out this movie.  The trailers when it first came out also seemed interesting to me.  It was well worth watching with a message of hope and redemption.  It has a bitter sweet ending and is a bit of a tear jerker.  I am pleased that I took the time to watch this movie.,1356912000,,329,3.8656716417910446
4794669,2,B005LAIIKS,"I was so hoping this would be whimsical and sweet, like my favorite movie, Big Fish. Instead it is choppy, and leads to many "" whaaat?"" moments. You could drive a semi through the plot, and I usually am ok with the willing suspension of disbelief. The weird girlfriend who tries to kiss ( ewww this kid is like, 8 ) Timothy is just creepy. No info is offered about her, as a matter of fact few characters are at all likeable. Jen Garner tries very hard, and she is the only glimmer of ok here. so sad, this movie could have rocked. Save yourself some cash, don't bother.",1356912000,,570,4.238532110091743
4794670,2,B005LAIIKS,Yes the movie has a solid message and really gets you at the end but it just seemed to be missing something to make you care about the characters more.  I don't know if it was the format of them telling the story or just the arbitrary feeling to the people he helped or the common stereotypes used.  But it lacked something to truly pull you into the story and characters.,1356912000,,372,4.225352112676056
4794671,5,B005LAIIKS,This is a great family movie with a heartwarming message about the gifts we all possess.  Everyone loved it including Dad!,1356825600,,122,4.809523809523809

4794724,5,B005LAIIKS,Really enjoyed the movie. But the Picture quality was terrible. It was like watching a movie on Dish satellite. blurry images. Not worth the extra money for sure.,1356825600,,162,4.821428571428571
4794725,3,B005LAIIKS,"I thought this was a great premise for a movie and the preview made me want to rent it.  However, I didn't learn anything from watching the movie that I hadn't seen in that free preview.  I still never understood who they were telling the story to and for what purpose.  I also wished they would have developed the purpose of the leaves a bit more.  I felt like the directors got to the end of the movie and wanted to wrap it up quickly.  I was left feeling a little incomplete after watching this one.  Normally, I suggest waiting until it comes out on video; with this one wait until you can see it for free on TV.",1356825600,,616,4.1344537815126055

4794729,5,B005LAIIKS,"The Odd Life Of Timothy Green was a great, clean movie that showed good family values.

Timothy Green delivers to you its message and teaches you and your family

4794855,5,B005LAIIKS,Thoughtful movie for both children and adults. Young granddaughters and grandsons learned from it and the adults both enjoyed and learned life lessons.,1356825600,,151,5.608695652173913
4794856,4,B005LAIIKS,"I am not going to repeat what other reviewers have said.  It is a feel good movie.

Here's where I believe the movie shines. It is in the message, ""all things must die"".  A young child's common first, real connection with death is the loss of a pet. For a child, that can be very traumatic.  I believe this movie, when watched with parents, can help present a message of dealing with loss in a caring and compassionate way.

I also believe the movie would be of value to children who feel, real or perceived, they are ""different"" or awkward.  There too is a great message of love, acceptance and perseverance over just trying to fit it.

While this is not a genre of movies I would watch, the family wanted to see this one.  We did and I'm glad we did.",1356825600,,752,4.246478873239437

4794859,5,B005LAIIKS,"Ordered this movie via Amazon and watched it in the comfort of my home last night. Have a great Surround Sound System and it was really nice to get into all the emotions this film brings. Firstly, Jennifer Garner is a tremendous actress without any public outrageous drama, making her believable in all the roles she appears in.
The movie is a combination of deep wishful thinking/dreaming, opening doors to heal matters of the heart, some light humor and a tear jerking ending filled with bliss and joy. It is a movie for the entire family to watch, nothing is too surreal or far fetched that can't be shared or enjoyed for children, tweens, teens and adults. Loved this delightful film. Bravo!",1356739200,,695,4.704918032786885

4794967,3,B005LAIIKS,"It was a movie that seemed to miss its mark.  The whole segment about the older girl and their colorful creation didn't quite make sense or perhaps I just didn't ""get it"".  The relationship wasn't quite believable.  Sometimes I felt that the transitions were too abrupt.  Overall, I did watch it to the end, but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.",1356739200,,348,4.564516129032258

So last night I viewed it and it made me cry it was so amazing. It is predictable and heart-warming..but it made me, a 26 old guy cry! The story to me reaches deeper than what is seen on the outside.

4795520,1,B005LAIIKS,"I thought this might be a cute dramedy, but it was more of a horribly embarrassing movie to watch.  I kept thinking it has to get better yet it was just plan awful from the beginning to the end...I wish I did not pay to rent this...",1356307200,6,232,3.9361702127659575

4795842,5,B005LAIIKS,Parents could relate to this story that have had issues surrounding wanting to have children.  The story was a surprise at the end.,1356307200,,131,4.695652173913044
4795843,5,B005LAIIKS,"Every now and then I go to the big screen to match a movie and enjoy the high price, artery clogging, over salted, popcorn and watch a movie. This should have been included on that list. Great family movie with happy ending.",1356307200,,224,4.357142857142857

We use a Logitech Revue with Linksys E4200 router, both of which we rebooted but the problem persisted leading me to believe it was on Amazon's end. We have before & since streamed video from other sources with NO problems.",1356220800,,344,4.655737704918033

4795850,4,B005LAIIKS,"Cute little break from reality with a kind of tree of life message. Nice change from some of the mindless garbage we are otherwise subjected to, like ""this is 40"" that I saw last night!",1356220800,,185,4.314285714285714
4795851,4,B005LAIIKS,"4 kids and I enjoyed it! I would recommend a nice enjoyable evening family movie,  quite imaginative and very different!",1356220800,,120,5.0
4795932,2,B005LAIIKS,"This movie is trying really hard to be that kind of movie that mixes whimsy and real emotion to create something meaningful. But it's forced and it fails, it's also slow and repetitive. The story fails to really ever draw the audience in, things that were clearly meant to be good moments are tacked on and don't mesh with anything that happens before or after, and the acting is unconvincing.",1356134400,,393,4.628571428571429
4795933,5,B005LAIIKS,"This was a very exciting and touching movie. We really enjoyed it as a family, Nice to have family movies rather than violent one",1356134400,,129,4.416666666666667

4795935,5,B005LAIIKS,As an adoptive and foster parent it demonstrates the heart and desire to parent. We all want to be good parents and are guily of over doing it. Lots of good heart warming humor.,1356134400,,177,4.235294117647059
4795936,5,B005LAIIKS,This story is so sweet your blood sugar will go up just by watching it. A new Christmas favorite! Great movie for kids and adults alike.,1356134400,,136,4.269230769230769

4795938,4,B005LAIIKS,"I enjoyed this movie. It had a simple and sweet message to be kind and appreciate the differences in people. It made me smile. The little boy was adorable and I enjoyed the movie. A ""feel good"" movie for sure.",1356134400,,209,4.25
4795939,4,B005LAIIKS,"We rented this as out ""Family Movie Night"" It was a touching tale. A bit slow for our 9 year old but he seemed able to keep up with the plot. An impressive storyline that while far fetched, was shown in a plausible fashion. Great family movie.",1356134400,2,243,4.191489361702128

4796112,4,B005LAIIKS,Unique and imaginative. Puts one in touch with their feelings and gives hope perhaps to couples struggling with trying to have a family.,1356048000,,136,4.956521739130435
4796113,4,B005LAIIKS,"Lite, cute family film. Fantasy with an adorable premise. Those struggling with getting pregnant will certainly enjoy the story line.",1356048000,,133,5.7
4796114,2,B005LAIIKS,"Unfortunately, this film fails to make the fantastical notion of a pre-teen boy emerging from a backyard garden to teach two childless thirty-somethings all they need to know about qualifying as adoptive parents entertaining or enlightening. Never really develops either a sense of magic or invites our willingness to ""suspend disbelief.""

The amazed parents are mostly irritating in their efforts to understand and protect this child as he interacts with his disciplined, highly motivated, over achieving cousins and their driven mother, his bullying school chums, a cold apparently ""old maid"" town matron, or a skeptical soccer coach. The movie exhibits a better touch in the subplot of the ""budding"" Timothy and a prospective candidate for his first crush. I never really understood how he managed to actually motivate any changes to his various antagonists.

For the record I am generally not irritated by this type of movie and wanted Timothy's ""odd life"" to be so much more.",1356048000,,980,5.235668789808917
4796115,5,B005LAIIKS,Watched it with my 8 year old daughter and we both laughed and cried.  A very moving movie with a happy ending.,1356048000,,111,4.045454545454546

4796119,4,B005LAIIKS,It was nice and funny but weird.i watched it two times.i thought the weird part was that he had leafs.,1355961600,,102,4.15
4796120,4,B005LAIIKS,Great little movie but would not recommend it for young kids.  Many important moral lessons but you know the ending which still didn't stop it from being a tear jerker.,1355961600,,168,4.6
4796121,3,B005LAIIKS,"It was entertaining and very cute.  Nothing to write home about, however, I did enjoy it.  Would not rent it again.",1355961600,,115,4.428571428571429
4796211,4,B005LAIIKS,"It was a sweet movie. But the fact that all the people that met Timothy didn't even question or blink that he just ""appeared"" one day was a little surprising I guess. In a perfect world...",1355961600,,188,4.25
4796212,4,B005LAIIKS,"Several of my girlfriends were here for the Christmas holiday and we chose to watch this movie that touched all of our hearts, and of course, we all love Jennifer Garner!  Great job Peter Hedges!",1355961600,,195,4.571428571428571

4796216,3,B005LAIIKS,It was just an OK movie.  Not sure it was worth the money spent to watch it.  I guess I was really bored.,1355961600,,105,3.5217391304347827
4796217,5,B005LAIIKS,"Fictional and imaginative.  Covers adoption, imperfect parenting is ok, and being different is ok, among other things.  The ending is rocky for children, my boys are 5 and 8.  We watched it with them and we all shed tears.  It gave mom and me chances to talk about things that most movies do not give families to talk about.  If you do not want to have a lot of why questions from your little ones do not set them in front of this movie.  Yes the whole premise is make believe but there is a lot of needed commentary from a parent so watch it with them.",1355961600,,553,4.121495327102804

4796219,4,B005LAIIKS,"Chose high ranking because I liked movie and my wife really like it. Hard to find a movie we both enjoy, she does not like violent or dark drama, I don't like movie remakes of ""Friends"" TV show.",1355961600,,194,4.131578947368421
4796220,3,B005LAIIKS,"Cute Movie! This movie was cute but just too unbelievable! There are no parents that are so ""ignorant"" to believe their child grew in a garden. Must have been a low budget film! Happy I didn't I didn't watch before buying DVD.",1355961600,,226,4.404761904761905

4796402,5,B005LAIIKS,This was such a cute family movie.  Everyone from adults to my 8 year old was mesmerized by this tale,1355961600,,101,4.05
4796403,3,B005LAIIKS,"Corny. The kids enjoyed it. As for me, not so much. I guess I could say its a movie you watch before you watch the ""real movie"".  You know, an appetizer. Haha.",1355961600,2,159,3.96875
4796404,3,B005LAIIKS,"This is a nice feel-good movie. If you're looking for something to occupy your time and mind for a short while that will leave you with a positive feeling, this is it. There's nothing negative or off-color, and the acting and direction are good enough that you can suspend disbelief long enough to accept that premise of the story. You won't regret the time you've spent watching this. You also won't learn anything or see anything that you would expect to see in real life, but isn't that why we watch movies anyway?",1355961600,8,517,4.56989247311828

4796406,4,B005LAIIKS,I really enjoyed this movie. It is a good feel kind of movie. Kind of sad but not. A happy ending is always nice.,1355961600,,113,3.75
4796407,5,B005LAIIKS,"What an awesome movie made to inspire and warm the soul. We'd all appreciate someone saving us from a horrible movie, so trust that this is not one to be saved from or avoid.

4796552,2,B005LAIIKS,"I watched this fantasy film with a house guest who raved about it and said I ""Just had to see it!""  But I squirmed uncomfortably throughout, trying to suspend my disbelief as this infertile couple who become the instant parents of this ""garden child"" struggle to explain their unlikely story to a couple of stern unsympathetic adoption agency bureaucrats. I waited in vain for something profound to take away from it as it wound down to its predictable conclusion.",1355875200,,464,4.8734177215189876

4796753,4,B005LAIIKS,"While I think quite a bit more could have been done with this movie given it's sci-fi/fantasy story line, it was still good all around family fare.  The cast did a believable job and kept the script entertaining.  As empty nesters, we still appreciate quality family films and usually watch those that throw other genres in the mix such as the addition of fantasy in this one.  We will most definitely watch this again when the grandkids visit.",1355875200,,444,4.666666666666667

4796757,4,B005LAIIKS,"I had read many reviews for Timothy and well followed all pre- release information available before its release and was more than eager to finally see it.
Many said it was too sappy, I say..it wasn't sappy enough. Everytime you wanted to care it was almost as if they pulled back, sort of like why didn't Lassie ever  kiss Timmy?  Why was that; dog too good, boy too bad or the  trainer didn't allow?  Watch the original with Roddy McDowell, rip your guts out but that damn dog didn't kiss, (lick) Roddy once, wasn't he deserving of that love?

 That's what I felt watching this you wanted to love 'Timothy', you wanted him to be their dream child and for them to have him forever but at every turn it was like don't care too much, don't become attached to him and what was up with that soccer game? If it wasn't for that girl caring for him I'd have thought the beauty of Timothy's surprise appearance had been totally wasted on those to who he appeared.
 I knew when the leaves started falling we were going to lose him, and the tale of how his leaves were given and to whom was one of the sweetest parts of the movie; you saw Timothy's heart there.
 You'll  have to watch this yourself and maybe you won't feel deprived of what could have been but I'll tell you this; that little wonder who played Timothy, I hope the next director who works with him lets him fly and fly right.",1355875200,2,1381,4.301158301158301

4797087,5,B005LAIIKS,"This movie is a poignant reminder that life is precious and to be very thankful for the people you love in your life. It was worthwhile and touching although not necessarily a ""kids"" movie.  That isn't a bad thing though.

My oldest child, nearly 9, was sad after this movie.  He had a hard time going to bed and is actually falling asleep in my bed as I type. He is the sensitive type though and is deeply affected by other people's pain.  The couple in the movie that were unable to conceive their own child showed a lot of emotion and heartbreak in this movie.  There were plenty of funny and touching parts as well.  There is a death of an older family member.  While there is nothing in this movie that is offensive, sensitive persons may be saddened by it somewhat.  That said, I will recommend it to most anyone.

My younger children, ages 7 and 5, were completely fine and able to go to bed without an issue.  It might be too much for anyone feeling raw from infertility issues however, so keep that in mind.  (The movie UP was very upsetting to me on some levels because the couple had issues conceiving and I had been through similar pain however, I still love that movie.)",1355529600,,1183,4.3561643835616435

4797089,2,B005LAIIKS,"This film was really boring.  A kid sprouts from a couple's garden and has leaves on his legs.  There is no magic or symbolism to these leaves or moral to the story.  The movie pretty much goes on and on with the kid in soccer games, drawing portraits or playing musical instruments at a recital.  There is really no climax or thrilling aspects to this film and thus it becomes a bore really fast.  I think I might have been expecting too much from this film since Jennifer Garner is in it and it was under the Disney name.  I should have passed on it nonetheless.",1355443200,2,564,4.273584905660377
4797090,4,B005LAIIKS,"Director Peter Hedges wanted to make a movie like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" the kind of film that people take into their hearts. In the case of ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green,"" he may have succeeded as time proves its value and it touches more lives through Blu-ray and DVD.

For the time being, I'm sure audiences were as perplexed as I was when I saw the trailers. Even as the movie, my wife and I were intrigued but still disconcerted (""Really? A pencil factory?"")

But as we watched we were very drawn into this very simple, elegantly presented story -- gorgeously filmed in Georgia (though in the audio commentary --THANK YOU -- the director admits there were some leaves added to trees for some shots.)

We have had our own issues in child bearing, as have our friends, and had we lost a child through tragedy or illness, ""Timothy Green"" might be hard to enjoy. It is no spoiler that Timothy's visit is temporary -- it's telegraphed constantly throughout the film, but the departure is not as maudlin as it might have been under less skillful hands. It's bittersweet but enriched with hope and growth.

It's also filled with gentle humor and superb performances by Jennifer Garner, Australian actor Joel Edgerton, the always-great Dianne Wiest and Ron Livingston (who seems to be aging into Joe ""Joey Zaza"" Mantegna. This is definitely worth seeing.

Everyone may come away with a different impression, depending on their relationship with their parents, siblings and chlldbirth experiences. I found it similar to Walt Disney's ""Pollyanna"" in the sense that one person can, in their small way, have a profound effect on people.

""It's a Wonderful Life"" was not a box office bonanza when it was first released. It's premise, though we've now seen dozens of knock-offs since, was probably strange to theatergoers back in the '40s. Maybe the time will come for the Greens just as it did for the Baiieys.",1355443200,,1905,4.7926829268292686

I liked his ""parents,"" and related to their protectiveness, their awe at this boy's existence (I often feel that way about my own kids).

4797403,3,B005LAIIKS,"""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" depends less on computer-generated special effects and elaborately staged action sequences to draw in viewers, with its fantasy involving average folks in familiar settings.  No castles, Death Stars, or Quidditch tournaments, just a gentle story told effectively.

A happily married childless couple, Cindy and Jim Green (Jennifer Garner, Joel Edgerton) become frustrated with their inability to conceive, so one night they dream up their ideal offspring and write the child's characteristics and life events on pieces of paper.  They place the notes in a box and bury it in their backyard.  One stormy night, a muddy ten-year-old arrives at their doorstep, claiming the Greens as his own.  Cindy and Jim, along with their small town of Stanleyville, learn that sometimes the unexpected can bring some of life's greatest gifts.

""He's a boy with the qualities that his parents hope for,"" says director Peter Hedges, but ""those qualities manifest in ways they never could have imagined.""  The Greens get exactly what they wished for.  Timothy doesn't have any emotional memories and he's completely naive about how the world works.

The title role puts spotlight on young actor CJ Adams, whom Hedges cast in 2007's ""Dan In Real Life.""  What initially appears to be a kids' film isn't actually about childhood.  It's more a fable about the sadness of infertility and the joy of parenthood with its accompanying highs and lows.  It often veers into saccharine sentimentality, but is well-intentioned at heart.

The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack's bonus extras include deleted scenes, director's commentary, a making-of featurette, and the music video ""This Gift.""  The movie is also available as a single-disc DVD.",1355270400,2,1745,5.27536231884058
4797404,1,B005LAIIKS,"The Odd life of Timothy Green(released Aug/12)stars Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton as the Green family. What I thought would be,as the movie started to unfold,an eclectic idea that would blossom into something special,unfortunately turned into a 100 minute yawn fest. The only other thing I can compare watching this film to is watching paint dry on a wet and damp day. It is that much fun....no,pardon me,it is totally BORING!A snail on Prozac could beat this movies pace in a heartbeat.
The story involves the Greens(much too obvious,don`t you think)and their unsuccessful efforts to produce children. The couple attend an adoption agency and the story unfolds as they tell their strange tale to the two people sitting in front of them. After a frustrating and disappointing time with their fertility doctor,the couple return home. The couple start making post-it notes as to how they would want their imaginary child to be like. They put them all into a wooden box,which they plant in their garden. That night it rains terribly hard(and,as we learn later,only on their property)and while in bed an intruder enters the house. They search and find a dirt covered 10 year old in what would have been their nursery had they had a child. Voila,instant family.
The only boys name in the box they planted was Timothy,so that is what he's called. He is introduced as an adopted child to their family. Timothy has several leaves growing out of the bottom of his legs,which the parents keep covered at all times,lest people start asking questions about...his roots(sorry).The Green's aren't perfect parents by any means and wing alot of their parental actions,but they mean well. They love Timothy and he loves them. Timothy starts a relationship with a girl a little older than him and an outcast in her own right,as she sports a blood coloured birth mark on her right front shoulder area.
As the film progresses Timothy starts to slowly lose leaves off of his leg. Eventually autumn comes and Tim first breaks the news of his impending departure to his girlfriend. Comes one night Timothy must finally leave for good. As dawn breaks the next day in comes the adoption agency with the Green`s newly adopted daughter,and now they can start a life long commitment with a real child.
The film is so agonizingly slow that it never gets one interested in its plot at all. It meanders from one thing to another in such a leisurely manner that before you know it you are clock watching within just a few minutes of its start. I cannot imagine anyone 12 and under sitting still for 100 minutes to watch this. It rules out teenagers also and older adults...well that's problematic at best. I cannot think of a single movie in recent memory that has had me so disinterested in its plot so fast as this.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a music video and deleted scenes.
All in all this is a family yawn fest of humungous proportions,that is,as  Peter Noone might musically muse,a must to avoid. The meandering plot will have you looking at your watch quicker than you can say ""pass the grey poupon"".Zzzzzzzz.",1355270400,13,3159,4.796330275229358

There are no surprises here, though. Everyone's emotional processes and reactions are quite predictable. As delightful as the story is, and as adequate the acting, the film leaves you with a faux sense of fullness like Chinese food.

CJ Adams does an excellent job at portraying Timothy. Jennifer Garner as the mother skips along the surface of the role, and Joel Edgerton as the father is okay.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is one of those films where you just want to get lost in the fantasy world and just believe that special things can happen to a family.

A film where you just don't want to over-analyze and just take things as they are.  No asking questions of how a boy can materialize from a box of notes planted in the back yard or how a child has leaves growing out of his legs, don't think too deeply about the fantasy elements.  Just enjoy this film for how a young boy is able to help a distraught couple, who are unable to have children but manage to have this one boy, Timothy, come into their lives and not only change their life but also touch the lives of others.

I was touched by this film because as a father, I know how it was for me and my wife to try and have a child.  To think of how people around us had no problems but yet, each time we tried, things were not meant to be.  And just the emotions we had at the time, I can sympathize of the pain that both characters, Cindy and Jim are feeling.

Both Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton did a fantastic job of playing the couple who suddenly have a new boy and experiencing all these new emotions of being parents.  Being a parent is an enjoyable but it can also be a frustrating experience (and many other emotions that one can easily feel), but for those wanting children, especially earlier on, you just have to adjust.  And it's interesting to see both characters grow in this short time with Timothy.

Child actor CJ Adams also did a fine job of playing Timothy Green.  A character that is also trying to adjust to his new surrounding but also knows that his time is short.  And when you start seeing Timothy lose his leaves, you know that this happiness is going to be short-lived (so be prepared to shed some tears).

But ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is also about hope. Timothy touches the life of people in different ways and we get to see how he touches those lives throughout the film.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture and audio quality are very good.  Warm colors and dialogue is crystal clear.  There are several special features included and because this is a family film, it will be released with both the Blu-ray and DVD versions of the film.

Overall, ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is a touching, enjoyable fantasy drama film that is best to watch and enjoy, without over-analyzing.  And for those who are trying to have a child or even planning to adopt, I definitely recommend watching this Blu-ray release as it is a fantasy family film full of heart, as well as full of hope.",1354665600,,4883,4.610208816705336
4797989,4,B005LAIIKS,"The special bond that the young characters Timothy and Joni developed and sustained in the film was endearing. It's refreshing to watch a movie where intimacy is portrayed without relying on sex as the hook to attract viewers. There's really nothing odd about a boy who is comfortable in his own skin who discovers a kindred spirit in a friend who happens to be of the opposite sex. The haven that Timothy and Joni created was both touching and empowering.

They wash him up and call the cops trying to find out who is is, then they notice something even stranger about him. This is a movie that my wife was more interested in seeing then me. We had two different expectations about what this was going to be. To me I was right. This was not really a standard ""chick-flick, on the other hand this isn't a 100% family type movie either. The best way to describe this is a cross between ""A Thousand Words"" and ""Bridge To Terebithia"". I will say that overall this is a good movie but if you have kids that are really sensitive I would screen this first before they watch it.

4797993,4,B005LAIIKS,"What if, after trying desperately to conceive a child, your doctor tells you that it's not possible? How would you get past it? Could you get past it? Maybe, with magic and a little luck, you wouldn't have to.

  Cindy and Jim Green (played by Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton) are a married couple who live in the drought-stricken town of Stanleyville and who struggled to have a child of their own until their doctor told them they were infertile. As a means of moving past this trauma, Jim and Cindy sit down in their living room, write out all the qualities they would want in a child on small slips of paper, puts those slips of a paper in a box, bury the box in their backyard, and go to bed. A thunderstorm begins and ends while they sleep and only affects their home. When Jim and Cindy hear noises in their supposedly empty house, they investigate and find a ten year-old boy sitting on their kitchen counter who tells them his name is Timothy. Timothy (played by CJ Adams) tells the Greens that he is their child and, rather than look a gift horse in the mouth, they take him to the room they prepared for the child they couldn't have, and put him to bed. The next day they introduce Timothy to Cindy's sister, Brenda (played by Rosemarie DeWitt) whose children lived programmed lives and excel in several areas such as music and academics. Additionally, they meet Jim's distant father, with whom Jim has a difficult relationship, also named James (played by David Morse). All while trying to conceal the fact that Timothy has leaves sprouting from his legs that cannot be removed.

  In spite of the science fiction, ABC Family elements, I liked this movie. No, it's not amazing or revolutionary, but the characters are extremely likeable in addition to being entertaining. Rosemarie DeWitt as Garner's sister and arch nemesis is the kind of character you can't help but be annoyed by. Edgerton, determined to be a better father than his own, is very sympathetic. Morse's character is less so, but has some redeeming moments. I won't say I loved it, but it wasn't bad.",1353974400,,2080,4.623306233062331
4797994,5,B005LAIIKS,"The Odd Life of Timothy Green is making its way onto DVD and Blu-ray on December 4th just in time for Christmas. I recall seeing a few advertisements for it when it was released to theaters, but I never got a chance to see it until I watched it on DVD last night. Disney was nice enough to send me an advanced copy in exchange for my honest review.

At first I thought The Odd Life of Timothy Green was based on a book, but I was mistaken as it was based on the concept by Ahmet Zappa. It was written and directed by Peter Hedges (What's Eating Gilbert Grape).

Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Garner star as Jim and Cindy Green, a couple living in the small drought-stricken town of Stanleyville, North Carolina. Jim spends his days working at the town's historic pencil factory while Cindy works at the local museum. The couple desperately wants to have children, but they find out they cannot conceive a child.

Heartbroken, they write down their dream child's characteristics onto pieces of paper, put the pieces into a wooden box and buried it in their garden.

Strangely, a thunderstorm occurs only on their property and they are awaken in the middle of the night by the appearance of a ten-year-old boy named Timothy covered in mud. After cleaning the mud off, Jim and Cindy discover the boy has leaves growing on his legs. Even more odd is that there is a now hole in their garden and the wooden box they buried has been crushed.

The Greens takes the boy in and introduces Timothy to their family and friends as their adopted son. To their surprise, Timothy is not like other boys as he has a special gift that will forever change their lives.

There are not many clean-cut family films anymore, but The Odd Life of Timothy Green is a heartfelt film that the entire family can watch together. By the few advertisements I saw on television, I already had a good idea what the premise was about. Most fantasies focuses on special effects, but The Odd Life of Timothy Green focuses on human emotion brought to life by a well written script and marvelous acting by the entire cast. Overall, I enjoyed watching every bit of the movie as it was a breath of fresh air. I recommend putting the movie on your Christmas wish list.",1353888000,,2224,4.492574257425742
4797995,5,B005LAIIKS,"Disney has gone so downhill in recent decades that I didn't expect much from this movie. But trust me, this is NOT typical Disney filmmaking!

Within the first few minutes, I was glued to the screen. The entire movie has the same atmosphere throughout; slow-paced, gentle, warm, sweet, just enough heart-tugging sadness without making anyone in the audience burst into tears, and the most eye-poppingly beautiful autumn scenery you can imagine. This isn't a cutesy, silly, bathroom-joke-infested Disney/Pixar romp (thank GOD). This is a movie to watch when you just want something gentle and soft and sweet to warm your heart from the inside out. Great acting from the entire cast, Jennifer Garner is as lovable as ever, that woman exudes maternal instinct on the screen. And the little guy who plays Timothy is so cute you'd swear your head's about to explode. But not in a sugary-sappy Haley-Joel-Osment sort of way, where you kind of hope a roving band of fluffy pink monkeys will reclaim him into their tribe and relieve you of his presence. Timothy is just stinkin' cute. Bright and funny when he needs to be, but equally adept at the somber, thoughtful moments.

4797997,4,B005LAIIKS,"Jim and Cindy Green are a couple struggling with infertility. For a long time, they have invested their emotions, their effort, and their dwindling finances into trying to have a child. After their arduous efforts fail, they find themselves sitting across from their infertility doctor, who sheepishly tells them that they have exhausted their options, and that pregnancy will not happen for them. They are devastated, but decide to spend one last evening dreaming about who their child would have been, in an effort to mourn and move on. Disney magic happens, and their dream son, Timothy, grows up overnight from their garden. He has leaves on his shins. He also has a navel, but I'm not sure why.  Jim and Cindy spend the next two hours or so adjusting to having a son, working through their feelings towards other parents they have known, and by their own admission, making mistakes. Timothy disappears, but encourages Jim and Cindy by telling them that they were always ready to be parents. A year passes, and Jim and Cindy decide to pursue parenting through either adoption or foster care.

The movie is good for people considering adoption. The Greens grieve their infertility in what seems to be a healthy manner. They struggle with the desire for Timothy to keep secrets, before finally realizing that it's healthier for him to share his unique story. They defend Timothy from members of their family who criticize him unfairly.

There are some concerning aspects to the movie, and if you're considering adoption, it'd be best to know going in: the Greens have a terrifyingly bad interview with an adoption social worker. The worker is cold, rude, rushed, and uncaring. I've interviewed hundreds of adoptive families and trained several other adoption workers. We're not as mean as the social worker in this movie. Don't let her scare you away.",1351641600,19,1853,4.951768488745981
4797998,5,B005LAIIKS,"This is a great movie! I liked it because the theme was to love yourself no matter what, even if you are different. This movie is about a couple (Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton) that want a child but can't have one. One night they buried a box that had all of the things that they want their child to be like. Later that night a boy named Timothy (C.J. Adams) comes out of the garden and changes the couples life forever.

My favorite part of the movie was at the end when a little girl from the adoption center comes running up to the couple and when walking into their house she is holding there hand and they are so happy to have a real child -forever! I feel like they are meant to have a kid by the way they treat Timothy the minute they see him.

Jennifer Garner, in this film plays Cindy Green. She is a very nice lady and is very loving to Timothy. She is a motherly person and you can tell she is meant to be a mother. Joel Edgerton, plays Jim Green in this movie. He is also very loving and really wants a kid. He would be a person who helps their child go through hard times and shows them how to deal with it.

CJ Adams plays a really important part in this movie as Timothy. Timothy is a great fun loving kid who loves meeting people.  I admire how he is not afraid of anything. I would give The Odd Life of Timothy Green 5 out of 5 stars - it was so good!

The movie will make you laugh, cry and feel all happy inside. I would recommend ages 10 all the way to and adult because this isn't just for kids it is for anyone! You will find adults and kids in the theater, so the ages are all over the place. Even teens will like this movie! Find this movie at a theater near you on august 15, 2012. Julia C, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

The main story of this movie is about love, and I love this movie and can't wait to watch it again. Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Garner play Mr. and Mrs. Green who is trying to have a baby. However, their doctor tells them there is no hope. They are so sad and wanted to move on with their lives. They name their little boy Timothy, then they listed characters that Timothy would have in pieces of paper then put it in a box and bury it so they can go on with their lives. A magical thing happened, Timothy came from the garden where they buried him. Timothy Green play by CJ Adams, is a great actor.  His love for everyone is unconditional. I can see all his emotions through his eyes and his facial expression.

This movie emotion is like riding a roller coaster.  I am laughing and crying on the same scene. The cinematographer and production designer are awesome. The details of the town and the pencil factory are so real. The colors of the fall leaves are so vibrant. They really capture the small town America. Dianne West play a grumpy old woman is so funny with her chin hair. My favorite character is Timothy.  He's always positive and wanted to give all his love to those around him. The only part I did not like is bullying part.  I did not see the bullies being punish for their bad behavior. The messages of this movie are love as much as possible and never give up. I rank this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I give this age ranged 5 and up. Cheyenne N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

4798068,5,B005LAIIKS,"Gonna say it up front: Not a huge Jennifer Garner fan.  She really takes front and center in the film, but that didn't detract from the overall plot and message (for me, anyway).

The boy who places Timothy is just adorable...he is a great, well-timed young actor, and his performance here left me hoping I see more of him in other films.

The plot is heartbreaking at times, as the family struggles through many of today's real-world issues.

The message here is that not everybody fits in, not all the time.  The kids are less than warm with Timothy, which is hard to watch because he's so much more than most of them.

Great film.  Watch it with your kids!",1349740800,,659,4.441666666666666

The Odd Life of Timothy Green was a very well done movie with a very cute and appealing story line. All of the actors played the parts well and the movie was very well done. It tends to be a real tear-jerker at the end, but the story is beautiful and touching. Of course it's fiction, but it is sensitively done in a way that draws you into the story. The outcome of the movie becomes obvious fairly early in the story line, but this really doesn't detract from the movie. you're left feeling like you wish it had ended differently but it does have a sort of happy ending (just like a fairy tale should). If you like ""feel-good"" movies and/or tearjerkers you'll want to put this one on the top of your list. It is certainly a good kids movie (but be aware that it is pretty emotionally moving, so if you have a sensitive child you may want to see it first), but also a good movie for any age.

 I highly recommend it!

4798073,3,B005LAIIKS,"Nobody specializes in magic like Walt Disney does, and so ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is right up their alley. It is the story of Cindy and Jim Green (Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton) who are unable to conceive. They are plagued by this and have reached a breaking point after trying and trying. So when they decide to put everything to rest one night by putting all their wishes and dreams of a child down on paper and burying it in a backyard, they wake up to a magical journey.

""Timothy Green"" is a movie that will tug at your heartstrings as it explores what it takes to be parents with all the failures and successes. Even two parents with the best of intentions aren't perfect and make mistakes. Timothy Green didn't come into the world in the conventional way and CJ Adams does a great job portraying the newborn 10-year old's emotions and naivety.

The early goings of the film are well crafted by the movie creators. They built up the story surrounding Timothy Green and you wonder just as everybody else what is next for the mysterious child. You wonder why there are vines coming from the child's ankles that cannot be removed. You feel the joy that the parents have long since sought and any parent who has had children, lost children, couldn't have children, or have been separated from their children for any length of time will be effected by the emotions.

Yet, as the movie plays out, the storyline begins to feel a little predictable and not as mysterious anymore. Not to mention, some of the crafty storytelling that started off the film seems to fall by the way side as the story comes to a head. The final third of the movie seemed rushed and didn't even come close to capitalizing on the emotions that the audience was ready to feel. They brought us somewhere with really good tact and creativity but when we got there, they hit the gas pedal and rolled the credits. I could elaborate, but that would give away the movie.

""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" is a nice little movie with really great intentions and I won't deny being effected by its message. I just wish it had spent a little more time exploring some of the emotions that they worked so hard throughout the film to develop. I was there, ready to be pushed over the edge, but the seconds and minutes of extra development that should have been done, weren't.",1347321600,2,2348,4.504694835680751

4798075,5,B005LAIIKS,"Once upon a time, Walt Disney Studios made family-oriented movies with a message, wrapped around the small joys and trials of ordinary life.  Turns out they still do.  ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" has an unexpected if charming premise, but the story is mostly about ordinary people working through a variety of family and life issues.  It is a sentimental movie, but the laughs and the heartstring-tugging will work for most viewers.

Once upon a time in a small town, a young couple, Cindy and Jim Green (Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton), frustrated by their inability to conceive, bury their hopes and dreams about a child in a box in their garden.  A strange overnight storm presents them with Timothy, a young boy who is a miracle in more ways than one.  Cindy and Jim will be challenged to provide instant parenting to Timothy, and to explain his sudden appearence in their lives to their respective families and neighbors.

The movie layers multiple sub-plots one on another, including a dying parent and a distant one, sibling rivalries, an uncaring boss, a townwide crisis over a closing factory, a kid's soccer team, and a young girl looking for a kindred soul. Timothy will play a role in each of these sub-plots, which are populated with an exceptionally solid supporting cast.

4798077,4,B005LAIIKS,"""Timothy Green"" offers an enjoyable mix of cheer and fantasy. It hovers on the edge of saccharine, without ever quite going over.

It starts at the other end of the emotional spectrum, though. Jim and Cindy, desperate to be parents, confront the heartbreak of their infertility. They face it stoically enough - but let themselves wallow in their wishes one last time before setting them aside. The magic comes when their wishes come true, in the form of a smiling and mud-smeared boy. From that point on, it's rampant feel-goodism. Jim squares issues with his father, Cindy ends the competition with her sister, and Timothy works wonders for a girl about his own age (played by Odeya Rush, who might resemble Anne Hathaway as an early teen). There's some sadness near the end, but Timothy's Zen-like calm and and quiet joy keep that from being too dark.

As with any fairy tale, this requires suspension of disbelief. Wouldn't anyone ask questions when a small boy appears from nowhere? Or when he  vanishes again? Would the stony-faced bureaucrats at the end actually yield that easily? That level of reality has no place in this charming bit of fluff. Let it be what it wants to, and you might find a lot to enjoy.
