7914254,5,B00000K3TH,"Whether you are a GBV, Pavement, or Yo La Tengo fan or the many excellent bands on this label, you cannot go wrong with this set of video compilations. I highly recommend this. I wish more 90's labels would get this stuff out there for new generations looking for the roots of underground music. Teenbeat, Elephant 6, Darla, Kranky, Up c'mon let's get some DVD out there.",1366416000,,371,4.552238805970149
7914255,5,B00000K3TH,"Between Homestead Records and Matador Records, Gerard Cosloy has managed to put together some of the leading ""stars"" of independent rock.  This DVD has some of the best from Matador US - Pavement, Yo La Tengo, Jon  Spencer Blues Explosion, Pizzacato 5,  and many more.  I especially loved  the videos for Yo La Tengo's ""Sugarcube"" and Jon Spencer Blues  Explosion's ""Talkin' 'Bout the Blues"" (guest appearance by Winona  Ryder!).
If you're a fan of just a few of the bands on this DVD, it's a  great chance to see their videos. The menu is split between the two  original VHS tapes.  However, you can also browse by artist or just play  all the videos.",950832000,4,652,4.631578947368421
7914256,5,B00000K3TH,"This DVD contains both the What's Up Matador and Everything is Nice video comps (note that the video version of Everything is Nice does not contain the What's Up Matador show, which makes the DVD quite worthwhile).  Everything is Nice contains many classic videos from Yo La Tengo (their  Sugarcube video is priceless), Chavez, Helium, Cornelius, Pizzicato 5,  Pavement, and more. What's Up Matador, which came out a couple of years  ago, is a very funny program that is set up like a kid's show and features  ""interviews"" with various Matador records stars, along with even  more classic videos from the artists mentioned above, and some others also.  There are 25 videos here in all, and they cover the lifespan of Matador  records. Matador is the best record label around, and there is ample proof  on this DVD of that.",948240000,10,822,4.814285714285714
