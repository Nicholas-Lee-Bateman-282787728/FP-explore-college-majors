8173177,5,B000MWC9ZK,"This is a wonderful collection of video of Elis not available elsewhere. If you are a fan, here is what you need. The most important videos are the 1973 black and white video followed by the video of her concert in Montreux. Both are breathtaking and show Elis at the top of her game. This collection follows together with the color version of one of her latest concerts. If you are familiar with Ellis, there is nothing more to say. This has her singing casually with Tom Jobim, a wonderful rendition of Travessia, and songs you will not see elsewhere. A very sad surprise which will bring you to tears is the final scene that gives you a brief glimpse of her face in her casket. She would have only been 62 had she not died from overmedication. It is unimaginable that one so alive could be so dead. There you have it - get the 1973 video, the Montreux concert (available on E-Bay as a bootleg) and then this one.",1172707200,7,915,4.356725146198831

Director Roberto de Oliveira is one of the most famous TV directors and producers in Brazil, particularly known for his TV Specials on music stars. He produced a 4-program  series of TV specials on singer Elis Regina during the seventies, all for local TV Bandeirantes. Of these programs, only her special with Antonio Carlos Jobim is not included in this package as long as it was reserved to be issued separately.

This video package is then composed by three DVDs, most of all containing material from 3 out of the 4 programs before mentioned, all sequenced in a random order what imparted a certain confusion of images which were mixed without a criterious selection. In other words, you will not watch each TV Special in its original image sequence. This is quite identifiable by the dresses Ms. Regina wears which appear randomly in each part of the tree videos. I'd rather have the original sequence of all programs but this is not a complete sin just because Elis Regina's artistry makes it all above this kind of misleading.

To what it may concern to music, it is plain to say that you'll find here a wide panorama of Ms. Regina music from the seventies until her death in 1982, including some exclusive and rare images and random takes from miscellaneous TV appearances. You'll watch her sing some songs she has never recorded in an album. Great!

You'll also watch her in action with her best team of musicians along her career. Her combo throughout nearly all the programs was leaded by her husband Mr. Csar Camargo Mariano (piano and arrangements) with Hlio Delmiro on guitar, Paulinho Braga on drums, and Luizo Maia on bass. This is what one should call the standard for a Brazilian singer at the time. Eventually some other musicians would replace members in this basic and historic combo, notably Nathan Marques on guitar. Also at the end of her career (her last video appearances in the third video), Mr. Camargo Mariano was not her official pianist anymore, being replaced by other lesser known though competent musicians. Also their marriage had come to an end. This happened less than a year before her death in 1982.

At last, there is another remarkable quality about those DVDs: you'll listen to (and eventually watch them in action with Ms. Regina) some of the `crme de la crme' among the greatest composers from the post-Bossa Nova era in Brazilian modern music. Composers like Milton Nascimento, Joo Bosco,  and Gilberto Gil along with composers who came from Bossa Nova but kept their pace in the post-Bossa Nova scene like Baden Powell, Johnny Alf and, of course, Antonio Carlos Jobim.

The first DVD is titled `Na Batucada da Vida'. It intends to show her story from the very beginning as a child. A photograph session is shown in the video while you'll listen to Ms. Regina's voice singing Paul Anka's `Puppy Love' in a  Portuguese version (`Garoto ltimo Tipo') taken from her very first album from her early times before she began her stardom in the Brazilian music scene.

The sequence is a block made up by Black & White scenes from her famous interview, the TV special `Ensaio Geral' which is also documented in its completeness in another DVD which you can find here @Amazon (Elis Regina `Ensaio Geral'). This block offers some of her smash hits like `Vida de Bailarina', and `O Trem Azul'. Following is a great swinger session with Ms. Regina singing a traditional samba ` Com Esse Que Eu Vou' and Gilberto Gil's `Ladeira da Preguia' both from her 1973 album `Elis' as is the next song `Folhas Secas', also a traditional samba by famous composer Nelson Cavaquinho. Next you'll watch her sing Tom Jobim's `Triste' (`Soltiude'), the same arrangement from her album with the late composer.

Follows a block made up by Joo Bosco's compositions. Joo Bosco is one of those greatest Brazilian composers (he also sings and plays his acoustic guitar quite well) who deserves more international recognition. Refer to some Dave Grusin and Lee Ritenour videos and CDs and you'll know Bosco singing and playing along with those Jazz greats. His career was fully launched in Brazil by Ms. Regina and you'll watch her sing along with him her smash hits `O Mestre-Sala dos Mares', `Bodas de Prata', `Cabar', and `Dois pra L, Dois pra C' among others, all composed by Bosco. There is also a song by Bosco she has never recorded in an album `Gol Anulado'.

Following is a medley of Baden Powell's compositions, all Ms. Regina smash hits from the late 60s and early 70s like `Canto de Ossanha' (`Let Go'), `Deixa', `Lapinha', the sensational `Quaquar-Quaqu' and `Aviso aos Navigantes'.

Following is another sequence of her big hits what includes her sensitive renditions to Jobim's `O Que Tinha de Ser', Chico Buarque's `Tatuagem', Francis Hime and Chico Buarque's `Atrs da Porta', and Jobim's `guas de Maro' (`Waters of March').

There is also a rare take from one of her music meetings with Antonio Carlos Jobim when he makes Ms. Regina get to know the song `Na Batucada da Vida', an old hit of traditional samba by composer Ary Barroso (the same composer of `Brazil'), all sung by Jobim. Ms. Regina would record it in her 1974 album `Elis', also available here @Amazon.

The first DVD closes flashing back her `Puppy Love' rendition, which you'll listen during the final credits.

The second DVD is titled `Doce de Pimenta'. It opens with a sequence of her 1974 recordings - her yearly current album and her album with Jobim. More songs by Milton Nascimento and Joo Bosco.

It also offers an interesting block with an old man called Adoniran Barbosa, a great composer of traditional samba deserving more recognition. In another block Ms. Regina sings with pop rock singer Ms. Rita Lee, a set of two neglectable songs but with the magic touch of Elis Regina.

The third DVD is titled `Falso Brilhante'. It opens with its title show `Falso Brilhante', a smash hit in the theater during 1975 and 1976. Also one of her great albums `Falso Brilhante', currently available in DVD-Audio here @Amazon.

It also offers a video block on compositions by Johnny Alf, the great composer from the early times of Bossa Nova. Ms. Regina and Tom Jobim sing together `Cu e Mar' along with Cesar Camargo Marino at the piano. Following is a clip of her beautiful rendition of `Iluso a Toa', also arranged by Csar Camargo Mariano. Both are big smash hits by Mr. Alf in Brazil.

An extraordinary and strong moment in the DVD is Ms. Regina and Milton Nascimento meeting. His composition `Caxang' is beautifully performed by Elis Regina, singing along with beautiful vocals by Nascimento himself (also on acoustic guitar) and by Nathan Marques (also on electric guitar).

Also features her presentation of a new extraordinary composer, Ms. Ftima Guedes, one more great composer to have her career launched by Elis Regina. Regina and Guedes sing together Guedes' composition `Meninas da Cidade' beautifully.

When singer Elis Regina died in 1982, she was in her doings of a new album which would include her last single smash hit `Me Deixas Louca"", translated into Portuguese from the original bolero by the great Armando Manzanero `Me Vuelves Loco'. Her TV appearance singing this song is one of her last ones.
