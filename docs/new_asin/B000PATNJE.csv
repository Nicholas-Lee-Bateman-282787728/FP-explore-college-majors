2814856,5,B000PATNJE,My kids enjoyed the DVD so much they watched it three or four times. The DVD entertained them while it really got them thinking about having good manners in many different situations.,1208649600,8,183,4.75
2814857,5,B000PATNJE,"Finally a DVD that teaches manners in a fun and creative way.  The whole point of an educational DVD is to learn something.  The Kids Good Manners DVD does just that.  My child watched it several months ago and to this day she still remembers and more important, displays the CORRECT manners.  The best thing I like about this DVD is you play a game while learning.",1208131200,13,365,4.402985074626866
2814881,3,B000PATNJE,"It's hard to guess what age level they're aiming at here.  They try to make it fun, but some of the situations are way too confusing or complex for a 4 or 5 yr old, yet other situations in this DVD are just way too easy for older children.

It might work well if you had a group of kids of different ages, or maybe if you had to assume little to no knowledge of manners and etiquette in older kids (e.g. a remedial or therapeutic class, or kids who just have never been taught basic manners).  In that situation I can see the DVD working incredibly well by being interesting, not patronizing or judgmental, and explaining in a straightforward manner what to do manners-wise.

However if you're a parent trying to teach your kid manners, I think the DVD is OK but not great - it's just that a portion of the DVD is not useful for younger kids and another portion is not useful for older kids.",1371859200,3,891,4.254437869822485
2814882,3,B000PATNJE,"My kids did not like the format of a quiz show. It does cover topics, but could not hold my kids attention. 4 boys (12, 10, 6, 4)",1359504000,2,129,3.642857142857143
2814883,3,B000PATNJE,Maybe because my daughter is a little young for this product (she's 3) but I thought it was very cheaply made (home video-esque) and it didn't hold her attention for long at all and she loves TV.  It seems better suited to showing kids in school not at home where they are more used to TV entertaining them.,1338508800,,307,4.293103448275862
2814884,1,B000PATNJE,"This product actually deserves a zero for quality. The DVD that I received wasn't playing very well, was skipping all the time. The replacement I got wasn't playing at all. Total waste of my time. I was totally looking forward to my child enjoying this DVD but no luck with this one. Absolutely no quality to this product.",1315872000,2,322,4.568965517241379
2814885,3,B000PATNJE,"This DVD gives good information but is rather dull in comparison to the Look Mom, I Have Good Manners DVD which is also a game format, covers all the material in The Kids Good Manners DVD but does it with an exagerated game show format that is fun both to kids and parents.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Look-Mom-I-Have-Good-Manners/dp/B00012FXJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Look Mom - I Have Good Manners</a>",1297296000,,453,6.32258064516129
2814886,5,B000PATNJE,My kids Barbara and Bradley really liked this manners DVD. They thought it was fun and helpful.,1255996800,,95,4.647058823529412
2814887,3,B000PATNJE,"Got this hoping it was more detailed than a video I bought previously (""Look Mom, I Have Good Manners""--which I liked overall better than this item) and discovered it covered pretty much the same topics. I was looking for something more sophisticated, I suppose. My eight year old watched politely and we agreed that it seemed pretty flat and unimaginative.  It addresses topics such as basic table manners, good sportsmanship, and how to answer the phone politely, but honestly, it was pretty lame (what's with the crudely animated dog parroting the answers to the quiz?) despite the game-show format, which could have enlivened it considerably.  I won't be going to the trouble and expense of returning it (I used my Amazon Rewards bucks to purchase it, so it was essentially free), but maybe I can pass it along to a family with younger kids.",1255737600,8,845,4.861111111111111
2814888,5,B000PATNJE,"The DVD was fun for my children to watch and learn manners. They liked the game show format. The unique format kept them interested  and as a result they now have a concept of good behavior.

They actually select this DVD on their own to watch over and over. I give the producers extremely high marks for ingenuity and content.",1223251200,9,327,4.433333333333334
2814889,2,B000PATNJE,"I bought with a view to get overall grasp of the manners. BUT it covers mostly table manners. The other ones are cheap shots. My 4 year old could able to answer 99% questions. Unless your child do know basics of social manners, I don't think it is worth buying it.",1221436800,8,264,4.196078431372549
2814890,5,B000PATNJE,"This DVD helps kids learn in a fun, entertaining way. It sets up specific situations that children deal with daily and teaches manners in a game format. Kids will enjoy the game, and learn some good manners at the same time. I'd recommend it.",1215302400,3,242,4.5227272727272725

8190113,1,B000PATNJE,Not worth at all. Total rip off. Came with a price sticker of 9.99 and charged us 12.99,1434585600,2,87,3.888888888888889

8190116,2,B000PATNJE,"Thanks to Amazon Prime, I was able to watch this DVD before purchasing it. I was looking for a DVD that teaches good manners for a five year old. This is definitely targeted for 8 years and above. It designed around multiple choice questions and your child earns points for the correct answer. Not what I was looking for at all.  That said, it may be used to reinforce good manners to older kids.",1409616000,6,396,4.351351351351352

8190118,4,B000PATNJE,My kids needed some manners so i got this dvd. It is helpful. They learned some manners and now they are more focused on behaving at the dinner table. We will see if it lasts,1392076800,,174,4.0
8190119,3,B000PATNJE,This video was purchased for etiquette class that was teaching for grades K - 5.  I have not used it but I believe it will help reinforce what i am teaching by putting practical application to the lesson.,1390348800,,204,4.368421052631579
