8692283,5,B00QQPE2T8,"Archer is an awesome series about a smart-in-all-the-wrong-ways Secret Agent Sterling Archer who works for the Isis Agency. This series is hilarious, it's definitely crude and ridiculous but it's made for adults so expect adult issues and conversations. The box set seems a bit overpriced but the series itself is wonderful and worth having permanently in your collection.",1434067200,,372,5.431034482758621
