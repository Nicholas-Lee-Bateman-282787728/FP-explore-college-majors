1689877,5,B0000639HK,"wow, i really loved this DVD. i cant wait for the second one to come out! ryoko is a great fighter and i cant wait to see what happens to her. i definetly recommend it",1025308800,,167,3.8
1689878,4,B0000639HK,"I came into this with pretty low expectations, and left suitabily surprised. While the basic plot is rather hackneyed (super-skilled kendo girl fits in the school league, but also finds a pendant that makes her punk demons in another world from time to time), the characters are actually pretty likeable, even if they are common anime archtypes. The show does a good job of keeping the mood light without becoming completely flippant, and the episodes really fly by. The fight scenes are the definite standouts, with great choreography and pacing, but the other scenes of character and plot building are also done well enough to hold your interest.
The dialogue is actually pretty fast and witty, and the translation is pretty good, which certainly helps matters. Visually, the show has nice production values, with well-articulated motion and vibrant, clean colors. Character designs are also very well done. The fight scenes in particular are very well done, and the motion in these scenes is easy to follow. If you're looking for a lighthearted and fun anime with some really well done fighting sequences, you really should check this out. It's certainly worth a look.",1022371200,9,1171,5.072538860103627
1689879,4,B0000639HK,"When I heard about the arrival of Real Bout High School, I was skeptical at first, because of the fact that it was centered around fighting. While I am a huge fan of Street Fighter, most fighting animes don't have any plot, and don't do well at all. I had heard good things about the series, and I had happened to go shopping a day or two after it came out, saw that there was only one copy left, and decided to give it a go.
""Samurai Girl: Real Bout High School"" is about a girl named Ryoko Mitsurugi who is titled as the best fighter at the school, and Is always being challenged by different teams or people -- and these fights are actually encouraged by the school board. In the first episode, Ryoko finds a necklace that transports her into an alternate realm to defeat monstors. She later returns and tries to figure out what she had just experienced. Ryoko's rival is Azumi Mitsurugi, and they're always arguing over a guy named .  Although they are rivals, Azumi tells Ryoko that she can learn to advance her skills by becoming the apprientance of a mysterious man named Tessai Onizuka, who teaches her to use her weapon as a sword, and as a stick.
The animation is extremely good for a television series, and there weren't any noticable jumps or rainbows around charectors.  Shading is done wonderfully, and colors are bright and brilliant.
The sound is just your classic TV stereo sound.
The menus were done very well and creatively.  The menu looks like an actuall fighting video game match going on between Ryoko and Azumi.  The sub-menus look like options menus and select-a-charector type menus.
There are four episodes on the disc.  ""Enter the Samauri Girl"", ""The Strongest Man Joins the Fight"", ""Enter the Way of the Swordsman"", and ""The Girl with the Deep Black Eyes"".
Some of the english voice actors on Real Bout High School have worked on previous shows like Cowboy Bebop and Rayman Earth, so they should be recignizeable.
Some extras include four ""Special End Corners"", which are little extras hosted by the two main Japanese voice actresses.
The first four episodes are very good, and the show is promising. We just have to see where the series takes itself.",1021766400,13,2180,4.637305699481865
1689910,3,B0000639HK,"This was a waste of money for me. I read and loved the graphic novels, so I figured that I would like this just as much. NOT! This was a major disappointment.
The storyline of the manga was fast-paced, humorous, and very entertaining. Although it occasionally became difficult to distinguish what was going on, on the whole it was a lot of fun to read.
Unfortunately, that same fun storyline was mangled and then dropped by the anime writers. Now, instead of centering on the K-Fights and high school life, it focuses on an interdimensional adventure that doesn't play out. Ryoko is perfect as a fighter, but it is difficult to see the slightly conceited, sword-wielding samurai beauty as fighting dragons and talking to princesses. And there is not even any background given on why this dimension and its ruler need her help.
Then another new character comes in, and OF COURSE he knows all about this other dimension, the fight with the dragon, and the talk with the princess. I have one question--who is he, and how does he know all that? The fight with the dragon was a private affair with Ryoko, the dragon, and the princess. So where was he? *sighs* This is yet another thing in this new storyline that doesn't mesh.
On the other hand, the characters are wonderful. Ryoko is my favorite, with her rival Azumi following in an extremely close second. Both girls are awesome fighters, and really fun characters. Shizuma didn't get much of a chance to shine here, but from what I can tell he is exactly the same as he was in the manga. The reporter is still a creepy little stalker with a thing for Ryoko, although his English voice actor is the person who played Tai from Digimon (its impossible for me to watch RBHS without thinking--""Hey, that's Tai!"") And just like in the manga, Ryoko's best friend is kicked out of the picture by the arrival of Shizuma.
The art is beautiful. Colors are bright and easy to look at, and the movement could not be smoother. The fight scenes are the only reason I watch this dvd anymore--those scenes are wicked cool! So there is one redeeming factor.
The voice acting is great in both versions. I think the English is better. The girls are not high and squeaky, and there is a wider range of emotions. In fact, I find their voices rather soothing.
I feel I should mention that my computer's dvd player has a problem with this dvd, making the soundtrack skip and jump. This is very disconcerting for a dvd.
Although I like the voices, the art, and the characters, I still don't like this anime, mainly because of the warped storyline. It has been more than a year since I have watched this, and I don't think I'll be watching it again anytime soon.",1080259200,3,2685,4.561076604554866
1689911,1,B0000639HK,"I think my problem with the series is that I read the Graphic Novels first. The graphic novels are top notch with great art and a great story that has a lot of action and flows really well. The G.N.'s also manage a wide emotional range that is not diminished by the humor.
The animation seems childish by comparison. It starts I guess in the middle of the graphic novels and doesn't even bother to follow the story line. It goes its own way with people from other dimensions and battle with dragons and such. The characters are 2 dimensional (pardon the pun) with no real emotional depth being created. Most of the events seem to be directed at a younger crowd (like kids).
The artwork fails to live up to expectations. The story line falls apart. Character development is nill.
The Manga is your best bet. These DVD's are not.
The music wasn't bad. In fact I would recommend the soundtrack. It has about 40 songs so the average length is pretty short per song (one track being a 10 second sound bite).",1069718400,3,1002,4.451086956521739
1689912,5,B0000639HK,"Real Bout High school is a delightful comedy with all the fight to back it up.
The story follows a young girl named Ryoko Mitsurugi who is destined in her heart to be a samurai. One day she finds an amulet in her locker that changes her life forever. Being transported to another relm called Solvania to battle demons Ryoko relaizes her destiny to save the world from Gates a ruthful god of destuction, and to make sure she still reighns as the champ. The story however in itself is not all macbre. With delightful charcters such as the tenacious but stupid Shizumaa Kusanagi who is always out for a good fight(mainly with our little samurai girl Ryoko) and beautiful but deadly Azumi Kiribiyashi Real Bout High is in for hours of pantyshots,killer fights,screams, and laughs.",1065657600,,776,4.713235294117647

1689914,3,B0000639HK,"I borrowed this DVD from my friend, and I thought it seemed cute and a little bit gratuitous.
  I expected large breasts, needless panty shots, the high-pitched squeals of girls screaming, and plenty of cool sword fights, and Real Bout High School delivers in each of those categories. The DVD menus are laid out in an amusing way, like a fighting game, and the extras are also quite charming. The animation is fluid for the most part and the cels are extremely clean and clear.
  The plot seems to revolve around two girls, a ""Samurai Drama Otaku"" named Mitsurugi Ryoko and Onizuka Miyuki, a rudely mute shrine priestess who ignores everybody. Her rude personality is apparently supposed to show that she is in inner-turmoil, but it just makes me want to slap her.
  Anyway, Ryoko is very charming as the ""Samurai Drama Otaku,"" who, despite being a total dork, is immensely popular at her school, which places tons of focus on physical education and almost none on academia. Her rival, Kusanagi, is a very funny character, because he seems to be a parody of Kusanagi Kyo of the King of Fighters series, as he has an insatiable appetite for street fights and even uses flames in his fighting (honoo no tora - the flaming tiger) (and he has shares the name, Kusanagi).
  Unfortunately, there are a few problems as well. The voice-acting is a little stereotypical and inappropriate for some situations, and most of the characters speak ridiculously fast or over-act (or both), most likely as an attempt to be endearing or ""cutesy,"" like so many of those for-boys shows out there (By the way, this is with regards to the original Japanese dialogue; the dub is not even worth considering).
  Also of dissapointing noteworthiness is the translation. Oftentimes, I found that the translation was off or even wrong, and the translators seemed confused as to who was talking to whom. Multiple colors used to seperate things being said simultaneously would help tremendously. Also, I noticed many spelling and grammatical errors in both the english translation and the japanese song lyrics that are unacceptable in a professional-quality release such as this.
  Despite the problems I had, Real Bout High School is nevertheless a charming and fun, albeit immature and poorly-localized, anime. Fans of girl-get anime such as Tenchi Muyo!, Love Hina and Chobits and fans of good action-oriented anime (as well as sailor-uniformed school girl fetishists) will probably enjoy this very much. But remember, you could be buying something a lot better.",1051315200,4,2536,4.983412322274882
1689915,2,B0000639HK,"Up until this final volume, I really like Real Bout High School--the characters were silly but engaging, the story line much the same.  Unfortunately, the show couldn't finish the race.  This volume is an utterly unsatisfactory way to end the show.
First, out of the three episodes on this disc, there's probably a full episode's worth of flashback.  That is inexcusable on a 13 episode series like this, and even more that it is all on one volume--a third of this disc is flashbacks.  Bleh.
Second, the storyline falls completely apart.  The battle promised in Episode 12's title never occurs, and the real climax of the series is all but off-screen.  There is also no resolution to the (admittedly silly) romantic subplot.
Finally, nothing which does happen on-screen makes much sense.  We never see the connection between Miyuki's mystical powers and the events around her; we never see what Gates really is (mafia boss or demon or both); we never learn why Ryoko suddenly gets some magical powers of her own.  The explanations, such as they come, are in almost nonsensical one-liners--you just can't put them together to assemble anything.
Ryoko's adventures thus come to a disappointing ending.  The standard anime excuse for a failed ending--you can go read the manga (comic)--doesn't even help here: the comic tells an entirely different story, which has none of the supernatural elements of the anime.
I guess if you like the show up until now, you probably want to see the end, but beware: you'll be disappointed.  If you haven't seen it, perhaps you'll want to pass it by--up until volume 3, I would have recommended this series, but not now.",1037923200,19,1652,4.910071942446043
1689916,5,B0000639HK,"---------------------------------------------------------
If you like anime with lots of fighting in it--this is it.  This anime is a fighting based cartoon animation that uses incredible computer animated fighting effects in some also very incredibles battles for some extreme eye popping visuals.
  The main character is Ryoko, a student at a private school that has traditional k-fights with wooden weapons used as substitutes for real weapons.  They are tournament like, and the fighting is what this DVD is all about.  Fights are remarkably well done.
  OF course, the plot involves more than that.  The main character is drawn into another dimension, where she has to hone her fighting skills even more and face even tougher opponents while she also tries to live life in the real world.
  This DVD starts you off in her adventure that is just beginning.",1036281600,6,860,5.211678832116788
1689917,4,B0000639HK,"This first volume of Real Bout High School proves to be engaging. The story leaves you wanting more and the battles are fun to watch. Neither of these are what make Real Bout an excellant show however, Real Bout's real strength is its characters. These are the kind of characters that are just fun to watch and have the chemistry to make a great show. I hope further volumes prove to be as entertaining as this first one.",1029110400,2,421,4.410256410256411
1689918,4,B0000639HK,"As I was halfway through this disc, I was thinking to myself ""What happened?!"".  The first disc of RBHS got me seriously hooked on this series.  The colors were solid and vibrant, the art was clear and detailed, the music was catchy and appropriate, and the characters were cool and likeable.  The most important thing about the first disc was that the episodes had an enjoyable plot.  On this disc you find only three episodes (four on the first) and I must say I thought the quality of not only the story, but the artwork has decreased since the first disc.  The video quality is still great with vibrant clear colors, but the first two episodes artwork looks like a rush job.  The third episode makes up for them, and I recognized the great looking anime style that I loved so much in the first disc.  Everything just seems a little bit more detailed.  I'd recommend this only if you really liked the first disc, and want to stay loyal to this series.  Everything else about this DVD is fantastic.  The keepcase I got was clear but I heard they released a limited edition colored case.  Inside are some translators notes, and the disc itself is coated with a really nice glossy material, and features some sharp line art of Ryoko.  The menus are simply the best I've seen on an anime DVD, with the idea of two characters fighting it out like a video game whil you select your choices.  When you buy this DVD you're getting a real beautiful piece of work, but be warned you may find the overall content to be less than satisfying.",1028419200,4,1532,4.467625899280575
7959135,2,B0000639HK,"Fans of the manga will be let down and confused. Compared to the manga, this is a painful adaptation. The art is pretty, but instead of being an awesome and mostly serious battle anime, some reason the magical girl genre was thrown in. Many of the dubbed voices are bad.",1514678400,,270,4.42

7959137,4,B0000639HK,"This series has a wonderful first episode, with some cool characters (and a couple of creepy ones).

Ryoko is tall, and has a bit of a complex about it. She is a master of the bokken (wooden sword), and current champion of her school at ""street fighting"" using it. Her fiercest rival is the president of the flower arranging club, with whom she competes for the affections of the captain of the kendo team.

You might think that her fighting at school would get her into trouble, but this is Daimon Academy, the ""real bout high school"" of the title, where fighting is encouraged, with cheerleaders, an announcer full of energy and bounce, and the school principal giving play-by-play commentary.

Sadly, it goes a bit downhill after that. Rather than continuing to explore the dynamics at the school, they seemed to feel it was necessary to introduce an almost unrelated plot. Pity. Still, it provides plenty of entertainment value, providing you can see past the vast number of panty flashes.",1403913600,,993,4.829411764705882
7959138,3,B0000639HK,"Ryoko is one of the best fighters in school.  But that's OK because this is a school in which martial arts are standard curriculum and problems are solved with the fist and the sword.  But when you add a alien landscape just beyond the veils of reality, special powers and demon creatures even Ryoko starts to freak out.  Four episodes, tons of extras, great voice work, but a feeling that I have seen all this before.
Promising but so was steam powered cars in the early 20th Century.  Does that mean I should continue to buy up the anime and watch?  Not sure, can't tell you.  I may watch the next DVD but I'm just not hooked.",1246838400,,628,4.3247863247863245

7959140,5,B0000639HK,"It's a really good yet short anime series. It kept me entertained with the humor Daisaku provided. Joshua Seth was good as Daisaku's part and David Lucas kept Shizuma's character, like in the japanese version. It may be 13 episodes long but I still like it.",1138406400,,257,4.608695652173913
7959141,4,B0000639HK,"Visually, the series is beautiful; furthermore, the show features excellent vocal performances (The ever-versatile Satsuki Yukino reinvents herself again to play the main character's romantic rival, Azumi...Sempai)and is strong in the department of character development. I was already a fan of the manga (And I feel the manga features stronger storytelling than the anime.), but I feel I learned additional information about the characters by watching the program. The series is also entertaining on a more subtle level, as it relentlessly mocks (Or homages) conventions such as the ""Magical Girl"" genre of anime and manga, fighting games, samurai cinema, and other fighting series; Nagumo and Gates, the two rival characters new to the series, are extremely reminiscent of characters from such series as ""Fist of the North Star""; the trio of villains our heroes encounter in the midpoint of the series, alternately, remind me of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" characters. There's even a girl dressed like certain characters from Tenchi Muyo, as well as villains at the end which seem somewhere between Raxzehphon and Evangelion entities. These references are pretty entertaining, since the show isn't built around them, but rather character development and striking visuals.

At first, I didn't ""get"" the fact many of the character designs created for the anime were supposed to resemble designs from other anime series, and wrote them off as unoriginal. But my attributions of unoriginality nagged at me, because the rest of the visuals in the series were so well-crafted. So the ""uninspired"" designs are really very funny once one realizes they're *supposed* to be that way. ^_^

The slight redesigns of the manga characers appeal to me, though I will warn they've been slightly cutified. The Demon Beasts Ryoko has to fight unfortunately lack interesting designs, one of the series' visual shortfallings; Studio Gonzo does remarkable work in many departments, but I sometimes find that, as a trend, their creature designs are a bit run-of-the-mill.

Furthermore, although developing the characters well, in terms of plot development, however, the series inadequately explains background on the conflict between the characters Nagumo and Gates, as well as the connections amongst Nagumo, Hitomi and Reiha which would help viewers enjoy the program better.

However, I felt Nagumo's ""true conflict"" which is revealed in the final episode, while somewhat anticlimatic (In not involving a slugfest) was very interesting because it added a philosophical bent to the series; it reminds me of the (Oft-maligned) resolution of another show from the fighting girl genre, Ikki Tousen, in that it centers on defeating fate.

In terms of DVD content, the extras are neat. There are the art galleries almost standard to anime DVDs, but in addition, a number of segments which introduce you to the Japanese voice actresses who portray Ryoko and Miyuki. I enjoyed these segments because they added a human touch to my viewing of the series.

All-in-all, I'd recommend reading the manga first, not because it's necessary to understand the series, but because it's a better story. But if you read and enjoyed the manga, the series is well-worth watching, given you can get a good deal on it.",1137369600,,3264,5.267307692307693
7959142,3,B0000639HK,"Ok, so I bought the box set because I loved the manga, and I guess because of how great the original manga was, I set my expectations too high. The series really started with a bang, and the animation for the fight scenes were way too cool; however, as the series continued some of the episodes had really slack animation. I mean it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the greatest. Naturally I watched the whole thing and the animation almost returned to its previous glory toward the end. I tried to keep in mind how old the series was, and maybe I watch too much Anime.

There is however another interesting point I must bring up, and that's the time setting that the show takes. It seems to be after, and yet at the same time, that the manga took place, which may be kind of confusing for anyone who read the manga. I really can't give any examples without spoiling either the manga or the anime so I won't. Just take my word for it. And then there's the awkward and abrupt ending. I was kind of disappointed.

Finally I'll say this; all in all, the show is good enough not to be bad, but not great enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Three stars are what I'll give it. I've seen much worse shows, and at the same time I've seen much better. If you ask me you should spent your forty dollars on the first four issues of the manga being published by TokyoPop.
