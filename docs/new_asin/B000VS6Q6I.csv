2946433,5,B000VS6Q6I,"This dvd captures Boston metal at its finest. Both shows on the disc are sick. I put this up there with Killswitch's ""Set This World Ablaze"", and can't wait for the live Unearth dvd early next year.",1199059200,,198,4.378378378378378
2946434,5,B000VS6Q6I,"ATR is by far one of the top bands in the metal scene today, with some of the most brutal, awe-inspiring live sets I've ever seen.  I'm not sure why this guy is complaining about a lack of 5.1, the sound quality is some of the best I've heard on a live metal DVD.  Despite the extremely similar set lists of the two shows... your in for a unique experience with each.  All the music videos are top notch, and the band/fan interviews make for good fun as well.  If your a fan of live metal... or metal in general, everything in the ATR catalog is worth picking up, you won't be disappointed!",1198713600,2,590,4.1946902654867255
2946435,5,B000VS6Q6I,I have been a huge ATR fan for years. This movie is the best live DVD from a band that I have ever seen. It is like you are at the concert in Philly or at the concert in Baltimore. If you have ever seen ATR live then you know this is a must buy. Especially for viewing in between concerts.,1197417600,,289,3.7540983606557377
2946436,5,B000VS6Q6I,"Just to let you all know, while it might be only a 2.0 soundtrack, its encoded in LPCM (says so on my reciver.) Also, yes, you can hear Oli's guitar in the right speaker (and yes, that includes the solos).  the one that said he couldn't hear them, better get his speakers fixed.  speaking of the sound, yeah its not 5.1, but I'm even amazed that it sounds this clear, since the recher theater is known for not having the best sound system, i don't think they did any over dubbing.

And i make a couple of appierences in the dvd.  First shot after the ""directed by"" credit, i am the one in the white with glasses and a buried your dead t shirt.  Also thats my buddy in the cannibal corpse t.  You can also see me crowd surf at the end of ""this calling"".

Great show overall, def. worth picking up as a fan (also, to hear Phil pull off some impressive range, going from a scream/growl to a clean sing, to straight up full on hardcore death vocals in ""the weak willed"". You can really tell how small the recher theatre stage is whenever you see a wide shot.  One thing, Phil its pronounced Towson as in town, not with the little ou accent.",1195084800,2,1136,4.202764976958525
2946437,3,B000VS6Q6I,"This is one of the live best bands out now. I've seen them twice and have yet to be disappointed. Having said that,I was very excited when I heard about this.
  Production picture wise is pretty good,but I think the sound engineer dropped the ball. Oli Herbert's leads are conspicuously absent. You can see he's playing,but can't hear him at all. I like this band enough to buy this but just wished they would've taken more time and made it perfect for their loyal fans.",1194307200,,470,4.517647058823529
2946438,1,B000VS6Q6I,"This video had all the makings too be 5 stars, but unfortunatelty it was not remastered in Dolby 5.1 surround, which in this day in age is unexcusable. In fact this video was not even in Dolby 2.0 which was not playable on my surround sound system. I was able too play it on my good old TV speakers though. Yay!!! Don't get me wrong I'm a huge ATR fan but this video was a joke.",1193961600,3,378,3.986842105263158

8219641,5,B000VS6Q6I,"I LOVE ALL THAT REMAINS. THIS DVD HAS 2 GREAT PERFORMANCES ON IT. REALLY ENJOY THE TWIN I FOUND THIS BAND RIGHT AFTER THEY STARTED AND RELEASED ""THIS DARKENED HEART"". TO ME THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW BANDS THAT REALLY BROUGHT METAL BACK TO THE MASSES IN EARLY 2000'S. ALONG WITH KILLSWITCH ENGAGE, SHADOWS FALL, GOD FORBID, SLIPKNOT, LAMB OF GOD AND CHIMAIRA BROUGHT BACK METAL TO WHERE IT BELONGS IN MAINSTREAM ROCK COMMUNITY",1404864000,,422,4.64
8219642,5,B000VS6Q6I,"I received this a day ago, and just wow! It is a must have for any All That Remains have, I loved all the extras, i found out so much about the band i didn't know. I would recommend this to all All That Remains fans!",1325203200,,216,3.717391304347826
8219643,5,B000VS6Q6I,This is an awesome dvd for every metal fan. Good production value too. The chorus melodic parts are a little different and sometimes they let the crowd sing instead but all and worth it! Get it!,1313712000,,194,4.416666666666667
8219644,5,B000VS6Q6I,"There are two live sets included on this DVD. Overall I'd give it a 4.5 if I could but I'll round up to be nice.

Maryland: B- There are many good songs in this performance, which is nice. However it suffers from somewhat poor sound quality (at least compared to the Philly show). The mix - especially Oli's lead work in some of the solos, is off and frankly hard to listen to at points. Also, Phil seems a bit more tired than usual. But overall, this band is awesome and the songs make up for the shortcomings in this performance.

Philly: A- This was an excellent show. The sounds quality is noticeably better than the Maryland show (try switching between the two), and they just seem tighter in general. The mix problems have been fixed, and Phil is 100%. It's hard to find much to criticize in this performance - the only things I notice are that Jason still struggles with timing in parts of 'Six', and that 'The Weak Willed' and 'This Calling' are missing from this performance. That's no problem, however, because those songs are on the Maryland show.

Extras: Usually I'm less interested in these, but I found it interesting to ""get to know"" some of the band members and see how down to earth they are, especially in contrast to some of their fans, which is kind of funny.

If you're at all a fan of ATR, I highly recommend this live DVD.",1265068800,2,1346,4.415322580645161

8219646,3,B000VS6Q6I,"Great sound, song quality. I was pleased with the audio.

Video was a joke. It is 2008, and there is no reason/excuse to make a DVD in 4:3 ""fool screen"" aspect ratio. The world has moved to 16:9, and I was pissed that I had to watch the video with huge black pillars on each side. I have a 70"" TV so it could have been worse,",1203984000,3,325,3.8507462686567164
