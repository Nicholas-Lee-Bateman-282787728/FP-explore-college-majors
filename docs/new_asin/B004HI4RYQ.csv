8429541,1,B004HI4RYQ,"Do not buy this DVD.  This DVD does not deserve even One Star, but I am forced to give it that in order to rate it.

It is a collection of only two Mary Miles Minter films.  And both need to be restored!  Both are in the worst condition one can imagine.  When I purchased this DVD I was under the impression that it was crystal clear and had been restored.  It is barely viewable with the light/dark contrast continually shifting and the deterioration of the negative ""flipping"" on you.  Poor Mary.  She deserved better.",1306454400,14,520,4.4
