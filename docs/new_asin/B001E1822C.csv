But they also took a step back by having their own members volunteer to be the proverbial ""dummies"" for the demonstration of how these things worked. Those demonstrations were corny, cheezy and sophomoric but most of all, they wasted so much time that could have, and for all intens and purposes should have, been spent on more devices.",1404777600,,464,4.7407407407407405
8295953,3,B001E1822C,"It was somewhat entertaining but not something I will watch a second time, as I do with other documentary series I own. It was interesting but in the end of each segment one most often feels just a little let down as if it could and should have been more than it was. I was going to write a long review however, several others have covered the points on content very well I had wished to address about the issues with presentation of the material.",1392336000,,447,4.270588235294118
8295954,5,B001E1822C,"this gruesome show! was on a few years back on the history channel. A group  of people recreate famous torture devices from  history. Suprisingly the Iron Maiden was rarely used in history but it's featured here as well. One reason was it was just a killing machine and not much else.  This is a interesting series and you get a 'feel' about how bad the past really was.  Torture and pillaring and such were common place. Women could be put into a head device for complaining too much, which didn't kill them at least.  Kudos to the brave woman who goes under a guillotine in one episode. She has more guts than most people! After all a magician doing a trick with one was killed just twenty years ago.  The dvd looks great visually because it's a newer show , it only ran for one season?. but you do get some great history lessons here , that are pretty ghoulish.  The bull that the king of sicily put people in , was perhaps the worst of them all. But even a iron boot is pretty horrible and evil to think of.  Check this out ,and be grateful for todays justice systems!.",1382572800,2,1073,4.303482587064677
8295955,5,B001E1822C,"This is great DVD for everyone at all ages!  This is very interesting.  You can learn about different ancient punishment devices including the Garrote, the Gallows, and the Rack.  It is interesting to see how does these ancient inventions work and show you how it is being used.  It is really amazing!",1342224000,,301,4.730769230769231
8295956,4,B001E1822C,"The History Channel and craftsman/artisans from the Scarefactory in Columbus, Ohio team up to re-create and test some of the most horrifying execution/torture devices and weapons of the ancient world. Some of the more notable selections include the Halifax Gibbet (a forerunner to the guillotine, in which the victims faced upward toward their impending doom), the Brazen Bull (a metal oven formed into the shape of a bull, with victims being roasted alive), the Judas Cradle (a pyramid shaped pedestal; victims were stripped naked and forcibly lowered down into a sitting position upon the pointed tip of this device), and the Strappado (a favorite torture device of the Inquisition; with arms tied behind their backs, victims were hoisted into the air by ropes tied around their wrists - dislocating arms, damaging tendons, and tearing ligaments).
I enjoyed both the historical information and the creative process involved in making these nightmarish devices. However, when it came to ""testing"" these creations, some of the experiments seemed to fall a bit flat. When they tested devices meant more for humiliation rather than torture (such as the Branks Mask and the Shame Flute) the scenes generally worked well for the episodes. However, because of the obvious dangers of many of the devices, the human test subjects could only go through mock trials with some of the torture implements and weapons, making the re-enactments seem rather pointless. Case in point was the experiment involving the Strappado; they obviously couldn't do a real test that would hyper-extend the subjects arms backward, so they put safety harnesses in place. The narrator tried to spice up the scene by saying (in a seriously toned radio-style voice), ""If it weren't for the safety harnesses in place, Chad's arms would be dislocated from their sockets!"" Gee...fake torture...how frightening... (Yawn). Anyway, I digress. Despite the flaws, I did enjoy the series.

For someone interested in learning about the gruesome history of humiliation/torture/execution devices, this series is a good introduction.",1328659200,,2088,5.365853658536586
8295957,5,B001E1822C,"i remember studying these devices for a history report i had to do and came across this show, the show puts in a lot more detail than what i could find and besides just teaching about how the machine would work it also gives a brief history of why the machines were used. got to admit i learned a lot from this show! a Must See for anyone who is interested in pass devices!",1299369600,2,373,4.054054054054054
8295958,5,B001E1822C,"We read about these instruments of torture, we see their pictures, but watching a video on how they worked is - by far - more impressive. This DVD gets 5 stars because it not only shows how these instruments worked, but also the team's effort in actually building them from scratch and putting them to test (on human subjects too). DVD is a bit too long and repetitive (at some point the comments are exactly the same, only expressed by some other team member).",1284940800,2,461,4.5
