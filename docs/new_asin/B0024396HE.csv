8350245,5,B0024396HE,"The Kapser Holten / Royal Danish Opera production is a curate's egg (mixed bag) until this last opera in the cycle, where it all comes together, triumphantly. The production is dramatically as well as musically thrilling -- fully persuasive that the Ring is as close as we come, in the last couple of hundred years, to Dante's Comedia as a successful achievement of post-classical epic. Wagner's so-called backslidings to the disavowed conventions of Grand Opera are brilliantly vindicated. The production knowingly builds on the Regietheater tradition established by Boulez / Chereau, but to amplify and renew it. If you know and care about the work, it's indispensable; if it's new to you, you'll find it a hair-raising, heart-melting introduction.",1488326400,,750,5.310924369747899
8350246,2,B0024396HE,"Although orchestra and singers sounds fine (nothing close to Solti's cast and VPO impressive powers) this is a horrible version of the last on the Ring's cycle. Siegfried and Brunhilde look old and everything less heroic, and machine guns instead of swords its hard to swallow. This production should have remained as a cheap CD production.",1318291200,,340,5.089285714285714
