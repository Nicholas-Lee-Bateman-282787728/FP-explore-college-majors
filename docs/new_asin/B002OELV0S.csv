8375990,5,B002OELV0S,These versions of the old classics make watching the same thing over and over bearable.  They are witty and entertaining with just enough adult humor to make them not only tolerable but truly enjoyable.  We had rented all three several times when I decided to purchase the set.  They entertain my oldest (14) to my youngest (4) with no loss of interest.  Worth every penny!!  Also received within 3 days which was several days before anticipated delivery.,1301011200,,455,4.857142857142857
8375991,5,B002OELV0S,"I very much enjoyed watching all 3 of these cleverly written stories.  They took classic stories, hit fast forward years later and created something original and fun.  I sat and watch with my kids 5 and 9 and we laughed all the way through.  This is a must buy and a great family pick!!  Can't wait for another one to be made!!!  Can't get enough of Unstable Fables series.",1260230400,,373,4.3478260869565215
