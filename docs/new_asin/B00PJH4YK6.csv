6809034,3,B00PJH4YK6,The price alone is worth it yes rebel without a cause not in it correct the problem and it be perfect,1431820800,2,101,3.857142857142857
6809035,1,B00PJH4YK6,I wouldn't give this one star. Corporate crime as been committed.  Manufacturer defect is they don't have disc 1 to rebel without a cause. You only get special features to rebel without a cause.  And yet they continue to sell it.,1431734400,8,229,4.560975609756097
6809036,1,B00PJH4YK6,"I was initially quite excited to see that Warner Bros. was re-releasing all three of James Dean's film in an affordable and rather compact snapcase edition. However, when the item arrived, I noticed two unfortunate things.

First of all, instead of a divider containing two of the films with the third applied comfortably out back, all three discs were STACKED ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER! The peg which normally holds a single disc was elongated to hold three. This appears to be a horrible solution for manufacturing a cost effective product since the discs would most likely scratch one another with frequent handling.

The second, and admittedly more troubling, realization occurred once I removed the first disc from the stack. It appears that Warner Bros. simply intended to take the first discs of the two special editions released for East of Eden and Rebel without a Cause for inclusion with this set. However, in the process of packaging the set, they managed to select the WRONG DISC of Rebel without a Cause. Thus, instead of receiving all three films, you get East of Eden, Giant, and the special features to Rebel without a Cause but NO THIRD FILM!

When I contacted Amazon about the matter, they were very helpful and immediately sent me a replacement copy, but I encountered the same problem regarding the second film. I contacted Amazon a second time and urged them to look into their inventory.

Until this matter is resolved, I strongly suggest that people look elsewhere before attempting to purchase a copy of this DVD set.",1426464000,25,1538,4.858778625954199

6809038,3,B00PJH4YK6,Discs are piled on top of one another. Rebel without a cause and east of eden play. Having problems with giant. It seemed the improper packaging has caused it to scratch.,1495238400,,170,4.516129032258065
6809039,5,B00PJH4YK6,"This is a good set if you are looking just for the movies and for the price it is definitely a bargain!!  East Of Eden, Rebel Without A Cause and Giant were all included in my set and the DVD's are in excellent shape!",1493942400,2,217,3.9318181818181817
6809040,1,B00PJH4YK6,"There was only 1 actual movie in the box (East of Eden).  There were ""the making of"" clips for Rebel Without A Cause. There was a download certificate for the Rebel Without A Cause and absolutely no mention of Giant!  I was forced to join an on-line service to secure the 2nd movie.  That turned into a nightmare.  Caused me to set up an account I didn't want.  Had to download a utility in order to actually download the movie to my computer and that didn't work well, either.  A waste of money!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Dean-3FF-DVD/dp/B00PJH4YK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Dean 3FF (DVD)</a>",1491609600,,656,5.575757575757576

6809046,1,B00PJH4YK6,"I had to return this item because ""Giant"" would not play properly. It kept stopping and stalling. I'm sure this is because Warner Bros. decided to put this long movie on a 2 sided disc instead of giving it two discs. There is something about 2 sided discs that just mean trouble. How about giving this movie a well-deserved first class DVD treatment.",1474502400,,350,4.571428571428571
