3892918,1,B002B71TU0,This DVD is nothing close to how they marketed it.  Save you money.  A remarkable is cheaper and is the same documentary.  I can not believe I was cheated like that.  This product represents what Michael himself was against.  He loved his fans and wanted to give them their moneys worth not cheat them.,1253750400,4,302,4.518518518518518
3892919,1,B002B71TU0,"This DVD is not as described.  It is not authorized by Jackson. It is the same exact DVD of Remarkable Life.
This is someone trying to make money off of Michael Jackson's death.
Stick with the DVD's that he put out.",1253577600,20,215,4.2439024390243905

3892921,1,B002B71TU0,I can't believe I fell for this one! I have not bought a bad thing on Amazon but I really got taken this time! I can't believe I paid the money I did for this DVD and frankly I am disappointed in Amazon for selling it! Please listen to me and do not waste your money. I was a fool for doing so!,1253577600,10,294,3.6825396825396823
3892922,1,B002B71TU0,"I hated ""A Remarkable Life"" well.. this video is a replica!! I mean literally! They just took A remarkabble life and stuck it in the Never Surrender Cover.  Don't waste your money.  The cover is very deceiving...it is totally misleading...nothing on the cover is on the DVD. DON'T BUY IT!",1253577600,6,288,4.74
3892923,1,B002B71TU0,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!  This CD is an exact copy of:  ""Michael Jackson: A Remarkable Life.""  It is poorly done, and boring!  I'm a huge fan and this CD disappoints me greatly!!!  It has no music or pictures of Michael Jackson.  It is VERY misleading.  I am very angry about this purchase and feel taken by it.

FYI:  According to the CD covers, ""A Remarkable Life"" was done by Chrome Dreams in 2003.  ""Never Surrender"" was supposedly produced by ""Silver and Gold Productions"" in 2009.  It appears that ""Silver and Gold"" just repackaged the CD and is selling it too.  I'm disgustingly disappointed!!",1253404800,29,601,4.728155339805825
3892924,1,B002B71TU0,"It just has the a different cover and no footage as describe. The description is not at all what is on the dvd. Total waste of money. I personally hated A remarkable life, am very unhappy to be fooled into buying it again.",1249171200,88,222,4.186046511627907
8360770,4,B002B71TU0,well...I am surprised to read these negative reviews...I am writing this review almost 5 years after his passing and I personally loved this...it may be a duplicate of another title...BUT>..the content is very endearing and the interviews are great...I don't care for the producer of the Earth SOng videos opinions but that is the ONLY thing I had trouble with...COrrect...there is no MJ music in this...but the footage of MJ is beautiful and some of the interviews are the best out there...stories about their experiences with MJ and so on...I liked it...at this rate the DVD is $.32 and shipping...allso the full length of it is on Youtube...so you can watch it there and decide if it is worthy of adding to your collection...I am glad to have it and enjoy seeing those close to him expound on his virtues and talents...,1399507200,,822,4.795774647887324
8360771,1,B002B71TU0,"This was really bad because when I opened it to watch it , it was the exact video Michael Jackson a remarkable life!!!!!! It was just in a different cover with a different name. I was very disappointed",1367366400,,201,4.315789473684211
8360772,5,B002B71TU0,Michael Jackson was born with a special gift from GOD. He lived his life under a microscope. People critcizing every move he made. He never had a normal life or any privacy. People had an agenda wanting money from him. May he rest in peace in GOD's hands.,1366675200,,255,4.333333333333333
8360773,1,B002B71TU0,"I order this twice and got It A Remarkable Life, twice so I did not get this DVD at all. Do not waste your money on this.

8360774,1,B002B71TU0,"Don't waste your money on this yawner! I'm a hard-core Michael Jackson fan and collect all the film footage of him that I can. But man, did I make a mistake when I ordered ""Never Surrender"". Its 70-minute running time seems like 170 by the time you reach its merciful end. No music, just people I've never heard of telling their stories about Michael. Yes, some of these people worked closely with MJ, but the narrative format is a total bore. The DVD's only redeeming feature is that it has interspaced rare clips of MJ, but even so, it isn't worth the first dollar. I'm embarrassed to even have it in my collection!",1268870400,,617,4.469026548672566
8360775,1,B002B71TU0,"The ""Never Surrender"" DVD has very few good points. First off, little if any MJ music to speak of. Most of the Michael Jackson footage consists of old interviews.

It is worth a look if you want to rent it or check it out from your local library.
Too much time is spent rehashing his time with the Jackson Five.",1268611200,,311,4.183333333333334
8360776,1,B002B71TU0,"This video is a total disappointment to the Michael Jackson fan.  I bought this after having viewed many of the Michael Jackson movies on the market; this is one you should not waste your time or money on.  This and Moonwalker are the only Michael DVDs that I shut off before finishing and have no plan to watch again.

This DVD does not have a lick of Michael Jackson music.  It has a very lame music bank that is repetitive and annoying.  It is a poor attempt at tapping into the Michael Jackson post-death purchases.

As for movies, I would recommend getting History on Film Vol. II and Michael Jackson Video Greatest Hits, if you enjoy his music videos.  I personally, much prefer to watch him in recorded ""live"" concerts.  The Live in Japan and Live in Bucharest DVDs are a must for any hardcore MJ fan.  I provided links below to my recommendations based on your MJ interests.

8360777,1,B002B71TU0,"I didn't think it was possible for a video to be worse than 'A Remarkable Life,"" but I stand corrected because this was one of the most poorly generic pieces of trash that was ever thrown together for money. I am sorry i ever wasted my money.  I ususally want Michael Jackson stories to last forever, but I couldn't wait for this one to end. I will never buy something before reviews of it are posted. Oh, and you just got to love the generic background music. It makes you think you're watching porn. A complete RIPOFF :(",1256083200,3,522,4.326530612244898
8360778,1,B002B71TU0,"As other people have said, it's a total waste of money.  I hadn't seen ""A remarkable life"" but thanks to other reviewers, I now know not to get that either as the two are exactly the same and neither of them are worth the money.

It's just a collection of people I've mostly never heard of, who had some connection with Michael through his work, talking about what they remember about him as though they were close buddy-buddies with him.  Hardly even any pictures of Michael, let alone music.  Looks to me like it's a totally unauthorized piece of junk, put together by some vultures who want to squeeze money out of his name.

Very disappointing!!!",1255219200,6,650,4.568965517241379
8360779,1,B002B71TU0,"This is one of the really bad videos that are currently out there since the passing of our beloved MJ.  Take my word for it, it's absolute JUNK.  First clue to a crappy MJ video is when Sony has nothing to do with it and MJ's music is not on it anywhere(they have to reveal that!)  Please....don't waste your time or money on this...i'll send you mine for free!!!!",1254096000,6,364,4.246376811594203
