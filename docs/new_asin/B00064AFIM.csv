2165628,1,B00064AFIM,"The product itself is fine.  However, I paid for expedited shipping when I ordered it on a Tues because i needed it by Sat.  I was concerned and tried to contact the seller to see when it would be sent.  For 3 days I got NO RESPONSE.  Then on Sat morning, I sent an email asking if it had been shipped yet.  They responded on Sat that it was shipped on Sat and that I could no longer cancel or get my money back.  It finally showed up 8 days later - for expedited shipping.  If you use this seller don't pay for expedited shipping unless you just like wasting your money.  I feel sure I would have gotten it in about the same amount of time without paying DOUBLE for fast shipping.",1266105600,4,681,4.067669172932331
