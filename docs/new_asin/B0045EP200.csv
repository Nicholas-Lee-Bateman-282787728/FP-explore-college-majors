8416616,1,B0045EP200,"The plot made no sense.  The film is incredibly slow moving and has very little action.  It appears that to try and rescue the film, they tacked on a very brief scene of a girl struggling in a pool of water.  You can't tell what she is struggling against or  if she is just having a seizure.  After she drowns, there is a very brief topless underwater scene - 2 seconds long.  There is no other nudity in the film and very little action until the very end which features some super low budget scenes where a girl is attacked by undead flying fish - well the severed heads of fish.  Its even stupider than it sounds.  As for who would enjoy this film - if you enjoy watching mundane scenes of a fish-mongers daughter going on a summer college internship at a marine research facility then you may enjoy this film.  For example, there is a scene where the interns go out on a boat and then go diving presumably for research purposes.  However, its never really explained what they are doing, nothing of interest or significance happens during this dive, and the only reasons for the scene seems to be an excuse to show off the young actresses in bikinis (and like so many other scenes to pad the film so it has a 76 minute running length so that it is movie length and not film short length).",1519516800,,1290,4.3153526970954355
