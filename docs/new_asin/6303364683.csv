I'm sure it would have been a little better if the dubbing had been better but not much. Trying to watch this movie was frustrating and annoying. It has aged very badly---the Beatles-style craziness is inane and very off-putting. Rutger Hauer at his worst...a sleazy ""sex machine.""",1365033600,,422,5.130434782608695
7844620,4,6303364683,"I say surprise because I find it hard to believe that I've never heard mention of this odd, enjoyable film from 1977, and because it's apparently been forgotten to the point where no one has bothered to put it on DVD.  Rutger Hauer plays a guy who is happily in love with his wife when he goes on a six-month sea voyage to earn his Captaincy, only to return home and find that his wife has become a heroin-addicted hooker who wants nothing to do with him.  ""Ricky"" initially responds to this nightmare by becoming an angry, hedonistic animal, who drinks hard, fights hard, looks for trouble wherever he can find it, and who likes to humiliate and physically abuse the women he picks up before tossing them aside.  This goes on and on until he meets a woman who makes him feel again and restores his faith in humanity.  But there is a wrinkle to this new love in Ricky's life.  I'll leave the plot synopsis there and let you find out the rest for yourself.  Hauer is quite effective as Ricky, especially in the character's angry times.  There is cool music, lots of great looking women and lots of motorcycle and sports car scenes.  A welcome surprise.",1153008000,4,1151,4.473684210526316
