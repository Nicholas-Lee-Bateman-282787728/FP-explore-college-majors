8642669,3,B00IJR5E20,Some of the moves were kind of odd. Such as swaying and moving your body how you feel.. it was just a little different for me. But if you want simple yoga for pregnancy this is a decent source.,1524960000,,193,3.9743589743589745
8642670,4,B00IJR5E20,"I enjoyed this exercise DVD during my pregnancy, and it definitely helped for stretching and breathing. I liked the P.M. yoga routine much better than the morning, but this DVD is not for everyone. I don't mind yoga that is more holistic, which this definitely is. If you are looking for a 'regular' yoga routine similar to Hatha or Vinyasa yoga, I wouldn't suggest this.",1496707200,,371,4.723076923076923
8642671,5,B00IJR5E20,"This is a great yoga sequence. I enjoy doing the AM yoga routine to waken my body up especially because as my pregnancy has progressed, my hips are usually quite problematic when I first wake up. Her other prenatal video is far more challenging and a longer sequence, but this is a quick and energetic practice to start the day off. What I love about Sarah's videos is that she brings an element of fun, non-rigid movement to her routines. This is way better than a traditional class with limited ""freestyle"" movement. I highly recommend it!",1483920000,,541,4.645833333333333
8642672,5,B00IJR5E20,"Sarah is the best! This is a great dvd for low key yoga at home. If you're looking for a more rigorous prenatal class, check out her 60 minute dvd or go to one of her lovely classes.",1456272000,,182,3.8157894736842106
8642673,3,B00IJR5E20,"Not a big fan. The sequence is somewhat boring if your used to a challenge or are intermediate/advanced. If your a beginner, however this would be perfect.",1429315200,,155,4.777777777777778
8642674,5,B00IJR5E20,"This is so much better than my other prenatal yoga dvd! It is gentle for my injuries as well as pregnancy, clear to follow and the teacher has a good rhythm to keep me present.",1420934400,2,176,4.057142857142857

8642677,5,B00IJR5E20,Great DVD.  I took training from the woman on the cover and she is a vanguard of the prenatal yoga world.  Excellent teacher and quality video.,1401926400,4,143,4.461538461538462
8642678,5,B00IJR5E20,"Prenatal yoga classes can be dicey. Lots of different approaches and opinions. I have had the pleasure of actually attending Blooma classes at the studio in Minnesota (its worth a trip to the twin cities to visit the studio and experience it live). I have also taken a lot of prenatal yoga classes. This is by far the best (if you can't get in for a live class)
Things I love
- actual useful birth preparation movements that can be used in labour
- empowering positive safe suggestions (she never says don't do blah blah bc you are pregnant)
- 2 different 35 minute practices (if you want a longer class get the other Blooma dvd)
- fluid flowing movements balanced out with strong ones
- accessible to all levels

I am so happy this dvd exists. It is so good I could cry.",1400630400,8,771,4.354166666666667
