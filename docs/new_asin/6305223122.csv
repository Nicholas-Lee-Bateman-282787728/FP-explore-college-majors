The casting department really did their job well for this film) You will love all the characters, from Jimmy the dishonest struggling actor, Minor the thug wanna-be, Fatty the bookie who happens to be whipped by his wife, and my personal favorite, Simon the Jewish Santa. (Played by Dean Cameron, what a surprise :) This is a great film! Buy it!",1017100800,4,482,4.616279069767442
992453,4,6305223122,"What a great movie!
If you like 'dialouge' movies, definitely see this one!  The script is clever and has a very New York feel to it.  I forewarn everyone that this is not a screwball comedy.
I repeat, this is not a screwball comedy.
It does have comic moments, but the goal of this movie is not to have you on the floor laughing.  The goal is simply to show you a day in the life of 'average' New Yorkers, and to point out that honesty is the best policy.
To fully enjoy the film, I suggest you just sit back and relax, enjoy the comedy, enjoy the drama, enjoy the dialouge.",989971200,6,575,4.116071428571429
7885518,4,6305223122,"Once in a while they get it right! The right director, the right story and the right cast. Here is an example of that rightness. it is very hard for me to single out any one or two performance but I will try. Eric Stoltz finally getting out of that goody two shoes, aw shucks thing and is GREAT. Campbell Scott is running the entire spectrum of emotions. The entire cast is SUPERB in this cute and sometimes very funny movie. Eric needs money, his girlfriend tries to get it from her brother who tries to collect all the money owed to him all over town and everyone is given a different reason for the need for the money. Pregnancy? Gambling debts? Oh, peter riegert is terrific too. How will it end up well has to at the Hi Life bar and grill. (and you thought it was about something else!)",1460851200,,791,4.245033112582782

7885521,5,6305223122,Love this movie. Its funny and uplifting and all the stars in are great. I love the way the actors joke and interact with each other and the fact its set at christmas time.,1370131200,,172,4.088235294117647
7885522,4,6305223122,"I originally panned this movie, but on subsequent viewing, I like it!  The low point is an appearance  by Peter (Hey, I was in Animal House!) Riegert.  The high points are Campbell Scott's crisp performance, and a GLITTERING performance by the late Katrin Cartlidge!",1363824000,,266,5.0

7885524,1,6305223122,That was 1 hour and 26 minutes of my life that I will never get back.  What a waste of my time.  The plot was incredibly annoying.,1351641600,3,130,3.7777777777777777
7885525,4,6305223122,"If you, like me, think of Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and The Ref are a great way to ring in the season, grab this movie. It has humor for anybody to enjoy, and cajoles the seasonal curmugeon in all of us. It is a semi-chick flick, but guys should like it too.",1329609600,,257,3.9615384615384617
7885526,4,6305223122,"This is a GREAT little indie.  It has a fairly simple plot which sends the characters running around NYC one night at Christmas time - each with his or her own misunderstanding of what is going on.  The dialogue is warm and witty and the actors are wonderful.  There is not one bad perfomance in this film.  Campbell Scott and the late Katrin Cartlidge make a very enagaging duo as they spar and flirt their way through the evening.  Eric Stoltz is a great warm-hearted heel and Kelly gets a chance to deliver some great one-liners and zingers that give her character a real zest. This is the kind of small, sweet, funny film that doesen't get made that often and when they do - rarely this well.  Spend and hour and a half with this one and make some new friends.  I have honestly ended up curled up on the couch watching this more times than I ever imagined.  Get it!",1049500800,6,869,4.320987654320987
7885527,4,6305223122,"I watched this movie ...and once it finished I decided I had to log on to Amazon and buy it up.  This film is so well done, from the characters, the actors, the dialogue and the stories.  A pure enjoyment to watch. I hope everyuone sees it at least once.",1037923200,4,254,4.06
