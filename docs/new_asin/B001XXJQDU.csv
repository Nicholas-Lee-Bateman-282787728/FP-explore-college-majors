So much better than just listening to music. actually seeing them perform as they did back then... priceless. at first, I thought the price was high. but after watching them. the quality. the original songs in video, just wonderful. I changed my mind. how much is too high for great memories.. my husband just keeps thanking me for getting them. says they take him back to when he was a boy.you can't put a price on that.",1414800000,4,493,4.488888888888889
3829546,5,B001XXJQDU,"I was hating the idea of spending over a hundred bucks to buy ""Opry Video Classics"", but I really wanted to see it and couldn't find any way to borrow or rent it, so I went looking for the cheapest way to buy it.  I didn't expect to find the price at Time-Life's website to be competitive with Amazon, etc. but I thought I'd give 'em a try.  So imagine my surprise when I get to their site (with a coupon I found online) and they ask me ""WHICH VERSION"" I want- the original 8 DVD set or the EXTENDED 16 DVD SET?!
I'd never even heard of this!  Well, as a service to the classic country lovers of the world, I bit the bullet and gave it a try.

So now let me tell you, there is nothing inferior about this set!  It's in a box that compliments the first set perfectly, the cases and discs are made to the same standard, the only thing I will say is the original set has a few short interviews and an introduction that is not on the second set discs, but there the difference ends- the music and video are the same quality, and the selections are a perfect continuation.  I don't have the list with me at the moment but the discs are mostly a ""second"" volume of discs in the first set- ""Legends 2"", ""Queens of Country 2"", ""Pioneers 2"", ""Songs That Topped the Charts 2"", that sort of thing, but there are a couple that don't follow that pattern- there's a ""Kings of Country"" for example.

I've watched six discs out of the whole double set so far, the ""Legends"", ""Queens"", and ""Pioneers"", both 1 and 2.  I probably will offer them for sale after I've watched them all a couple times, but I don't know how to get people's attention that this is a DOUBLE set, since info on the set is so rare on the internet.

Here's the disc case notes and track listing for the second extended part:

Opry Video Classics presents the greatest collection of vintage live country music performances ever assembled.  Most of these historic recordings have never before been available commercially.  This series offers fans a first-class ticket to Nashville to experience the golden age of country music  from the '50s to the '70s  and witness the evolution of a sound that still resonates today.

If you already have the first set, you'll miss Marty Stuart's informative introductions, but the content is pure country music history, allowing a look back at the stars who were writing and performing the best country songs of the 50's and 60's.
