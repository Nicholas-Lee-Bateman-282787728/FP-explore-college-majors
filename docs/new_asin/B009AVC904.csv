5309803,5,B009AVC904,"I am surprised by the negative reviews, I actually liked Ms. Austin's new DVD.  I have a few others (Boot Camp, Hot Body Yoga), so I am familiar with D.A's style. I think this one is probably my new favorite.  Are some of the exercises similar to moves in her other DVDs, some yes, are some of the moves challenging, YES!  I think Denise does a great job incorporating multiple muscle groups in each exercise.  I really felt the core getting a workout through the ENTIRE DVD.  My favorite segment was the lower body portion.  I just loved the ballet-inspired moves.  While the DVD features 7 separate workouts, I choose to do them all back to back.  In the 58 minutes, I burned close to 600 calories, which I assume would have been higher had I been more familiar with the moves. The moves are not high impact at all, and if proper attention is paid to form, they don't cause any pain or discomfort.  The calorie burn I got is similar to what I get when doing higher impact workouts within the similar time frame (i.e. Turbojam, Turbofire, Chalean Extreme).  Now while this DVD certainly will not entirely replace my other programs I do, it is certainly great for a day that I don't want to push myself to the edge, or want a little variety.  I will be recommending it to all my fitness friends!",1357430400,81,1295,4.421940928270042
5309804,1,B009AVC904,"I got this one for Christmas from collage video as it was listed as beginner/intermediate and the video clip looked like I could handle it.  I could not do about half of the moves due to my back and fibro and it about killed me trying to keep up with the constantly changing moves!  I think it is mislabeled and should be listed intermediate/advanced for the ab moves that are not good for those of us who have bad backs.  I sent it back.  I am not buying any more Denise Austin workouts as she is too hard for a 63 year old grandma with fibro and severe arthritis in the back!  I used to be able to do her workouts and still can do her older ones, but this one is the pits.",1357084800,4,674,4.0
5309805,4,B009AVC904,"however, if you have other Denise Austin DVDs this product does not offer much new in the way of actual exercise moves. It really is specialized to design workouts ranging from 7 to 56 minutes in length.  I did the whole DVD to get a total body workout and the sweat was pouring down my face.  That being said, I will not likely use this as my go to DVD as I prefer an integrated 20-40 minute workout without breaks in between.",1354924800,13,427,4.195121951219512

I use her yoga or Pilates video first, then add on the seven minute upper body routine to the end of my workout. After just doing this a few times, I can already see my upper body is tighter and leaner. She makes it fun and always keeps things light and moving.",1464393600,2,424,4.0

I'm  probably intermediate to advanced.",1456099200,,335,4.203125

5309889,4,B009AVC904,"I really love Denise Austin although I know she is not for everyone, I APPROVE! She is a positive role model for all of us. This particular video is not my favorite only because of the absence of her pilates/ yoga moves. I REALLY love her pilates and yoga dvd.

5309894,5,B009AVC904,"I bought this CD as a backup to the online video. It is exactly like it.

I find the workouts excellent and love the short intervals. You can repeat if you want but I usually choose a couple to do especially the toning. The aerobic excecises are just the time intervals that are perfect for working out at home.

My favorite is the arm toning. I can really see a difference in my shoulders. Pretty soon I am going to look like Venus Williams in that area. Well, a smaller version of Venus. But, truthfully, there are other workouts that target certain areas better but these are perfect for beginners.",1436140800,5,601,4.454545454545454

She is a very positive person and I am on the negative side, so after a workout with her I feel happy.  I like the way she breaks up most of her DVDs into segments so you can do a little or a lot.  This is a great addition to my Denise collection, although I must give a shout out to my all time favorite 21 Days to a Yoga Body!",1394409600,2,434,3.842696629213483

Other than those two each work out is 7 minutes and focuses on either abs/core, upper or lower body segments. Denise has a great way of incorporating stretching and rotation into all her workouts and I love her for that and for the fact that each workout manages to be challenging as well as gentle.",1385769600,4,513,4.410526315789474

Most fitness dvd's will take a few goes before you get the moves down pat and this is no exception but I found I was sweating a bit and I love the way she doesn't stay on the same thing for too long, unlike say Jillian Michaels who will do a lot of reps of the one movement.

It really fits your schedule and allows flexibility in your workout.  7 minutes may seem like a joke - but our motto is 'something is better than nothing and sometimes is better than never'.  With this DVD, we can customize the workout and do 7 minutes, 30 minutes or the whole thing.  In most cases, we do at least 30 minutes.  The customization is the best - allows you to select what you want to do and how much.  Some of the moves are 'dance-like and girlie' - but my husband didn't care - as long as he was sweating!  The 7 minute intervals are nice too - short break between each one.  Most of the exercises are standing - lots of lunges.",1367020800,8,746,4.061643835616438
5310061,5,B009AVC904,Love this dvd. do all 7 minutes workouts at once do this workout once a week do her other workouts 4 other days,1365465600,,111,3.869565217391304
5310062,4,B009AVC904,As with most of her workouts this one is great.  It hits all areas from head to toe all in a short period of time. Great for those of us who are so busy on a day to day basis.,1365120000,19,175,3.375
5310063,5,B009AVC904,"This great variety aerobics and toning workout. Lunges are not for me, since knee surgery, but the overall fitness routines are great.",1364774400,,134,5.136363636363637
5310064,3,B009AVC904,Ok exercise video.  I definitely sweated a littlle.  But I did not become engaged enough to keep using it.  That could just be me. :),1362355200,,133,4.24
5310065,4,B009AVC904,This is my first exercise video so I have nothing else to compare it to. I like the option to customize the workout choosing one or more of the 7 minute segments. I've been out of the exercise world for several years and found this easy to follow and a good challenge for this senior citizen.,1361923200,26,292,4.232142857142857
5310066,3,B009AVC904,"I really like Denise Austin's style of ""coaching,"" but these workouts were very hard on my arthritic knees. Overall, not a bad choice.",1361750400,,134,4.869565217391305
5310067,5,B009AVC904,I always get the most out of Denise Austion workout videos. I have been working out to her videos for 20 years now and I am always satisfied. The video is easy to follow and when I get done I feel like I have done a great workout,1361145600,3,229,3.7916666666666665

5310069,5,B009AVC904,This is wonderful!  I just love it!  I love the fact that it is only 7 minutes for each workout.  I am so untoned and out of shape and I am going to use the cardio 7 minute workout for a week until I can do it easily and then add the Cardio 2 workout.  It is fast moving yet not annoyingly so.  She is cute and gives good instructions.  I am glad I got this.,1359504000,34,358,3.6447368421052633
5310070,5,B009AVC904,"Every exercise DVD I own is Denise Austin.  This one is the best all around.  I love it.  There's two cardio workouts, two all over body toner workouts, lower body, upper body and abs and they are all great.  You can do all of them or if you're short on time a few of them.  There is no excuse not to exercise with this one.  I think it's great for all fitness levels.  I'm an avid exerciser and have been for years and I get a great workout from this DVD.  I know lots of other reviewers will comment on Denise's bad cuing and being over perky, but I really prefer her over other instructors.  I would highly recommend this.  Love it!",1357948800,60,635,4.131147540983607
8538758,4,B009AVC904,"If you are middle aged and starting from fitness ground zero (as I am) be gracious with yourself and go easy.  The routines are easy to follow, but kind of challenging and it's easy to go from ""good workout"" to ""wow am I sore"".  I suggest modifying anything ""too hard"" till you are more fit, which is what I did.

I hate repetitive workouts, so these videos of hers with lots of options and customization are great!",1527120000,,415,4.363636363636363

8538762,3,B009AVC904,I found this DVD to be very hard to follow.  Denise moves from one move to another so quickly and if you are not familiar with the moves she is doing it is hard to keep up.  By the time you figure out what she is doing she is on to something else.  If you keep doing this over and over and over I would imagine you could finally be in sync with her. It looks like a good workout if you can learn the moves but I wish she would explain better what she is doing.,1500595200,2,460,3.7216494845360826
