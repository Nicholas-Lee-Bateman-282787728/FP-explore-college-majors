7333306,3,B011ID1BRI,"Molly Moon & The Incredible Book of Hypnotism is based on the book of the same name.  There's actually quite a few books in the series so there likely will be sequel movies down the track as well.  Basically Molly is an orphan who isn't popular with the mean old headmistress or whatever orphanages used to call the woman in charge.  She is also bullied by the other children her own age, except for a boy called Rocky, who is her best friend.  There seem to be some younger kids there, who are mostly there to look out a window and shout with enthusiasm ""Molly is back!"", at various times throughout the film but no infants, which is kind off odd when Molly and others seem to have been there their whole lives, so you'd imagine there would be a constant intake in an alternative world where orphanages still exist in first world countries. Like your stereotypical orphanages of kids movies, the Hardwick House Orphanage is a huge historic house (probably worth a fortune), with a lot of shadows inside, dull looking grey brick with arch ways and the kids all wear grey and other non bright clothing.  There are of course strict rules, ensuring nothing fun happens for anyone.

Molly of course likes to break those rules, one of which is sneaking off to the town library where she one days overhears an irate man who came all the way from London to borrow the last edition in existence of The Incredible Book of Hypnotism.  That book just happens to be on the floor nearby where Molly hides under blankets (assumabley from the headmistress).  So she steals it and runs out the door.  The irate man of course sees her, follows her and sees a help wanted sign on the orphanage gate.  Molly sets about hypnotizing the staff and making the orphanage a better place but has neglected to keep her promises to her best friend, who humiliated jumps at the chance to be adopted and out of her life.  She goes to London to find him and along the way decides she'd like to have the life of famous singer/dancer teen, even though she has no talent, she knows her new powers can make that happen.  But can they make her happy?

This is a movie that is sort of like a Saturday morning kids show in its realism.  Even though bad people do things like rob a bank with machine guns, they don't ever at any time seem like they would harm a child. They also aren't very bright bumbling fool types you regularly see in kids movies. In fact most adults in the movie aren't very bright and are very superficial.  Being a pop star and the whole entertainment world is very simplified, as are other non orphanage real world's that Molly encounters for the first time.  Most scenes including the ending lack much substance.  But still it's a decent enough movie, and isn't one of those kids movies that you as an adult can't sit through.  Goes for just over an hour and half.",1461628800,2,2851,4.460500963391137

7333308,5,B011ID1BRI,"I enjoyed this book from the beginning through the end.  I enjoyed the book so much that I purchased the movie.  As with many stories made into books, the movie version tends to change things a bit and thus looses somewhat.  Being a fan of Raffey Casidy helped the movie version.  Generally the story is so good that both the book form and movie form are excellent and deserved to be read and/or watched.",1456617600,4,404,4.418918918918919
7333309,3,B011ID1BRI,"Molly (Raffey Cassidy) is an orphan at the Hardwick House where things are not joyful. She is friends with Rocky (Jadon Carnelly Morris) who gets adopted and leaves. Molly obtains a book on hypnotism and manages to visit Rocky and become a star far beyond her talent.

The theme of the film is unorthodox families and to believe in oneself. There is the formula clumsy crook after the book with his mother played by Joan Collins whose Botox face doesn't belong on screen anymore.

Appears to be geared at kids 7-9 years old.",1451088000,2,524,4.623655913978495

8724306,5,B011ID1BRI,Cute movie (NOT an academy award winner for sure) for anyone that loves the book series. Daughter was disappointed that no sequel or series is being made.,1519084800,,154,4.7407407407407405
8724307,5,B011ID1BRI,"Molly Moon, the cutest orphan who ever lived, learns how to get people to do her bidding by hypnotizing them.  When she learns how to hypnotize crowds and TV audiences things really get interesting.  Raffey Cassidy is very charming in the title role.  The movie is lots of fun and Im pretty sure young girls, among others, will thoroughly enjoy it.  I did.",1508803200,,356,4.603174603174603

8724310,5,B011ID1BRI,Nice fantasy. The book for kids was probably a better format. Imagination is always better.,1490400000,,91,5.133333333333334
8724311,5,B011ID1BRI,"Well, I've read the other reviews and have to add mine.  I am a grandmother of two girls and did watch this movie twice from my DVR, with my six year old granddaughter.  She was thrilled with the story (hence the second time around).  What was incredibly cute was upon her return home, and  learning she followed her Daddy around the house with widened eyes, asking him periodically if her eyes were green!  Granddad and I, after providing the background the story, told the ""adult"" to fake it and act hypnotized!  Honestly, where is the pretend world anymore for our kids?  Is it an Oscar winning movie? No.  Is it entertaining for this age group?  Yes, very much so.  Is this a spin off of the old orphanage theme?  Of course.  But the hypnotism is a newer angle and its kept my granddaughter riveted.  Green eyes indeed.

I'm buying some of the books and the DVD so she can prolong the mystery of hypnotism (besides encouraging her to read more about it!) Will make a great birthday gift.",1476835200,2,991,4.49438202247191
