1218632,1,B00000I1ZD,"I never thought Troma would ... me, but here I stand ...ed. This movie has no real zombie action, as the back cover may explain, but don't fall for it! This movie isn't even funny. I sold this to wherehouse music and got a total of four dollars out of it! 'Nuff said! In the end, I guess we all get ...ed.",1041379200,,305,3.935483870967742
1218633,5,B00000I1ZD,"Buttcrak is brilliant! Wade is very loveable and funny. Mojo was also great, and contributed some great songs to this movie also like the ""poontango"". if you like to laugh and you like gore check this movie out! from troma....of course.",1019347200,,236,4.780487804878049
1218634,5,B00000I1ZD,"Mojo Nixon RULED as the Preacher - this movie had a LOT of cool lines - ""Is he [Satan] in urine?"" ""The Bible doesn't cover zombie resurrections!"" and more - totally side-grabbing, stitch-in-the-stomach laughs, a real party film!",977875200,,228,5.026315789473684
7909265,2,B00000I1ZD,it is a b-movie but what other revews didn't not say is that you can watch this on youtube for free,1468195200,,99,3.761904761904762
7909266,5,B00000I1ZD,"Let's just say this is not academy award material. I watched this on a whim as a friend of mine had watched it and recommeneded it.

I was not disappointed.

This movie is bad. But it's bad in that good way. The acting was bad, but not in a way that was intentional like in ""Cadavera"" where the intentional bad acting/bad movie didn't work. Buttcrack! delivered bad acting, but in a good way. It looks and feels like a movie that was made on a low budget by friends trying their best to have fun making a movie. While the acting was bad, but you can tell they enjoyed making the movie.

The radio scene was the best, and Wade's intentional annoying-ness was funny.

I laughed alot in this movie.

Buy it for a GOOD ""bad"" movie!",1408579200,,727,4.2773722627737225
7909267,5,B00000I1ZD,"This is definitely one of the worst movies ever made. I could not believe I sat through the whole thing. But an hour later I started to laugh uncontrollably at some of the stuff that was in there. That is the mark of a great story. I watched it again and it came through. This is a great comedy, the second time around.",1395446400,,319,4.079365079365079
7909268,4,B00000I1ZD,"What can I say about a movie with Mojo Nixon, horrible, almost porn-like acting, and a storyline probably written on the back of a napkin while some guys were out of their mind at 2 in the morning... This movie is great! I laughed the whole time and can't get the stupid songs out of my head since watching it. My wife did not appreciate it very much, but those of you who have a sense of humor, and like really badly done b-movies, will love this movie.",1248220800,,454,4.170454545454546
7909269,1,B00000I1ZD,"Are you serious Jim Larsen??????? A buttcrack turning people into zombies? I thought I'd seen it all until I watched this god awful movie. Jim(Larsen) must be about 10 years old to think of such a plot. Maybe next we can have killer poop from outspace or some dumb crap like that. Hey maybe I just came up with the next horror/comedy movie.

Is there really any point to this film? No there isn't. It is without a doubt the dumbest thing and dumbest movie I've ever seen. Just save your time and money. This movie is unintelligent, dull and boring. If this movie interests you, go watch your own buttcrack for 90 minutes and you'll save some money.",1124928000,,648,4.445378151260504
7909270,4,B00000I1ZD,"this movie is pure genious,extremely low budget, with no zombies and no gore like it should have. Just an amazing BUTT CRACK. Mojo Nixon is aweseome. This movie is so damn funny i couldn't stop laughing. What is really cool is the horrible acting and and the 80's scenery with the hair cuts and clothes this movie is a classic. What do you expect from TRoma. An ass crack that turns people into zombies.",1119398400,,403,4.45945945945946
7909271,5,B00000I1ZD,"A few months back I stumbled upon a review for this movie, and thought to myself there is no way someone would actually make a movie about turning into a zombie if you stare at some dead hillbilly's buttcrack.  Boy was I wrong.

Aside from that, I can tell you that there aren't many other movies that make me laugh BEFORE the dialogue actually begins.  That opening song ""very sexy man"" should have been the most requested song of 1999.  I mean how many other songs contain the line ""swing my hairy buttocks to and fro!""?

Though this movie was made in 1999 Brian, Wade's roommate, dressed like it was 1984.  Go Billy Idol!  Well Wade is content to sit in his room and play Atari, from the music it sounded like Pole Position or Miner 249er.  But his buttcrack disgusts Annie, Brian's girlfriend, so Brian kills him by ""accidentally dropping the radio in the bathtub after Wade was almost assaulted by Brian's homosexual friend.  Along the way you meet other interesting individuals such as Preacher man Bob, who should have been shot 436,000 times for his idiocracy in this movie.  Then there is his sister, who by the way the borrowed from the set of Witches of Eastwick.  And finally perhaps the greatest actor of all time, Kris Arnold, the dude who actually plays two parts in the movie.  The guy in the Trans Am who threw a can at Wade for not pulling his pants up, and then the mourner at Wade's funeral who says ""A-men"" like a retard.  His other line ""was sup Baby"" actually made me cry I was laughing so hard.  If you've seen the movie you understand.

So in conclusion, I am actually baffled at how this movie didn't beat out American Beauty for Best Picture, hey; I think it is a close rival to Citizen Kane.",1112659200,,1719,4.447284345047923
7909272,4,B00000I1ZD,"Watch this movie with friends, and you will never, ever forget Wade, aka BUTTCRACK. The acting in this movie is bad, and the script is pretty bland except for the raspy comments of Wade, which are totally classic.

Don't pay $17.98 for it, though, that's for sure. It's worth having around, but not for more than ten or twelve dollars.",1099872000,,335,4.583333333333333
7909273,2,B00000I1ZD,"This movie dares you to watch it. It revolves around a mentally slow fat guy who always shows loads of offensive buttcrack. There is an evil redneck and girlfriend duo, who after Buttcrack dies are haunted by the Buttcrack zombie thanks to a voodoo priestess. If anyone sees the buttcrack of death, they will become a zombie, too (obviously). Eventually a priest gets involved and resolves everything back to some semblance of normality. Anyhow, I think I have all that right: honestly I was so bored I found it difficult to pay very close attention.
I watched this movie somewhat against my will, so there exists a possibility that I was biased against it to begin with, but despite the entertaining title and premise (you have to admit that the concept of a buttcrack zombie is pretty funny) I didn't really find the film very funny or entertaining. I guess I am glad I can say I have seen it, but once is enough buttcrack for me.",1082073600,,932,4.586826347305389
7909274,2,B00000I1ZD,"Starts off about two room mates, some country boy and a fat idiot. Appearently the hick and his girlfriend are sick of looking at the mongloids buttcrack. But he dies and his voodoo sister ressurects him back to life as a buttcrack zombie to seek revenge on the hick and his girlfriend. If anyone looks at his booty, they turn into zombies. So some priest goes nuts and kills them all and the voodoo chick.
The movie doesn't really have too much zombie action or even zombies if it is what you are expecting. However the movie was very entertaining in it's own way even though I gave it 2 stars (they're TROMA, what'd you expect).  Hardly any gore, a dumb plot, DVD has a billion of extras, still worth a purchase at a reasonable price.",1063411200,,736,4.411764705882353
