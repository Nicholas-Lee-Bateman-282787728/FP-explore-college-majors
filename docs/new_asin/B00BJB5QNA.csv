8569486,5,B00BJB5QNA,"Paresh Rawal's 'Table No. 21' is a beautiful movie. It came out at the very start of 2013, the same time as 'Rajdhani Express'.

A financially struggling lower-middle class couple win a trip to a Fiji resort, which they readily take. Then Paresh Rawal as Mr. Khan offers them to appear on his game show, where contestants have to do things they find repulsive in order to win 21 crore (a lot of money, basically).

Sure, at first they have to kiss in public, then they have to eat non-veg, which they hate, and the money rolls into the bank account. But as things keep going, it's obvious that something strange is happening, and things are quite right. After a while, the couple want to leave, desperately, but Mr. Khan keeps them under wraps. He seems to know more about them than they do.

As the game goes on it becomes more and more intrusive into the couples' lives and more repugnant, and the more danger there is associated with leaving. But what is really going on here will be a big shock to everyone involved (there is a clue earlier when you see a bucket of paint falling).

The movie works as a romance, as suspense and social commentary is thick and fast, and only at the very end, after the movie has ended does it seem a little 'preachy' rather than entertaining, but a good social message. A thought-provoking and emotional film.",1375660800,3,1346,4.504098360655738
