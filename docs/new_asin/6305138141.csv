7885372,4,6305138141,"A very enjoyable episode.  One moment, everything is going normal (if you can call anything on Star Trek normal), then...everything stops. Literally.  Well, Troi gets freaked out by seeing Capt. Picard, Data, and Geordi LaForge turned into life like sculptures.  Of course, they don't notice it when they start up again, but Troi tells them and of course, it's another investigation.  When our heroes (who are in a runabout, which is really neat since you don't see those that often in TNG) rendevous with the Enterprise, they see their ship with a Romulan Warbird in what appears to be a pitched battle in still life.  Of course, they have to figure out what's going on, but I won't give away the ending (except that it is, as usual, a happy one).  One thing that is fun is to watch the frozen characters on both the Enterprise and Romulan Warbird and see if they move, which they do.  It's kinda fun to say, ""Oops, he/she moved.""  You won't notice if you're caught up in the plot, which is pretty interesting and the acting is excellent.  A bit of psychological thriller and it can be quite eerie at times.  A very good one to watch.",1157328000,,1135,4.54679802955665
7885373,4,6305138141,"While returning to the Enterprise in a shuttle, Picard, Data, La Forge and Troi take turns being momentarily frozen in time.  They are in an area of space pocketed with temporal distortions.  When they get to the Enterprise there is a warp core breach in progress, which has something to do with a nearby Romulan warbird and, in turns out, aliens from another continuum.  Picard and his cohorts have to figure out the mystery before every goes ""ka-boom.""  ""Timescape"" is an average STNG episode, with some interesting variations on temporal distortions, but the series has done much better (e.g., ""Cause and Effect,"" the classic Episode 119).",986342400,,642,5.028301886792453
7885374,5,6305138141,"I think that Timescape is a wonderful episode due greatly to the fact that it more realist than most episodes.  Now of course I like all of the episodes being a trekker and all, but sometimes the science is a bit looney.  This episodes only science flaw was the ability to isolate the crew so well, but I guess it had to be done to keep the show interesting.  Still, science aside, the acting was the most important part, you really could feel the tension and the surprise of the crew when they found the Enterprise frozen in time, {well slowed way way down at least} and because of that I keep watching it over and over again.  The plot is also excellent, with complexities being added in every ten minutes or so, thus keeping you suspence about what is actualy happening.  All in all an excellent performance and definantly worth buying.",983145600,6,839,4.493421052631579
7885375,3,6305138141,"This is a rather intruguing episode about what we consider to be the natural progression of time, and how we sometimes view it as going too fast or too slow. While Picard and company are returning to the Enterprise from  a mission, Troi suddenly sees the rest of the crew on the shuttlecraft  freeze.  Later on, when the crew returns to the Enterprise, they notice  that their ship was fired upon by a Romulan Warbird, but it's frozen in  time!  What will happen to the Enterprise once time is restored to its  normal progression?",961804800,4,530,4.574468085106383
