""Short Circuit"" and its sequel were top-of-the-line 1980s sci-fi/romantic comedy fare that helped define that unique genre.  I loved these movies, which delved into the not-so-unique question of what constitutes 'life.'  Johnny-Five gains consciousness through a freak accident, and his adventures are a fun romp as he tries to escape the scrap pile with the help of the human stars of the film.",1449532800,,514,5.168674698795181

4953441,4,B0064SVO9I,"I got this one for the first movie and haven't seen the Short Circuit 2 disc yet, so this review is essentially 1/2 the collection. I will update when I do get a chance to view it. Still I got this one because it was a better buy with the two films at about $6.50 per disc. These discs are the exact same ones as on the individual releases so you aren't getting a single disc with two movies on them or a cut rate copy of each. All the same features are in this collection. Now on to Short Circuit:

This is a light-hearted fish-out-of-water themed movie about a military robot who got its programming scrambled, now desiring data input. The robot, Number 5 (or Johnny Five later in the film), befriends Stephanie (Ally Sheedy) while the company that designed him are out looking for him. In Number 5's search for more and more data it starts to build an identity and even consciousness. The robot designers (Steve Guttenberg and Fisher Stevens) eventually come to the aid of Number 5 in trying to prevent the company security detail from destroying it.

The story is a bit simplistic in that the threat comes from a lack of communication and understanding of the situation, but then again that happens all too often in real life as well. What I like on this conflict is how it is handled. The security chief (G. W. Bailey) brings up good points on why he would rather destroy the robot than retrieve it. A detail like that helps keep the conflict plausible, but really it's just there to keep the pacing up and move the plot along. The movie's real focus is the comedy. Number 5's interpretation of the world and how it interacts is the name of the game. The jokes are witty and the physical comedy is enjoyable as well. To see Number 5's various capabilities represented in a humorous fashion make the movie interesting just by wanting to see what the robot does next.

Technically the design of Number 5 is excellent. It's one of the few robot designs that looks completely possible, even in the 80's. What's better is how they were able to use puppet wizardry to make you believe you are actually seeing a robot perform on the screen. Especially at that time. Many people just assumed it was all a remote control robot the actions and designs were so good. This alone is a good enough reason for any sci-fi/robot fans to watch this film.

So the movie is ultimately enjoyable, but not without it's downsides. This being an 80's film there are some stereotypical 80's stuff going with some unbelievably odd physical comedy and other little tells that they are trying too hard to be ""hip"" and/or funny in places it simply does not work. Also the dubbing in the movie is pretty obvious and could have used more refinement. Above all the movie is dated. While the robot is really cool, and they do a great job featuring it the reset of the film just screams the 80's. Still as a light comedy there is more to enjoy than not.

Acting on this film is... sketchy. It's not that the actors can't act. It's just the movie seemed to use the 80's typecast model and got actors who didn't fit their part. Ally Sheedy was alright as the naive and sweet Stephanie, but since she has done so many similar roles before it's hard not to separate the character from the actor. Steve Guttenberg has the chops for comedy, but as a computer and robotics engineering geek he absolutely can't sell it. Every time to does the geek dialog it falls flat. Fisher Stevens plays someone of apparent Indian descent. While the character itself isn't a racial stereotype other than having an odd relationship with the English language I can't help but feel odd about the fact a white actor is playing the role. G. W. Bailey is another actor that plays to his typecast, but it does work in this film to an extent.

As stated before this is the exact same Blu-Ray disc as was on the individual release. That also means all the limitations are there too. While it's still looks a lot better than the DVD version you will see inconsistencies. Some scenes are clean and vibrant with color while others are duller. Almost like a different film stock was used in those scenes and it transferred the same way. Also the Blu-Ray is in 1080i resolution instead of 1080p. The difference is the ""i"" stands for interlaced, which is like saying you get two images chopped up that move fast together to make it look hi-def. I usually equate 1080i to the same resolution as 780p, which is still a nice high-def picture. Just not the best. Audio is DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless soundtrack. I don't recall the movie released with surround sound so I believe this is a post-produced track, but it does sound pretty nice sound presence with the additional speakers. Better still the dialog isn't drowned out and has a solid center speaker presence. You get a decent selection of extras, mainly the same stuff from the DVD. All of it is in standard definition, but you get a fair amount for an 80's movie:

Commentary - The director and writers give a thorough commentary throughout the film touching on tons of various little tidbits about the making of the film.

Behind the Scenes Featurette - This is a very brief feature on the filming of the movie. Like a couple minutes short.

The Creation of Number 5 - This was a short feature made back in the 80's on the design and filming of the pivotal robot. It's half promo real and half informational.

Interviews - Another retro-featurette. These are separate interviews with various cast and crew that were made in the 80's. The interviews with the actors and director are pretty short and run at a few minutes. However there is an interview with robot special effects supervisor and conceptual artist Syd Mead that are longer and more interesting.

Biographies and Press Kits - These are the original text pages from the DVD showing actor, writer and director profiles. Plus you get production notes based on the original 1986 press kids and a photo gallery.

Short Circuit is a fun little film that shouldn't be taken seriously. It's not great comedy or sci-fi, but it's good enough. Though I haven't viewed SC2 yet I am told it's not as good as the first, but not bad. The disk for Short Circuit 2 has no special features and has the same 1080p and two channel uncompressed LPCM 2.0 stereo track like the single release of the movie.",1429056000,,6332,4.544736842105263

Alley Sheedy and Steve Guttenburg are at their funniest as Alley finds a robot originally built for the military by everyone except its creator Steve. She thinks it's a alien at first but soon find out it was a robot made by "" War Mongers"". This robot is brought to live when struck by lightening. Its hilarious as the robot #5 seeks to ad ""input"" to his memory and keep away from NOVA and any one seeking out the money as a reward. It has to prove that it really is alive, but will anyone believe it. This is great entertainment for the whole family. I really haven't heard anyone who disliked this movie.  Short Circuit 2 is almost as good as the first one. Johnny 5, as he is now called, has to learn about the world and how so many are just out for themselves. A guy tricks Johnny into breaking into a bank so he can rob it. Ben, of course, is just trying to make little #5 toys. But Johnny 5 finally gets the point and finds out the man is going to destroy him and just get Ben and his new partner out of the way. What will Johnny do about this development.

It's cheesy, sure. But it's fun cheesy.

The joy of the second movie is that it stays in line with the first one. They don't do a massive change to the look of the film or the characters so they two flow well together. Fisher Stevens and teh robot are the only two characters from teh first film, but they are the same characters in the second. Sometimes in squals you see a character totally rewritten to become a different person. It's annoying.

This sequal captures all of the fun of the first movie.

The only drawback--if you can call it that, is that it's a double-sided DVD which is not my favorite format--I prefer separate discs; but I've used both sides a couple of times now--showed them to my grandkids who are old enough to handle the material (I think it's PG-13), and they positively loved the movies.  A certain *other* movie came out which seems to have taken a LOT of material (most particularly the actual design of the robot) and produced a fairly well known motion picture much later--this one (Short Circuit) was made before all the computer generated hocus pocus--and still beats that one like a drum.

My other must-haves are Pretty Woman, Good Morning Vietnam, Coyote Ugly and yes, Bambi.  I have a few more that are important to me but these are the critical ones. While I realize this is strange list, especially for someone who is pushing 60, but hey, it is what it is.  For my adult handicapped sons, we always have others, but none so important to them as Coyote Ugly. Short Circuit and the Toy Stories.  Those are extremely loved by my youngest who also lives and breathes Sponge Bob Square Pants.... at age 28.  The oldest is 39 and loves them, as well. Of course, he loves Baywatch and anything with any skin, so he's not so reliable in his favorites.
But if you've never seen Short Circuit, regardless of age, I strongly suggest you at least rent it.  The humor is there for all ages.  Most go right above the younger teens or children's minds,, but we just can't watch it enough.  The acting superb, the special effects awesome, and the plot hysterically believable - especially to the younger set.  Check it out! Find it in the video category.  Preferably before they are all gone.  The first one was made in 1986, So they may not publish as many as a newer movie.

You won't regret it, I assure you!",1382745600,,1547,4.2534246575342465

4953568,3,B0064SVO9I,"These films were by no means masterpieces, but they were fun and pleasant, and this set was well worth the price.  All you get is one 2-sided disc, meaning the only label is near the center hole and almost needs a magnifying glass to read.  Mine was mislabeled (the side with Short Circuit 1 was labeled Short Circuit 2, and vice versa) but that's a minor problem.  I once bought a Cyndi Lauper 45 that was the same way.  The movies themselves were as cute and funny as I remembered.  Fisher Stevens (Early Edition) appears in both as Ben, the Indian scientist who carries on a hilarious, ongoing struggle with American slang.  Steve Guttenberg was miscast as Number 5's inventor in the first film; he just didn't seem to need to even be there, and he was not missed at all in the sequel.  In SC 2, Cynthia Gibb made a much more interesting female lead than Ally Sheedy did in the first.  And I'm sure a lot of viewers will be relieved that Number 5 (later called Johnny) didn't spend nearly as much time watching TV in SC 2.",1369699200,8,1025,4.3578947368421055
