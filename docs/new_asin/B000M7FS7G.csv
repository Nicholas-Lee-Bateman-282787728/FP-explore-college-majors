8166915,1,B000M7FS7G,"Cover of DVD deceiving. Cartoon pictured on cover is not on DVD. In fact, there are not any cartoons in that style. There is really not much on this DVD at all. Some faces and a figure in motion. Not worth buying. I would highly recommend the Activity TV Cartooning with Bruce Blitz DVDs. They are great!",1412380800,2,304,4.350877192982456
