As soon as I saw that they had finally released a DVD of their work, I knew I had to get a copy because it would be that good.  I have watched their early work, some of which is included in this set.

Rather than wander around listlessly getting into trouble because of lack of direction so often seen in groups of kids today, these young people have chosen to create art....movies, acting and writing adventures worthy of  adults many times their age.  The kicker here is that they have taken their 5 old (at the start) little brother and made a superhero out of him.

Budget for the movie.... Who needs a budget when you have this much talent?  I'll bet their parents are so proud that daddy Lund is about to pop the buttons off of his shirt.... Then again probably not........  I think he expects to see great things from these kids and that is part of why they excel.

Back in time a hundred years, homesteading like my grandparents did, this family shares togetherness and caring for each other that allows these young people to be successful where many modern families would fail.....to create rather than sit idly by while time marches on.

As you might guess, I am not unfamiliar with the work of Andrew Lund and family.  I am an administrator at [...] and have seen Andrew and his families work since he was around 17.  He came to our building forum sharing and instructing on alternative building. He spent a lot of time teaching us and others of their Cordwood Home building project.  Andrew was acting in the capacity of family general contractor, even at his young age, and most who did not know his background thought they were talking to someone many years older.

He went on to build a vertical log cabin, cordwood barn, and share as well as discuss methods with us on the forum about his projects

You will get glimpses of a few of their homestead projects in some of the short adventures as well as see them blow up good ol' dads truck a few times.

Fights..... unlike me and my siblings, these kids are just acting and a good job at that.  Jamb packed with knock `em down, beat `em up adventure it will hold your interest throughout the show and leave you wondering when you will be able to see more.

Inspiring first class entertainment and something I know the grand-kids as well as adults will enjoy many times over.
