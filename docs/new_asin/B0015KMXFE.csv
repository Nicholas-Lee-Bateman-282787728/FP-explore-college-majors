3145445,5,B0015KMXFE,I loved it!! Although I think that you have to be in the airline industry to really get some of the references...I think it is a good laugh for everyone. I LOVE PAM ANN!!!,1207612800,,171,4.0588235294117645
3145446,5,B0015KMXFE,Best comedy ever!!! Two thumbs up.  Pam Ann will make you laugh.  I recommend it to everyone especially if you are a flight attendant.,1206230400,,134,4.541666666666667
3145447,5,B0015KMXFE,"I bought this DVD a couple of weeks ago and I found it hilarious! I would only recommend it to those who fly somewhat often or are somehow involved in the airline industry. Otherwise, some of the jokes might not make sense. For example, if a viewer doesn't know that EasyJet is a large European LCC then he or she will miss out on a few great jokes.",1222992000,5,349,4.147058823529412
3145448,5,B0015KMXFE,"I love this lady.  I have seen her live twice and love this video.  You are able to pause and replay to catch all of her funny quotes and lines.

A MUST if you are in the airline industry!!",1221523200,,189,3.7948717948717947
3145449,5,B0015KMXFE,"She's the best. The DVD is har live show and some video material. The show is the best but it all worth the money, but then again I love her.",1221004800,,141,3.7333333333333334
3145450,5,B0015KMXFE,"This DVD is a must have for all flying material. No matter you are FAs, Pilots, Ground staff... whatsoever - you will love it and maybe find yourself in some of the scenes....

But take care if you are watching this with a friend who has absolutely nothing to do with the airline business - might be tough to follow. They will sit and stare schocked and maybe they never want to fly again ;-D

Hope I can see her live one day.

Have fun

3145451,5,B0015KMXFE,"Watched to it one night, laughed out loud repeatedly.  Watched it the next night with someone else and laughed out loud AGAIN.  Being a frequent traveler, especially to international locations, will help you get ALL the jokes, but you can certainly still enjoy it if you've only been on a plane occasionally.",1220572800,5,308,4.903846153846154
3145452,1,B0015KMXFE,My Sony DVD player could not figure out how to play this one.  I returned the first one and tried another.  Same thing.  I think there is a defective batch.,1219708800,,156,4.133333333333334
3145453,4,B0015KMXFE,"I first heard about Pam Ann on YouTube and thought the clips were all fantastic, and just recently I finally decided to buy the DVD. Very happy I did!! Caroline didn't fail to dissapoint on this one and what I really enjoyed about this one is that she actually talks like she knows what she's talking about relating to the aviation field, instead of  ""Airlines, hey? What's the deal with that?""  I'd say in order for you to get every joke, chances are you have to be an employee or at least a really big airline fan.",1215388800,,516,4.309278350515464
3145454,2,B0015KMXFE,"I could not stand this one myself, it seems like it's a show that the gay community will rave about, but I did not find anything funny about a women doing an entire comedy routine about airports and planes.

I guess if you like to hear a woman on stage constantly calling gay guys c-suckers, then this might be the thing for you. Quite frankly, I did not find it to be all that funny... it either needed to be dirtier, or funnier, but this chick prancing around the stage like she knows it all gets pretty boring after a while.

I couldn't bare to watch it anymore after the first half hour... it's more for fans of shows like Absolutely Fabulous and Queer Eye For The Straight Guys with that idiot Chef Ramsey guy thrown in as a woman.

Priscilla Queer of The desert fans will rave and rant about this, maybe a few women and men who have never seen one of the millions of comedians funnier then her, but personally, it just seemed to be the same joke stretched out and milked to death.

On the cover is says, ""Cruelly Funny"" - Maddona --- Like Madonna knows anything about comedy? ""You'll be rolling in the aisles"" - Daily Mirror... did they sponsor the show or something? ... ""a delicious comic creation"" - The Independent -- the who???... ""Hugely popular, witty, sexy and ridiculously rude""  ... yeah, hugely popular with the gay community, witty if you can stand 2 hours worth of airport jokes, sexy (huh) and ridiculously rude... what was rude about it? Ohh... the foul language... yeah, if your going to insult people, make it funny, not blurt out ""that gay guy sucks cauck"" and expect me to see it as ""witty"" and ""funny""

It gets a laugh cause no one expects a women to say it to a gay guy... but after she does it once, it loses its comedic value, and she milks it 100 more times... yeah, funny... it's hardly rude comedy... just, an idiot kind of comedy of a very untalented so called comedian with a huge ego problem.

And how dare other reviewers compare her to Mel Brooks, Monty Python, etc... shes not even in the same league.",1215302400,,2039,4.392572944297083
3145455,5,B0015KMXFE,WOW!  I SAW PAM AN ON AN ATLANTIS CRUISE IN 2006 AND INSTANTLY BECAME A FAN.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY TO GET HER WACKY AND UNBELIEVABLE HUMOR; YOU JUST NEED TO BE A FREQUENT FLYER TO LAUGH YOUR SOCKS OFF.

3145456,5,B0015KMXFE,"As a former Inflight Public Relations & Safety Specialist (Sky Hag, Air Hostess, Stewardess or Flight Attendant) I loved this DVD.  Pam Ann has managed to capture industry specific humor that the uninitiated will also enjoy.  It is naughty fun and as such perhaps not for everyone. (Oh but sitting with gin & tonic in hand watching this with flight crew friends is ""FABULOUS"" with jazz hands and extra swish!)",1207699200,,409,4.828571428571428

I laughed all through the entire video and could associate with it, since I have been a Flight Attendant with Pan Am for 33 years. Great entertainment and highly recommended.",1375574400,,193,4.705882352941177
8258879,4,B0015KMXFE,She's much better in person but still worth seeing this. Thats pretty much true of most things however... no? s,1360454400,,111,4.6

8258881,5,B0015KMXFE,Purchased this DVD with 2 day shipping as I was going to be traveling soon and wanted something to watch. The product came an entire day earlier! Practically 1 day shipping for the price of 2! Over-all this is one of the most hilarious and entertaining things I have watched in months! (Maybe years?!) Definitely worth it if you have any interest in travel. Highly recommended.,1312416000,,377,4.7272727272727275

8258883,5,B0015KMXFE,"Pam Ann is absolutely hysterical.  Extremely campy and relatively poignant at time, this stand-up airline-themed comedienne will have you rolling in the aisle.  If you have any knowledge of commercial airlines of the world, are a frequent traveler, or if you simply love a gay-ole time with flight attendants, Pam Ann is the Purser...I mean, comedienne for you. Fasten your seatbelt, put up your tray table, grab a drink, and press play.

Please be aware that this is definitely adult-themed.  Hysterical to watch alone, wonderful to watch with friends, I would NEVER watch this with my grandmother. :-)",1262131200,,603,5.122448979591836
8258884,1,B0015KMXFE,"....I'm so disappointed!  The tube was filled with raves about this show and I was very interested in seeing it.  The London daily papers gave the live show rave reviews, also.  Am totally disappointed.  The ""acting"" isn't good and she simply isn't funny.  I don't think this is because I'm not a frequent flyer...I have been in London, Austin, Chicago and more within the past year.  I don't think it's because I'm not gay, either!  Just isn't funny.",1232409600,,451,4.705128205128205
8258885,4,B0015KMXFE,"If you think of all those times you got on a plane and thought to yourself....Goodness, that flight attendant doesn't look like she wants to be here looking after me, well you are right...Pam Ann is absolutely hilarious!!!  Being a flight attendant myself I can totally relate to this comic performance.  Very talented comedian, hopefully they bring out more things from Pam Ann.",1227657600,4,379,5.0
