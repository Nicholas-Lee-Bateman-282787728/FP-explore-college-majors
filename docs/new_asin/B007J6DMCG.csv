8518220,5,B007J6DMCG,"I am one of those people who believe a picture is worth 1000 words.  After reading the book we got this DVD set to better understand what was going on and I'm glad we did.  The author demo's the concepts with different dogs which really helps understand the techniques.  It is especially helpful in that that the dogs you see are not already adept at performing the tasks.  We get to see the instructor shape behavior.  Just be aware that the material presented in this DVD set is advanced, and may be a little deep If you have just got your first dog and have never heard of clicker training.",1406419200,8,593,4.3545454545454545
8518221,1,B007J6DMCG,"Put on the first DVD.  Very amateurish video, but never mind that - it's a canine seminar after all (or advertised as one anyway).  Trouble is - nothing of any interest happens.  The instructor keeps talking, not necessarily anything that could be used as an insight or advice on how to proceed with dogs when trying to train them.  Complete waste of time, as far as I'm concerned.  Tried returning it, no such luck.  The selling company ""Canine Specialty Services"" quickly closed the deal and was unavailable for negotiations (Sure they would...).  Over $100 down the drain for me, could have bought some useful books on dog training instead.  Well, one of those sour lemon deals, it happens.  That's why I made a point of posting a review, which I seldom otherwise bother to do.",1403654400,4,780,4.718518518518518
8518222,5,B007J6DMCG,I like that it is a filmed seminar.  You get to see many different dogs with different issues and watch in real time as they are given training suggestions.  So many great tools.,1389571200,9,178,4.363636363636363
