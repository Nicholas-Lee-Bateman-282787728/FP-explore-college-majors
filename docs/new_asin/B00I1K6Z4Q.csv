6247062,5,B00I1K6Z4Q,"Like the other reviewer I'm really irritated that this movie is a hallmark show and was released outside the U.S., what a crock!  I'm pretty sure it would be well received here, it's a cute show.

6247063,5,B00I1K6Z4Q,"This movie needs to be released in the United States, no offense Amazon, as this doesn't pertain to your company & the the Great items & customer service/satisfaction your company provides to the masses, since when did Hallmark start releasing their movie productions to countries outside of the United States. Hallmark you're an American Company, please release the American made films to the people that support your company, and then release them to everyone else. Fix this and get it right Hallmark!!

The actress/actor have been in more recent Hallmark movies, but this movie is still their best, in my opinion. Their chemistry, the sweet storyline make for a splendid movie.

6247072,4,B00I1K6Z4Q,"The movie does not have chapter selection which is a huge disappointment since, when watching at home, I often have to watch in segments.

6247086,4,B00I1K6Z4Q,Why isn't it C.C Closed Captioning? Cover has the symbol Square Box enclosing CC But no CC!! I'm 91 years old and use hearing aids but need Closed Captioning to fully understand what they are talking about. I use TV Ears but could really use closed captioning. How can I determine before purchase if it truly has C.C. ? Does all Blue Ray disks have Closed Captioning??,1484956800,,368,4.507462686567164

8638217,5,B00I1K6Z4Q,"This is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  It is one of the better Hallmark movies with an actual story. Most of the newer movies are basically the same cut and paste plot with zero creativity.

The h has left three grooms at the altar. She is an interior designer and becomes a subject of a bet between the H and his friend. The H is the ultimate bachelor and avoids commitment. She does fall for the H but finds out about the bet.  She does not know that the H called off the bet once he knew he was falling for the h.

A good story, a great cast of characters including the H's poker buddies, and the chemistry between the two is hot.",1517184000,,640,4.096
