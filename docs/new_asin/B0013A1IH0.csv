3102659,5,B0013A1IH0,"While one reviewer preferred the 2nd disk, which shows less familiar social revolutions than India, Nashville and So. Africa, which are featured on the first disk, I have found this first disk extremely valuable for my college students.  Most of them have no living memory of the Civil Rights movement or the struggle against Apartheid, and they express great amazement in seeing the way the blacks were treated in the South, and how the So. Africans were treated under Apartheid. They also see the incredible power of strategic nonviolent struggle in a way that would be impossible to match verbally or with the written word.  Each of the 6 documentaries is beautifully done, and make it seem like we're an eyewitness to these struggles for freedom, all achieved without violence and war.  Most people today assume that violence and war are the only ways to deal with violence, but these films show clearly that actually the reverse is true.

Steve York does a great job with this documentary of 6 nonviolent struggles, as he has also done with The Orange Revolution and Bringing Down a Dictator.  I am very grateful that I have these films, by which to teach the current TV-video-Utube generation this powerful alternative to war and violence.

There is original footage, interviews, and some brief background information typical of documentaries. While slow-moving at a few points, I give it an excellent rating in terms of overall content: these are very important and hope-giving historical examples of the effectiveness of nonviolence. Highly recommended for the classroom as an introduction to the healing power of nonviolence.",1240704000,4,503,5.72
