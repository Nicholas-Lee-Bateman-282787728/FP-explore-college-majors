4718083,4,B005KP77GU,"Quick, witty, and a truly amusing satire. It really hits dating in Hollywood on the head. The film provides a simple message--get laid or get paid. Any guy out there who has ever tried to hit on a ""9"" or ""10"" in Hollywood will love this film. Its a simple ""how to"" guide on dating in LA/Hollywood.

Enjoy.",1321401600,,305,4.258620689655173
4718084,5,B005KP77GU,"Writer/director Paul Sapiano does it again in his new film, Hollywood Sex Wars. A follow up to his cult hit, The Boys and Girls Guide to Getting Down, Sapiano delivers a comedic punch that will appeal to Hollywood hipsters, small town suburbanites, and everyone in between!

Based on actual experiences, we follow Johnny Eyelash, a suave, sophisticated player - maybe the coolest dude in Hollywood. He leads a group of hapless guys looking for action, through the minefield of love and the trenches of sex and straight into the wars that go on every night in Hollywood. Ya' know the war...guys lookin' to score and chicks lookin' for more! Hollywood Sex Wars!

The guys' opposition is fierce,though! These sexy girls are no easy match for this rag tag group of new recruits. Big Wendy, Little Wendy, and the rest of the ladies' crew have gotten together to form their own sort of trade union, so that together they can use their sexuality to combat the guerrilla tactics that Johnny Eyelash and his protgs have unleashed against them.

What ensues becomes a battle of keen wits, small bits and big t*ts.

Do yourself a favor and watch it now. You'll be glad you did.

And hey, there are tons of hot chicks in this movie! What more could you want?!?!?!",1321401600,,1251,4.69406392694064

4718086,4,B005KP77GU,"Hollywood Sex Wars is nothing like Boys and Girls Guide to Getting down. There is an evolution in the style of the writing; the story is a lot tighter, though the subject matter covered is very similar. Paul Sapiano offers the usual serving of sex, drugs and cynicism, but this time with a twist: the perfect LA happy ending (outdone only by Kim Kardashians multimillion dollar-making wedding and her soon to be even more lucrative divorce). Anyone familiar with Sapiano's work can see this writer/director likes to stick with talent that has proved itself, and you can tell that Dominique Purdy (who also starred in Boys and Girls Guide) is a young actor that is going to go places.

It was hilarious to see gay icon Mario Diaz playing no-nonsense womanizer Johnny Eyelash, I think that's a little detail that a lot of people who are not familiar with some of the players in this film will miss that adds a whole dimension of funny to the movie. Christine Nguyen is brilliant as a chattering bratty club girl, and it's a shame her part wasn't bigger. Eli Jane's comedic timing cannot be overstated, either -- the scene where she demands that her boyfriend buy her a house that results in a fight where she threatens to call the police and accuse him of abusing her would be as horrifying as it sounds were it not for her ability to convey the absurdity of her position through her facial expressions and actions.",1320364800,3,1413,4.629482071713148
4718087,5,B005KP77GU,"There is something about living in Los Angeles that makes you want to shred it into a million pieces. I can't count the number of apocalyptic films I've seen recently that took turns completely tearing it apart. This isn't an endtimes flick, but it can't resist the urge of taking aim at the city. The result is absolutely hilarious.

Anyone who doesn't think the characters have sufficient depth to be believable has never been to Los Angeles. The scene where the guy chops up a Barbie to illustrate what LA girls are under the cute clothes, shoes, implants, makeup and hair is iconic, and so is the scene where the girls are doing yoga in high heels and talking about how men are just like dogs. While thousands of kids are out protesting the role corporations have come to play in our lives, there is a whole culture of people who neither know nor care about current events.

Fortunately for all of us, these people are too busy hooking up to ever vote.",1320278400,,956,4.520231213872832
4718088,3,B005KP77GU,"HOLLYWOOD SEX WARS will most likely appeal to those who love the Hangover/Bridesmaids/Knocked Up /etc movies. It is outrageously written and directed by out-there Paul Sapiano, and deals with sparing a group of nerdy guys under the tutelage of Johnny Eyelash (Mario Diaz, best known for 'Adam and Steve', 'Killer Drag Queens on Dope', etc) - Dominique Purdy, Richard Blair, Nicholas Cooper - who learn how to be players, against a group of women who have banded together by Big Wendy (Jenae Alt) and Little Wendy (Eli Jane) to learn how to get what they want form men without the clutter of a relationship.

Basically this film is a parody on the far edges of men and women in the dating spectrum.  Sapiano manages to expose and take a long look at dating and drugs, big city life, plastic surgery, fetishes, all with the accompaniment of a lot of exposed huge mammary glands and naughty talk. If that sort of thing entertains then this is one film that is sure to please.  it is high class, big budget sleaze (if there is such a thing).  Buyer beware!

4718089,5,B005KP77GU,"...I think it's great! Although I might be a bit biased seeing as how I helped work on the movie...but it really is a smart, funny film that I would definetly recommend to others. HSW takes a hard hitting approach to empty headed starlets, gold diggers and the men that take them home. You know, Hollywood types. But truely, it is a fun, light hearted film; full of laughter, sex, drugs and promiscuity. Leave you children with grandma for this one and enjoy!",1321920000,,459,4.542168674698795
4718090,5,B005KP77GU,"This movie was hilarious. It does a great job making fun of the sexes in the ""Hollywood scene."" I was literally out the other night in LA and was reminded of this film. It's visually attractive to the eye, and has some sexy cute characters (who are funny). All around FUN to watch if you want to just kick it and laugh (not think too hard), it's a good choice.",1321660800,,360,4.1571428571428575
4718091,4,B005KP77GU,"i was surprised that a movie in this genre could be this clever and witty while still walking that edgy sexy line.

lots of funny moments, and actually a lot of gems of dating knowledge swirl around in this raunchy ride.

enjoyed it on several different levels!",1321574400,2,261,4.531914893617022
4718092,5,B005KP77GU,"I enjoyed this film more that I thought I would. the shooting of it was great , keep U on the edge of what happens next. It is a great film for Swing parties or to get a sexy party going, for sure recommend to my sexy friends. I like some of the acting, but that charactor actor that played the producer and got his hair riped out, he was very good & believeable. The Girls are very Hot, part of the appell of the film.

Playboy mansion babes planning world domination while lounging at the poolside listening to elektro new wave music (cool Arling & Cameron soundtrack)... 3 hipster slackers getting pick-up lessons from the Cassanova neighbour... It's funny and witty and intelligent but also trashy and, at times, misogynic. In a word: a slice of (Hollywood) life in 2011.",1321488000,,424,5.343283582089552
4718095,5,B005KP77GU,"I loved this movie, mostly because of it's hilarious perspective from both genders. Anyone who lives around Hollywood can't possibly go without laughing, and even if you don't, trust me, it's just as good!!",1321401600,,206,5.088235294117647

8477073,2,B005KP77GU,"Most of the girls have beautiful, sexy bodies. That's the only good thing about this movie.
The jokes are not funny. The acting is acceptable. I don't care about the plot because I'm sure this type of films does not have it.",1377043200,,224,4.357142857142857
8477074,1,B005KP77GU,"For a start the title is misleading as there are no Hollywood, no sex and no wars. Most chicks plainly plain with acting abilities well below zero. What this flick reflect perfectly is general confusion about life in US--nobody work but has money, how everybody pays bills is mystery, prostitution is illegal and has negative image so chicks are trying to do their best to look...ehehe hard to say from the movie. What everybody does is drugs, drinking and havinng good time and in addition chicks trying to extort money from guys.  Family values left in 19th century etc. You get the idea. Yes, couple times we see tits. Should I continue?",1343779200,,640,4.714285714285714
8477075,2,B005KP77GU,"This is a silly sex romp about relationships. The hot chicks in town go from beyond having their own clique to communicating about their dates through a web site. This looked like a fairly funny idea, however it was underutilized. Three guys are attempting to get laid by hot chicks, but fail to do so. They come under the tutoring  of Johnny Eyelash (Mario Diaz) who knows all their secrets.

The back and forth war was poorly developed as were the characters were never got to know. The film equates dating to prostitution. It had some cute ideas, such as the women meeting at a heart shaped table and using a high heel as a gavel, but that was about as funny as things got. Most of the time the production had predictable plot and old jokes that didn't work. Better off watching a Julie Strain film, such as ""Delta Delta Die."" If you are a fan of the ""American Pie"" series (and I am not) you might enjoy this type of humor.

F-bomb, sex, nudity (Shyla Stylez, Suzy Kaye, Christine Nguyen plus many more) 2 stars is generous.",1340409600,2,1027,4.423280423280423
8477076,4,B005KP77GU,"I thought this movie was just another of those cheesy movies with just a bunch of big boobs and no story what so ever, but it's not that exactly. There are a ton of big boobs, but it actually has a pretty good story to it. The story is the main reason why it was better than expect.

The story is about, how average guys can get hot girls. But, the story also goes further by having a group of girls that has made a mission to finding guys that can give them what they want and spend all their money on them for sex, and guys that cannot do this end up on a blacklist. Then, this other group of guys want to be able to get these hot girls and have a leader name Johnny to show them how to do this. Both groups learn about each other at the end and it kind of all works out at the end.",1335916800,,784,3.8098159509202456
