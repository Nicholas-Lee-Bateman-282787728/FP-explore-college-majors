2718198,5,B000M2E3F4,"This is the kind of movie that makes fun of the worst possible tragedies that could happen to you... and in the same Day. made me laugh during the whole movie and I watch it over and over again, the best thing about this movie is the slang spanish used, but english subtitles will make you laugh just as much.",1208217600,2,309,4.166666666666667
2718199,5,B000M2E3F4,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matando-Cabos/dp/B000M2E3F4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matando Cabos</a>&nbsp;is a foreign film and comedy in the Spanish language where you shake your head from side to side and think ""Oh my God!  This movie is just plain WRONG!""  Full of hyperboles, this situational irony is a great representative of a new generation of Mexican cinema and U.S. foreign film and is the ironic twist on what happens when a son who adores his father, and on his father's behalf, seeks retribution from his father's former friend turned tyrannic employer.  Followed by a case of mistaken identity, a fantastic adventure ensues as a result.  Watch and witness as director Alejandro Lozano brings life to many literary techniques without so much as a hint.

A very dark comedy, this foreign film is not only hysterically funny, it is almost a parody that is full of action and will have you on the edge of your seat.  And the ending...  an epiphany!  Mexican cihema has definitely taken on a new direction with Matando Cabos, a must see for all native Spanish speakers and lovers of foreign film, mexican cinema, and anyone who appreciates dark comedy!",1186963200,8,1203,5.361702127659575
2718200,5,B000M2E3F4,"This opera prima from director Alejandro Lozano is one of the bright spots of New Mexican cinema in recent years.  The whole corruption theme was beginning to get old by 2004 (witness Conejo en La Luna) and Matando Cabos treads new and very interesting ground as a less melodramatic and more darkly ironic and comic film.  The title is a play on words, as Atando Cabos means ""tying up loose ends"", while adding the M makes it ""killing Mr. Cabos"" (Pedro Armendariz).

The performances are all outstanding: Armendariz as the mafioso businessman, British immigrant Jaqueline Voltaire as his wife,  Ana Claudia Talancon (here just two years after her breakout in El Crimen del Padre Amaro) looking as fresh as ever, and border baby Tony Dalton (Jaque) and Polish-Mexican Kristof R. (Mudo) in the lead performances are fun and believable.  Raul Mendez is good but I liked him even better in 2006's Kilometro 31 (no DVD release yet).  Silverio Palacios is also quite interesting as Tony ""El Canibal"", but the most incredible of all was certainly Joaquin Cosio as Ruben aka Mascarita.  His performance is so fascinating he really takes over the film.  The film says his character is from Huichapan, Hidalgo, which I think might be real as the first time I ever saw him was in a bit part in the Hidalgo-filmed La Habitacion Azul (curiously not credited on IMDB).

The really great thing about Matando Cabos is the script; the events are so far fetched yet plausible they have you saying ""oh no"" time and again as you see the inevitable unfolding.  I also love the way they made two of the most embarrassing aspects of Mexican popular culture (banda music and lucha libre) seem fun and interesting.  I can't stop singing ""Reina de Polanco"" each time after I view the film.

The DVD has English and Spanish subtitles and plays on region 1 players.  The only problem with this disc is that they released it in full screen.  If you can understand Spanish, I would therefore reccomend you get the Mexican import version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matando-Cabos-Killing-Cabos-2-Disc-Special-Collectors-Edition-NTSC-REGION-1-4-Import-Latin-America/dp/B000LORD0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matando Cabos (Killing Cabos) 2 Disc Special Collectors Edition [NTSC/REGION 1 & 4.

2718201,5,B000M2E3F4,"This is the perfect movie for those that love wacky narratives, confusion, and a touch of absurdity.  It's really funny.  And really good.  And really violent. I can't tell from the description here if it is available with subtitles for an English speaking audience.  I hope so, since it is one of my favorite movies and I am wanting to share it with some English speaking friends.",1169164800,3,381,4.641791044776119

8165728,1,B000M2E3F4,"my apologies to all those that loved it. But, from my end, wretched to the lowest extent. If you like horrible, violent and stupid movies with angry guys viciously beating the crap out of guys who can't defend themselves, a movie devoid of any redeeming quality whatsoever, then get this without delay!",1439337600,,302,4.826923076923077

8165731,5,B000M2E3F4,well the movie is in Spanish. is really funny but is for a more mature audience. i would definitely recommend it to people that like Mexican movies. really great cast by the way.,1349827200,,178,4.424242424242424

8165733,5,B000M2E3F4,"If you like comedies with memorable characters like ""Snatch"", you'll enjoy Matando Cabos.  While it's not as brilliant as a Coen Brothers black comedy, it's still a totally entertaining movie.

Alejandro Lozano effectively takes a page from Quentin Tarantino's playbook by throwing in plenty of funny dialogue that's completely unrelated to the plot itself.  I caught Mexico's MTV Movie Awards in 2006, and remember this film winning ""Favorite movie"", ""Favorite Actor"", and even the ""Most Bizarre Sex Scene.""

If you like violent black comedies with plenty of interesting characters, flashbacks and fantasy sequences, by all means add this Mexican film to your collection.",1270425600,3,672,5.495145631067961

8165736,5,B000M2E3F4,"Who would've thought Mexicans made movies, let alone great movies like this! Matanndo Cabos is a laugh-riot dark comedy. The plot resolves around an extortion/revenge plot gone wrong. The greatest part of all though is the car chase between the Audi and classic American car (I think it was a Plymouth). I had the great luck to see this movie in theaters, and was very happy to see it come out on DVD. Don't worry about the subtitles, you need to learn some Spanish anyways if you want McDonalds to get your order right.",1234396800,,520,4.542553191489362
