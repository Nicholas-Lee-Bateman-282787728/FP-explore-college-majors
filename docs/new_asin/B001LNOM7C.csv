A lone rider, Tom Crenshaw, is on the road to Santa Fe. He sees an ambush and tries to stop it. The victim gives him a small wallet to deliver to Molly. The bushwhacker had a written note on him. In town some men play a practical joke on two men. Tom meets One-shot Morgan and offers a shooting match. This is a trick! Tom outsmarts One-shot. The Circle J ranch needs hands. Who is trying to put the Circle J out of business? Molly Bates is the daughter of the owner, who arranged a bank loan to save his ranch. [But he was ambushed and shot.] Tom is the new foreman of this spread. The Sheriff is there to arrest Tom on suspicion of murder. Bates wallet was found under his mattress in the bunkhouse! Now its empty. [This tells you who the bad guy is.] But Tom disarms the Sheriff but fails to escape! The cook Bridget says Tom is a good man. The Sheriff is advised to take Tom to the county seat tonight.

A mob invades the jail. Four men ride up to take Tom away. They take him to Stanton, the gang leader, who will protect him (a case of mistaken identity because of that note taken from the killer of Dad Bates). A man robs Stanton of the $5,000 he took of Dad Bates money. He talked like a Mexican. Tom delivers the cash to Molly. The next day Tom visits Molly and tells her Stanton is behind her troubles, but he needs to find the man who initial is D. Stanton arrives to offer help to Molly, and asks her to marry him. Molly wants time to think it over. Stanton has a visitor, Denton, who hired Tex French and exposes Tom Crenshaw as an imposter. Tom escapes, the gang pursues him but he eludes them. Tom tells Molly about this. They need to get the good citizens to form a Vigilante Committee as Stanton controls the town.

Stantons gang arrives, can they hide Tom? The gang rides away. Stanton sends a man back to watch the Bates place. Bridget catches this man and drives him away! He tells Stanton where Tom is, so they ride back. Bridget fires a shotgun to drive them away! Tom rides away so Molly is free to go to town. Can Tom escape by jumping over a gap in a mountain? [Was this trick photography?] Tom and Molly visit Tibbett to bring about a showdown. They use the telephone to contact the good men in town. Stanton is warned about Crenshaw, Tibbett and the others. They arrive and shooting begins. Tom enters the house for a fistfight with Stanton and Denton. They will be turned over to the law. Will Tom stop drifting and settle down? When he finds what he wants.

This has a complicated story that makes an interesting movie. It seems like scenes were edited to reduce the running time to an hour. The story remains interesting until the end (but you know the good guys will win at the end). Toms activities remain strenuous.",1506297600,,2775,4.269961977186312
8319145,4,B001LNOM7C,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""SANTA FE BOUND""  (15 August 1936) (58 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Tom Tyler was an American actor in silent and sound motion pictures --- He was born Vincent Markowski, into a Polish-American family --- Tyler had a long career in film, stretching from the 1920s to the 1950s, and appeared in many films, most of them westerns such as John Ford's ""Stagecoach"" and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" --- He occasionally took ""civilian"" roles in feature films (he's the boxing referee in Abbott and Costello's ""Buck Privates""), but the biggest part of Tyler's screen career was spent making low-budget B-movie westerns for modest salaries --- Most of his budget westerns were made by Reliable Pictures for producers Bernard B. Ray and Harry S. Webb --- Larger studios cast the athletic Tyler in rugged roles --- In 1940, he was the Mummy ""Kharis"" in ""The Mummy's Hand"" --- In the first film adaptation of a comic-strip superhero, Tyler had the title role in the 1941 film serial ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"", and starred as one of The Three Mesquiteers in Republic's series of western features.

In 1943, he starred in ""The Phantom"", based on Lee Falk's famous comic strip --- Tyler personified the role, looking especially striking in the character's familiar costume, and much of the serial's great success was due to Tyler himself. It was Tom Tyler's last major screen role --- One of my favorite serials is ""The Phantom of the West"" (1930), was billed as the ""all talking serial"" which is still available through Amazon or VCI Entertainment, great action plus harding riding and fighting scenes with Tom Tyler in the middle and riding in and out of danger.

There is little doubt that Tyler was a shy man most of his life, but he was also a man of inner confidence, willing to take on huge risks within his own abilities over and over again --- Tyler had a tremendous work ethic and enjoyed working hard for what he believed in --- from the weight room to learning his craft in acting --- Tom was a major ""B-Western"" cowboy star and while simultaneously working as a western hero, he was also a weight-lifting champion --- Tyler was once considered the strongest man in America, he won the national AAU weight-lifting championship in 1928 (he lifted 760 lbs.) and made the 1928 U.S. Olympic team.

Tyler was beset by rheumatoid arthritis in the later part of his career, and was limited to occasional supporting roles. Nearly destitute, he returned to live with his sister in the Detroit area, dying there of heart failure at the age of 50 in 1954 -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)
