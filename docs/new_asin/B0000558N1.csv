1393681,5,B0000558N1,"This is one weird and wicked movie about 70's teens wondering through a post apocalyptic world. VCI has announced a 1.85:1 widescreen anamorphic transfer that will blow previous releases away. The disc is rumored to have an interview with Jim McBride (the director) and a few other extras. If you like ""A Boy and His Dog"" you will love this film.",1235952000,,346,4.688524590163935
1393682,5,B0000558N1,"Glen and Randa doesn't ""end on a hopeless note"" at all!  But I won't spoil the ending for you.  This is a movie about discovery and learning, with all of 1970's current society removed and only people left - except for one crazy cat with a motorcycle and tech toys.  Sort of a hippie paradise, except for the radioactivity.  If you have any interest in great High Concept sci-fi no matter what the budget, this is a must see.",1187481600,,425,4.341772151898734
1393683,4,B0000558N1,"Before Jim McBride became a famous producer/director, he made the ultra low budget ""Glen and Randa"" in 1970. Long considered a mini-sci'fi masterpiece by film cultists everywhere, G&R tells the slight story of two naive teens wandering a doomed landscape like a new Adam and Eve-- looking for the magical city of Metropolis.
The futileness of their quest is brought home in that we (the audience) know from the outset-- there is no such place. This makes the movie's touching conclusion all the more sad.
Shot for about a dollar ""Glen and Randa"" none-the-less, delivers its message of humanity's last gasp with aplomb and gravity.
This film deserves a comprehensive DVD release.",1110240000,9,678,5.0625
1393684,4,B0000558N1,"This is a post-apocalypic film in which a young man, accompained by his pregnant girl friend, search for the city of Metropolis, which he had seen in a comic book he found.
I originally saw it in its theatrical release, when it was X-rated due to sex and nudity (the film begins with the couple making love in a car body stuck in a tree).  It's pretty mild by today's standards.
I was impressed at the time with the scenes of people searching through a ruined Howard Johnson's for canned goods.  However, the quality of the video makes the characteristic orange roof muddy and unrecognizable.  I also like the couple's meeting with an old man, who hadn't spoken to anyone years, and has difficulty remembering how to talk.  It's little touches like that that are part of its charm.
But although it's the same film, the quality of the transfer to video (at least the copy I have) is poor.  One brief scene also repeats in the video, a little disconcerting.  It's too bad, because it's really is a fine film, thoughtful and touching.  It was made by the Seattle Film Collective, and shot on location in the Pacific Northwest.
Should you buy it?  Sure, if only to see it once.  See if you can get copies of Brian DePalma's Greetings! and Hi Mom! too.  Then you can have a real 60's retro movie party.",1051833600,7,1297,4.480851063829787
1393685,4,B0000558N1,"I'll keep it short.  This film follows two teenagers through their attempts to cope in a world strewn with the debris of a collapsed civilisation (ours).

I was browsing the Video store years ago and ran into this and actually rented it several times over time. The dialog is a bit off, but the film did manage to reamin in context with coping after a nuclear holocaust. probably a bit dated, but was stil a good watch.",1474416000,,363,4.126760563380282

7931005,3,B0000558N1,"Remember back in the 1970's post apocolyptoc movies were on the major motion picture studios list so they were low budget, minor league studios produced.",1382572800,,153,5.16
7931006,4,B0000558N1,"I had been wanting to get a copy of this movie for 30 years, and finally found one.  I really wasn't expecting much, being a Jim McBride movie.  After all, he made the AWFUL remake of the classic French New Wave movie ""Breathless"" which is nearly unforgivable!  However, this earlier effort is really not that bad, as long as it is not taken at ""face value.""  Remember, this movie was made in 1971, so, when watching it, you have to keep that in mind.  Free love and flower children were prevalent, the Vietnam War was in full-swing, and the world was coming out of the utopian 50s.

Both nude and living in the forest, Glen and Randa are two teenage flower-child-like offspring.  A nuclear war had happened some 35 years before, and little is left of humanity.  In a small commune that they join comes a capitalist nut on a motorcycle who wants gold, silver, and jewels (like there is any use for it).  He is like some crazed snake oil salesman, and slimy.  Glen becomes obsessed with wanting to go find his utopia, The City (wherever that may be), and goes on a quest to find it, with the reluctant and pregnant Randa following (with the aid of a horse that they never ride).  They come upon the ocean and an old man, who has not seen a soul since his female friend died 20 years before.  Her skeleton still remains in a totally dilapidated doublewide on the side of the cliff on the ocean.  They begin living and behaving like an old 50s nuclear family, not really understanding what they are doing.  Randa gives birth.... the rest I will not spoil.

From the beginning, I found the movie to be extremely daring.  First, it is an outright allegory of Adam and Eve, complete with a car in the tree (read: apple), where sex occurs.  The salesman can be seen as Satan, even seducing Randa.  I will not go further in the allegorical reading, only to note how the clothes both wear become more and more layered as the need for more material goods rises!

Second, the movie is a criticism of consumerism, mostly that of the post-WWII generation and 50s society.  In one scene, Glen is told by the old man at the ocean that people watched the television in the trailer.  He does so, but there is no electricity, but he has an unlit pipe in his mouth and magazine.  Glen goes around painting words (usually spelled incorrectly) on all the items in the home, and criticizes Randa for not helping him clean the house and making it orderly.  It's comical and tragic.  Randa is pregnant and really unable to understand the concept of being a mother, let alone a ""wife.""  Glen thinks only of himself and his quest, which is probably fruitless.  It is surreal watching the two ""play house.""

Third, the movie shows the naivety of the free-love, flower child types, who believe that reverting to ""Eden"" status is for society.  It's fascinating that in 1971, someone had the audacity to make a film that criticized this mentality outright!  The relationship between Glen and Randa is vulgar; they are simple children who don't understand the impacts of what they do.  They have sex without regards to its outcomes (pregnancy).  There is no drug use, but one sexual scene that is truly difficult to watch in this part of the film.

My problems with the movie are probably universal.  For a person who is literate, able to speak with little grammatical error, and able to convey himself somewhat well, Glen has no morals.  He relies more on Playboy, sex books, and comic books that anyone with reason.  The city he searches is Metropolis, ""where everybody flies.""  Also, these two had parents (I hope), but nothing was taught to them?  Maybe they died when either were young, but where did Glen learn to read?  Besides, Glen has a wonderful hair stylist!  Who repairs motorcycle engines 35 years after Armageddon?

I liked the idea that the ocean's edge was in Idaho.  Boise is the city nearby, and the entire West coast is gone.  However, this doesn't put into account the loss of the Cascades.  The ""playing house"" section is wonderful and tragic.  Some of the camera shots are really good, for such a low budget film.  The editing is interesting, using blackness between edits to show time passing.

Warning to the queasy: There are several horrific scenes of animals being butchered and killed.  The final 10 minutes are also not for the weak-hearted.  If you dislike full-frontal nudity on either men or women, beware.  The film begins that way.  There are 3 sex scenes.  None of these items bothered me at all, and simply reinforce my evaluation that the movie is a religious allegory and critique on the culture clashes of the time.  They are in the movie for a reason.

4 of 5, mostly because it is difficult to sit through, McBride remade ""Breathless,"" and there are many problems with the movie.  This is NOT for any young viewers.  Besides being bored, there are some difficult to watch scenes.

There are some extras on the disc, but nothing worth noting.  I had one glitch about 12 minutes from the end of the movie, but nothing as extreme as some of the other reviewers mentioned.",1355097600,2,5079,4.599777034559644

7931008,2,B0000558N1,"Glen and Randa is a 1970 film that was initially rated X for (gasp!) full frontal male nudity!  Don't want people to see that male genitalia do we?  Gosh no.

The film has a slight amateurish feel to it at times.  Sometimes the scenes end abruptly in a choppy fashion.  Some scenes linger on way too long.

Glen and Randa are a part of a group of holocaust survivors and decide to leave their group and wander on their own in search of one of the major cities in the US.  What they find isn't what they expected.

The acting isn't bad but leaves something to be desired.  It isn't polished.  At times I was completely absorbed in the story and at other times it almost felt like a bad sketch from Love American Style.  It's very uneven!

Watch it but be warned this is not top knotch film making here.",1300665600,,801,4.231788079470198
7931009,4,B0000558N1,"Here's a quietly beautiful artifact from the end of the 1960s, one with a message that's still all too timely. Glen & Randa are two naive, blissfully ignorant young inhabitants of a post-apocalyptic America, wandering on a quest for a wonderful city we already know doesn't exist. The story is told in a series of blackouts, some holding only a single image for a moment. This minimalist approach not only suits the mood of the film, it makes what we're seeing almost documentary-like.

If you're looking for Mad Max-style violence & action, you won't find it here. Rather than offer adolescent power fantasies, the film offers a more convincing & chilling view of the post-apocalyptic world -- almost an emotional landscape, one that's been flattened & where all sense of meaning has been burned away in a searing instant. The survivors are all clearly traumatized, barely able to function; those born afterwards inherit only scraps of knowledge that tell them nothing.

And this is the message that comes through: just how fragile & thin the web of civilization really is, and how much we take it for granted. Glen & Randa are so terribly bewildered as they try & fail to understand things that seem glaringly obvious to us. Glen in particular has just enough dim awareness to realize that the knowledge he seeks is out of his grasp, that he can never really piece together a meaningful world. Yet he keeps on trying ... because what else can he do, after all?

I know this film has often been dismissed as self-indulgent hippie meandering. Certainly it's not the sort of thing that will immediately appeal to an audience raised on fast edits, quick cuts, and CGI. But give it a chance, fall into its slower & more contemplative rhythms, and you may find yourself strangely moved, much to your own surprise. More than that, it might make you think about the technology & culture you take for granted, assuming it'll always be there for you ...

Note: yes, the DVD has a problem with its third chapter locking up, so be warned. My five stars are for the film itself. Here's hoping VCI will correct this flaw in a newer DVD.",1256947200,3,2124,4.701612903225806

With his curiosity piqued, he and pregnant Randa embark on a journey to find it --- This film moves at a slow pace but is very captivating --- Keep you guessing what is going to happen next --- One of the most powerful aspects of this film is the fact that there are no characters who provide a sense of sanity and strength --- all of the older characters seem to have been driven into a sort of semi-schizophrenic absent-mindedness by whatever it was that took away their old civilization --- As our two main characters seem unaware of the inherent dangers of their travels that you seriously worry about their safety as they tramp barefooted through the mountains and across deserts --- this is a quiet, thoughtful film if you're looking for something unusual, you've came to the right place.

7931011,1,B0000558N1,"Avoid this DVD at all costs, for surely your money will be wasted. I bought this movie to feed my recent post apocalyptic binge, and though I found the movie to be strangely satisfying (I am not a huge Independent Buff) the quality of this DVD is terrible, and believe me when I tell you, my standards are not high. Aspect Ratio is 1.85:1/16x9 Anamorphic.

 First off, the third chapter is unreadable. I don't know if this is a fault in the DVD I got or if all of them here are that way. Every other chapter is fine. Second, the sound is so bad you have to crank up the volume to where you hear a hum from the TV speakers during silent moments in the movie. I thought the picture quality was alright. People will still be unhappy with it though. The DVD comes with a lengthy interview with the director, Jim McBride, who had only confirmed my suspicions about him when he admitted that yes, he was a hippie in 1970 and yes, he was stoned when he directed this movie.

 The movie itself received an X rating when it was originally released in 1970 for its shots of frontal nudity. It begins with Glen and Randa completely naked in the forest. Glen often finds himself wondering how humans lived before everybody was reduced to squalors scavenging the ruins of a dead civilization for food, until one day a traveling merchant pays a visit to their little community showing off all these weird mechanics and gizmos that no one there understands (a blender, [...], a record player). What happens next, I don't know since the DVD was too faulty and I had to skip to the next Chapter but Glen gets it in his head to leave the settlement and make a journey to Metropolis, a city where everyone is dressed in white and can soar through the air...

Randa does not want to go, but knowing she cannot survive without him, she reluctantly follows Glen to this mystical place. The journey there is long and challenging, and with a baby on the way, Randa becomes deeply concerned since food is so scarce in the wild, but Glen keeps raving about glittering lights, cars that go, Playboy, Miss January, The Rolling Stones and a bunch of other nonsense that Randa simply has never heard of and does not understand.

 If you are looking for leather-clad warriors with shotguns held together by duck tape like in Madmax, you will need to steer clear of this film. Glen and Randa tries to depict a more realistic future of humanity. Instead of fighting gangs and tribes, Glen and Randa battle hunger. Instead of collecting oil, they collect firewood, cloth, and rope as they fight their way to the mythical city.

 Unfortunately, VCI Entertainment is not trustworthy. The first DVD they put out for this movie is total crap.

 A Boy and His Dog is a better movie. My opinion. I would have given this movie 3 stars if it were not for all the problems I had with the DVD. Threads is the best Post Apocalyptic Movie ever. Americans need to seriously discover that one.",1241136000,8,2945,4.485981308411215
