7997995,5,B0000B1A2E,"Fans of Robert DeNiro can double their viewing pleasure with this pair of films which are some of DeNiro's greatest. In MEET THE PARENTS,released in 2000 and on video in 2001,DeNiro is Jack Byrnes,a CIA worker whose daughter(Teri Polo) is the love interest of Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker(Ben Stiller). Greg after meeting the Fockers,ends up making trouble. Jack finds a marijuana pipe in Greg's posession. Also the Fockers' roof is accidentally set afire by burning fallen leaves. Greg,taking a cigarette break atop the roof flicked his butt inside the leaf-filled gutter. The Fockers' backyard was beautifully decorated and prepared for the wedding of another daughter of the Fockers. Greg finally received his luggage that the airline he traveled with lost. Worst of all,the family cat Jinx ran away,frightened by the fire. Greg spray-painted another black cat's tail to make it look just like Jinx. Greg,about to fly home,is evicted from the airplane after verbally abusing a flight attendant and mentioning the word ""bomb"". Greg was arrested and taken to jail for the disorderly conduct as well,bailed out by Jack. In 1988's MIDNIGHT RUN,DeNiro is Jack Walsh,a bounty hunter about to be paid 25 grand for bringing Jonathan Mardukas(Charles Grodin),an accountant who embezzled mobsters to the Los Angeles County Jail. Also after Jonathan is FBI agent Alonzo Moseley(Yaphet Kotto) and Jimmy Serrano(Dennis Farina),the leader of the embezzled mob. In one scene,Jack steals Alonzo's FBI badge,impersonating him. Joe Pantoliano is Eddie Moscone,the owner and operator of Moscone Bail Bonds who pays Jack to bring Jonathan to L.A.(Eddie bailed Jonathan out,not realizing who he was at the time). Jack and Jonathan travel through various parts of America,starting in New York where Jonathan was arrested by Jack. They end up in Texas,Arizona,Nevada and finally in California. Another bounty hunter named Marvin Doerfler(John Ashton) is sent to get Jonathan also. Eddie phoned Marvin at a Pittsburgh motel where Marvin was staying. Marvin found Jack and Jonathan in various places(on a train,in Texas,Arizona and Nevada where he was arrested by the FBI). Jimmy is given computer discs in place of Jonathan(the discs has the mob's account records on them). After Jack and Jonathan arrive in L.A.,Jonathan is let go. MIDNIGHT RUN is a sophomore joint project for Ashton and director Martin Brest. Ashton was Sgt. John Taggart in BEVERLY HILLS COP,one of Brest's earlier films. Jay Roach directed MEET THE PARENTS. Both films were distibuted by Universal Pictures. DeNiro made a few other films for Universal,those including the 1991 remake of CAPE FEAR with Nick Nolte and BACKDRAFT,released the same year.",1087776000,4,2694,5.356132075471698
