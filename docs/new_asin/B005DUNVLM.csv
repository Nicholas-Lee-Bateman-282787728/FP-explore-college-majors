8467613,5,B005DUNVLM,"Even though this story received very low ratings when it premiered in Denmark, it is still a very decent story. Jakob Cedergren's character Thomas Schaeffer features heavily in this episode and we also get another chance to see Iben Dorner (Sanne - Borgen - Series 1) playing his estranged wife Bendicte. Co-stars Laura Bach and Lars Mikkelsen seems to take a lesser role in this story in which Schaeffer infiltrates the underworld.
Is Schaeffer's son safe? Has he fallen into the hands of an underworld boss (Kim Bodnia - The Killing - Series 1 / The Bridge.
The ratings for this episode were probably the deciding factor in TV2's decision to cancel any future series in Denmark even though the show had sold well overseas.
Also guest starring is Thomas Levine (TV1 host Ulrick Mrch - Borgen) briefly.
I liked this story and it is certainly not the worst of the series.",1332806400,,870,4.730263157894737
