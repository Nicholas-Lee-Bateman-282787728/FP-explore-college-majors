1603673,5,B00005JO7P,"If you like the Office, BBC or NBC, and you have any knowledge of LDS culture, than you will enjoy this movie. The mocumentary follows the boys as they try and create a ""boy band"" in Provo, Utah while singing ""hip"" songs about different LDS idiosyncrasies.  The song's include: Everclean, Word Of Wizzum, Love Me, But Don't Show Me, Diddly Wack Mack Mormon Daddy, Wait For Me, Spiritchal As Me, Sweet Spirit (a ballad), Nourish And Strengthen Our Bodies & Do Us The Good That We Need, Dang, Fetch, Oh, My Heck and Beautiful Inside. If you know something about LDS culture, just the song titles are enough to induce giggling.  The titles do not do the lyrics and the performances justice.  There were several fall out of your chair moments.  If you have a funny bone, this movie is worth the investment.",1198454400,3,802,4.5874125874125875
1603674,5,B00005JO7P,"Actually, I got this movie along with three others together on eBay. At first I thought it was a promo for an actual band so when I watched it I was very disappointed because I thought the band was so lame...well in reality that is what it was intended to be. But I think there is a great message here about pride, ego, control, submissiveness, being overly accepting of others, falling into trends that reinforce exploitation, and so on. Although it is a spoof on certain aspects of LDS life, it does nothing to demean the Church itself. I think instead it sends a message to those who take Utah Mormon life so seriously that they avoid their own identity and are fearful to be themselves--which goes for the members of the band. The only two persons who stand out who are themselves is the first manager who had it all wrong and built expertise out of mediocrity, and the second manager who had it all right but was too timid to express herself until the end, which worked out great.

Being a West Coast Mormon, it is a bit different than some hardcore Provo type where 97% or so of the community is LDS. That is not to say that I or they believe any differently, but it is to say that they take their lives often to be the center of the universe and get in return a very myopic view of life as it exists in the rest of the world, and in fact they often tend to reject it or put down those who exist outside of their community. That is simply how it is, and it is understandable. I think this movie attacks that, at times, insipid viewpoint but where it falls short is that it does not connect with others in the Church who actually are what they see as being missing in the Provo/Utah culture.

It took me maybe three times watching it before I felt I finally got what the movie is about and it is now one of my favorites. I like Kirby Heyborne and I think the roles he plays permits the other characters to blow it such that it illuminates misplaced emotions and notions of what is right and wrong in a social as well as personal context. The message in this movie is very clear, and that is if you conceptualize yourself in vague ways that identify with a blurry concept of self, others, organization or whatever you are going to move very slowly through life and you will be spending most of your time self-justifying. It shows that personal identity is clarified through the acceptance of others who may lessen your control but broaden your perception of others in ways that permit kindness and understanding to displace ego, bias, and ignorance.",1185580800,3,2553,4.383966244725738
1603675,5,B00005JO7P,"Sons of Provo is a hilarious and cleverly written spoof of the Mormon kind.  3 straight-laced guys form a boy band (""Everclean"") and try to hit the big time...with the ""fly moves"" their 70 year-old dance teacher ""got on the streets"" and their hot songs spoofing their wholesome lifestyle.  You're going to love this movie, whether you're LDS or not, but being LDS does help the viewer to catch some of the inside jokes.
Done in a documentary style, stars Kirby Heyborne and Will Swenson are so believable in their ""interviews""--I can't even think of anything else to say besides ""you've got to get this movie"".  There's one part, where Kirby loses a very important item and he honest to goodness cries-tears dripping--Kirby Heyborne is incredibly funny and likable.
So, so funny.  Great soundtrack.  Get the movie to see if this is one boy band that can stick together...'cause I'm not telling!",1182038400,6,894,4.855263157894737
1603676,4,B00005JO7P,"The songs are remarkably good. We have the soundtrack and get as much, if not more, out of it than I did out of the movie. The songs are so amazingly funny once you are able to catch all of the lyrics. They move so fast that it is only after playing it a number of times that you catch all of the tongue-in-cheek and satirical jibes at mormon pop culture.

After realizing how good the songs actually are, I found a new understanding for what they were trying to do with the rest of the movie, which provided some extra humor in places that I didn't see it at first glance. Honestly, at first run I was only mildly amused by this movie, but I'm getting to like it better after listening to the soundtrack.",1169856000,,705,4.1838235294117645
1603677,1,B00005JO7P,"Son's of Provo just isn't funny; its humor falls flat.  But worse, it's difficult to like a movie which spends all of its time doing elementary-school mockery. I love spoof, good satire, and poking fun -- this film doesn't rise to any of that.  It's just punk stuff.  It seems Will Swenson thinks he's funny in the movie, but to me he is like watching a third grade kid trying to get attention on the playground.",1151452800,2,412,4.394736842105263
1603678,2,B00005JO7P,"I'm glad I got this from the library. If I would have paid a rental fee for this I would have been annoyed and if it would have plopped down $20 bucks to buy it I would be kicking myself.

The movie is not awful, it is easily watchable and moderately entertaining for about thirty minutes or so but by the time it is finished you will be thankful.

Most of the jokes fall flat and I don't think there is any part of the movie where you will laugh out loud; there are a few moderate chuckles but nothing more. Plus they regergetate some of the jokes over and over again, if I hear one more time ""I would like to turn the time over to Brother...."" that joke was moderately funy the first time.... by the 10th time it is not.

Anyway, the film is much better and lot more enjoyable to watch than the horrible Hometeachers and the even worse Baptists at our Barbeque but not nearly as good as Singles Ward and RM.

It might just be that the Mormon joke scene is getting a little old!",1143072000,4,979,4.109947643979058
1603679,5,B00005JO7P,"""Sons of Provo"" is a fantastic satire of a Mormon boy band that is hilarious, fresh, and innovative. Most of all, the talent is incredible, and writer, director, producer, actor and singer Will Swenson, who has looks and charisma as well, is obviously headed for big-time stardom. Filmed on a shoe-sting budget, they make the most of every dollar, with excellent sound and editing, and inventive costuming and sets. The film starts as 2 brothers audition for a 3rd singer for their band, and we watch it grow from rehearsing in mom's garage, through their early days of horrendous gigs, to popularity.

Will Swenson plays the control freak ""leader,"" and Danny Tarasevich his brother, who adds a little Buddhism to his Christianity, along with some Prozac. Kirby Heyborne (who was so good in the wonderful ""Saints and Soldiers"" as Flight Sergeant Winley) is the new addition to the group, and is a sensitive soul who likes to scrapbook. All 3 are terrific singers and actors, and the songs are inventive and fun in their absurdity. One of the best scenes is when Will reads a review that rips their show apart with acerbic sarcasm, as if it was complimentary, and it is a side-splitter.

Others in the cast that shine are Jennifer Erekson as their manager, Peter Brown (who also co-wrote and produced) as their first inept manager, the marvelous Maureen Eastwood as their choreographer, and the a cappella group Moose Butter makes a cameo appearance. The DVD has many extras, and the commentaries by Will, Peter, Danny and Kirby are informative and amusing. Don't miss Kirby's ""beat box"" in the ""Deleted Scenes."" If you enjoy mockumentaries, you'll love ""Sons of Provo."" Total running time is 93 minutes.",1133136000,16,1703,4.909722222222222
1603759,1,B00005JO7P,"Being LDS myself, I suppose I should cut the ""Mormon movie"" subgenre of film a little slack.  These movies are almost always made independently, relying on local talent and sparse budgets to tell their stories, and they do their best to stay clean and family-appropriate most of the time.  However, I'm of the firm opinion that a movie can still be good despite lacking a blockbuster budget or big-name talent.  And Mormon cinema HAS produced some wonderful films, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-Two-Years/dp/B0043UWW1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best Two Years</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/17-Miracles/dp/B005ETQ2RM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">17 Miracles</a>.  Which is why it frustrates me so much when Mormon filmmakers keep turning out stinkers -- films with terrible acting, badly written scripts, and jokes that are either inaccessible to a non-Mormon audience or are just plain not funny.  Lack of a budget is no excuse for not trying, people.

""Sons of Provo"" is the absolute nadir of Mormon cinema -- and manages to go beyond the impossible and be inaccessible to LDS audiences as well as non-LDS.  It's essentially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Is-Spinal-Tap/dp/B002CMXAYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Is Spinal Tap</a>&nbsp;but with an LDS boy band... and unless you're both familiar with Mormon (specifically Utah Mormon) culture and have seen and ""gotten"" the aforementioned ""Spinal Tap,"" this movie will only confuse and infuriate you.

""Sons of Provo"" follows the fictional boy band Everclean, and plays out like a documentary -- following two brothers as they seek a replacement band member, struggle to find a venue to perform their music, and butt heads and egos over the smallest things.  Will is the self-proclaimed band leader, arrogant and taking credit for the band's every success while running roughshod over the other two band members.  Danny is a Mormon with ""Buddhist tendencies,"" a Prozac addiction, and anger management issues, and who makes a halfhearted attempt to play peacemaker when Will's ego gets out of hand.  And newcomer Kirby (an unfunny running joke is that everyone constantly gets his name wrong) starts out excited and enthusiastic to contribute, but grows increasingly more bitter and frustrated when it becomes obvious that he's the underdog of the band and constantly ignored and belittled by the other two.  The film follows their rise to ""fame,"" from their humble beginnings as wedding singers to their increasing popularity to their inevitable falling-out.

Like with many LDS ""comedies,"" the production values of this movie are pretty much zero.  The acting is either over-the-top hammy or pretty much nonexistent, as if the filmmakers just recruited random people off the street to play in the film.  The entire movie has the feel of having been shot with a home video camera, and makes little effort to make smooth transitions between scenes.  And if the filmmakers were shooting for a ""mockumentary"" feeling, they missed the target -- while there are frequent ""interviews"" with band members and the people involved in helping the band work (the agent, the choreographer, the band members' parents and former teachers, etc.), the rest of the film completely lacks the documentary feeling.

Being about a fictional band, the film features plenty of music... but most of it is pretty bad.  The music itself is all right, I guess, if you like the '90s boy-band sound (Backstreet Boys, N*SYNC, 98 Degrees, etc.).  The lyrics are abominable, though -- bizarre lyrics, weird rhymes, and subject matters that will go right over your head if you're not familiar with Mormon culture.  The exception is the final song,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beautiful-Inside/dp/B002GOVSI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beautiful Inside</a>, a guitar number that's actually quite lovely and touching.  Thankfully it's possible to purchase this song separately, instead of having to purchase an entire album of this dreck.

My biggest problem with this movie is that it's JUST NOT FUNNY.  Maybe there's some larger joke here that I'm not getting, but most of the jokes will escape you entirely if you're not intimately familiar with Mormon and/or Utah culture.  I don't mind a handful of inside jokes in a film, but when that's all a film relies on, it brings it down in my eyes.  The jokes that are aimed at a more general audience aren't amusing either -- they're more ridiculous or eye-rolling than anything.  Maybe there are people who think such weirdness as a deaf choir teacher, a band manager lugging a trombone into the desert, or using Cocoa-Cola to treat a Prozac overdose hilarious, but they prompted little more than a raised eyebrow from me.

There were exactly three moments in this film that brought a smile of enjoyment to my face -- a cameo by Utah-based acapella band Moose Butter (best known for their ""Star Wars"" video that went viral several years back), the aforementioned ""Beautiful Inside"" song, and a disclaimer in the credits:  ""Everyone in this movie is based on people the filmmakers knew in real life, so if you know the filmmakers at all you're probably somewhere in this movie.  So sue us.""  When a movie's funniest moment is hidden in the closing credits, you know something went wrong along the way.

If you want a good Mormon movie, watch ""The Best Two Years.""  If you want a funny music-based movie, watch ""This Is Spinal Tap"" or ""School of Rock.""  Avoid this film unless you have absolutely nothing better to do and need to kill a couple of hours.",1374019200,,5736,5.489192263936292

1603761,5,B00005JO7P,"This movie makes me laugh over and over again. It has lots of mormon inside jokes, so I'm not sure how it would go over to someone unfamiliar with the community. But honestly the reason I watch it is to hear the music. It's like Gilbert and Sullivan where the plot is stupid but the music is terrific.",1363046400,,301,4.206896551724138

1603764,3,B00005JO7P,"I gave this glorious turd three stars for the shot-on-the-cheap, but the idea, the attempt, that deserves the full five stars.  If you're like me, a desert rat transplant outsider scraping along here in Iran, U.S.A., this deliciously, gloriously, LOUSY fun turkey is full of belly laughs; it thoroughly and with malicious glee lampoons all of the feudal local command society that is Utah.  It was such a stunning success shot on such little money (amateur, I mean really, really cheap looking, instant direct-to-video BAD film making) that it was banned at the local theaters here in Utah's Vatican City by one of the business powers-that-be who owned the chain.  A must, MUST viewing for anyone who wants to ""get"" Utah and enjoys some great tongue-in-cheek groovy bubblegum pop songs.  Really, the evident quality between the film (amateur, shot on the lam) and soundtrack (very, very well done) is night and day.  Buy both, and if you can get the SONS OF PROVO CONFIDENTIAL DVD (I ran all over town here in Salt Lick City and bought every copy, something like 10 of them, at the Temple Grounds' LDS BOOKSTORE at 90% off, to pass them around among my BAD music through-the-mails friends as some great jokes), buy it, too, though the running time on ...CONFIDENTIAL is a little skimpy.

If you like this, THE Mormon THIS IS SPINAL TAP, I suggest running down Richard Dutcher's work (especially BRIGHAM CITY!), and that awful remake, the Nick Cage turkey, THE WICKER MAN, which is about Utah--beehives, the angry, grumpy, controlling women, and emasculated men who serve them.  Better yet, take a trip to Salt Lake during one of the multi-level marketing conventions and watch DAY OF THE DEAD performed live in the streets and on the TRAX lightrail when the Salt Palace lets out.

Update, 8/16/2012:  Will Swenson appears on ""There Ain't Nothin' Like a Dame"" on Dee Snider's album, DEE DOES BROADWAY.  (Dee Snider:  recall Twisted Sister?)  Kirby Heyborne appears as Teddy, Sofia Vergara's ""husband"" character, in the 2012 movie, THE THREE STOOGES.  The guys are moving up in the arts!

1603765,4,B00005JO7P,"This is my kids' favorite movie to watch on Sunday evenings. You probably wouldn't catch most of the humor if you aren't LDS or don't live in Utah, but Mormons should all get a good laugh from it.

My only complaint is there is one song full of ""potty words"". The song is titled ""Dang, Fetch, Oh my Heck"" and starts out with the lyrics, ""Dang! Fetch! Oh my Heck! What the holy scrud? / H-E double hockey sticks! That's frickin' flippin' crud!"" It is supposed to be funny. . . and wouldn't be a problem for most people, but my four-year old repeats it over and over again.",1309132800,3,571,4.238532110091743
1603766,4,B00005JO7P,This is a pretty good mockumentary following the hit Mormon boy band Everclean.  The awkward/funny moments abound in this glimpse into the shallow world of the members of this boy band.  For fans of Kirby Heyborn and Will Swenson this is probably a must-see.  The original songs are quite listenable with witty lyrics.,1304899200,,318,4.962264150943396
1603767,5,B00005JO7P,"This movie is hilarious. I'm from California, but lived in Provo while at BYU, so maybe spending time there, and being a Mormon, I am able to 'get' more of the jokes than someone without those experiences...I could see how somebody (my neighbor and my mom to name couple) would just watch it with a blank stare though. This definitely caters to a specific audience. You also need to 'get' the kind of humor in shows like ""The Office""...if you like that show, and you're LDS or familiar with Mormon culture (especially the Utah valley sub-culture), then you'll laugh at least a few times watching this.

I definitely fit into the audience the writers had in mind. I laugh longer and louder each time I watch it!",1289692800,2,710,4.590551181102362
1603768,5,B00005JO7P,"If you're LDS and you ""get"" Rob Reiner's 1983 film ""This Is Spinal Tap"" (admittedly a small subset of the general populace), you'll absolutely love this movie; if not, well, your mileage may vary.  It has the same sort of irony, clueless characters, and hilariously inane music--it even has a character named ""N. Tufnel, Jr.""--but minus all the f-bombs (unless, of course, you count ""flip,"" ""fetch,"" and ""frick"").  All three of the principal actors add something special to the film: Will Swenson is the best comic, playing the ""Christopher Guest"" role; Danny Tarasevich is the best singer and dancer; and Kirby Heybourne is the best pure actor, contributing his usual sympathetic, boy-next-door quality.  The film manages to poke fun at just about every Mormon cliche and stereotype imaginable, but in a way that shouldn't leave non-Mormons mystified, and the music, well--it's brilliant and ultimately makes the film the entertaining piece that it is.",1201305600,4,953,5.215686274509804

7942425,5,B00005JO7P,"This is a bit dated maybe, the ""boy band"" phenomenon having waned some in recent years, but I grew up in a Mormon family in Salt Lake City and these guys have nailed that paradigm to a tee.  My thorough enjoyment of the premise, writing and execution may have a lot to do with that and some of what I find hilarious might go right past someone not from around those parts.  Still, there's a lot of ""band humor"" that anyone who's ever tried to be in a band or who got a kick out of ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Still Crazy""  or ""Electric Apricot: The Quest For Festeroo"" should appreciate.  ""Band dynamics"" are essentially family dynamics taken to an ever more absurd level, band members being essentially family members who *could* leave, but for inscrutable reasons do not.  Sons of Provo is saturated with comic band and family dynamics.

The DVD version is also one of those rare films where the commentary is practically a stand-alone movie on its own.  Definitely worth watching.  There is also a ""commentary on the commentary,"" a third track in which the cast and crew comment on their comments on the film.  I've never made it through the commentary on the commentary, but the concept, itself a commentary on the ridiculous self indulgence of the commentary track on most DVDs, makes me chuckle every time I think about it.

This may be a niche movie, but I think there are a lot of folks who would find it eminently entertaining.",1403222400,,1431,4.5546875
