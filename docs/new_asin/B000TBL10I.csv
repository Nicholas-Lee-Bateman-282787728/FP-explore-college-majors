8208514,5,B000TBL10I,"I ordered this DVD with low expectations. It's been over 50 years since the Superman radio dramas started, I was expecting very low audio quality and very fractured archives.

What I received was crystal clear audio quality, very logically named episode listings and simple mp3 formats stored on DVD. There are dozens of episodes of the program available, easily saved from the DVD to music organizing software or just to a folder on the desktop and 100% mp3 player compatible.
No DRM to deal with, no stupid menus, just a list of mp3s of perfectly preserved classic radio.",1209427200,,573,4.846938775510204
8208515,3,B000TBL10I,"I was looking forward to listening to the Golden Years of the OTR (Old Time Radio) broadcasts of Superman. But unfortunetly there are so many missing Broadcasts that the experience was incomplete. 26 Episodes are incomplete and 61 Episodes are missing. These were for the period of 12 Feb 1940 through 04 Feb 1949.

In addition Eight broadcasts were duplicated:

1360 46-09-11 George Latimer, Crooked Political Boss
1364 46-09-17 George Latimer, Crooked Political Boss
1375 46-10-02 The Dead Voice
1377 46-10-04 The Dead Voice
1378 46-10-07 The Dead Voice
1379 46-10-08 The Dead Voice
1380 46-10-09 The Dead Voice
1381 46-10-10 The Dead Voice

Furthermore for the period of 07 Feb 1949 through 01 Mar 1951 out of 151 Broadcasts 115 are missing.

These figures were taken from Steve Younis' Supermans Home Page (www dot supermanhomepage dot com).

Do I recommend buying this DVD

YES

The procession of these golden classics will give an insight of an era in our history that for some hold very dear memories. But be aware that there are some gaping holes within this collection, and the experience will be incomplete.",1200700800,4,1119,4.957219251336898
