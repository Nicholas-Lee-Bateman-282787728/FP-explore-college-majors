8520156,5,B000ZM4JUU,"A good introduction for the ADCC for someone who may be on the fence. This disc features matches from the actual tournament, as well as a couple of trial matches, which does result in a bit of a difference in visual and audio quality. However, the action is fantastic. Some brutal submissions, and the Garcia/Rodriguez match is one of the best you'll see.",1396137600,,355,4.650793650793651
