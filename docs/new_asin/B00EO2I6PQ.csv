5929628,3,B00EO2I6PQ,"I get its a very careful reconstruction of a geek event in the late 70s.  I get the motif of a baby picture of the PC industry, and also the references to Jobs and Gates.  But the pacing is very slow, and the film often feels like its building to something that never arrives.  (Although this may be intentional - perhaps the promise of technology is always promising too quickly?) Clearly a very well made film, but not my cup of tea",1385078400,3,434,4.2682926829268295
5929629,2,B00EO2I6PQ,"Amazon has this under the documentary category, but it is misplaced.  I had hoped to see Claude Shannon and other computing masters back when computer chess was budding.  This is an attempt an an artsy film that just doesn't pique my interest.  The attempts at humor come up short and the story isn't compelling.  Maybe in a different mood (like after a joint) I'd have liked this.  For an artsy film, I suppose it's pretty well done.",1384041600,3,434,4.584415584415584
5929630,5,B00EO2I6PQ,"This highly intellectual masterwork is reminiscent, unlikely as it may sound, of Apichatpong Weerasethakul's films: there's a naturalness, a quietness, a subtlety, and an underlying mysticism that's not directly addressed and yet (crucially) not ignored.  A bland Holiday Inn substitutes for Weerasethakul's exotic locales, but the enchantment is here in spades.  This film is a meditation on consciousness, inviting the viewer to distinguish between the players and the game pieces, between artificial intelligence and lucid awareness.  While the storyline is simple and covers a brief conference for computer chess programmers, all sorts of intrigues are present for careful viewers, some hinted at through mere flashes.  The depth of this film will easily go over the heads of the lazy, but rewards abound for anyone who enjoys stimulating entertainment.  I would disagree with other reviewers who praise the film's humor, only in the sense that there aren't formal jokes or slapstick but rather charming moments and whimsical surprises along the way.",1383523200,3,1054,5.5625

5929632,5,B00EO2I6PQ,"I saw this movie with my girlfriend at the screening in Tallahassee, just around the corner from Florida State University.  I'm a lifelong computer nerd and Computer Science student that appreciates quirky movies, dry humor, and whatnot.  I also grew up during an era of computers that came just after those depicted in this movie and so that aspect was very nostalgic for me.  My girlfriend, on the other hand, isn't a computer nerd at all.  So, I think the fact that we both found this movie very enjoyable and almost fell out of our chairs laughing at least once or twice makes for a pretty good vote of confidence.  I admit that this one isn't for everyone but I also think that a lot of people could really enjoy the movie.  It's very different but I found that quite refreshing and I think that others will as well.

I think that out of everything which I enjoyed about the movie, it was the characters that really took it home for me.  They're all so different and each have their own little back story which makes for interesting interactions among the characters.  I think that these back stories were developed well enough so that some of the characters really had a good sense of depth.  But at the same time, this movie wasn't always about depth.  A lot of it was very situational; you get to enjoy watching how the characters interact or get involved in some pretty awkward situations.

So, give it a chance.  I think that you could come away very happy that you gave this somewhat ""artsy"" or ""indy"" film a chance.  I know I did.",1381622400,11,1542,4.480286738351254
5929633,5,B00EO2I6PQ,"Loved it. This movie is in the best tradition of literature: it defies paraphrasing. I could describe the plot, but the movie isn't about its plot - it's about being immersed in a place and time of wholesome (or not), delectable, geekiness.

You could instead watch yet another Hollywood blockbuster with a car chase or two, a helicopter or fighter jet or aliens, and a square-jawed hero who saves and ultimately beds the girl. Or you could sample something completely different, a celebration of the intellect that simultaneously gives the emotions a tug or three. And maybe there's even a hero. And a girl.",1381622400,5,608,4.846153846153846
5929634,5,B00EO2I6PQ,"I went to see 'Computer Chess' at a theatre in Los Angeles and noticed that the filmmaker, Andrew Bujalski, was standing in the theatre's lobby, near me. I spoke w/ him briefly to tell him I was a fan of his previous films, and then he put the microphone he was using to speak before the screening to my mouth, telling me I could say whatever I wanted to, which made both of us chuckle. He smiled and shook my hand and told me he was happy I was at the screening, and then I watched the film.
It seems hard to review a movie that comes from such an intelligent, brave filmmaker. I think this movie is better than me. I felt entertained and pleasantly challenged by 'Computer Chess' throughout. The dialogue feels at once extremely realistic and 'trippy' in a powerful, totally unique way. Most scenes made me genuinely laugh b/c of the 'awkward' characters, or rendered me silent w/ awe b/c of a moment that I felt was visually stunning-- the b&w and vid camera make for, i feel, consistently stimulating visuals-- or philosophically profound. This movie felt like a masterpiece to me in the way that listening to 'OK Computer' felt like a masterpiece to me when I first heard it towards the end of 5th grade. I hope I have been successful in persuading you to watch this movie.",1381536000,8,1278,4.465811965811966
5929635,4,B00EO2I6PQ,"Computer Chess is one of those movies you leave thinking about for a bit afterwards.  There are several parts which, to me at least, are somewhat puzzling in a good way as if there's deeper meanings.  Meaning as in whatever you make of it, a style I personally love most of all in a movie experience.

The humor is quite dry and awkward, so it won't appeal to everybody, but ""everybody"" humor is stale and dumb;  although I don't deny their funniness, I think I've had enough Sunny in Philadelphia or Family Guy-type obnoxious comedy.  The performances are pretty good in a plain sort of way, as in they are acted realistically to the uber-nerdiness of the characters.  Some of them feel like their just playing themselves, and they're all very lovable.  Well written dialogue and direction for the actors, who pulled off quite the feat with Computer Chess' home-video feel; the movie gives a very nice documentary realism to me not only in the performances, but also the cinematography.

As an amateur B/W film photographer, I really appreciate the B/W use in Computer Chess;  I absolutely adore the old-school video, which is how they shot most of the movie--a major experimental part of the film.  Funny, usually experimental is synonymous with being new--avante garde--yet, for Computer Chess it is simply harkening back to long forgotten technology. Even the era of the movie also lends itself to the smart use of B/W and the movie's believability as a documentary.  When there isn't B/W, or the footage quality shifts to higher resolution, cues me for a major sign of hidden meaning to theorize and decipher--another cool part of using old digital filming technique.  Personally, I love visual hints in the photography of films rather than being written out before me through obvious dialogue.  There are also of course other times in the movie where the editing gives a clue about having to pay closer attention and even re-watch to figure out an abstract statement of the overall story.

So, there we are, pretty much all I had to say about a good movie.  Thoroughly enjoyed the acting, comedy and visual style from the B/W usage and home-video recording as well as a bit of trippy editing, too.

Oh! By the way...

...Wiley Wiggins.

Enough said.",1381536000,6,2255,4.828125
5929636,2,B00EO2I6PQ,"If you make the mistake of renting this film, you will most likely think, ""I'm halfway through this movie.  Should I turn it off and find something better to do -- like say, washing the dishes or staring at the wall -- or should I watch the rest of it since I paid for a full rental?""  So the movie puts you into Zugzwang from the opening move, which is never a good position for a chess player or a film viewer to be in.

I played high school chess, and have a degree in computer science, and so you'd think that this movie would have been as satisfying as a cheapo checkmate for me.  And you'd be wrong.  It was a blunder making the film, it was a bigger blunder paying for it, and it was finally the biggest blunder of all by not just resigning in the second act and dropping the King.  Or at least the remote.

I guess that this is supposed to be a comedy, and that may be so, but aren't comedies supposed to be funny?  While watching, I quickly thought that it was probably the filmmakers' intent to create somewhat of a ""Spinal Tap"" for nerds or chess players.  If this is true, it seems that all they did was offer us a poisoned pawn.  At least my stomach feels that way at this point.  And maybe even my wallet.

And I've seen many chess films:  ""Searching for Bobby Fischer,"" ""Bobby Fischer Against the World"" featuring Bobby Fischer, and ""Game Over"" featuring Garry Kasparov, to name but a few.  Those first two were really good, and even ""Game Over"" had its moments, even though Mr. Kasparov made some very unsound and invalid remarks during the film, surprising since he has such a high IQ.  But this film decided to take a quirky approach, and that quirkiness doesn't really work.  No; it doesn't work at all.  I find that even the worst episode of ""The Big Bang Theory"" is funnier that this stuff.

The professional reviews on this film seemed to be really strong, and so I was really looking forward to ""Computer Chess.""  Instead, all that I can think about now is, ""What move was my worst?  Was it taking a peek at the reviews, or was it picking up the remote?""  Argh.",1380758400,8,2084,4.292307692307692
5929637,1,B00EO2I6PQ,You have to have some serious patience on order to get into a movie like this. You couldn't have found a more uninteresting way to to bring about computers 'playing chess'.,1436572800,,172,4.580645161290323
5929638,3,B00EO2I6PQ,"Close to being kick-ass, but lost me about 2/3 of the way through. Good premise, good execution, but lacked any real character development, and the plot kinda trailed off at the end... like this sentence...",1427328000,,206,4.914285714285715
5929639,5,B00EO2I6PQ,"What a bizarre, hilarious little movie.  As a chess player and software developer, it was easy for me to get into the strange little world that the movie team created.  However, you don't have to understand chess or computers to enjoy this movie... a computer chess tournament is just the unusual setting they chose for the cast of colorful characters to carve out their little side plots.

This is a movie that shows itself through its details and dialogue so you have to pay attention to what's going on.  Although it has a somewhat straightforward story line it's a little hard to follow because of the weird zig-zags it takes between the characters.  But it's absolutely hilarious!  I laughed out loud many times at all the dry, subtle humor peppered throughout.  Michael Papageorge and the tournament director are two very memorable characters.

Other reviewers seem to think this movie attempts to be high-minded, which is silly.  It doesn't have anything to say about computers or chess.  It's just a weird little comedy that's certainly not for everyone, and it's impossible to tell if it's for you until you sit down and watch it.  In my opinion it's worth the gambit, just give it a shot!",1420934400,,1198,4.795121951219512
5929640,1,B00EO2I6PQ,"I like this film less and less the more I think about it. The few good features vanish from memory and I am left thinking much more of all the bad features.

The film really does not concern chess at all. Chess is not discussed by anyone beyond platitude. Don't expect to learn anything in depth about chess from the film. Or about what real life chess players or computer programmers are like.

After thinking for some time about the film I came to the conclusion that it's creators have no real interest either in chess or in advances in computer technology. At worst they are used as little more than plot devices, at best, as vague fuzzy ideas. Bad philosophy in a bad film.

The film does not ""mockument"" a computer chess tournament. I don't think more than 10 minutes of the film time is spent on the actual tournament.

If you play chess seriously you will probably notice many blaring violations of verisimilitude. Chess players do not make conversation as they (or their computers) play a serious game.  The errors that the computer programs make are unlikely to be ones an actual computer program would make, even in the early 1980's.

The portrayal of chess players and computer programmers is cliche; socially awkward, eccentric, maladjusted. Utterly nothing of real substance although the actors themselves cannot be much faulted.

Many characters are inconsistent.  The female chess player is not given any personality, she is simply ""the female at the chess tournament.""

It makes no sense that the guy has the intelligence to create a strong computer program, but then does not know how to act intelligently after failing to reserve a room at the hotel.

One of the main characters has an insight that the computer really wanted to play humans, not other computers. This is a completely ridiculous idea that no one involved in computing would give serious thought too. The female chess player has a similar ""insight"" that in reality is utterly moronic.

The problems go on and on. There are also plot holes that are evident once you stop and think about the film.

The ending is incredibly stupid and is entirely inconsistent with the earlier parts of the film, philosophically and structurally.",1415750400,,2211,4.835543766578249
5929641,4,B00EO2I6PQ,"Yes, another indie.  Copyright 2013 and no rating, so it never showed in general theatres.  The director tries to re-create (in grainy black and white, though color filming REALLY DID EXIST in the 1970s) the look and feel of early attempts at artificial intelligence, via annual competitions for who had written the best computer chess software.  The programs played games against each other until the final winner played a game against a human grandmaster.
Commentary by one of the Deep Blue programmers, Murray Campbell, and a short special feature showing four actual computer vs. computer games at increasing levels of program sophistication, are perhaps more interesting than the film itself.  As the 70s moved into the 80s a debate was going on as to the most successful way for a computer to beat a human expert: brute strength [take advantage of a computers exceedingly fast processing power to examine EVERY POSSIBLE MOVE, for as many turns out as the computer could handle] vs. a more sophisticated approach, that tried to some degree, to replicate the way humans play: look for the more promising moves, and explore those ones out further than you can go by examining ridiculous moves.  Campbell says brute force basically won out, as computers got faster and faster, memory capacity larger and larger, and then May 11, 1997 Deep Blue beat the world master Gary Kasparov, in two matches.  Since then, no human grandmaster has been able to beat the best computer programs [sigh].  Campbell observes astutely: in the early years every programmer was faced with his computer making a move that looked embarrassingly bad.  Now, when the machine makes a move that nobody would anticipate, its because its THAT GOOD.  Coming next: Terminator, Rise of the Machines, mwhahaha.  Oh: I give the movie a B-, and the extras are quite good.",1408147200,,1838,4.99672131147541

If anyone would like this movie, it would be me. I love chess, played lots of computer chess, am a programmer, and was a college student in 1980, the time this movie is set. The fictional B&W footage of early computer matches is boring. The sub-plots are boring and embarrassing. I have no idea what kind of person would like this movie, or who the target audience was supposed to be. The director was born in 1977, so had no experience of the time, and probably knows nothing about chess computers.",1407024000,2,515,4.548387096774194
5929643,4,B00EO2I6PQ,"This low key mockumentary is so dry in its humor that its more likely to produce a nostalgic or rueful smile than a belly laugh.  Set at a 1980s man vs. computer chess competition, and shot on what looks like a video camera from the time, it certainly succeeds in capturing a time, place and atmosphere.

On the other hand, some of it starts to get a bit repetitive and meandering.  Unlike Christopher Guests hysterical mockumentaries, this is so close to real for much of its length that it started to wear down a bit.  And then when it switches to a more over-the-top tone, as when one of the young leads is hit on by a pair of middle-aged swingers, it suddenly feels like a scene from another film.

None-the-less, this is an impressive accomplishment, using its lack of budget as a plus to create the feel of a truly home made documentary of the time.  It may not be brilliant, but its sweet, inventive, and fun, which puts it well ahead of most of whats out there.",1406764800,,969,4.385474860335195

5929646,4,B00EO2I6PQ,"""Computer Chess"" (2013 release; 92 min.) brings the (fictional) story of a computer chess convention from the early 1980s (it looks like 1983). As the movie opens, we are introduced to the topic of the day, very much documentary-style, and then we get to know the various characters that are part of the (small) computer chess community. There is the guy who has no hotel room. There is the only woman who is participating in the tournament, etc. etc. As the movie moves along, we understand each of their backgrounds a little better, and we wonder how the actual tournament will play out. To tell you more of the 'plot' would spoil your viewing experience, you'll have to see for yourself how it unfolds.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from actor-writer-director Andrew Bujalski (""Mutual Appreciation"", ""Funny Ha Ha""), who seems to become more and more skilled at making these little movies with virtually no budget to speak of. Second, this movie is shot in black and white, but more importantly, the way we get to see this, is as if we were watching public access TV from back in the day. Third, when the movie started, I was sure that I was watching a documentary. In fact I did a double-take of the DVD jacket to re-check whether this was fact or fiction. Last but not least, yes there is a movie 'plot', but far more important are the observations of the people and their environments within they exist: what exactly is ""artificial intelligence""? is chess the same as war? etc.

Bottom line: there is indie (like the Weinsteins), and then there is indie-indie, and that is where this movie resorts under. If you are in the mood for something way off-center, you might want to check out ""Computer Chess"", a quirky but interesting 'faux documentary' about the pioneer days of computer chess and computing.",1401926400,,1824,4.732704402515723
5929647,5,B00EO2I6PQ,"Computer Chess is an interesting attempt to capture the feelings of an other era(the 80s) through a simpler technology(Sony ATC-3260 tube camera).It's a paradox, because computer chess was about developing computer software programmes to take on human beings in games of chess. This film depicts a conference held in a hotel where different programmers meet in an annual tournament to find a winner. At the same time in the hotel there is a bizarre cult of seekers into sexual and spiritual awakening, using group awareness exercises. We are going back to the simpler forms of computer technology,when programmers instilled their intelligence levels up into a computing chess programme. It's the early form of artificial intelligence. The fact that it's in black and white is because of the technical limitation of video but it strangely enhances the beauty of effect,with dull/shallow focus,grey palette and the blooms and smears of light. Necessity the mother of invention. The documentary format the best way into this world,a homage to it. We also get the clunky machinery involved.

These nerd-voyagers are on the frontiers of new mental worlds. Their awkwardness showing their indifference to human reality,as the machines become more human,showing traits of consciousness and moods. Chess is really a Maguffin,since you do not actually see any games carried out in detail. Instead the film shows the point when human intelligence merges with computation,the eccentric frontier and its border guards,geniuses,weirdos,geeks of all persuasions,dope-freaks,conspiracy theorists,mavericks,folkies. There are times in the film that it seems a Magritte painting is coming to life,like where programmers become chess pieces,or hotel corridors look like something out of Last Year in Marienbad,the invasion of  fluffy cats,and the strange robot woman in the lobby.

Peter Bishton(Reister) forms the film's central focus,reserved,introverted,awkward,floundering from one situation to the next,unable to express his anxieties,discomforts. His eye the still logical centre of the apocalyptic changes. The attempt of the one female in the tournament to flirt with him is funny. There is  a sub-plot of a man, Papageorge,without a hotel room,bedding down wherever he can,ending up sleeping under a table in the conference room,where he is woken by a couples' therapy group and subjected to a rebirthing. There's also a mix-up where the chess players have to share the conference room with the new agers. A couple of swingers attempt to seduce Peter without success. Machine-man who avoids social development clashes with more liberated forms of social behaviour. Minorities like ""the African"" and ""the woman"" stick out like sore thumbs.

Drab realism mutates into surrealistic effects,blips.bleeps,jumps,split screens,speeded-up film,coloured loops of repeated footage. Machines fall victim to glitches;TSAR 3.0's propensity for `committing suicide',pointlessly sacrificing Queens or chasing after pawns. Inconsistencies move in like inserted bugs,with technical hiccups, bizarre shot choices,streaking,haloed images, contributing to narrative dysfunction. There is a strain of paranoia,the suspicion of spooks from the Pentagon,lurking about the competition,looking to apply these technologies to the military-industrial-complex. The idea of computer dating is nascent. To the classic mind the grid square is a liberating system with endless possibilities,butto the hippies this shows the limits of a square existence. In their way these oddball independents are struggling to break free of limited mind-sets and bereborn. An image of a camera pointing at the sun,mirrors the Icarus-like hubris of computer geeks overstretching their equipment to soar. Bujalski has made quite a film layered like a seed-bed,germinating thoughts long afterwards.",1399420800,,3839,5.848214285714286
5929648,1,B00EO2I6PQ,"Shot in grainy black-and-white, the ultra-low budget ""Computer Chess"" is the type of movie that gives art films a bad name among audiences who never go to art films. Slow-moving, meandering and technically unpolished (to put it mildly), it might be of interest to anyone who has a fascination with computers, chess or possibly both. Anyone else will likely be bored to tears by this static tale of a group of early '80s nerds attending a tournament designed to determine which tech team has come up with the most effective computer chess program.

The movie is obviously intended as a satire of sorts about the ancient days of computer technology and those who have an easier time interacting with technology than with their fellow human beings. It also makes fun of Man's relentless quest to create artificial intelligence, but the whole thing is so lacking in clarity, energy and humor that I imagine that half the audience will have drifted out of the theater long before the midway point, while the other half will be in too much of a stupor to get up and leave.",1397520000,,1066,4.731182795698925

5929653,1,B00EO2I6PQ,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

In 1984, I was invited by a friend to a poker game, who happened to have the latest in video equipment at the time and taped all the raunchy conversations between the games' participants, for most of the night. With a little editing, I mind's well submit this old tape to the Sundance Festival. Given the current mindset of most film critics today, with their preening and slavish devotion to anything in the least nostalgic, I might have a good chance of winning some kind of award.

I can find no other explanation as to why the critics were taken in by 'Computer Chess', except for this love of nostalgia. Certainly it's not the Computer Chess plot that is at all engaging; creator Andrew Bujalski saw to that. But what he did do was shot the film on the old Portapak cameras, giving one the impression that this mockumentary, about a computer chess convention, actually took place in the early 1980s. As we gaze up on the screen, we see that Bujalski mimics old video--the dimensions aren't large enough to fill the entire theater screen (just like my old 1984 video appears, when I play it back on my computer today). Bujalski also populates the screen with images of beloved old computers and text from word processors, which none of us have seen in decades.

So it's a sort of hypnotism that's going on here. It doesn't really matter what happens as far as the story is concerned. It's a meandering affair, where we can get the basic idea in the first fifteen minutes. Think 'The Big Bang Theory' meets 'Bobby Fischer'. A group of nerds have developed software programs, which they pit against one another over games of chess. The games take place at a low-rent hotel where there are two other groups in attendance: a new age group led by a guru from Africa and a bunch of swingers.

Bujalski is actually aiming for laughs in this lightweight spoof. His main nerd is a boorish guy who discovers that the hotel never received his reservation, so he's forced to crash in different rooms of his fellow convention attendees, every night. Due to a mix up, the nerds must share their convention room with the new age group and there's also another bit, where a libidinous couple attempts to seduce another one of the nerds, without success.

Computer Chess is strictly for those who have a nostalgic longing for the early 80s. It's a film with a little style but virtually no substance. While Bujalski looks sympathetically at his computer nerds, their machinations are of little consequence. For more sophisticated film-goers, avoid this lightweight debacle, like the plague.",1390089600,3,2619,4.734649122807017
5929654,3,B00EO2I6PQ,"It starts off as potentially a really good documentary, but there are too many places where a documentary film maker would not be, like at the rebirthing / human potential workshops that were going on at the same time as the computer chess competition.

But about when ""Dave"" starting hitting on the young computer nerd, I realized that it was actors.  The first part, when people were being interviewed, you expect them to not be natural, but in the after-conference motel-room sessions, where the interesting stuff takes place, it just didn't seem realistic.

Also, there wasn't enough geekiness for the computer nerds, but probably too much for those who weren't around in those days.

There were several places where I laughed out loud, and said, ""Oh, I wish I knew someone else who would enjoy this, too.""  I think that was around the time of Papageorge's wandering, but I can't remember, it might have been when the great professor starts rattling his nonsense and talks about putting new, invisible, undocumented programming into the compiler.

There aren't many films that make me laugh out loud, so I really appreciate it, but I feel like for a scripted film, it didn't really go anywhere, kind of a X-Filles, (the TV show) unresolved ending, and hints of something big behind the scenes, but not really bringing it out.",1388620800,2,1329,4.884444444444444
5929655,1,B00EO2I6PQ,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought it would be along the lines of a Christopher Guest movie.  Well, I was wrong.  It started out slow, and never really sped up.  The cinematography was thoroughly annoying.  It was dark and choppy.  I then thought that it would be one of those character movies like Napoleon Dynamite.  Well, it was never really that either because there is barely any character development either.  I thought the subplot with the swingers was going to be funny, but instead it was just awkward.

For this movie to work, I think it would need to be either a true documentary (which I think would be far more interesting), or have Christopher Guest do it.  Maybe I am just missing the point of the movie or something.

Here is what my wife said:
Absolutely, hands down the worst movie I have ever seen by far.  No plot, horrible cinematography, and boring, unlikeable characters.  It is not a documentary and it is not a comedy (I have seen it touted as both)  I can find no redeeming qualities about this movie.  I feel bad that I will not get that 91 minutes of my life back.  I would have rather witnessed paint drying for 91 minutes.",1387584000,8,1164,4.450236966824645
5929656,4,B00EO2I6PQ,"Set in and around a computer chess tournament in an anonymous hotel in the Eighties, COMPUTER CHESS takes a gently humorous look at a group of geeks - some of them are involved in computers, others in some form of transcendental meditation. Shot in black-and-white, including the kind of shots (blurred screens, switches from black-and-white to color, abrupt changes of location) that suggest amateur film-making (even though the film is very professionally made), the film looks at how geeks approach what they do with extreme seriousness, even though what they do is manifestly absurd. Myles Paige is particularly good as Pappageorge, who thinks of himself as a computer whizkid but ends up having a weekend from hell at the computer convention. There are some very funny set pieces, especially when one computer geek finds himself in a bedroom with a husband-and-wife from the transcendental meditation group, who are both dedicated to the idea of free love. Although set in the past, COMPUTER CHESS can be understood in terms of the present; there are just as many geeks around now, whose technical obsessions render them unaware of the daily realities of the world around them.",1385337600,,1182,5.097938144329897

8607274,5,B00EO2I6PQ,"A highly entertaining science fiction comedy set in circa 1980, Computer Chess is a story about a bunch of nerdy computer chess programmers who gather at a seedy motel to compete in a chess tournament. Their prize: $7,500 and a chance for their computer program to play against a real human chess master.

This indie film was written, directed, and produced by Andrew Bujalski, and features actors whose faces and names Ive never seen before in movies or on TV. Bujalski uses grainy black-and-white video to give viewers the feel of the era of the 1970s and 80s. Everything from clothes to cars, computer equipment, and even the hotel where the action is set all perfectly reflect the times. Odd characters abound in the film, from members of an encounter group who practice birthing ceremonies every morning, to Persian cats that seem to proliferate, and a woman hanging around the hotel who may be a lot more than she seems

The comedy is relatively low-key and subtle, and the actors all do a very good job of delivering their lines with mock seriousness. There is a substantial theme running through the film: the role of computers in society, and a growing awareness of artificial intelligence and its impact on everyday life.

I think Computer Chess is a bit of an odd film, but I found it highly entertaining and quite thought provoking. I have now watched it three times and have enjoyed it very much each time. Highly recommended.",1491091200,2,1439,4.771084337349397

If you have ever wondered whether there is a difference between computer and human intelligence, this movie is for you!  This movie is a true gem, from its aesthetics (a range of primitive computers, light-sensitive video cameras, 70s motel carpeting, retro fashion, cats, etc.) to the subject matter (brute force vs ""feminine"" programming, bad role models such as Tesla, late night chess analysis, swinging mystics, etc.).  Despite being set in the past, all the questions pondered in the movie are more relevant than ever.  If Papageorge ever got his opponent's evaluation log, what would it show?!?

After watching it, I looked at the blurb and was startled to see it described as a comedy! Maybe the fact that the plot made no sense entitled it to be regarded as a ""comedy of the absurd."" The ""found footage"" plague has been infecting indie movies in recent years and this was one of the worse examples (though not the worst, since that prize probably goes to Decasia).

This low-key surreal comedy is an absurd delight.  I knew nothing about it going in and actually thought that it was a documentary for a few minutes, which is a testament to its improvised, cinema-verite style.  There are no big laughs, but I was constantly amused.  There is also some kind of couples therapy love-in going on at the same hotel, and writer / director Andrew Bujalski gets a lot of mileage from the juxtaposition of the intellectual and the spiritual.  They each make the other seem ridiculous in comparison, perhaps making the point that neither is sufficient in and of itself.",1437004800,,703,4.825
