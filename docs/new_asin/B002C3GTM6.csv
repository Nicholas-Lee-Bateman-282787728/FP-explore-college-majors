3903217,5,B002C3GTM6,My wife and I got see a few clips of this which were shown before another film screening we were attending. I laughed out loud a couple of times! Can't wait to see the entire film.,1247097600,3,180,4.027777777777778
3903218,5,B002C3GTM6,I was fortunate to see this production in pre-release and my wife and I were grateful for the opportunity. We thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The plot is hilarious only bested by the antics of the actors... highly recommended to anyone that's been married or has attended a wedding! Wedding Crashers has some serious competition in the genre! Makes a great wedding gift as long as the happy couple watches it after their nuptials.,1246320000,5,428,4.876712328767123

8362988,5,B002C3GTM6,"Wedding Bros is at once hilarious and, dare I say it? loving. Anyone who grew up with a brother or a sister they frequently battled but always loved  will throughly enjoy this flick! I recently purchased a copy based on the reviews here and can say unequivically it is a hoot!

In this movie Dan Fogler (""Balls of Fury""), as Carmine ""the dreamer without a clue"", offers us his best work to date. Brendon Sexton III is very good as his all too serious and now ""Moonstruck"" brother, Anthony.  Jon Polito is brilliant as their seriously flawed mentor. Kudos must go to the writing and directing team of Michael Canzoniero and Marco Ricci. For rookies they hit one out of the park!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wedding-Bros/dp/B002C3GTM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wedding Bros.</a>",1250899200,,832,5.535433070866142

8362990,5,B002C3GTM6,"Saw this at the Indie Festival and it's genuinely funny. And they got a terrific performance out of Dan Fogler, who does a very human, recognizable character but never loses the comedy.",1250467200,,185,4.8125
8362991,5,B002C3GTM6,This film demonstrates the excellent abilities of the directors who also wrote the film. The actors performed their roles very well with many brilliant moments of spontaneous humor. Original music makes this film stand out and is guranteed to please. You will want to watch this movie more than once.,1249776000,,300,5.02
8362992,5,B002C3GTM6,I laughed the whole movie!! Cant wait for this to come out on DVD. I have to own it!!!,1249430400,,86,3.5789473684210527
8362993,5,B002C3GTM6,"I also got to see this film at SXSW and was really impressed. In a world where
comedies are dumbed down, this one is character driven and has
lots of heart. Fogler won the Tony Award for his role in ""Spelling Bee""
and you can see why in this film. Polito is an actor's actor and it's great to
see him with so much screen time. Kudos to the writer/directors who obviously
created this one from real life experience that they mined successfully for
lots of laughs and some warm smiles.",1249084800,2,483,4.318681318681318
