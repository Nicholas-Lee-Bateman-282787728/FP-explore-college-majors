8437293,5,B004OSZSVU,"Fun, nostalgic, serial entertainment from the wartime(1940's), offering 12 episodes in the deepest, ""darkest jungles"" of South America.

First, you must have a inkling for watching these oldtime chliffhangers.  They're made on a low budget, corny, and repetitive.  If, like me, you enjoy pure escapist adventure with lots of stuntwork and romantic, imaginery settings and simple good guy vs. bad guy, then, Perils of Darkest Jungle, aka, The Tiger Woman is for you.

Amiable and good to the core, Allan Lane's character goes to the jungles of South America to discover why oil men and local tribesmen are being murdered.  He gains the trust of the Tiger Woman, the region's jungle queen(although white) and soon they're battling greedy baddies.  The episodes run about 15 minutes or so(longer in the first one) and always include a good fight and a ""Did they die?"" cliffhanger.

Linda Stirling, model turned movie serial queen, does a super job.  She's elegant and tough.  Her acting's a bit stilted but she's ready for action and mixes it up with the best of them.  The first crook she fights, she does judo on him and takes him down; another one, she lifts him over her head, spins him around and tosses him.  She rides, shoots, punches, saves the day, and manages to do all that while wearing an outfit that looks like it should come from the ""Kit Kat NightClub"" in Manhatten: short skirt, gloves, cat hat with ears and hair, coiffured perfectly.  Interestingly, this was her first serial, and she's well known for these, and when she finished her last, she pretty much retired to family life and went to college for a degree and eventually teaching.

Even with a small budget, the editing and acting is fine.  The stuntmen and woman are excellent.  They excel at horsebackriding, fisticuffs, and falls.  It's absolutely amazing watching these artist dish it out- crashing over tables and through doors, dropping off cliffs after being bloodlessly shot, and it's in every episode.  They, definitely, took pride in their work- I wonder how many injuries they had?

They use a few background mattes and do shoot a fair amount of outdoor scenes.  You wonder on each episode, what cliffhanger this time: firepit, explosives, waterfall, crushing elevator, etc.  And, of course, how they escaped, to be seen on the next.

Obviously, no sex, blood, or language, but there's plenty of killing.  The bullet hits them; they grab their chest; fall off cliff.  There's even capital punishment- a murderer being dropped into a firepit/volcano after dancing native girl gives the sign to cut the rope.

If you need CGI, complicated characters and story, look elsewheres; otherwise, grab your popcorn, turn down the lights, and let your inner kid travel to dangerous Perils of Darkest Jungle and Tiger Woman.",1424304000,3,2796,4.963440860215054
8437294,4,B004OSZSVU,"I'm 73 as I write this, and saw this in kiddie matinees when age 10, and loved every scary minute of it.  Now, aside from nostalgic
value, I can only say, it is more entertaining for its cheesy shlock value than anything else.  Each of the 12 chapters has a fight
scene, totally phony looking, a bad guy accidentally shooting one of his own, long bloodless gunfights, corny dialogue spoken as
if it is being read, and a scene at the end where the hero apparently meets his doom, only to find out at the beginning of the following
chapter after a brief review, that one detail was omitted, allowing him or her to escape death.  More laughs than thrills for adult
viewers, but if you experienced these serials as a child, it is fun to see them now through grownup eyes, and wonder how you could
have not seen through their ridiculousness when you were a kid.",1416873600,3,856,4.405063291139241
