6605370,4,B00N1JQ18W,"You know, I find myself deviating quite a bit from the cookie-cutter mold that acts as found-footage film these days, but I will confidently say that this was a great bit of fresh air within a diminishing genre. The premise in and of itself should draw audiences in--this is not your run-of-the-mill ""let's go to this haunted location and film some spooky stuff, gang!"" sort of movie. Instead, the writer weaved in a unique approach as to why this particular student conducts the video surveillance in the first place.

Aside from some pretty decent, if not overly cheesy, jump scares throughout the piece, just watching Deb deteriorate throughout the film is enough to pull at anyone's emotions. So as to not give far too much away, keep in mind a few items prior to diving in.

First, yes, this is a found-footage/mockumentary style film. It does not try to be anything more or less; it is what it is.

Second, the acting is...actually quite superb. I would not go so far as to say this warrants an Oscar of any kind, but Deb's character construction is simply terrifying. They could not have selected a more capable actress for the role.

Lastly, just have a bit of fun. Turn the volume up, shut off the lights, maybe get a glass of wine or two in you, and just appreciate the film for what it is. I sincerely hope we have the privilege of other FF/mockumentary style filmmakers taking heed from an instant addition to the saturated market currently in place. Every once in a blue moon it is nice to see an old friend show up with some unique clothing after such a long absence, and that's really what this film does for the genre in and of itself. Seriously worth the rent, and I'll be so bold as to even buy this when I catch it out on BR.",1414022400,33,1744,4.4576802507836994
6605371,4,B00N1JQ18W,"One of the best possession themed films since ""The Exorcist"". No where near as good as that, but def a good film. If you like horror you should like this.",1414022400,11,154,4.166666666666667
6605372,4,B00N1JQ18W,"I am surprised at how good this movie actually was. As all fans of horror flicks know, there are some real dud movies out there this wasn't actually one of them.

Without being specific so as to not spoil it I will vaguely describe what I liked.
1. There was a character that actually added two and two together and hastily left the situation! This was so shockingly refreshing!
2. There was an actual storyline that did not attempt to mimic the ""What really happened?"" trend.
3. Though a bit drawn out initially, once things started moving they just kept building steam.
4. (This is the big one for me) Overall every major character was intelligent. Any denial of what was going on is quickly squashed and those that stay to handle the situation make a plan and do everything in their power to see it through.

Overall the filming was well done for the ""documentary"" style and there were actually those moments of classic suspense where you now something will happen so you brace for it, and it still gets to you just a bit.

The use of sound to build tension and mood was well done in my opinion. I admit to not being in any way knowledgeable about making movies, but I enjoyed this film and will probably force some of my buddies, who have sat through more Horror films than they ever dreamed could be made, to watch this with me.

If you are looking for a good horror flick I think this one was by far one of the best I have seen in a while.",1413849600,63,1445,4.321033210332104

6605398,5,B00N1JQ18W,"I'm a big fan of horror, but am still pretty critical. I don't love anything automatically just because it fits the genre. I really wish I could, because it would make it easier for me to find stuff to watch, but I just can't get into a lot of stuff that's out there. I'm also not a huge fan of possession movies or found footage films. So it took me a while to get around to watching The Taking of Deborah Logan, but I was really surprised by how good this movie was. I even watched it again the next day while it was still available during the rental.

Jill Larson is unbelievable as the title character. She manages to be convincingly frail while also putting in a very physical performance. The surrounding characters are good, Deborah's daughter is especially likable. Thankfully, there is no pointless attempt to create intricate backstories for the supporting characters. There is nothing wrong with getting to know the people in the movie, but a lot of these found footage films spend an annoying amount of time on dialogue between the people shooting the film and all it ever does is showcase poor scripts and bad acting.

The documentary crew that are responsible for the footage the movie is put together from are the usual list of found footage horror kids. The cool reversal would be Mia, the one running the project. Normally, the character that endlessly ignores all of the very obvious signs that there is something wrong, and continually pushes people to ""see it through to the end,"" is a man. But in TODL, it is the ambitious Mia that puts everyone's lives in peril because they would rather get their footage than be sensible. Of course, it is a found footage flick, so  by the end, one gets tired of the frantic squealing and people yelling over one another. It''s kept to a minimum though, and doesn't ruin the experience.
Would recommend to anyone that wants to see a scary movie.

There are some great comedic lines too. ""How many attics do you people have?"" and ""He's shooting my mom's minivan!"" are both memorable.",1494547200,,2039,4.624309392265193

6605400,5,B00N1JQ18W,"One of the most disturbing movies I have seen. Well acted, well written, and well directed. Touches anyone who has gone through the tragic journey of Alzheimers with a parent. About midway into the story, some unexplainable and shocking events are captured on video. The scene in the caves near the end is horrifying. This is definitely a movie not for younger viewers. Highly recommended.",1493424000,,389,5.0
6605401,4,B00N1JQ18W,"This movie was alot of fun...I would have given it 5 stars, but the ending was a bit...goofy.
 Fortunately, I've never had to experience the grief associated with Alzheimer's. but I'd imagine this is very much what it feels like.
Though it is found footage, which has become the standard of Horror, this movie is original in its own sense. A student and her film crew intend to make a documentary on what is is like to live with a crippling disease like Alzheimer's, but realize they are dealing with a separate, even more horrifying entity.
The first half of the movie makes it feel like you are just watching a movie about a daughter trying to cope with her creepy mother's disease. It's a very real experience that anyone could have to live through. That alone could have held it's own as a scary movie.
Then they introduce another aspect to the film. A less...possible..but equally terrifying issue that the daughter and the film crew must experience.
The movie does a good job of tying the two together. The idea that a weakened, deteriorating mind is more susceptible to possession from an evil entity.
My only gripe with the movie is what happens in the end. I won't spoil anything, but if you watch it, you will likely know which scene I am talking about. It is during the scene in the cave.
Alzheimer's is real, and something that anyone could have to deal with. Possession, depending on your beliefs, is not exactly real, but can still have a devastating effect on a person's well being. Both of these aspects make this film a terrifying story.",1492300800,,1554,4.610108303249097

6605430,2,B00N1JQ18W,Creepy movie about an elderly woman who has Alzheimer's /dementia and becomes possessed by some ancient evil spirit. It is hokey and leaves the viewer with an unsettling feeling about losing their faculties altogether.,1478217600,,218,5.4411764705882355
6605431,2,B00N1JQ18W,"I started watching this unaware it was all scripted, as I like psychological documentaries,  but its fictional nature became obvious pretty quickly. At that point I found it insulting as it depicts alzheimers and mental illness symptoms associated with fictional satanic / evil elements. It came across to me as stigmatizing and exploitative. Eventually I found it comedic how terrified the other characters were of a suffering mentally ill woman who needed help. Some of the jump scares made me roll my eyes and I'm usually prone to those. There was an excessive amount of flashlights in the dark with shaky Blair Witch style camera. I guess if you believe in demonic possession, and are afraid of snakes, it has potential to be scary.",1476748800,,736,4.935483870967742

6605476,4,B00N1JQ18W,"Yes, THE TAKING OF DEBORAH LOGAN is another one of those ""found footage"" movies. Yes, this means there's lots of scenes w/ people running around in dark places, screaming. Yes, I STILL wonder why someone is always carrying a camera around, NO! MATTER!! WHAT!!! CRAZY!!!! S**T!!!!! HAPPENS!!!!!! And yet... I enjoyed this movie. The main reason is the character of Deborah Logan (Jill Larson), an apparent Alzheimer's patient who inspires the film crew, led by college student, Mia Medina (Michelle Ang), to document her every move. Ms. Larson goes into places that most actresses of her vintage, probably wouldn't even consider! Her role reminded me of the brilliantly believable degradation suffered by Ellen Burstyn's character, in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Larson is the obvious standout of TTODL. In addition to her contribution, this movie also has one of those rarest of commodities, an original story! The idea of adding an eeevil presence to the mix is perfectly played! Even w/ all of the blood, and other goo, the plot is the most unsettling part. The final sequence, while familiar-looking, still manages to add some bizarre, unexpected twists.

The Taking of Deborah Logan, while some consider in the ""found footage"" genre, didn't come across as one.  Strong, solid acting by an extremely talented cast, and an awesome director and storyline made for a nail-biting, on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller.  This is truly one of the best fright films to come along in quite a while.  I recommend this to anyone bored with the usual shaky-camera, ""build-up to nothing""-type films.

6605511,2,B00N1JQ18W,This movie was a total disaster. The performances were Beyond melodramatic. The plot was totally predictable and the characterizations (especially that of the big scary dead French serial killer/serpent) were entirely infantile.

But ultimately, it lapses into predictable flashlight photography a la ""Blair Witch.""  Nobody thinks to turn anything on except for a flashlight when chasing demons around in the dark.

6605537,5,B00N1JQ18W,"Brilliant and emotionally claustrophobic film about what happens to an adult daughter when her mother becomes someone she no longer recognizes .
Dementia features heavily in the film - as an actual plot point and as a deep and consistent metaphor. I don't want to spoil any part of the movie, but it resonated deeply with me as I try to cope with my own mother's baffling and inappropriate behavior. Her wandering. Her losing stuff. Her telling people I'm dead. And telling me people are hurting her or stealing from her.

The Taking of Deborah Logan is far more terrifying that what I am going through, but at its core, it dramatizes the bedrock terror of watching your mother disappear from the inside out. Acting was fantastic. Direction was good. Cinematography could have been a little better - some of the effects seemed off.

This is one of those rare finds when the writing is great, the direction, spot-on and ALL of the actors gave stellar performances. It was creative in the way that the filmmakers are ""making a documentary about a woman who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and capturing her daily life as the disease progresses"" because the viewer finds out that is NOT the only thing Deborah Logan is suffering from. There was just enough character development to make the viewer care about what happens to these people, who are all completely believable in their roles and it's extremely scary and disturbing, as well!

You want to reach into the movie and fix what's going on, but no, you are just a spectator and have to just watch. This is a possession movie, but you will find yourself transported and all of the sudden you care. Give this one a chance, you will buy into the premise.",1438300800,,399,4.0
6605618,5,B00N1JQ18W,"I am in love with this movie.  Though it tries to be found footage, the fact that the actors are recognizable from other projects kills that thrill.

This is a well paced, intelligent horror film which blends the bizarre behavior normally associated with Alzheimer's Disease and demonic possession.  It is hard to know where the line is crossed.
One or two good jump scares.  Not too much by way of visual horrors.  Mostly audio and acting.
The actors make this film work.  Nothing short of a brilliant performance would.  It does not settle into ""talking head"" mode, which neatly removes it from an intellectual work.  Smart, but still knows it is a horror movie.
There is a rare break where someone realizes something supernatural is happening and leaves.  Don't see that everyday except in satires and spoofs.
The characters are sympathetic and real.
There is one hackneyed gimmick in the film.  The lights are off for no apparent reason a couple of times but I found myself forgiving it since it heightened the tension nicely.
This one is a keeper.  I am glad I bought it.  It belongs in a horror collection.",1438300800,,1112,4.734375

6605625,2,B00N1JQ18W,"As another reviewer stated - this movie started out promising. About 3/4 of the way through, they seem to have lost the script and started just improvising. Lots of shrieking and screaming curse words at every turn (I don't mind swearing, I have a potty mouth - but it was just over the top). There aren't very many movies I won't finish - but this was one of them. I gave up about 10 minutes before it ended. I just didn't care anymore and the shrieking became intolerable. This could have been a good movie - if they had finished writing the script. Oh, and as for the acting, sub-par all around, but as too be expected with a B (at the most) type movie. I am SHOCKED to see the high star rating on Amazon (lots of bad indie movies have high reviews - moms, dads, sisters, cousins, all get online to write positive reviews).

6605634,4,B00N1JQ18W,"I went into this knowing nothing. Rented it for KIndle. I was so impressed. This is a case where you could have a story full of tired recent genre clich's and quite a bit of familiar ground yet it rose above all that and was incredibly good. Why? The actresses playing the parts of Deborah and her daughter. Absolutely fantastic. Jill Larson in particular is astoundingly good, so much so that I often forgot this was an actress acting. She INHABITS a role calling for quite a bit of not-at-all flattering moments. From the moment she first appears right through until the end she owns the screen. Which is good, because the actors playing the crew documenting her are all-too-realistically shallow. (whether this was intentional is hard to say at times, though, it's SO evident during the woman's voice-over to the bits we see of her ""finished"" work) They're not BAD, they're just shown up every time the two main actresses are onscreen, b/c they are so natural and real and don't overact. I do feel the story strays too much when it gets into the cliche' of seeking out the help of a professor in a local college who is an expert in the more mysterious goings-on. He dumps the information very matter-of-factly and this drains the WTF? what's-going-on scariness from things. And, were it not for Anne Ramsay as the daughter, the ridiculous ""burning"" scenes would've fallen flat on their faces. Oh, and, as I'd been warned, the filmmakers do save a doozy of a ""reveal"" for near the end of the film. Something so wrong and disturbing it's been stuck in my head since. I don't know if this is reminiscent of any other recent horror film b/c I don't really watch many current films. For me, it was ""fresh"". So, despite the parts that didn't quite work, the solid POV camera work and acting SOLD it to me.

6605666,1,B00N1JQ18W,"Artistically and technically this movie is imaginative and reasonably well thought out.

I do have an issue with the ethical nature of this film.
Alzheimers is a dreadful disease; actually any disease is dreadful, and I do have issues with focusing on an individual and her sole care provider as the main focus of their ""documentary"" which then turns into a case of demonic possession.

I also wonder if any of the filmmakers connected with the making of this movie has ever experienced being a sole care provider or had a family member with a debilitating disease.
I wonder, because they may have thought twice before embarking on this venture and secondly knowing that ""Deborah"" is prone to sudden and unpredictable moments of extreme violence, no thinking person would have permitted her to sit in the front seat with the driver.

I'm sure that for everybody else this will be a very entertaining film; sorry to be such a killjoy.",1432339200,,933,4.81875

6605685,2,B00N1JQ18W,"A crew wants to create a documentary on an old lady who's suffering from Alzheimers. So they take their cameras and begin the documentary. Soon strange things start happen as the sufferer begins to show sleepwalking and sometimes even levitates to the confused amusement of the onlookers. While the protagonist, Deborah Logan's character, was acted out really well by Jill Larson. I felt the rest of the acting was too bad to be taken seriously. Also the story line suffers from several detours it takes and introduces new characters almost half way through the film! This adds confusion and also bored me from the original title. There are some moments where the film tries to scare you but eventually there is nothing much it does to induce any fear other than resort to cliches and a plot that makes no sense at all.

The only good thing this film has going for it is Jill Larson's portrayal of Deborah Logan. Other than that, I think it was lacklustre, the story was awful just plain awful and the acting, don't even get me started. The daughter of the protagonist was painfully bad and liked to explore things like a teenager. The film tried to add subtitles when people spoke in hush tones and wanted this to appear original but it all just fell flat on it's face.

Watch the last 15 minutes and tell me you take it seriously and i'll think this is probably your first horror. My wife and I both thought we should have watched ""Drag me to hell"" instead. Looked more inviting. One of the better horrors I have seen recently was THE BABADOOK. This film is not even worth a viewing.",1427500800,,1585,4.557894736842106
6605706,4,B00N1JQ18W,"I have watched my string of horror movies and I'm a bit jaded about the documentary style that is so prevalent and not well executed. So I expected this one to be just like the resthowever, I was intrigued that the documentary crew was actually trying to document the progress of a woman dealing with the onset of Alzheimer's disease--not anything out of the ordinary or remotely demonic in nature.

This was cleverly done and imagined. Are there elements you will recognize? Yes. But it works in favor of the story line as well as the directing, which was, I thought, pretty darn good. The most impressive element to this movie was the ability to create a sense of dread that got tenser and more creepy as you watched. The fact that you already know something bad or horrible is about to happen and still holding your breath, that's not a small feat in this genre.

The actors draw you in--especially that of Jill Logan, who is our main character. I really felt that there was nothing amiss or wrong or even choppy about any aspect of this film. I jumped several times and I was left feeling really freaked out afterwards. Not, oh, another one of those movies or thinking it was really lame and boring. It kept my attention from beginning to end. I also think on a second watch, I'll see things I didn't see before, and that's always fun too.

I was extremely well done, and though there is very little that scares me, I actually got scared. It was very well written, extremely well acted and for me, believable...I am very grateful that possession is not a common occurrence, but it would make sense that an Alzheimer patient would be susceptible. I am fairly sensitive to subtlety, so for me the pacing was perfect - masterful filmmaking... whew! The story begins, as some of the other reviews offered, with a documentary film crew, headed by a PHD student doing a study of Alzheimer's,  arriving at the house of Deborah Logan, a gracious and intelligent middle aged woman. They are greeted by Deborah's grown daughter, Sarah, who acts as Deborah's caretaker and the film crew's 'hostess'. She is, more or less, the head of the house as Deborah's condition worsens, having left her home in 'Richmond'(?) to come take care of her ma. Both Deborah and Sarah are written and acted with depth and utter believability. We care what happens to them. There is, besides the film crew - who are important characters but much smaller parts - a neighbor who, while he doesn't have a lot of screen time, is an important figure. And there are snakes....always a plus! The film's progression and ending are not necessarily predictable, but make utter sense. Another interesting take on evil.",1425513600,,1416,4.80327868852459

6605838,4,B00N1JQ18W,"MY CALL:  This film came out of nowhere and blew away viewer expectations by bringing us smart characters, a creepiness that developed with the story, and a not-so color by numbers plot.  Very good horror film.

The Taking of Deborah Logan tells a story that we haven't already heard a dozen times and it tells the story well.  Deborah (Jill Larson; Shutter Island) is a charming early stage Alzheimers disease patient living with her anxious caregiving daughter (Anne Ramsay; Planet of the Apes, Critters 4).  In exchange for much needed financial compensation, they agree to let PhD student Mia (Michelle Ang; Underemployed) and her audio-visual team stay with them, record them, and study the effects Alzheimers disease has on the unafflicted surrounding family members.

Something that I always must point out is when a horror movie does a good job of getting to know its characters and getting us to like them and invest in their well-being.  From the very start, I wanted to learn more about Deborah, her daughter, and the academic team studying them.  First-time feature-length director Adam Robitel did such a GREAT job, in fact, that it didn't feel like a horror movie at all at firstand I didn't care.  If this movie turned out to be a family drama I still would have wanted to see these characters develop.  Whats more is that the story in no way relied on the characters stupid decisions to move forward.  The story unfolded as the characters, in fact, made wise or at least credible decisions in an incredible situation.  Amazing job--and a great storytelling victory for the horror genre to close out 2014.

Mias team watches as Deborahs episodes and symptoms worsen at an accelerating rate and, with these episodes intensity, we also see a greater and more frequent danger to Mias team.  The characters great freaked out for good reasons, and things just keep getting creepier and weirder as we begin to learn more about what is causing Deborahs disease to become so aggressive and more about her mysterious history with her close friend living next door.  The story finds good synthesis, great creepiness, and appropriately effective gore and shock value without trying to compete with overblown shock cinema.

This film was rich with scares and all of them for legitimate reasons.no loud noises and camera angles to spur needless jumps.  The scares had effective, creepy build-up and even when you saw them coming they were still shocking.  Whats more is that the shocks and their creepy build-ups both appropriately amplify as the movie shifts from its subtle beginnings to its moderately intense end.

You may have noticed that I have gone out of my way to reveal EXTREMELY little about this film (other than the photos in this review).  Why?  Well, its one of the best horror films of 2014 and it deserves to not be spoiled.and YOU deserve to be surprised.  Just know thisits NOT a found footage film although there is a good deal of documentary style filming/camera-work, it is supernatural in nature, and its something of a horror mystery.

6605841,2,B00N1JQ18W,"Deborah Logan has Alzheimer's or so her doctor, her daughter, and the camera crew that has come to film the sad deterioration of her mind believe. What they don't know is that Deborah is possessed, and regardless of what they do, they can't free Deborah from the evils that haunt her.

It's a solid premise, although not necessarily new. And Jill Larsen, the actress that plays Deborah, performs with more dignity and credibility that the film deserves.

The problem with the movie (and there are many) is not its slow pace, although that is a problem. Nor is it the gaps in logic, though that is indeed another problem. The true problem is that the movie isn't scary. There's no tension, there are no jumps in the night, there are no thrills. Why? Because no character is ever in any real danger until the last twenty minutes of that movie. And by that time, we wish that someone would not just take Deborah but the whole cast with her.

6605891,4,B00N1JQ18W,"The story begins with an intro from Mia where she declares her intent for this project. They quickly arrive at Deborahs home and are welcomed by her daughter Sarah, who is only doing this because Mia is paying for this opportunity and Deborahs medical bills have left the family strapped for cash. Deborah is a nice lady at first, although she is not very receptive to being filmed constantly in the privacy of her own home. Soon enough, the crew witnesses one of Deborahs violent outbursts and gets a full-frontal view of the chaos Sarah must deal with on a daily basis. The spooks begin early, with a creepy scene appearing at the 16-minute mark and several more at the 22, 24, and 27 minute marks. This makes for one hell of a first act and a smart move by the writers to suck you in early. The second act shows us more of the medical aspect of Deborahs condition, with doctors stumped over what is causing the terrible infections and rashes covering her body. Sure enough, the scares don't stop, and we get the first truly solid scene 32 minutes into the film. I was quite impressed with the writing here, as this is a scare that you know is coming, yet the add-ons to the spook make it one that was more effective than it should have been. As the story builds Deborahs outbursts continue, and revelations about her past arise. The horror then grows as locations move from the home to the hospital, and then another location where you will witness one of the creepiest scenes of 2014.

I enjoyed the horror seen here and that is about all the film has to offer. The characters involved serve as platforms for Deborah and contribute little to the film on their own. Is this a bad thing? Not really, because I did not notice it very much until after the film. I will say that this would have been a more fulfilling effort had there been characters I actually gave a damn about, but with the most important element, the horror, intact I won't balk at this too much.

Robitels direction is great for a first-timer and is directly responsible for my enjoyment of the film. With not much more to offer than the horror itself he excelled in making this a creepier experience than expected. The atmosphere and sets used are fantastic, employing a home full of dark corners and shadows that would leave me in constant fear if I were to be looking for a missing Deborah in the middle of the night. Actress Jill Larson was an excellent choice as Deborah, giving a haunting performance even during scenes where she had no words, just a deathly stare. To my surprise Robitel relied on practical effects for the horror, including a certain snake-esque scare scene that literally left me in awe. On top of this his execution of the horror was fantastic. The scenes are drawn-out to force the viewer into a nervous state, and great POV cinematography leaves us face-to-face with the horror on many occasions.

Overall, The Taking of Deborah Logan is quite the achievement for first-timer Adam Robitel. He manages to deliver one of the better found-footage films of recent time, with an emphasis on good scares and solid atmosphere. The experience could have been better, as with every horror film out there, but if you are into the found-footage scene you should probably give this one a watch.",1419811200,,3282,4.597269624573379

When the film changed into a hand-held horror film I still felt a little awkward watching a non-serious film on a serious subject...but I got over it.

Yes the film was going along great and then it happened. the same thing that happens in all of these type of films which now passes for entertainment: Let's shoot in the dark/flashlight with a jerky camera and people shouting and screaming. Want to make it good? Pay the electric bill and mount the camera. I understand they invented this thing called a tripod.

It is a good movie if you can handle the flashlight screaming and not being able to watch the film near the end. I can't.

6605999,5,B00N1JQ18W,"If youve read my reviews for some time then you know Im not a fan of what is known as found footage films. For me it usually involves jumpy camera shots that add nothing to the suspense being filmed and just makes me nauseous. That being said on occasion a truly good movie in this genre comes along, but not often. That cant be said of THE TAKING OF DEBORAH LOGAN, one of the scariest and disturbing movies Ive seen in some time.

The basis for the film revolves around a grad student named Mia (Michelle Ang) who is shooting her thesis around the life of a victim of Alzheimers disease, Deborah Logan (Jill Larson). Mia has contacted Deborah through her daughter Sarah (Anne Ramsey), dedicated to her mother but dealing with problems of her own. One of those problems is finances which will improve with the money Mia is paying her to film Deborahs story.

Mia and her team set the house up with cameras so they can monitor Deborah in every area of the house as the disease takes its toll on her. When they begin those effects will be long term and take some time to manifest as Deborah is in the early stages. But things aren't always what they seem.

Where most Alzheimers patients deal with things like memory loss or short term forgetfulness Deborah has symptoms unlike most patients. She is prone to rages that result in battles with those trying to help her. Eventually as the movie progresses she also begins to do things like have a rash appear on her body which in turn causes her to pull strips of skin from her body. As these symptoms become more alarming shes taken to the hospital rather than allowed to stay home. Those days have her under observation but she eventually returns to the home she loves.

While we watch the deterioration of Deborah we also get a glimpse into the life of Sarah at the same time. We learn about her personal life, about her hopes to one day sell the house and return to her own place. While she continues to drink throughout the film its never quite to the point that it affects her taking care of her mother. But there is something thats always there beneath the surface that were not privy to at first.

Back in her home Deborah begins to show more signs of being not quite there. Footage shot with stationary cameras show her moving faster than seems possible with the time stamp on display. Sleepwalking leads to her doing incredibly strange things like hammering nails into the window panes to nail the windows shut, windows that are later flung open as if the nails were not there. She begins walking the grounds of the property in the middle of the night seeking something but never quite saying what. When Sarah begins to understand what she might be looking for the movie takes a turn into a whole different plane. At that time we begin to wonder is Deborah truly dealing with Alzheimers disease or is something more deadly, more sinister at work here. Trust me when I say you don't want to know the answer but will watch anyway to find out.

The movie works because of one simple thing, it seems real. Rather than have the non-stop jumping camera work seen in so many we fluctuate between that and the surveillance cameras that are picking up what is happening. The combination of the two along with most scenes being shot in a darkened room with nothing more than the light on the camera for illumination makes for some truly skin crawling sequences.

As the film moves into the final chapter it truly becomes frightening in a way that cant be described without revealing far too much of the story. The camerawork here combined with some fantastic effects make for images that will stick with you long after the DVD is taken out of the player. Add with that performances from all involved that make you feel this is real and not just a movie and you have a disturbing movie that qualifies as true horror.

I cant recommend this movie enough. For me, it is rare that I find a movie that will make me jump at times and make me feel uneasy. Ive seen tons of horror films over the years and few of them have that effect on me. This one made my skin crawl at times, made me jump more than once and has left images in my brain that will remain there for some time. The thing is thats all meant in a good way. To be affected like that by a movie doesnt happen often and it does that from start to finish. There is no doubt this is one that will stay on my shelf to be watched when I need a good scare or when I need to scare someone else. I dare you to watch it with the lights off.",1417564800,,4532,4.36773428232503

6606045,3,B00N1JQ18W,"Id heard some great things about The Taking of Deborah Logan over the last couple of weeks, and when one of my friends who loves horror movies said good things about it, I bumped it up on my movie queue. At the same time, as much as Id like to say that I enjoy horror movies, I end up being bored by the majority of what I see. Part of this is because, for whatever reason, my parents let me watch both It and Pet Sematary when I was 5 years old. Since then, nothings genuinely scared me, although a few horror movies have left quite an impression on me. The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, [REC], and select segments from the V/H/S movies are some of my favorites. Unfortunately, Deborah Logan is nothing I haven't seen before, and if youve seen any of the [REC] movies, any current found footage films, and anything involving possession, then youve seen 90% of this movie. There is nothing new in this one that would make me recommend it to anyone, and I was honestly shocked when I saw so many positive reviews on here and the imdb page for it. My guess is that its mostly younger viewers who are praising it.

The movie is done in the a documentary style, and the filmmakers are doing story on a woman, Deborah Morgan, with Alzheimers. Theyre good kids and mean well in their project, not wanting to exploit the woman or her condition. At first, Deborah is reluctant to take part in it, after they drive out so far to meet her, but she eventually agrees. She shows the usual signs of memory loss and behavior change at first, and things escalate very quickly. She attacks one of the men, accusing him of stealing her garden shovel, begins to rip apart at her own body, speaks with a deep voice in French, and more. As the crew investigates her home, with the help of her own daughter Sarah, they find out about a murderer that lived nearby, and get the feeling that Deborahs friend has some hidden secrets of his own, especially when hes trying to get them to leave.

The Taking of Deborah Logan follows every horror cliche in the book. Jump scare after jump scare, from someone suddenly appearing in frame, or a sudden sound off to the side during moments of silence. Did you see the third Paranormal Activity? The one where barely anything happened and most of the scares were from sounds? Yep, thats how things are here. What really bugged me was how it was shot. So many shots would be out of focus and shake around when they needed to be. A snake slithering around the ground in the dark? Shake the camera! A struggle with a couple of people several feet in front of you, that you're not involved in? Shake the camera! It was annoying more than anything and never added any suspense. I predicted a lot of what was going to happen after the 30 minute mark once the weird stuff started happening. Im no horror expert by any means, but again, if youve seen some more recent stuff like [REC] or those Paranormal Activities, youve seen a lot of this one already. It would have been more interesting if it was focused on the Alzheimers somehow. Those first 30 minutes when we learn about Deborah and see how she lives her life with the illness were fairly good. Its a shame they played it safe after this.

I will say that jill Larson, who plays Deborah, really did a fantastic job. She did incredible, pulling off the Alzheimers bit to a T. My great grandfather had it, and some of the stuff she did reminded me a lot of him. To be honest, most of the cast here did great too. The kids that play the film crew acted like most would (until near the end), and Anne Ramsay, who plays Sarah, was very convincing too. If they had better material to work with, instead of a script that seemed like a rough draft of something that was going to be much better, everyone could have taken it to another level.

In the chance that you haven't seen some of the movies Ive already mentioned here, youll probably get something out of The Taking of Deborah Logan. It just seemed too familiar, and Id be curious to know how the movie would have turned out if those other films didn't exist, especially [REC]2. It couldve been a lot worse though. It was hard for me to decide on 2 or 3 stars. If I could, Id give it 2.5 for being so basic, but Jill Larsons performance was that good. Watch it for her at the very least.",1416787200,3,4319,4.361490683229814

6606047,4,B00N1JQ18W,"This review will cover two movies: THE TAKING OF DEBORAH LOGAN and THE POSSESSION OF MICHAEL KING. Both are found-footage films existing in the horror sub-genre of otherworldly possession. Aside from that and their similar lack of interesting titles, the two movies offer radically different experiences.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Possession-of-Michael-King-HD/dp/B00M62KITS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Possession of Michael King [HD</a>] - 3 stars

There's a lot of hate out there for this film. I've given it three stars, although I'd say it actually warrants 2.5. It's not that it does anything particularly wrong; it's just that it is so formulaic and lazy that its high points get lost in the general smudge of unoriginality. The title itself is the biggest head-shaker of them all, since it pretty much gives everything away, which is my way of saying that there's not much here to give away in the first place.

Michael King is a filmmaker who makes horrible documentaries. How do I know they're horrible? Well, the movie starts with him announcing his intentions to make a documentary about his perfect family, which is about one of the stupidest topics anybody could ever come up with for a documentary. Then, when his wife meets an untimely demise, partly due to advice she took from a fortune teller, he changes the topic of his documentary. Now, he has decided to make a film that the nonexistence of a supernatural world. Any student of logic will know this is a futile task -- you can't prove a negative -- and he approaches this task by seeking out demonologists and soothsayers, and eventually attempts to raise a demon spirit. I'm not ruining anything for you if I tell you that he succeeds.

The acting in this film is great. And the special effects and various scares are not that bad. The problem is that the film gives itself away from the moment you read the title. The only thing the story has going for it is the fact that the audience doesn't know specifically how this demon will be affecting our lead. That's it. Michael has a young daughter that he barely pays attention to and who exists mostly to give the script more emotional weight. Although generally speaking this is not a bad film, it uses so many clich&eacute;d ideas and refuses to court any new or interesting territory, that it ends up being forgettable. Plus, the inclusion of a predictable stinger in the last minute or so of the film makes it feel like the whole movie has completely underestimated the intelligence of its audience. So, in the end, you have a decently done film with great actors, but a poor sense of story and pacing and, ultimately, no real plot to speak of.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Taking-of-Deborah-Logan/dp/B00OPX70KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Taking of Deborah Logan</a>&nbsp;- 4 stars

As with the previous film, this movie has some pretty stellar performances, the top of which is our lead, who is so fearless and powerful in her role, that I almost want to say she makes up for every shortcoming this movie has.

One of the biggest differences here is that this film actually has a bit of mystery and intrigue to it. Also framed as a documentary, the makers of this film originally meant to chronicle the ravages that occur with the onset of Alzheimer's, so its opening premise also makes a lot more sense. Deborah is suffering from this debilitating disease, and our student filmmaker is hoping to track her progress as the disease makes its way deeper into her system. Of course, it quickly becomes apparent that there is something greater than the biological that is afflicting this poor woman.

Although this flick suffers from a few logical bungles in the third act, it rises above Michael King's tale by actually having some backstory and suspense to its plotting, as well as by having a far more believable foundation to its found footage element. That foundation loses a bit of its steam in the last twenty minutes, but by then it's easy to forgive the film its various flaws, not just because it's given us a mythology to become interested in, but also because it very cheekily deals with all eye-rolling viewers by including them as a character: one of the members of the documentary crew leaves the film at a point when the situation becomes aggressively paranormal. Tons of horror audience members are bound to sympathize. ""Why would anyone stick around after witnessing stuff like that?"" they might say. Or, more succinctly, ""Oh, hell, no. I'm outta here."" This character makes tracks just as the film starts to really get into nutso territory, almost as if the movie was tacitly admitting that it had lost all justification for its found-footage-ness. But since the story still has the gas, it keeps itself relatively engaging in spite of its gathering lunacy, especially to its last, chilling shot.
-------------------------------

SUMMARY

I actually enjoyed THE POSSESSION OF MICHAEL KING at the time -- mostly due to its performances -- but the longer I thought about it, the less impressed I felt. And by the end, it started rapidly to fade from both my admiration and memory until it became just another strung-together necklace of cheap horror tropes, threaded through an aggressively weak underlying premise. THE TAKING OF DEBORAH LOGAN featured equally impressive performances (except by the young woman in charge of the documentary, who I felt was a big detraction), but also had an intriguing plotline, an unpredictable story, and enough uniquely creepy elements to distract from the other, less original aspects of its construction.",1416614400,2,5685,5.090128755364807

6606049,4,B00N1JQ18W,"This is another independent project where the creepy comes not from special effects or make-up, but from suspense and story. The premise is good; a mix between found-footage (Paranormal Activity) and normal film with focus on the daughter's fear for her mother.
The story involves an elderly lady who suffers from a mentally debilitating disease. Her daughter records her daily activities for medical reasons but begins to discover the cause of her mother's strange behavior is not a disease, but a far more terrifying supernatural reason.
If you are looking for blockbuster-style presentation and acting, don't bother. Neither are in abundance here as this is at the low end of low-budget. But what the film lacks in polish, it makes up for in atmosphere. A well-paced and suspenseful journey into a terrifying family secret. You won't find another Blair Witch or Paranormal Activity, but what you WILL find is a rather good, and effectively creepy low-budget horror film.",1416355200,,973,5.1645569620253164

I was pretty skeptical about it and I'm generally pretty critical of found footage movies because I love them so much and have seen so many, but my expectations were met and exceeded. It broke so many obnoxious tropes that horror movies usually follow and it was genuinely entertaining, well thought out, and original. The acting was also amazing and the characters were fleshed out and unique. I highly recommend horror fans to watch this, I was so impressed! I'd say the only shortcomings is that some of the scares are pretty predictable and the found footage style is broken once or twice but only barely and it's a LOT better than most found footage movies that have been coming out lately.",1415836800,4,893,4.552795031055901

Jill Larson gives a vulnerable, nuanced performance as Deborah Logan, a strong, independent woman who knows that she is losing her mind to the decidedly unsupernatural horror that is Alzheimer's.  Anne Ramsey also gives us a believable performance as Ms. Logan's angry, frightened daughter.

The documentary style is not allowed to interfere with the story development (too often this ""technique"" is merely a hokey distraction).  And I must respectfully disagree with reviewers who say the story starts out slow - I found the development just right for establishing these characters.

While the end is not as shocking as, say, The Last Exorcism, in most horror movies you could care less if the annoying characters live or die.  Here, you care about Ms. Logan.

This movie is definitely influenced by The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity.  Both of those films were ""ok"", not great, but ok.

Everything that happened in this movie was not only predictable but I also had the feeling like I've seen it before.  There was no original thought into making this film.  I felt that the acting was ok, not great or terrible, but on par with Paranormal Activity's acting.  There were no ""scary"" scenes, BUT, there were many scenes that were supposed to be scary.

I only watched the whole movie because I was curious how they would end it, but let me tell you,  once you get to the end, you'll regret not shutting it off after the first 5 minutes.  Don't waste your time with this trash.

Everything you want from a possession movie. A sympathetic family of innocents, a very dirty, very dark secret, many disturbing images.
I got fascinated by Anne Ramsay years ago watching Dexter. Such an unusual face, a little like Laura Dern and a little like Amy Goodman of Democracy Now. She was just a sideline in that show, but here she really is the star...her character's alcoholism, her infatuation with a local sheriff, her conflicts with her mother (Jill Larson) who is suffering from Alzheimer's and much more, all are blended brilliantly into one of the fullest characters I've seen in a while, and it's her journey that makes this movie more than just the sum of its parts.
None of which is to detract from the astounding performance by Larson. Possession movies are all about range, and Larson goes all over the spectrum here. Her Deborah Logan is prim and perfect and NOT some sweet innocent old lady. She has a hard edge, is very judgmental, naturally preoccupied in a struggle to maintain herself agains her Alzheimer's, not to mention her possession as the result of a decades old human sacrifice ritual she tried her best to put a stop to. The woman creature she morphs into during the possession is a hideous, twisted thing, malevolent and drawn from the same swampy depths as Emma Thompson's Clown from King Lear. But the real achievement is in also portraying the real ravages of Alzheimer's. At the end of the movie, having served her ritualistic purposekilling the fifth and final victim in the rite and transferring the soul of the evil magician into the body of a young cancer patient who will soon make a magical recoveryshe slips into the state so many of us have witnessed as we have cared and loved for those undergoing the end of life.

6606173,5,B00N1JQ18W,"This movie was fantastic!!  The woman who plays Deborah Logan just blew me away.  Great plot, you really feel for the charactors.  It made me jump more than a few times and I love horror movies.  Can't wait for it to come out in Blu Ray.",1414368000,,237,4.086956521739131
6606202,4,B00N1JQ18W,"If The Taking of Deborah Logan was just about a sufferer of Alzheimer's disease, it would be scary enough.  The illness robs its victims of their minds, and in turn, their humanity.  The Taking's plot walks a dangerous line in how sensitively it treats its subject matter, but the experience outside of its horror-premise is authentic enough.

I watched my grandmother deteriorate from Alzheimer's when I was quite young, but certain events still stand out vibrantly in my memory.  I recall her talking to herself in the mirror late at night, unable to realize that it was a one-way conversation.  At times, she was coherent and alert.  As the disease progressed, these periods of awareness dwindled.

My mother was an emotional wreck.  She had now lost two parents to mentally-debilitating illnesses.  I can see shades of her experience in the fantastic performance by Anne Ramsay, Deb Logan's daughter.  Ramsay has naturally sorrowful eyes, but she exudes more than sadness.  She's frustrated; tired of trying to make sense of it all; weary of her mother's inexplicable behavior.  She's steeled herself emotionally against the slow, inevitable, and bitter end she knows is just around the corner.  Throughout the film she struggles with losing a mother who's already gone but not yet dead.

Jill Larson's performance was gut wrenching in its authenticity.  We imagine ourselves as Alzheimer's victims, frightened of what we've become; of what we've lost.  But that's just not how it works.  Deb Logan isn't frightened, because she's only aware of what she's doing while she's in the driver's seat.  When an early-to-mid stage Alzheimer's patient lapses into one of their spells, who's in the driver's seat then?

The Taking's answer is, of course, much more horrific than in reality.  It's a horror movie, by the numbers, by the book.  Sure, the scares are well-crafted, and there are 30% less annoying jump scares than normal.  But when you get down to it, the movie has the same skeleton that most run-of-the-mill horror movies have.  What sets The Taking apart from the others is its humanity.  Sarah Logan loves her mother and tries desperately to help her however she can.  She doesn't understand what's happening but she's damn well going to fight it anyway.  This isn't a ""love conquers all"" story, but love sure makes a valiant effort.

The movie is not without its flaws.  It overplays various horror staples like creepy kids or people walking slowly up to a possessed person who's facing a wall.  Dude, they're gonna turn around and scream at you or something.  Mia Medina's camera crew makes a believable enough vehicle for the ""found footage"" style the movie's going after, but she doesn't actually have much to do once the plot gets going.  Police seem oddly unable to stand in the way of a middle-aged woman, a girl in her 20s, or a camera man.  Attics and basements are still bad places to go.

Overall though, Where most horror movies feature characters that couldn't die fast enough, The Taking succeeds because its principle characters are believable, and we actually care about them.  That, and I find it eerie that you could cut 5-10 minutes out of the movie - all the expressly supernatural parts - and what's left could easily be a true story.",1414368000,26,3267,4.912248628884826
6606203,4,B00N1JQ18W,"This was a very well done possesion movie, I really liked it alot.  Veteran actress Jill Larson plays the part of Deborah Logan with such perfection, that she is completely believable and very frightening.
Done in as a documentary style movie, sometimes the camera is way to jerky, which can be annoying, but the overall atmosphere is very tense.  It starts out a bit slow but the movie really picks up steam, and fast.  The characters are believable and likable.  They are not your usual blend of stupid characters, this bunch is smart which is very refreshing.
Overall, I found the story and the concept to be different from the usual fare and a welcome addition to the possesion genre.",1414368000,5,688,4.708333333333333
6606204,4,B00N1JQ18W,"A very well made and effective horror movie, especially with it being a small found footage film. Deborah Logan as the an old lady with Alzheimer's can really creep under your skin, it genuinely reminded me of The Exorcist. Excellent acting from the mother and daughter main characters. The perfect movie for a good scare. I watched it on Netflix.",1414281600,,347,4.8
6606205,4,B00N1JQ18W,"A solid entry in both the handheld cam and the possession genus. This film also gets points for tackling a truly terrifying subject, namely the devastating effects of alzheimer's disease. By approaching the hand held camera work as an attempt to document the progression of the disease, the viewer is given a plausible explanation as to both why these abnormal behaviors occur, and why the crew and family keep filming even while they suffer the consequences.  Dealing with someone who has dementia makes for a plausible and multifaceted scary situation for everyone involved

The acting is solid, particularly well handled by the mother and daughter.  But the real game changer in the acting department is the camera man who has the unfortunate task of keeping his eyes on the woman transforming into something or someone else before him.  He is both visibly upset and terrified and his cynicism makes him easy to relate to.  He also offers a little comedic relief when he's not scared half to death. His decision to ultimate bail on the project 3/4 of the way through the film feels genuine and helps sell the realism of the whole movie's premise.  Unfortunately, the film also loses some of the realism after he leaves. but considering how well done this whole movie is up until that happens, it's a mistake I'm willing to overlook.

the only real complaint I have is that the scenes at night are a little hard to even see.  Thee gaze of the possessed woman in this picture is far more frightening when they let it linger. The scariest things aren't always in the dark.  This film is certainly worth a rental for any horror movie lover like me.",1414195200,,1647,4.730769230769231
6606206,3,B00N1JQ18W,"This was your typical possession movie with an Alzheimer's twist thrown in. Certainly gave the whole ghost movie a fresh perspective, which isn't easy to do nowadays. It could have been a lot better with a bit more action, and the fake documentary angle is past the point of getting old, but I was pleased with the acting and with the end of the movie. Creative way to wrap everything up. Not a fantastic movie, but The Taking of Deborah Logan is definitely worth renting or watching on Netflix once.",1414195200,,500,4.566666666666666

Certainly not a nuanced art film, but I'll give it credit for what it does right - pacing, reincorporation, and charm. The only thing that really bugged me was some very specific special effects that didn't really cut it on the realism thing, but that was part of what made it so fun. Plot is predictable, but not so predictable it becomes boring. Anyone in the medical field will laugh at the absurd loopholes such as the fact that once someone becomes a threat to themselves and everyone else, they don't get sent home.",1501804800,,614,4.491071428571429
