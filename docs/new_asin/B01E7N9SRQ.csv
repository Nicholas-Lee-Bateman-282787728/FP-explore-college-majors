7732002,2,B01E7N9SRQ,"Interesting concept, but seems to be missing a lot of the exposition one would expect from a movie like this. Could have used some better writing.",1464998400,,146,4.653846153846154

7732005,4,B01E7N9SRQ,"it could have been better, but still good though. kept me entertained the whole time. and once i figured out what was going on, the story was pretty interesting. i actually like it better than the hunger games and the maze. the hunger games was boring, to much filler and romantic stuff. the maze didn't have much of a story to it. this movie was in the game the entire time, it was mysterious and had a good story, now thats exciting.",1479513600,,435,4.317073170731708

7732008,2,B01E7N9SRQ,"Besides being a total copy of the hunger games, I swear I saw this almost identical movie on cable maybe 3-4 yrs ago except I don't remember anything about the hunger game aspects just the group of people with no memory finding themselves in this weird and dangerous building maze, it looked just like this one with all the weird little vents and doors and all the puzzles and death traps in each new room picking off one by one of the group. Also with Different actors and like I said I don't remember anything about the people being slaves or people outside being able to bet and wager on certain players, just like Hunger Games, I def. don't remember Alec Baldwin or Danny Glover, but don't remember it being in Italian either or any other language other then English. But I guess It could have been the Italian TV movie IMBD's trivia facts say Andron was based on, but I doubt that would have been playing on American cable and in English?? It's going to drive me so crazy, cjan ANYONE think of what that movie was, I'd greatly appreciate it!! ... Anyone? Please!",1478131200,,1067,4.476923076923077

The same theme of good guys put into a dangerous maze for the entertainment of the bad guys.

7732030,3,B01E7N9SRQ,"Not as bad as it could have been, but it's just another B-Movie Hunger Games, Cube etc. hybrid.
Well I think it is watchable, Amazon has worse. But then again: Virtually nothing on Amazon Video
is worth $3.99 much less 90 mins of respiration and heartbeat to watch it in. This belongs squarely
in their ""prime"" tier. Again: Not as bad as it could have been, just overpriced..",1466899200,2,375,4.529411764705882
7732031,2,B01E7N9SRQ,"In 2154 we are introduced to ""The Redemption Game""  with 10 contestants with a chance to win "" wealth, fame, and freedom.""  Except they don't know they are contestants. In fact they have no memory, so they don't come out fighting. Adam (Alec Baldwin) ""controls"" the games through computers, CG stuff etc. He answers to Chancellor Gordon (Danny Glover) who used to be the commissioner of Gotham City.

The characters and dialogue were not exciting as we watched what would be a better RPG. It seemed like someone tried to combine Saw, Matrix, Hunger Games, and Maze into the same film....and sometimes less is more.

7732038,1,B01E7N9SRQ,Horrible - an attempt at a rip off of Hunger Games.  Even with some talented actors this is not worth five minutes.,1465689600,,115,4.2272727272727275

7732042,2,B01E7N9SRQ,"The only reason I watched this was because of Leo Howard being in it. He was the only one who was any good in the whole movie. Even Alec Baldwin did a pretty crappy job. The movie is a bad rip-off of the Hunger Games & The Maze Runner. I feel sorry for Leo, Alec, and Danny Glover having to show their faces in this movie.",1465257600,4,322,3.893939393939394

8757954,1,B01E7N9SRQ,"Baldwin and Glover have sunk to new lows agreeing to appear in the likes of this C movie.  It doesn't even qualify as a B for me, I consider it to be that bad.  This is nothing more than horrible actors, and a horrible script tossed in a blender, with Baldwin and Glover cameo appearances added as icing on the cake in an attempt to make the movie more credible, when in reality, it just made them look much worse.  All I can think is their finances must be in serious shape to have accepted something like this.  And it seems like

Do yourself a favor... don't waste your hard earned money, or time you can't get back on this movie.  You'll regret it like I did.",1487548800,6,663,4.181102362204724
8757955,1,B01E7N9SRQ,"Quite possibly the worst movie of 2015.  Take one part old Star Trek plot of death games for bored extra-terrestrials, one part Maze Runner, and one part Hunger Games, and one part high school script writing, and you have everything you need to know about this waste of tame.  Don't be fooled by the Danny Glover/Alec Baldwin lead actor headliners.  Glover couldn't act any more bored with the script if he had to.  Again, a high school thespian could do better than Glover as the dystopian One World ruler.

Oh, look:  10 contestants with blanked memories run through a concrete old factory basement (they call it a maze.)  The rest of the world watches and bets their lives (literally) on the outcome since 99% of the inhabitants of 2154 world are all slaves to the 1%.  The actual characters drawn up have no character, since you don't know who they are, or what their background is, until late into the movies, and by then, the view is so bored they just don't care.  There are no good guys in this movie to cheer for; they're all self-interested or just without any personality.  The male contestants literally push back the women at one point: and tell them: let the men fight.  Which they do: three against 25, and of course they win.

I've seen some trite lines in movies before, but the list of them here would take up a full 10 pages of dialogue, so suffice it to say that it's cringe-worthy.  By the time the movie ends, the popcorn's all eaten, the drink's down to melted ice, and the thrill is gone.  Stay away.",1484179200,4,1524,4.494545454545454
8757956,5,B01E7N9SRQ,I really enjoyed this movie. Lots of action. It was fun kept me entertained. Some likeable people and not likeable people. All in all I would love to see a number two,1483747200,,166,4.21875
