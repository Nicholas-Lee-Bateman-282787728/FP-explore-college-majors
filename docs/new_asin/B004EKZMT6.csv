4337922,5,B004EKZMT6,"I had the good fortune of knowing 1SG David McNerney as a friend. I also have spent time with and gotten to know many of the Soldiers who served with David during the battle where he earned the Medal of Honor, and who were interviewed for this documentary. I have seen this documentary several times and can not say enough good things about it - it is outstanding! It is professionally produced and directed and those 4ID vets who contributed to the documentary are all to be congratulated for sharing in this historic event. If you have any ties to Vietnam or to the 4th Infantry Division, you should definitely buy this DVD. 1SG David McNerney is sorely missed by those of us who knew him - Steadfast and Loyal.",1292112000,7,713,4.492307692307692
4337923,5,B004EKZMT6,"I had the honor and distinct priviledge of meeting and knowing 1st Sergeant McNerney, the hero, whose actions in combat were still talked about in hushed reverence, when I got into the war in August of 1968, little over a year after the desperate battle of the ""Nine Days in May"".  He did not have to go back to Vietnam, but volunteered to go with his ""boys"".  He said he simply couldn't let them go without being there to guide them.  The last time I spoke to Top, was at the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, DC in May of 2010.  He was already going down hill in his battle with lung cancer, but just had to be there with his men to honor those, who never came back.  He still cared more for the well being of his troops, than himself.  That's just the kind of person Top was.  He died just four months after this reunion, but not before attending a dedication of his monument in Crosby, TX.  As he passed in review leaving that ceremony, his men gave him a final salute.  View the images on my website after you have seen the documentary and see if you don't get tears in your eyes and a lump in your throat.  He is truly a great American Hero and simply one the best human beings I have ever known.

God bless you Top.

In a time when the term ""hero"" has been thrown around with some carelessness, this film documents the story of true heroes-men who were terrified and yet went beyond the call of duty for the men of their unit.  The bond shared between these men is as strong as any shared by blood brothers, and the bond with Sgt. McNerney similar to a son's love and admiration of his father.

The story continues on in the unit's defense of FSB29 in two major battles; one which involved hand to hand combat; the other where the units had to escape down a cliff; 3 companies surrounded by one of the toughest regiments in the NVA.  The second battle for FSB29 lasted for four weeks or more; then after that came Operation Wayne Gray and the unit continued to distinguish itself.  For sure the story is a very long one which lasted almost for two years of almost constant battle.  Finally the story is now just starting to come out.

4337946,5,B004EKZMT6,"I bought the ""Honor in the valley of Tears"" DVD because I served in a sister company to the one depicted, in the same general area, and only about 6 months after the action that was the subject of the DVD.  I hoped the DVD would provide an accurate description of that place at that time, and give some insight into life in the Infantry in that environment.

I was not disappointed, and was in fact impressed with the depth and detail of the interviews and the overall accuracy of the depiction.  Since returning from Vietnam in 1968 I have been searching for some way to help those close to me get some kind of accurate description of that experience - without my having to tell the stories myself.  Hollywood (""Platoon,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" just to name a few) has failed miserably in the accuracy department, and has generally denigrated the GIs who were there.  ""We Were Soldiers"" was better, but it was still Hollywood.  ""Honor in the Valley of Tears"" breaks new ground for depth, insight, empathy and accuracy.  It covers most of the experience, from the intensity of battle to the horror of the death of innocents, and it covers it better than any other attempt at journalism about Vietnam that I've ever seen.

I highly recommend ""Honor in the Valley of Tears"" to anyone who wants to better understand combat and its effects on the participants, and I recommend it particularly to any Vietnam vet who wants to help those close to him better understand what it was all about.  My thanks go to the producers for an important job done very well indeed.",1316390400,4,1579,4.610714285714286
4337947,5,B004EKZMT6,"This documentary not only tells the story of A company and it's heroic leader, but also
for many thousands of Viet Nam veterans, it tells the story  that was never told. In many
cases, it validates the lives of these soldiers who did what their country asked of them.
The brotherhood shown is remarkable, but the lasting scars, not just on the bodies, but on
the hearts of these soldiers, are at times, almost unbearable. Those who made this documentary,
will probably be forever scarred as well.
After viewing this film with people who were lucky enough to have not gone through
something like this, some were in shock and disbelief.
I would highly recommend this film to anyone, and especially anyone who knows someone who
has been to war. It may help you understand ex-soldiers, and why they are like they are.",1308700800,4,813,4.685314685314685
4337948,5,B004EKZMT6,"I was lucky enough to see this documentary from the stages of rough cut to final cut and I have to say that one thing that carried through each stage was the powerful bond that Sgt. McNerney (affectionately known as ""Top"") had with his ""band of brothers"" while serving in Vietnam. The story can be understood from the level of experienced front-lines veterans down to young pre-teens who can handle the subject matter.

McNerney and many of the other men who served (many of whom were at the reunion, in the audience with us), as well as some pictures taken at the time.

I've never seen a story of war told so vividly, so raw. Having met some of the soldiers last year and seeing how they are today, then hearing them talk about what they had to do that day, it's hard for me to imagine how hard it was and still is.  It's nice to know their story is being told.

There are so many aspects of the production that make it 1st class; from the in depth, candid interviews with the surviving members of the company, to the video and stills used from personal collections, then the choice of music score (definitely not hit music of that era)which we've all heard before.
I found that understanding the perspectives of the surviving members along with the details of their bonding together to form an outstanding company is what made a company that survived an ordeal of this magnitude.

4337964,5,B004EKZMT6,"I had heard bits and pieces of this day in the valley of tears over the years from a participant, my brother. I think from the different witnesses and personal testimonies this documentary tells a special story, much unlike most stories of men at war and the heros who played a part. This is an uncommon real life story. I always thought my brother was a hero anyway, but now I know the whole story behind his flying cross, and he ranks as high as any hero in this story from my point of view. If anyone wants to understand the real story of Vietnam heros and who the characters are that seem to often be portrayed in hollywood--this video is the real story of unsung heros. All to often men like my brother won't tell such stories unless they are doing it for therapy or are among other soldiers--so I never understood it the way Eric Dow has had a chance to tell it with the actual participants.

The man who lead these men to war--how much larger can a man be who trains them for survival and then requests to go back a third time to Vietnam so he can protect the ones he trained. Truely this man is a great hero and should be remembered for all time. I think if people could have seen these truths in 1968, just maybe all the boys who returned could have been welcomed a heros welcome, instead of the welcome they received coming home. After WWII many movies were made, but Vietnam was the opposite, we avoided talking about it and hollywood thought it was so unpopular they feared making a mistake. Finally, this battle becomes documented history.

Anyway, this is a movie worth seeing if you want to hear the real thing about Vietnam and understand the bond between real men, buy it.",1294704000,5,1689,4.375796178343949

I found them absolutely honorable in their pain, even if it wasn't obvious to them.
