4375787,5,B004HJ0ZS2,"Ashley Rickards is amazing and I need to say no more than the critics of both the New York Observer, Rex Reed and the Huffington Post:

Fly Away is Heartbreaking, if Hallmark-y
Fly Away is a gripping, life-enhancing low-budget little film about the physically and emotionally punishing struggles of a single mother raising an autistic child. The actors are so exemplary that it is difficult to imagine this is not a documentary. They might not be household names, but they will be. Jeanne (played by the excellent Beth Broderick) has sacrificed almost every aspect of her own life, devoting herself to her handicapped daughter, Mandy (the remarkable Ashley Rickards, from the TV show One Tree Hill), who is now 16 and scarcely able to brush her own teeth. Constantly suspended from her school for special needs because she's a danger to herself and the other children, she is also big enough to become a threat to her mother, sometimes shutting down completely but more often flying into howling rages that leave Jeanne covered with bruises. Trying to be a caring parent and still eke out a living working at home on a laptop, which Mandy attacks like a used toy, Jeanne is sometimes relieved of her duties by her ex-husband, Pete, who can't deal with parenting a disabled child at all, and whose visits always end in disaster. Jeanne has had so little time for herself that she hasn't felt the touch of a human hand in years. Along comes Tom (Greg Germann), a new neighbor with a rescue dog who develops a fondness for Jeanne and a special relationship with Mandy, too. Tom is too good to be true, but his attempts to bring love to Jeanne's lonely life are met with a rejection that drives him away. Well-meaning teachers and friends recommend Mandy be institutionalized, but Jeanne adamantly resists any decision that could separate her from the child she loves. The sword has a double edge.

Making an auspicious feature-film debut, triple-threat producer-writer-director Janet Grillo manages the difficult job of taking a wrenching social issue from the pages of real life and turning it into a genuinely likable, often humorous and completely absorbing movie. Still, you get the fits, the screams in the middle of the night, the staccato giggles eating tutti-fruiti cereal (the only food Mandy will touch), the endless battle to balance schooling needs with the medical requirements to keep Mandy alive on a fixed income. With all good intentions, the depression is inevitable. This is no fault of the actors. As the saintly mother, Ms. Broderick is natural as breathing. Mr. Germann is winningly affable, charming and welcome as the kind and generous outsider who offers compassion without condescension. And Ms. Rickards, as the dominating, domineering child, gives a three-dimensional performance that must be experienced to be believed. The way all of these sensitive characters bond is touching and very well written, and the acting is first-rate; Fly Away is a glowing tribute to human survival. Unfortunately, I fear it might be too heartbreaking to generate much interest from a general audience seeking entertainment.

Eventually, life forces Jeanne to confront the problem of how to make the right choices for Mandy's future-to put her away and save both their lives, or hold on and go down the drain together. Sometimes the truest, most affirmative love one person can offer another is letting go. As admirable as it all is, Fly Away still seems like a Movie of the Week, or one of those ""worthy"" specials on Hallmark Hall of Fame, which has dealt with the same issue before. Still, this is a movie worth seeing, if for no other reason than the dramatic intensity Ms. Rickards brings to her character. In a class by herself, she deserves, at the very least, an Oscar nomination. Not since Patty Duke in The Miracle Worker has any actor portrayed a handicapped child (especially one with autism) with the same depth of passion and realism. Her emotional range seems to know no limits. She's more heartbreaking than the movie itself, and that is very high praise indeed.

Fly Away: An Absorbing Film About Autism

Posted: 04/12/11 06:18 PM ET

Many people may want to shy away from seeing this film, but that is exactly why they should see it. What the world needs now, besides love sweet love, is empathy. Too many of us are so caught up in our own needs and desires that we sometimes cannot even see anyone else, let alone sympathize; and that is just one facet of life that is explored with great diligence in Fly Away, an independent narrative feature from writer, producer, and director Janet Grillo.

The best thing a serious, no-nonsense movie can do is give us a glimpse into the world of someone whose experiences are so far away from our own that they are difficult for us to even imagine. Fly Away is an intimate story about a divorced mother with a 16-year-old autistic daughter, and although it is set in a quiet suburban neighborhood, it has -- in its own way -- as many twists and turns as a good thriller. If I may borrow the words of one of its characters, Fly Away ""really knows how to throw a punch.""

What is remarkable about this movie is its pacing. It has a rhythm to it, like a symphony. It's at times loud, soft, beguiling, and boisterous. Its many melodic lines intertwine in almost perfect harmony. I say ""almost"" because, otherwise, the film might have approached being maudlin, and it is anything but that. It is hard, tough, and as we follow Jeanne, the mother played by Beth Broderick, through her suffocating environment, we are able to balance our lives against hers because she is so much like most of us. She is more like a real person than a fictional character, and therefore a rarity in movies nowadays.

Jeanne is multidimensional in a very real, down to earth sense: the many facets of her life converge upon her from all quarters. Besides being the mother of a severely autistic child, a full-time responsibility in itself, she is also trying to run a consulting business of sorts with a less-than-fully-sympathetic partner; she is in a perpetual struggle with the principal of her daughter's ""special"" school; and she must constantly battle with her ex-husband, who cannot handle being with their daughter and so is reluctant to help, even when Jeanne needs him most.

Broderick plays Jeanne with a lost look on her face. She is overwhelmed by her circumstances, but is determined to persevere. One day, when her ex does take Mandy for an afternoon, he advises her to use her free time to get her hair done, as if she doesn't have anything better to do. She goes back into her house, looks appraisingly in the mirror, sees that she is still an attractive woman, but then realizes, sadly, that it doesn't really matter anymore. It is a sublime 30 seconds of acting, the kind of moment sometimes overlooked in films, but striking if noticed.

In stark counterpoint to Jeanne is Mandy, the autistic daughter who is not like most of us. Mandy is played by Ashley Rickards, a young lady who should win an Academy Award for best supporting actress. She is that convincing. Her performance is both frightening and wonderful. Director Grillo lets us take small steps into Mandy's world by juxtaposing scenes of bright color with scenes of dreary darkness. We see Mandy on a sunny morning, drawing with brilliantly colored crayons at the kitchen table, and then we see her in the middle of the night in her darkened bedroom screaming about what a bad person she is. Mandy's life seems to be one of extremes. Her shining exuberance is often a heartbeat away from dark violence. Broderick and Rickards hit all the notes perfectly. Their duet is really something to see.

To complicate the lives of Jeanne and Mandy even more, a new neighbor enters the scene, a man around Jeanne's age who seems almost too good to be true. This intriguing yet suspiciously jolly white knight is played to perfection by Greg Germann, who brings just the right amount of ambiguity to the role (something that Germann is always particularly good at, by the way). We struggle along with Jeanne to try to figure him out while stepping very carefully. At one point Jeanne asks him why he doesn't try to date a woman who is not in her particular situation, and as he stands nonplussed, we -- right in step with her -- wonder what his answer can possibly be.

After many changes in key, when the symphony that is this film comes to a close, we see that Jeanne may be about to face her biggest challenge yet. An ending can be seen as a new beginning, and this film leaves me hoping for a sequel.

Fly Away opens in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, on Friday, April 15. And it will be available on VOD, DVD, and Digital on Tuesday, April 26.",1308441600,2,8937,4.770375161707633
4375788,2,B004HJ0ZS2,"I have a 13-year-old son with autism. My wife and I purchased this film, and we both appreciated the fact that people made a movie like this that tries to realistically capture everyday life with an autism/PDD teen. The film would have fit the bill if it was not for two huge errors about life with autism and what this particular character would say/do. Number one: At one point the character with autism sees two people kissing and then she asks her mom, ""Will I ever get married?"" (or something of the sort). Point-blank: no person with the kind of severe autism depicted in this character would ask such a question. The screenwriter nearly ruined the film by inserting this totally inappropriate sequence that we all WISH were true of the autistic mind. Number two: At the conclusion of the film, the mom brings her daughter to an unrealistic utopia of a special-needs residential placement and school (I've been to many Northern California special needs schools. Maybe down in Beverly Hills they have amazing ones that I've never seen.). The mom and girl have a brief encounter/conversation with an overly idealized special-needs boy, and suddenly the daughter becomes enthused about being in such a place with a potential new friend. Again, this is a dream-wish of the screenwriter, producer, and director to believe that the most difficult decision of a mother's life could be reduced so easily. I am not being cynical here. I really am very disappointed with these two sequences that show a failure on the part of the movie makers to understand the reality of most people living with autism. ""Austism the Musical"" is, in my opinion, a much superior production.",1308009600,18,1668,4.876760563380282
4375789,5,B004HJ0ZS2,"I show this film in my Child Psychology class, primarily to teach the students about working with our clients' parents.  I don't know any other film that so honestly, sensitively, even brutally, shows the difficulties a parent of a special-needs kid goes through.  The acting, particularly of the amazing lead women, is astounding.  The story, script, and direction are sensitive but never sentimental or cloying.  And surprisingly often funny.  The movie's honesty creates terrific debates in my class - those who relate to the mother throughout and those who find her wrong too often.  ""Fly Away"" does not tell you which of these is true - though it's hard to believe anyone won't fall in love with Jeanne, Mandy, and Tom, in all their beautiful imperfections.  I have yet to see anyone not love this undeservedly-little-known gem of a film.",1306800000,2,843,4.978571428571429

I sort of expected one of those Lifetime ""Heroic Mom withstands dire circumstances and in the end her Love Conquers All"" things.  You know, where the disabled child is nothing more than a way for the scriptwriter to illustrate how great Mom is?

Not so.  The girl who played the autistic daughter (the actress is not autistic) wasn't just a collection of tics and screams:  she was a complex person, and we got to see her that way.  Really well done!",1301529600,13,626,4.535714285714286

The movie was interesting and kept me engage. The only issue is just some of the scenes didn't always make 100% sense. That's the way many movies are though.

The performances are incredibly believable, the storyline is LIFE, and although life doesn't always have the story-book, happy ending, it does always end with a breath.  So does ""Fly Away"".

4375808,4,B004HJ0ZS2,"This was in fact an entertaining film, but as the mother of an Autistic child, this is not quite realalistic. There was a time when people felt it necessary to interject their views constantly out in public but I do not see that anymore.  I really only see it amonst the family members.  In public I see people trying to be supportive even though they may say the wrong thing. As far as a single parent with an Autistic child, I cannot speak on their behalf as I do have a loving supportive husband that has never once considered leaving me and I do feel blessed for that.  I still gave it four stars though because there is accuracy in many ways.  Autistc children require things to be a certain way and they are very literal.  You cannot promise them something and then not give it to them if they did not accomplish their duty to your specifications.  It is best not to promise them anything but waite and reward them when they have accomplished something.  Also many Autistic children do scream out in the night. Some do not sleep at all.  Many are aggressive and it is very very hard on the parents and I could only imagine what it would be like for the single parent.  So yes, this movie had some very accurate moments just not completely accurate moments.  Oh and I don't think I would be looking to get married again if my husband were to leave me or die either.  My son is very hard to love.  It takes someone very special to understand him and I would fear that no one could understand him like his father and I do.  So yes, I am sure many single mothers feel their life is about their children",1349740800,2,1604,4.289036544850498

This rare and refreshingly real film presents the stalwart commitment and precarious delicacy requisite to deep, personal relationships. Set in a wildly unfamiliar landscape where the psyches of a dedicated mother and her autistic daughter overlap, we are challenged to take a hard look at love's position on the scale of holding on and letting go. As with all great stories, Fly Away finds genuine and credible ways to navigate the cusp between the miraculous and the mundane. With its uncompromising fidelity to the challenges of raising an autistic child, Fly Away delivers experiences starkly authentic to life. Carefully weaving sorrow and joy into a quiet plot with a voluminous interior, there is nothing excessive or contrived in this complex, psychologically active, yet grounded film. In short, the story carries the grit of life with the kind of hard-earned gracefulness that comes with bearing the weight of honesty and integrity.

What Grillo has done here is simply shared her world, aided by strong performances from the cast. Watch this film to experience the story of a mother, like any other good mother, who is afraid of letting go of her daughter, even though that is exactly what is needed for both of them to transform out of the chrysalis that has been their shared, isolated life.

8429577,1,B004HJ0ZS2,"Worst movie ever! its a mystery how this received any ratings above 1 star. Rushed, poorly written, poorly directed and done.
Humor-filled movie - Didnt laugh even once while watching this film.
Powerful film - What redeeming value is to come from watching this film?

1. Not very realistic portrayal of autism. the protanigist Mandy, most of what she does is scream, jump and flap alot, no obvious or believable reasons why. For instance, she unreasonably meltdowns, flaps, screams and acts out when nothing's happened at all, leaving the viewer in the clouds wondering why shes behaving the way she is. During a visit to her friends house, Mandy begun hopping up and down, saying ""ice cream!"" over and over again and for no reason she starts screaming and wiggles her arms everywhere, mum has to stop her. Not very believable at all! Also very constant and incessant. It shouldve been more realistic like when she's in somewhere stressful and loud or she isn't getting things her way and it makes her upset!

2. Mandy is a BOYS name, why couldn't they choose something else? like emily, Lena, christina, etc... there are better names for little girls as opposed to Mandy

3. Very tedious activity (not much going on) in the neighborhood... the lack of action is both a good and bad thing. Its good this film isn't EXTREMELY fast-paced and over dramatized like most American dramas, but the lack of activity and focusing on Mandys mother talking to the principal instead of seeing Mandy in a typical school day, makes for a very boring tedious film to watch. Colours and lighting not super good (more dull than certain old drama shows), places get repetitive and visited too much

4. The predictable and rowdy discussions. At one point early in film, the principal talks to Mandys mum and says ""shes gonna grow out of the system, you except her to sprout WINGS?"" and mum answers ""she needs time to adapt to the environment, its what kids on the spectrum do!"" also the principal says ""she threw a desk and hit another child"" and its very dull info-dumping talks, not far from what

5. Mandy does few things in this movie. Its nice and understandable to see her eating tutti-frutti cereal whilst watching old black-and-white Disney films like a little kid spending the night out at the Movie Theater and eating popcorn, but this is done so much in this film that we barely see Mandy doing anything else. The other things she does is scream, physically attack others when feeling that shes in danger, visiting 2 restaurants and even wanders away near the end of the movie.

6. A daughter with such a severity of autism shouldnt be in even a special education school but be homeschooled... for a daughter who is able to speak but cannot brush her teeth (Wouldnt Mandys inability to brush her own teeth significantly affect the oral muscles in her tongue and mouth, rendering her unable to speak?)

7. Very one-sided, dark-focused, fictionally depicted and unexciting. Yes, I understand you cannot have an autism film/series without the hard things in life, but just... oh my god. The only precious moments are the ending credits, the title screen with the ladybug music box, and when Mandys parents are singing joyful little nursery rhymes (like Ladybug, Ladybug, Fly Away Home) to soothe her soul in times of upset. I expected this movie to not be another generic autism movie but very tedious and predictable, obvious yet impractical. Well keep going if you're interested but that nails it BUT

8. ""Okay, bud! Here is our schedule for the day."" Hmm, you don't show anybody a schedule with those words on the couch, best to choose a nicely-detailed illustrated schedule with color pictures, hang it up on the wall and/or tape it to a surface! Its like mum has recently begun to use schedules for her 16 YEAR OLD autistic daughter and hasn't done it since she was little. That was bad enough, but wait til you hear this: mum touches down on Mandys chin, forcing her to see it. Not a very good idea! In fact, touching is a trigger for many autistic people and can make them scared or even aggressive (though it depends on the person, some autistics actually enjoy being hugged, touched, and cuddled!). Also, the schedule is a white dull sheet of paper that looks rather blank, so Mandy looks away.

9. The colors and lighting again! For such a green peaceful suburb, theres almost if not no flowers at all, not even white coloured flowers in the outdoors, no dandelions, daisies, poppies, petunias, marigolds or carnations. Inside of Mandys special school, since we don't see Mandy inside (except for the PT room meltdown scenario), during her mums visits to the principal, we ca see that inside of Mandys school, it is poorly decorated and hasn't even any decent decor on the walls, aside from brightly-coloured yet bland-looking schedules and calendars on the walls. In other words, dull dcor makes for a dull film.

10. As Ive mentioned before, we never see Mandy in a typical special school day! The only time we get to see Mandy in school is where she has an unhappy time in what one of her therapists (or someone else) called the OT room while her mum spoke with the principal. The therapist shouldve nicknamed it The Activity Room or The Play Room because unless Mandy previously has had an appointment scheduled with her therapist, its pretty much like a reward rather than therapy, think of Mandy playing at a McDonalds play-pit while her. If you wondered what had happened that rather unfortunate time, let me explain:

11. More about the OT Room: As a matter of fact (or should I say, opinion), the OT Room actually has fair if not decent decoration in there, (even for a low-budget film with poor lighting)! Some nice bright colors here and there, some toys for paitients to play with, fairly designed. However, take a look the equipment! A yellow peanut-shaped exercise ball, a rope and wood ladder placed on the wall, and a medium-sized ball pit filled with colourful plastic spheres all of which sizes and capacity are suited towards a younger audience (toddlers and primary-school aged children) and not specially designed for teenagers nor adults with special needs. Mandy looks overgrown for the exercise ball (she could pop it whilst sitting on it) and tear the ladder off the wall whilst climbing it. That does NOT help!
12. Hmm, Im feeling like taking a trip to NYC right now, Ive got a Broadway concert to see! Well, not so after all.  Itd be fascinating to watch Mandy and her mum take a nice visit at LA city in fact, they do! Mum is told by a close neighbour (or somebody) Mum, I have bad news to tell you! I think your sweet daughter Mandy has just wandered off the streets, youve OUGHT to catch her ASAP! Thankfully Mandy arrives home safely without serious injury or death, but oh Lord, how scary that mustve been! Although it is now proven that over 60% of autistic children wander away from home long enough for parents to contact authorities, and there are horrific stories of autistic children struck by cars and the like, if parents keep a close eye on their children amongst other things, autistic children and their parents can have a nice time in the city.
13. The directors and the actress Ashely Rickards have both done a poor job displaying symptoms and characteristics of autistic spectrum disorder. For instance, Mandys condition looks more like ADHD with Conduct Disorder and PTSD in my opinion. Mandy acts very hyperactive, incessantly jumping like a kangaroo, her hands clutched together with fingers like that of a crippled elderly woman! For a low-functioning severely affected pre-adult whos unable to brush her teeth, she has deleted saved work files from her moms laptop, we never get to see Mandy draw anything but as a birthday present she receives a pen and paper (some rather cheap simplistic gifts) and even asks her mum if shell ever get married when she looks out the car window, passing by two couples kissing. No way on earth could a daughter so highly impacted by autism be able to ask her mum such a question. At the end of the movie, Mandy is suddenly transferred into a special-needs care home to live with other adults, where outside Mandy and her mum meet an overly idealistic teenage boy. Afterwards, Mandy says with all, all my heart! and signs a heart on her chest to her mum as a different way of saying I love you. Sweet, huh? But very unrealistic for such a character affected by severe autism. Then the credits finally roll in, with a white plane in the blue sky.
14. More about Ashely Richards: she does NOT have autism, though Im not against healthy actors/actresses playing in dramas/films as autistics/special needs people as long as its believable, sincere, realistic and enlightening. However, according to Wikipedia she DID have some connection as a child. Ashely grew up in a horse farm for special needs children in Sarasota, Florida, USA.

15. That pretty much sums it up. Bad directing, poor music and camera, lack of music, poor, unrealistic portrayal of autism, lack of plot and purpose, bad decor, etc.

16. that's pretty much it. You should be ashamed if you gave this movie a positive rating :( very poor and just another generic autism film.

Thankfully I've watched it... for free! But it isn't worth free either.

Thank you.",1478649600,,9310,4.7447466007416566
8429578,5,B004HJ0ZS2,A very accurate depiction of life for families which include autistic members.  Ashley Rickards does an incredible job of portraying a 15 year old girl who deals with Autism.  She was younger when the film was made - and is 23 now - but is a FINE actress.,1477526400,,255,4.291666666666667

8429580,4,B004HJ0ZS2,"Thoroughly enjoyed it! As a parent of an autistic son, there was so much I could relate to in this film. This movie depicts the true challenges and joys that come with being a caretaker/parent of someone on the spectrum. Yes, there were difficult moments to watch, but also those that were inspiring and enlightening. Good writing, superb acting and a true depiction of what it means to love unconditionally.",1470787200,2,408,4.8428571428571425

8429582,4,B004HJ0ZS2,"I had to watch this movie for a college class.  It was very interesting, but was kind of a short movie and did not complete the entire story.  It is good for someone who wants to get a better understanding of Autism and what parents go through, especially when considering a residential placement.",1468540800,,297,4.584905660377358
8429583,5,B004HJ0ZS2,"I have high functioning autism, among other things, and this is so scary as it is very realistic. From how the meltdowns are shown to the every day struggles, whomever did the research for this movie did exceptionally well. It broke my heart seeing how much the mom struggled with decisions with what was best for her daughter and herself as I know my parents went through that as well.
This is a must see for all those wanting to know more about autism and the challenges, rewards, weaknesses and strength it takes for all involved to deal with it.",1465257600,,549,4.5
