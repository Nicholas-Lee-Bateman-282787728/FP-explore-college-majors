If you haven't seen the show or maybe even a couple of the comics prior to getting the DVDs like I was, be prepared for the unexpected in this set of the adventures of the turtles in the new generation.  Some things that happened I never seen coming even for a animated show of its time, while at the same time some of the elements are borrowed from the movie then again the tables get turned in reverse almost.  When you think that things had come to an end, the way that Season 1 ends, will leave you a little confused as to what's going to happen when the next season starts.  Overall I give this set 4.5 stars out of 5.",1279756800,,769,4.072847682119205
2909317,4,B000TSMODE,"The Original TMNT are back!

  I was always a fan of TMNT ever since,  back in the 1980's,  I ask the young Army Lieutenant why the ""heck""  he  had turtles with Martial Art's weapons on his desk? The Lieutenant stammered that he had been roommates or friends, can't remember which, with the cartoon's creator in college. Little did he know that I worked for a SiFi Game Company on the side or that I was close friends with the then editor of, ""Dragon Magazine"". I was mildly interested, so I looked into the ""underground"" comic that featured TMNT and fell in love with it. The deeper than normal comic book story line and edgier banter were what I think grabbed my attention.

 Jump forward a few years to the original  TV cartoon. A big disappointment in my eyes.  The animation was far too commercial, or what Jack Kirby would call, ""industrial"", the banter was not edgy and the dialogue was abysmal and pizza obsessed.

 Jump forward again, 2009. Kids and Grandson are up for the 4th of July. Grandson is in love with, (don't get ahead of me here), you guessed it, TMNT. As I tried to run herd on a way too energetic 4 year old one night, I asked him if he wanted to watch cartoons. Of course he came bouncing up with TMNT. I sigh and say, ""O.K., we'll watch these"", as I reluctantly fire up the DVD Player.

 Much to my surprise this was not the original cartoon. The stories are much better, the animation is border line Aname and rather well done. Granted that the plots are not quit as gritty as the original comic's, (but only slightly dumbed down for young kids), but they are 100 times better than the original cartoons. I ended up watching the whole set of DVD's long after the little tike had fallen asleep.

 All & all highly recommended if you were a fan of the original comics. If You were a fan to the original cartoons, go rent one of each and watch them one after the other. I think that you will find that this is the better of the two. I also thought that the  superior tribute to comic legend Jack Kirby was a very nice touch.

2909318,5,B000TSMODE,"The episodes in this set comprise a story arc that was a trill to watch. If you like Ninja Turtles, you will like this set. If you have never heard of them before, this would be a great intro.
The only part of this set that is not 5 star worthy is ""Notes from the Underground."" It is entertaining, but the weakest episodes in this set.

2909319,5,B000TSMODE,"The 2nd part of the first season, they finally decided to cram more episodes & in order with these sets.  I have all of them so far & of course i think this is one of the best part of the season yet. Part 2 of 2 continued on from:

The turtles will no longer fear the Shredder as a threat, they finally realize they can defeat him & while they're not masters yet they definatly show no mercy for Shredder.  Unlike the 'original tmnt' series like:

This series is more action-filled & more storyboarded with tons of cliffhangers i would think that comic-fans & true TMNT fans will love this dvd.  As well as others make sure you check out:

2909321,5,B000TSMODE,"This set contains a strong batch of episodes from the latter half of season 1 of the new TMNT series. Mirroring a story arc from the comics and the 1990 movie, the Shredder attacks the Turtles, forcing them to regroup at Casey's farmhouse before returning to New York for the final showdown (or so they think). Afterwards they must find Splinter, abducted by the same aliens responsible for the Turtles' origin! Elsewhere the Turtles find monsters in an underground Foot genetics lab, and there is a nice tribute episode to comic legend Jack Kirby.

Again no bonus features, which is disappointing. However the episodes are good, and the price is relatively cheap for the amount of content. I agree it's annoying to still have the TV-Y7 tags at the beginning, hopefully 4Kids will get rid of them next time. I haven't had any disc errors on my copy, and hopefully you won't either.

2909371,5,B000TSMODE,"See the full review at Metal Arcade .Net

Nickelodeon's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series has quickly become a huge success. It debuted in September of 2012 and has already been renewed for a second and third season, before its first season has even finished airing. This is hardly surprising, since Nick revealed in a press release that the series premiere garnered more viewers than any of their shows had since 2009 (12 million). I've got to say I'm quite happy for the series and the network, as TMNT is a fantastic show that deserves recognition. Following up on their release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Rise Of The Turtles (review here), Nick has released Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Enter Shredder, another very solid collection of episodes.

The seven episodes included on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Enter Shredder are all varied and quite entertaining. The show does a great job of juggling humor, action, and storytelling, while focusing on only one or two characters per episode. ""Never Say Xever"" focuses on the trials and tribulations of leadership, as well as the idea of showing mercy on defeated opponents. It features some great combat sequences, which are fluidly animated and well-choreographed - and best of all, the Turtles aren't afraid to use their weapons.

In ""The Gauntlet"", Shredder finally goes toe-to-toe with the Turtles, who up to that point had become a bit overconfident in their abilities. Facing Shredder definitely gives them some perspective, and this episode really ups the drama as now the Turtles' most fearsome enemy knows where they live. I'm really happy that the show's creators have stayed true to the classic look of Shredder, and Kevin Michael Richardson absolutely nails the voice. The Turtles' battles with Shredder are definitely among the best the show has had to offer thus far.

Another really strong episode is ""New Girl in Town"", featuring Shredder's daughter Karai. Her rebellious, fun-loving attitude was a great mirror to Leonardo's sternness and sense of duty, and the playful banter between them was entertaining. Leo seems to think there's some good inside her, and she does save his life a few times, so it'll be interesting to see how this arc plays out. She could easily be luring him into a trap, or maybe she simply likes toying with him.

Similar to Nick's new Avatar series The Legend Of Korra (I'm currently watching the Book One: Air Blu Ray and will have a review up soon), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an excellent show that people of all ages can enjoy. There's plenty of juvenile humor, but there's also plenty of great character development, dialogue, and truly kick-ass action sequences. Every episode even has a strong moral to the story with some sage advice from the wise Master Splinter. Overall, this is an extremely entertaining series for old-school Turtles fans and newcomers alike, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Enter Shredder is another solid collection of episodes.",1375056000,,2972,5.057142857142857
2909372,1,B000TSMODE,"Recently my son has become interested in all things ninja turtle, so we purchased most of the classic episodes and movies as well as the new nickelodeon incarnation for him.  The new episodes look cheap, and the stories I have seen lack feeling somewhat detached from the original series.",1374710400,,288,4.877551020408164
2909373,5,B000TSMODE,"I was born in 1981, which means that I grew up on the original TMNT series. I had--okay, I still have--a collection of TMNT memorabilia, all of the movies, all kinds of stuff. I've seen these characters through countless rebirths, whether it was one of the many cartoon series, the comics from Mirage, Archie, or Image. Whenever there's a remake, the fans of the original will be hesitant to buy into the new version. I was especially doubtful when it came to the casting of the voice talent.

I'm a big fan of Greg Cipes, and of course Rob Paulsen played our beloved Raphael in the original series. However, I think that the current cast could not possibly be any better. I loved the original cast, of course, but something about this current cast feels more close to the comics. I also think that Rob's voice fits better with Donatello.

This series, while indulging in small amounts of silliness, plays them out as characters instead of caricatures. Each one has his or her light and dark sides. I also enjoy seeing April getting to learn to be a ninja like she did in the comics instead of a helpless reporter. It's also nice to see her as a teenager in this series. It just adds a new dynamic to the story.

It also doesn't hurt that there are a lot of little references to the old series, to the comics, and subtle shout-outs to the fans of the classic versions. I think that if you approach this new series with an open mind and a love of all things TMNT, you will fall in love just as I have.

Besides, fans of TMNT should be excited about introducing a whole new generation to the characters we know and love.",1373760000,4,1618,4.40133779264214
2909374,5,B000TSMODE,"I admit I loved the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles back when they first came out and even though today's turtles are animated a little different, I love that I can introduce my kids to them.  The TMNT are a great group of friends, yes their turtles, who are constantly battling bad guys and saving the world!  They work together, make us laugh and act responsibly with their weapons by training.  This DVD features eight episodes including Shredder himself!  Really what the TMNT without Shredder?  My boys (5 and 6 years old) enjoy this DVD and like to of course pretend they are ninja turtles.  Yes there is fighting and weapons but it not blood and gore, and its a Nickelodeon show meant for kids (and of course adult fans.)  If you are worried though you can catch the show on Nickelodeon to see if its appropriate for your child before buying this DVD.  My boys love that they can have a TMNT marathon or just watch 1-2 episodes.

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1373673600,,1006,4.513812154696133
2909375,5,B000TSMODE,"This week Nickelodeon released the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Enter Shredder on DVD, containing the episodes 8-13 from the first season of 2012 series with all-star voice cast of Jason Biggs, Sean Astin, Greg Cipes, Mae Whitman, Hoon Lee, and Rob Paulsen - the original voice the 1987's Raphael, but now he is voicing the new Donatello.

Enter Shredder is the second DVD release from the first season containing eight episodes on a single disc.

The episodes are:

Monkey Brains

Never Say Xever

The Gauntlet

Panic in the Sewers

Mousers Attack!

It Came From The Depths

New Girl in Town

Special Features are:

Animated Comic Books:

""Tales From The Lair, Part One""

""Tales From The Lair, Part Two""

The Mutation Scene

Full Screen Format

Dolby Digital:

English 5.1 Surround

Spanish Stero

French Stero

Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo continue their quest to find their new sixteen-year-old human friend's, April O'Neil, scientist father, Dr. Kirby O'Neil, who has been kidnapped by the brain-shaped aliens in robotic suits, known as the Kraang. While their master Splinter isn't training them in the sewers (where they live), they are battling the Purple Dragon, the crazy Baxter Stockman, mousers, other mutants, and the Shredder, whom the turtles finally meet and lets just say it isn't a Kodak moment. Their only new ally is an oversize mutant alligator named Leatherhead.

After two cartoon series, a live-action series, four movies (soon to be five), countless comic books (which the franchise is based on) and toys, you would think the franchise would become repetitive. Surprisingly, the third series is a refreshing take on the turtles, using CGI animation (which I'm normally against), well-written scripts, and a talented voice cast.

There seems to be some confusion among fans about a missing episode ""I, Monster"" from this release. The DVDs are going by the original production order, aka - the order the episodes were made. ""I, Monster"" was the 13th episode aired, but it was the 14th episode made, therefore it will appear on the two-disc ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Ultimate-Showdown/dp/B00DTRR3XS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Ultimate Showdown</a>"" coming to DVD this October.

I know there are many haters for any type of reboot, where some say ""They destroyed my childhood."" I guess people don't like change, and they like to compare anything to the original. I have to admit I shared the exact same thoughts when I first watched the new series, but I was a fan after the end of the first episode. The episodes on Enter Shredder are action-packed with humor that both children and adults will enjoy. Overall, Enter Shredder is a great addiction to the TMNT franchise.

2909376,2,B000TSMODE,"I picked the New DVD up today Season 1 Pt. 2 Enter Shredder for my sons.

Well nothing new here, This is just another case of Turtle fans being treated as second class viewers.

The episodes are; 7-12,14.  Episode 13 ""I monster"" is not included, once again leaving the fan base scratching it's heads, why must we always chase correct in order releases.

Seriously the Orig. show had out of sequenced episodes only to be corrected w/ the final season 10 release. The 2k3 seasons had out of Sequenced episodes, and the Trend continues w/ the 2012 series.

The question is how long are we suppose to put up with this disrespect of such a large numbered fan base?  Will this animated series ever be treated w/ respect and us the fan base be treated the same, once again we are getting non Season Releases, being forced to buy partial episodes....what are we going to see a one release full season DVD issued later only after we bought this piece meal set and still have missing episodes?

Other then the missing episode and the fact this season is not all being released as One DVD set, the show is great.  NIck and Paramount are just pulling the same ol ploy taking our money w/ out a whole lot in return!",1373328000,3,1202,4.431818181818182
2909377,3,B000TSMODE,"I'm a newly converted fan of this series, having grown up on the 1987 animated show and, to a lesser extent, the live action movies.  This new series really started strong with the first six episodes (collected on ""Rise of the Turtles"") and continues to impress with ""Enter the Shredder"", which serves up the next seven episodes from the first season.  I received an advance copy of this disc for screening purposes for the site I write for (linked below), so this short review is from the perspective of someone who actually owns the disc.  Novel idea, right?

First, the good: The A/V presentation is still solid for standard definition DVD (including 16x9 widescreen, which the packaging lists as ""full screen"" again), and obviously the episodes are well above average.  ""The Gauntlet"" is an easy standout with the Turtles' first Shredder fight, and the introduction and/or continued appearance of characters like Baxter Stockman, Leatherhead and Karai is a nice touch.  The stakes always seem pretty high and, luckily enough, the good guys don't always win easily so it keeps things interesting.

The bad is more objective, unfortunately.  One episode (""I, Monster"", featuring the Rat King) is not here, as it would normally air between ""It Came from the Sewers"" and ""New Girl in Town"".  Whether this was simply an oversight or a decision to present them in a different order is unknown, but it's definitely odd.  The bonus features are fairly weak, consisting of a short digital comic book and one group of storyboard comparisons.  The last two complaints are regarding (1) Nickelodeon's decision to continue with this one-disc ""volume"" nonsense instead of just waiting for a full season collection and (2) the continued lack of a Blu-ray option.  With any luck, these last two problems will be corrected in the coming months.

Anyway, bottom line: this is still a fun disc and worth watching, but it may be redundant if and when a full season set arrives.  Until then, you're probably best just renting or borrowing it.

2909378,4,B000TSMODE,"I'm a long time turtles fan, originally discovering their wonderful comic book series in an article from some random martial arts magazine way back around 1986. That being said, I've seen several iterations of these characters throughout the ages & this new TMNT cartoon is awesome & far better than the 1st animated series from the late 80's. With an exception to the 1st season from 1987, the rest of that now ""classic"" show is a true test in human endurance. Fan or not. This recent outing from Nickelodeon continues in the tradition of Fox's edgy 2003 series with obvious nods to the early comics, movies, & the original cartoon. This is clearly an innovative re-imagining that successfully captures all the best era's of these long running characters in stunning, cutting edge cg animation. My only gripe with these DVD releases is they should have more episodes on them but luckily as on the 1st release we get some nifty ""making of a scene"" animatics which are really cool to watch & then seeing the final cut as it appears on the episode. Plus the animated comic book feature is a nice touch. Hopefully though in the future they'll decide to add other cool special features like more behind the scenes stuff or even commentary by cast & crew. Another nod I'll definitely give Nickelodeon is their really top notch design & packaging work on these DVD's with crisp & tight colorful art. I'm a huge fan of the TMNT 2K series but again, this show is a much welcome follow up to that amazing show & highly recommended to animation, art, movie, & comic book fans alike.",1371772800,2,1572,4.658273381294964

2909380,1,B000TSMODE,"I was aprehensive at first growing up with the amazing 87' turtles as I was with the 2k3 series. Which might I add exceeded all expectations. This show looked very cheap. Changed weapons crappy animation, it just looked like nickelodeon just trying to make money like they have when they ruined so many other classic cartoons. I would give this product 0 stars if possible. I gave it a chance to be unbiased and sadly my suspicions came true. This is a disgrace to the franchise I can't believe Kevin Eastman or Peter Liard would ever allow this to happy. Terrible animation, dialog seems like it's written by a monkey, extremely corny, and the story line could not be worse. If you grew up with the classic turtles and don't want your heart ripped out from your chest I'd suggest never buying this product; or rather buying this product in bulk and destroying it so less people must watch it.",1370908800,,893,4.5875
2909381,5,B000TSMODE,"I'll begin by saying that I was wrong. I'm of the generation that lived and breathed the 1987 Ninja Turtles. I first saw the trailer for this cartoon and thought it was a cheap CGI ripoff of the franchise.

But then I watched the first episode and fell in love all over again. It made me feel the way I did all those years ago growing up with the Turtles. Except, unlike the 1987 cartoon, which hasn't aged well, this show looks and feels fresh. The 87 cartoon was corny and the animation was often inconsistent at best. By contrast, the writing for this series is actually pretty decent for a cartoon. Each episode is self-contained, but I like how the build upon a larger story with some continuous characters and elements. The action is well paced but also allows time for character moments. Best of all, the show is genuinely funny. Not goofy, corny, ""I can't believe I'm watching this"" funny, but some real ""laugh out load"" moments.

I think this show has potential to revive the Ninja Turtles franchise. I dare say it might even be better than the 1987 series in some ways. Definitely recommended.",1370563200,29,1103,4.565656565656566
2909382,5,B000TSMODE,"I watched the original series and liked it!
Back in January of 2004, I was at a Target store and sall the original TMNT movies
for sale in a DVD three-pack! Then I sall the new series on DVD, and I figured
that I'll give it a shot and see if I like it! I bought 'Attack Of The Mousers',
'The Shredder Strikes Back' and 'Return To New York' (as well as the three movies, lol)!
And when I watched the new series... I loved it!
Then a few months ago I sall that they released this DVD with all my favorite episodes on it!
So I quickly bought it here on Amazon.com!
I love it so much!
As for the product description:
It contains my eight favorites;
1. The King
2. The Shredder Strikes pt. 1
3. The Shredder Strikes pt. 2
4. Tales Of Leo
5. Monster Hunter
6. Return To New York pt. 1
7. Return To New York pt. 2
and...
8. Return To New York pt. 3

These are my all time favorite TMNT episodes!
They were true the the comic origins and were very fun to watch!
The other six episodes (Notes From Underground and The Search For Splinter)
were good episodes but I like the top eight most!
The cover to the DVD box was awesome!
I highly recommend this DVD set to any and all TMNT fans!
I hope they make a series of live action movies based on these episodes,
some day,... in the not too distant future:)!!
