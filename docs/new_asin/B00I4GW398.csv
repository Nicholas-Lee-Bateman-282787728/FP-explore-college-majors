8639263,5,B00I4GW398,We have watched this series for a long time. Found this and really enjoyed the background to the stories. Several parts we had no clue of why they did certain things in the show. It was also great to see the characters grow and change or the ten or so years of the series. Wish it continued!,1462838400,,291,4.12280701754386
