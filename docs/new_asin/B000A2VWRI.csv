It begins with a rider being chased by five others. There is shooting. The lone man rides down a steep hill. He removes his saddle and hides in a ranch. The five search the ranch. The Sheriff questions the people there. The sought outlaw appears in the barn when offered coffee. Jim Smith drinks it and talks. He is offered a job as a cow hand. There is a $1,000 reward for the Oklahoma Cyclone. Smith is told to leave Carmelita alone. Smith sings and plays the guitar. Carmelita asks for a song. Then Carmelita sings. Jim has been meeting Carmelita secretly. Out on the range Jim plays a harmonica. Rawhide picks a fight with Jim and loses. There is a party for Carmelitas birthday. Jim does not attend in case he might be recognized by the guests.

Slim advises Jim about Rawhides actions; be careful. Slim will be leaving. Its time to change pastures. Jim talks about his past, he is overheard by Carmelita. The foreman orders the men on a job. Jim visits Carmelita to say goodbye. There is a place across the border. Five men enter and take over the place. They go upstairs to talk to a wounded lawman, then back down for a celebration. Jim goes back upstairs to talk to Henderson and explain his past! But he is caught by the Black Diablo. There is a fight. Slim helps Jim. Then there are shots! Slim is wounded and falls. The law arrives to capture the gang. And so it ends.

The movie seems to have been edited and other scenes removed. The ending seems shortened. It is an interesting story about an undercover operation but this is only revealed in the last minutes. This is an early Bob Steele movie, the later ones are better. This story of an undercover operation was repeated in other Western movies; its the obverse of the story or a respected citizen who is the secret head of an outlaw gang.",1510012800,,1840,4.454005934718101
