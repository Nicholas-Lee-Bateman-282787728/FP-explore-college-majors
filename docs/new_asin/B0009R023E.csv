8065435,5,B0009R023E,"I watched the ""I Wrote That!"" DVDs with my two sons, age 6 and 4 and we had a great time. The skits are wonderful because they are created from a story written and sent in by a child. Additionally, they have all the dramatics that kids love; quirky things that just crack them up over and over. They watched the DVDs all the way through, then went back to the parts that they loved the best. Veruka's Lucky Day was the big winner and Monster Milk came in as a close second. It is obvious that these DVDs were such a big hit with the kids because of the creativity that went into everything from the costumes and props to the story itself. If it comes from a kid, it can't get any more creative than that. There was a pleasant lack of ""manufactured-ness"" about the whole thing, which is especially important for kids in a world overwhelmed by technology and premade everything. It was fun and inspiring!",1121126400,,902,4.34319526627219
8065436,5,B0009R023E,"A very fun video duo - the I Wrote That crew delivers a creative approach to bringing a child's idea to life.  The original songs are as catchy as the Silly Songs from the Veggie Tales and the short clever skits are perfect to hold a toddler's attention through the entire video.  For older children, it inspires creativity and self espression.  Also very tolerable for moms to endure the repeated play (my son insisted this was the only video he wanted to watch for a week).  Would love to see more episodes of these!!",1119657600,,519,4.48936170212766
