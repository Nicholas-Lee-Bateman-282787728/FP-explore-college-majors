727423,3,6303686826,"A rare throw-away role for Beatty in this 70s caper that's never dull but is certainly too long.  The methodical build-up to the bank heist  seems to go on forever and you may lose patience by the time you get to some good action stuff towards the end.  Good location settings and Warren's cool here, but it's hard to believe Goldie Hawn's shtick ever found favor with audiences. She's an idiot, childlike prostitute who's supossed to be adorable?  The fact that the actress is a deft player makes it all the more depressing.

And am I missing something?  Entertainment Weekly dubbed this a box office dud, but I seem to remember it having been fairly popular when I was a kid -- it was certainly a big deal when it debuted on TV.",1224374400,,730,4.451127819548872

Very strong performances by Beatty and Hawn plus an engaging soundtrack lift this hyperactive, semi-farce about international banking. They'll only rob from the rich...and give to themselves.
Beatty is a Bank Security Officer who can't stop muttering to himself no matter who is in earshot and Hawn is effective as a free-lance ""Escort"" who is a bit insecure in her new role as co-conspirator; she is a few years past her Laugh-In looniness and has come up with an interesting character.
This movie has traveled through the decades in a low-profile manner, which is surprising considering the successful careers of the two stars, plus Director Richard Brooks, and, of course, Quincy Jones.
The finale has some funky action on a frozen waterway, though the plot line has a certain stumbling forward momentum, nicely underscored in the early scenes by two Little Richard songs recorded in 1971 for this enterprise, ""Money Is"" (would have made a great movie title - seems that the powers-that-be have never decided if it's ""Dollars"", ""The Heist"", or ""$$$""), and a risque rocker called ""Do It - To It"", both uptempo.
Richard fans, get this: these are *movie versions*, if you check out your well-worn vinyl, or the tracks revived on a 3-CD set of LR's Reprise sessions, released on Rhino Handmade.",1206748800,3,1329,5.013574660633484
727425,5,6303686826,"Filmed on location in Hamburg and other northern Europe settings around 1970, Dollars has a great look to it, the story is tight and plausible and the casting is great. The opening is a little confusing as the interweaving storyline is set in motion but it all comes together beautifully a third of the way into the action. There is so much going on in Dollars that multiple viewings will be rewarded, and the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard, especially if you like jazz, and is well matched to the action. Watching these veteran actors do their thing is a treat, so much more substantial than the lightweight junk being put out today. I can't believe this flick is so unknown.

and that one scene with Goldie Hawn, as someone said, how did that get past the censor!? Hilarious.",1199664000,9,787,4.542253521126761
727426,4,6303686826,"Vietnam era film that's all but disappeared! One problem is the title itself: it's listed as above and also $$$. (As an example, try looking up ""The Departed"" under ""The""). Too bad, because Beatty and Hawn pull off an ingenious bank robbery in Europe, playing ""Robin Hood"" types preying on the gangland rich. Beatty's racing for safety scenes would make even Matt  Damon (as Jason Bourne) jealous. The movie is both exciting and fun, a rare combination in 2007. You'd even think that  Timothy Leary wasn't now among the ""departed"". Try to pick up a copy for the entertainment and/or for a collector's item.",1193443200,3,606,4.8173076923076925
727427,5,6303686826,"Aside from the killer soundtrack, Quincy Jones during his salad days(Is that Jean Luc Ponty playing the fiddle on ORANGEBLOSSOM EXPRESS?), I like this film because there is camera motion in nearly every shot. I doubt that the director, Richard Brooks, used storyboards to make this film.  There's a scene in the first half where a police car zooms underneath an overpass just as the trailing coaches of two commuter trains break overhead. I wonder how Brooks set up that fantastic shot?!  The chase which occupies the last 30 minutes is almost wholly on foot.  This film has great performances by the supporting actors.  Gert Frobe is comically bungling as the bank's manager.  Arthur Brauss is menacing as the raspy voiced drug smuggler with rear-view mirrors in his shades, ""the Candyman.""  And Scott Brady has a great turn as a corrupt army NCO.  He gets my vote for best movie death scene; ""From one ounce they will make three hundred thousand capsules of L.S.D....""  Look for the scene where Robert Webber pays Goldie Hawn, the film's ""hooker with a heart of gold,"" to ""put out his fire.""  I'm surprised this scene got past the censors!",967507200,11,1141,4.81025641025641
727428,4,6303686826,I saw this movie on television in the beginning of the 80's. I thought it was great fun then and when I bought the video last year I found it to be even better.  Warren Beatty does a great job and so does the other actors.  Quincy Jones great score adds to the suspense. My favorite scene is the  chase on the ice.

727487,5,6303686826,"A bank heist takes place. Safety deposit boxes are emptied. Yet the robbery is not reported. The owners of the boxes cannot reveal the theft of their money. To do so would mean admitting to various criminal activities.
Joe Collins (Warren Beatty) and Dawn Divine (Goldie Hawn) have pulled off an almost perfect caper and the police aren't after them. But the bad guys are!
Tough, intelligent, crafty. And with Western Europe in the 1970s as a backdrop.

727540,3,6303686826,"One of a spate of heist/caper comedies from the early-to-mid '70s ('The Hot Rock,' 'The Anderson Tapes,' 'What's Up, Doc?,' 'Foul Play,' etc.), many involving the top talent of the day, '$' doesn't fare much better or worse than its peers, mostly due to the manifest indecision over what type of animal the picture is meant to be.  (What's to blame in these cases-- an overvalued screenwriter reined in by meddling studio execs? the objectives of an autocratic director colliding with those of nervous investors?-- is sometimes more interesting to ponder than the labored mechanics of the film.)  This isn't to say you can't have two things for the price of one, but striking an audience-pleasing balance seems always to be the sticking point with these cross-genre affairs: too much action/suspense voids the humor; too much goofiness deflates the stakes; and so on.  So back to '$,' which mixes good ingredients (Gert Frobe, Goldie Hawn and a fun little bank-robbery sequence) with bad (Warren Beatty, dull as ever; several poorly drawn background characters; and some very slapdash slapsticks wedged in at uneven intervals) in search of a winning formula, and whose overall effect isn't cohesive enough to constitute anything more than two hours' loose entertainment.  As a fan of gritty '70s cinema, however, I must add that I enjoyed Richard Brooks' ('Blackboard Jungle,' 'Elmer Gantry,' 'Lord Jim,' 'In Cold Blood') nod to the kind of guerilla filmmaking that had become popular during the era, complete with kinetic, naturalistic camerawork invoking an urban edginess and underscored by some equally streetwise R&B riffs, making '$' a worthwhile time-capsule piece.  3-minus stars.",1378339200,3,1688,5.260223048327138

727542,2,6303686826,"Although a must for Goldie fans, this 1973 film does little to arouse the senses. Even this well-planned bank robbery is much too light-headed to offset the serious acting talent of Gert Frobe (of Goldfinger fame).

More power to Goldie for the leg up this flick provided. Otherwise, there is little else to say, except that if not a Goldie fan, the film can be avoided.",1344816000,,370,4.606060606060606

DOLLARS is a heist flik, a clever, suspenseful scheme to rob the safety deposit boxes of a Swiss bank holding the illicit loot of thieves, smugglers, and traffickers who cannot report the theft.

 After his menacing role as Auric Goldfinger, it is a pleasure to see Gerd Frobe playing the bank manager who can't resist a pretty skirt.  The chase sequence, with the crooks after the plotter who designed the bank's security for his own cracking, Warren Beatty, is one of the longest on film.  Playing her shtick as a ditzy hooker who fingers the crooks for fleecing with a comic touch, Goldie's part is small, but pivotal when she outfoxes her partner in the final scene.",1306108800,,811,5.622950819672131
727544,4,6303686826,"This is definitely an off beat picture!  Goldie Hawn and Warren Beatty are extremely talented performers yet they spend much of this film going in opposite directions, in spite of being partners in this caper, which rather dilutes their chemistry.  So the result is frequently uneven but still entertaining.  The supporting cast is excellent featuring Gert Frobe (Goldfinger) and Robert Webber.  One stellar feature of the film is the music score by Quincy Jones which shows off the considerable talents of Little Richard and the Don Elliot Voices to good effect.  Music lovers will note that Quincy Jones repeats several lines of lyrics from the song ""Money"" in the title song of his album ""The Dude"". As uneven as it is, I have always found this movie a lot of fun.  Goldie Hawn is a hoot, no matter what she does, and here she is daffy and funny as she gets away with the loot.  As Variety would say, it's an ""amiable time waster"".",1300492800,,934,4.658536585365853
727545,5,6303686826,"Money, a movie which is just about non existent, is a movie that I saw in the theater well over thirty years ago.  I have, over the last twenty, tried (in vain) to purchase this movie on DVD.  If you look on the two stars filmography, (Warren Beatty Goldie Hawn) this movie is very rarely mentioned.  I'm not sure if it's because they considered it a low budget film or neither one wants to remember making it.  But, it's really a very good movie. The plot was good, and to my knowledge, had not been done before this film. I think the controversial role of Goldie Hawn, playing a prostitute, may have been a factor in the down playing of this movie, because, it was not long after that Ms Hawn won an academy award for Cactus Flower. Warren Beatty, on the other hand, plays his typical, lover boy role, although he's restricted to only Ms. Hawn in this movie.  A bank heist, a couple of crooks (Beatty, Hawn) who are robbing thieves, (the mob, local and military crime bosses) of illegal money, that cannot be reported to the police. Will the crooks figure out who did it? Will Beatty and Hawn get away with it? This all makes for an enjoyable movie, and since it's really not in many rental, streaming, or buying circles, I'm pretty sure it's not been seen two many times since it's initial release.  Check it out, it's a movie well worth watching, and for my money, ""Dollars"" was worth every cent.",1269993600,3,1400,4.428015564202335
727546,4,6303686826,"The best part of this bank heist flick is the final third with one of the longest chase scenes I've ever seen on film. In fact, Warren Beatty and the two guys chasing him must have been Olympic marathon runners to keep up that pace for so long, racing through Germany.

This is a mixture of lighthearted and gritty material about an international robbery. Joining Beatty (""Joe Collins"") in the hijinks is a young Goldie Hawn (""Dawn Divine"") and Gerte Frobe, of ""Goldfinger""  James Bond fame.

I had given up on ever seeing this out on DVD, so I am pleasantly surprised to find out it finally has, in December of 2008.  I'll definitely consider picking this up.",1246752000,,660,4.567796610169491
727547,3,6303686826,"Dollars is a bank heist-car chase movie from the early 1970s. Shot with a low-ball urban shoe-string look and sensibility. It contains the motifs of this genre that keeps it's core audience satiated. Fast cars, daring heist, 'good guys' & bad guys with little or no morals, loose women, shady dealings, where no-body relevant to the story gives a f***. Quincy Jones (The Getaway) supplies the soundtrack, great fun, also available, somewhere. Goldie Hawn looks delicious, post-war Hamburg looks bleak, Warren Beatty is effective and not showing off in his role.
