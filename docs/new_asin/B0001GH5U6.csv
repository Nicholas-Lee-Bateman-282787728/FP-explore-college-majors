1998026,3,B0001GH5U6,"This is supposed to be for beginners! The AM Yoga is done by Rodney Yee, instead of Patricia Walden. He goes too fast and doesn't tell you when you need your strap or block. Patricia Walden goes at an easier pace and lets you know when you need an accessory. I won't buy anymore exercise/yoga videos with Rodney Yee, He assumes you already know how to do some of the poses/exercises and that you will know what you will need in the way of accessories to use. Patricia Walden did the AM Yoga that is found on VHS. I thought that's what I was getting, but just converted to DVD.",1385251200,,576,4.245454545454545
1998027,5,B0001GH5U6,I loved this video when I got it on VHS and was very pleased when I found it on DVD.  Thanks!,1382659200,,93,3.4285714285714284
1998028,5,B0001GH5U6,"I gave this as a gift to someone I really like, because I use my copy every morning. It is a gentle way to wake up.",1380672000,,115,3.4615384615384617
1998029,5,B0001GH5U6,"If you want to try yoga, or if you are older and inflexible, or if you are recovering from an illness, A.M. and P.M Yoga might be a good match for you!

In the a.m. portion of the DVD, Rodney Yee guides you through very gentle yoga positions, which will help energize you and prepare you to make the best of the opportunities in your day. Patricia Waldren provides equally relaxing, but slightly more difficult yoga positions, to help you relax in the evening.

Breathing correctly during poses is an important part of yoga. A better DVD that incorporates breathing into more slightly more challenging yoga positions is Element's AM and PM yoga for beginners, with instructor Elena Brower, a certified Anusara teacher.",1357516800,2,718,4.829268292682927
1998030,5,B0001GH5U6,"I have owned this set for years & the tape wore out.  Replaced with the CD, which is well laid out - you can skip and I love not having to rewind.  Even my trainer gives this high marks because the choice of stretches used really stretch my core and energizes me.",1356307200,,263,4.038461538461538
1998031,5,B0001GH5U6,"I have been using this workout for years.  Rodney Yee takes you though a wonderful wake-up stretch that keeps you going all day.  I had to purchase the dvd because I was using a vhs tape and no longer have a way to view it.  Not that I need help getting through the workout, but the music is soooo relaxing and helps with the meditation.",1333238400,,337,4.153846153846154
1998032,5,B0001GH5U6,"This is a really relaxing and easy to learn session.  Rodney's voice is very gentle, and just what is needed in the morning and evening to transition from waking to sleeping, and sleeping to waking.  I'm glad I bought this DVD.",1316044800,,227,4.512195121951219
1998033,3,B0001GH5U6,The a.m. portion of this DVD is helpful. The p.m. portion is much too advanced for this over-60 and returning-to- yoga beginner.,1310342400,,128,4.863636363636363
1998034,5,B0001GH5U6,I had the VCR tape of AM and PM yoga and I have used them so much I was afraid they would break so I bought this DVD.  I am 50 something and have a bad back and this has worked miracles for my back and also helps me focus and relax at the beginning and end of the day.  I would highly recommend this DVD!,1269561600,14,304,3.590909090909091
8012078,5,B0001GH5U6,Had this same Yoga video. Gave it to my Sister.,1495756800,,47,3.8
8012079,5,B0001GH5U6,"I'd previously worked out to this video and thought it would be beneficial to my father, who has back/vertebral problems.  It turns out it has worked well for him and he has already reported improvement.  I would recommend it to those struggling with back-related problems, tight muscles, and high blood pressure, as it energizes the body at the beginning of the day and relieves stress before bed.",1487030400,3,398,4.925373134328358
8012080,5,B0001GH5U6,"Big fan! Of this video! I have a short attention span and I can typically make it to the end, morning and night. Also it's easy to follow good instructions so much in fact you don't have to stare at the tv to see how to do it.",1470355200,,226,3.7291666666666665
8012081,5,B0001GH5U6,"Great for beginners! I was a beginner when I got this in VHS format and love it. I'll admit that I do the morning more than the evening. It's best to watch it a few times and take things gently, at your own pace - you can't fully stretch out like  the instructor does. I have a dance background and understand the importance of gently easing into a stretch when you have been stiff.  The progression of the stretches really does help you get your blood going and loosen you up for the day. I've done this so much that I remember the sequence and sometimes do the stretches to my own music.",1453939200,,589,4.20353982300885
8012082,5,B0001GH5U6,"I used the DVD on a daily basis, can combine strengthen, and meditation on one dvd,recommend product 100%",1432684800,,105,4.888888888888889
8012083,5,B0001GH5U6,"I originally bought this yoga DVD in 2001 (says it was released in 2004 I can tell you that is not the case) and I loved it then and I still love it now.  Back in 2001 I was a single gal and lived alone and did the PM portion nightly and my flexibility and muscle tone changed dramatically.  I was much thinner back then and didn't mind the emphasis on correct form and the slow pace was actually soothing because as one reviewer mentioned it's either look or listen but because you aren't flowing from one pose to another quickly you can do both.  Now that it's 2015 I am picking this back up for the 6th time because I've gained weight and find that it is easy to follow and I am gaining flexibility quickly.  I have tight hip flexors and it causes serious lower back issues and by following this DVD and another series of hip stretches I have been able to go from sitting down to put socks on (can't stand on one foot) to easily reaching down and putting my socks & shoes on (seems little it's a huge win for me).  I would suggest this for a beginner who isn't looking for a ""workout"" but rather than something to add to their regimen to lengthen their muscles or someone like me who let age and life keep them from working out and wants to limber up and get better prepared for a harder more challenging series.",1420588800,2,1315,4.2023809523809526

8012085,5,B0001GH5U6,"Fundamental Yoga from the best instructors.
Wow! I've had this for the longest time, more or less than 10 years. My first yoga find and still my all time favorite.
I bought this when there was the VHS version not in DVD yet. Then everybody got rid of their VHS players, I bought another DVD copy again.
Patricia Walden and Rodney are in my opinion the very best. Precise instruction, beautiful scenery, soothing music. I wake up and do the morning routine every day during my work week. It has been a staple of my everyday life. The evening routine with Patricia Walden I can not live without after a long and stressful day at work. Good stretch and deep breathing help me relax and guarantee a good night sleep. Highly recommended.
This DVD is the beginner's level. Most influential Yoga program for any level of yoga enthusiasts.",1402876800,,831,4.621621621621622
8012086,5,B0001GH5U6,"After practicing yoga for years now, this is one I can still go back to and it's never outdated. Got it when I was a beginner so didn't know anything. I did feel a slight difference at first, then it turned me into wanting more and more. So I started to go to a class near my home. Ends up it was Bikram yoga and made me advance really fast, couldn't get enough of it. Well, even after a break from yoga cause I stopped for a short while. I had this video and it really takes you into a really good place every time I use it. My recommendation is to do both everyday because your body will just love and appreciate it so much. If you can do only one, do the morning yoga. Its 15-20 mins and is worth every second. Take the last few minutes of meditation. I was not a huge practitioner of meditation until recently but I wish I knew in beginning the benefits of meditation. If you have no
Time for yoga, make time for 5 min meditation. Go to you tube and look one up.",1395360000,,966,4.010362694300518
8012087,5,B0001GH5U6,"I love Rodney Yee, and his A.M. Yoga is the DVD that introduced me to yoga.  It's the one I do when I don't want to do yoga, when I am in pain and stiff, when I am tired.  It prepares me to get through the day.  It prepares me for more advanced Rodney Yee yoga DVD's.  I have done Patricia Walden's P.M. Yoga, but don't enjoy it as much as ""my morning cup of"" A.M. Yoga.  This is THE best yoga workout for any level, for people that are recuperating from illness and injury.  The actual workout is about 17 minutes long.  So when you know you should do your yoga but don't feel like it, just do this short A.M. Yoga workout.",1390262400,,624,3.9838709677419355
