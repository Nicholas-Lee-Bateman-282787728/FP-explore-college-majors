3723508,5,B001NVW4PO,"This is my first DVD/workout with Ilaria. I enjoy kickboxing type workouts and was looking for some-thing and some-one new. After a bit of research I decided to go with this one, and I am satisfied.  The workout begins with Ilaria giving a beginners demonstration of how each move should be done properly and in good form to maximize workout and prevent injury.  I learned some new things.

The workout itself is similar in that she begins each movement slow and after you had a chance to grasp it, she picks up the pace.  She alternates between left and right side of the body, so the workout is even.  And though not a dancing-type workout, your heart-rate will climb (due to kicks, squats, jabs, etc), making it aerobic in that sense.  And you will surely feel sore muscles after wards!  Well at least I did and this was a signal that I did something right.  To enhance my workout, I also used 2lb hand weights, which I've done with other DVD workouts.

Ilaria is a great instructor and her cuing is fantastic.  I also liked the background music; it was appropriate, while not being distracting.  Again, this is not a dance-type workout, like you might find in Turbo Jam.

So, if you like kickboxing or just want to introduce variety into your workout routines, I would highly recommend this one.",1301011200,2,1299,4.6
3723509,5,B001NVW4PO,"Terrific exercise DVD.  It's a great workout, and fun too.  Ilaria does a great job of explaining the correct positions and builds to some interesting combinations. Requires some concentration the first time or two.  I've been doing kick boxing for 15 years or so and found this to be a challenging, but not exhausting workout. Looking forward to trying her other Powerstrike DVD's.",1299715200,,382,5.031746031746032
3723510,4,B001NVW4PO,"I had heard good things about Ilaria's videos, so I got this one first.  She is cleary a very fit instructor, and gives good cuing and form for the kickboxing moves.  She is also personable with her background students and adds some variety to the choreography. I have been kickboxing for a while, teaching in a group fitness setting and collecting many of Amy Bento, Cathe Freidrich, Kimberly Spreen and Tracey Staehle's videos; I just found this routine to be somewhat dry and boring.  It is probably meant for beginners to intermediate more, especially because she has a long tutorial at the beginning of the video. It didn't challenge me physically like I was hoping. There was also no menu on the dvd to speak of, although you can click through the chapters once it's playing.  I will however, keep collecting Ilaria's videos; already bought ""Forza"" sword fighting DVD's Vol. I & II, can't wait till my son opens his Kendo sword for Christmas!",1292630400,,948,4.762195121951219
3723511,4,B001NVW4PO,"A bit strange, I just noticed that the DVD that came is Powerstrike (as pictured) not Powerstrike4 as the text indicates.  I wanted plain Powerstrike (having seen clips) so I got what I was expecting.

I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

Pros:  Started of easy, then worked up serious sweat with legs burning in the end.  This instructor really worked for me.  Serious --- I prefer someone who isn't smiling the whole time --- but throws in a smile now and then so you know she's friendly rather than a drill instructor.  Non-annoying voice, easily understandable cuing.  I prefer small groups like this with instructor and 3 assistants (two women, one man) --- alone seems rather weird sometimes and more than 3 is just distracting.  Coming from a martial arts background (but trying to lose weight/keep in shape) it's nice finding a way to blend the two with someone who clearly emphasizes trying to keep more traditional form.

Cons: I think some people may be discouraged by some of the more complex routines and repetitive motions but both actually worked fine for me because I could understand she was trying to balance form with cardio.  The workout seemed like it was created on a rather limited budget (looks like it was filmed in a real workout studio with mirror, actual music with singing, and the dvd menu looks like it was created using a home computer.)  Having said that, it did not detract from a solid result.

This being a more serious martial art/cardio fusion workout than others I have tried in the genre, some thoughts:

If you are looking for actual martial arts, well, you need to take a martial arts class, frankly.  I don't think you will ever learn self-defense or philosophy with an exercise video (or any video, really, that would be more of a supplement rather than an effective self-learning tool.)

I think the difficult sell for these martial arts cardio fusion workouts is that any cardio routine tends to be, well, girly, for lack of a better word --- I just don't really see a flood of manly men running to do these even though they can be hella tough to actually do.  Also, any of these kickbox/box/cardio fusion routines are going to result in form/power suffering from trying to set a cardio pace.  This would be even more of a risk for those new to the form who are trying keep a fast pace but do the move wrong or don't have the flexibility/muscles for it yet (because they aren't moves you usually ever do in everyday life.)

That said, I thought this instructor did one of the best jobs I've seen yet of trying to keep clean form in a cardio routine.",1288051200,13,2614,4.619047619047619
3723512,5,B001NVW4PO,"There is something about Ilaria that is just fascinating. There is so much carisma. I love her instruction and I love to watch her, her physique is amazing. My favorite is when she says ""roundhouse"". Anyway, this DVD is perfect. It works arms, core, and hips in particular. It is mostly low impact (but plenty of sweat) and you can easily insert your own fillers (like jogs, scissors, jumping jacks or plyos) to make it more intense. It's not at all hard to follow. The cueing is perfect. I own 3 other Ilaria DVDS and they're all great. I see she's coming out with one that uses weights - can't wait!",1281916800,,601,4.423423423423423

3723514,5,B001NVW4PO,"This dvd is amazing, I've never done a workout that was so much fun before. I love how fast the hour goes by. The instructor is great and gives all the right reminders. I'll admit though, this isn't for people who've never exercised before. It's super hard, but worth it. I've already noticed a difference in my endurance after doing this dvd only five times in the past two weeks. Also there is some great instruction before the workout even starts on how to punch and kick correctly in all the different forms she uses in the workout. I don't think there could be a better kickboxing dvd out there.",1248998400,3,600,4.463636363636364

8327990,5,B001NVW4PO,"I'm a beginner to intermediate. I took a kickboxing class for six weeks and that was 15 years ago. In my late 20's I purchased ""HITS with Lori Dean"" and that was my first introduction to the kickboxing/cardio/aerobic fusion. I bought Tae Bo a few years later and intensely disliked how fast it was and what it did to my knees. I have P90X and have worked with it on and off for two years. Lastly, I'm the kind of workout person who does from time to time lose the discipline (I may go for months w/o workouts.) This is the background I use for my review of Powerstrike. If you've never seen it, do like another reviewer did and check it out from the library or at the very least, look for snips of the video on You Tube.

I watched this video twice before working out. Like another reviewer said, this is low impact (no jumping, plyometric type stuff) but high intensity if you put muscle into it. My heart rate reached and exceeded my target every time and this is w/o going 100% on the punches or kicks. For me, the squats easily get my heart rate going. The deeper the squat, the more I work out. The music is terrific; the instruction is superb (like a lot of reviewers, one of my peeves is an annoying voice or silly words of encouragement that some instructors on DVD feel compelled to say (Kathy Smith comes to mind but that's another review). I love Ilaria's accent too. She is a bit soft spoken, but not difficult to understand (maybe mic is too soft, but for me this is a good thing--if you've done P90X Tony Horton is too damn loud at times).

I too love that the background of the video is simple with only three other performers along with Ilaria. Unlike some other kickboxing DVDs, POWERSTRIKE camera angles remain pretty steady. From time to time the camera focuses on a particular performer, or a particular move; but w/o special effects or to-the-beat camera changes. All the performers are wearing clothes that enhance the move and physique that if you need to study a move, any of the performers is a good model (there's nothing worse than trying to study a move and a performer is wearing black).

One of the things that I love about HITS with Lori Dean is that even though she does work out BOTH sides of the body, the routines are different. With POWERSTRIKE, indeed, you work out both sides of the body but using the same exact routine. This might be or get boring with time. I don't find it boring because the introduction to each part of the routine is massive workout on its own (your legs, hips, and buns will feel it--and that's just the intro to the routine). Then again, I'm the type of person who still, after 10 years loves HITS with Lori Dean (it's ingrained in my head).

I find this video routines easy to modify if necessary--if you feel like 80% one day, or 110% on another it's easily doable. I love that I can focus on technique for a good bit because she drills the routines for a good while (not too long that you get bored, just long enough to ""get it"" and not too short that you feel like you're falling behind).

If I have to dislike something about POWERSTRIKES it would be two things: 1) like another reviewer mentioned the DVD menus and such. My copy actually skips a little, it doesn't bother me as much but POWERSTRIKE is a bit pricey compared to other exercise videos out there (it's worth the money though). I usually don't bother with the menus. One of the things I would love to have seen on the DVD is audio options on the menu (P90X and Shiva Rae's DVD have interactive menus or matrix where you can select audio instruction or music only w/no instruction etc.) I hope newer DVD by Ilaria and many others, will have this.  And 2) the cool down at the end, boy it does not feel like a cool down. She goes through ""samurai squats"" and like I said earlier, my heart rate actually shot higher towards the end there (170+). You will have to pause the video to do an actual cool down. Soon after the samurai squat you bend over to stretch. Clearly, you must modify and not follow verbatim at this point if your heart rate does not come down quickly.

If you are a beginner to intermediate I think you'll like this video a lot, if not love it. If you're like me and have not worked out for a while or are an absolute beginner you might have a bit of trouble (if you have knee issues with squats) so learn to modify or ease into this video with other work outs. I believe that if you are advanced, you will still enjoy this video, again, it's what you put into it. Intensity comes from the power behind kicks and punches (just as you modify a routine ""down"" if you are a beginner, I'm sure you can modify a routine ""up"" if you are advanced). This for me at least is the best cardio work out I own (and I've gone through a ton from Richard Simmons to Billy Blanks to P90X).",1344729600,8,4819,4.312362030905077
8327991,5,B001NVW4PO,"I just started kickboxing and this is a great workout! I had no trouble following the routine once I did the workout a few times but that goes with any NEW workout routine. It's a workout that covers the whole body and give you a really good sweat. It's good for people who are moving from beginner to intermediate. The dvd is tricky to maneuver at first, if you need to stop, just pause it and when you are ready to resume, take it off of pause and it will continue from the point you started.",1342310400,,494,4.15625
8327992,5,B001NVW4PO,"I love Ilaria's workouts.  If you, like me, have given up on the pink, fluffy hippy-skippy approach to ""cardio kickboxing"" videos (particularly those targeted at women), this series is for you.  Powerstrike 4 is friendly and approachable, and Ilaria's no-frills manner is reassuring, pleasant and resonant for anyone with a brain in her head.  Her gorgeous, well-muscled body itself is of course an aesthetic motivation, and her power and control are absolutely inspiring - and all without her calling out about how good you're going to look in your yoga pants.

The introduction at the beginning is a must if you want to take this even a tad bit more seriously than Turbo Jam and its ilk - but even if you have actually done sparring workouts, you won't be bored.  You will feels stronger, fitter, and you will want to aspire to greater heights.  Brava, Ilaria!!",1337731200,2,863,4.836734693877551
8327993,3,B001NVW4PO,"Disclaimer: This was my first time trying kickboxing, and I have gone through the DVD twice now.

Having used this so few times, I can't speak to how long I would use this DVD for if I were to purchase it (I borrowed my copy from the library).  But as for right now, I find the workout WILDLY entertaining and fun, to the point that I wish my muscles would hurry up and recover so I can do it again!  It's like an addiction already!
Ilaria and her co-exercisers are, quite obviously, having a good time as they go through the routine, and I think that's a plus.  They are all perfectly in sync with each other, and, as far as I can tell, very in sync with the music, too!
As a trance fan who is familiar with Sarah Atereth (the sole musician played), I really enjoyed the soundtrack.
Five stars on the workout, for sure.  Despite being completely out of step and time with the instructors, I didn't find the camera angles cutting away from legs to be a problem, as other reviewers did.
I do have a quibble, though, with the section of the DVD between the introduction and the part labeled ""Routines.""  It seems to only cover left stance, and then doesn't switch to right stance so as to work both sides of your body evenly.  Is this an oversight or am I missing something here?

Anyway, so why doesn't this product earn five stars when almost all I've said so far is positive?  One word: usability.  This DVD has, bar none, the absolute worst menu and chaptering I have ever seen in a professional release, period.  Full stop.  No main menu appears unless you press the Menu button on your remote, and it, as another reviewer noted, appears to have been made on someone's computer.  Someone's computer running Windows ME, that is.  Circa 2001.  There's also a typo in the displayed title.
Then we get to the chaptering.  Oh, the chaptering.  There is an instructional introduction of several minutes' duration.  Want to hit the Next Scene button on your remote to skip it, since you'll only need to watch it a couple of times, or not at all if you're already an experienced kickboxer?  Have fun!  You'll just land somewhere in the middle of the workout instead of at its beginning.  Want to jump to the part labeled ""Routines""?  No again!  How about the credits?  Good luck!
THERE IS NO RHYME OR REASON TO ANY OF IT.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  I can't believe this actually made it to market.  When I buy this DVD, because I am fairly sure I will, I will probably rip it to my Mac, throw it into iDVD, and redo the whole setup from scratch so it is actually user-friendly.  Because it's just painful to use, otherwise.  I am fortunate in that I have the time, knowledge, and software to make this DVD better, but the point is, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.  And woe unto you if you can't or don't know how to edit and burn your own discs.

So, I give Powerstrike 3 stars, and that was on the strength of the workout alone.  I would have happily rated it a 5 if someone even remotely competent had been in charge of publishing this to DVD.  Alas.",1335744000,9,3041,4.382826475849732
8327994,5,B001NVW4PO,"Ilaria Montagnani is a very inspiring, and motivating instructor.  Her direction and cuing is excellent and no-frills.  You can tell that this person actually lives what she teaches and is very ""grounded"".

I highly recommend this particular workout to get a feel for her style - you won't be disappointed, if you are looking for a no-nonsense, energizing workout.",1332288000,,364,5.135593220338983
8327995,5,B001NVW4PO,"Great, engaging, challenging workout.  It takes a few times to get the routine, but it is so much fun.  By the time it is over I am sweating like crazy, and my heart rate is where I want it.  I love Ilaria's workouts, from both Bodystrikes to Atletica and other Powerstrike workouts.  She is the most impressive trainer I have ever worked out with, bar none.  I have used P90X and several others, and I have to say, not only does she get you working, but she is never irritating, only inspiring.",1322611200,,495,4.336956521739131
