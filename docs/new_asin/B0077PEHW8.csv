8512094,4,B0077PEHW8,"Once again Mill Creek Entertainment decided to put two Documentary Series together on one DVD Set, and the results are great. The two Series you'll find on this set are: BIRTH OF FLIGHT-A HISTORY OF CIVIL AVIATION and RAILROADS-TRACKS ACROSS AMERICA. This 5-Disc collection contains over 19 Hours of fascinating documentaries, chronicling both the complete history of the airplane and the development of the railroad industry. This set is perfect for History buffs since there isn't a lot of documentaries available on DVD chronicling the entire history of both airplanes and railroads, therefore this collection is a very good idea. Both Series are very interesting, very well researched and full of fascinating information. If, like me, you enjoy watching historical documentaries and if you enjoy learning more about the past then this DVD set will be a great addition to your library.
