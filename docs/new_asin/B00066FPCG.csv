2170084,5,B00066FPCG,"Kolchak: Night Stalker and the two prior TV movies were the inspiration behind the greatest television series ever made, of course in my opinion , The X-Files.  I actually remember viewing the original Kolchak series as a ten-year old (don't ask about parental restictions in my home at the time...)and being scared, really scared.  It's doesn't quite have the same effect on me now but I still find it creepy and suspensful in parts and overall great fun.

I had hoped that the new ""Night Stalker"" series that aired last autumn would be just as good but surprisingly it wasn't and was soon cancelled, rightly so.  It was the baby of two of the people behind the ""X-Files"", especially Frank Spotnitz, but somehow failed to capture the spirit of both the old ""Nightstalker"" and it's latter prodigy.  So please watch and enjoy the elder ""Nightstalker"" and don't forget to switch the lights off!",1124841600,6,892,4.803921568627451
2170085,5,B00066FPCG,"Since the announcement of a ""modern update"" was announced for Night Stalker (with Stuart Townsend as Kolchak), I knew two things... The new series will more than likely be terrible, and two, that Universal will finally release the original series on DVD to coincide with the new series.  Nothing gets these studios off of their rears like self-promotion.  Well, all I can say is ""It's about time!""

I loved watching Kolchak: The Night Stalker when it first aired (I was in 4th grade).  Reruns aired in the early 80's as part of a rotation on the CBS evening movie or late movie, or whatever they called it.  Sci-Fi has been running them occasionally with little or no pre-announcement and unfortunately 4 episodes (Legacy of Terror, Demon and Lace, Firefall, and The Energy Eater) have only been presented as two movies that merely combined the episodes into a confusing mess called ""Demon and the Mummy"" and ""Crackle of Death"".

Finally we will have all 20 episodes as they should be seen.  The lack of special features is disappointing but not suprising.  As other reviewers have commented, I would love to hear commentary from Jeff Rice, David Chase, and/or especially Darren McGavin.  I don't normally review something before it hits the streets, but short of a gigantic mess-up on Universal's part, a high rating is definately warrented for this amazing series.

Personal favorites: ""Horror In The Heights"" which the Kolchak Companion describes as the episode most likely to sell the series to a non-viewer.  Also high on the creep scale are ""The Spanish Moss Murders"", ""Chopper"", and ""The Zombie"".  What a great gift just in time for Halloween!",1124755200,125,1650,4.938405797101449
2170086,4,B00066FPCG,"Before ""The X-Files"", Darren McGavin was reporter Carl Kolchak whose news stories would focus on the supernatural and science fiction aspects of a story. ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" only ran a short (it was only about 20 episodes)season on ABC. Although it lacked the creative fire power of the two TV movies (Producer/director Dan Curtis, director John Moxey and writer Richard Matheson were not involved with the series at all), the best episodes had a sharp sense of humor and a couple of young contributors that would make their mark elsewhere (the creative team behind ""Back to the Future"" and the writer-producer of ""The Sopranos"" were both contributors to the series). I realize that writer/creator Jeff Rice ended up suing Universal over the TV series but do wish that an interview with him or commentary tracks had been included.

Released to coincide with the new ""The Night Stalker"" TV series produced/written by Frank Spotnitz (""The X-Files"", ""The Lone Gunmen""), the series is bare bones when it comes to extras.. However, the episodes will be uncut which is a big plus for fans. Having had to suffer through versions burned from the Sci-Fi Channel broadcast, I'll be happy to finally have these sans commercial interruptions.

There's good and bad news about the format; all these are released in the dual layered, dual sided format. Because it requires a disc to be ""pressed"" four times instead of two, there's a higher chance of problems with the discs.  Universal has, in the past, had a problem on occasion with the dual layered/dual sided DVDs freezing up (I recently had a problem with ""McCloud"" and others have had other problems). Hopefully they've solved the manufacturing snafu that caused this problem in the first place and this won't be a problem here. I didn't have any of the discs freeze up on me when I tried them but that doesn't mean that certain players may not have this problem because of flaws during the manufacturing process.

The good news--at last this series is available on DVD. It doesn't look anywhere as good as MGM's release of ""The Night Stalker/The Night Strangler"". There's a lot of debris in the image and the images are very, very dark--much darker than necessary which makes night scenes kind of a problem to view at times (since much of the series takes place at night this could be a problem). The packaging is nice with the shows each stored in a single slim line jewel box which will help prevent wear and tear. ""Kolchak"" was recently voted the worst looking DVD transfer of 2005 (at TVonDVD)because of the poor contrast, image quality, etc. Should you still get it? Absolutely. If you're a videophile the image quality may bother you but if you're just watching it for the enjoyment of the show I doubt it will except on the first couple of episodes.

Sure there were dogs here (the werewolf episode among them) but there were also some exceedingly good episodes that demonstrated a unique, quirky sense of humor that translated well to TV. As a monster-of-the-week horror series, ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" had no peers during the 70's. Among the best episodes are ""Horror in the Heights"" (written by Jimmy Sangster ""Horror of Dracula"")and a number of terrific episodes written by ""The Sopranos"" creator David Chase. I would have loved a commentary track from Jack Grinnage (Ron Updyke)but I suppose that's asking for too much. There are no extras outside of promos for other Universal products. Since there's a blank side on the last disc, there was plenty of room to include some. Why not include the promos that ran on ABC for the show? I'm sure there are vintage interviews with Darren McGavin. Since Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz are such great fans of the series why not interview them (along with Jeff Rice) for the set here?

As a big fan of the late (he passed away in March 2006)Darren McGavin and fan of the original TV movies, I'm glad to see this finally coming to DVD but do wish that Universal had included either vintage interviews that McGavin gave at the time or, better yet, commentary tracks or current interviews with McGavin or the surviving cast/production members. It may not be perfect but, hey, at least it has finally arrived on DVD.

Were there cheesy episodes? Sure but then again it's good cheese with witty dialogue and great performances from a seasoned cast of veterans. The best episodes showed wit and imagination and look pretty good even though optical effects and make up weren't quite as advanced as today. You can see Mulder to some extent in Kolchak and Scully's doubting Thomas in Vincenzo. If you get a chance you should also see Darren McGavin's two appearences on ""The X-Files"". He also has a cameo (via digital technology)in a witty tip of the hat in the pilot episode of the new ""Night Stalker"" TV series. Oh and got to love that seersucker suit! We'll miss you Darren but at least we have your terrific performances in film and TV shows!",1124150400,355,4948,4.793669402110199
2170087,5,B00066FPCG,"These two episodes are perhaps the best of the legendary short lived TV series of 1974-1975. Karl Kolchak is a fading big city newspaper reporter trying desperately to hold on to his job at the fictitious INS News Service in Chicago . . . only each week his big scoop turns out to be some monster or ghoul out to kill him!

Interestingly, these two episodes, more science fiction than horror, both deviate somewhat from the usual horror formula. In ""They Have Been, They Will Be"" Kolchak is dealing with aliens who have apparently crash landed on earth. Without ever showing the aliens, we see them chill and thrill their way through Chicago, committing positively uncanny crimes while Kolchak looks for answers. This episode has so much spine tingling suspense and such an open-ended finale that it is really far more effective than the usual stake through the heart routine in other episodes.

MR R.I.N.G. is even better. In this episode, Kolchak is up against a robot who has been brought to life by a team of scientists working for the US Government. Like Frankenstein's monster, the robot is actually more a victim than anything else -- he doesn't understand why he is alive or why cruel men want to destroy him. This episode features a much higher level of sex appeal since the chief scientist who cares for MR. R.I.N.G. is a stunning Latina actress, and her dead partner's widow is also a very sexy and sophisticated older woman. Kolchak should have scored in this episode!",1122508800,5,1480,4.754863813229572
2170088,1,B00066FPCG,"Understand -- I am the world's biggest NIGHT STALKER fan. I saw the premiere at age 11. I own every single episode on video, and both movies. Karl Kolchak is the funniest, coolest, most exciting monster hunter in the world!

But don't buy this video. TREVI COLLECTION and YOUTH KILLER are the two weakest episodes in the series. TREVI is about a witch who kills a bunch of fashion models. There are no scares, just really lame stuff with mannequins coming to life and some poor girl getting scalded in the shower. It's ugly, not scary. Lara Parker from DARK SHADOWS is okay, but not really good as a truly evil human being.

YOUTH KILLER is so bad it should never even have aired. It feels like a ""half speed"" episode in slow motion. There's an ancient Greek goddess causing young singles to age overnight because somehow it helps her stay alive forever. Very poor episode, no action and a lot of needless mockery of the elderly and singles.",1122508800,,941,4.562130177514793
2170099,4,B00066FPCG,"The TV series Kolchak: The Night Stalker ran for one season in 1974-1975, consisting of 20 episodes. Two additional episodes were scheduled to be filmed, but star Darren McGavin was becoming disillusioned due to an exhausting schedule and the fact that he was rewriting scripts plus doing much of the production work without compensation. The ratings were mediocre so he asked to be released from his contract with two episodes yet to be shot. The network granted his request in light of the ratings. I wish Darren wouldve persevered and finished out the season because then wed have two more episodes to enjoy. He was too fatigued at the time to see that this unique and groundbreaking series would be his most well-known role, along with A Christmas Story (1983).

If you haven't seen the two pilot movies,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Night-Stalker-The-Night-Strangler-Double-Feature/dp/B00026L7OU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Night Stalker/The Night Strangler (Double Feature)</a>, I encourage you to view them before checking out the series (the DVD set does NOT include these two movies). The debut movie was the best of the batch with The Night Strangler almost as good and even better in some ways (see my reviews for details). Both movies established the template (formula) for the TV series and myriad books that followed.

The 20 episodes are more of the same, but condensed into 51 minutes and all-around inferior. Theyre all of about the same quality with favorites emerging depending on how interesting the Monster-of-the-Week is, as well as the guest stars, both of which are a matter of taste. The first episode, The Ripper, is a quality beginning for the series but its too much like the two pilot movies for its own good, particularly the first film. Its basically a compressed version with a slightly different monster.

Horror in the Heights is usually cited as the best segment because of the intriguing monster, which can mimic a person the victim trusts. Its actually pretty chilling for mid-70s television. The Trevi Collection is one of my personal favorites because it deviates from formula and contains a twist. The story tackles witchcraft but doesnt make the mistake of doing it in a one-dimensional manner (e.g. the mannequins). The Energy Eater is another fave due to guest stars William Smith, who beams with charisma, and professional-but-sultry Elaine Giftos, both of whom sorta team-up with Kolchak, particularly the former.

The Vampire is distinguished for its ties to the pilot movie and taking place in Los Angeles rather than Chicago, not to mention its vicious no-talking (and sharp) antagonist. Demon in Lace is one of the better episodes due to the intriguing succubus and the campus locale. The Zombie is notable for its formidable foe and one of the creepiest sequences in the last act at a junkyard. The monster make-up in The Werewolf is lame, but I favor the episode because it takes place completely on a cruise ship and features voluptuous & perky Jackie Russell as Wendy (in a black bikini); and Nita Talbot as Paula, who becomes Kolchak's gal pal.

The low points, for me, are the clunky The Knightly Murders (no pun intended), and The Chopper, which devolves into camp. Yet even those episodes have their points of charm. The final segment, The Sentry, is often reviled due to the reptilian creature costume, but it wouldve worked if the creators kept its cartoonish face & teeth obscured. The story rips-off Star Treks Devil in the Dark, but isn't anywhere near as absorbing. Yet this is partially made up for by the beaming & lovely Kathie Browne as Lt. Irene Lamont. Kathie was McGavins wife for 34 years until her death in 2003. You might recall her as hottie Deela in Star Treks Wink of an Eye from seven years earlier. Unsurprisingly, she & Darren have great chemistry.

The concept of the show, and its star (and some of the co/guest stars), are better than the actual execution of most of the episodes. The show needed someone of the caliber of Gene Roddenberry at the helm. As it turned out, the bulk of the pressure & work fell on McGavins shoulders and thus he couldn't even finish out the season. Nevertheless, the show was seminal and acquired a cult-following, influencing more popular future series like The X-Files, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Supernatural and The Walking Dead.

2170110,5,B00066FPCG,"I watched ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" during its one-year run and currently own the ""Night Stalker"" and ""Night Strangler"" movies and the 20-episode season on DVD. Aside from being a low-budget production, the show was a success because of the great horror atmosphere and the acting talents of Darren McGavin. As the loudmouthed, sarcastic, crusading investigative reporter Carl Kolchak, Mr. McGavin set the tone for the audience as he took on the incredible gamut of horrific creatures that he encountered in each gripping episode. A vampire, a Jack the Ripper serial killer, a witch, a doppelganger, a zombie, a headless motorcycle rider, and a Mexican bird god are among the smorgasbord of creepies that Kolchak encountered each week. McGavin was a tremendous character actor and his acting acumen was on display and captured our imagination in each episode. The story lines, the suspense, the music score and the tour-de-force acting talents of Darren McGavin created the magic which made the show a horror genre classic. One of my all-time favorites.",1522627200,,1055,5.211764705882353

The picture quality is good for it's age and I recommend you watch this on a smaller set tv say like 32"" inch or smaller. Why? well if you try watching this episodes on a larger HD 1080p flat screen or for those who has 4k the picture quality is not that sharp and very 70's if you know what I mean. I actually watch this on my old crt tube since the aspect ratio of this dvd is 4:3 and it is perfect! Now for the rest of the episodes it is very good and very campy good for those late night tv watching with popcorn. Darrin McGavin is such a good actor and he could have been a Ghostbuster!

2170147,5,B00066FPCG,"Why does this short-lived, decades-old series still summon up such creepy delight in its fans? And why have any attempts to remake/re-imagine this series failed dismally? Well, there are several reasons:

(1) The setting in the early to mid-1970s is part of its charm, with its lo-fi special effects, the overall 70s ambience, and the sense of absurdity mingling perfectly with the genuinely scary. Add to that all of the wonderful guest stars, often with just a few lines each, but each one a distinctive character.

(2) The stand-alone done-in-one stories, without the encumbrance of any unnecessary series mythology or ongoing story arcs to mire it down. While that's become the norm for TV series today, it's not always the best or only way to go, which seems to have been forgotten. Sometimes, simpler is better. The sheer frenetic energy of the show is enough in itself.

(3) Most of all, it's Darren McGavin. For someone who supposedly didn't care all that much for the character he played, he brought an enormous amount of zest, gusto, and humor to Kolchak. It wasn't just the monsters that made the show, or even Kolchak encountering monsters that made the show -- it was Darren McGavin as Kolchak encountering monsters that made the show! Every moment that he's on-screen is a pleasure, gleefully going over the top just enough & never too much, with his sardonic voiceovers adding to the effect.

The episodes look good, the sound is good, and they all seem to be uncut. So forget any attempts to ""improve"" on what's already perfect in its own right -- most highly recommended!",1509408000,,1588,4.8487084870848705

2170161,4,B00066FPCG,"Kolchak the Night Stalker, Season 1

Kolchak the Night Stalker was a newspaper reporter for the INS company in Chicago who investigated weird and mysterious stories that couldn't be printed. The humor was implicit in these horror stories, Carl Kolchak reported the facts as he saw them, although they strained credibility. The interplay between the employees was part of the humor, as was treating fantasy as reality. If you are amused by old horror movies from the 1930's you will like these. There were twenty episodes from the single 1974-75 TV season.

Disc 1:
01) The Ripper. Jack the Ripper returns to the 20th century.
02) The Zombie. Voodoo enters the world of organized crime.
03) They Have Been, They Are, They Will Be.... Animals are found lacking bone marrow.
04) The Vampire. A Las Vegas call girl uses her customers for her meals.

Disc 2:
05) The Werewolf. Kolchak takes a vacation on a cruise ship, so does a werewolf.
06) Firefall. An episode that deals with spontaneous combustion.
07) The Devils Platform. A politician gains prominence after he sells his soul to the devil.
08) Bad Medicine. An Indian takes the shape of animals to kill wealthy women for their jewels.

Disc 3:
09) The Spanish Moss Murders. A swamp monster terrorizes Chicago.
10) The Energy Eater. A new hospital is plagued by electrocution deaths.
11) Horror In The Heights. Senior citizens are being killed by a mysterious beast.
12) Mr. R.I.N.G. A killer robot is connected to a top secret government project.

Disc 4:
13) Primal Scream. A prehistoric creature is brought to life in a research laboratory.
14) The Trevi Collection. A coven of witches infiltrate the fashion industry.
15) Chopper. A headless motorcycle rider wants his head back.
16) Demon in Lace. A succubus stalks the campus of Illinois State Technical College.

Disc 5:
17) Legacy of Terror. An ancient Aztec mummy is sacrificing guests at a hotel.
18) The Knightly Murders. A medieval knight takes revenge on nightclub developers.
19) The Youth Killer. Applicants to a dating service are dying from instant aging.
20) The Sentry. An ancient lizard like creature dwells beneath an archives building.",1504569600,,2159,4.9502762430939224

2170163,5,B00066FPCG,Loved watching it again!,1504569600,,24,5.25
2170164,5,B00066FPCG,"What's to say other than these 20 episodes which ran on ABC from Friday Sept 13, 1974 - Friday March 28, 1975 have had an outsize influence in comparison with its sinfully short run?  There is much to read about the franchise so I won't plagiarize anything here, but I'll offer two personal observations why this has held my interest over the many years.

1, The franchise, beginning with the TV movies often juxtaposed modern and sometimes obscure advancements with its fantastic scenarios.  In the original movie, the vampire was innovative enough to break into a hospital blood bank, perhaps a first of its kind?  In another episode, terror is initiated by sleep research, then still quite novel, the modern correlation between EEG, REM and dreaming being first published in 1957.  In another episode expansion of a deep underground records facility disturbs a prehistoric creature.  The Federal government since the Cold war years had developed facilities for archiving national records within specially retrofitted limestone mines. In yet another episode a computer dating service is the front operation for identifying prospective victims of a youth-draining demi-goddess.  Hospitals, sleep labs, records archives and computer dating--novel breeding grounds for horror.

2. The characters are uniformly and pointedly eccentric.  Kolchak himself is progressively de-glamorized from the TV movies to the weekly show.  In the first movie, Kolchak trysts shirtless with a girlfriend, scotch in hand--more like the Mike Hammer he had played in 1958-1959 than the paranormal reporter.  Indeed, the Kolchak of the TV show devotes the entirety of his energies to his beat, with no time remaining for extracurricular activities--or relationships.  The drab turn-of-the-century newsroom of the third-rate news service is the only standing set of the production.  Vincenzo morphs from a combative antagonist in the movies to a frustrated but benign ally.  The seemingly only other permanent employees of the enterprise, Ron Updyke and Miss Emily, offer comic relief.  The police captains who are replaced every episode serve as simple foils to Kolchak rather than formidable adversaries.  A host of character and comic actors such as Phil Silvers, Hans Conried, Dick Van Patten, Sorrell Booke, Kathleen Freeman, Jackie Vernon, John Fiedler, Larry Storch, Larry Linville, Jim Backus, Carolyn Jones, Jamie Farr, Severn Darden, Dick Gautier and Dwayne Hickman are allowed full reign to explore their offbeat personas.",1504483200,6,2509,5.477922077922078

I had a knack for watching show that didn't last very long back then.  Like When Things Were Rotten and Bridget Loves Bernie.
Darren McGavin plays a reporter who every week would find a story about Vampires or werewolves or zombies.  Or something like that..

2170187,4,B00066FPCG,"For a long time now, I've had a laundry list of arguably famous TV shows that I've always wanted to watch. And despite this series being way before my time, the premise sounded interesting, especially when I found out that this show was basically the inspiration and precursor to the X-Files. So thanks to my parents having access to the DVDs, I spent about a week watching through the entire series, and came away with a new appreciation for a show that really should've been given the chance to last a bit longer than just one season.

Carl Kolchak is a headstrong, investigative reporter for a local Chicago newspaper, who always winds up finding himself running into trouble of the supernatural kind. From vampires, to werewolves, to ghosts and aliens, Carl will do whatever it takes--even sometimes risking life and limb--to get the story and reveal the truth to the masses.....if the masses will ever believe him, that is.

I'll get what's probably the one and only con out of the way first:  modern viewers are definitely going to have to be a bit forgiving towards the time in which this was made. Special effects-wise, they still hold up pretty well, but this series is definitely planted heavily in the 70s, with some references and lingo that's either outdated (and that a modern viewer won't quite understand, such as jokes about the president at the time) or terminology that would arguably be considered inappropriate (or offensive) now (thankfully, there isn't a lot of it that I could find, though I thought it fair to give warning).

Other than that, the series is all around entertaining and interesting, and I can see where shows like The X-Files got their inspiration. Carl Kolchak is a great main character who uses charm and wit to get the answers he's looking for, and arguably does a better job at investigating mysteries than the police do. He DOES have his flaws---his incredible stubbornness to get the story always lands him in hot water with the police and his long-suffering boss. And he'll go to any length to see his investigation through, including impersonating other people, sometimes taking advantage of his co-workers, and outright breaking into places. But the way in which he and the plots are written, you still greatly sympathize with Carl, as he DOES have a caring heart underneath, and is probably the only one brave enough (and crazy enough) to do battle with the supernatural to ensure the public's safety---making it all the more frustrating when no one believes him.

Where the series really shines, though, is the wildly varying plots it gives us. Each episode is something entirely unique and different---drawing upon all sorts of myths and legends, and not once is an idea or monster or myth repeated.  And in a time where the internet didn't exist yet, Carl has to use every resource at his disposal to discover the secrets behind the monsters and how to defeat them. Some of my favorites include:

""They Have Been, They Are, They Will Be""---in which an alien made up of invisible energy is on the loose.

""The Werewolf""--in which Carl is trapped on a cruise ship with a werewolf, and he has to get really creative to gather the materials he needs to kill it.

""Horror in the Heights""--in which a shapeshifting monster terrorizes a neighborhood. Considering that Carl normally doesn't have much trust in anyone, this episode contains a particularly character-defining moment for him, since the monster makes itself look like the person its victims trust the most. So the illusion it selects from Carl's mind comes as a bit of a surprise.  (This, along with the first episode about Jack the Ripper is probably the only real legit spooky episode.)

""The Trevi Collection""---in which a fashion show is plagued by witchcraft. This one includes a surprise twist as to who the real villain is that I didn't see coming.

And finally, ""Mr. R.I.N.G."" ---in which a self-aware, killer robot is on the loose. Out of the whole series, this is my personal favorite episode, as it's the only time you find yourself sympathizing with the monster of the week, as the robot's reasoning for why it does what it does is totally logical, with an ending that truly sad and makes you think about both the worst and best in humanity.

All n' all, this was a great show that deserved to last a bit longer than it did, with realistic characters and interesting stories. And honestly, we probably wouldn't have all the spooky, supernatural-themed shows that we do now if it wasn't for this series.  I'd recommend this for ages 13+, not necessarily for how scary it is (like I said, there's really only two episodes that'd I'd deem fairly chilling), but for its mature themes of death, sacrifices, and black magic.",1499126400,,4738,4.8118081180811805

2170225,5,B00066FPCG,This is one of those series I wished would have gone on for years. It is truly a shame only one season of Kolchak: The Night Stalker was made. There are so many similarities to the X-Files that you can see why it was the inspiration for the cult classic.  Darren McGavin was a gifted actor who will ever be known for a Carl Kolchak.,1489881600,,332,4.107692307692307

2170235,5,B00066FPCG,"Wow! Mahvelous blast from the past. X-Files originator Chris Carter credited Twilight Zone + Outer Limits for 10% of the idea for ""The X Files,"" 30% to this series (Kolchak); and only 60% ""concept original with me."" Carter even tried to get star Darin McGavin to reprise his Kolchak role on ""X Files."" McGavin later agreed to appear (in several episodes) as ""the father of the X-Files"", a retired FBI profiler who originated the files/system that Mulder later took over. I began watching DVD # 1 (of 5) in my bedroom. When I put DVD # 2 onto my newer DVD/Blu-Ray player in another room, it wouldn't play! I was crushed!! But it ran fine in my bedroom. ""Hmm: must have something to do with that 'Australian format' they mentioned."" So if you order this (and you should: the main characters ""hate"" each other in such a charming, supportive way!), don't despair if the latest and ""greatest"" DVD players can't handle it: spool it up on your oldest player and prepare to enjoy a hilarious stroll through a full spectrum of crypto-zoological arcana ('beasts/monsters/boogeymen and -women that probably don't exist, but that should').",1488067200,5,1127,4.844559585492228
2170236,5,B00066FPCG,"First of all, I want to address the folks that bought earlier versions of the discs that are defective or double sided. I just purchased my dvds in the last few days and these are single sided discs and they all play well. As far as picture quality, the quality is fine, maybe not high quality, but certainly not as dark and muddy as some of the reviewers have said. So I would encourage those of you who bought the earlier double sided discs to try these instead, they may be more satisfying with little or no glitches. Also, if you think the picture is dark, try lightening it with your color filters on your set.

One of the things I really liked about this show is that it is fun to watch with some honestly spooky moments. Mainly though, I like the pseudo noir sort of story telling with Kolchak narrating his adventures over the action. I also like his little summations that leave you wondering what else might be out there.

If you like classic tv from the 70's, these stories will engage you once again. And I really do recommend viewers who had trouble with the double sided discs and the film quality problems to order these newer generation discs. You may be pleasantly surprised.",1488067200,5,1192,4.463302752293578

2170242,4,B00066FPCG,"That's Entertainment.  These are just fun.  Good format with a long-suffering but well-meaning and supporting boss and a weak foil (Updyke).  Darren McGavin is unusually good at the comedic acting, both in expression and in body language.  Perhaps he never got credit for that.  As a native of Los Angeles I enjoy examining the scenes for palm trees and familiar landmarks.  Bad Medicine, for example, did lots of filming in Pasadena.",1487289600,4,434,5.042253521126761

If we would be totally honest with ourselves, we would admit that we'd still love this damn show even if the stories made no sense at all. Just as long as it has the spine-tingling sound track, exciting aura, and the easy-going hero in the person of the irreverent DARREN McGAVIN with his crumpled white suit, straw hat, and little flash camera stumbling bravely into each eerie episode. This is a ""must have"" series for fans of Kolchak.  The picture & sound quality of this 5-DVD set is better than the original telecasts.",1487030400,31,722,4.73015873015873

2170251,5,B00066FPCG,"I'm thrilled that someone went to the time and trouble to issue all the episodes of this off-the-beaten-path program. Carl Kolchak [Darren Mcgavin] and Tony Vincenzo, playing his exasperated editor, make a hilarious pair. Kolcahk, headstrong and virtually uncontrollable, and Vincenzo, constantly trying to bring some sanity and order to their more or less tabloid newspaper. This was a very watchable, and most entertaining series, even though short-lived. It might not suit everyone...nothing ever does. But I think that most people would give this zany and far from ordinary collection of episodes at least one thumb up, if not two.",1486080000,,635,5.36

In addition it's missing the two TV movies that started it all or any bonus features.  If you want those you have to pay another $64.00.  I'd love to give it more, I loved that show when it was on, but I was rather disappointed and though this show deserved better.  Amazon is selling this for $20.00 now so for a diehard fan who wants to see it again that that price is hard to pass up for the complete series.",1479427200,,671,4.099236641221374

It seemed just a tiny notch down from other 1970s shows on remastered dvd like Rockford and Hawaii 50.  I never purchased the original release because of the picture quality complaints.  This is fun to see. I enjoyed it as a kid, and I enjoyed catching a few episodes when the SciFy channel ran the show at noon around the time of the first dvd release.  The show is nice mix of campy humor (think Batman or WildWildWest) and good SciFi stories.  I really like the supporting cast. Simon Oakland, frequent Rockford guest star, is great as the boss Tony V.  They also use a lot of the great 70s guest stars.  As Christmas Story fan, I got kick out Darren McGavin using some of the same expressions that he made famous in the Christmas Story.

If you wanted to buy a single streaming episode: episode 1 the Jack the Ripper story and episode 4 the vampire episode both were good and give you a good flavor of the show.",1476489600,4,1092,4.42

With the exception of the cars , clothing, sets and special effects you would almost think this was a series that was just produced and released! I have waited years to get this top notch quality and uncut version of this show. I have read many reviews of the earlier rendition of the dvd release (on dual disc format) and never allowed myself to purchase the cheap and poorly manufactured copy. This dvd release is all it was hyped up to be. The picture quality is 100% clear. The audio sound fantastic! Carl Kolchak never looked so good!  For all those poor fools who bought the early release of this series on the dual sided dvd disc...scrap those out in a garage sale or good will them and purchase this new version. You will not be disappointed in it. The wait (42 years) was well worth it to FINALLY have such a wonderful and high quality and UNCUT version of this show!!! The only thing that could have made it better was if the company had added the two previous tv movies to the set...then it could truly be called 'The Complete and Uncut' Series.

2170312,1,B00066FPCG,"5 stars for the series (a few bad episodes, but others mostly good). Why no Blu Ray though? Cheap, doesn't care, Universal Studios is why.......This supposed remastered 2016 release IN NOT REMASTERED or RESTORED. It is the same version picture quality wise (like a washed out DVD), as the same release Universal did in the Uk in 2006. You can get that set, which is the same as this for much less at Amazon Uk. Why couldn't cheap Universal restore and remaster these after 10 years? Because they don't care about their history or fans. Plain and simple. Save your money, buy the same, exact set at Amazon Uk, and live with the crummy quality of either set. Better yet, buy MGM;s 2 DVD set of the first two films, ""The Night Stalker: and ""The Night Strangler"" both processed right. Clear, sharp almost Blu Ray quality films on DVD. One of the best DVD remastering I have ever seen. Expensive new, but you can get a used set for much less: https://www.amazon.com/Night-Stalker-Strangler-Double-Feature/dp/B00026L7OU/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1476556911&sr=8-4&keywords=Kolchak+-+The+Night+Stalker.",1469664000,,1092,5.354651162790698

2170315,5,B00066FPCG,"Really great good old fun from the year 1975! Darren McGavin perfectly nails the wonderfully fun character role of the tenacious news reporter, Kolchak. There is not a single bad episode in this one-season series, and it is regrettable that there were no additional seasons scheduled. Because I literally grew up in the Louisiana swamps, my favorite episode is ""The Spanish Moss Murders"". Way ""back in the day"", almost everyone in South Louisiana was all too familiar with the legend of the boogey man from the swamp, Pere Malfait. Don't miss this really fun and somewhat scary TV series!",1468454400,3,588,4.94949494949495

The show can also be campy - way ahead of its time. McGavin also mages Kolchak an intriguing character for his time.  Last but not least it's a smart show which does occasionally incorporate interesting facts into the plot. I highly recommend this show.,1466812800,,414,4.447368421052632

The two pilots were exceedingly well done and set a standard that was difficult to maintain. Both were released as full length movies. Carl was always a comic stereotype of an annoying reporter but he always got his way in the end. That way was to be told to sit down and shut up of course!

He appears twice in The X-Files as a tribute to his ground breaking Fortean adventures. Darren McGavin always gave a good performance in any format! Saw him in"" Under The Yum Yum Tree"" last century , wherein he sort of was the monster:) Scully & Molder owe him a great deal for setting the tone of this style of program.

I returned the set & Amazon sent me a new replacement. Just as before, Disc 1 could not be recognized, operated or played by my player!

Well I made a mistake by not reading the negative reviews about the quality of these dvds.  I should have and not bought them because I eagerly placed the 1st disc into my dvd player and could hardly get through the previews ( No way to forward and get to the Night Stalker itself) as it kept freezing and jumping all over the place. Finally the first episode began and seemed to work fine. But by the third episode it began to freeze and skip around again. I even stopped it in the middle and then pressed resume play to no avail. It just froze again and again until I just gave up.
  This has to be in my experience one of worst transfers to dvd format I've ever come across. And of course it also is much to dark in the night scenes.

My only problem with these episodes is that many are visually too dark to actually see things that are happening on screen. I did read one of the Top Reviews and the reviewer noted this is an issue throughout the entire series due to a flawed transfer process from the originals to DVD. Still, it was fun to catch one episode, if only for the memories the theme song and closing credit brought back.",1428451200,9,592,4.4907407407407405

After all, it is called ""The NIGHT Stalker"" (expect some nighttime settings/shots).  Glad I get to see this unique show in full on dvd.  I recommend that you watch the two made-for-t.v. movies The Night Stalker and The Night Strangler (because they came out first - and the Seattle Underground is an interesting setting).

2170417,4,B00066FPCG,"The transfers are a bit grainy; the audio can be a bit muddy; the volume rises and falls on its own. But I don't care. This was one of those sort of cheesey, good humored, light spirited action/adventure/thriller/ shows that honestly entertained. Darren McGavin's amiable voiceovers invite the viewer to share the creepy fun. The show ran originally in 1974, so keep an eye out for bit players and guest performers who moved on to bigger and better things.",1426377600,3,456,4.784810126582278

  To tell you the truth, you can't get much better than this.  Even though I love the X-Files, this was the inspiration for that TV Show.  And While it only lasted one season, it has garnered a bit of a cult following over the years.

into my compact collection.  I've slow-fast forwarded to different segments of each episode and the picture and

2170521,4,B00066FPCG,"Amongst the many names that resonated in my childhood, largely thanks to my mother's influence, was the intrepid and not all together pleasant Carl Kolchak. After being bamboozled, kicked to the curb and scared half to death, Kolchak finds himself working for the INS in Chicago with a reputation as a loud-mouth troublemaker with both police and fellow news men.

Each episode has Kolchak stumbling on to a supernatural antagonist of one nature or another and details his attempts to expose the menace to a group of non-believers before resorting to solving the matter on his own. The show is definitely hokey, Stephen King once called it the worst show on television in his ""Danse Macabre"", and, while I'd never be caught dead calling it a good show, it's too much fun to ignore!

The TV movies produced by Dan Curtis are the definitive Kolchak, but the TV show is a parade of good fun in the monster of the week mold. Favorite episodes include Jack The Ripper, The Headless Biker, and the finale with the darn goofiest lizard men you'll ever see!

I figured out why these discs come without labels.  It is because they are double sided.  No big deal, turn the disc over and put it back in to get four more episodes.

------------------------------------------

This set is exactly what it seems to be.  It is the TV show in what appears to be its original form.  So that means it is not some restored 1080p rendition.  It is sized like it showed on TV as a square picture and so does not fill a full LCD monitor.  It appears just like when you first saw it many years ago.  So far I have had no issues playing any of the episodes.  Picture it good (as described) and sound is clear.  As you may recall this series was a cheaply done science fiction/fantasy series complete with the low budget special effects and the occasional low lighting scene.  But this was not a disappointment for me at all, it was great to hear his voice one more.

I would also note that the discs look like they are ""PRINT ON DEMAND"" discs.  They came to me with no labels on them.  They were brand spank'n new in perfect condition as the packaging has each disc (three) in separate thin case holders which seat each disc firmly.  So there is no fear of scratched discs from bouncing in shipping as seems to be common today with some publishers and distributors and failed packaging attempts.  It may make it hard to know which disc you have if you mix them up but you can always put your own label on them if you really need to.",1404691200,,1477,4.328467153284672

2170569,4,B00066FPCG,"Note: I got many of the episodes on my Kindle Fire, meaning I could skip the ones I didn't like.

For horror buffs, ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" brought great anticipation to television viewers in 1974. The first two television movies about Jeff Rice's intrepid, if slightly weird reporter were ratings smashes. The same was expected of the show, but the end result wasn't quite what CBS executives envisioned, but it was their own fault.

Personally, I loved the show. Then again, I was only seven years old and didn't get to stay up late enough to catch most of the episodes. Later, in the 70's, CBS late night brought the show back in syndication and I got to see what I missed.

All of the important characters (main and secondary) are here. Darren McGavin as Kolchak. Simon Oakland as beleaguered editor Tony Vincenzo, who always seemed more concerned with the image of the Independent News Service than with serious journalism. Jack Grinnage as Ron Uptight, eh, I mean Ron Updike. Ruth McDevitt as loveable columnist Miss Emily.

McGavin carries the show, always making the story lines believable. Oakland helps but Grinnage and Miss Emily never grew beyond their two-dimensional character portraits.

What helped and hurt the show the most was CBS Television's insistence on a ""monster-of-the-week"" format. Such formats can often turn a good show into a cheesy one and ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" often had plenty of that.

Good guest stars helped and it was fun to see the likes of Larry Linville, Antonio Fargas, Jamie Farr, Raymond Bieri, Keenan Wynn, John Fielder, Shelly Novack, Cathy Lee Crosby and even veteran stalwarts like John Dehner, Phil Silvers, Carmen Zapata, Scatman Crothers, Marvin Kaplan and Nina Foch. As with most TV shows of the time, we got to see some stars before they were stars, such as Erik Estrada (CHiPs), Margaret Avery (The Color Purple), Tom Skerritt (Alien) and Robert DoQui (Robocop).

That said, a detraction from the show had to be the constant run-ins between Kolchak and the police captain-of-the-week. Linville, Wynn, Bieri, James Gregory, William Daniels, Henry Jones and even McGavin's real-life wife Kathie Browne all did the same tired thing -- tried to cover up the incidents in question. It got annoying after the fourth or fifth episode.

And, as you would expect with a TV show culled from a movie, the budget showed in every episode. Plots featuring human monsters fared better, such as former 1961 AFL Rookie of the Year O. William Faison as the Zombie.

Working best were villains who just had to be play their characters with no special effects. This includes Tom Skerritt as a politician who has sold his soul to the devil in ""The Devil's Platform."" It's one of the best shows of the series because much of the face-off between Kolchak and Skerritt is mental and there is no police coverup involved. There are also excellent supporting characters played by Jeanne Cooper and Robert DoQui.

Other excellent work comes from Cathy Lee Crosby in ""The Youth Killer,"" Nina Foch in ""The Trevi Collection,"" Mickey Gilbert in ""The Ripper"" and Williams Daniels (St. Elsewhere, Knight Rider) in ""The Vampire."" For trivia buffs, ""The Vampire"" was originally meant to be the first episode of the show, because the female vampire was one of Janos Skorzny's unknown victims in the original movie. However, to appease CBS executives, who wanted a lot of action in the pilot, they switched it with ""The Ripper.""

The worst episode is, by far, ""The Sentry."" A man-sized lizard, who looks like a man inside a cheap lizard suit, is killing workers at a new underground information storage facility (a concept which is bewildering today with flash drives and hard drives). The monster is shown up close and personal from the start.

Almost as bad is the Ape-Man from ""Primal Scream."" It's clearly an actor in a monkey suit. Both the Ape-Man and the Lizard Man would have benefited more from staying in the shadows. The silly special effects overwhelmed the plot.

Coming in a close third is the ridiculous Headless Biker from ""Chopper."" In a modern riff of Sleepy Hollow, a deceased biker comes back for vengeance and rides around on a motorcycle, chopping off heads with a sword. Stuntman Steve Boyum plays the Chopper but you can see he's got prosthetics as his shoulders are far higher than his arms. And none of the attacks are believable. Even worse, Larry Linville as the police captain Jonas is next to useless, walking around wishing he was back on the set of ""M*A*S*H.""

For those keeping score, in my opinion, these are the better shows of the series: The Ripper, The Zombie, The Devil's Platform, The Vampire, The Youth Killer, The Trevi Collection.

Ones to avoid: The Werewolf; Chopper; Primal Scream, and The Sentry.

The remaining ten episodes can be left up to the discriminating tastes of viewers.

If you have a Kindle, the choice is easy -- pick the ones you like. As for the DVD collection, you'll have to take the good with the bad. The quality is high, though. And even the bad shows can elicit some hilarity.",1398297600,8,5071,4.85747392815759
2170570,5,B00066FPCG,I loved watching these episodes every Friday night 1974-1975. They seem corny by todays standards- but this series was the basis for the X Files in the 90's. Kolchak is an independent news reporter investigating paranormal activity in the Chicago area. Only 20 episodes were filmed. This dvd compilation is worth it. Nothing else (other than the X Files) compares to it.,1398038400,,370,4.983870967741935
2170571,5,B00066FPCG,"Based on the Kolchak Papers, this is the made for TV movie that was an instant hit. The narrative opens with Kolchak in sleazy hotel room, dictating a book into his trademark portable tape recorder, regurgitating the very strange events relating a case he just finished investigation on Las Vegas strip of a number of gruesome murders perpetrated by a vampire.

The success of the production led to a short run series as he is portrayed as a gifted investigative reporter with an attraction for unusual and paranormal occurrences, the viewer see him procuring evidence driving around Chicago in his yellow Ford Mustang convertible. Kolchak has persistently cracked several cases relying on gut instinct and often through sheer dumb luck. But more often than not, Kolchak's prospects are hindered by the complete obliteration of any or all proof to verify his claims. On other occasions his investigations have led to demotion or transfer of variable authority figures, the reasons for which are never truthfully disclosed, and hence the feeding the viewer's believe of a cover up.
As a youth I caught this film late night on the TV and found the whole movie rather spooky and scary at times. Kolchak was played by Darren McGavin, and he really brought a unique feel to the film - although I might add the Vampire was pretty spooky.

I've heard that Chris Carter was inspired by this series, but having watched most all of both series I'm led more to think that Carter actually ripped off a lot elements of this series (many examples come to mind, such as the Kolchak episode with the dark-haired vampire woman in LA, that stuck me as very similar to an X-files episode, but I digress.)  Darrin McGavin makes this series: he's goofy, lovable and clumsy enough to lead you into a sense of security and then the show sneaks up with some creepy element and gives you a jump (very well done in the doppleganger episode.)  I've noticed that the series fluctuated between being excellent and cheesy, with the ape-creatures and giant lizard being some of the sillier creatures of the series, so you have to take all of this with a grain of salt.

Although I don't mind watching older TV shows and movies, even black and whites, I found this show actually boring and didn't really care for the character. All he cared about was getting a story, not even caring if the bad guy was getting away, as long as he got a picture. My 12 yr old son thought it was boring too but my mother, born in the 50's still enjoyed it. I personally won't watch anymore of them unless forced to by my mother.",1389139200,,858,3.9653179190751446

2170596,5,B00066FPCG,this series is were everything started  and it was great I remember it scared the s*** out of me as a kid.and to be able to see it all over again........ Priceless,1388448000,,163,4.09375
2170597,2,B00066FPCG,"I had a great fondness for this series as a teenager, and was excited to purchase the ""boxed set"" at a reasonable price to see if my fond memories were justified.

They weren't, really. Although Darrin McGavin gamely mugs his way through these episodes and there are some funny characters and dialogue, the level of production and storytelling are pretty dismal.  The producers simply didn't have the budget to live up to their story ambitions.

As with its eighties successor, the X-files, the stories invariably open with someone being killed by some malevolent creature or force--often unseen because the special effects are inadequate. Then Kolchak arrives,  somehow breezes into the crime scene (even though he is reviled by the authorities) often picking up the murder weapon or body parts as if he were browsing in a discount store, consults with a few experts, eventually pieces together what we in the audience have long ago guessed, and then runs afoul of either the police, the government, or Vincenzo, all of whom are trying to cover up whatever Kolchak has uncovered.  Finally, there's a confrontation in a dark room in which Kolchak either vanquishes the creature, or appeases it in some way so that it disappears again into the night.

The specifics of the stories are just unbelievably weak. As an example, look at the episode about the underground, bipedal alligator:  Kolchak does things like break into a locked room by tapping on the door with a geologist's hammer. The door has a latch and a padlock, Kolchak has the hammer in his hand, but they couldn't even bother to film an insert of him prying off the hasp or some such thing.  Instead, he just gives the door a few taps and pushes it open. In another episode, Kolchak has barricaded himself in a room against a knight in armor.  The knight chops through the door with a battle axe, and because the dresser that Kolchak has used to barricade the door falls over onto his leg, Kolchak loses consciousness.  I mean, they couldn't even bother to stage the scene so that something would fall on McGavin's head--you know, the usual prerequisite for being knocked out.  Things like that can't really be blamed on the budget. They're just. . . lazy.

David Chase, who wrote many of the episodes and is credited as a story consultant, is great with tone and dialogue, but in my opinion is not  a particularly great plotter.

But some of the dialogue exchanges and characters are still funny.  And I love Gil Mele's theme and the scores. But the whole thing is pitched at such an odd, semi-comic level that--at least in the four or five episodes I've now re-watched--the series never captures any of the suspense or thrills of the original TV movie.  For me, the humor that I remembered so fondly undercuts all the suspense.

And as many other people here have mentioned, the presentation of this boxed set is terrible. The picture looks grainy and is so dark as to be unwatchable in many scenes. Sometimes the picture just freezes up and I have to re-start the DVD.

A lot of people have said that this series deserves better treatment but after re-watching four or five episodes, I'm not so sure.",1388448000,,3165,4.744525547445256
2170598,4,B00066FPCG,"I like this series for being so hammy and predictable.  It is pure entertainment.  Although McGavin stated that he hated making this series, I have always enjoyed it.

2170603,4,B00066FPCG,"Cheesy, funny, and scary. All of these things sum up the Kolchak series. If your into old school B movies and tv shows from the 1970s don't pass this series. Darren McGavin is funny and sarcastic as the truth driven Kolchak. A man so obsessed with getting the story he is willing to battle the police, his boss and supernatural menaces in order to get it.

 Lots of guest stars from classic movies and TV pop up in the series so its fun seeing what role they play. If you're into the X-Files this series is considered an inspiration for it by the creators.

If I have one complaint about the DVD set its that it doesn't include the two TV movies that were the precursors to the series (The Night Stalker and The Night Strangler) Though if you hunt around a bit online you can find them both on a DVD Double Feature disk.

The DVDs in this set itself are double sided and each side contains four episodes. I would have preferred single sided disks but beggers can't be choosers.

Still despite my these minor issues I highly recommend this set.",1386288000,,1043,4.383419689119171

Disregard the haters who blame the transfer quality. I would have preferred single sided disks but these double sided discs play fine. Most of the action in this series takes place in dark settings, much at night so you have to expect a less than perfect viewing quality at times. If you use an HDMI hookup from your player to your HDTV set you will upconvert the picture signal to near high definition, not 720p but roughly around 600p which is perfectly fine to view. The picture quality is as good, or even better, than the single sided disks that are available from Netflix for rental.

2170612,5,B00066FPCG,"Thrilled to own this fabulous series. What this show had in spades was atmosphere! I wanted to make a note regarding something I discovered when watching the two original movies that aired prior to the show becoming a series. I watched the T.V. series back when it first aired in the 70's, but I did not have any recollection of the two made for T.V. movies that started the series. Either I never saw them as a kid or I just couldn't recall them. Anyway, I own and have viewed the two movies as an adult and they are excellent. The whole time I viewed the two movies I kept thinking,""something is missing?"" I figured out what is missing is the excellent score by Gil Melle'. In the series this score opens the credit of the show, but is also interspursed through out the show. It is one of the things that really makes the show. I wish they could take the two original movies and add this fantastic score. Everything others have mentioned are what make this a great program: the Micky Spellane, Sam Spade, narration by Kolchak during the show, the humor, the truly eerie moments, did I mention atmosphere!, the writing was really smart also. The photography was also excellent, check out the opening scene of ""The Spanish Moss Murders,"" you are right in the front seat of the car with Kolchak cruising thru the city.

2170647,3,B00066FPCG,"Today Darren McGavin (1922-2006) is best recalled as the grumpy father in the classic 1983 A CHRISTMAS STORY, but he was a hardworking character actor with a long list of credits, and in the 1970s he was likely best known for his role in the television KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER.  The series ran twenty episodes on ABC in 1974-1975 season, but according to television lore McGavin was already disenchanted with the writing by the time he filmed the second episode.  The series had a loyal following, but it wasn't a ratings winner, and ABC was not unhappy when Gavin asked to be released at the end of the season.

The series arose from a then-unpublished novel and two made-for-television movies based on it, both starring McGavin as Kolchak, a Chicago newspaper reporter who seems to have a knack for getting involved in supernatural unpleasantnesses.  These include Jack the Ripper, zombies, space aliens, vampires, werewolfs, ghosts, a moss monster, and even the devil itself.  McGavin, it was said, felt the whole thing was basically a ""monster of the week"" show, and it is easy to see why he complained about the writing: there is lots and lots of filler and the stories don't often hang together in any consistent sort of way.  The episodes were designed to fit into an hour slot with commercials, so they generally run about fifty minutes per title.

The big thing you should know about KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER is that it strove for a certain sense of humor that today reads as a mixture of cheesey and campy.  It's the sort of thing that is accidentally funny, unintentionally comic, and occasionally to the level of eye-rolling and head-shaking.  The characters are quick-sketch stereotypes, each with immediately identifiable glitches (Kolchak, for instance, always wear the same rumpled suit and ugly hat and drives a yellow convertable.)  You can tell it was influential, with THE X-FILES an obvious case in point, but it's pretty hokey stuff.

The DVD collection, which includes all twenty episodes, doesn't have anything in the way of extras--but the elements are pretty good.  If your taste runs to 1974 television hokum, you'll have a good time.  If not ... well, nobody will tell if you pass it by.

Since it was a favorite TV of my teen-aged years I instantly invited myself over to watch a couple of episodes and when I got home I quickly made sure I disseminated a couple of hints to my sister that this would make a great Christmas present (she said the first hint was fairly obvious and the second was almost overkill).

Kolchak: The Night Stalker is the complete series of the 1974 television series starring Darren McGavin. The premise of this TV series was that Carl Kolchak, a Chicago based reporter for the Independent News Service (INS) which seems to be on the lowest level of journalism that is either a reporters first or last job, INS seems to be Kolchaks last chance. He inadvertently keeps running into supernatural explanations for murders that at first seem innocuous and ordinary until Kolchak starts to dig deeper into the story. Simon Oakland plays his overwrought boss Tony Vincenzo who wishes and tries to get Kolchak to get in the story he assigned him.

In the course of his investigations Kolchak has run-ins with headless motorcyclists, a witches coven in the fashion industry, robots who have gained sentiency, American Indian Gods, lizard creatures living in the sewers and a werewolf on a cruise ship. The Night Stalker is also host to a whos who of 70s actors, Eric Estrada, Jamie Farr, Larry Storch, Dick Van Patten, Larry Linville, Antonio Fargas, Cathy Lee Crosby, Jim Backus and few others youll know on sight but not their names such as John Fiedler.

The Night Stalker is famously noted as the inspiration behind Chris Carters The X-Files but you can also find ideas that would get a more fully played out in 80s movies, disturbing Indian burial grounds (Poltergeist), a dead arsonist who possess people as they sleep (A Nightmare on Elm Street), cells from the Antarctic begin to grow when accidentally thawed (The Thing), although the producers did have a relationship with Richard Matheson who wrote the original story The Thing is based on.

Some of the monsters look kind of campy, they did even in 1974, but the producers kept them in the dark, literally, low lighting to overcome the campiness of the creatures, but on DVD it only detrimentally affects two of the episodes. The one really element lacking is a special features side it would have been cool to have an interview with Darren McGavin or some of the others associated with the show. Kolchak: The Night Stalker was always fun to watch and light a childs imagination and the stories still hold up today (despite low TV production values) and I found myself still being entertained.",1361577600,3,2741,4.776371308016878

always skeptical. Hugely entertaining, even today. No cell phones, no computers, no word processors or IT professionals; just great stories and acting.

2170662,5,B00066FPCG,"This was a great occult/mystery series in the 1970's Darren McGavin's Karl Kolchak was an intrepid (And Irritating) reporter with a 'nose for news' and trouble! He always seemed to stumble across some of the most bizarre cases and annoy the police with his 'Fantastic' stories about everything from ghosts to witches to murderers who were several hundred years old. Throw in a few Gods, Demons and Indian legends come to life add a 'secret government project' gone awry and you get the general idea as to why he annoyed the authorities of the time who wanted to keep such things under wraps and out of the general public's knowledge. The only negatives were the 'Over The Top' performance of Lara Parker of 'Dark Shadows' fame as a black witch (similar to her Angelique role in 'Shadows) that seemed a little too campy and out of place on a show that took the occult theme somewhat seriously and the general lack of any 'real' research on any of the subjects presented. The show would have benefitted from a more 'scientific' approach - maybe a contact or researcher friend who had a background in general science who could help figure things out - you really couldn't believe Kolchak just stumbled onto the solution in every episode or was smart enough to figure it out every time.

P.S. I also wanted to state that like some shows for ABC it started out as a couple of 'Television Specials' with the movies being 're-edited' into two episodes of the T.V. series. This was done frequently by ABC in the 1970's to give them material for their 'Movie Of The Week' and avoid paying for 'Pilot' Films for shows.",1358640000,,1608,4.6421052631578945

2170671,4,B00066FPCG,"Long ago and far away, i used to actually have to walk to the television to turn it on.  As far back as it aired, this show was highly original.  Decades before The X-Files reeled us geeks in, this program addressed swamp monsters, vampires and zombies.  Darrin McGavin approached each incident of the unexplained under the guise of the reporter working for  a second rate newspaper.  His wit and cynicism was never appreciated by the cops and city officials, of course.  He was regularly joined by his hard nosed Italian boss, an elderly ""agony aunt"" columnist and a prissy brown-noser.  The show's characters did not, however, fall into stereotypes.  It was funny and the writing was sharp.  Each episode is very good in encapsulating what is normally a two hour movie (anybody remember those wonderful movies of the week?).  The DVD quality is fairly good, considering they are double sided.  I would have given this set five stars had it included the Carol Lynley Night Stalker movie, as I enjoy her work and that was a very well produced segment.  Fans of seventies science fiction/adventure should pick up this box set.  More people need to become familiar with Darrin McGavin's work.",1355788800,2,1190,4.8606965174129355

2170677,4,B00066FPCG,"At the age of 9 or 10, having enjoyed the James Blish novelizations of ""Star Trek,"" I wrote to Jeff Rice, the author of the original Night Stalker novel, for permission to novelize ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker.""  He referred me to David Chase at Universal Studios, so I sent him a request as well (hand-written in pencil in my best cursive).  I received a gracious refusal, in which he thanked me for being a fan but informed me that at that time there were no plans for any books based on the show.  Unfortunately, I no longer have that letter, but I still have many fond memories of watching the series.

Revisiting it as an adult, I was pleased at how well many of the episodes hold up.  Darren McGavin is great as the wise-acre reporter Kolchak and is the primary reason for the show's success, although Simon Oakland and Jack Grinnage must be recognized as well.  As sorry as I was to see it go, I now think that it is just as well that it ended when it did, as the quality of the writing definitely declined over the course of the season and the monster-of-the-week format became a bit preposterous.  However, before the ignominious end, in which Kolchak faced off against a man in a ridiculous reptile costume, there were a run of great episodes.  Standouts include ""The Ripper"" (Jack the Ripper!), ""The Zombie"" (self-explanatory!), and ""Horror in the Heights"" (an East Indian demon, scripted by Hammer Studios veteran Jimmy Sangster).  It's also fun to see the many character actors who are familiar faces to anyone who was watching TV in the 70s, including the great Keenan Wynn in a recurring role.",1352160000,,1607,4.610526315789474

This is way too cool!!!",1351468800,,332,4.409836065573771
2170679,2,B00066FPCG,"Note: I updated my original review and upgraded the rating as I finally watched more than the first few episodes so I have a more full picture of this release now.
Originally I rated it one star but now have upped it to two.

I used to like this TV show when it was originally broadcast when I was 12 years old.  But then again, I was only 12.

Whether or not anyone likes the series doesn't matter; this is among the WORST DVD sets I have ever purchased.  This is NOT a quality DVD transfer.  It could
have been done way better.

The series itself was at times fun and campy but like the original ""Dark Shadows"" sloppy acting, writing and production come through.  Sometimes the acting
is really bad and trying to make Hitchcock and Serling maneuvers poorly executed is just plain laughable.  Often when a monster attacks, a freeze frame occurs
then you get a little audio, then the scene ends.  They must have been going for a 'G' rating but since it was broadcast originally past ""Prime Time"" at 10:00
on Friday nights (then later changed to 8:00 as per wikipedia), it seems unnecessary.

In fact the series had such low ratings and was so poorly executed, it didn't even last ONE full season before getting cancelled at 20 episodes when the main actor,
Darrin McGavin quit.  He wasn't a bad actor but he wasn't the best, either.  He did have a likeable personality and does fit this role for what it is.

Other reviewers have panned the video quality and I can only AGREE with them 100%.  I should have listened to them more before purchasing it, as I was influenced by
a prevalence of glowing reviews from many more others.

Not only this isn't any better than an amateur home video transfer from VHS tapes to a DVD, with graininess, at times the darkness of the video in night-time scenes
sucks all the enjoyment out of watching it.  Also at many times the video and audio are out of sync which is EXTREMELY ANNOYING!

Now for the positives; it can be a fun campy series to watch but really isn't that great even for camp.  It can be just downright stupid sometimes, but that
can be part of the fun.  McGavin was a good choice for this role.  There are many guest appearances by many supporting and B-grade actors/actresses seen in many movies
and series of the 1950s-80s, with a handful still alive and active.  Many you don't know by name seem familiar because most of these people made guest appearances in
many TV shows of the era.  It is fun to bring up some websites about movies & television and trace the histories of the guest actors while watching it.  But for some
episodes, that is the only real fun.  You can't help but to compare it to the series ""Love Boat"" for a similar experience with guest appearances.  In fact, a number
of the guest actors did appear on ""Love Boat"" as well!

Overall, not highly recommended except to nostalgia buffs and fans of really weak campy horror flicks.",1350864000,3,2905,4.464895635673624

2170687,5,B00066FPCG,"If you remember this as a kid, you may find this a fun trip down memory lane. However, like some have said, sometimes, people wonder if they should've left their memories in the past and not revisited what scared them at age 5, since those films will appear stupid and bad as an adult. That's the nostalgic's dilemma, always. But if you enjoy regressing to 70s badness, this will appeal to you. It's also proof that the old rule of what you don't see is scarier than what you do- there are some dumb effects here that are laughable.

Also, it is very dark, literally; I don't know if that's due to a poor transfer, as others have complained, or partly due to the fact that it was likely photographed in very dark lighting for a spooky effect and the limitations of the times, and the budgets, produced a flat effect visually. You can see how dark photography also influenced its thematic offspring, ""The X Files"", where the photography technology was miles above technically and you get much more depth of field and complexity of imagery.

This is probably of interest to fans of this particular genre, but not to horror fans in general. If you want a good scare, you won't find much here, especially if you are accustomed to CGI, and Blue-Ray/hi-def etc etc. you will likely be frustrated by the poor quality. But if you're like me and you grew up watching low-fi stuff, you might have some fun with this.

Also, Darren McGavin's cliched yet fun gumshoe act saves the day; his personality really carries this show.

Post-script: I have re-watched more of this and how could I have only given it 3 stars? This is the bomb. Sure, it's not quite scary but so entertaining and it has that weird early 70s feel to it; my inner child squeals with glee watching stuff that was so hard to get permission to watch when I was little. It was also pretty risque for its time- lots of hookers, massage parlors, etc. This is sort of like ""Streets of San francisco meets Night Gallery."". TV has not been this great since; the era just had its own feel that can't be replicated. Also, I find the lack of gore a relief from the gross-outs on TV now. What would've been an R movie in the 70s is on Criminal Minds (which I like) and CSI all the time. It just gets disgusting, stressful, and a little too close to the sickness of the real world to be entertaining. This show is so removed from reality that it's pure joy.

The snappy dialogue is also very fun; and again, Darren McGavin is perfect, even if they never gave him more than one suit to wear. It's also interesting that McGavin was a noir actor, and his boss was the Dr. in ""Psycho"", so they bring pedigree to what could've been a really bad show had it been handled wrong.

The over all quality of the transfers are a notch below the Night Stalker-Night Strangler movie DVD but it is not so inferior as to harm the viewing experience of the these DVD's. After all, we are not watching National Geographic movies of stunning vista's, we are watching an old 70's TV series. I would highly recommend buying the TV series and have fun watching.

This was a good series...I guess Universal Studios hasn't heard of quality control?",1328054400,5,514,4.65934065934066
2170697,5,B00066FPCG,I don't believe I could have been more thrilled when I saw they had released Kolchak: The Night Stalker on a DVD box set. I loved the show way back when it was on TV in the 70's and I am finding I still love the series today as I have been watching each episode. Darren McGavin was a perfect choice for the role as Kolchak. He certainly seemed to enjoy every minute of appearing in it. And Simon Oakland as his suffering over ulcered boss made a great co-star. They both played off each other brilliently. There are no extra features which is a bummer but ok. At least the series is out on DVD.,1325808000,4,594,4.129310344827586
2170698,5,B00066FPCG,"I cannot deny that the special effects can be laughable. And the storylines occasionally formulaic.

But the characters!  I love it for the characters, and chief of these, of course, is Darren McGavin's title character, the intrepid and rumpled reporter, Carl Kolchak, who makes you laugh even when he's not trying to. Arguing with his boss, arguing with the police, bravely following monsters into old houses and sewers and what not. He never gives up. And all the time Kolchak insists that the public has the right to know if there is a monster among them.  Each episode ends with Kolchak speaking into his miniature tape recorder, warning anyone who might be willing to listen, such as: ""Try and tell yourself, it couldn't happen here.""  Just try!

Before the TV series, there were two made-for TV movies, ""The Night Stalker"" and ""The Night Strangler"". These aren't included with this TV series set; I have them combined on a separate single DVD. The first movie aired on ABC on January 11, 1972, and it was the highest rated TV movie up to that time. The sequel aired about a year later.

Then, in 1974, we finally see the series, 20 weekly episodes were shot and aired.

We fans couldn't understand why it was cancelled, but the facts are clear. Out of eighty-four series airing on TV during the 1974-75 season, ""Kolchak"" ratings finished in 74th place.  [""All in the Family"" was the top show that season.]

If you'd like more background about the show, I recommend ""Night Stalking: A 20th Anniversary Kolchak Companion"", by Mark Dawidziak. Originally published in 1991, Dawidziak interviewed McGavin (who was also executive producer), Jeff Rice (creator, author of original books), Dan Curtis (producer) and Richard Matheson (screenwriter extraordinaire). In addition, he talked to directors, writers, composers, guest stars, and TV critics.

For example, David Bianculli, TV critic for the New York Post, had this to say about episode #2, ""The Zombie"": ""More than fifteen years later, I still feel squeamish  thinking about Kolchak crawling through a car graveyard trying to pour salt into the zombie's mouth and then sewing its lips shut before it could wake up. You're watching and watching and then the zombie's eyes opened!""

2170699,4,B00066FPCG,"I bought the series since I was hooked as a child.  Thank God it aired on Friday so I wouldn't have to worry about being sent to bed before the episode ended.  The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that the original TV movie that started it all wasn't included in the boxed set. Still, a Saturday afternoon Kolchak marathon is most enjoyable!!!  Amazon, why isn't the movie available for rent(as much as I loved it, I don't love it enough to pay that kind of money to buy the DVD)?",1318204800,2,492,4.268817204301075
2170700,3,B00066FPCG,"I was a huge fan of Kolchak back in the day.  The creep factor, in a darkened room each Friday night, was substantial.  Unfortunately, it doesn't hold up too well 30+ years later.  The best episodes are 'Horror in the Heights', 'The Vampire' and 'The Spanish Moss Murders'.  The rest are pretty mediocre...some are laughable camp...some are downright B-A-D.  'Chopper' is notable for being written by Robert Zemekis and for having perhaps the funniest premise of the series...a zombie motorcyclist from beyond the grave returns to behead former biker gang members.  No, I'm not kidding.",1317945600,,586,5.11578947368421
2170701,3,B00066FPCG,"As many a fan here, ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" was my first favorite prime time TV program (unless ""Wonderful World of Disney"" can be counted, which aired before 7PM on Sundays). I was 9 years old & many shows on TV, since the 60s, had become adult themed. However, 1974 saw the debuts of ""Little House on the Prairie"", ""Planet of the Apes"", ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" (which cost me from seeing many an episode of ""Planet -""), ""Kung Fu"", ... and this one.
But I still had to fight to see ""Night Stalker"", even though it was on @ 9PM on Fridays, opposite only ""Police Woman"". Needless to say, the series quickly became a bit long in the tooth, dragging a bit (& I was only 9) & the better episodes didn't really start popping up until after a month - and then it was pretty much every other one (however, on dvd, without commercials, the pace isn't too bad). The writing's quite good, @ times, especially the banter between the two lead characters, newspaper reporter Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) and his editor Tony Vincenzo (Simon Oakland). Some episodes are even near brilliant (such as my favorite, ""Horror in the Heights""), quite creepy (including my other favorite, ""Fire Fall"", as well as ""The Vampire"" & ""The Spanish Moss Murders""), or tend to offer a feeling of dread (""The Devil's Platform"", ""The Zombie"", ""Demon in Lace"").
For the most part, Darren McGavin's portrayal of the witty, ironic, bumbling wordsmith Kolchak makes the show, even in its lesser moments and, although it can definitely bog down with too much dialogue and little action, I thought nearly 50% of the series was decent, if not quite good (though the 1974 episodes are better than the spring '75 ones). There are those childhood memories that can be better left as a memory (several of mine, it turns out), but then there are those that are surprisingly alright.
I'm happy to report that this is one of them that holds up. If you're looking for some creepy fun, this one can deliver. I watched it with my wife this year, leading into October, the spookiest month of the year - and we were both hauntingly pleased.
 *(NOTE: Some things sadly don't hold up - & in this case, it would be my memory of the ""edge-of-your-seat"" climaxes, which turn out to only work on a couple of these - but I still encourage a look.)",1317081600,2,2299,4.580097087378641
2170702,3,B00066FPCG,"Because of the way the product was presented, I assumed I was purchasing the original television movie rather than the series.  That said, Darren McGavin is perfect in the role of Kolchak and some of the episodes are quite good.  None, however, measure up to the original, set in Las Vegas and having the viewer share Kolchak's skepticism about what supernatural happenings.  Would still like to find the original tv movie.",1316908800,,423,4.929577464788732

Double sided dvds, no problem for me, I mean, its like the old 1998 Anchor Bay release of the two tv pilots of ""The Night Stalker/The Night Strangler"" tv movies not like the 2004 MGM individual dvd releases( that you will want to get, somehow, without spending a fortune for something that is in short supply).

2170708,4,B00066FPCG,"In the mid-1970s, ""The X Files"" was called ""The Night Stalker"" (TNS).  Now a show that far ahead of its time couldn't exist for long in the mediocre milieu of network television, but for one brief year, we were treated to one of the greatest characters ever to inhabit TV Land.

All week, I would wait for the night the show came on, and if my homework was finished and my chores completed, I could try to talk my way past my mom's objections that ""It'll give you nightmares!"" (Which it did, but they were a small price to pay.) Now if we're being honest, I'll have to admit that the quality of the scripts (not to mention the special affects) was wildly uneven. But when it was good, it was magical! And even when the episode's plot left something to be desired, the relationship between Kolchak and his boss, Anthony Vincenzo (played to perfection by Simon Oakland), made every minute worthwhile.

If ever a series revolved around an anti-leading man, TNS was that series. Carl Kolchak wasn't young, handsome, or suave, and he worked for a two-bit, perpetually broke news service. A real old-school reporter, he was cynical and hard-bitten, and his prose tended toward the florid. His suit was always rumpled, and his shoes were worn. He always seemed to be in a hurry, yet he always arrived late and out of breath. In any fight, he was sure to get the worst of it.

In other words, he was far from the glamorous, polished hero image usually found in TV's mystery shows. Which made him real! Every week I would root for him to find one--just one--person that would believe his incredible stories ... but just try to get someone to take you seriously when you're talking about vampires or werewolves! Even the cops, staring the evidence in the face, were loathe to admit to anything, even away from the public eye.

Mr. Vincenzo, Kolchak's boss, was always harried and hounded to the verge of a nervous breakdown by the stress of trying to keep his tiny bureau out of bankruptcy while simultaneously pleasing his bosses in New York. All Tony ever wanted was a little peace and quiet, a good night's sleep, and a smooth-running operation. With Kolchak on his staff, however, those were all as rare as high-quality photographs of an alien or the devil.

Long before Moonlighting's conflict-energized dialogues between Sybill and Bruce, Tony and Carl could go at it with the best of them--and always at the top of their lungs. Kolchak usually managed to get the best of his boss, who was always threatening to fire the troublesome reporter ""if that story isn't on my desk first thing in the morning!""  Instead, he was much more likely to get a 3 a.m. call from the local police precinct, pleading for him to come down and post bail. Because Kolchak's main characteristics were persistence, an open mind, and incredible curiosity--none of which endeared him to local law
enforcement. The police brass was always trying to cover up the uncomfortable details that Kolchak was determined to unearth ... and he wanted them to admit things that would get them thrown in a loony bin.

Kolchak is a dying breed. On one hand, TV News was already outbidding print services for talent, and on the other Woodward and Bernstein were about to revolutionize reporting. Soon, reporters would no longer dream of a big scoop on the latest sensational murder; instead, it was to become all about politically themed exposes ... who can take down the biggest politician.

But Carl Kolchak was a great character, foibles and all, and Darren McGavin played him spot on, note for note. So it may have lasted a mere 20 episodes ... but what a show!",1300492800,3,3621,4.680817610062893

  This story takes place in a scenario precisely written for such a fantastic tale, during a Cubs vs Tigers world series matchup...yeah, I said the Cubs! The action intensifies as People start dissapearing and dying-apparently caused from having the bone marrow sucked from their lifeless bodies same as with the zoo animals. Kolchak soon realizes that the culprit is not of this Earth but actually a stranded visitor from another star system but this ET is by no means friendly and its up to Carl to get to the bottom of this mystery before the body count climbs higher. He tries his best dispite the best efforts of the local embattled police chief Quill(James Gregory-""Manchurian Candidate""/Beneath the Planet of the Apes"") and various government agencies to silence him. Another well written episode with a fine supporting cast with James Gregory as the police chief, Dick Van Patten as a complaining tax payer and Mary Wickes as Dr. Bess Winestock, a zoo biologist investigating the animal deaths.
  The episode was co-written by series creator Jeff Rice and in a creative and cost efficient choice the alien visitor is never seen, seemingly invisible to the human eye but it's ship is seen near the end of the episode-good action sequences and pacing make this one of the better written and performed episodes of the series short 2 season run.",1292976000,,1636,5.025830258302583
2170715,3,B00066FPCG,"I was just a kid when the original ""Night Stalker"" series debuted on television and granted nowadays with all sorts of lurid and graphic material on the airwaves this series would seem rather tame in comparison, but of course it was a different time back then. The series was short lived only lasting two years but in those two short seasons there were a handful of entertaining episodes; ""Horror in the Heights"" was one of these. Kolchak stumbles on a series of seemingly innocuous deaths involving the elderly in an old downtown neighborhood in Chicago. Old age/ natural causes being lableled as the primary cause of the deaths by the local police and Mes doesn't quite convince the curious INS reporter Kolchak. He soon discovers that it is actually a creature doing the gruesome killings, a mythological demon called a Rikshassa which has the power to cloud it's victims minds by taking on the appearance of someone they know and trust-allowing the victim to let down their guard momentarily and ultimately defensless against it's savagery. Kolchak also discovers that he is not alone in the quest of this ""monster"", an old Hindu holy man is also hunting him but his mind and body are to weak to continue the hunt.
  Relunctantly Kolchak takes up the quest to rid the neighborhood of this flesh eating abomination, crossbow in hand with bolts blessed by Rama he finally confronts the Rikshassa face to face but unsuspectingly it takes the form of one of his trusted co-workers-will he see through the creatures guise or will he become yet another hapless victim of the creatures ravenous hunger.
  The story was a good one although a bit lacking in detail, one comes away wanting to see more of the creature and about the myth of the Rikshassa, pretty good acting all around, a little more work on the creature would have been welcome but then again the series was on a modest budget during it's short run.
 Looking back, my main problem with episodes like this one and the series as a whole was that they were too short-in hindsight they would have been much better as a series of two hour TV movies much like how the series was started with the premier of two, ninety minute telefilms (""the Night Stalker"" and it's follow up ""the Night Strangler""). Although the series and it's stars have long since departed us, the memories are still there and reminds us that a good spook story doesn't necessarily have to be painted in technicolor accurate ""blood"" red to scare us...",1292976000,,2476,4.7354988399071924

2170724,5,B00066FPCG,"I just found some interesting trivia about KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER that I never knew (and I see some other reviewers have mentioned it too).

David Chase, who would go on to create one of the greatest shows on TV, THE SOPRANOS, got his first Hollywood job as a story editor for THE NIGHT STALKER!  Not only that, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale (USED CARS, BACK TO THE FUTURE) wrote one of THE NIGHT STALKER's wildest episodes, ""Chopper,"" a modern-day update of the headless horseman legend (only now he rides a motorcycle).

This was my favorite show as a kid.  The TV movies were written by Richard Matheson, who wrote I AM LEGEND, HELL HOUSE, and my favortie TWILIGHT ZONE episode, ""Nightmare at 30,000 Feet.""

Although this series would lapse into a ""Monster of the Week"" formula that exhausted its concept (something THE X-FILES learned to avoid), the show itself did a great job of developing the office and its quirky reporters around the supernatural goings-on.  Vincenzo the screaming boss with an ulcer, ""Uptight"" the snooty rival, Miss Emily the doting grandmotherly presence.  And Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak, a wise-guy reporter who believes more in the paranormal than the business-as-usual beauracrats he's forced to deal with.

I was very pleased by the DVD set. The episodes are intact and I got to watch several that I've never seen before. It was also interesting to see how reporting used to be done... you had to get out from behind your big steel desk and go to the library or go to the morgue or find a subject matter expert. You had to develop photos and print them. You put stories ""on the wire"" so it could be picked up by news services via teletype. I don't think you could do the Night Stalker today. In this way it's as if it's preserved in amber.

Sure, some of the special effects were hokey back then (I recall how incredibly unconvincing the headless biker was) but the stories made up for them. Of course, you had to wonder why these things always happened to Kolchak and how he managed not to end up in jail for destruction of public property, slander, misuse of a body, public nuisance, impersonating a doctor, etc. etc.

Definitely worth watching!",1246838400,2,1146,4.247706422018348

2170728,3,B00066FPCG,"Like many people who also wrote reviews, I wish I could give this DVD set 5 stars.  Kolchak: The Night Stalker itself warrants 4, with one star being deducted for sometimes predictable writing and underwhelming production value (though maybe not for its age).  However, that's a small price to pay for a show that exuded such charm, even if the presentation is so bad it deserves to be docked another.

Yes, the transfer is bad.  Yes, there are no special features.  Yes, it's hard to see sometimes (The Ripper especially).  Nothing new here.  But I saw this show in syndication back in high school (I'm 26) and fell in love with its campy, dated vibe.  The poor image quality, in a queer way, added to its mystique.  Yes, the FX can be bad and the image grainy, but there's a distinct vintage aesthetic here that drew me in, and it's no worse than I remember on TV so it wasn't a shock, just a disappointment that so little effort was taken to clean it up.

One of the things that stands out most about K:TNS is its somewhat timeless motif.  There's a mixture of '40's noir, ageless fable, '50's paranoia, '60's/'70's psychidelics, and innocent fascination with the supernatural--pessimistic optimism at its finest.  Kolchak often has fast-paced banter with harried editor, Tony Vincenzo, fellow columnist Ron ""Uptight"" Updyke, and a slew of informants, passersby, experts, witnesses and whoever is playing the ""law"" that week.  Mad Dog and the Vegas officer in ""The Vampire"" stand out.  Kolchak's rare moments of compassion or anything that doesn't involve himself and his obsessive quests are usually shared with the elderly Miss Emily, drawing out snapshots of his humanity.  And therein lies one of the few flaws:

Kolchak is pretty much an Aspie.  His borderline OCD can cease to be charming and start to be a turnoff if you've ever known anyone like him in real life.  But aside from that little personal hangup, he's pretty awesome.  They want you to laugh at Ron Updyke but on more than one occasion I found myself feeling bad for him.  Not that he's that likeable of a character to begin with though.  Despite his personality defects, Kolchak has moments where he reveals himself to be a fairly conservative person simply out for the truth, someone who is willing to be a seer for the truth and a sucker for its consequences.

The ""police officer of the week"" characters are pretty stock and standard and only slightly less varied than the ""monster of the week"".  Still, they get a pass for always providing entertaining exchanges with Kolchak, especially in ""The Knightly Murders"".  And who could neglect to mention two of the greatest characters of all: Kolchak's straw hat and seersucker suit?

Sometimes the editing suffers and you miss seeing a particular murder or something isn't framed right, though studio censorship played a large role in that at the time of filming.  Every now and then the sound is subpar, but a lot of this may be attributed to mid-70's technology and/or Universal's apathetic transfer.

And that's pretty much it for the negatives.  Just about everything else here is really enjoyable.  Yes, this show was a precursor to The X-Files.  But it's more than that, better than that.  Take all the lighthearted fun and camp of every X-Files episode and distill it, you might get half a season's worth of material.  But each episode of Kolchak is concentrated charm.

The joy of K:TNS was that it rarely took itself THAT seriously.  It was out to have fun, which makes it imminently more watchable.  One of the things I found refreshing was the legitimacy it gave the supernatural.  In an age that idolizes science's dogma too much (to the point of being a real downer), it's nice to see a show hang on to the what-if's, if for nothing else than a jolt and a laugh.  The air of mystery is never threatened.  You can count on aliens really being aliens, vampires really being vampires, and Satanic senators from Chicago with aspirations for the White House really being in league with the Prince of Darkness.  The en vogue atheism of today is absent in this time capsule show, and that's a blessing.  Yes, it did devolve into a ""monster the week"" cavalcade, but with only 20 episodes there wasn't too much time to devote to an overarcing plot.  Maybe this formula was doomed to be short-lived?  How many monsters can you conjure, season after season?  Sadly, we'll never know.

Take this show for what it was: a lighthearted romp through mystery, noir and urban legend, a witty collection of mostly well made episodes whose somewhat stock characters and trappings rarely grow tiresome.  It would be nice if this was rereleased with behind the scenes footage, interviews, commentaries, TV spots, and bios on the show and cast but, alas, there are no such ammenities offered.

If you're a fan of the show or you want to witness original programming that's good for repeated viewings (I STILL have fun watching these even after years of owning the DVD's), then get Kolchak: The Night Stalker, just don't expect any frills or remarkable restoration.  While normally I'd say ""go used"" as a means of depriving the manufacturer of profits on a poor quality item, the idealist in me says ""buy new"" to encourage Universal.  If sales are good they MIGHT someday rerelease the show in a restored transfer with special features.  It'll probably never happen but the only thing that means anything in these scenarios is $$$.

For all its technical flaws and dated showmanship, this box set contains 20 episodes of vintage camp, fantasy charm, and a refreshingly lighthearted take on the supernatural minus the pretentious scientific skepticism that we've seen in shows of this genre for so long.  And if anyone knows what kind of cassette tape recorder he used, let me know.  I'm always on the hunt for reliable vintage electronics.",1244592000,3,5852,4.806806806806807

Heavy on atmosphere, some terrific dialogue, quirky characters, and most importantly, wonderful actors like Simon Oakland and especially the infectiously charming Darren McGavin.

Morrow & Ernie Pyle, just updated to horror school. It's interesting to see the big cars used back then & the fashions. The scripts are intelligent & each episode moves so fast.

2170740,5,B00066FPCG,"Darren McGavin stars as the irrepressible Carl Kolchak, fearless reporter for Chicago's Independent News Service. Ever dressed in seersucker suits and a porkpie hat with a camera and tape recorder slung over his shoulder, Carl shows up everywhere that news is happening, much to the chagrin of the local authorities. Kolchak has a knack for finding the story behind the story, and that story usually has something wrong with it; something that makes it unfit for printing and often puts Kolchak in some very uncomfortable situations. He's faced vampires, werewolves, witches, mummies, zombies, immortals, and more, but his biggest adversaries tend to be the people in charge who keep his stories from getting out to the public.

If you haven't seen the 1974/75 television series ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"", you've really been missing out, especially you ""X-Files"" fans, as this is the show that inspired that whole search for the truth. After two hit TV movies in '72 and '73 (available on a double-feature DVD), Kolchak returned with these weekly adventures that spanned 20 episodes of witty tales of the macabre, pitting Kolchak against a cavalcade of monsters that varied from frightening to ridiculous. As a kid, the Alligator creature from the Sentry episode scared me I think, but today it looks rather like a High School football mascot costume, ha. The show featured guest stars galore, including the lovely Lara Parker of Dark Shadows fame back as a witch whose fits of laughter seem more than a bit excessive. In this DVD set you'll find all 20 episodes with varying picture quality, though it's decent throughout. There are only three discs holding the twenty 44 minute episodes though, meaning they are double-sided (so ya gotta be extra careful with 'em) and a lot of sets have had issues. I had to do a return myself in order to get one in which all the episodes played properly. I bought my younger sister, the X-Files fanatic, a set too, and she didn't have any troubles, thankfully. There are no bonus features, but at least you'll have the whole show with this set. The episodes are as follows:

1. The Ripper: Yep, Jack the Ripper seems to be back alive and in Chicago!
2. The Zombie: A dead man returns for revenge on those who laid him out!
3. They Have Been, They Are, They Will Be...: This is the alien episode. You can really see how X-Files got inspiration from this one!
4. The Vampire: A victim of the first Kolchak TV movie's vampire has returned as the living dead and is now stalking Hollywood!
5. The Werewolf: On a cruise ship, Kolchak runs into a werewolf who enjoys tossing people around.
6. Firefall: If you've ever been curious about dopplegangers (my friend's wife is sure she is being plagued by one), this episode is for you. And there's spontaneous human combustion no less!
7. The Devil's Platform: Tom Skerritt plays a devil-dealing politician to perfection!
8. Bad Medicine: A Native American demon is robbing high-rises of priceless jewels!
9. The Spanish Moss Murders: A Cajun boogeyman is killing people in Chicago, but is it just a dream?
10. The Energy Eater: A Native American Bear God is taking people out for building on his territory.
11. Horror in the Heights: A Hindu demon begins attacking the elderly in a neglected part of town.
12. Mr. R.I.N.G.: Artificial Intelligence turns deadly!
13. Primal Scream: Kolchak goes up against a man-eating ape-man grown out of Antarctic cell samples.
14. The Trevi Collection: The fashion industry is plagued by murders that could only be the work of a model witch.
15. Chopper: When a motorcycle gang member returns from the grave, Kolchak is the only one who cares, as usual.
16. Demon in Lace: A succubus plagues a college campus and causes young men to drop dead.
17. Legacy of Terror: An Aztec cult begins making sacrifices at a fancy hotel, and the final sacrifice will require a mummy's participation.
18. The Knightly Murders: The Black Knight attacks!
19. The Youth Killer: Who knew Helen of Troy was such a terrible person? She's alive and well, and running a very deadly dating service in Chicago.
20. The Sentry: A reptilian creature is tearing apart the workers in an underground facility, and Kolchak is the only one who can stop it!

I used to watch Kolchak reruns late Friday nights on CBS in the '80's as a kid, and I LOVED 'em. Three I have always remembered in particular were the Zombie, werewolf, and alligator-man episodes. I think they just showed them more often or something. They used to give me quite a thrill, and they still do, though it's more because of the smart dialogue and delightful characters nowadays, not to mention the great nostalgic aspect. Though the overall quality of the DVD set varies, I highly recommend it to Kolchak fans and those curious about this awesome show! Trust me, if you've only seen the recent revival series, you ain't seen Kolchak. If I can ever break into the biz and afford to do it, I'd like to do some new Kolchak films and do them right! For now though, there's this set, there's the TV movie double feature DVD, and also some books available on the subject. Don't bother with the short-lived revival series that was trying more to be ""The X-Files"" than ""The Night Stalker"". I also highly recommend the recent Kolchak comic books and graphic novels from Moonstone. Good stuff!",1211500800,2,5338,4.787418655097614

Guests included Phil Silvers, Andrew Prine, Cathy Crosby, William Smith, Eric Braden, John Dehner, Larry Storch and too many to recall.  Sure the effects were sometimes not -- okay hookey.  Richard Kiel covered with moss!  It had a cruise with a passenger who turned into a werewolf.  Invisible aliens who ate the marrow of living creatures.  Mr. R.I.N.G., an artificial intelligence.  An ancient Indian demon who tricks it's victims by appearing as someone they trust.  A hospital built over an Native American demon -- where William Smith, as an Indian shaman, while doing a dance to try and ward off the demon tells Kolchak, ""You put that camera down or you're get a close of the bottom of my shoe.""  Darren McGavin as the down on his luck reporter with the sear-sucker suit, white sneakers and panama hat -- not to mention a camera that would not get a decent picture from further than five feet.

2170744,5,B00066FPCG,"The mid-1970s produced a pair of unlikely hit TV movies, called ""The Night Stalker"" and ""The Night Strangler,"" chronicling the supernatural investigations of a quirky reporter.

And you can guess what happened next -- the TV spinoff ""Kolchak - The Night Stalker"" debuted, reintroducing audience to Carl Kolchak, a threadbare reporter who is working in Chicago. He also has a tendency to bump into ghoulies, ghosties and things that go bump in the night -- all with a tinge of humor and lots of researching.

In this series, Kolchak encounters more than just vampires and serial killers: he battles bizarre aliens and ""missing link"" primates, a possible Jack the Ripper, a call girl returning from the dead, a malevolent doppelganger  causing people to burn to death, and voodoo zombies, haunted armor, succubi, werewolves, demons, killer robots, ghosts and goddesses who are sucking the youth from various attractive young men.

The supernatural is everyday on TV now, with movies and television happily focusing on everything from A (animal spirits) to Z (zombies). But ""Kolchak - The Night Stalker"" has the advantage of being the grandaddy of them all, with a fresh outlook and plots that owe nothing to anyone -- and a delicious black comedy bite to some of its episodes.

While the horror parts can be a bit campy, the originality of its plotlines can't be denied. Sure, it mines everything from Aztec gods to voodoo, Hindu demons to underground lizards -- the latter is the biggest flaw of the series, since it's pretty obviously papier-mache. But it also comes up with plots that no legend could come up with, such as the idea of Helen of Troy still alive and beautiful, and sucking the youth from modern young men.

It also has what few supernatural series have: a sense of humour. There's that entire episode about a headless motorcycle driver -- a modern update of the ""Headless Horseman,"" maybe? And, of course, the brilliant twist of having diabolical help during a political campaign. Seriously, how could some of these politicians -- including certain presidents -- be elected otherwise?

Not to mention the dialogue: we are informed by Kolchak that, ""Captain Leo Winwood and I had a relationship that was long and bloody, like the Crusades, only without the chivalry."" That's not the wittiest line of the series, either.

Darren McGavin -- who twice played a similar character in ""The X-Files"" -- did an excellent job as Carl Kolchak. He plays Kolchak as a crusty, slightly crabby reporter in a white suit and odd hat -- an everyman for the supernatural. He's not handsome, not athletic, not charming, and he rubs the cops the wrong way. Therein lies his rough charm.

The original ""Kolchak - The Night Stalker"" remains a delicious cult classic, and despite some hoky costumes, it still stands up well. Witty, dark and bizarrely original.",1206921600,2,2852,4.949790794979079

2170747,3,B00066FPCG,"This box set captures the 20 episodes of 'Kolchak: The Night Stalker' which aired on ABC-TV for a single season from 1974-75. The late Darren McGavin gave the Carl Kolchak character a unique charm, from the seersucker suit, to the porkpie hat. He was a reporter for a Chicago News Service who developed a knack for getting involved in stories that went out into the fringe - aliens, spirits conjured up by Hindu incantations, headless bikers, murderous mannequins that come to life, zombies and robots.

This all sounds great, and as originally conceived, the series showed promise. The actual execution was plagued by problems, namely McGavin having less control than he expected, plus rushed and shoddy scripts that did not make the best of the sometimes creative conundrums that such a show can offer. By the middle of this single season, McGavin had become outspokenly negative about the whole production, and the quality of the shows took a noticeable dive. ABC put a stake in Night Stalker's heart by spring of 1975.

Despite the problems, some of us have a warm spot in our heart for McGavin's character, and on those occasions when the scripts and production rose to the occasion, this could be a genuinely entertaining affair. Sadly, Universal has added nothing to this set that could have lifted it above a 3-star rating. There are no extras - promos, interviews, or anything that could have added to the set's historical value. Discs are two-sided, and it appears there was no remastering of the picture. It's by no means atrocious, just totally lacking in any sort of sparkle.

Fans of this series can fork over for this - it's all we've got. If you are new to the whole Night Stalker franchise, skip this for the time being and pick up the MGM or Anchor Bay disc containing both TV specials (Night Stalker/Night Strangler). They were truly inspired, from the storytelling to the acting. Broadcast in early 1972 and 1973, they garnered extraordinary ratings and led to green-lighting the series we have in this box set.

There is also a short-lived, but IMHO underrated, 'Night Stalker' revival series, aired in 2005. It was cancelled after a few shows, but the twin DVD collection is well worth a look. Although actor Stuart Townsend did not bring the same charm to his lead role as McGavin did, the storytelling was a notch above what we had in 1974-75. Director Frank Spotnitz was an X-Files veteran, and gave the series a conspiratorial bent, which coupled with dark production, was reasonably satisfying. If you are a new viewer with no sentimental ties to the 70s series, it may well be a better way to spend your money than the ho-hum Universal set here.",1199491200,,2673,4.804347826086956

2170749,5,B00066FPCG,"I watched these as a small child and the passage of time has not diminished the quality of some of the episodes. Yes, in retrospect, there is an element of camp to the series and the effects technologies of the early to mid 70's leave something to be desired but if you take the series as a whole, it is written very well. Unfortunately, much TV today is style and no substance and written by an increasingly younger crowd whose only references are popular culture in and of itself. Night Stalker is a compendium of world mythologies and myths wrapped up in a nice weekly formula. There is also the implication of world behind the one we experience every day. A very compelling idea in the time of Watergate and judging by current events, still a valid world view. Much of the horror and suspense is implied and I suspect that may be what leaves much younger viewers cold. If you've been raised on a diet of gore and CGI based effects this series seems like an antiquarian relic. Some episodes are weaker than others (personally, ""Werewolf"" is campier than ""Chopper"" to me) but the heart of the series is still good storytelling.",1197158400,,1129,4.566502463054187

But when it came out on DVDs, I had to see it because I'd heard so much about it.  It's not hokey at all.  Seeing only glimpses of the monsters is much scarier than seeing some dumb plastic spider like the one in ""It.""  What caught my eye first was the expert and imaginative use of low-level lighting.  I wish some of the movie-makers who are now using available light would look at this show.  You can always see what you need to see.  Kolchak's shabby blue seersucker suit really picks up the light so we can always see what our hero is doing.  If you're looking for stars, you will find stars of the past, present, and future in this series.  And the permanent cast of his co-workers are just perfect.  Then there's the music:  the catchy theme that turns sinister, and the use of different composers and styles in the background music.  And did I mention Chicago?  Just as in the CSI franchises, the city is the star. This show is a class act all the way.  Maybe it was a good thing it was cancelled after one season; it didn't have time to jump the shark.  You need to see it!",1184803200,3,1183,4.191111111111111
2170759,5,B00066FPCG,"By today's special effects it might be subpar, but the storylines, cast and characters were superb. It seems like there were more than 20 episodes to the series [not counting the feature length made for TV movies] but it was only twenty. UNLESS you count McGavin as a reporter in the TV movie ""Hangar Eighteen"" as the 21st episode where he played a ""Kolchak"" character in everything but name, with the storyline following ""The Night Stalker"" theme faithfully.
Of the core group of actors from the series Jack Grinnage is the only one left. He told me of an future episode where his character Ron ""uptight"" Updyke got to be the hero and saved Carl's life, but the series had been cancelled before the episode was shot. And the cancellation got a lot of help from McGavin who wanted to also report on ""normal"" things like crime, and do so in locations besides Chicago.
Jack Grinnage is easy to find, and one of the nicest people you could ever write and get autographed photos from (including The Night Stalker), and a very accompolished actor in his own right-remember ""Rebel Without A Cause"" with James Dean?
All in all I give this series SIX STARS and two bags of microwave popcorn per episode, because it has been the impetus for the X Files, and all the supernatural mediocrity that has spawned since-somehow they just missed the boat [BIG TIME as in QE-2 SIZE].
At least he is back together with his beloved wife Kathie Browne, who appeared in episode 20, ""The Sentry"", once again-and I'm sure they are the featured performers and every Command Performance gets a ""heavenly"" standing ovation.",1183248000,3,1596,4.724014336917563

Honestly, it was better then.  Maybe I grew up, but it wasn't as frightening now, and many of the funny stuff I remember was removed.  In the original shows, it seems Kolchak would tear a page out of the phone book in almost every episode, while tracking down leads.  These have been taken out of all but one episode.

While the new Kolchak: Night Stalker lacks the witty repartee of the old series -- and has less charismatic actors -- the old Kolchak has stood the test of time with its quirky cast and kitschy special effects.

The video quality leaves much to be desired, however. Frequent problems with stopping and/or artifacting proved to be an annoyance, but the content still makes up for the DVD's technical short-comings. The worst part of this whole series was that, sadly, it had to end.

Before I go into my meager review, I will agree with the people who have aforementioned the horrible quality of the print.  In certain episodes, you can hardly notice what the heck is happening on the screen, but then again, maybe its scratchiness gives it a nostalghic feel.

Now about the series:

In a few words I can sum it up and those few words would state ""it is horrible.""  When I was young, it was a treat to stay up and watch the Night Stalker on Friday (or was that Saturday) night as a rerun.  As a kid, I was generally somewhat scared and thought un-natural things were happening.  Now as an adult who was so looking forward to reliving a part of my youth...........as they say, some things are better left in the past.

This series is horrible.  There is not a redeeming quality I can find and give a thumbs up to.  Horrible acting, horrible plots, horrible ideas, horrible everything.  Are you people watching the same series I just did?  I never fast forward even the worse rot, but I had to forward one episode to end my sheer boredom. Is it not amazing that the same blockhead (Kolchak) would constantly run into the same ""supernatural"" threat every episode, even when he is one the Queen Mary!  You can predict what will happen after the first  five minutes on ANY episode, there is no suspense, no twists, nothing to keep the viewer interested.

I now will assume that each reviewer giving this series a rave review is some sci-fi geek who will not be truthful that this piece of garbage is now laughable.  They do not have the courage to admit that what they watched when they were young no longer has any impact or charm.

STAY FAR AWAY",1177459200,5,1872,4.423976608187134
2170766,4,B00066FPCG,"Kolchak was vastly underappreciated in its day. In fact, I don't think I knew anyone else that watched the show in its first run - or at least would admit to watching it. Canceled after only twenty episodes in a Friday night timeslot, it was pretty much forgotten until twenty years later when its basic format became the inspiration for the X-Files. Kolchak was a reporter on the trail of the supernatural. Like murders following Jessica Fletcher in ""Murder She Wrote"", the stories would sometimes find Kolchak rather than Kolchak always chasing the story. What made this series different from TV shows prior to it was that the government was shown to be suppressing attempts by Kolchak to get at the truth in just about every instance. This was a first in TV shows, and is possibly attributable to the fact that this show premiered about a month after Watergate blew wide open and the president was forced to resign. Although there are many  similarities between this show and The X-Files, Carl Kolchak was no Fox Mulder in appearance or style. Like Peter Falk's Columbo, Kolchak wore crumpled attire and had an annoying way about him, but he did get results. Also, each episode of Kolchak was pretty much self-contained. There was no long-running story arc, such as Mulder's search for the truth in what he believed to be the alien abduction of his sister driving him to look for proof of alien existence. If you like shows about the supernatural and you can handle a little 1970's nostalgia and some cheesy special effects, I advise you give this series a try.",1175904000,,1564,4.75
2170767,4,B00066FPCG,"Unless you were one of us who watched ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" during it's original run 30 years ago (and have a nostalgic affection for it), you will probably find this show quaint and tame compared to the horror fare today. The show followed a rigid formula with certain plot elements you could count on every episode: bumbling reporter Carl Kolchak will run afoul of authorities, he will meet a number of eccentrics who help him gather clues, and he will somehow manage to come face-to-face with the terrifying menace at the end. Not every episode was great (The Werewolf, The Spanish Moss Murders, Horror in the Heights, and The Sentry are my favorites), but snappy writing and the great Darren McGavin as Kolchak make these worth checking out. Try to see past the the 70's styles and cheesy production values, and just enjoy it for the fun ""monster of the week"" show it was intended to be.

2170772,5,B00066FPCG,"There is a good reason why ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" is a cult classic.  It has an offbeat character--Kolchak the washed up reporter whose bliss calls him to places where angels fear to tread, and devils often do. Then there is the  offbeat premise--the world is not as it seems, filled with witches, warlocks, and werewolves--and no one seems to care or wants to believe.  Then the offbeat setting--be the INS office or the odd locals where mystery becomes Kolchak.  This is the series strength--the world is almost 1974, with a persistent undercurrent of Macbeth.  Yes, all of the elements are there.

As a character, Kolchak's charm is beyond measure.  Aside from his quirky wardrobe, we first notice that he is a trickster.  That is, he is a fast talking Anasi, Hare, Br'er Rabbit, and Bugs Bunny rolled into one.  Second, unlike Superman, Kolchak is, in G. K Chesterton's words, quite ""eatable"" (Orthodoxy, Ch. 8).  ""In a thrilling novel (that purely Christian product) the hero is not eaten by cannibals; but it is essential to the existence of the thrill that he *might* be eaten by cannibals.""

Lastly, Kolchak is the essential underdog.  He is straightjacketed between editor Vincenzo, and the flux of police detectives, both who never let him win.  In this respect we are all Kolchak, and we follow his example of ""Rage against the machine"" and ""Illegitimi non carborundum.""

However, the technical aspects of the DVD do not live up to the series' standards.  Although the menus are nice, the Universal logo and fanfare keep popping up--OK, we just need to see it once, and we get the idea. On a scale of 5, the transfer is about a 2.  This was a jolt, since the TV movie DVD was a 5+. Lastly, like the TV movie disc, these DVDs are the double-sided ABOMINATION! No!  No!  No!  Since they are so awkward to handle, I would much prefer more discs at a higher price than the accursed double sided discs at a cheaper price.  Kolchak is a series we will watch every October, so the discs must be built to last.

The series does have its has flaws.  It focuses on characterization and setting (Kolchak in a weird world), but not on theme.  There is no cohesion to the episodes, just a steady stream of odd events.  The ""Twilight Zone"" was a consistent exploration of cosmic justice.  In this area, the revival series NuKolchak, was better with the wrist tattoos; we had a sense that the series was going somewhere.  With the original series, we get into a rut of Kolchak's glib Cassandra caterwauling  and random acts of malevolence.  So when the series finally ended, we were a bit relieved.

Favorite episodes:

""The Zombie"" The premise is similar to ""Live and Let Die,"" but the conflict between the pimp, the Mafiosi, and Kolchak, and the dialogue during the phone call leave you laughing.

""The Vampire.""  This episode builds upon the events in the first TV movie, so it is a deeper, and does answer some of the questions we had from the first film.

""The Werewolf."" Placing this episode on a swinging singles cruise was a stroke of genius, the actor who played the werewolf was perfectly cast, and when Kolchak's cabin mate dies, you knew that this episode was serious.  Love the 1970's fashions.

""Horror in the Heights."" Guest starring Phil Silvers.  The mysterious set up--swastikas in a Jewish neighborhood--gets you from the first gammadion.  This episode should be the baptism of fire of Kolchak uninitiates.

""The Trevi Collection.""  Newbies should see this after ""Horror in the Heights.""  If Ghostbusters was darker, I imagine that it would feel like this episode.  It is a nice mixture of everyday 1974 and the undercurrent of Macbeth.  It has nice plot-twists, a well-cast warlock, and the ending cosmic justice are all refreshing.

""Mr. RING"" has the best set-up. The opening narration leaves you wondering, and you see a taproot to the X-files.

""They Have Been, They Are, They Will Be.""  You see an early reference to the MIB in a black limo.

""Legacy of Terror"" is notable for two cameos--Eric Estrada and Boss Hogg.  And watching the dangling recorder in the stairwell is vintage Kolchak.

""The Knightly Murders"".  Being the first episode where Vincenzo questions Kolchak's sanity, this does not jibe with the events in ""The Night Strangler,"" where Kolchak persuades Vincenzo to ""Believe.""

""The Sentry"" The plot is too close to Star Trek's ""Devil in the Dark"" (the Horta) for my taste. But the skeptical female cop grinding against Kolchak changed the dynamics (and chemistry) of the series.  In this sense, this episode is the last of  Kolchak, and the first of X-files.

""The Chopper."" This is generally considered the worst of the series. I see two flaws. Fist, although the funeral scene is vintage Robert Zemeckis, it goes on too long. Second, the special effects leave much to be desired.  Being filmed 3 years before Star Wars, we see why Lucas could not film episodes I-III at that point in time.  Guest stars include Larry Linvel (Frank Burns) who played the surgeon in the first TV Movie, and a comb-over Jim Backus.",1171756800,,5055,4.78150289017341

2170779,5,B00066FPCG,"Thanks to Universal Studios, the complete Kolchak ""The Night Stalker"" television series has finally been released on DVD. The video transfer is really decent and the 2.0 sound is pretty consistent and definitely better than I expected. All 20 episodes of this classic 70's TV series are spread out over 3 double sided discs and that's my only major complaint with this set.

Universal Studios should abandon the double sided discs and go with single sided discs even if it means adding a few more dollars to the price of the set. In a few of the episodes, some of the night scenes are very dark and sometimes it's hard to make out the images. I give this classic show five stars all the way for pure entertainment value. Darren McGavin in my opinion was the perfect choice to play the Kolchak character and he played it to perfection.

This set is well done with nice artwork and individual slim cases for the DVD's, but completely lacking in bonus material. Sadly Mr. McGavin passed away in Feb/2006, so why didn't the studio interview him for the DVD release of this classic show when they had the chance. Any commentary from Darren McGavin or a look back interview from him would have been a welcomed addition to this set. Universal Studios just doesn't get it, including bonus material is another reason to buy these classic shows on DVD.

My only other gripe is that the two Kolchak movies should have been included in the set as well, to complete the entire series. This is the original Night Stalker and it definitely shouldn't be passed up at any price. Rumors about reviving this show have once again emerged, but like all classics they're often imitated and seldom duplicated.

2170787,5,B00066FPCG,"Kolchak--The Night Stalker is one of life's guilty pleasures.  Sure, the series lasted only one season and was high camp at times, but it was Darren McGavin's strong acting who brought the character of fearless and intrepid reporter Karl Kolchak to life. McGavin also co-produced this exciting series.

Although it deals with man-killing monsters and creatures in each episode, the emphasis here is on titillating the audience--not to terrify them. ""Kolchak"" works because the writers (ex-Twilight Zone alumnus Richard Matheson)and directors like David Chase who chose to keep the monsters in the shadows, and preferred suggestive horror to the explicit stuff we have grown accustomed to with today's typical slice-and-dice horror films.

Added to this was McGavin as a completely credible, eccentric, and  down-at-the-heels newshawk with his tape recorder and Kodak Instamatic at the ready, narrating events as they occur while lending a feel of authenticity as his story unfolds.

Light humor also took some of the edge off the scarier bits in this highly entertaining series. Supporting roles featured veteran actor, Simon Oakland, as Kolchak's annoying and demanding boss in a role well-suited to his character.

The pilot for the series, ""The Night Stalker"" is a tour de force about a vampire running loose in Las Vegas--a most appropriate setting for a vampire film when you think about it--a city that lives by night.  The episodes that would follow featured Jack the Ripper, zombies, werewolves, rampaging robots, and a headless ""horseman"" who rides a motorcycle rather than a horse! This DVD set is nicely packaged and the transfers are adequate; despite these being Universal double sided discs, I experienced no skipping or freezing with my purchase.

Sadly, the series went unnoticed without a review in TV Guide, and once ABC's new programming boss, Fred Silverman (who disliked sci-fi and fantasy shows) took over the reins of the network, Kolchak was pulled from his beat permanently.",1152921600,14,1999,5.30379746835443

With Darren McGavin starring as Carl Kolchak and such guest stars as Jim Backus, Dick Van Patten, Erik Estrada, Cathy Lee Crosby and Tom Skerritt how can you lose?

OK, there are no extras and the episode ""Chopper"" about a headless biker was badly done.  But the rest of the series was magic - great plots, great humor and lots of action.  A zombie, a werewolf, ghosts, Greek Gods, aliens and even an episode about a robot!  And Carl was always there with a tape recorder, a flash camera and an open mind.  Pity the poor police officer who gets in his way.",1150675200,4,919,4.3023255813953485
2170793,5,B00066FPCG,"Does anyone remember a ""Mystery episode"" of Night Stalker.
I saw it on either CBS late Night, WOR in Secsucus NJ or possibly SciFi Channel in the early nineties. It was a (very heavily) edited version of
""The Night Strangler"".  It was cut down to air in the usual hour time slot.
It had the usual Kolchak opening credits sequence. The ending was altered so that you never learned the identity of the killer or what kind of monster he was. Richard Anderson wasn't in it at all.
None of the Night Stalker sites or episode guides mention it and several fans of the show have told me I am out of my mind. However, I have met
other fans who say they saw the same thing.  I know I am not crazy because I didn't even see the movie Night Strangler until it was released on DVD, and was surprised to see it was the same as the episode I had seen many years ago. One of my buddies says he had the same surprise when viewing the DVD.  I expected that episode to be on this DVD collection. Can anyone help?",1149811200,,994,4.139896373056994

They did not work on them; no cleaning up.  They crammed 20 episodes on 3 discs.  What you get is what you would see if you took the film and viewed it in your projector at home.

They are uncut,--a definite plus.  They are clear and in some spots not so clear.  But the better the television, the better the eps play.  So you take the good with the bad.  And hopefully, Universal, will produce a truly first class rendition of the series sometime in the future.  Extras and all; revamped and lit with the lamp of true digital technology.

I hope; but I purchased two sets of this edition just in case.

Enjoy the original television movies on their own dual-sided disc (much nicer job on these); and enjoy these while they are around.  In a word: Enjoy!

This is for those folks who are getting frustrated by what they believe to be ""faulty"" DVD copies of this series. Universal has been getting hammered for many of the their classic television DVD releases. You'll find the same complaints about defective DVDs from those purchasing ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" and ""Columbo.""

I don't like double-sided discs either, but I got to tell you, my Kolchak DVD collection plays fine. So do my collections of Alfred Hitchcock and Columbo. DVD players are a dime a dozen these days. You could buy one for $20. But those cheap models just don't work that well. I know. I used to own one. When I first purchased the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD a few years back, I ended up taking it back to the store three times because I couldn't get it to play. I thought the discs were defective. What I later learned was that the cheap Apex DVD player I owned can't play all DVDs properly. After purchasing a new HD television last year, I also bought a higher-end Sony DVD player for about $80. The new DVD player has had no trouble playing Kolchak, Alfred Hitchcock, Columbo and Star Wars.

I am 100 percent certain that at least 95 percent of those who have claimed foul on the Kolchak collection, as well as other DVD collections, are pointing their fingers at the wrong culprit. If you like watching DVDs, go get yourself a decent DVD player.",1146441600,12,1499,4.548148148148148

2170800,2,B00066FPCG,"KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER, airing 1974-75, followed up on the success of two previously aired made for TV movies: ""The Night Stalker"" (1971) and ""The Night Strangler"" (1973). While this reviewer has seen neither movie (and therefore has to suspend judgment as to their quality), quite a few others have extended praise on their behalf. Be that as it may, as far as *this* complete DVD set is concerned, one really should make the attempt to critique through lenses free of nostalgic fog.

Without question, the main virtue of this series ( now an ""oldie"" ) is located in the late Darren McGavin's dynamic portrayal of quirky Chicago reporter, Carl Kolchak and his encounters with various instances of strange ( and largely malevolent ) phenomenon. His humorous interplay with the cast regulars, especially Simon Oakland (Kolchak's grizzled boss, Tony Vincenzo ), redeemed a good deal of the outright silliness that passed for scary in 1975 ( I do, however, freely admit to being frightened as a 10 year old! ). Truly, McGavin's talent was well above the material provided through largely paltry scripts. Out of the 20 episodes featured, only four or five displayed any kind of consistent quality: ""The Vampire"", ""The Spanish Moss Murders"", ""Demon in Lace"", ""The Sentry"" and ( above all ) ""Horror in the Heights"". The rest run the gamut from fair to awful, enjoyable only if one is an inveterate collector of all things 70's, or perhaps taking a stroll down memory lane. If, however, one is looking for genuine thrills, it would undoubtedly pay to find the few worthy episodes in the local video shop.

Final note: aside from Darren McGavin's acting, the only other substantial attribute KOLCHAK possesses is the interest of one of its fans, a fellow named Chris Carter. Apparently, Carter drew upon aspects of the Kolchak character while fashioning his landmark creation THE X FILES and its main protagonist, Fox Mulder. For this reason alone, KOLCHAK deserves a measure of respect.",1142985600,6,1983,4.9879154078549846

  i remember watching this show every friday night when it first aired and i loved it. every time i found some channel running it i would watch. now after years and a failed try at redoing the show the darren mcgavin show is finaly on dvd. some other worldly fiend has cut any extras out of the mix but thats  ok because we have all 20 shows that were shot in there running order and we can marvel at the talented darren mcgavin having a ball playing kolchak and making the outlandash stories believeable. mr mcgavin is a truely great actor and should be given some respect brfore he leaves us for good.

  all the monsters are here and even though some of the shows are very scary you can watch them with your older kids and enjoy how much they like the night stalker.""just get the story kolchak,and don't go bannanas."" well in the scary world of kolchak the stories are hard to believe, ""but we know the truth"" because to quote the show most helped by the night stalker ""the truth is out there""",1142380800,,1687,4.260188087774295

Remember, this show was filmed in the seventies, and some of the action scenes are hasty, some of the adversaries (notably the werewolf and the chopper ghoul) are just plain badly done, and some of the periperal characters are quite contrived. Setting these items aside, we have an outstanding lead in Kolchak, and his interaction with the staff of INS, his newspaper, and especially with his editor, Vincenzo, are priceless. Follow this inept, yet determined reporter as he gets bullied around by the authorities, gets doors slammed in his face by witnesses, and always manages to get in the direct path of whatever nightmarish creature is out  wreaking havoc on the city of Chicago.

2170804,5,B00066FPCG,"FIRST A SAD NOTE: Darren McGavin passed away on ""Feb. 26th in L.A. due to natural causes""

BRIEFLY: I waited 30 years for Kolchak-The Night Stalker to come to DVD and, surprisingly, it was worth the wait. I saw all twenty episodes consecutively within a couple of days.

Kolchak The Night Stalker, is a really crazy, 70s style, hour long TV program starring Darren McGavin, as Kolchak. Kolchak appears to be a total crack-pot, sensationalizing yellow journalist. But -- looks can be disceiving. He's not a crack-pot, he's not making this stuff up, and he's not a yellow journalist.

NEVERTHELESS -- nobody believes him. Every week he single handedly dispenses with the ""monster-of-the-week"", and still nobody seems to believe him. Armed only with a camera, Kolchak bumbles into the occult, the unbeleivable and the unseen, all of which are very deadly, and without thanks, he saves us all --- every week -- twenty times in all. There are no tricks, no CGI, no gadgets or weapons in any conventional sense. Sometimes, in the course of his investigation, he stumbles onto secret weapons: like arrows blessed by the divine Brahma, wooden stakes or even words used to denounce the evil!

THE DVD BOXED SET: There are NO extras or frills on the 3 double-sided disks, but for me, they played very well, and appear to have a clean, excellent transfer onto DVD. I have read here that some people had problems with the set not playing well. Mine did, but this type of double-sided DVD is prone to problems, and I have had them on other sets of this kind, and it can be very frustrating.

--- SEEING THE GLASS [DVD SET] AS HALF-FULL RATHER THAN HALF-EMPTY --

Nevertheless, though I would have loved extras; commentary, interviews, and maybe some relevant featurettes, it is really the quality of the transfer, and the restoration to full-length that makes this a must-have DVD set. Furthermore, there are virtually NO missing scenes. In recent years I have not dared to watch Kolchak for fear of realizing, ruefully, how many scenes were literally hacked-out so that the running time could be reduced by 6-9 minutes for commercials. I found myself trying to recall the missing scenes to the point of utter stress, and complete distraction. Now all that has changed for the better. Being able to see Kholchak, the way it was originally intended, fullfills most of what is expected from any DVD set by any fan, including me. Because this DVD set does accomplish those objectives, and it the cost is quite reasonable, I think of this set as a glass that is half-full rather than half-empty.

I can't stress enough the value, that this DVD set has within it, despite its intrinsic shortcomings. Everything you need to enjoy the series, an excellent transfer, and each of the 20 episodes in their entirety [51 minutes + or -] is present.

Naturally, if you have glitches on your set, which seems more likely when it is double-sided, you have every reason to be dismayed. Fortunately, Amazon itself, has a pretty liberal return policy in the event of such mishaps, and that, to some extent does mitigate the concern for us. In the meantime, I am really enjoying the series, and the knowledge that it is within easy reach whenever I wish to enjoy it.

MY FAVORITE EPISODES: ""THE SPANISH MOSS MONSTER"", which is vintage semi-scary Kholchak at its best. ""HORROR IN THE HEIGHTS!"" with ""The Rakshasa"" as the classic supernatural, and unbelievable monster. In all episodes, the supporting cast is excellent, but in these two the combination of Kholchak ambience, and scary bedtime story texture, makes them the standouts for me.",1141776000,3,3607,4.842532467532467
2170805,5,B00066FPCG,"To anyone who grew up in the 70's as I did, this show will probably stick out in your mind as one of the most original horror flicks of it's time due to it's original themes and the charismatic Darren McGavin, who played Carl Kolchak to clumsy and rumpled perfection. One of the long-standing ironies of the show was that no matter how many monsters he fought or how much evidence gathered, no one believed him, so the poor guy trudged on alone each week.

As a kid of 15, Night Stalker was the 70's version of X-Files and Buffy, only IMO it was MORE suspenseful than those two shows in this regards: Kolchak never carried a gun (like Mulder or Scully) nor did he have super powers (like Buffy), the dude was also middle-aged, in questionable shape, and was clumsy as hell. When he took on a monster all he had was his wits, maybe some homemade weapon, and his bungling courage. It's a miracle this guy wasn't turned into monster food in the first few episodes.

This show may seem cheesy by today's standards but what it lacks in special effects it more than makes up for with terrific acting, not only by the inimitable McGavin himself, but by a great ensemble cast, and this to me was the main appeal of the show. You could almost feel the camaraderie of the cast.

I'll admit that not all the episodes were great (some were even lame), but overall it was one of the most suspenseful shows of it's time, and IMO is STILL a great show.

2170806,4,B00066FPCG,"I have to agree with several other reviewers--this DVD set of an otherwise great show has problems that make it difficult to recommend. I've had several episodes pixelate, hang and skip. By the way, you can work around this, after it skips, by backing up to a few seconds after the skip, but you might have to try several times to get it right. This appears to be a problem only with double-sided disks. It's false economy--I would gladly pay a few more dollars for single-sided DVDs, and I'm sure most other buyers would also. We need to stop buying double-sided releases until the studios get it right.

P.S. For all of those later reviewers who blame cheap DVD players for the freezing and skipping problems that these disks have--that's NOT the case.

2170813,4,B00066FPCG,"KOLCHAK - THE NIGHT STALKER was the 1974 - 1975 X-Files of its day.  In many ways, the basic plot formula has been around for decades.  A guy discovers an inexplicable threat to mankind.  Traditional law enforcement does not believe the guy.  Guy takes on the threat and defeats it.  Guy arrested or threatened with trumped up criminal charges if he ever speaks of word of what happened. Much like many of Stephen King's characters or Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Kolchak is a person who unwittingly seems to attract evil forces.

The element of this series that made the show so special was Darren (A Christmas Story) McGavin.  McGavin's portrayal of Kolchak, attired in beat up suit more appropriate for the tropics, was so unbelievable that it was perfect.  It is difficult to imagine anyone else playing the part.  McGavin is Kolchak.

Carl Kolchak is a reporter who has seen more successful days as a crime reporter.  Despite career setbacks, he ignores traditional reporting, income, and a normal life to pursue bizarre stories.  Kolchak works for Independent News Service, INS, in Chicago.  If Kolchak's attire is out of place, so is the antiquated newsroom of INS.  It looks more like something out of the 1940s where Edward G. Robinson would be very much at home. Even Lou Grant faired better when he returned to the newspaper business.

KOLCHAK - THE NIGHT STALKER television series followed two very successfull television movies.  The first, THE NIGHT STALKER, aired in 1972 and enjoyed a record breaking viewing audience.  The sequel, THE NIGHT STRANGLER, followed a year later.  A third installment, THE NIGHT KILLERS, was scrapped in favor of the television series.

Unfortunately the weekly series failed to sustain a following on network television.  As a yearly television installment, Kolchak was a much anticipated movie of the week.  As a regular series the novelty wore out too quickly for all but die-hard NIGHT STALKER fans.  It was also said that Darren McGavin tired of character and opted out of the series.  The show disappeared.

Since that time the television movies resurfaced on VHS.  Some time later a couple episodes were paired for video release.  It is about time that all 20 episodes have finally become available on DVD.

There are areas of opportunity for this DVD release.  The DVD transfer unfortunately leaves many of the scenes too dark.  Granted, much of Night Stalker takes place at night, but it would be nice to see what is going on.  Next is that I miss couple seconds of old-fashioned Universal logo and music at the conclusion of each episode.  Finally, this release begs for special features.  Simply put: There are none.

After reading all the negative reviews about the transfer quality, I, too, was very apprehensive about buying this. I'm glad I chose to ignore the warnings. Other than the show's opening segment and ""The Ripper"" episode, (which does display specks, debris, and a somewhat dark image), I see nothing, repeat, NOTHING wrong with the transfer quality on any other episode.

Low light conditions = graininess, especially if shot with a high shutter speed and especially for something shot over 30 years ago. That's a fact. Images are sharp, crisp, fleshtones are accurate, and sound quality is good. It's the best I've seen these episodes look, even after comparing to what I've seen air on Sci Fi. Yes, there should have been more extras, and I'm deducting a star for that, but do not be scared off by the idiots on Amazon who complain about poor image quality because they don't know how to calibrate their equipment or they can't understand why their DVDs skip on their priceless $25 Coby DVD players.",1137456000,20,1313,4.887892376681615

""Kolchak"" picks up where the ""Night Strangler"" movie left off, with intrepid investigative reporter (and forerunner of everyone from John McClane to Clarice Starling and Fox Mulder) Carl Kolchak battling demons, witches covens, Aztec cults, vampires, rippers, werewolves and headless bikers in the Windy City.

Low production values inspire a few unexpected giggles; the amazingly bad makeup jobs in ""The Werewolf"" and ""Chopper"" are examples of talented filmmakers making the most of zero-dollar budgets. Still, I gotta admire the show's attempts to give Kolchak some imaginative monsters to defeat.

Darren McGavin was (and still is) the reason to watch the show. He believes in these ghosts and goblins so passionately that we believe in them, too, no matter how shoddy the effects. This is one of the classic television performances, and Kolchak is truly an unforgettable character, right up there with Archie Bunker and George Costanza.

The quality of these episodes ranges from poor to very good; my favorites are ""The Devil's Platform"" and ""The Vampire,"" which get high marks thanks to their writing. (""What is it that you hate about my hat?"" ""What's under it!""). And ""Chopper"" has a great supporting performance from Larry Linville of ""MASH."" (The episode itself is almost ruined by its rather comic headless head-chopper.)

In the end, you either love ""Kolchak"" in spite of its cheap production values, or you don't. I do love ""Kolchak,"" and count this DVD set as a treasure in my collection. No, the episodes didn't cost a million dollars to produce, but there's no doubt that the charm, heart and humanity of the series survived the 1970s ... and the crypt of TV oblivion.",1136246400,10,1940,5.012422360248447

As for the video quality, it doesn't seem to me to be any worse than watching it on TV, so no compliants there. The audio is also fine.

Overall, the shows themselves are fine, but it would have been great if they included some interviews or trivia. Maybe they didn't realize the extent of the following this show had, where we only had 20 episodes to feast on.  This was by far Darren Mcgavin's finest hour.",1135641600,5,578,4.236363636363636
2170819,5,B00066FPCG,"This reviewer will not waste your time rehashing the Kolchak series.  Instead, this review is intended for fans of the series who already know what the whole ""Kolchak thing"" is about and don't need an episode by episode breakdown.  If you want that type of review, please check out one of the Spotlight Reviews found at the top of this page.  Before I bought the DVD, I was concerned because in doing my research by reading Amazon reviews of the series, there was two major criticisms that were established.  One, the quality of the transfer from film/video to DVD was poor and two, there was a lack of ""extras"" with the DVD.  I'm glad I didn't get scared off by some of the naysayers that reviewed the DVD.

True Kolchak fans will NOT be bothered by these criticisms.  The film quality of the series is not unlike what I remember when I watched the show 30 years ago.  It's supposed to be dark and dreary!!  It's not much different than the lighting and scenery found in The X Files or CSI.  What ever shortcomings in ""extras"" is worth the tradeoff in finally having the whole series available to Kolchak fans!

My advice to fans of the series is get a copy while you can.  Waiting for a new higher-priced ""collector's edition"" won't be worth the time or the extra cash.  If you liked the series, then you will be pleased with this DVD!",1135641600,5,1337,4.4526748971193415
2170820,4,B00066FPCG,"If you're reading this review you probably already know you enjoy ""Kolchak: the night stalker."" There are fifty reviews as of this writing and it appears everyone writing seems to enjoy the series though not the quality of the viewing.

I have great fondness for the series because as others have written, I too, waited each week for the next installment of evil forces to be banished by Carl Kolchak. I caught the reruns on CBS on Friday nights.

Granted they were low budget and while you have stock footage of Chicago, most scenes are filmed in the San Fernando Valley, CA area. The ""Energy Eaters"" hospital is Kaiser Permanente in Panorama City (my birth hospital) and on a good version of ""The Zombie"" you can see four emissions stacks from an LA County works plant in Sun Valley, CA while Kolchak roams through the junk yard.

If you have read the other reviews you'll know the set includes all 20 episodes. You'll also know that the transference quality is poor. I will reiterate the comments of other reviewers and say shame on Universal. The quality seems especially poor on side A of disc one. The ""Ripper"" is by and large a lost cause since so much of it takes place at night and you will miss out on some of the action, the screen at times is simply black. The quality appears to improve as the episodes progress.

Having read the previous reviews I hesitated in my purchase of the set. I was warned repeatedly about the quality and now you are warned again. Universal could have done a better job.

But the appeal of the Night Stalker with its mystery, campy style and banter is too much for a Night Stalker fan.

* Would I recommend you purchase the set? ""Yes""
* Are the episodes as you might recall staying up late on a Friday night in the `70's? ""Yes, though a few are of poorer quality showing then even my old TV from the `70's put out""
* Would extras such as commentaries, behind the scenes views, interviews, etc., be a nice touch? ""You bet they would have been""
* Are you paying for those extras at $29.99 (about $1.50 an episode)? ""Nope""
* Boy I sure did enjoy the series and have waited years for the collection to come out, but I'm not sure if I should wait a little longer for a better quality edition? ""If you think Universal will `get right on it' then you may be prime fodder for the next episode""

If you have waited for the opportunity to enjoy and re-live the experiences of Kolchak: the Night Stalker, wait no longer.

Update since original posting ***

Dateline February 26, 2006
With the passing of Darren McGavin yesterday the likelihood that Universal will come out with another improved set with extra features has diminished.
FACT - Mr. McGavin was critical of many roles he played on TV so it's not surprising that he may have been glad to remove himself from the role as Carl Kolchak.
ITEM - viewers with no imagination, understanding of 1970's special effects or TV shows on minimal budgets may be dissatisfied with the special effects of rubberized lizards, UFO's and creature costumes. They need not waste their time watching this show.",1135468800,8,3079,4.543321299638989
2170821,5,B00066FPCG,"growing up i can remeber watching this show on friday nights and loving it.now at last it comes to dvd, and it looks great, but they didn't include any extras and that is a little upseting. but they have got all the shows in order and maybe kolchak can track the demon who left the extras out. turn down the lights unplug the phone pop some popcorn get a soda and set back and watch kolchak save us from the forces of evil.",1135036800,4,423,4.108433734939759
2170822,5,B00066FPCG,"In many ways ""FIRE FALL"" and ""LEGACY OF TERROR"" are two of the finest KOLCHAK episodes. Not only are the scares all there, but the writing in both episodes raises some interesting questions about sex, fame, and money in America.

""FIRE FALL"" is a study in envy and frustrated desires worthy of Russell Banks at his best. A small time hood who once dreamed of success as a classical musician is gunned own in a penny arcade. But he comes back as an angry ghost with the power to incinerate anyone he hates in a freak fire! Still more chilling, Frankie Markov's real desire is to ""take over"" the life of golden boy society composer Ryder Bond.

What makes this episode really work is the smoldering anger of the murdered hood. The more Kolchak digs into the story, the more of a picture we get of class in America. Frankie never got a break. His wife is a cheap tramp, his bosses betrayed him, and his dreams were all betrayed through no fault of his own.

On the other hand, Ryder Bond has a life of unlimited possibilities. Success in his art, rewarding career, glamorous lifestyle, flattering public attention, and in private the attentions of a lovely and adoring French girlfriend. Even while you hate to see how the angry working class ""ghost"" torments this poor man, you can see why Frankie hates Ryder so much. He wants to be Ryder too!

Kolchak, very interestingly, does not seem to empathize with the ghost of Frankie, even though they are both working class guys. But he does everything he can to help Ryder retain his sanity and defeat the tormenting ghost that has torched his friends. In the end you're left wondering whether there wasn't some way Ryder Bond could have done more for the Frankies of this world.

""LEGACY OF TERROR"" gives you the same kind of story, but with an even more provocative twist. When Aztec priests look to bring their warrior mummy back to life, they need a willing sacrifice. Who better than a spoiled, resentful Chicano punk, briliantly played by a young (and gorgeous) Erik Estrada? It's worth noting that Estrada is fearless as an actor here. Instead of making Pepe an innocent, deluded fool, he boldly plays him as a spoiled, self-pitying punk -- getting laughs and hitting uncomfortably close to home. ""Friend, you're bending my mind off my music!""

Pepe is holed up in a luxury hotel, helping the priests choose ""perfect"" sacrifices for the mummy waiting to be reborn. A football star, a Green Beret . . . and a very demure and ladylike Air Force officer. (And some interesting feminist back and forth between the officer and the hotel's PR lady.)

Kolchak really outdoes himself in this one, digging out secrets in the hotel basement and consulting a very touchy taxidermist (a hilarious cameo by theater great Sorrell Booke.) But the Kolchak and Vincenzo repartee really makes this one soar.

""First this mummy is cluttering up someone's basement and now he's marching in Macy's easter parade? Look Carl. You  yourself said that the mummy disappeared. You got a terrible hit in the head and you saw things. And as for having a dummy in a key staff position . . . I'm as guilty as the next.""

MY PICK: Both these episodes are in the Kolchak top ten!!!",1134777600,4,3199,4.646017699115045
2170823,4,B00066FPCG,"You know what you are getting.  These are DVD's of a television show from the 1970's provided to us by Universal Studios. Universal's an outfit whose total disregard for anything approching meaningful customer product quality is legendary.  Universal could have done better providing extras or at very least cleaning up the video and audio quality which is why I subtracted a star.

That said You have gotta love Kolchak - The Night Stalker staring Darren McGavin as the quirky off beat news man's, newsman who single handedly defines the series.  While I will be the first to agree that yes the pilot episodes were head and shoulders above the series in quality of writing and quality of sets or special effects.  I stronly feel Kolchak - The Night Stalker the series took on an odd ball mix of both charm and humor along with its horror that made the overall viewing experience a unique pleasure nonetheless.  Yes by today's standards Kolchak - The Night Stalker fairs no better than Star Trek The Original Series does when compared to its brighter techno glitzy 90's spawn Star Trek the Next Generation that is a given.  But the old series had its own artistic merit.

Kolchak - The Night Stalker was not all about horror it was a unique mix of horror and fun.  Unike the X files whose mission was to make you think Kolchak - The Night Stalker did not ask you to think.  Kolchak - The Night Stalker was like really wack wild strange friend who visited once a week suggesting LIKE DUDES AND SISTA'S HEY WHAT IF? as it began spinning its WAY Campy over the top tongue in cheek yarn begging you to just settle back and have a shock and giggle mixer with a bit of 70's disco era flava thrown in.

Kolchak - The Night Stalker was the X Files for a more calm gentle age.  Kolchak - The Night Stalker shared the same unsophisticated now quaint one demensional charm as 70's era video games like pong, space invaders, break out and asteroids among others.  For some 70's video games retain playability laughs and beauty likewise for we who truly enjoyed the quirky Charm of Darren McGavin's Kolchak, The Night Stalker's fun is on these DVD's just waiting to be rekindled.

I own the VHS version's of Kolchak, The Night Stalker the series but for such a totally reasonable complete series price I am gladly upgrading my meidia to the DVD versions.  Besides this DVD set of Kolchak - The Night Stalker beat's enduring the hacked up butchered SCI FI channel offerings cold so buy em folks you can't go wrong at the Low AMAZON.com price.",1134172800,4,2528,4.586666666666667
2170824,1,B00066FPCG,"I hate to write this review.  I discovered Kolchak in syndication and eventually fell in love with it.  When I heard about this DVD release of the entire series, I was ecstatic and instantly purchased it.

What I found, however, was pitiful.

NOT the series.  No, no, this is one of the lost greats of TV Land.  No, what is pitiful is the quality of the DVD.  It would seem (in my case anyway) that in their haste to cash in on the crappy redux of the show, Universal has supplied us (or maybe just me) with very low quality discs.  My episodes REPEATEDLY skip, pixelate, and some eps won't even start up at all.  I was appalled and took my copy back to get another one.  I sit down tonight to watch another episode.

Nope.  Can't happen.  My copy freezes, then jumps fifteen minutes later.  Pitiful.  I want to take my second copy back for a third, but fear the same thing will happen.  I am continually met with disappointment as I try to enjoy a series that, apparently, I never will on DVD.

For the sake of the late, great original, I urge you to buy Kolchak on DVD...but buy it at your own risk.",1133913600,45,1101,4.241545893719807
2170825,5,B00066FPCG,"I remember watching this show when I was little and getting scared out of my wits.  Now 30 years later, to watch them on DVD (and let's face it, like the 80's Twilight Zone DVD's, they were shot on film and the original masters were probably lost...be glad they're all available along with the original 2 TV-movies that introduced Carl Kolchak).  I now watch with amazement just how much Chris Carter copped this show for the X-files.  Many a time I wanted to throw something at the screen when Kolchak gets denied access or has a ham-handed response given by an authority figure (one of the drawbacks of watching the show all at once instead of a weekly installment); but even the whistling theme song during the opening credits got me thinking: Here we've been idolizing the X-files on its originality and cleverness when this show was doing the same thing 2 decades before.  Granted, a lot of the show's themes and looks are terribly dated in the 70's.  And the murders are usually done off-screen (or as a freeze-frame when the monster jumps out at its next victim).  ""Chopper"" is still one of the most tasteless episodes with the headless biker, but if you peel away the obvious fake ""headless"" mockup, you will find an update of ""Sleepy Hollow."" Thanks to Universal for putting this series out on DVD.

And I didn't have a single problem with the double-sided DVD's playing in my machine.  What I don't like about double-sided DVD's is getting fingerprints, dirt and scratches on the surface.  I can't imagine it is more cost effective to press two-sides.  Since you can DVD author at home, it's more a case of packaging.  I would rather have seen 5 discs in the slim-line cases, but then you would have paid for the cases more than the DVD's, and that would probably be a waste of plastic.  And let's not forget, you're actually paying more for the content and not the manufacturing costs for DVD's to begin with.",1133913600,4,1920,4.631268436578171
2170826,3,B00066FPCG,"Midway through the legendary horror series, we have two better than average episodes.

""DEVIL'S PLATFORM"" should really be called ""DEVIL DOG."" A tough, sexy young politician sells his soul to the devil to gain super powers. The main power he gets is to turn himself into a fierce demonic attack dog at will, tearing the throats of his enemies!

This episode works on a number of levels. The sardonic portrait of politics is good and funny. ""A political expose is fine, Carl,"" says editor Tony Vincenzo. ""But why does ours have to have a dog in it?""

The Satanic stuff is handled well, scary and exciting. Watch for the ""temptation of Kolchack"" scene where the devil's man tempts Kolchak with a suede-backed chair. When offering his soul to Satan at the altar, the politician recites a hilarious ""rhyme"" that goes something like, ""The weed of crime bears bitter fruit/Let Satan take my horn and toot/My soul is his and it's a beaut/I've got a gun don't make me shoot.""

Last but not least, Senator Palmer's wife is really sympathetic, angry and disillusioned with her husband, but poised and lovely at the same time. As Kolchak says, hopefully she finds a nice dog (read bed partner) to take care of after her ""devil dog"" vanishes into the netherworld.

""HORROR IN THE HEIGHTS"" gets a lot more respect than it deserves, principally due to the supporting cast. Phil Silvers leads an elite team of aging Borscht Belt Jews doing shtick -- and doing it, and doing it. Fortunately the kvetching and schmoozing comes to an abrupt end when a flesh-eating demon from India makes the scene. The Rakshasa is made a bit ludicrous by the fact that the man hunting him is ninety years old and wielding a crossbow! Kolchak has to pinch hit for the old timer, and a surprise ending involving Miss Emily generates a moderate amount of tension. But all things considered, ""Rakshasa"" is a vastly over-rated episode.

My vote: Go with DEVIL DOGS as your top choice!",1133395200,2,1945,4.722713864306785
2170827,1,B00066FPCG,"You wouldn't be looking if you didn't already love the series.  Thirty years later it still retains its campy charm.  Kolchak as played by Darren McGavin is without a doubt one of the great television characters---a Watergate-era hero with a commitment to the truth, no matter how crazy it might be.  If only there were a few like him on the job now...

The series itself I give five stars, if only because I have loved it ever since my mother allowed me to watch it (unbelievably) at the age of 4.  I was particularly traumatized by The Trevi Collection and had a phobia about store mannequins for years afterwards.  Despite its brief span of 20 episodes, The Night Stalker was an inventive show that was way ahead of its time and for my money far superior to the rather dour and dead-pan X-Files.  This was a show that not only scared you but made you laugh.

In regards to the Universal DVD release---well, it's pretty standard Universal fare, which means 1 star.  The usual dual-sided DVDs with no extras and no-frills packaging.  At least this set features mini-cases as well as the uncut episodes (as opposed to the Sci Fi channel's hatchet jobs).  The transfer is pretty crummy but then again I get a certain nostalgia watching it that way---I mean, that was the way reruns on TV used to look---washed out, high contrast.  Naturally Universal wouldn't spend a dime on cleaning it up.  Why should they when they know we'll buy it anyway?  That's the power of corporate control over nostalgia.

Of course this doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it.  By all means, do so.  Forget about Universal and just settle back, whistle those first few bars with Carl and enjoy the show and the memories.",1132963200,19,1693,4.62751677852349

Today what stands out is the show never took itself to seriously,
there is always well timed comic relief. Something missing from the ""NEW KOLCHAK"". The show is still a lot of fun! While the acting is often over the top and writing is sometimes predictable that's  much of it's charm. In terms of Special Effects well its up there with ""Robot Monster""! The better shows you never see the ""Man in the Monster Suit"". Love the cast and the 70's guest stars!

Really, the new show isn't a Night Stalker remake, it's a Millennium remake (Frank Spotnitz is remaking his less than successful and a lot less than good X-Files followup, Millennium, using the character names from the old Night Stalker show, I suspect in a blatant attempt to confuse/override the crapyness of Millennium with the good show that the original Night Stalker was. Consider, the original Night Stalker has had a following for 30+ years, ""inspired"" several X-Files episodes (""inspired"" very, very closely, ""homage"" is another euphemism used to describe the remarkable likeness between the two shows) and now, a major network ""remake"", which is a testament to how highly regarded the original was.

Whilst the first episode THE VAMPIRE is very dark and grainy, there are other episodes that are much less so. The show was originally very dark as I remember, keeping it in tune with the mood and tone, but the daylight scenes seem fine to me. It's the type of show you watch with the lights out anyhow, like any spookfest. You need a good quality player with a dual laser to view this set without any problems however, given the amount of information encoded and crammed on each disc. My previous player exhibited the kind of problems others have mentioned here, especially when I played discs that had lots of info encoded.

2170831,4,B00066FPCG,"I have read most of the reviews regarding this complete box set of the 1974-75 ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" television series, and will have to hold my vote until I've had the opportunity to see all the episodes. I have seen the first show, ""The Ripper"", and agree that the picture is very, very dark and hard to make out in many scenes. That does bother me a bit, but what bothers me even more are the many reviews below indicating that the double-sided DVDs are quite prone to freezing, skipping or even (in one case) locking up one poster's DVD player! It is almost with dread that I begin viewing the remaining 19 episodes! I just know I will be EXPECTING some sort of malfunction which will take away from the pleasure and fun of enjoying these priceless shows again! It seems that any TV show which was (or is) remotely popular is now, or soon will be, featured as a boxed DVD set. While this is a good thing on the face of it, the fact that these studios keep cranking them out at a record pace can only mean cutting corners and cutting costs in order to get them into circulation as fast as possible. As a result, we get certain studios (read: UNIVERSAL) who can't see beyond a buck, and take an assembly line approach to spewing out their boxed TV sets, instead of taking the time to show consumers they care about quality over quantity. I have also purchased Universal's first season boxed set of Alfred Hitchcock Presents and, while there are also quality issues with that set as well (it doesn't appear as though this set was restored or cleaned up, either), so far I haven't had any real problems with it, although I have only viewed around half of the AHP shows to date.) If you read the reviews of the AHP series on this Amazon website, you will also find several people have had malfunction issues with it. That set is also featured on 'flipper discs'. So, here I go..... about to watch the second episode of Kolchak as, all the while, in the back of my mind, I am just WAITING for the other shoe to drop, and one of the epsiodes to freeze up on me! This will surely detract from my viewing enjoyment. The 4-star rating I have given is for the excellence of the series itself, which most certainly qualifies for 5 stars in my book.

Most regrettably there have been mention of defects in the discs, not just shoddy packing. Actually I could live with the packaging--simple as it is, bare bones. But I do not abide by nor could ever feel confident in the double-sided DVD. I feel it is an ill-conceived idea with obvious potential problems. I am needing to return mine as it is freezing up and the image would go haywire in a number of the episodes,and will try another set. I am at pains to give Universal the benefit of the doubt, but really it must be said that the extra cost in producing more stable packaging would have been gladly acceptable to those who treasure this show. Even those Digiview dollar discs have shown better and more sensible production quality. And as others have mentioned, the scenes that are limited in lighting show up nearly dark!

I may need to just wait patiently for the suits of Universal to be more considerate or perhaps another company (Anchor Bay perhaps?) to present it decently. The contents of these three double-sided discs can obviously fit satisfactory on five single-sided discs.",1131148800,4,1308,4.682608695652174

KOLCHAK:THE NIGHT STALKER hails from a time when TV shows could still be fun, and it was made by people who understand the real appeal of ""horror"" (i.e., how it can scare and entertain at the same time).

Most of today's programs are bogged-down in their own pretensions and desire to be ""adult"" or ""gritty"". The people behind them forget that television is not reality. It's not supposed to be! Bizarre and amazing things can happen in a world created for television.

KOLCHAK offered great stories, generous doses of humor, some genuine chills and absoutely unforgettable characters. Kolchak himself is worth the price of admission. You can sense the terror that flows over him as he undertakes some foolishly dangerous action, but you know that the guy is driven by his principles.

Rubber-suited monsters? There's nothing wrong with that. KOLCHAK  has HEART, and a real sense of fun ..... moreso than 99% of the current crop of CGI-saturated ""blockbusters."" In fact, the show allows you to dig back and remember what scared you when you were a kid. That's another thing in its favor.

2170835,4,B00066FPCG,"Chris Carter, creator of the X-Files, admitted his inspiration for the series to be the 70's network series Kolchak: The Night Stalker.  The series a  spin-off of two successful made-for-tv-movies about a newspaper reporter learning the hard way that the truth ""is"" out there, a truth invariably dismissed week after week by his short-fused editor.  Carl Kolchak, played by Darren McGavin, now best known for ""the Christmas Story"" dad, gruffly pursues his stories no matter what supernatural path they might lead him down. Whether it be Aztec cults, Moss-monsters, Witches, Demons, headless motorcyclists, or the series' staples: Vampires. Kolchak fights them all. Sometimes Kolchak seems a far cry from heroic, at times almost cowardly, but we always admire his tenacity.  One thing the short-lived series shares with the reinvented version, currently on TV, is the interesting peripheral characters who serve as Kolchak's allies and sources, like ""Gourdy the Ghoul"" (played by an actor who Odd Couple & Pooh Bear aficionados might recognize) one of the only pre-CSI forensics characters who doesn't eat lunch over the bodies.

 Secondly let me say that I love the Night Stalker Series and was anxious as hell to see it released some day on DVD.

The day that this set came out I bought it and that night started watching it.

Now the bad part: The quality of the film to video transfers are some of the worst I have seen. The light levels of the projection device were so low that all night scenes are so dark that nothing, absolutely nothing can be seen in some parts. Other parts are so dark that only vague shadows can be seen. I took the discs to work and scoped them out. The white and black levels are in acceptable ranges of 100% white and 7.5% for black. This is not the problem. The film to video transfer had insuficiencent projection level to resolve the images.

 Night Stalker looks like a bad 1950's home movie transfer. In the first episode ""The Ripper"" there is an intense battle between the ripper and a squad of police. All kinds of action, jumping shooting and such is going on. I remember it well. On this collection you can't even see what is happening. I showed it to a video expert and friend who had never seen Night Stalker and asked him to tell me what he thought was going on in this scene. He was clueless, it was too dark to see.

 Don't waste your money on this poor, poor cash in. Night Stalker deserves a real high level transfer and remastering, Universal is definitely not universal unless junk is how they define the universal standard. Record the reruns off the Sci Fi channel. These transfers are just fine and you can see everything quite well. Even with the cuts and commercials they are much more enjoyable than this terrible collection.

The episodes are presented underlit to make them appear more ""moody"" and there are no bonus features.  Also, they have not been remastered in any manner whatsoever.  It is sad to see a beloved cult show that inspired the creation of one of the most influential genre shows of the nineties (The X-Files) not treated with any respect whatsoever.  Kolchak fans will snap it up just so they can have it, but the desire to see the show's following and influence acknowledged and praised will remain unfulfilled.",1130457600,8,669,4.893805309734513

The second disc in my set had some major warpage.  It wouldn't even play on my Magnavox DVD player, which, granted, is also a testimonial to how lousy Magnavox DVD players are.  But the disc also exhibited some minor freezing up on my Toshiba player, and would only play correctly on my trusty Panasonic (which seems to play anything you care to feed it).  So I give this set 3 stars, which, considering the quality, is overly generous.

2170841,1,B00066FPCG,"Just for the record I want to make it clear that I am reviewing the DVD box set of the TV series 'Kolchak: The Night Stalker' unlike at least half of the other reviewers on these pages who have reviewed the original Telemovie.

As for my review, let me add my voice to the chorus in saying how wonderful it is to finally have all 20 episodes of the series on DVD. The show has been a favourite of mine since it's initial run in Australia, and has never lost its sparkle, largely due to excellent performances by the cast.

I'm not going to cover the actual content here, other reviews that were on the right subject have done that well enough.

I am VERY disappointed in the manner the series has been released. Universal needs to understand that double sided DVDs are a thing of the past. I hate them; they are difficult to look after, and due to the 4-pass process, more prone to failure.

Surely with the cost of media today, it would not have made a noticeable difference in cost to release these as single sided/dual layer discs. I know MGM released the Telemovies as a Flipper as well, but at least they cleaned up the source material and added some extras. A little effort was shown, unlike Universal's continuing stream of bare bones and 'near enough' attempts.

Picture quality is also of a dubious nature. OK, so the show is called 'The NIGHT Stalker', that doesn't mean you're not supposed see anything!!! The Ripper in the first episode virtually vanishes in his black suit in the dark, to the point where you don't know what's happening at times. Brightness and contrast have been adjusted so that information contained in these dark areas has 'blended together'. No amount of adjustment on your TV will let you see any more.

Universal have done little or nothing to improve the picture quality of these episodes. I have VHS tapes of the show, and while they are of course, lower in resolution, there is virtually NO difference in image clarity. Aside from the hopefully more permanent nature of DVD media, there is little to no reason to spend your money chasing a better image. You won't find it here.

I read in a newsgroup recently that Universal executives have passed an order allowing no more than 2 hours restoration to be done on a single episode from any of their catalogue being released to DVD. That would barely be enough time to identify problems, let alone put them right. For a startling comparison, check out the work that the BBC restoration team are putting into restoring Doctor Who and other titles from their archives ([...] It puts most other studios to shame.

In closing, if you buy this box set, you'll have the series, just not in a condition that it deserves, given the popularity and fan base it has inspired in it's lifetime.

1 star for Universal's handling of the set, 5 stars for the episodes themselves.

  This set states it has  been digitally restored, and the detail looks fine to me. There is a darkness issue, which, were someone to see this series for the first time, might strike them as a flaw. I was 17 when this series was out and already a tube geek. The series was dark on first screening, and it does not look any different now, save that I don't have to adjust rabbit ears for reception.

  Please remember that this series is called ""The Night Stalker."" Almost all of it takes place at night. Even during the day shots, when Kolchak is in the office, the dinginess was intentional. We were not quite a glass and steel built society quite yet. Much of that type of old wooden furniture still adorns the offices to the side of my rathskeller.

 I know that we've come to expect bright lights and big cities in the thirty years since that program was on, but there still remains a charm in those days gone by, with teletypes flooding the floor with paper.

  Before this set I was lucky to have one VHS with two episodes, and the Anchor Bay release of the movies. This set is tops to me, which is evinced by its Amazon rating (as of 10-07-2005).

The video kept ""freezing"" and even reached a point to where I actually had to turn off my dvd player because the remote wouldn't function due to the defective dvd.  I've read up on this set and apparently UNIVERSAL PICTURES has severe quality problems with their box sets of past tv series.

2170846,5,B00066FPCG,"Where else but on DVD would a show that was basically unsuccessful be able to once again be seen in all its glory?  The Night STalker was one of my favorite TV shows of the 1970's despite only lasting 20 episodes.  It would go on to inspire Chris Carter to create the X-Files and now has been revamped in a new show on ABC.

While the TV show never quite achieved the level of greatness of the two made-for-TV films, it still was a fantastic show and one of the very few horror shows that made it to air in the 1970's.  Darrin McGavin was made to play nosy reporter Carl Kolchak who kept finding himself investigating the most bizarre stories and encountering strange creatures...yet invariably his stories would be squelched by his hot-headed editor Tony Vincenzo (Simon Oakland).  Kolchak dressed in his ruffled white suit and straw hat and always found himself at odds with local police officials who didn't appreciate his snooping.  It's still a fantastic show filled not only with chills, but also Kolchak's sarcastic humor which is what is lacking in the new series.

My favorite episodes are:

""The Vampire""  This is basically a sequel to the original Nightstalker movie as one of the vampires victims is ressurected and begins killing victims in LA.

""The Devil's Platform""  CArl discovers that a Senator running for re-election has made a deal with the devil in order to kill off all of his challengers by taking the form of a large dog.

""Bad Medicine"" the Spirit of an Indian Medicine man is killing wealthy socialites for their jewelry.  Kolchak has to somehow destroy the spirit.  The Indian is played by Richard Kiel best known as Jaws in the James Bond films.

""The Spanish Moss Murders""  Call this Kolchak meats SwampThing as a series of grisly murders has taken place leaving the vitims covered in swampy moss.  Carl finds a muck monsters is to blame.

Horror In the Heights""  Kolchak must face a Hindu evil spirit that can take the shape of any person.  Great Episode!

""Demon In Lace""  Kolchak is investigating the deaths of several young college men of apparent heart attacks and learns that a middle-eastern demon called a succubus is responsible.

""The Youth Killer""  Several customers of a dating service are found not only dead, but very old.  Kolchak discovers that helen of Troy is behind the murders and stealing their youth to maintain her own youth and beauty.

Kolchak's frequent run-ins with his boss Tony always made for a good laugh and that banter is sorely missing from the new TV show.  Simply a great show.  The only minor complaint I have is that I wish they had included the two TV movies to make this a totally complete set.",1129161600,2,2664,4.683189655172414
2170847,4,B00066FPCG,"""The Night Stalker"" lasted only one season (from 1974-1975) but despite the cheesy special effects and make-up, it is still very entertaining. Sometimes creepy, sometimes funny, the series usually provides a good combination of chills and laughs. Like most series, it sometimes suffers from poor episodes but for every bad episode like ""Mr. R.I.N.G,"" you have a very good one like ""The Ripper."" My personal favorite episodes are ""The Ripper,"" ""The Vampire,"" ""Horror In The Heights,"" ""The Zombie,"" and ""The Spanish Moss Murders.""

One of the elements that makes the series so memorable are the actors. Darren McGavin stars as the bumbling seersucker suit and straw hat wearing reporter Carl Kolchak, Simon Oakland as his shrill and hilarious boss and the delightful Ruth McDevitt as co-worker Miss Emily. It is hard to see where the inspiration came from for the new ""Night Stalker"" series which stars a deadpan Stuart Townsend, who seems to be channeling the zombies instead of Darren McGavin.

Some of the guest stars include Keenan Wynn, Mary Wickes, Carolyn Jones, Lara Parker, Nina Foch, Phil Silvers, Tom Skerritt, Tom Bosley, Alice Ghostley and Jim Backus.

This dvd boxed set includes all 20 episodes on 3 discs (2 are double-sided). Unfortunately, there are no extra features. An interview with Darren McGavin and a documentary on the history of the show would have been most welcomed. Still, having all the episodes together without the interruption of commercials and cuts is something to cheer about.

All 20 episodes are included:

Disc 1:

#1 ""The Ripper"" - Jack the Ripper revisits the 20th century. This episode is reminiscent of the two tv films that inspired the series - ""The Night Stalker,"" and ""The Night Strangler."" Very creepy, atmospheric and suspensful despite some holes in the plot.

#2 ""The Zombie"" - Voodoo enters the world of organized crime. You will be squirming in your seat when Kolchak attempts to sew up the lips of a sleeping zombie!

#3 ""They Have Been, They Are, They Will Be..."" - Missing animals from the local zoo are found with their bone marrow extracted.

#4 ""The Vampire"" - A Las Vegas call girl is using her customers as her meals. One of my favorite episodes.

#5 ""The Werewolf"" - Kolchak takes a vacation on a cruise ship and so does a werewolf. Not the best episode - the werewolf looks like an actor in a Halloween costume and it seems to end abruptly.

#6 ""Firefall"" - An ""X-Files"" type episode that deals with spontaneous combustion.

#7 ""The Devil's Platform - A politician is gaining prominence after he sells his soul to the devil.

#8 ""Bad Medicine"" - An Indian takes the shape of various animals to kill wealthy women for their jewels.

Disc #2:

#9 ""The Spanish Moss Murders"" - A sleep subject is summoning a swamp monster which is terrorizing Chicago.

#10 ""The Energy Eater"" - A new hospital is plagued by electrocution deaths.

#11 ""Horror In The Heights"" - Senior citizens are being killed by a mysterious beast. One of the series best episodes.

#12 ""Mr. R.I.N.G."" - A killer robot is connected to a top secret government project.

#13 ""Primal Scream"" - A prehistoric creature is brought to life in an oil company's research laboratory.

#14 ""The Trevi Collection"" - A coven of witches infitirate the fashion industry. Lara Parker, who plays the witch Madelaine, played the witch Angelique in the series ""Dark Shadows.""

#15 ""Chooper"" - A headless motorcyle rider wants his head back.

#16 ""Demon in Lace"" - A succubus stalks the campus of Illionois State Technical College.

Disc 3:

#17 ""Legacy of Terror"" - An ancient Aztec mummy is sacrificing guests at a hotel.

#18 ""The Knightly Murders"" - A medieval knight seeks revenge on developers who plan to transform a museum into a nightclub.

#19 ""The Youth Killer"" - Applicants to a dating service are dying from instant aging.

#20 ""The Sentry"" - An ancient lizard-like creature dwells beneath an archives building.",1128902400,33,3930,4.888386123680242

If you have never seen this show, or only know of it because of it's influence on Chris Carter and the ""X Files"" do yourself a favor and pick this up immediately! For years ""Night Stalker"" was a great little secret that only a handful of people you talked to knew about. But almost everyone who has seen the show remembers it fondly. ""Night Stalker"" was so different from everything else put out on TV in the late 70's it transends the ""Charlie's Angels"" decade and still seems fresh and innovative today. It's a shame a quality show like ""Night Stalker"" couldn't survive in a TV world filled with ""Sheriff Lobo"" and ""Three's Company"" type crap.

I see some of the folks complaining about the transfer to DVD, and while it is apparent there has been little if any restoration done to the shows, I can't complain. The grainy, sometimes too dark, transfer actually enhances the show for me. I mean I grew up catching the odd repeat of ""Night Stalker"" late at night on UHF channels, the grainy feel lends itself well to this series, almost giving it a documentary feel at points which actually ups the creepiness level to some episodes. That said, the transfer is not bad. This is the best I have seen this show look.

This DOES have a few advantages - it certainly `ups' the `spook' value of the show and conceals artifacts of some of the more shoddy monster suits used in the series.

2170855,5,B00066FPCG,"Expect to see ""Night Stalker"" return this fall in a new form, produced by the ""X-Files'"" Frank Spotnitz and starring Stuart Townsend. But in all probability, it won't measure up to the original series of ""Kolchak - The Night Stalker,"" a witty short series that has gained cult appeal. At best, it will have its work cut out for it.

In the mid-1970s, after a pair of hit TV movies called ""The Night Stalker"" and ""The Night Strangler, ""Kolchak - The Night Stalker"" debuted. It reintroduced us to Carl Kolchak, a threadbare reporter who is working in Chicago. He also has a tendency to bump into ghoulies, ghosties and things that go bump in the night.

In this series, Kolchak encounters a harrowing series of problems: Kolchak battles bizarre aliens and ""missing link"" primates; a series killer may be Jack the Ripper;  a call girl returns from the dead; a malevolent doppelganger is causing people to burn to death; and voodoo zombies, haunted armor, succubi, werewolves, demons, killer robots, ghosts and gods.

The supernatural is everyday on TV now, with several series (past and present) focusing on everything from A (animals) to Z (zombies). But ""Kolchak - The Night Stalker"" has the advantage of being the grandaddy of them all, with a fresh outlook and plots that owe nothing to anyone.

While the horror parts can be a bit campy, the originality of its plotlines can't be denied. Sure, it mines everything from Aztec gods to voodoo. But it also comes up with plots that no legend could come up with, such as the idea of Helen of Troy still alive and beautiful, and sucking the youth from modern young men. It's brilliant.

It also has what few supernatural series have: a sense of humour. There's that entire episode about a headless motorcycle driver -- a modern update of the ""Headless Horseman,"" maybe? And, of course, the brilliant twist of having diabolical help during a political campaign. Seriously, how could some of these politicians be elected otherwise?

Not to mention the dialogue: we are informed by Kolchak that, ""Captain Leo Winwood and I had a relationship that was long and bloody, like the Crusades, only without the chivalry."" That's not the wittiest line of the series, either.

Darren McGavin -- who twice played a similar character in ""The X-Files"" -- did an excellent job as Carl Kolchak. He plays Kolchak as a crusty, slightly crabby reporter -- an everyman for the supernatural. He's not handsome, not athletic, not charming, and he rubs the cops the wrong way. Therein lies his rough charm.

Only time will tell how good the new series is. But one thing is undeniable: the original ""Kolchak - The Night Stalker"" remains a delicious cult classic. Witty, dark and bizarrely original.",1127606400,11,2719,4.842672413793103

From vampires to zombies to headless motorcycle riders, this show was fantastic. Sadly, it only lasted a season, but the fact that it inspired The X-Files and Kolchak has become a cult icon says a lot about the show.

Kolchak was the everyman. He didn't come out with lines like, ""Well, I know it's a soulless bloodsucker, but I have to do what I have to do.""

No, when he was scared, he screamed. He ran away.  But. in the end, in his own haphazard way, he saved the day.

This show is great for all ages. You could show this to your children without fear of unnecessary sexual inuendoes, or gratuitous gore.

It was good, clean, scary fun.

My favorite line was from The Knightly Murders when Karl had to get info off of a Coat of Arms dealer who was trying desperately to sell him a Coat of Arms.

Dealer: I believe you were decended from the Warsaw Kolchaks. They were Royalty, you know.

Kolchak: Really? My grandmother always told us we were decended from slobs.

I still laugh at the face me makes when he says that!

Darren McGavin rocks to this day!

2170857,5,B00066FPCG,"2006 UPDATE AND FINAL FOLLOWUP:

This is a follow-up to my earlier review. I am going to try and give my thoughts on some of the problems -- some legit, some overstated (IMO) -- with regards to the DVD. I also wanted to give some additional commentary on the episodes themselves. I'll focus on the problems with the DVD quality first, since that is what has set off many people on this site and additional commentary on the episodes of ""Kolchak"" is secondary at this point.

I've had a chance to watch all 20 episodes. It is imperative that once you get the DVD set that you watch all 20 shows as soon as possible (see #5 below).

OK, let's get right to some of the major concerns some have had here with the DVD set:

(1) The Transfer: You can see some grain when you use the zoom function on a DVD but it's not much worse than a SP-recorded VHS or other DVD's I've had made. The TV series transfer is not as good as the 2 telemovies (the Zoom feature shows the increased pixelation on the TV show). You can see some grain on them when you zoom or on a much larger TV. When you look at it normally, remember, ""Kolchak"" is film -- the speed of the frames is 24 frames per second (fps). Video transfers are 30 fps. For this reason, make sure that you have a quality DVD player that can handle 3:2 pulldowns and film-based DVD's. A quality DVD player will improve the playback of the DVD's.

(2) Darkness: We have some experts on this here that talked about the specific transfer process and the problems with dark scenes and lack of light. I don't want to contradict them as they certainly know more than me on the technicals. Let me say this. Yes, the scenes are dark. But the show was shot predominantly at night (one of the reasons Darren McGavin tired of the series rather early) and some of the characters wear dark outfits. Someone commented that in the scene in ""The Ripper"" you wouldn't know what was happening if you hadn't seen the show before. This was the scene at night, with a black-caped Ripper fighting policemen (wearing dark blue uniforms) after he jumped from the building beams. YOU AREN'T GOING TO SEE THAT MUCH DETAIL in that scene. It's a scene shot in the dark with mediocre lighting with characters wearing dark clothes. I don't know if any transfer or digital cleanup would improve it that much. I've seen the episode on TV and it's not any better than the DVD. So I can't believe that the original broadcast or even any ""brightening, improved transfer"" would improve it. That said, I have a.....

(3) Solution: If you have an HDTV or high-end TV, adjust the ""gamma"" control which distinguishes black levels. Adjusting the black levels -- or contrast levels on simpler sets -- will help improve the visibility during dark scenes. DVD's sometimes have different settings (Movie, Standard, Cinema, etc) -- play around with them. To compare and contrast, check out the labyrinth scenes in the movie ""The Rock"" -- if you can make out the water, people, and walls in the murky black, your TV and DVD are doing a good job and you probably won't be able to improve your blacks/gamma/contrast anymore for a DVD like ""Kolchak"".

(4) DVD: If you can, utilize the progressive function on your DVD player. This requires use of component cables, not the standard red/white RCA jacks. The picture is noticeably smoother and improved over both composite and S-Video jacks.

(5) Quality Control: If you can't watch all 20 episodes fairly quickly, I suggest you use medium fast-forward to see if the disks are all working properly. Best to view them all in normal PLAY back, but at a minimum, if you can't do that or are pressed against a return date deadline for exchange, play them back in a ""slow"" fast-forward mode that takes you a bit over an hour or two to watch all 20 episodes. Make sure the disks all work fine -- they may not release these on HDTV so these DVD's will be all she wrote for some time.

Now for some more ""Kolchak"" fun-facts:

(1) Length: All episodes are 50-plus minutes compared to recent showings on Sci-Fi of about 44-45. The first 10 episodes shown in 1974 are actually a minute longer (51 minutes and change) compared to the last half of the series (50 minutes and change) shown in 1975 -- ABC no doubt was trying to make up for the lousy ratings with an extra minute of commercials. Ah, the 1970's...when a 1-hour program only had 9-10 minutes of commercials!

(2) It's great to see the 4 episodes that were butchered by stitching them together into 2 separate movies. I hated seeing the episodes that way -- Darren McGavin had to re-dub commentary to make it seem even halfway intelligible.

(3) Funny Line from ""The Trevi Collection"": ""A small nominal contribution is requested...NOT THAT NOMINAL!""

(4) Scenery: Look at that newsroom. It's how it was in the 1950's up through the 1970's. The show was shown in 1974 and the big teletypes were still the way the news media communicated with each other (besides phones). No internet, no cable news, no iPods, etc.

(5) R.I.P.: Darren McGavin, Simon Oakland and Ruth McDevitt....god bless. Great actors and actress....wonderful acting....hilarious 1-liners.....they are sorely missed.

Jack Grinnage? underrated and underused. His interactions with Darren McGavin are classic.

(6) The Guest Stars: Wow, where to begin. Julie Adams (""Mr. R.I.N.G"") from ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954) Robert Cornwaite (""The Energy Eater"") from ""The Thing From Another World"" (1951), Lara Parker (""The Trevi Collection"") from ""Dark Shadows"", Jamie Farr (""Primal Scream"") from ""M.A.S.H."", Bernie Kopell (""The Trevi Collection"") from ""Get Smart"" and ""Love Boat"", Larry Linville (""Chopper"") from ""M.A.S.H."", Jim Backus (""Chopper"") from ""Mr. Magoo"" and ""Gilligans Island"", Sandra Gould (""Primal Scream"") from ""Bewitched"", Phil Silvers (""Horror in the Heights) from ""Sergeant Bilko"", Tom Skerritt (""Devils Pact"") from ""Aliens"", Kathie Brown (a/k/a Mrs. Darren McGavin) 1960's actress from ""Star Trek"" to ""Bonanza"" (Pernell Roberts love interest), Carolyn Jones (""Demon in Lace"") from ""The Addams Family"")

Then you have the 1970's actors and actresses who seemed to show up in dramas like ""Love Boat"" and ""Fantasy Island"" or sitcoms every other week -- Nita Talbot, Dick Gautier, Barbara Rhoades -- the list goes on and on. There's a star and/or everyday actor or actress that you'll know visually from lots of other 1960's and 1970's appearances in virtually every ""Kolchak"" episode. Some you'll recognize right away. Others you'll be going back to IMDB.com . Try and get those cameos in today's TV series. You can't. Oh yeah,....David Chase from ""The Sopranos"" as a writer, too!

Wow...what a series.
_______________________________________________________

I normally wouldn't write a review before testing or buying the product, but as it was me who contacted Jack Grinnage, an original cast member from KOLCHAK, I wanted to give my thoughts.  Jack Grinnage is an original cast member from the TV series (not the movies) and we are lucky to have him post his thoughts.  I hope Jack will share more thoughts on the series and the DVD release once they are out, either here or on his website.  Thank you, Jack, you have alot of fans here.

Now for the DVD's.  The best thing about the release is going to be the ability to see the shows uncut for the first time in 30 years.  Even CBS when they ran the show late-night in the early 1980's edited out some footage (minimal; they actually had the show run over an hour to minimize edit cuts and maximize commercials).  Seeing KOLCHAK uncut, even without expanded commentary (we can get alot of the behind-the-scenes stuff from the Internet, thankfully) is worth the price of the DVD's.  Regrettably, Darren McGavin is not in good health and is not included in the commentaries.  I wouldn't have minded seeing Jack Grinnage (""Ron Updyke"") or Carol Ann Susi (""Monique Marmelstein"") on the DVD commentaries, but what's done is done.

Now to the key point.  As others have noted, these disks will be dual-sided, which means the opportunity for defects is increased.  They will also be made by Universal, which means the opportunity for defects is almost guaranteed.  If anybody from Universal is reading these posts, take it from the people who will be buying the disks:  we would rather pay a few bucks more for QUALITY DVD's that have been pre-screened for any defects, than get slip-shod quality and saving a few bucks.

Unless Universal wants die-hard KOLCHAK fans returning these sets countless times to get a complete set of defect-free disks, get it right.  The folks who are buying these sets are die-hards who will not tolerate glaring imperfections.  If the DVD's were being purchased by ordinary collectors just interested in an obscure TV show, they might put up with it.  We won't.

I really wish the DVD's were single-sided and had a nice KOLCHAK emblem on the non-playing side.  Would it cost more to produce with more features and doubling the disk quantity?  Sure -- but who here wouldn't pay it?  Universal should know that the people who buy this DVD are going to be the fans of the show, not folks casually strolling down the DVD aisles at Best Buy.  So why not tailor it to us, the fans who have clamored for the show for years?  I think I speak for many when I say we all would pay a few dollars more for higher quality, one-sided, added-commentary DVD's.  But again...what's done is done.

Now that we know what Universal has decided to give us, please, just make sure the disks work and work right from the get-go.  It will ultimately save Universal and the retailers alot of money to get it right the first time -- and save loyal fans like us alot of aggravation.

Here's to one of the best televison shows of all time, which first premiered on Friday the 13th of September, 1974.  Want a good scare?  Well, buy this DVD set...as Carl Kolchak himself said at the end of one of the episodes ""....IF YOU HAVE THE NERVE!!""

10/22/05 POST-PURCHASE UPDATE:  Well, they screwed it up!

It appears that our worst fears have been confirmed and the quality control on these DVD's appears to rival that of the American auto industry in the late 1970's.  Dual-sided disks, missing disks, glitches & freezing up -- it appears that better quality could have been obtained from having someone burn DVD's from the older Kolchak VHS tapes.  So it appears that all we are getting is a poor digital transfer of the series (thankfully, they appear uncut) with plenty of playback problems.

The one bright spot might be to contact Universal -- write or email the corporate guys, not the Video Customer Service folks ! -- and tell them how dissapointed you are with their product and that in the future you will refrain from buying ANY Universal DVD sets given the lack of extras, poor production quality, etc.  Perhaps Universal will be prodded into producing a much-higher quality set of HD-DVD's in a few years when that format starts making the rounds.

I will give a final update once I have seen all the episodes off of the DVDs (assuming they all play on my DVD player, that is).",1126569600,31,11114,4.744415584415584
2170858,5,B00066FPCG,"I had know idea, the impact this show would make on my life.  I was on the ""Hello Dolly"" exterior set at 20th Century Fox when they were filming the undergound city.  I had know idea that I would be part of the series.  The casting of Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland is pure genius.  The movies where the best thing on Televison.  They should have been movies.  Watching the movies and Darren's performans proves what a seasoned actor can bring to a role.  Darren's exstensive theatre backround.  Is very apparent, his timing is superb and his team mate Simon Oakland puts the candle on the cake.  If you haven't seen these two movies buy them, rent them. But see them.  Sincerely Jack Grinnage",1126569600,39,695,4.532258064516129
2170859,3,B00066FPCG,"You're looking at the BIGGEST kolchak fan anywhere!! It's the greatest show of its kind PERIOD.  It set the mold for the X-Files and other ""what if?"" kinds of shows. Darren McGavin is a genious on this show. It has a classic feel, a scariness, and suspense that is amazing.  I adore every episode!

That being said, UNIVERSAL MAKES SUCKY DVD SETS!! I hope they read this!! I bought a Columbo Season 3 set that was defective and unwatchable THREE TIMES OUT OF THREE!! I have read countless reviews of UNIVERSAL sets that were messed-up! They put the DVD's back to back and in the manufacturing process the DVD's get defects, mainly in the center of the DVD and they freeze up or, in my case three times, just won't even play!!

I bought these all on VHS a year ago off Ebay brand new still in the plastic from Columbia House. Until I read PLEEEENNNTY of good reviews about this DVD, I don't plan on even coming close to buying it. Universal has burned me enough!!

But, Kolchak fans, let's at least rejoice someone is putting this gem of a TV series on DVD, at least they're trying! Let's see if they produce!

My favorite episodes while we're at it:

Legacy of Terror: Aztec mummy and a cult of ancient Aztec worshippers. Great episode. Eric Estrada is cheesy as ever but plot is SUPERB! very clever, end is a blast!!

Firefall:  The dopple-ganger episode!  I love this one!! A dead arsonist becomes the evil double counterpart of a orchestra maestro!

The Knightly Murders

The Wherewolf

Heck, they're all good!!

Of course the pilot episode:  Night Stalker is the cream of the crop!!",1126396800,14,1586,4.554770318021202
2170860,4,B00066FPCG,"Like other reviewers, I am thrilled to see a favorite TV show from my childhood finally released. I was disappointed to see that it is Universal doing the releasing. Universal has released many popular classic TV shows recently. I myself purchased Dragnet, and Quincy M.E. Both have numerous technical problems, such as skipping and freezing. After trying them on multiple DVD players, and returning them to the store for new copies, I STILL do not have playable discs! In reading other reviews on Amazon, numerous folks have had the same problems with these and other Universal releases (such as Emergency, Adam-12, etc.)

Come on, Universal...PLEASE get your act together! Until I read that the mastering problems have been resolved, I won't be spending my money.",1125964800,15,765,5.12

I hope ABC gives it a chance to build a fanbase and doesn't get cancel happy on it the way the network did on the original show. I own the original video tapes of this show and will grab the dvds up as soon as they hit the street. As I said before this was a great series, so pick up these dvds and you'll understand the hype and why we are all so excited about this.  Thanks for your time.",1125878400,8,564,3.9911504424778763

2170863,5,B00066FPCG,"I used to stay up late at night waiting for Kolchak to come on when it originally aired in the 70's. Now, it's FINALLY coming to us on DVD.

I must have sent countless e-mails to all the major and minor DVD authoring houses trying to convince them that this show had to come out and see the light of day. I only got one reply back and that was to tell me that their marketing team would look into it. Guess what? Nada!

It's my opinion that if it weren't for the new Kolchak show that is supposed to air in October, this set wouldn't be out on DVD until hell froze over. I sincerely mean that. Too many damn corporate execs sticking their noses where it doesn't belong.

With that said, I hope you enjoy the show because I know I will.",1125273600,6,735,4.090277777777778
