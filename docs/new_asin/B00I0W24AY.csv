6246310,1,B00I0W24AY,"Too fast. This is advanced plus. Not for those of us who like precise bar work at it's most effective MODERATE pace. This jumps from one workout to another without a preintroduction to the next move. There are WAY TOO MANY participants, and you find yourself desperately trying to stay focused on the beginner level which is beginner for ADVANCED before superhuman. Kudos to these humans with amazing lung capacity and muscle performance. NOT for a normal human.",1426636800,4,462,4.935897435897436
6246311,5,B00I0W24AY,This is such a great workout!! I have exercised most of my life (about 27 years) and I felt as though I got a really good workout from this. I have so many different programs from moderate to advanced and I like to try something new quite frequently. It breaks up the monotony and boredom from only having one specific exercise program. I think Tanya has great enthusiasm and it's not boring. You will get a great workout with this and you will feel it!! I will buy more of her programs in the future.,1425254400,7,501,4.28421052631579

6246313,5,B00I0W24AY,"I love Physique 57. Such a great workout, absolutely no dread factor. The longer I've been doing it, the more challenging it becomes.",1421539200,2,133,4.826086956521739
6246314,4,B00I0W24AY,Very nice.,1406937600,,10,4.5
6246315,5,B00I0W24AY,"Just when I thought I couldn't love P57 workouts any more, I tried this workout.  In some ways I find it harder than Volume 1.  And I found Volume 1 pretty challenging!  I think its because I tried this workout after doing Volume 1 and the other P57 workouts for several weeks.  I really focused on my form, so when I was doing the moves in this workout, I was really working.

This is taught by Tanya Becker, the founder of Physique 57. As with the other Physique 57 workouts, there are two modifiers.  One is doing an easier version and the other is doing a more advanced version of the moves.  All you need for the workouts are:
light and medium weights, playground ball, chair, mat and thick cushion.

The workout breakdown:

WARM UP (10 minutes)
Unlike most other barre workouts, the crew is using heavier weights for arm work.  They are using 8 pounds and 5 pounds.  Needless to say I was using 5 pounds and 3 pounds. Mmm, I consider myself an advance exerciser, who can normally lift pretty heavy weights.  I cant do so with this high rep, endurance type work.  I just love working my muscles in new ways!

STANDING LEGS (15 minutes)
I had an aha moment during this work.  I finally (!) got the ball squeeze.  In the past, I was so busy trying to move my legs up and down and keeping my balance, I couldn't also manage to actually squeeze the ball.  It was all I could do to keep it between my legs.  Well, that extra little squeeze makes a big difference!  My inner things are still feeling it a few days later.
I am still working on the thigh dancing.  I can barely lift above my feet and my thighs are talking to me.

SEAT  WORK (12 minutes)
My favorite move in this section is the swirl, where you are standing on one leg, with the other leg bent and you are swirling your leg down to your knee and back behind you.  I feel so graceful doing this move.  Well, I probably don't look so graceful, but its what is inside that counts, right?

MAT WORK (13 minutes)
Now it is time to work your abs.  The famous pretzel move is in here.  I love this move because I feel like I have to really use my brain to focus, as well as using my muscles.

BACK WORK (3 minutes)
Tanya calls it back dancing  I love that name.  It is basically bridge pose where you move your hips up and down.
You finish up with swimmer, which works your lower back.

STRETCH (4 minutes)
You are stretching in between sections throughout the workout, but this end stretch feels extra nice because youve worked hard and your muscles are really warm.

The 57 minutes flew by and I was sorry to see the workout end.

People often ask me which Physique 57 workout I would recommend.  I say, All of them!",1403740800,22,2675,4.252485089463221
6246316,5,B00I0W24AY,"I really started my serious barre journey with the Physique 57 workouts.  I had dabbled in barre before this, but once I started the Physique 57 workouts, I was hooked.

I have all 6 volumes in the set and every time I do a workout, I say to myself, ""this is my favorite workout.""  So, now I have 6 favorite workouts.

This Volume 1 is taught by Tanya Becker.  It also has a bonus 5 minute leg and glute section.  So, if your legs aren't fried enough by the regular workout, you can try this bonus.

All you need for the workout:  a chair or barre, a playground ball, light weights, mat and thick cushion or towel.  There are two modifiers, one showing an easier version of the moves and the other, showing a more advanced version.  I was following the easier modifier and I was still very challenged!  And I consider myself an advanced exerciser.

The workout:

WARMUP (10 minutes)
Yes, so Tanya calls this a warm-up, but you'll be breathing heavy and your core will talk to you.  You are also doing upper body work with semi-light weights.  It is just enough to get your muscles warm and your heart pumping.

LEGS AND GLUTES (25 minutes)
You move quickly from the barre to the floor and back to the barre.  There is no down time.  The hardest section for me was the thigh dancing.  I thought I had strong thigh muscles, but I can barely get my legs off my feet to do these moves.  I love it!

CORE (17 minutes)
In a word, ""ouch.""  I was following the modifier doing the easier moves and my core was still talking to me.

BACK AND BRIDGE WORK (7 minutes)
No body part is left untouched in this workout.  You will do some bridge variations, as well as some low back work.

STRETCH (5 minutes)
You are stretching periodically throughout the workout, but this last stretch is an extra treat.  I love watching Tanya, she is so graceful.  I like to think that I look just like her, but that's a pipe dream.  It's fun to imagine though.

BONUS MOVES (5 minutes)
Tanya takes us through an extra challenge for your thigh and seat.  You're standing beside your chair and doing variations on leg raises to the front and then doing leg extensions behind you.  You then do the other leg.  Yes, the bonus section is short, but intense.

Why I love this workout:

* It is truly a total body workout.  Even though you are using light weights, all the planks also work your arms.

* Tanya.  Yes, she talks at hyper-speed, but it is all part of the high energy feel of the workout.

* The Bonus Moves.  I love the little 5 minute session, it's intense enough to give me an extra pump, but not so long that I feel I can't do all the moves.  Although, I must admit, my leg is not nearly as high as Tanya's.

The only very minor annoyance with this workout is the thick cushion.  I'm never quite sure where to place it behind my back and I'm not sure exactly what it is supposed to accomplish.

All in all, I highly recommend this workout.  Even the advanced exercisers among us will be humbled!",1403395200,18,2976,4.30379746835443
6246317,4,B00I0W24AY,"I'd been curious about P57 for a long time, and when I saw this DVD at a thrift store, I quickly bought it.

One of my favorite things about this particular DVD is the music. It definitely has some of the best workout music of any DVD I've tried.  Not only that, but the music is choreographed to the workout, which I've experienced in a barre class, but never on any workout DVDs.

The set has an industrial look, but at the same time, it's fun and energetic. The lighting seems to be strategic and well though out.

The workout itself is good. I like the mix of weights with barre work. Lots of isolated moves.  It is nearly 57 minutes long though.  And for that amount of time, I want more of a calorie burn. I can't imagine that this workout burns a lot of calories, even though it does use weights and intervals.  I liked how you have 10-minute segments and then recovery segments.  It's an interesting mix.

The instructor, Tanya, is very upbeat. However, my biggest complaint about this DVD is her talk of looking good in a bikini and such talk.  Yes, she talks about getting stronger and fitter, but there's too much talk about how you'll look for my preference.

Equipment needed:  a barre or chair, exercise mat, playground ball, and weights.  I used a pilates ball and a tall bar stool.

I don't know that I'll do this often. Most likely, I'll do it on a light day, when I want a mix of cardio and weights, but I don't want to exert myself with heavy weights and/or running.",1398556800,11,1485,4.352727272727273
6246318,5,B00I0W24AY,"Oh, this is going to be my summer workout alright. I seriously think my butt looked better after doing this just once. I'm not a ballerina nor have I done barre, but I've never experienced a workout that focused so much on exhausting (then stretching) the hips and thighs without building bulk like running, squats, and weight lifting can do. I describe this as a combination of weight training, barre, belly dancing, a little kickboxing, and serious abs. I've shared the video with my sisters and two friends, and they all agree. I'd love to get the 30 minute version so I can start doing this as often as possible. Work it!!! Highly recommended.",1398211200,12,647,4.684210526315789
6246319,5,B00I0W24AY,"This is a tough, but very effective workout.  I have only done it 4 times, but am seeing a big difference already, particularly with my abs.
As one reviewer mentioned, it is the Bar Method on crack!  You get a super cardio workout along with amazing toning.

Is Tanya obnoxious?  Yes.  Do I care?  No.  I love the results!

I will post an update after I have been doing Physique 57 for a couple of months.",1485820800,5,405,4.2368421052631575
6246320,5,B00I0W24AY,"I now understand why P57 is so highly recommended! I've been doing various barre-style workout DVD's for nearly 2 years now, and I'd consider myself at least at an intermediate level. Everytime I'm ready for something new, I check out blogs to see who recommends what, and why. Every single blogger has recommended P57, for pretty much the same reason = an amazing workout. Simply based on cost, I typically pick another one of their choices (P57 is a little more costly than most others), but recently, I decided it was time to try out P57 and see what the hype is about. And I get it now. The instructor and music are great and motivating, and the workout itself had me sweating, shouting for mercy, and feeling fantastic by the end! I love it, and I'm totally hooked. I'm going to use this DVD to get ready for summer (oh hey, bikini body), because I can tell it's going to WORK!",1484179200,6,882,4.450617283950617
6246321,4,B00I0W24AY,tough to learn all the very intricate moves. would be better if the thing had chapters or cuing to get to various exercises individually.,1475625600,,137,4.75
6246322,5,B00I0W24AY,"This is a long workout, but I love Physique 57!  The music is fantastic and it keeps you going and going, shaking and shaking.",1472342400,,126,4.25
6246323,5,B00I0W24AY,"This is by far my favorite P57 DVD. It is definitely challenging and even after a year of doing it consistently, I did not plateau. Even though the workout is divided into sections that are designed to work different body parents (e.g. arms, thighs, seat and abs sections), you will find yourself using your core throughout the workout. After doing this workout consistently, I definitely noticed total body results.

The only downside to this DVD is that, unlike classes that offer variety and a different workout every time, you will eventually get sick of it. I found that it took a lot longer to get sick of this DVD than other workout DVD's because it is so fast-paced and you don't repeat moves. After about a year and a half of doing it 3-4 times per week, I did start to get sick of it. At this point, I recommend streaming their workouts from the website to give yourself some variety. Still, I find myself coming back to this workout time and time again because it is so challenging and fun.

The instructor is high-energy, which I like, but I could see how some people might get a bit tired of the jokes. I think, however, most people could get past this for the fun workout and awesome results. Seriously, after a couple weeks of this DVD I saw awesome results and hopefully you will too!",1472169600,2,1300,4.504237288135593

6246325,5,B00I0W24AY,"I workout regularly. I've gone to a variety of classes at the gym, and when our instructor gave us the Physique 57 Barre workout I was impressed! I thought it would be easy, but, even though the moves are not difficult, the combination of moves and the duration really strengthened my core!  I knew it was something I wanted to add to my workouts for variety. I have not been disappointed. If you have an hour to workout and want variety, this is a good choice.",1471651200,2,461,4.3604651162790695
6246326,5,B00I0W24AY,"I started barre classes with the Bar Method when I worked nearby a studio.  After a location move, I no longer worked or lived near a Bar Method studio so I tried the two other studios that were near where i live--the Dailey Method, which is similar and Pure Barre which is similar but neither won me over to join.  So i've relied on my Bar Method dvd.  I decided to try Physique 57 based on reviews and this workout is no joke.  Bar Method involves more stretching breaks, which i think i prefer, and is more of a true ballet style routine, which i also love.  However, I love Physique 57 for the opposite--i liked that there was a more jazzy/modern dance element to the routine and it definitely got my heart rate up!  Holy cr*p.  You start off with a warm-up/upper body routine---they used 5 lb and 8lb weights. umm i used 3 lbs. I probably could do 5lbs but i wasn't sure so i started off with 3 and still felt it. i was downright out of breath after that segment! then you move into thighs, then butt, then abs, then stretching.  the moves are similar to any other barre workout but with a little more cardio elements.  I feel like i am in halfway decent shape but i could not keep up!  so it is a challenging workout. But what i love so much about barre workouts and Physique 57 is no different--there's no high impact and you can do what you can as far as reps go or do the modified/beginner version of the moves as Tanya shows with the beginner student. I injured  my hip/si joint from high impact cardio and running and the exercises in barre classes, including in the video (like clam and backdancing) are exercises in my rehab so I'm going to be alternating Bar Method and Physique 57 videos forever now.  Love Tanya's energy and I'd love to take a class if I am ever in New York or La or if they expand to Chicago.",1471132800,7,1826,4.245664739884393
6246327,5,B00I0W24AY,"I have never reviewed anything but I love this workout so much I felt compelled to tell people. I just had my second child 4 months ago and have been doing this workout as well as the express workout several times a week for 2 months and I'm very happy with the results. I have done P90X, run countless miles on the treadmill, and have gone to the gym for years. Nothing has ever been so effective for toning my thighs and I'm just starting to see some abdominal muscles emerging from the jelly-like saggy mess of my post natal stomach. This workout is hard. You will be shaking and uncomfortable while you're doing it but you feel great afterward. It's been 2 months and I still get sore but I'm amazed at how much stronger I am.

6246333,3,B00I0W24AY,"Pros:
This video gives a good workout,
The instructor has good energy and tries to motivate you through it,
Time goes by pretty fast.

Cons:
The instructor often sounds like a 50s housewife and focuses too much on how great you'll look once you get in shape vs. how strong or healthy you'll be.  She'll say a move will ""get rid of that fat roll"" when we all know it can't.  It can and does strengthen the muscle beneath it.
She also sounds like an infomercial sometimes when she tries to sell her technique.
Some of the moves aggravate my lower back.",1462924800,8,550,4.372549019607843

I gotta say it works thighs and buttocks with the standing at the barre moves. (My favourite parts).

I dnot like much their abs or arms, because with ballet beautiful I get much more reps and different moves, with no cushioning or ball help. SO TOUGHER.

Then the arms works is brief, I honestly do not like to constantly do all that plank, but it is effective enough.

For the butt work, is not enough because apart from the plies, the legs releve and tendu are Minimal . Not enough so I integrate it with ballet beautiful.

All in all is good workout and you feel the burn, you do get lean and toned fast. I agree is a good one. For the legs work and calves is great.",1456444800,4,814,4.232258064516129

I found this instructor to be very annoying, also from a Pilates point of view and from a Personal Training point of view some of the moves can hurt clients. She describes a move being ""ok if you feel it in your back"", it's not ok! Booty Barre modifies the same move to a standing position so it is not felt in the client's back. I really wanted to like this video but I did not. So far my favorite Barre videos are Booty Barre, Barre Amp'd, and Barre 3.",1456185600,7,613,3.991869918699187

I do enjoy the longer slower stretch sections of bar method but physique 57 is overall superior. You get cardio benefits, great music, and truly life and body transforming exercises. I am so firm and feel so strong after only 2 weeks. This dvd is my favorite of the 4 I own (classic 1, and the two 30 minute ones). In plan to try and he cardio and other 30 min ones too.

Since I don't have a Physique 57 location nearby, I decided to give the DVD a shot.  Am so pleased I did!  It's a great full-body workout that really does do the job.  I thought that nearly an hour would be brutal, but as others have said, it gets you so motivated that the time really does fly by.  I'm 51 and already work out regularly at the gym, so I didn't expect to notice a big difference after using it, but I have!  Things are definitely starting to tone up on my arms, legs and bottom.

I ordered this DVD with great trepidation .. I have a pile of Dvd's that are collecting dust! And who has 57 minutes?! I can barely do the Dvd's that promise to give you a great workout in 20 minutes! Well let me tell you that 1) the time flies by 2) I have been doing it for 3 weeks - 2x's a week, and I definitely see a difference! I got my waist back, and I am more toned and lean. It WORKS! And it's FUN! I just wish the visual was a little better, because I have a hard time figuring out some of the moves .. Like the ""swirl"" but it's fine. I also love that there are stretches in between - I think it makes a big difference. I used to take an Barre class at my gym and I couldn't move for days after taking it I was so sore . In Physique 57 Tanya makes sure to stretch after each part... My only advice is to get the right ball. I tried to cheap out and bought a regular playground ball. It was too big and too firm.

If you are motivated to workout I highly recommend ~ I modify so as not to bend my knee too much yet I still feel like I'm getting as good, if not better, workout then I did when i wasable to lift weights and use the elliptical.",1433289600,2,589,4.113043478260869
6246355,5,B00I0W24AY,"I love this barre workout, I loved it so much I got the book.
Tanya is amazing and I don't know why some people get annoyed with her.
As you are feeling the burn, and you will with these isometric exercises, her
humor cracks me us as I'm feeling death. I love her.
It totally works your whole body, your arms, butt, thighs, oh boy,
you move so fast from one exercise to the other that you get cardio.
When we do the core, not only do I feel it in my core, but inner thighs because
I have weak inner thighs, and the core seems to target them.
If you want a great full body barre workout, you won't go wrong with this one.
I have a lot of barre workouts and Iwork them on a day basis, this is my Saturday workout.
I also do Lastics because it gives your body a full stretch which is needed after the isometrics.",1433116800,6,809,4.0

8638106,3,B00I0W24AY,"I was looking for a simple (note I did not say easy but simple) workout I could do at home to tone and build muscle after loosing 40 pounds.  This is not it.  The positions for the excercises are overly complicated and the instructor goes way too fast explaining them.  Then there's the equipment needed: 2 sets of weights, a playground ball, excercise mat, a cushion and a barre.  Don't have an excercise barre?  Be prepared to rearrange your living room.  I gave 3 stars because it does work your muscle groups very well.  I just think its a better workout for people who have taken a barre class in person.",1528329600,,609,4.4324324324324325

8638108,2,B00I0W24AY,"It was ok. A straight barre workout is better. Her voice and teaching mannerisms ( if that makes sense) were annoying. I think in an in-person class her person might be more engaging, but through video---odd.",1508371200,,208,4.805555555555555
8638109,5,B00I0W24AY,"This is one tough workout and I've been a consistent exerciser for decades. Only drawback is that you need a workout ball and a decent chair for the bar. The ab part is amazing and again, super difficult.",1501200000,,204,4.394736842105263

8638112,5,B00I0W24AY,"I was skeptical after reading the reviews.  Several stated how annoying the instructor's singing is during difficult parts of the workout.  Not going to lie, it really is annoying.  Those comments were good to know up front.  I made up my mind not to let that bother me.  At first I thought I would never get to a point where I felt this video would be a benefit.  I've been consistent doing this video at least 2 times a week.  I can actually feel the improvement now in my abs, arms, butt and hamstrings.  If you are looking for a challenging full body workout and have an hour, I can recommend it.",1492300800,4,600,4.294642857142857

My thighs and glutes are screaming by the end of the workout.  The workout is streamlined and works biceps, back, and triceps (with weights) and then works thighs, glutes, and abs (without weights).  This is a great 57 minute workout without all of the high intensity !!!!",1487203200,,430,4.618421052631579
