8601868,4,B00E6896WA,"I only ordered this for A Man Called Horse.  I am  very interested in American Indian spirituality.  I also like true not fictionalized American Indian storys.  I really wish someone would put out  a trilogy for the A Man Horse series at a REASONABLE PRICE  : )  Another movie with some Am. Ind. spirituality is Chief
Crazy Horse.  The other  John Wayne movie was good too just not what I bought this for.",1477008000,,405,4.438356164383562
8601869,4,B00E6896WA,"Great Western and one of Wayne's better performances. The character of Big Jake McCandles is reminescent of Rooster Cogburn of ""True Grit"" and Jakes humor is like Rooster's too...listen for his use of ""ostentious display"" instead of ""ostentatious"".... The story (one of the bloodier of Wayne's Westerns and it probably should carry a PG rating instead of the G it carries) is reminescent of ""The Searchers"" in that a child (Jakes grandson and Wayne's youngest son, Ethan) has been kidnapped and Wayne and company head out in pursuit. In addition to Ethan, Wayne's oldest son, Patrick, also plays a prominant role. I always thought Patrick had the looks for stardom, but his father could act rings around him and he just never clicked outside the Duke's movies. One of Wayne's best personal friends, Bruce Cabot, who frequently appeared in his films, plays Jake's Indian sidekick, Sam Sharpnose. Richard Boone, who could play villians just as well if not better, than the white hat role, is delightfully villainous and leads the gang of outlaws who kidnap Little Jake. Maureen O'Hara, still beautiful in her late 40s, has an all-too-brief role as Jakes estranged wife. This was the last of 5 Wayne/O'Hara collaborations. The film moves smartly toward a satisfying conclusion, with one of the best closing gunfights in a Wayne Western. John Fain's (Boone) final words to Big Jake are, ""I thought you were dead"", a line that recurrs several times in the movie...to which Jake replies, ""Not hardly!""; also a recurring humorous line. Great Western; great Wayne performance. Highly recommended.",1475971200,,1588,5.111538461538461
