8071361,2,B000A0GXJC,This wasn't that great. Poor lighting was it's biggest problem. But I have seen worse movies. For the dollar something plus shipping I'm not gonna complain too much. The best part of the movie in my opinion was the music. The main character was cool and reminds me of someone I'd probably hang out and drink beer with.,1253923200,,318,4.5
8071362,2,B000A0GXJC,"its actually pretty bad,its just way to boring,thiers really nothing specail about the movie whats so ever,only thing good about the movie was the trailer i saw on the internet,which was done very good,but the movie is just straight bad!
only thing that looks good was the make-up job looks very good!
i give it 2 stars for good gore,but the movie just aint worth the time",1205020800,,372,4.567164179104478
8071363,2,B000A0GXJC,The people stand around and talk.  This could have been good but the script is very bad.  And i'd be damned if the zombies are everywhere well hey lets crawl under this house and see whats going on.... sheeeesh  the music was pretty good and if they had spoke how people speak.,1166227200,,277,4.288461538461538
8071364,1,B000A0GXJC,"I wanted to give this one a chance. And I like to see a young director and cast try to make something special without a lot of cash, but this just looks poor. The makeup for the zombies isn't too bad, until bad camera work shows the end of the makeup about an inch before the hair on the back of their heads. Looks really bad considering the makeup is a blue color, then you see white skin then hair. Thats just for beginners, the camera used for this film was a good idea(grainy 70's look), but please come up with better actors and record the sound better. You can't hear it unless you crank the volume. The people who gave this a good review on the box, should be in jail. I do not recommend this one, unless your last name is Bin Laden. One more thing, there is frontal nudity in this movie and its not the good kind, its a guy.",1162512000,6,832,4.079268292682927
8071365,1,B000A0GXJC,"Ok, just in general I am a junkie of many things zombie. This sucks. Don't bother with it.

Plot Spoiler: Do not read if you haven't seen or just ate.

One guy gets his schlong bitten off because he tried to have sex with a zombie. Very very graphically. Even for me that was over the line in how it was done. Fake but *shiver*.",1157587200,5,328,4.030769230769231
8071366,1,B000A0GXJC,"Seriously, how did this movie get a distribution deal?

I've seen better production values and far superior acting in family vacation films.

This wasn't even so bad it was good.

Worst movie since Forsaken. Don't spend your time even reading the reviews about it.",1156204800,3,264,4.954545454545454
8071367,1,B000A0GXJC,"If i could give negative stars i would. This is terrible. I saw this at a friends house. I can forgive the crappy Cinematography as Artsy, but the overwhelmingly terrible Acting, Dialouge, Sound, Editing, and lack of an interesting plot just make this a punishment to see. Dont waste your money on this. Look for something else.",1156204800,4,328,4.771929824561403
8071368,4,B000A0GXJC,"Ok so how many 8mm features have there been that have distro????  Maybe 2, still as zombie movies go it ain't bad.  The effects are pretty well handled and the acting isn't horrible.  To boot the 8mm give the film a look not seen on any other movie out there, even DND.  At times though the 8mm look seems more home movieish but it doesn't ruin th movie.  Final verdit?  Buy it, rent it, steal it but DEFINATLY worth a look.",1135036800,2,424,4.172839506172839
