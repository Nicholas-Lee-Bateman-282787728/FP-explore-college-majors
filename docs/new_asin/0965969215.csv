8277963,4,0965969215,"There is very little film footage available on the Maine Two-Footers.  This film was made just before closure and shows the system before its closure.  Linwood Moody is the supreme biographer of the Maine Two-Footers.
The re-edit improves the film, which previously had sections printed in reverse, and is in DVD not videotape.

8277964,4,0965969215,"I really like the video clips, but I do wish it was vocally narrated. I recently was in Maine, doing a railroad tour. Phillips ME has a real good operation up there, focused on the Sandy River. They have inspired my Maine Two Footer model railroad.",1363392000,,248,4.413043478260869
8277965,5,0965969215,Very nice DVD. Many improvements over the standard VHS. Added footage is excellent. Picture is clear and can make out more details than on VHS. Added music is nice but repetitive.,1204934400,,179,4.806451612903226
