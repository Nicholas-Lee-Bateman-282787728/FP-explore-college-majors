4961872,5,B00668IEZ8,"While there is no way to capture the decay of the American public schools in a 90 minute film, this movie provides an excellent and very accurate picture of the trials, successes, tribulations and joys of being in the teaching profession in this country.  Following several teachers as they make various journeys in different parts of the country, this movie provides a consistent and fairminded view of teaching in the USA.  I've been a teacher for over 20 years, and it is a disgrace that educating our children has come to a point of such low regard in our society.  Why does our nation feel we are doing a great job of educating students, yet we rank well down the scale in international comparisons?  Could it simply be how we value education and our teachers?  Watch this movie with a teacher and see what you think.",1345593600,4,822,4.602739726027397
4961873,1,B00668IEZ8,"I wanted to like this movie. I feel that the issues they are discussing are important. The idea of the movie was excellent, but the realization is really upsetting..
Basically, there was no real discussion of a variety of problems that educational system faces nowadays. The one problem the movie was discussing over and over again was long hours, little money. That's it. Which is exactly why it was so boring and so repetitive.
And it represents only one way to look at thing. This lopsidedness makes it looks like a really long commercial promoting teachers - nothing wrong with that per se, but then again, I paid money to watch that, and I feel I should get something a little more interesting for my dollar.",1336262400,6,713,4.666666666666667
4961874,3,B00668IEZ8,"Teaching is a tough job. That much is made clear in the documentary American Teacher. It's a job that pays highly-educated professionals very little for such long hours. Teaching also requires great personal sacrifice, such as spending individual funds on classroom supplies, forgoing family time to attend school functions or grade papers, and even working a second or third job in order to barely cover the expenses of an average family.

The documentary brings attention to the popular public opinion that teachers have short workdays and lots of vacation time. In reality, the presumed workday of a teacher is 10-11 hours long, with another 15 hours spent on planning and grading at home, for a whopping 65-hour work week. As a former English teacher with six years of classroom experience, I can vouch for the accuracy of that estimate. One former teacher in the video referred to ""the insane work hours"" required.

Another popular opinion is that ""anybody can teach."" The Harvard grad featured in the video then asks, ""Well who would you want to teacher your children then?"" It's important to note that same teacher now works in a position at a charter school that opted to pay its teachers a yearly salary of $125,000 by finding ways to reallocate public funds.

Just a few enlightening statistics on the teaching profession included:
* 31% hold second jobs
* 62% hold second jobs if coaching and advising are taken into consideration.
* 46% quit before their fifth year.
* 20% quit at urban schools every year
* 14% less in pay is made compared to professions that require similar education.

At only 80 minutes, what American Teacher does not make clear are ways to alleviate the profession's woes. High attrition rates carry costs for everyone, economically and intellectually. An additional 30 minutes of footage would have provided the time to start a much needed exploration.

A brief comparison is drawn between America's school system and more successful systems from Singapore, South Korea, and Finland. The valuation of teachers must encompasses selective recruiting, funded training, competitive compensation, a professional working environment, cultural respect, being career-oriented, as well as looking at a school's annual teaching turnover.

The video ends by pointing out that despite challenges, educators persevere. I beg to differ. The profession is in shambles.

4961875,2,B00668IEZ8,"I was surprised after watching this film to find that it was released in 2011.  The characterization of teacher problems or issues seems from a different decade.  There is no mention of being judged by No Child Left Behind scores when it does not even measure actual growth of students.  There is no mention of the looming ""value-added"" evaluation of teachers to be determined by junk science algorythms which no layman can even decipher enough to demonstrate the flaws.  There is no mention of how in many, if not most, places the autonomy of the teacher is diminishing.  It is becoming about program implimentation and so a good teacher's talents are wasted on following unproven scripts or strategies created by ""experts"" who may never have taught a day in their lives.  Arne Duncan boosted his ""educational experience"" by explaining on a radio show that he helped out a few years with his mother's school.

Instead the focus is on money and time, which does really give fodder to those that would see teachers as whining.  It is true that teachers have ample opportunity to look at their prospective earnings and decide if it is a good deal for them.  If the film wanted to talk about the unfairness of compensation, they should have looked at the public's reaction to pensions.  It seems that many would be comfortable taking a teacher's pension away right now.  The unfairness in this situation is that the public basically made a bargain with that teacher.  Be a teacher and you will not be greatly paid, but you will get decent benefits like a retirement program: you won't end up rich but you won't end up destitute.  Now the public acts like that was some sort of gift to be taken away at their whim.  Many do not realize that teachers pay into that retirement system with their pay like others do with social security and that this pension is a program instead of the social security system for them.  Changing the bargain mid stream when a teacher has already comitted to the profession and cannot go back to the opportunities forfeited would indeed be economically unfair.  I don't know if better salary would really attract better candidates.  The profession relies on a lot of interpersonal skills which higher education isn't particular well suited to teach. But what teachers or those that sympathize with them often do not understand is that if the salary had been way higher, the competition would have been greater and they may not have been the one selected to teach.

The time that the film argues teachers put into a day seems quite exaggerated.  The film does not point out that teachers are supported by contract as to how many hours they are required to work.  Yes, many teachers do work more than contract.  It can be debated whether that extra work organizing a library, grading homework, or any work not with a student really has any effect on student performance.  However, to suggest that all teachers work a minimum of 65 hours a week seems a great exageration.  I have been extremely successful working much less than that, albeit more than contract hours.  And I have seen many good teachers do the same.

I don't know that the film also really presented any examples of great teaching.  I did not see any impressive evidence.  The film relies on testimonials, but most parents and students have something good to say about their own teacher.  I've seen terrible teachers whose students love them dearly.  This just isn't evidence.  I think one or two teachers may have received an award.  These as well are typically extremely subjective.  There is no competition.  An administrator or several administrators select the teacher on a bunch of vague criteria which means that they can pick anyone they want.  What do you think the chances are that they would select the teacher who most effects student performance if that teacher disagreed with their program?  The teacher who graduated from Harvard uses her degree as evidence that she is a great teacher.  I don't know if she is or isn't, but I know this is not evidence of it.

In the end, most teachers will like this overly simplistic and sympathetic look at teachers.  But the film does not do teachers any favors.  It does not focus the public on the more relevant current issues.  And it does not present evidence, save perhaps the international comparison, to change anyone's mind about teaching issues.

Kindergarten Teacher, 14 years experience, student scores that put others to shame, and a Harvard degree that means nothing.",1333152000,16,4522,4.798188874514877
4961876,5,B00668IEZ8,"I really enjoyed this film.  I think it creates a realistic picture of what teachers go through on a daily basis, and the sacrifices they make between school , personal life and family. I highly recommend this film.",1332115200,2,215,4.657894736842105
4961877,2,B00668IEZ8,"Several teachers are profiled. Even though they all knew how hard teaching would be and how little it paid they don't mind complaining about how hard it is and how poor they are. Nobody in the movie has any self respect. Wonder how long anyone of these people would last in a career that was really hard, really low paid or really demeaning like oyster shucking, slaughterhouse worker, or septic system plumber. There is no counterpoint provided or any critical examination of the issues raised. Some of the conclusions reached, especially with regard to how much teachers SHOULD be paid, are the result of really wild assumptions. There's a better documentary about teaching and it's entitled ""Waiting for Superman.""",1331337600,6,717,5.033613445378151
4961878,3,B00668IEZ8,"I'm a 5th grade teacher and watched this with the hopes that the problems of education would be beautifully elaborated in this documentary. Admittedly, I wanted support for my own arguments when I encounter someone who suggests my job is easy or, at least, not as hard as most other jobs out there. To put it simply, I was a bit let down.

The film follows a few educators, some of whom still work in the field and a few who have left due to the ridiculous demands of the job. Each one comes from a slightly different walk of life, but they all share the same problem: Teaching is tough. Well, most of us knew that already. Why is it tough? The film points out that having a newborn baby and finding time to pump breast milk don't coincide with a productive teaching day. It also suggests teaching can cause divorce, as is the case with one of these teachers who works evening jobs to make ends meet and doesn't appear to have enough time for his family. Yet another realized he could make more money in real estate.

I'm a fan of testimonials when it comes to explaining the woes of my profession, however I think this film would have had a more powerful message if it focused less on the individual stories of overworked teachers and more on national statistics. That's not to say there aren't some well made arguments in this film. One particularly effective moment was when the typical amount of time a teacher works each day was broken down, hour by hour. The narration even goes so far as to point out how grading an essay can exponentially take away a teacher's free time at nights and on weekends. Kudos there. Towards the end, another valid argument came from demonstrating how the treatment and respect of U.S. teachers compares to three of the top-ranked teaching nations in the world. I just wish they had more moments like this where a side-by-side comparison could effectively help viewers see the fundamental problems with the job itself.

Unfortunately, the film mentions nothing of government-mandated standardized tests, parental involvement (or a lack thereof), or the litigious nature of our country and how that impacts schools everywhere. What I found most frustrating was the movie opens with the argument that teachers are overworked, but ends by suggesting teachers get paid more. Of course it doesn't hurt to have more take home pay (and I'll never suggest otherwise), but when the film points out how teachers have virtually no personal lives and then suggests the solution is to pay them more...haven't the filmmakers missed their own point? Instead, why not suggest the responsibilities of teachers be lightened a little so the burnout rate isn't so high? You can pay me all you want, but that doesn't mean I want to forego having any chance of life outside of my job. This is where I believe the film really missed the mark.

Obviously, I've got an emotional stake in this film being that's it meant to support the very profession I struggle with daily. For that, I'll be the first to admit my review is biased. However, I believe it's fair to say the film is still entirely watchable, but lacks the necessary emotional ""oomph"" to push the ever-needed social awareness of this topic to new levels.",1330214400,58,3227,4.696113074204947
4961879,5,B00668IEZ8,"This film was such a realistic take on the teaching profession today.  I am so tired of seeing all of these one-sided debates about what direction our school systems should go in that really only ""punish the teacher"" instead of addressing the real problems.  It was nice to see the other side from the people who know best (our teachers).  I think it will also be great for people to see that the best and brightest teachers will continue to leave the profession for a career that can provide an adequate wage and where you get treated like a professional.  Something has to change and quickly.  Very eye opening to the reality of the situation today!",1329782400,2,651,4.577586206896552

4961889,2,B00668IEZ8,"90 minutes of the same kind of discussion: money and time: Pay more for the people who devote more to their job than the usual full time person.  Nice sentiments but miss the point of where American Education has been and where it is going.  Teacher strikes and student tests to evaluate teacher effectiveness miss the point as much as the two foci of this movie.  Americans are used to picking a couple of elements and deciding the merits of a whole program on the basis of those few issues.  This movie not only does that but believes all it has to do is talk about the subject rather than show real examples of what teaching is.  How about Good and Bad teaching.  It appears that the teachers in this movie know some content but the movie misses the fact that teaching is a process that is different than just putting words on a black board (or white board).  The teachers that were shown showed little knowledge of the process of learning: tie new ideas to the ideas that the student already knows and help the student learn to differentiate more things that are the subject from those things that are not the subject to be learned.  Then they need to take those ideas and talk about them with others so they can learn how other people use the same words in different situations.  That process is ceretainly capable of being filmed but as few teachers, administrators and parents really understand it how is a film producer going to capture it?  Learning is hard work for teachers and students.  The stress of learning is only less than having a parent or child die.  It is more stressful than being in jail.  It is not IQ that students and teachers and students need but a lot of conscientiousness about the process of learning.  Show how correcting incorrect ideas and behavior is the center of learning and a film can show how teachers need to teach and need to practice to succeed.  Good luck America.  Get smart.  Learn more about learning and teaching so you can spend your money and time more wisely.",1348358400,2,2011,4.526315789473684

8493778,3,B00668IEZ8,"The documentary American Teacher gave a really good insight to the lives of teachers. It showed the different struggles that teachers have to face on a day to day basis. Some of these trials were working 65+ hour workweeks, having multiple jobs, a lack of funding for their classes, and very little pay for the time the teachers put into their classes. One of the teachers even spent about three thousand dollars of her own money when starting out because she didn't have enough funding to supply her class with the things they needed. But these teachers dealt with it, and made the best out of a bad situation. Growing up, neither students at my schools nor their parents thought that teachers work any longer than when school is in session, but this documentary really put it into perspective how much work teachers really do each week. Although I did like this documentary because it showed us something we wouldnt normally see, I think that it showed more bad than good. This is one of my only criticisms, because seeing bad thing after bad thing is really disheartening, even if it is what should be anticipated when first becoming a teacher. Overall, I would recommend this documentary just because of the simple fact that it does show some of the bad things in the profession, and isn't glorifying it by only showing the good parts. Also, because it is really eye-opening to things that one may not have expected.",1444780800,,1420,4.706827309236948

8493780,3,B00668IEZ8,"American Teacher is a documentary that sets out to say that the problems with the education system would vanish if teachers would just be paid more.  It would also keep more people in the field.  I don't think it necessarily accomplishes what it sets out to do.  What it does do well, however, is tell the story of several people as they're trying to decide whether or not to stay with their choice to be a teacher.  It shows how hard teachers work, despite people on TV claiming that they don't do much.  The documentary makes it seem like teaching is the only career path thats underpaid.  While I agree that teachers don't make as much money as they deserve, there are definitely other jobs that aren't compensated the way they should be.  American Teacher makes some valid points.  14 percent of teachers leave the profession each year, largely because they aren't paid enough to live comfortably on.  The rate at which teachers leave their jobs cost the government $7 billion dollars per year.  Statistics are shown that say teachers are paid around 14 percent less that those with jobs that require similar amounts of education.  There is a significant problem in the education system, and this documentary is good at pointing that out.  Overall I would give this documentary three out of five stars.",1427673600,,1306,4.7555555555555555
8493781,4,B00668IEZ8,"American Teacher is a documentary following the lives of teachers in America and the hardships they go through. The documentary follows the lives of four American teachers in and out of the classroom. It starts off with Jamie. She describes everything she does as a teacher, including working late, getting up early, correcting many assignments, and much more. Jamie says that she was close to quitting because she did not think she could take anymore. Erik was the next person the documentary looked at. He was hired as a history teacher and talks about the first four years of teaching being the hardest. His main goal is to connect with the kids and make class interesting and enjoyable. Jonathan and Rhena are the other two teachers and both talk about the lack of funds teachers have to work with and how a lot of stuff they need for their classroom has to come out of their already low paychecks. One of the most interesting facts mentioned in the documentary is that in the next 10 years 3 million teachers will be eligible for retirement but there may not be enough new teachers to replace them. This is due to the fact that many people are turning away from the occupation due to the fact that it does not pay as much as they are looking for. It was a good idea for the teachers to try to make their classes fun for students and get these students to like them. These teachers go through a lot of stress and work for their jobs and it is just too bad how underappreciated they are. This was a great documentary and I recommend it to anyone thinking of becoming a teacher.",1426464000,,1580,4.470588235294118
