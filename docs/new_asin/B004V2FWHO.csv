8442714,4,B004V2FWHO,"Des Pardes is undoubtedly one of the best by Dev Anand . According to Box Office this was NavKetan's last hit film . Set in London and in a small village of India , this film was much ahead of its time .
Beautifully picturised songs , innovative screenplay and direction and an excellent style of story - telling . This film is centered around illegal immigration and exploitation of innocent villagers .
I recommend this film to all Dev Anand's fans and even to those people who have a taste of sensible films .
Most of the DVDs and VCDs released lately have cut many sequences from the film ( some important too) and have twisted the story a bit . But don't get disappointed , the film on DVD and VCD is great too.
Overall - My rating is 9 out of 10 . Dev Anand was superb ; Tina Munim - Great debut ; Prem Chopra , Ajit , Amjad Khan and Bindu - Too Good ; Mehmood and Pran - Good support . Rest of the cast was reasonably well",1305763200,,929,4.054347826086956
