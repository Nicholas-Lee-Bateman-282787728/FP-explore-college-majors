I have watched this movie on other DVDs growing up, but never has it sounded so horrible. Such a disappointment. If you know anything about sound production it's like the entire thing was recorded clipping so it's very staticky and very hard to understand. I highly recommend this film, but not this DVD. Find one with better sound quality!",1478304000,,441,4.740259740259741

8035128,1,B0002Z856Y,"Picture quality poor and sound quality even worse.  Not a great film to begin with, but obviously notable for the Kern music and song performances, many of which are rare and wonderful (Judy Garland and Frank Sinatra to name two), but marred by the poor sound quality.  Very disappointing but worth seeing for me since this is apparently the only version of the film available.",1454544000,,377,4.7846153846153845
