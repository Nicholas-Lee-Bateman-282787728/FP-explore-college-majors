8680505,5,B00NVS8ZK0,"Dead is Dead 25 puts you in the town of Robertson, Michigan.  In this town and every other place around the world, the dead walk among the living.  The twist?  The dead are harmless.  A drug called doxital turned those who took it into the walking dead.  The living learned to live with the dead.  One man protects the dead.  His name is Eric Shepherd played by Mike Stanley who also wrote and directed the film.  Shepherd works for the army.  He is the head of the D.I.D. (Dead is Dead).  He realizes it's time for the dead to be put down.  Shepherd starts the extermination in his own town.  This movie is creepy and intense.  I highly recommend it.",1412726400,,651,4.325
