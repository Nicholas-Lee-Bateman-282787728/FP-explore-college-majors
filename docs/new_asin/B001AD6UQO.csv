3447053,4,B001AD6UQO,"Though this version compares favourably with 'A Study In Terror' from the same period, it does not begin to match either 'Murder By Decree' (Christopher Plummer and James Mason) or 'Jack The Ripper' (Michael Caine). But for its time it still stands up well. Viewers should keep a close eye on the unusual ending...",1292457600,2,314,4.833333333333333
3447054,4,B001AD6UQO,"It's hard to complain about the quality of this transfer because those of us who know and love this film will take it any way they can get it. This DVD release is made on demand by Sinister Cinema and doesn't look all that bad, but it's a bit faded in some areas. The foggy background doesn't help much either, but the film is as good as I remembered it to be and the ending is intact with its color sequence.

I had not seen this film since I was a kid and all I could really remember was the ending in the elevator shaft. It's a very good horror film and certainly one of the best dealing with Jack the Ripper. The DVD includes the trailer and the trailer for The Bat starring Vincent Price and the film in decent condition. It will hold you over, but I can only hope that someone will release this film completely restored and remastered.......I'm not holding my breath!",1287014400,5,873,4.259036144578313
3447055,4,B001AD6UQO,"I just watched this movie on AMC and was pleasantly surprised. The opening shot of the film had me hooked. Watching this film it was easy to see that it undeniably had to be influential in the art direction and cinematography for the ripper film ""From Hell"" (2001), and even for the opening scene in ""Time After Time"" (1979). This film presents a pretty interesting whodunit story with great acting, great suspense, and great visuals. It also finishes out the story with a pulse-pounding finale. The murder scenes and the (for it's time) blatant sexuality of the ""ladies of the evening"" garnered it an X rating in the United Kingdom. The film has fine performances, an intelligent script with good dialogue, good humor, and plenty of action. Frankly, I found it to be as relevant, compelling, and as solid as any thriller made today. I was unaware of this film until tonight. Now I'm anxious to add it to my collection on DVD. Highly recommended for fans of the genre. Cheers!",1256342400,15,976,4.713450292397661
3447056,5,B001AD6UQO,"This Jack the Ripper is very well written
& acted. I don't understand the guy who
said it'll put you to sleep? I think it's
great. The Hammer style film & scenery is
very good & the ending has an unusual twist.
They don't make movies like this where you
need to watch & listen instead of relying
on visual effects to keep your attention.
If you like old style hammer horror this
is a great movie to watch. very good.",1250553600,24,416,4.148148148148148
3447057,3,B001AD6UQO,"I like these kind of movies generally speaking, old obscure mysteries. This movie is from 1959. This one is about another Jack the Ripper typs killer in London. This was shot in glorious and gritty black and white & loads up on atmosphere. It won't be the best film ever but it is a decent effort and will appeal to those that like the Edgar Wallace Mysteries and other obscure who done its.
The DVD from Sinister Cinema isn't bad, a nice average print and contains the color sequence at the end of the movie. I think it is one of those movies to watch on a gray, foggy Saturday mornings and watch this in bed wrapped in a blanket. Worth checking out for those into these kind of movies..",1249603200,8,688,4.3

If your enterested in the real Jack The Ripper, you won't find him here. If you are a collector of bad movies, this one for you. This movie is so bad, it's almost a must to have.",1243296000,2,303,3.8253968253968256

3447061,4,B001AD6UQO,"I loved this movie and how it told the story of ""Jack the Ripper"".It was an older movie, but one I remembered from childhood. Back in the days when a thriller movie about murder did not have to have excessive amounts of blood and gore to be good.",1403049600,,246,4.145833333333333
3447062,2,B001AD6UQO,"The 2 star rating is for the disc not the film.  It is a very poor print of a fine film.  Coming from Sinister Cinema,  I knew I was taking a risk when I ordered it.  But having never seen this version of the Ripper tale, I took the chance anyway. I liked the film enough to own it, but the print leaves a lot to be desired. It's too dark in a lot of places, it's blurry in other places and all this occurs at key moments in the film. BY the way, according to recorded history, the Ripper only murdered prostitutes. In this film, two of his victims are not prostitutes. One of them is a kindly barmaid and the other is an innocent girl fleeing a bad situation. Nevertheless, this film is from Paramount, a major studio. But Sinister Cinema some how got a hold of it and has treated  it like schlock. It is not schlock. It deserves to be cleaned up, re-mastered and re-released as it was meant to be seen. The way it is now is an injustice to the film and the viewer. Buy at your own risk if you must, otherwise wait for a better treatment.",1402358400,,1039,4.073529411764706
3447063,5,B001AD6UQO,A very good black and white movie of a terror filled time in English history!  The mystery has never been solved and that leads to the wonder of this awful crime spree!!,1402358400,,169,4.28125

3447068,3,B001AD6UQO,"This film was distributed in the USA by Paramount in 1959. I saw it when it was first released and it made a big impression on me and I wanted to buy the DVD whenever it came out. This DVD is put out by Sinister, so it's a transfer on a DVD-R. The transfer is milky, full of pinholes, bad sound, BUT it's the only DVD available of this film and worth the nine bucks.",1370736000,,366,3.8933333333333335
3447069,3,B001AD6UQO,"This movie started a little slow, but I was impressed with the quality. This movie was different from other Ripper movies that he seemed to strangle the victims and there was only a vague hint that he did anything else, but it is from 1959 so things are alot more restrained then, but the voice of the ripper was enough to make your skin crawl. There are plenty of red herrings and suspects in this movie to keep you guessing who it is, and the town thugs that want to take the law into their own hands keep appearing and make life nasty, but in the end what happens to the bad guy is even nastier than I expected.

I am glad I bought the movie I am a big Jack the Ripper fan, and I am a sucker for the old black and white movies so I would say rent it, buy it give it a go.
