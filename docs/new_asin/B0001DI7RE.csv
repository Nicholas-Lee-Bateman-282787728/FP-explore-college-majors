8010926,5,B0001DI7RE,"Being able to watch Paramahansaji ""alive"" in a movie is very touching...

Wathching him moving and talking is so different from only reading his books or listening to his recordings. I highly reccomend this DVD to any truly Paramanhansanji's devotee.",1163030400,7,250,5.25
8010927,3,B0001DI7RE,"It's a nice look at Yogananda but its very short and there is not enough details on his life, the last part is a short slide show with shots of places he has been. It's nice to see but I was wanting more info and live shots of him talking.

It's better then nothing but it would be nice to see a live

tape of his talks.

I recomend it for informed followers who are just happy to get a glimpse of the Great Teacher.

He is an incrediable teacher and I suggest reading Man's Eternal Quest, and Yogananda's interpetation of the Gita.

God Bless. Hope this helped.",1152748800,15,562,4.166666666666667
8010928,5,B0001DI7RE,"For anyone whose life has been blessed by the influence of Paramhansa Yogananda, and who has wished they were alive when the great master walked the earth, this DVD is a rare treasure. Now we can see what he was like as a living, breathing man--how he walked and stood and spoke to people. How his face subtly changed as the inspiration that moved him flowed. These video clips give a much better idea of what Yogananda was like than the many still photographs that have been published. I highly recommend this collection to all disciples of Yogananda--and to all spiritual seekers--because, if the yogic teachings are true, someday in the not-so-distant future we will all manifest a similar grace.
