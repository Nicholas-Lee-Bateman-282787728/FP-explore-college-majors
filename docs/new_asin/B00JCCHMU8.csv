6354774,5,B00JCCHMU8,"In Edinburgh, Bruce Robertson is deceitful, drug-abusing, profane, sadistic, sexist, losing his mind, and an ambitious detective sergeant maneuvering for a promotion within his department.  Irvine Welsh's blistering novel Filth does not lend itself to adaptation.  Rather than focus on procedure and structure, the novelist's central interest is submerging his readership in the toxic mind of the protagonist, an amoral man in crisis.  He achieves this a number of ways, including the postmodern use of the figure of the tapeworm; a manifestation of Bruce Robertson's mental illness, it devours pages and becomes more self-aware, more philosophical, as it grows.  In a glorious twist, however, this film, masterful and psychedelic as it is, proves the novel definitely could be filmed.  It draws a significant amount of its power from an astonishing lead performance by James McAvoy.  He has given sensitive and strong performances for years, shining in such films as The Last King of Scotland, Atonement, The Last Station, and Trance.  He reaches another level here, though.  It is a bold and ferocious acting feat, at once live-wire charismatic and vastly grotesque, elevating self-destruction to an art form while slyly glancing at the audience through the camera.  As the film is told in the first person, with reality clarifying and distorting as it does for the unstable Bruce, the actor is relied upon to maintain a high level of energy and find a through-line of authentic, soulful pain amidst the colorful chaos.  His achievement is matched by ace editing, photography, and production design.  Similar to, for example, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, this is the rare serious film which invites (or even demands) aural and visual excess, and the parade of comic and/or suspenseful set pieces is nothing short of exhilarating, building to a wallop of a conclusion which slightly deviates from and, with respect to the inimitable Welsh, improves upon the novel's.",1399161600,27,1970,5.261980830670926
6354775,4,B00JCCHMU8,"The novel kicks the movie's *** and takes its lunch money.  That being said, I still thought that the movie was very, very good--if I hadn't already read the book, I would probably given the movie five stars.

When I'd first heard that FILTH was finally being made into a movie I was thrilled.  But I'd also wondered how in the world the writers were going to manage to adapt such a strange, strange novel into a screenplay.  Answer:  By cutting a LOT of Bruce's background and ""inner dialogue"" out of the story--things that explained in depth why he was so effed up.  I have to admit that I was disappointed about the writers' decision to leave out so many important elements.  On the other hand, I fear that had they managed to get everything in, the movie would have had sort of a Chuthulu-like effect on the viewers and driven everyone who had seen it mad (did I mention that FILTH is a strange, strange book?).  The writers' try to make Novel-Bruce (who is an utterly vile man) more sympathetic as Movie-Bruce--which I thought made him into a LESS sympathetic character.  While Movie-Bruce is more openly troubled and tortured man than Novel-Bruce, because no real information about his background is given, one is left wondering why one should feel any sympathy for him.  Fortunately, James McAvoy's outstanding performance, was able to make up for a lot of what was left out.

I was a little freaked out when I found out that James McAvoy had been cast as Bruce Robertson.  Don't get me wrong, I think that James McAvoy is a god among men.  But James as Bruce!?  WTF?!  I was thinking that there was no way that was going to work.  Then, I had the opportunity last year to see Mr. McAvoy in MACBETH and I saw first-hand how well he did the ""descent into madness"" thing, and my fears were alleviated.  For me, his performance as Bruce was what made the movie so good.  Even though there was so much left out of the story, Mr. McAvoy is such an amazing actor that he was able to overcome some of the issues with the script and bring Bruce to life.

My main complaint (and why I ultimately rated this as 4 stars, not 5) is that a major plot point--the murder at the beginning (and the thing that ultimately causes novel-Bruce to completely unravel) was completely changed to something that was barely warranted a mention in the movie. Why this was changed, I can't fathom, because I felt that this change really took away from the story.  The one thing that really surprised me was that I ended up liking the ending of the movie almost as much as the ending of the book (it's ultimately the same, mind you--but the circumstances are different).

All-in-all, I really did think this was an excellent movie.  Entertaining and well-acted.  If you've seen the movie, though, be sure and read the book.  And if you've read the book, be sure and give the movie a watch.  You can't really go wrong either way.",1399075200,3,2906,4.510516252390057
6354776,2,B00JCCHMU8,"Like most these things, the book was a lot better and the movie was a really bad condensed version of the original story. Book fans: a lot of stuff--a lot of real good stuff--gets lobbed off for the film version. Film fans: the movie drops a lot of allusions to certain events and characters in the book and how everything would make sense to you if you have not read the book is something I'm curious to know.

James McAvoy was a great choice for the lead and perhaps the biggest joy in the following film--especially when the story stops trying to be funny and asks of him to be the dark and troubled person he is in the book.

Maybe it did not workout for me because I read the book--a somewhat chunky read--and did not approve of the large and obvious changes the director made that ultimately made the film version something largely different from the book.

The author of Filth and the huge fan base of the book argued for years that the book could not possibly get a film adaptation, its a strange thing to see the following then but not so strange to have wanted the whole production to be kept under wraps for a while longer after having seen the movie from beginning to end.

I feel like this is the way Harry Potter book fans felt after all those movies...

In the movie's defense though: Filth was a great book and something no doubt difficult to recreate on film.",1398556800,3,1376,4.359375

However we soon discover that Bruce is out of control and works to destroy his fellow detectives in order to ensure he gets the promotion.

6354803,5,B00JCCHMU8,"I watched this movie almost immediately after reading the novel it is based on. I found Irvine Welsh's novel to be compelling, extremely entertaining, emotionally harrowing, and shockingly... well, good! I bravely started the movie believing that I was prepared for anything it could throw at me. Boy, was I wrong.

Like any film adaption of a novel, the movie version of Filth is different from the book, but it stays incredibly similar at the same time. Some scenes and characters have been taken away or changed, (some of the deleted scenes can be found in the special features) but it does nothing to make the movie any less good. Bruce Robertson's below the belt eczema and tapeworm are gone (or, in the case of the tapeworm, mostly gone), but his character- his brilliant, sordid, misanthropic, tortured character- is at his best and worst in James McAvoy's performance. McAvoy plays Bruce perfectly with each sneer, chuckle, sob, and dark look to the camera. He is the perfect Bruce Robertson in the best movie adaptation of a novel I've ever seen. And the other characters- Lennox (Jamie Bell), Blades (Eddie Marsan), Drummond (Imogen Poots)- perform wonderfully as well. This film has obviously been made by somebody (Jon S. Baird) who knows and loves the novel, and Irvine Welsh himself has voiced his approval of it. Fans of the book will not be disappointed.

Now, for people who have not read the book and want to watch the movie- you will have a good time too. There are a few parts of the movie that are less effective if you have not read it, but it holds its own really well. I recommend this movie for anybody who doesn't mind a little dirty humor and a lot of incredibly painful feelings. Just sit back and let the fun, filthy ride begin.",1455494400,,1757,4.68284789644013

6354806,4,B00JCCHMU8,"Filth  Logic Pictures  2013  Rated R  DVD version

This film seems to have been made in Scotland and on a fairly small budget.  The main character, Detective Sergeant Bruce Robinson, is played by James McAvoy.  Hes a self-centered, manipulative wastrel who is assigned to a murder investigation but is much more invested in sabotaging any of his fellow officers who are also applying for a promotion to Deputy Investigator, a promotion he wants.

So when you know at the outset the hero is a rather disgusting character, you have to figure theres only a few ways this can go.  The story manages to make you admire something about him in spite of his flaws (the bigger the flaws, the more impressive the accomplishment if this succeeds).  Or perhaps he undergoes some kind of major transformation and turns his life around?  Or perhaps he remains basically a villain all the way through (in which case, usually the story is obliged to kill him off at the end).

I won't ruin the plot by detailing which course this film takes.  Before dwelling any further on plot Ill throw in a few other observations.  The accents were kept quite mild and I didn't have trouble understanding dialog, except for a few Scottish slang terms that it really wasn't necessary to understand to follow the story.  Music was..uhsnappy?  Setting a light-hearted background tone.  Cinematography was good.  The script is based on a full length novel.  Partway through the film I was surprised to run into Joanne Froggatt, looking very much the same, and playing much the same personality as she does in Downton Abbey.

So as the story unfolds we gradually learn more about Bruces past and what has made him such a twisted f***.  The story depicts sordid situations with an unremittingly semi-comedic tone.  Without a great performance by the lead actor this movie wouldnt have worked.  James McAvoy gives a great performance.  It's a quirkily good film and, for me, definitely better than average.

6354821,4,B00JCCHMU8,"This review is aimed mostly at people who have read the book, which I had read just before watching it.  I was curious about how they would handle a book like that as a movie.  While it's not as good as Trainspotting, I have to say they did a pretty good job of capturing the guilty pleasure that is Irvine Welsh.

The movie stays pretty true to the book, and James McAvoy does a great job as Welsh's misanthropic, misogynistic, and self destructive anti-hero, Bruce Robertson.  Robertson, or ""Robbo"" is an Edinburgh plain clothes detective who's engaged in a series of ""games"" to sabotage his rivals for an upcoming promotion.  Other times, he engages in games against other people simply for his own cruel entertainment.  As usual in Irvine Welsh novels, we find ourselves rooting for him in spite of the fact that he's and objectively terrible human beings.

Of course, if you know the book, you know that there are reasons he is the way he is.  The movie pares them down a bit, and ultimately makes him a bit more tortured and sympathetic that the Robertson in the book.  This dilutes the punch a little bit, but then you also don't need a shower quite as badly as after reading the book.

Irvine Welsh is definitely not for everyone, but you know who you are, and if you liked Trainspotting, chances are you'll like this.",1431820800,,1326,4.556962025316456

6354836,4,B00JCCHMU8,"While it can't compete with ""Trainspotting"" for the best adaptation of an Irvine Welsh novel (and loses some points for feeling stylistically imitative of Boyle amazing film at times), it's still an enjoyable super-high energy romp through the muck of one cop's sick and twisted mind.

That messed up cop is played with verve and abandon by James McAvoy.  McAvoy is joining actors of his generation like Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling who have the uncanny ability to disappear into wildly different characters seamlessly, and without a lot of `look at this character I created' theatrics.

The supporting cast is this blacker than black comedy of no manners is also terrific, with Eddie Marsan as McAvoy's hapless and meek one real friend standing out in a cast full of stand outs.

Jon Baird directs with so much manic energy the film keeps threatening to derail (and not every scene works, some hitting the metaphors and symbols way too on the nose). But Baird just manages to keep it together enough so that the wretched excess in this story of a detective who will stomp on everyone around himself in hopes of getting a promotion works as a sort of Brecht on acid character study, and not a student film gone wrong (though it gets close at moments).

Not the sort of film to see if you're feeling cranky and critical, but if you want to watch a young(ish) director and some excellent actors push the limits as they look inside the heart of darkness until you don't know whether to laugh or turn away, you could do a lot worse than ""Filth"".",1416960000,,1544,4.661764705882353
6354837,3,B00JCCHMU8,"As an adaptation of the novel Filth this movie really fails.  The talking tapeworm and the tragic backstory of the girl in the wheelchair were part of what made the novel so unique.

But to be fair I did think that James McAvoy and the supporting cast all did an excellent job with what they had to work with, McAvoy especially had an uphill battle against the asinine script and direction and he managed to pull off an amazing performance anyway, even bringing me to tears at one point.

Although Bunty was fat and ugly in the novel I did enjoy Shirley. Henderson's sexy portrayal of the character.

I wish James McAvoy could have starred in a proper adaptation of the novel because that could have been brilliant.  The fact that I still enjoyed this movie and can't give it one stars is all due to his acting.

6354840,3,B00JCCHMU8,"FILTH is one of those films that will divide viewers in terms of response.  Set in contemporary Edinburgh, it concerns the efforts of cop Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy) to secure promotion by fair means or foul.  This plot-line merely provides the springboard for a penetrating examination into his corrupt state of mind.  The word ""filth"" as used in this film is ambiguous; it not only refers to the police force as a whole (""filth"" being a British colloquialism) but also describes the state of Robertson's mind.

As portrayed by director John S. Baird, Robertson cannot separate the corruption of his mind from the corruption in the outside world.  He is caught within his own web of deceit; a world where infidelity is standard practice, where taking drugs is rife, where so-called ""criminals"" get routinely beaten up, and where he is routinely suspicious of his fellow-competitors for the promotion.  There are some memorable sequences to suggest his inner turmoil: one involving a tapeworm suggests that, like Hamlet, corruption is gradually seeping into his soul.  On several occasions we see pig-images; again, director Baird plays on the ambiguity of the term, with ""pig"" being another euphemism for the police as well as an animal that digs around with its snout in the swill of life.

FILTH contains a suggestive intertext - on at least three occasions it references FRANK, the television show starring ""Frank Sidebottom"" that spawned a movie of its own FRANK (2014).  The allusion is significant, as it reminds us of the thin dividing-line between madness and sanity that pervades Robertson's mind: what he perceives as ""sane"" behavior in his terms might be considered ""mad"" elsewhere.  In fact, this same distinction could be applied to the world he inhabits, where ""good"" characters seem to be routinely abused and ""bad"" characters reign supreme.  Bladesey (Eddie Marsan) leads a blameless life, but he is routinely cuckolded by his wife (Shirley Henderson) and treated with disdain by Robertson.

In the end, however, Robertson fails to secure promotion and ends up a forlorn figure, rejected by his wife (Shauna Macdonald) and daughter (Megan Finn).  There is one significant sequence taking place in a supermarket, where he tries to talk to a woman and her son whom he has recently encountered; however they are seen to move quickly out of the right of the frame, almost as if they do not want to be seen in his company.  FILTH neither offers an optimistic nor a pessimistic end; but rather suggests that this is the norm in contemporary urban life - people live isolated, alienated lives, unable (or perhaps unwilling) to disentangle the ""good"" from the ""bad.""

The direction is brisk and suggestive, with a particularly clever use of musical excerpts.  With its consistent bad language and violence, FILTH might not be to everyone's taste, but it is a memorable film.",1414972800,,2886,5.04421052631579

6354858,1,B00JCCHMU8,"You know you're in trouble when the synopsis of a films plot talks about debauchery, sex, and drugs, and yet it opens with the cheery sounds of Winter Wonderland.

If youve ever seen the GIF of James McAvoy flipping two birds to a kid that just gave him one, promptly after releasing the kids balloon, then yes, you are already familiar with two seconds of the beginning of Filth.  However, this is a film that, like its main character, deteriorates rather quickly, so you may not be laughing as much as you may think after the first few minutes are over.

Filth has the fast-paced humor element of Trainspotting, the corruption level element of In Bruges, and the who-the-f***-am-I element of Fight Club all rolled together to make you feel, well, filth-y by the time the film concludes.

Bruce, our main character, is so deplorable that he almost makes us like McAvoy a little bit less - thats probably a testament to how well McAvoy plays him.  Hes crude, disgusting, manipulative and a complete wastrel of a human being.  Thats it.  If you're expecting me to tell you that he has a change of heart at the end that completely validates his existence, well, that just doesnt happen.

This pig enjoys such vile past-times as prank-calling his best friends wife (and then blaming it on said best friend later on) and manipulating everyone into playing an office party game in which the dudes take pictures of their penises, then the girls have to guess which penis belongs to which dude - only Bruce uses it to his advantage to pretend he has the largest penis in order to bang one of the girls in the office.  Real winner, this guy.  Oh, and hes a cop seeking a promotion - did I forget to mention that?

The one thing Bruce is happy about and proud of is his Scottish heritage, though Scotland probably doesnt return his sentiments.

If you have never seen McAvoy in a sex scene and you want to (be it with himself or someone else), then youll get everything you wished for and more here, but then you won't be so sure anymore why you wished for it.

Of course, theres the typical he went through a major loss in his life and thats why hes so screwed up plot point, but really, thats not even half of enough of an excuse to explain why Bruce acts the way he does.  His hallucinations that could be their own character, they show up so much in the film, get increasingly more strange, and when the explanation is finally offered, we understand, but we certainly don't empathize.

**SPOILERIFIC ENDING HERE**

So Fight Club enters the fold when we see that Bruce has been cross-dressing as his wife in an attempt to keep her close to him, and that he witnessed the murder at the beginning of the film while dressed like her so he couldn't report it to his department for fear of being found out.  You mean to tell me that no one ever saw him out and about, dressed like this, and recognized him?  He didn't even bother to shave his face - just threw on a wig, and haphazardly at that.

Im wondering if I read the book on which this film was based, which was written by Irvine Welsh, if I would understand and maybe even like the film, but I doubt it.  Another critic put it perfectly when he said that Filth's title essentially sums up its plot, as well as how you feel by the time its finally over.  Its like A Clockwork Orange, if you stripped it of its cult status and took everything redeeming out of it.",1412899200,3,3408,4.4208

I have read reviews by some who were disgusted with the sex and drug use, but (unlike ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") there is a point to it.  It is the story of a police inspector with gnawing personal problems, which he deals with through sexual encounters and drug use.  It is a great antihero character study which is a deeper story than the superficiality of his self-medication.  It has plot twists and unexpected endings.

I admire this film on many levels, and it made me angry, sad and enervated as it progressed. Quite humorous regarding some of the quips and comments, but I wouldn't label it a comedy.

McAvoy does quite a bit of scene chewing and although he's up to the task the plot is muddled, underdeveloped and truly secondary to the unflinching character portrait .  ""Filth"" is similar in execution to ""Bad Lieutenant"", but it does offer an occasional sardonic or humorous aside - mostly in the first half of the movie.

For the most part, ""Filth"" is a gritty exploration of law enforcement's dark side, and McAvoy's Bruce Robertson is one of the most unsympathetic law enforcement characters ever committed to celluloid.

Like the old saying goes, ""Don't judge the book by its cover"", and here I went to watch this film expecting not much from it and 'boy' I was positively surprised, not to mention----totally entertained.  This film is definitely not for everyone, and I agree with reviewers who rated the film with only 1 or 2 stars.  Filth (2013) based on the book by Irvine Welsh (you know the guy who brought you Trainspotting and The Acid House) is a film that you will either hate or love.  I don't think there is much middle ground left here for ""I like the movie"" or ""the movie is ok"".  The biggest turn-off for majority of English speaking viewers will probably be the Scottish-English slang.  I myself found the English spoken in the film atrocious.  However, understanding only about half of the dialogue did NOT turn me away from this positively sick film.  The story line, the characters, the intrigue, the atmosphere and grotesque only pulled me further into this one crazy-ride of a film.  Those who like Trainspotting (1997), Hot Fuzz (2007) or simply enjoy British dark/sarcastic humor will definitely embrace this flick.  Who knows, it might even become their new favorite film.  To the more American audience, I would compare this film to a mixture of In Bruges (2008) meets The Machinist (2004) meets Rules of Attraction (2002)---but with a heavy British dark humor and Scottish accent.  Great Britain (in this case Scotland) year after year, again and again ---demonstrates what cinema is all about-- if it was not for films produced in Great Britain, current European cinema would have nothing to show for.",1410739200,,1664,4.865248226950355

Another disclaimer, I have never read Irvine Welsh so I have no emotional investment in the books that either movie came from.

I watched this movie for one reason, James McAvoy. And, after having watched it, I'm glad I was drawn to it because of him-- it's brilliant. I never really understood the description of Trainspotting as a comedy (I mean, come on, a comedy about heroin addiction!) and after watching it, I thought it was bleak, desperate, and there was not much at all funny about it.

Filth, on the other hand, actually takes a bleak world and horrible circumstances and injects some truly funny moments. Is it a comedy in the true sense of the word? Maybe....depends on if you go with the standard definition (like Shakepeare's Much Ado About Nothing in which much tension and drama occur but ultimately there's one man shunned and a marriage occurs) or if you just define a comedy as a movie that's laugh after laugh at something stupid (take Dumb and Dumber for that example).

McAvoy is amazing and the rest of the cast is excellent as well. The Scottish accent was only an occasional problem but I was still happy to turn on the subtitles.

I don't want to spoil any of the film, but it was a movie that was so though provoking I watched it and when I woke up the next day, I had to rewatch it.

6354977,3,B00JCCHMU8,"There are several reasons for considering watching this film about a possible hero's descent into madness and despair - a book and screenplay by Irving Welsh (`Trainspotting'), and Jon S. Baird who seems to be rising as a writing an directing and producing talent to watch, and the brilliant actor James McAvoy who continues to impress with a wide range of roles. What doesn't work so well is the 97 minutes of unmitigated coarse material and activity and the ruthlessness of the abuse of the individual that is performed by a primarily Scottish cast with brogues so thick that without subtitles about 90% of the film is inaccessible (not that that is a bad thing in the end...)

The promo for the film describes the `story' best: `Scheming Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy), a bigoted and corrupt policeman, is in line for a promotion and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Enlisted to solve a brutal murder and threatened by the aspirations of his colleagues, including Ray Lennox (Jamie Bell), Drummond (Imogen Poots), Bladesey (Eddie Marsan), Inglis (Emun Elliott) etc, Bruce sets about ensuring their ruin, right under the nose of unwitting Chief Inspector Toal (John Sessions). As he turns his colleagues against one another by stealing their wives (Shirley Henderson unrecognizable gussied up in wigs, Kate Dickie, Joanne Froggart) and exposing their secrets, Bruce starts to lose himself in a web of deceit that he can no longer control. His past is slowly catching up with him, and a missing wife Carole (Shauna Macdonald), a crippling drug habit and suspicious colleagues start to take their toll on his sanity. The question is: can he keep his grip on reality long enough to disentangle himself from the filth?

Despite a brilliant acting turn from James McAvoy, a film that celebrates murder, phone sex, police corruption, casual frequent fellatio, crude (when understood) language, etc will have a very limited and likely not a long lasting appeal. Grady Harp, May 14",1401494400,3,1985,4.993957703927492

6354980,4,B00JCCHMU8,"Despite some inconsistent tone, FILTH is a darkly comic film about a despicable cop's descent into madness. The story follows Bruce Robertson, a Scottish cop who is up for a promotion, and in charge of a murder investigation. However, those two details are merely springboards for what the movie is really about, that is, his impossibly filthy lifestyle and how he pushes himself to his breaking point. As played by James McAvoy, he is largely unsympathetic although he does have a twisted sense of humor. Other than possibly feeling sorry for him (which is a stretch), the only thing audiences will have to connect with is the promise of being reunited with family, which is what he hopes to achieve with the promotion. However, in the end, even that proves illusory. There is a seriously dark undercurrent to this whole movie, but there is a lot of dark humor to soften what otherwise would be an oppressively dark portrait of a man on the edge. Even still, these are the kind of movies that I love. It's not perfect, due to some jarring attempts at sentimentality, but this is largely a bravura effort with an incredible performance by James McAvoy, and based on a book by the author of TRAINSPOTTING (which tackles similar thematic material). Despite not being for everybody, this is a well-made film that is captivating and deserves to be seen by anybody willing to give it a chance.",1401062400,13,1388,4.763485477178423

On it's own it was a good film. Visually interesting with good acting. Kind of a dark comedy but not all about humor also a character study.

6355007,4,B00JCCHMU8,"Ive been waiting for James McAvoy to make good on his promising start since 2006, but sadly I have yet to see him get the accolades and projects worthy of his talent.  The thing is, I don't think many people really know who he is.  Despite having been in that Narnia series and despite having headlined some popular films (like X-Men), the majority of the world is unfamiliar with his name.  This is sad, because McAvoy displayed such thick character development in The Last King of Scotland, and while Whitaker had the flashiest character, it was McAvoy who deserved the accolades that Whitaker received.

Filth is not going to change McAvoys popularity, mostly because half of the known world will not see it, but it is further proof of the fact that McAvoy deserves a better career.

Why is someone like Ryan Reynolds a household name but James McAvoy is known as that guy who plays Charles Xavier?

James McAvoy is indeed on FIRE as Bruce Robertson, the coke snorting, philandering, prank calling, devious cop hoping for a promotion we all know he doesnt deserve.  Hell do anything to get it though, even if it means destroying the reputations of his fellow colleagues.  Whether hes challenging his so-called friends to a measuring contest, blackmailing minors into giving him favors or prank calling a friends wife, Bruce is also self-purposing and always self-damaging.  The thing is, there is a darker backstory that is causing all this outlandish behavior, and soon Bruce is going to crack under the pressure.

The main issues with Filth lie in the films construction.  It is just tonally off.  The film is in one part a black comedy and in the other a dire drama, and the two ends don't meet comfortably.  Irvine Welsh is not an easy writer.  His style is one that is exploitive and harsh and yet carries a humor that is needed to cut all the tension.  Danny Boyle knew how to blend those worlds harmoniously, giving us a pretty stellar film in Trainspotting, back in 1996.  Sadly, Filth doesnt balance those two ends fluidly.  Instead, it tries to give us two separate films.  The first half is rather brilliant.  The dark comedy angle serves a strong purpose and gives McAvoy and the rest of the cast something to sink their teeth into.  The second half (or final act, more specifically) delves so far away from the comedy and into a more severe tone that it feels off and takes us out of the film.  It almost feels too serious, to the point where it becomes unintentionally funny, which isn't what you want from a film like this.

That being said, McAvoy is brilliant and it is a shame that this won't garner him any awards traction at the end of the year.  The film is simply too small and too harsh for anyone to single it out.  The rest of the cast, especially Jamie Bell, is also up to the task and handles the material well, but this is the McAvoy show from start to finish.",1399593600,3,2891,4.57976653696498
