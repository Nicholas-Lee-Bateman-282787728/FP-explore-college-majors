If you wish to make/influence your child to speak more Chinese Mandarin, this is a good too.",1398816000,,173,4.2727272727272725
7900294,4,7883703439,"I like this dvd set.  I am Chinese, and would like my son to learn Chinese.  He loves mickey mouse clubhouse.

This one is pretty loyal to the original story with even translated songs to match.  Other than small mistakes here and there, I really like it.  My son loves to mimic the voices in the DVD in Chinese.  Sometimes, I would be cooking and left him watching this dvd set, and would listen to him repeating the colors and numbers and objects in Chinese. :-)

Does need a multi region dvd player to work.

The only problem is the donald duck's voice.  I don't know if anyone can figure out what he is talking about.",1312243200,2,621,4.2844827586206895
