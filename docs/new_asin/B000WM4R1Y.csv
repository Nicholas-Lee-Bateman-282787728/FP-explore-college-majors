8223642,5,B000WM4R1Y,"Dark Mind is a psychological thriller on par with Pi.  I loved this movie and for $2.50 you can't go wrong!
A blast to watch, set during the cold war so there was plenty of paranoia, tells the story of an inventor who is afraid of everyone stealing everything from him.

Definitely recommend.",1378080000,,292,4.490566037735849
8223643,4,B000WM4R1Y,"The reason I bought this DVD, is because Lyndsy Fonseca is in it. But overall, the movie is enjoyable because it has a mystery or suspense quality to it, the sets are dark, it seems its always nighttime. The main character is a nerd and he is weird, which I guess suits the purpose for the movie, otherwise I wouldn't like the character since he actually charms Lyndsy's character.",1354060800,,381,4.536231884057971
8223644,1,B000WM4R1Y,This is one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. Christopher Kennedy Masterson is completely horrible in his portrayal as the lead role and the writer/director should rethink their career options. Don't waste your time!,1326931200,,223,5.222222222222222
8223645,4,B000WM4R1Y,"This is an effective, well-made and very atmospheric film. If you liked Alex Proyas' DARK CITY, The THIRTEENTH FLOOR, David Lynch's work, the writings of Kafka, or even Alfred Hitchcock's films, then you will derive more enjoyment/understanding than that of the ""general/mainstream public"".

The acting is quite good (Lyndsy Fonseca shines in a relatively short role) and the overall standard of film-making is particularly effective and demonstrative of skill.

Despite what the other reviews have stated, I thought it wasn't as ""abstract"" as I was expecting. Yes, it does allow for the audience to ""fill in the gaps"" and come to one's own conclusion/s on certain matters and meanings (particularly at the end), but I like that. It does, after all, deal with paranoia and suspicion and even perspective, so I really don't know what some people expect out of a film like this? What? Everything to be wrapped up in a nice, perfect bow at the end? If that IS what you want, then I suggest you stick with a Jerry Bruckheimer movie (no offense, great entertainment, but not all that intellectually challenging).

Oh, and I thought the musical score was particularly good.

I hope this review helps.",1286582400,6,1194,4.984924623115578
8223646,4,B000WM4R1Y,"It is quite misleading to think of this as a dramatic film centering on a plot. It is an artsy film and the plot would be quite secondary for most viewers. Personally this was not my cup of tea, but there were many very good things about it and I hope it matches up with its intended audience.

What I did like was the photography, especially the ways the camera work came together with the lighting to give a surreal effect. The protagonist was a nut case and the photography fit well with his paranoia and with the odd happenings. I won't give away some mild surprises here. I suspect that stoners might find them stronger than mild.

I did not care for the acting and dialogue. But again that is a matter of personal taste. There are art film types that seem to find these styles effective -- somewhere off the edge of realism, but not really over the top most of the time. Maybe I would like them better on a second viewing, some films are like that. I would watch it again if only for the images. On the extra features there is ""early animatic"" and I like some cartoon art and thought that this was especially good as my tastes sometimes go.

In a way, forget the plot. As I said it is an artsy film and one can read a lot into the plot and dialogue, and maybe imagine things that are not there. If you like to do that, go for it. But the superficial plot of a paranoid inventor was not at all interesting to me.

Let me take a stab at a ""deeper"" meaning. There are constant references to McCarthyism. The film is set in that era and starts with a quote from the notorious Senator. Then there are constant messages on radios about the communist threat that wants to take away our liberty and our property. The radio is as paranoid as the inventor. The whole atmosphere is paranoid and suspicious and self-destructive. This is in your face and obviously intended. We are still only one layer down, though from the superficial.

Toward the end (sorry if this is a sort of plot spoiler, but I don't think the intended audience will be put off)the inventor has a sort of conversation with himself. What more or less comes out is that he has been driven mad because he has not lived up to his childhood promise of being a prodigy. He has gone into denial and the disappointment and denial and fear have driven him into crazy delusions and violence.

Against this consider the standard sociological explanations for the hysteria of the McCarthy era. The US came out of WWII as the hope of the world. Then Russia stole the bomb and the commies took over China. America got bogged down in Korea. Americans were frightened. Americans then were worried that we were not as great as we had been telling ourselves. We went into denial and tried to blame all our problems on commie, liberal, pinko, queers, etc.and set out to get them.

Well, to go with that for the sake of discussion the boy genius is the young nation saving Europe and being the hope of the world. His disappointments with his own life are the historical disappointments in the US. His neurosis is the neurosis of McCarthyism.

Maybe, maybe not. Again, personally I enjoyed it only for the talent behind the visuals and music and did not feel knocked over the head by the plot or message, and in fact it did not really matter. I am sure that others will look at it differently.",1236038400,,3339,4.40032414910859
8223647,1,B000WM4R1Y,"Deserves 0 stars.  You continue to wait for something to happen, but nothing does.  This flick hits with a dull thud.  Maybe people with a dark sense of humor ""get it,"" but I don't.  This movie proves that an interesting blurb on a DVD box will get people to watch anything.",1202256000,3,274,4.313725490196078
