8297149,4,B001E904YI,"In the alternate universe, in which Rocky Jones lives, the inner Solar System is crowded with planets; this is not a harmonious system of planets.

The most belligerent planet is Ophiuchus.  It is not powerful enough to declare war, so it resorts to trickery, deceit and covert attacks.  The Ophiuchus Formation is ruled by suzerain Cleolotta.

Planet Medina is ruled by Agar, but his sister, Yara, has considerable influence.  Unfortunately, Agar is rawly sensitive about his stature and compensates this with his grandiose desire to be the supreme ruler of the universe at any cost.

The outlaw planets are not as warlike as Ophiuchus or Medina.  They are willing to negotiate peace with the other planets.

Jupiter's moon, Fornax, was thought to be uninhabited and not worth investigating by the other planets.  They were wrong; it is inhabited and it has an extremely valuable energy resource.

United Planets.  Earth is where Rocky Jones receives his orders from Secretary Drake of Space Affairs.  Rocky and his crew Winky, Vena Ray, and Bobby fly the Orbit Jet, which is a needle-nosed rocket with tail fins and stubby wings.

These series appear to be out of order; suggest the following order:
1.  'Beyond the Curtain of Space' - Rescue mission to Ophiuchus.
2.  'Bobby's Comet' - Discovery mission to Fornax to learn about new power source.
3.  'Silver Needle in the Sky' - Mission to ferry ambassadors to a peace conference.
4.  'Forbidden Moon' - Rescue mission to space station RV-5.

Science: mostly double-talk.  Note: The spelling for a few names and places are guesses.

Picture: fair to good.  No cropping.  Sound: good.  Volume: normal.

These are adversarial missions; to see very short, but peaceful missions, check out:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Corbett-Space-Cadet/dp/B0028ZI8E0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Corbett, Space Cadet</a>",1258675200,5,1909,5.481099656357388
