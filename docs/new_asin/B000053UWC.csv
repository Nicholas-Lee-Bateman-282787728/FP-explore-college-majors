1390110,4,B000053UWC,"Honestly, I like this movie.  I agree with the other reviewer who felt that the scenes with the children dancing detracted from the plot.  However, if you ignore the kids you get a movie with a creepy atmosphere, some good scares, and morality.  Plus, you get killer bugs that may or may not be the incarnation of the souls of the people who have been buried in a Potter's field.
What's not to like?",1087776000,,399,4.364864864864865
1390111,4,B000053UWC,"Okay, I agree that the overused shots of the jump roping got old real fast, and it never really did explain itself, other than haunting the missing persons detective.  But I credit director Tim Southam on his use of atmosphere and the rarity of not really showing the flies.  Just the jerky camera work and the sound of the flies gave a pervasive feel.  Some haunting, if unnecessary imagery.  And the big question too remains:  if the flies only wanted Malcolm MacDowell's character, why did they kill off everyone else?
McDowell does well in his role; Talissa Soto plays the cop who was an orphan, adopted by Irish parents, which explains her Italian accent; Bruce Ramsay did a good job as Tony, the wrongly convicted felon; and surprisingly Keith McQuaid as the jittery inmate and rapper Mos Def as a typical jive man were quite good and entertaining.  A big complaint though:  what was it with the slow mo introduction to the mayor accompanied by that awful noise we call rap, performed no less by Mr. Def?  It obviously was inserted to attract teens I'm sure, but artistically it was brutally inappropriate.  I give it the four stars for the intense brooding atmosphere, and the old chestnut that says there is more terror in implied horror than in gross out.
Not a gem, but a different and recommended thriller.",1072742400,,1317,4.716157205240175
1390112,3,B000053UWC,"Island of the Dead is one of those bad movies that I still find something to like about because I just find the concept so interesting/promising.  Multi-millionaire developer Rupert King (Malcolm McDowell) has engineered a new low income housing community for the homeless of New York City to be built on Hart Island.  Hart Island (a real place) is the Potter's Field of New York, where the homeless and lost are buried in mass graves.  What no one realizes is that King has darker motives (linked to his ties with medical research) in store for the future residents of Hope City.  Meanwhile a Missing Persons detective (Talisa Soto in a wasted role) is tracking down the last victim of 'The Double Dutch Killings' in hopes of laying to rest the haunting image of the dead girls skipping rope.  This is a hope that most of the audience will share, as we see the trio skipping rope and chanting a morbid little ditty over and over and over and over again.  Sadly screenwriters Tim Southam (who also directed) and Peter Koper (who came up with the promising idea) fail to develop these two storylines or the characters and their subplots in any great detail.  This forces director Southam to pad the movie with far too many 'atmospheric' music montages and gives co-star Talisa Soto nothing to do but look sullen and haunted (this after giving her character an intriguing introduction, pity).  Sadly the 'vengeful fury of the dead' is unleashed via a hord of illness inducing insects (as opposed to simple zombies) with little information given to the viewer as to why it is happening.  One or two ghostly spectres or whispering voices would have helped, so you can add the trio of little girls to the list of missed opportunities.  What this movie badly needed was a major reworking of its core story elements, especially in regards to the supernatural aspects in the second and third acts, then, perhaps, it might have been better.  If you really want to depress yourself, just think what Terence Fisher, Jimmy Sangster (or John Elder), Peter Cushing, and Christopher Lee could have done with this material back in the glory days of Hammer Studios.  So it goes.",1068163200,4,2161,4.7640750670241285
1390113,3,B000053UWC,"This movie forces one to pose that age-old question: why do terrific actors like Malcolm McDowell make these kinds of sub par movies?  The basic premise has potential: take an island harboring what is left of the remains of almost a million of society's castaways, bring in a ruthless businessman determined to remake the island into a ""Hope City"" for the poor and homeless (while secretly pursuing his own less magnanimous plans for the future population), have the dead somehow put their ethereal foot down in opposition, and wait for all the fun to happen.  Alas, these dead souls are a rather lazy, unimaginative lot choosing to manifest themselves as worms and bugs-sure, the bugs are really, really annoyed and aggressive, but they're still just bugs.  I would hope that any future manifestations of my own future dead self will be much more noteworthy.  It's cool to see dead bodies bloated and bursting with creepy crawlies mere hours after death, but this is the sort of thing one tends to view as a precursor of more ambitious tragedies to come, not as a be all and end all in itself.  In case you think all the worm stuff sounds incredibly gross, it really isn't.  While there are plenty of maggots bursting forth from chests and stomachs, there is not even one good mouth-exiting maggot shot to satisfy horror fans like myself who sort of expect that type of thing from a movie like this.
The fact that I didn't like two of the most important characters also didn't help my enjoyment of this movie.  You have a tough lady cop who investigates missing children, but she has sort of an attitude, and the whole missing children theme seemed nothing more than a ruse for explaining why she was out on Hart Island in the first place (and the images of three presumably formerly missing girls jumping rope every ten minutes became utterly annoying).  Then there is the convict working funeral duty who complains about being arrested and beaten up unjustly; one uncharacteristic bit of aggressive dialogue from him soured me on his good graces.  There is one great character that provides a lot of much-needed humor during the first half of the film, for which I thank him.  Finally, we have Malcolm McDowell, who does deliver a typically fine performance in a role he could not have been enthused over; of course, playing a twisted, uncaring millionaire isn't the kind of role one has to master Stanislavsky's techniques in order to pull off.  When all is said and done, this movie fails to deliver the types of creeps and thrills its title obviously brings to mind, and the characters are too shallow to merit much attention.  It's not bad or unwatchable, but there is just nothing about it that demands your attention or gory indulgence.",1043280000,6,2745,4.75578947368421
1390114,1,B000053UWC,"I'm a big fan of horror movies, and I watched a lot of them, but this one doesn't have anything interesting for the horror genre...I do not recommend this movie...If you want horror, look for ""The Ring""...",1031097600,,205,4.5675675675675675

What I got was a spanish cop, Rupert, flies, and dead people in the ground.  Also I think the little dancing children were evil and usless to the story.  The only thing that could help this movie is it having Evil deafd in the middle of the movie",1001980800,,368,4.242857142857143
1390117,1,B000053UWC,"Given that most view this movie as a Blockbuster Rental, let me start with saying that if you love a ""Horror"" movie with constant jump rope flashback sequences this is the movie for you.  I was under the impression that the movie had something to do with Zombies.  I was sorely mistaken.  It had a good setup; Island loaded with the unknown dead, Rich guy wants to develop island into city.  The island is said to have old houses lived in years ago by the diseased.  An asylum is also talked about.  So as I wait for my zombies to start snacking, I wait...and wait...only to find that the only ""horror"" are...flies.  Flies that carry some unexplained disease that kills within minutes.  The flies continue on killing until they bite the rich ""Trump"" like fellow (MCDowell)and then leave.  Even if I knew from the start that this was not a Zombie flick, I would still have hated this movie.  It would win the award for ""Most number of times a jump rope flashback sequence was shown"".  I give the movie 1 Star because I cannot go any lower with the rating.  Of course maybe I'm being biased as I can't fully judge a movie when I fast forward through half of it...Ending on a positive note though, you could use the movie as a new drinking game; you know, every time the jump rope scene comes on, you drink.  Every time the rich New Yorker says ""Mate"", etc...Stay away from the Island of the Dead.  Your better off at Fantasy Island.  Right Malcolm?",999907200,2,1446,4.444866920152092
7930070,5,B000053UWC,"I have seen this movie on TV before, and had to have a copy. It isn't as well known as other horror films, but is very good in its own rights. It is a story about a rich guy who buys an island off the coast of New York where ""unknowns"" have been buried for years. What has happened, though, is that killer flies have been breeding underground among the shallow graves. To me it is a a very well done film and worth watching.",1432339200,,424,4.0

7930072,4,B000053UWC,Quite an interesting and scary movie - but hated all the rap music background - it took away from the experience. I think I understand why they used it - but it seemed like a cop-out for not having a better musical score.,1373760000,,221,4.162790697674419
7930073,4,B000053UWC,"Malcolm McDowell has long been a favorite actor of mine for his charasmatic performances in numerous pictures of every genre, and it was his name that enticed me to get this atmospheric horror film.  McDowell plays a charming and ruthless real estate magnate with an eye on developing a housing/business complex on an island currently serving as a potter's field for New York's unclaimed departed.  There's a dark side to the millionaire's plans, and the island doesn't take on the idea of change well.  Soon there are supernatural happenings plaguing those assembled on the island.
The film reminds me of the old black & white Val Lewton movies which stressed character and mood over action - thereby saving somewhat on expense.  The menace is simply supernatural and not as well defined as I would have liked, but over all it works within the chilling story set on the island.  The characters are somewhat engaging and manage to rise at least one level over the stock characters of most horror films I've seen of late.  McDowell is the best thing about the film, crafting a character who despite an evil motivation remains both human and fun to watch.",1347926400,,1153,4.8274111675126905
7930074,1,B000053UWC,"The movie is about a hive mind swarm of flies, with some sort of uber-toxin that decomposes your body in minutes.  There are no zombies, even though the title of the the movie is ""island of the dead"" and it takes place on an island full of many unidentified bodies.  There's not even any witty dialog, which is the only saving grace of some otherwise unbearable horror movies.

There is also a flashback of some girls jumping rope, which has absolutely nothing to do with anything in the movie, and it is shown 3 or 4 times.  It's there to make the director feel like he's artsy.

Please save 90 minutes of your life, and pass on this.",1295568000,,635,4.3474576271186445
7930075,3,B000053UWC,"ISLAND OF THE DEAD appears to be a made-for-cable or TV movie, shot in Canada.  You can tell because the screen fades to black every 15 minutes or so for the commercial break.

This is a very low budget affair, making for a very low-key horror film.  It's supposedly set on New York City's Hart's Island (where the city runs a potter's field for burying the impoverished or unidentified dead), but NYC can't be seen over the horizon as the ferry crosses the water.  Just an insert shot of Manhattan at film's start to set the location.

Then there's the shot where Talisa Soto (who plays a cop) walks down Manhattan, glass skyscrapers behind her.  She looks across at a ghetto-like street with boarded-up buildings.  Obviously not shot on the same location.  Editing those two shots together was truly unconvincing.

Story concerns evil rich man Malcolm McDowell (playing a casino owner/developer named ""The Rupert"" -- as in, ""The Donald"" Trump), who is building a low-income community on the island -- with sinister motives.  He arrives on Hart's Island with an entourage and these evil flies attack.  But they do so after most of the entourage has left, so there are very few actors on this island to attack.  Just The Rupert and a handful of cops and prisoners burying the dead on potter's field.

Here's some sloppy story-telling: seems the flies only want to kill The Rupert, because when he dies, they stop.  Talisa Soto marvels that the flies were after him.  But then ... why did the flies kill several other people earlier in the film, and ignore The Rupert?

Anyway, the flies' bite is deadly, causing you to puff up in a disgusting manner before you die.  Not a real gory film, but there is some creepy atmosphere.  It actually helps that the low budget only allowed for a few actors.  The location is nice -- a deserted island with abandoned buildings and grave markers.  And the gray Canadian sky helps -- very much like in THE X-FILES.  It's obviously not New York, but it makes for a decent horror film.  Not great, but decent.

I disagree with the reviewer who said Talisa Soto looks old.  She looks quite young, still.  However, she looks awfully thin.  Her face is so tight and thin, it's almost skull-like.  I'd heard a story from a film industry friend that on the set of VAMPIRILLA, Soto was so thin, they had trouble keeping her costume from slipping off.

Somebody get this girl a milkshake and fries, fast!

The DVD is remarkably crappy, in that there is NO MENU.  No special features, not even a scene selection.  You pop in the DVD and go straight to the movie.  Really, how hard is it to create a menu, with maybe some cast notes and scene selection?

Without even a menu, this DVD should be selling at the bargin bin price of $1.99 -- $3.99 max.

The DVD is full screen, but as this is likely a TV movie, that's likely the original screen format.",1135987200,,2874,4.570588235294117
7930076,4,B000053UWC,"it's hard to find movies like this anymore. 2001 release. It will be too hard for kids to understand and some wives might get bored because there's not a lot of action in the onset. No offense. It tells a story. The story is of an English billionaire who was trying to turn Hart's Island , which I've seen by the way, into a state backed housing and work unit for the un-adjusted in society, the same way that they used to bury them there , the no names, unidenifiable, etc.. there is no gore in this movie.. just maggots and insects. They wreak vengeance upon those that would intrude upon their resting place. I thought the cast was stellar but the production could have been better. Malcolm McDowell is a great actor that is spurned by modern Hollywood. Every single person was believable in the role, but I have to give it 4 stars because the message and the poignancy of it were a bit lost, and left for the viewer to understand, a bit more summary would have been apt. I blame the director for that .. the message is still there ( do not tread upon the dead ) but it could have been more forecefully done. Again, the cast was totally believable and congrats to those who starred here.",1133568000,2,1190,4.3408071748878925
7930077,1,B000053UWC,"I just finished watching this movie about 12 minutes ago and I am still disappointed. The description of this movie is misleading, there are no zombies, no ravenous anythings, just stupidity laced with boredom. I waited for almost an hour for something to happen in this movie, and still nothing.

It starts out as if it is going to be a good movie but it's a lie. Im sure you've read the previous reviews you know the plot, or lack there of. There was one interesting part of the entire movie, and that was when the comic relief died. Now this means two things. For one, it took place in the middle of the movie so that meant the other half is a waste. Second, now there is no entertainment what so ever as far as dialog goes.

7930079,1,B000053UWC,"Watched this tripe last night. I heard supposed good things about it when they were making it. BAD BAD BAD movie! Children of the Dead level of bad.
First off, Talisa Soto is one fine looking specimen, but she's aged to a point where she can't pull off either Lara Croft or Vampirella, both of which were modeling gigs she had when she was younger. She even played Vampirella in the horrible movie version with Roger Daltrey as the heavy.
I don't know what they thought they were doing when they made this movie. The locale, Harts Island, is sufficiently creepy. A million bodies, mostly of the indigent have been buried there and should make for a good creepfest, except it isn't used much.
The bad guys are flies which are never seen clearly, although sometimes their perspective is employed by jerky camera moves that detract very strongly from the story.  These jerk action moves are very obviously done on a tripod as all the jerks are across one direction or span. Whats more, the actual cinematography is poor.  Sometimes, there would be a sweep across abandonned buildings (which we are told in an interesting story onc e housed the quarantined sick and then, later, the mad. This plotline is never brought up again) that goes right to left and then, inexplicably reversed halfway. Bad filming.
The flies themselves are laughable and there is no gore worth watching.
We should have a separate discussion about any movie starring Malcolm ""If-Theres-A-Check-Involved-I-am-So-There"" McDowell.  He phones in his performance, pretty much like he's done in every movie since Tank Girl (last decent performance from him that I saw).
It has NOTHING to do with the Dead Universe, despite the title. Some people do die but their deaths are ridiculous.
The only person worth watching was the island manager, who actually was kind of interesting. I've never seen him before, have no idea what his name is, but he was pretty cool.
Mos Def is also in the movie, for the inane rap music connection.",1089676800,,1991,4.832844574780059
