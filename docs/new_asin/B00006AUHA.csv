1739516,5,B00006AUHA,"I don't even remember when I first saw this show, but I fell in love in that instant!  The premise of the show is touching, and those who are only familiar with Judi Dench's movie performances will be delighted by her comic timing.  All in all this is a fantastic series and I cannot wait for the whole series to be issued on DVD so I can own each one!",1076889600,7,352,4.014285714285714
1739517,4,B00006AUHA,"Okay,I have never met a British TV series that I didn't like,so it comes as no surprise to anyone who knows me that I own Sets 1-V of As Time Goes By. It is a gentle, civilized comedy about two lovers separated by a undelivered letter forty years before the series opens in c. 1992. Judy Dench and Geoffrey Palmer, as Jean and Lionel, are the perfect middle age lovers: Jean has lines on her face, is not a stick in a size 0 dress, and Lionel has jowls and thinning hair. It matters not! They adore each other and we adore them! The supporting cast is excellent -- especially the young women who portray Judy and Sandy, Jean's daughter by her first marriage, and her assistant respectively. Nothing very profound can be resolved in 30 minutes, but what is is interesting is the process of rediscovery, falling in love, and learning to love and accept each other, ""warts and all,"" that the viewer sees in episode after episode. It is refreshing to see that someone believes that love is just not for the under 30 set. Jean and Lionel are never treated as ""cute,"" as in ""how cute that people that age can be in love."" Why they even have sex -- always implied and never seen -- and it is treated as a natural and normal state of being for a middle aged couple. Buy the series -- you won't be sorry!",1047513600,68,1295,4.311475409836065
1739518,4,B00006AUHA,"Imagine my excitement when I found that the first two seasons of ""As Time Goes By"" are heading for the DVD format. It is simply a wonderful series, well-deserving of such good video treatment. The previous season to be released on DVD (season 4) looked absolutely stunning in the crystal clear format. The images just came alive. Very beautiful. I already own these episodes on VHS, but there is no question that I will more than happily re-buy them.
""As Time Goes By"" begins here with Lionel Hardcastle (the sublime Geoffrey Palmer) needing a secretary to help type-up the manuscript to his new book ""My Life In Kenya"". The secretarial agency he hires is run by Jean Pargetter (the great Judi Dench). Lionel and Jean meet, and realize that they used to be sweethearts 38 years previous, in the few short months before Lionel was sent away to the Korean War. After they parted, they lost touch, got re-married, and moved on with their lives. Now Jean is widowed and Lionel is divorced, and the stage is set for a possibly warm reunion.
Warm is not the word to describe the first season, however. The romance is very up and down, and there are actually other *possible* love interests that come into the fray. But the season does have its positively sweet moments -- pre-cursors of the enjoyable situations to come. And I found the up & down nature of the romance at first one of the more believable elements. Relationships aren't always easy, whether new or old, and to show that two people who are really meant for each other may hit some bumps along the way, almost makes the romance that much more satisfying when things start working out.
I love ""As Time Goes By"". There are very few TV series that I can say that about - less than I can count on one hand - but this is one of them. The writing is always impeccable, the acting superb, and the stories warm and funny. And on DVD, it all looks great. I wish more shows were like it.",1025136000,80,1935,4.484419263456091
1739529,5,B00006AUHA,"I think that Geoffrey Palmer and Judi Dench are the dream team. They have been friends for many years, starting when they were first auditioning for stage roles in London's east end. Because they and their families are good friends, working together looks seamless. I own the complete ""As Time Goes By"" series and the later specials. I only wish there were more of them.",1476230400,,370,4.707692307692308

It has its moments, but overall my ""average American"" tastes don't find alot of the jokes funny and some of the acting isn't really top notch.  If want to watch a funny British show, although pretty old now, check out ""Are You Being Served"", the acting seems a bit more natural and the humor is a bit less dry.",1471132800,,395,4.253333333333333

1739585,5,B00006AUHA,"I am now re-watching this older series. I enjoyed it the first time around, because I generally enjoy British movies and their well-acted serious or eccentric characters. I had seen Judi Dench in films and liked her and then someone recommended this show because of her. The premise of it is not too far fetched, as it involves an older couple who were lovers too long ago just before the Great War (as it was called). She was a nurse and he went to war, and their letters to each other were never received. There meeting again is quite accidental, the man (Geoffrey Palmer) having never returned home after the war finally does and searches for a secretary at Judi Denches secretarial office. He first meets her daughter, as she quickly falls a little bit for him, until she brings him home so she can change for dinner, while both former lovers think they know who each is. And so start the questions at dinner about his companion's mother, annoying her while Judi Dench searches her photo album and discovers it is him. There first meeting together after all the time gone by exposes both serious hurts and accusations, along with sentimental humor. Is it Fate or are there just enough feelings still left to start anew, while the daughter and co-worker imaginatively hope to contrive to get the passions moving quickly, with the thinking of another age. This is a lightly humorous series and there are still the same situations of awkward re-introductions for both young and older.",1430870400,,1485,4.737451737451737

1739623,4,B00006AUHA,"There are no big laughs, no farcical situations, and the premise is like the set-up of a sappy paperback... but ""As Time Goes By"" is an endlessly endearing, gentle, funny show that gives it's main characters something many people don't get... a second chance at love.  A blissful, halcyon romance in 1953 between a nurse named Jean and a soldier named Lionel is cut short when the soldier was posted to Korea during the war... he wrote her a letter but it never arrived and their lives went in different directions.  Thirty-eight years later they have a chance encounter when Jean's daughter brings home a date in the form of a much older man, who is of course the solder she was in love with all those years ago.
""As Time Goes By"" is just consistently good, on a quiet, gentle level it's true... but that's why it is so universally loved.  Series 1 sets all the characters up, throws the two former lovebirds together for the first time in nearly four decades and watches them fight their set-ways and cynicism to recognize they need each other.  This series also sets up a few running plots through the show (an unusual practice in a British sitcom but it works) like Lionel's self-admittedly dull book about his life in Kenya as a coffee planter called... wait for it... ""My Life in Kenya"".  By Series 2 they are officially ""seeing each other"", acknowledging that they have both been lonely without each other and they each bring a little spark of life back to their bland existence.  The show begins in the present (circa 1992... there are never any flashbacks to those months of 1953 when they were young) and the story of this once hot couple is only gradually pieced together as the former young lovers try to get to know each other again.  They are wary of one another, standoffish because the decades between their courtship have not been kind to them and they are tougher, older, more cynical people.  But some of the best moments of ""As Time Goes By the Complete Series 1 & 2"", especially Series 1, is when Jean and Lionel collectively recollect the passionate love they once had for one another.  The best episode of Series 1 ""The Copper Kettle"" (the third episode of disc 1), has Jean and Lionel search for a fondly remembered country hotel, only to get lost and in a mess on the way there, but then towards the end there is a beautiful little conversation when they recall the first night they made love, without a hint of smut but plenty of fondness and tenderness... the old cynics sound a little more like the young people they once were in that scene.
The cast is a big part of what makes the show... what other show can say they have Judi Dench as a main character?  She and Geoffrey Palmer have a nice, low burning chemistry that we can see through the initial bickering of their first encounters.  The other cast mates fill things out nicely, with Jean's daughter Judith (Moira Brooker), Jean's secretary Sandy (Jenny Funnel) and Lionel's ""child"" yuppie book publisher Alistair Deacon (Philip Bretherton).
It's a funny, gentle look at what can happen when you get a second chance in love... and it can only get better from there!",1411862400,,3150,4.597147950089126

1739723,5,B00006AUHA,"I discovered this wonderful show on PBS earlier this year and was so glad to find it available on DVD. The stellar cast is led by the incomparable Dame Judi Dench, whose character re-connects with an old flame played by the terrific Geoffrey Palmer. Having seen many of the later episodes it was a bit strange seeing Lionel as a visitor to the house and not as a resident, and to see the characters interaction in the beginning, as opposed to the close family they all became in later years. For instance, it might come as a surprise to some (like me) to discover that at one time Alistair had a thing for Jean, and Judy had a thing for Lionel!

I plan to collect all the DVD's in the series. Bravo to the cast and crew of ""As Time Goes By"".",1251763200,,741,4.21830985915493

1739747,5,B00006AUHA,"Lionel and Jean had a breif encounter at the beginning of the Korean war. But when Lionel's letter gets lost, they both assume that it was just one of those things.

Series 1 (they have series not seasons in the UK)

Flash forward 45 years later.  Jean is a widow with a daughter.  She runs a secretarial agency.  Lionel has spent his time in Kenya.  He had a coffee plantation but is escaping a bad marriage with no kids.

Lionel is writing his memiors and needs a secretary.  Enter Judith, Jean's daughter.  Eventually, Lionel and Jean meet up but neither is willing to make the first move.  Therefore, Judith decides to date Lionel.  While Lionel's publisher, Alister, takes a liking to Jean.  The series ends up on a double date.  When Judith and Alister poop out, Jean and Lionel finally connect.

Series 2

Jean and Lionel start to see each other. But the main storyline is Lionel's book.  It actually turns out that Alister is publishing the book because of a debt that his father owed Lionel's father.  In this series, Lionel's free spirited father, Rocky, is introduced and Rocky's housekeeper Mrs. Bale.

This is a two disc set.  Series 1 contains 6 episodes and Series 2 contains 7 episodes.

This is the beginning of a great series. (Seven more series to come)",1128902400,32,1272,4.618834080717488

1739749,5,B00006AUHA,"The beginning of one of the best comedy series, British OR American, I've ever seen.  And I'm as old as Lionel and Jean, so that's a lot of comedy shows.  Totally believable in true-life situations, each episode runs the gamut of frustration, tears, joy, compromise and, of course, what binds it all together, love.  The only downside is that there are three more years and thus far, no indication of when they are to be released.  We need years 7, 8 and 9!",1093046400,8,457,4.469879518072289

Ex-lovers meet again after 40 years apart and pick-up where they left off. Great cast and funny situations as Jean and Lionel rediscover love.

Thank you PBS for bring great programming like As Time Goes By, Keeping Up Appearances, Waiting for God, Vicious, Wallander, Endeavor, Silk, Morse, Inspector Lewis, Sherlock Holmes, Last Tango in Halifax. Without you, I would have never been exposed to these quality shows, but would have instead grown-up thinking that the greatest contribution to sitcoms by the British was the disgusting Benny Hill Show.",1489536000,,697,5.114035087719298
