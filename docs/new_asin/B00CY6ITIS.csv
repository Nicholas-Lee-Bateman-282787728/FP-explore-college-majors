5751749,1,B00CY6ITIS,"Acting, wooden not helped by dialogue. Over the top shock value before titles doesn't seem to have any bearing on the plot. This doesn't matter because there is no plot.  The most ridiculous self indulgent movie I've seen in ages.  Gets 1 star because it's just over 80 minutes running time. It is still painful viewing.",1397174400,2,320,4.696428571428571
5751750,5,B00CY6ITIS,"For those who follow the output of creative filmmaker Jorge Ameer, his newest film will surprise. THE DARK SIDE OF LOVE figures less with the underbelly of same sex love than it does with familial relationships.

Two brothers, gay waiter Julian (Carlos Salas) and his drug addicted brother Michael (Jason Susaq) are the main characters of this story, though at the beginning Ameer lets us believe we are on another journey. At an auction for charity straight bachelor Steven (Harsha First) is auctioned for a five day `experience' to what he believes to be a wealthy lady, but in a quick change the winner gives her lucky number paddle to the handsome young waiter Julian who then by default wins five days with the man. This interlude of gradual acceptance is interrupted by the death of the Julian's mother and Julian departs for his mother's home to carry out the mother's secret wishes. At the same time Michael is at the bottom of his luck, severely addicted, out of funds, and in a messy relationship with the beautiful Chanel (Raquel Rosser) and receives the message that his mother has died. The two brothers meet at the mother's home, a cremation takes place and through some tough recriminations and also tender exchanges the strength of family brought to focus by the death of the matriarch reunites the dissimilar men.

There are some interesting sidebars that for a moment seem to interfere with the direction of the story but in the end this is a heartwarming tale of the bond of family and the many manifestations of love. Grady Harp, June 13",1371168000,3,1557,4.762962962962963
5751751,5,B00CY6ITIS,"Jorge Ameer is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated directors working in gay cinema and I suspect that the reason for that is that he makes us think. His movies are always entertaining but they also have something extra that causes us to evaluate what we have seen. His new film, ""The Dark Side of Love"" takes a look at identity and destiny as if affects four people whose lives come together as they search for who they are and where they are going. Steven (Harsha First)) is our guide here and he takes us by the hand early on and leads us into the film. With the theme of the universality of love, we are shown the four characters who must make decisions that will affect their lives.

Two brothers; Julian (Carlos Salas), a waiter and gay, Michael (Jason Susag), an abusive drug addict fight to gain control of their lives which seem to be going in the wrong direction. Julian develops a crush on a bachelor (who he meets in a very clever way) while the other brother, because of his drug habit and his feelings about his gay brother, has lost touch with reality and has trouble controlling his life. The brothers have been estranged but they are forced to come together with the death of their mother so that they can plan her funeral--a taxing situation, to say the least. Since they do not get along, their ""relationship"" tests both of them. It is so very difficult to prepare for the death of a parent and even though everything may well be worked out ahead of time, the actual death is not just heartbreaking but trying. Regardless of how they feel about each other, they are brothers and even when tempers flare up and emotions get very high, they know that this is the time to say goodbye to the woman who gave them life. Each brother is forced to look within himself and deal with his feelings, his anger and range and his prejudices.

Steven, our bachelor is looking for a wife and he is not really in the picture like the brothers but his role becomes very important later. When Julian goes home to prepare for the funeral, Steve surprisingly appears at his home with the excuse that Julian should not have to face the ordeal alone. What is so interesting here is that Steven maintains that he is straight and the he and Julian actually only met several days before. There is another character, Chanel (Raquel Rossner), Michael's girlfriend who comes along with Michael when he goes home to bury his mother.

As the brothers prepare to say goodbye to their mother, old wounds are reopened and they are forced to deal with the fact that what was once a family is no more. The death of the mother is the pivot around which the film revolves. As we enter the world of Julian, Michael, Steven and Chanel, we find that each is searching for identity and we are part of that quest.

This is a dark film as the name suggests and the beginning is quite shocking. The cinematography goes right along with the theme of darkness and there are few scenes with bright light. Some might find this depressing but I actually found it interesting especially when we see light at the end.

Ameer not only directs but he also wrote the screenplay and produced and actually appears in a small role. I must say that it took me a bit to get into the film but I soon found myself glued to the screen as I watched and I wanted to know how everything would turn out. The actors give fine performances and I found myself at one point thinking about the meaningfulness of life. When Julian goes to the funeral home (before he is aware of the details his mother has left for her sons) to pick out a coffin, I found myself thinking that after having lived on earth for a lifetime, we are relegated to spend eternity in a box somewhere beneath the earth and that bothers me. I do not know why I never thought about it before and I find it very interesting that it was Ameer's film that brought that home. We are all just passing through and when it is over, it is over.",1370217600,7,3959,4.395634379263302

5751753,2,B00CY6ITIS,"I didn't quite get this one. It set itself up to go in so many different directions, but it failed to complete any of the story lines. The beginning is much better than the end, which seems to happen extremely prematurely. Talk about a writer leaving the ending up to the viewer. This could have been such a better movie if the writer completed a thought. The sad part is that the actors were good and the characters were convincing. Its a shame that  this vehicle left them without the ability to complete their roles.",1466985600,,519,4.463157894736842

5751755,1,B00CY6ITIS,"I agree with Drew.  This is embarrassing bad and, by that, I mean everything EXCEPT the story,  Directing, acting, . . . you name it, just not good.  I knew people in ""Acting 101"" who performed better.  Cinematography, direction, production. . . did you see the boom shadows on the wall?  Did you see the body mic bumps that always seemed to show?  The story of 2 opposite brothers coming together after the death of their mother is what appealed to me.  This movie does NOT portray that!",1466208000,,488,4.4772727272727275

5751765,1,B00CY6ITIS,"UNFORTUNATELY ONE CAN NOT GIVE IT LESS THAN ONE STAR. THE PROBLEM WITH MOST REVIEWS IS THAT MOST PEOPLE ONLY CHECK PREVIOUS REVIEWS AFTER WATCHING A FILM, TO SEE HOW OTHERS FELT.  THIS WAS A POINTLESS WASTE OF TIME, WITH THE REALLY SAD PART BEING THAT THE MOVIE HAD SOME POTENTIAL BUT IT WAS LOST ON THE SCRIPT.

5751766,1,B00CY6ITIS,Horrible slow moving very poor acting. Plot is hard to follow. Maybe re shoot the video using sign language and subtitles. It might be a little more convincing if the actors breathe in helium before speaking,1456358400,2,207,4.777777777777778
5751767,1,B00CY6ITIS,"Execrable.  I have seen for reasons too embarrassing to explain too many movies with gay themes or characters that are embarrassing to watch.  They make you wince for the poor acting, the improbable plotting, the awkward, clich ridden dialogue, the lack of any cinematographic eye, the sloppy editing, the stupidity in almost every way that they display, the amateurism in everything they do.  What has been the worst of them would be hard to determine, but The Dark Side of Love is certainly on that list.  Its story is nonsensical and illogical, the acting is uniformly inept,  truly cringe worthy, and the dialogue sounds as if it were written by half literate adolescents.  The director seems to think he is making an art film.  But he has deluded himself.  In brief, this is a bad movie in every conceivable way.  I don't enjoy saying that.  But I felt punished for some crime I never committed just by watching it.",1444953600,6,920,4.729559748427673
5751768,3,B00CY6ITIS,This movie was hard to follow. There were way too many bits that did not add up not even in the end.  too many unexplained things that made this movie very much like a Picasso painting gone awry.  The filming was good and the acting was pretty good but I still feel like I smelled a beautiful three course meal and got pulled away from the table before it was served.,1436054400,3,367,4.154929577464789

5751771,1,B00CY6ITIS,"Disjointed and pointless,the movie left you hanging at the end . Unless you want to be completely confused ( and really annoyed) I would suggest not wastng the money or time on this film- I do think that given a real script the actor who played Julian could do great things- he was deterred by a useless script and the poor acting around him.",1426377600,7,342,4.359375

8587460,1,B00CY6ITIS,"The plot of this film seemed to be about Julian and Stephen somehow growing together in friendship and love.  A story line annihilated like the asteroid crash that ended the age of dinosaurs.  So Mr. Director and Mr. Screenplay Writer, what the heck happened?  Did you run out of money?  Did you lose interest in your own production?  Hats off to the guys who portrayed Julian and Stephen.  Though amateurish, they had a chemistry when together and they both gave their best efforts to this project.  As for the rest of the production company, shame, shame on you all.",1480982400,,568,4.6767676767676765
8587461,1,B00CY6ITIS,"Unfortunately, I cannot give this a good review -- this one was bad, and not one of those where you can smirk that its so bad that it's good, just embarrassingly bad. The acting was particularly atrocious -- for instance, check out ""Julian"" trying to project grief at his mother's passing--or the fight scene between the brothers at the end where the dialogue was so poor and the simulation of deep seated sibling rage so lame that you suspect any number of six year-olds might have done a better job. Must say though that the rumor of certain women indulging in the practice of sneaking portions of the menstrual cycle into a man's food in order to hold and control him is one I've never seen depicted before. However, the picture does not live up to its rather grandiose title. The best that can be said is that the two male leads were very attractive.",1479168000,,854,4.516129032258065

8587464,3,B00CY6ITIS,It was alright. I only watched it because of Matthew Montgomery. And he only had one scene which was very disappointing. The barer of bad news. what the hell. I love the score though. I think the whole movie needs to be redone with Matthew as one of the main characters.,1473379200,,270,4.313725490196078
8587465,3,B00CY6ITIS,"There is a story embedded in it, one just has to be very patient to get to it, I think a lot of the reviews were a bit harsh, I do agree that the acting skills at least on the supporting cast needed improvement, except of course Mathew Montgomery, He was excellent in his very short input. I am by no means a critic, not professional anyway lol, The biggest things I can tell you as an average viewer are 1> Too much clarifying, were not stupid, we can figure out what was meant without a Webster's.  2> I would say without a doubt that the middle of the movie for whatever reason was edited out and that would explain why many reviewers were lost, I pieced together that right before they cut it there was apparently a scene that brought the whole boy/girl friend thing on the couch to light. 3> Too many mixed signals were sent out to the viewing audience, once again I think that pertinent parts that would explain were edited out. Over all there was a realistic story and I encourage the director and actors to continue on in their filed but maybe start thinking of it as they would like to see it.  Thanks for the movie, Douglas, Portland, Oregon",1472688000,,1151,4.324074074074074
8587466,5,B00CY6ITIS,"I loved this film.  Although it was the same story about boy meets boy, boy loses boy...It was nice how they moved back and forth between the characters past, and what was happening now to tell and complete the story.  Watched it twice.",1470700800,,236,4.465116279069767
