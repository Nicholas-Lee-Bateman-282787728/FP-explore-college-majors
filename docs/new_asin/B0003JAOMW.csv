8035993,5,B0003JAOMW,Blade is a very good vampire series. It is dark and action packed. A vampire who can walk in the daylight. The second one has the better fight scence with the main villian.. These 2 are the best out of the series. Part 3 was cool but the story is better in these. Worth owning if you like vampire movies,1361318400,,303,4.066666666666666
8035994,5,B0003JAOMW,I also felt cheated by not having the Blade 2 disc. I was buying it for the special features and the commentaries. But guess I'll have to plunk down another 18 bucks for the 2 disc set.,1102291200,8,185,4.027027027027027
8035995,3,B0003JAOMW,"If you're looking to buy this for the movies alone and not the extras, then I recommend the 2-pack.  If you're interested in the extra features, then buy the dvd's separately because  Blade 2 is a ""movie only"" dvd and doesn't include the audio commentary or any of the other extra materials on the Platinum Version.  The extra look at Blade 3 has 25 minutes of footage from a sci-fi convention where David Goyer, Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds talk about the film.  It has three extra snippets of Blade 3 and includes the trailer.  It's not bad, but I feel cheated with the non-platinum Blade 2.",1102118400,10,595,4.5233644859813085
8035996,5,B0003JAOMW,Even if you own the first Blade you should still get the 2 pack for the trinity preview and the plastic keepcase that the first blade comes in. The first Blade originally came in a horrible carboard case that snaps shut. At Least this way you can keep your set looking like new. Blade 2 is not bad for those who haven't seen it yet but the first Blade is the Best!,1098057600,5,364,4.069444444444445
