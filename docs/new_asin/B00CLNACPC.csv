5726267,5,B00CLNACPC,"Great Indie Film.  It's quirky and interesting, got a lot of different themes.  To environmental economics, healthy eating consciousness to personal choices and consequences. The characters are everyday people and can't help to think that there's some of Paul Gordon (creator/director/lead actor)in Bill.  It's intellectually creative, love Indie Films!  This quite good:)",1375920000,4,372,6.096153846153846
5726268,5,B00CLNACPC,"A true sleeper film, The Happy Poet stayed under the radar for far too long.  The plot is simple; a guy with a dream of running an almost vegetarian food cart decides to make his dream come true. But after he buys a used hot dog cart, the pressure is on to compromise by selling hot dogs, while suffering help from a cast of iconic Austin characters.

Filmed before the Austin food trailer scene evolved from fad to phenomenon, indie film fans who've spent any time in Austin will recognize the charm, and the weirdness, and not a few outstanding Austin based actors.

The humor is often dry, with a healthy dose of heart, you just may find yourself craving an eggless egg salad, and wondering what writer/director/actor Paul Gordon will be doing next.",1374537600,4,752,4.597014925373134
8583136,5,B00CLNACPC,"We laughed a lot. The Happy Poet is monotone and funny . There is no music , but every once in a while you will hear one note, a piano key,i think it's A.The one note is funny, in and of itself. It reminds me of tuning your violin in orchestra. Towards the end of the movie, sometimes there will be 2 notes or a chord. I think Bill gets contacts and maybe that makes him happy. He speaks very slowly and you enjoy when he talks to the people he borrowed money from...",1529107200,,467,3.978723404255319

8583139,1,B00CLNACPC,I was the Happiest Poet when this was over.! Im a positive person so I kept watching and watching in disbelief no magical moments hoping for some worth.....nothing except the food looked good. not good with slow monotone speaking either.,1525996800,,237,4.95
8583140,4,B00CLNACPC,"A questionable poet, whose outlandish, erotic to skanky, examplar youll hear later on in the film, secures the smallest small business loan ever, to undertake his one-cart food enterprise.  This, now financed-by-seller, second-hand cart, plastered with hot dog images, will offer up a lot of eggless egg salad sandwiches and no hot dogs. Bill (Paul Gordon) meticulously forms the sandwiches, wraps them, and binds them with what appears to be masking or medical tape. Supply is plentiful but demand de minimis.  Enter Donny (Jonny Mars), a foul-talking, driven, scooter-driving, self-appointed ad man, delivery man, publicist, and wingman. But he may be delivering a seriously off-menu item. The piece is funny in an unhurried style and delivery much like the protagonists. The ending is a bit contrived but, on the whole, its a successful amusing Indie, written and directed by its star, Paul Gordon, and solidly performed by all, with Jonny Mars as a standout.",1524700800,,962,5.240259740259741

8583143,5,B00CLNACPC,"awesomely sweet movie, it's the poets and visionaries that make the world go round portrayed in Austin's stoner culture.",1473724800,,120,5.368421052631579
8583144,5,B00CLNACPC,"I don't really know what could have made this better.  It's a charming story about a man who had good intentions to the point that his good heart appears to be his greatest flaw.  It's a gentle story that goes at its own pace... brisk enough to keep one's interest while not abandoning the viewer in the creator's vision.  If you'd like a break from Hollywood, this film will entertain you - even if you don't think you like indie films.  Well worth your time.",1384732800,3,460,4.376470588235295
