8334330,3,B001PPLJNQ,"""Mars: The Quest for Life"" is a mediocre Discover Channel TV episode about the efforts to get the 2008 Phoenix Lander to land on Mars safely. The movie ""Roving Mars"" is far better, and on a similar topic. ""Mars: The Quest for Life"" talks about the purpose of the Phoenix Lander, but it mostly focuses on the difficult task of landing it on Mars. The show is available on Blu-ray, but the visuals are not very interesting. The disc had no extras, whereas ""Roving Mars"" has a lot. I recommend instead seeing ""Roving Mars"", ""MARS Dead or Alive: Nova"", ""Welcome to Mars: Nova"", and ""Is There Life on Mars?: Nova"".

Maybe on an other DVD ?",1242604800,6,141,4.2592592592592595
