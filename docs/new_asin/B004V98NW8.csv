4482175,5,B004V98NW8,"Unlike many series where the writers obviously run out of new ideas, this masterful French drama series continues with the same edgy, heart pounding pace as the previous two series. Watch it - love it!",1372723200,,201,4.771428571428571
4482176,5,B004V98NW8,"I do not understand why the other person wrote that season 3 was like the movie "" silence of the lamb"", I do not agree at all, nothing to compare Spiral season 3 to that film. The actors were great and the stories kept me glued to my screen. Great thriller. I can't wait until season 4 comes out.",1355184000,4,296,4.033898305084746
4482177,1,B004V98NW8,MHZ - there is no 5th season for Spiral.  It goes back to the first episode of Season 1.  Please tell me how to get this change removed.,1494892800,,136,3.8214285714285716
4482178,5,B004V98NW8,Nicely done.,1486166400,,12,5.5
4482179,5,B004V98NW8,Love it--better than Homeland! Could only get the first season from Netflix so went out and bought the second and third.  Wish there were more.,1485043200,,143,4.72
4482180,3,B004V98NW8,"Dark pessimistic view, lots of corruption among police, law, govt -- Lead detective far too emotional/impulsive/undisciplined and crosses lines right/left - but she cares about team and catching bad guys.  Well done in many ways - but hopefully things are not really like this in France",1484438400,,286,5.217391304347826
4482181,5,B004V98NW8,Excellent french cop series. It is graphic and violent.some major twists.,1479081600,,73,5.7272727272727275
4482182,1,B004V98NW8,"too crazy, too violent, bodies cut like salamies penises, vaginas cut, breasts hacked and cut, etc.",1475193600,,99,5.25
4482183,5,B004V98NW8,Great series and worth every penny. But watch it free on Netflix and don't make the mistake I did and pay Amazon for what you can get free on your Netflix subscription.,1475020800,,168,4.28125
4482184,5,B004V98NW8,"Though this is not a perfect show, it is so well done on many fronts that I forgive it for its shortcomings.  This show is meant to portray the gritty reality of the modern criminal justice system in France, primarily Paris.  It mostly avoids that ever so common and utterly annoying immaturity that I find in so many French film and TV shows, especially those from 1960-1990.  Specifically, adolescent shock, cheap social platitudes calling for class warfare, exaggerated irony, ridiculous plotting.... instead, Spiral plays it almost as straight as the best of the American NY noir crime dramas of the early 1970s, like The Seven Ups for example.  We really do come to care for the main characters, even if in different ways.  Some are tragic heroes and some are ne'er-do-wells, but with soft spots.  No matter the type, we recognize their circumstances and the professional situations in which they find themselves to be shockingly similar to our own circumstances, no matter what our careers have been.  We join them in the outrage against professional nepotism, cronyism, petty and grand corruption, jealousy, territorial-ism, over-bearing superiors, desk-bound incompetent bureaucrats, and all the other ""slings and arrows"" of the modern corporate/government institutional organism.  The characters' slow descent into various levels of stress-induced psychological and professional breakdown is all too familiar to most viewers.  Though we've seen many of the plots and subplots before elsewhere, it is a fact that there are no new crimes, only new manners of bringing them to ""justice""...or not.  I've fallen for this bunch of Parisian police, judges, and lawyers, and am glad to see French story-telling finally shed it's 1960s callowness.",1473120000,,1747,5.343065693430657
4482185,5,B004V98NW8,All of the Spiral Series has been great and I would highly recommend.  I also have viewed The Bridge (Danish/Swedish with sub-titles and loved those too.)  Spiral is both realistic and gritty plus you can't always figure out where it's going which is always better watching.,1455926400,,274,4.934782608695652
4482186,5,B004V98NW8,Love this show.... and it makes me feel like I speak French.,1452988800,,60,4.083333333333333

4482188,5,B004V98NW8,Worth seeing.,1442361600,,13,6.0
4482189,4,B004V98NW8,"An odd combination of histrionics and competency.  If there is a car chase or a person being pursued, these police will lose them.  The head of the unit, a woman, is oddly emotional and out of control at crucial moments.  And yet, they still get their perpetrator!  Uncanny requiring a long suspension of disbelief.  Worth it from a cultural perspective, they are French, or maybe just a curiosity.  I watched all of the seasons.",1441929600,,429,4.72972972972973
4482190,5,B004V98NW8,"One of the best series ever, this stands way above most of what's done here in the States.",1441152000,,90,4.055555555555555

4482198,5,B004V98NW8,This series was not aired in the UK but is as good as the others.,1427414400,,65,3.4
4482199,2,B004V98NW8,"I love this series, Engrenages, five stars, but this DVD has problems. It cost nearly twice as much as seasons 1,2, and 4. Also, when you put the first DVD in, a recap from a different plays. Then you're left wondering if they've mismarked the DVD. The DVDs are labeled incorrectly. For example, the second DVD is labeled episodes 3 and 4, but 3, 4, and 5 are on it..., bizarre stuff like that. It gets confusing to remember where you left off n this case. What a mess. Best to buy this elsewhere.",1426550400,,497,4.297872340425532
4482200,5,B004V98NW8,Complex interwoven story. Very good.,1425254400,,36,6.4

4482204,4,B004V98NW8,"Love this series, but you really need to know the differences in how the French Legal system is set up and that in the US to appreciate this series.",1407801600,,148,4.137931034482759
4482205,1,B004V98NW8,"I love this series but in my 4 DVD set I received - Disc 1 Episodes 1& 2, Disc 2 Episodes 3 & 4, Disc 3 Epiisodes 7 & 8, Disc 4 Episodes 7,8 and 9.  No Episodes 5 & 6.  Was not happy. Update - I went back through each DVD and have found that the labels on all 4 are incorrect. The first 2 DVD's are labeled as containing 2 Episodes each but actually contain 3 which accounts for the missing Episodes.  The 3rd DVD is labeled 5 and 6 but actually contains 7,8, and 9.  The 4th is labeled 7 & 8 but contains 10,11 and 12.  All episodes are there but all DVD's are labeled incorrectly.  Therefore I would raise my rating to 4 stars.  The series is good but the labels on all disc's are completely wrong. Obviously there is no quality control there.",1394928000,7,745,3.959731543624161
4482206,5,B004V98NW8,"Character and story(ies) development is fascinating.  The script is intelligent and the characters are lifelike.  The tensions among the characters are believable, especially with the testy Maitre Karlsson.",1379289600,,206,6.321428571428571

8443093,5,B004V98NW8,"Spiral just keeps getting better. There are some great European crime series, Beck, Wallander, The Bridge, Happy Valley, Witnesses, Line of Duty but Spiral tops them all. A mother and  child are dragged from the Seine chained together, its down to Laure and her team to catch the killer. AS usual they bend and break the rules and often mess things up Set in North Eastern Paris do not expect to many shots of the Eiffel Tower.",1516492800,,427,4.545454545454546
8443094,5,B004V98NW8,"On a short list of Crime dramas, at the top of the list along with Wallander, Beck, Maigret, and Morse.  Highly recommended for the person interested in story, culture, mystery, and good production values.",1515196800,,205,5.029411764705882
8443095,5,B004V98NW8,"Season 6 has been released.  PLEASE MHz  give us #6.  One of the very best detective series available. The plots are literate and suspenseful, and the acting is superb.
