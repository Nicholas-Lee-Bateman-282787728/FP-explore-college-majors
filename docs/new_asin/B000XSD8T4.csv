8229388,5,B000XSD8T4,Animated Gio Train rides through his day while actual pictures and facts about trains teach little ones about different types of trains and what they are used for. Engaging music in the background completes the experience. My son watches it several times a day with his favorite train in his hand!,1396742400,,297,4.8431372549019605
8229389,5,B000XSD8T4,"This is not at all what I expected when I ordered it, but I am pleasantly surprised! I ordered this expecting more episodes of 'Team Geo Trax'. However, when it came it turned out to be a brief intro with animated Geo from Geo Trax land, and then lovely train clips and images, set to nice music and interesting facts. My kids love this one! Well done!",1384560000,,352,4.268656716417911

8229394,4,B000XSD8T4,"Not quite what I had expected when I ordered the movie.  I thought it was going to be more like the Geo Trax movies, but instead it is 3 seperate movies, one is a cartoon and the others are of real trains and cartoons combined.  Very short movie, but keeps my son entertained.",1282262400,2,276,4.188679245283019
