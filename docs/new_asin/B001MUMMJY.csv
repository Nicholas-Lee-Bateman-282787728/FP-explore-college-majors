3700483,5,B001MUMMJY,I had missed out watching this old movie. I like to watch old crime movies. This is one of the famous ones. DVD of this movie is not easily available. Thanks to Amazon.com for making it available to me.,1361059200,,202,4.205128205128205

3700485,4,B001MUMMJY,"You really do need to love Anne Baxter in order to fully appreciate CHASE A CROOKED SHADOW. Thankfully I'm a huge fan, in particular her roles in ""The Ten Commandments"", ""The Blue Gardenia"", ""The Razor's Edge"", and ""Three Violent People""; not to mention her signature, Academy Award-nominated performance as the title character in ""All About Eve"".

In CHASE A CROOKED SHADOW, Baxter is diamond heiress Kimberley Prescott. Living a typically glamorous lifestyle on the Costa Brava, Kim is stunned one evening when a man (Richard Todd) claiming to be her dead brother Ward arrives on her patio. Everyone seems to believe him to be genuine, except Kim who identified Ward's body after the car-crash that supposedly killed him. Kim starts to believe she's going mad, until a sympathetic police chief (Herbert Lom) decides there's more than meet's the eye with Ward's resurrection...

You'll never ever guess the surprise ending! Needless to say, the film is full of twists and turns; we're never quite sure of who to believe or what motives are driving ""Ward"" in his quest to come back into Kim's life. Anne Baxter, with her honeyed and cultured speaking voice, is a perfect fit for the glamorous Kim and chews the scenery appropriately.

A tight, gripping thriller which clips along at a brisk 84 minutes. Definitely one of Anne Baxter's better movie vehicles. Recommended.",1292716800,8,1370,5.053097345132743
3700486,4,B001MUMMJY,Chase a crooked shadow is one of the best suspense movie I have ever seen. It is too bad that the movie is not available in DVD or even VHS format. It is not included in the TCM classics. I would highly recomend Amazon to get this movie on their movie list. Thanks.,1263254400,4,265,4.018867924528302

8321850,4,B001MUMMJY,"Love this film. A stellar cast,and a big fan of Anne Baxter. The film takes you on a roller coaster ride about a woman ( Baxter) as a south african heiress living in Spain. Her father has died,and her brother also - in a car accident. And then,her brother turns up 9 Richard Todd).Which,as you can guess,throws Baxter. She,of course,does not accept him as her brother. Throw in Herbert Lom ( pre Inspector Dreyfuss) as the local cop.

This is a doozy of a film with a real twist at the end. Highly recommended.",1520899200,,510,4.425531914893617

8321853,5,B001MUMMJY,"Great film. Amazing how great movies are lost to time and viewing. Saw this on the Warner Archive streaming web site. Appreciate that since the dvd prices are overpriced. Additionally, just purchased an WB Archive dvd, the Men of the Fighting Lady and the production was poor quality, grainy, uneven, the trailer was better transferred than the movie itself. Doubt I will purchase any more at these prices, even with the Amazon discount. Regardless, thankful I had the chance to see this movie on the web site. Great story, slow build suspense, excellent cast and Anne Baxter acting up a storm and doing it excellently. Beautifully photographed in b and w in the noir style and with great direction and scenes, all in a perfect setting and landscape.",1445731200,2,750,4.8671875

8321856,5,B001MUMMJY,"I wasn't familiar with this little gem from 1958 until it arrived as a Warner Archive DVD. I love twisty mysteries, so I gave it a look. Michael Anderson followed his Oscar for Best Picture for AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS (1956) with this shadowy, well-made thriller. A diamond heiress living on the Costa del Sol in Spain (Anne Baxter) is suddenly confronted by a sinister stranger (Richard Todd) claiming to be her dead brother. She calls the police, and the local inspector (Herbert Lom) investigates. This obvious ""con job"" leads to a genuinely surprising turn of events.

From one of the biggest epics ever made to a small, intimate, 5-character thriller set in a remote Spanish villa: I'm really impressed with Michael Anderson's range. Anne Baxter is excellent, the rest of the cast is solid, and the production values are above average, particularly the music (with the great Julian Bream on guitar). It's a perfect movie for anyone who likes to be surprised. Highly recommended.",1430006400,2,987,4.910179640718563
