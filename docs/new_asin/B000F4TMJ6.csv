2551694,3,B000F4TMJ6,"While I have to agree that the plot just wasn't there, I think Mimi has a lot of potential yet to be realized.  I personally found her very entertaining in the action sequences, but did not find the film to be putting her ability to good use.  Better to put her skills to good use in a supporting role in a higher budget flick opposite people who can make the fight scenes believable.",991267200,,384,4.2465753424657535
2551695,1,B000F4TMJ6,"I'm not even sure you can even call it acting! The whole movie is just terrible, and Mimi Lesseos isn't too much of a heroine in this film. She plays a guide who leads people into the woods, and I think that was about as far as I could watch. The acting and fight scenes are campy, the script is no good and I think you get the picture. Perhaps they should have put her in a small, supporting role before going to lead actress?",973123200,,427,4.035294117647059
8117523,4,B000F4TMJ6,4:3 video and audio stereo. The story was different which is what I am going for these days. I still appreciated the action and violence. I liked the punching and kicking. That is why the producer made this movie; to display her martial arts prowess. Since I quit insisting on HD I have discovered that Amazon Prime will deliver the action and different movies.,1519344000,,361,4.65625

8117529,4,B000F4TMJ6,"She has appeal and the story was interesting, but the end was lousy choreography. Still the story was good and the characters learned about their loved one. It was like the Love Boat in the Woods.",1459382400,,196,4.472222222222222
8117530,3,B000F4TMJ6,"Pretty good story. If there is to be a lesson to be learnt from this, is that being too nosy could endanger a whole community. So if you want to be nosy, don't get caught in the act.",1458518400,,182,3.8157894736842106
