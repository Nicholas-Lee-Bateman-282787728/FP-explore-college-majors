6867982,1,B00QHL0QU0,"It has been a while since I saw the Dutchman.  I wish I had retained the past in memory and not puechased this video.  The producer of the opera  apparently wanted to show only the feeling of the opera and nothing more.  There is no sea, no sailors etc.  As the other reviewer said, ply this disc with no video. It is boring!!!",1431475200,2,327,4.126984126984127
6867983,1,B00QHL0QU0,"I have seen this opera five times and to me it always ""smell"" of sea Not this boring production. I suggest future buyers to play this DVD without Video. Terfel has the required voice but not the presence. I never felt any pity for him. There is no sense of mystery, the phantom ship appears nowhere. The seamstresses look like Nazi bank employees so are the sailors, who stii call themselves ""seereiters"" In fact the women look like men in travesti. The oldest recording I have of this opera is with Josef Metternich, and his is my favorite.
To me the only authentic of late productions is by Simon Estes.",1430352000,5,605,4.509090909090909

8691355,1,B00QHL0QU0,"What a terrible production of Dutchman! I can't even praise the singing. Terfel snarles his way through the role making him an unredeemable lout. Also, someone should explain to the English language translator that to render the German as ""the spooks are coming"" and then to show a black person is an offensive racial slur.",1497052800,,323,4.890909090909091
8691356,2,B00QHL0QU0,"There are times when Regie can expose nuances in a piece, which the Composer himself may have missed.
There are times when Regie can provide amusement by scurrying off in directions which may be utterly daft, but can be entertaining.
Unfortunately, there are also times where Regie gives the impression that it's just trying to save money.
This production comes into the third category.
Listen to the music - full of salt spray, the wind in your face, the sails straining against the gale, the phantom crew... Exciting and terrifying.
Now look at the production - set in a bank. Everyone else has horn rim glasses and pinstripe suits. The Dutchman has a top hat and an Astrakhan coat, which presumably makes him strange and exotic. Eric has a gun and dresses in green. Yep. That's a hunter. Senta steals the gun at the end. Not for her the symbolic sacrifice of jumping into the sea - just another suicide.
Pretty dull production, I'm afraid.",1487980800,,942,4.715151515151515
8691357,3,B00QHL0QU0,"Did you know that Wagner's ""Der fliegende Holl&auml;nder"" was an indictment of the Dutch East India Company's exploitation of the indigenous South African native?  Well, neither did I until I saw Andreas Homoki's completely loopy, but not uninteresting 2013 staging for Opernhaus Zurich.  It doesn't quite make sense -- which is putting it mildly -- but it's entertaining in an abstract, what-the-hell's-going-on? kind of way.  After a while, unfortunately, you realize that the answer is, ""Not much,"" which is not entirely Homoki's fault.  A fairly early opera in Wagner's career, it doesn't have the most cohesive libretto, with all of the dramatic tension pretty much resolved by the end of Act 2.  And, for that matter, we already know what Senta's answer to the Dutchman will be any number of scenes prior.  So the ""conflict"" of Act 3 is pretty much manufactured and unbelievable, at least by 21st century standards.  On the other hand, ""Il trovatore"" and ""La sonnambula"" hardly rate a 10 on the credibility scale, so why carp, right?  Better if you just go along with the whole male-chorus-getting-shot-with arrows bit -- yes, you read that right -- and not ask too many questions.  Bryn Terfel's Dutchman, anyway, is the raison d'tre for this filming in the first place, and he's absolutely splendid; no big surprise, but greatly to be appreciated.  Equally good are the Daland of opera great Matti Salminen and, in a much smaller role, the Helmsman of Fabio Tr&uuml;mpy.  Less successful, IMHO, are Anja Kampe, who's a little shrill in the upper register and Marco Jentzsch's callow, strident Erik.  Bottom line: This cockeyed, crazy interpretation of ""Der fliegende Holl&auml;nder"" maybe not be ideal, but until another, more conventional version with Terfel comes along, it will just have to do.  But if you can't stomach the unconventional, and it will interfere with your ability to enjoy the singing, stay far, far away.",1452816000,2,1933,5.079113924050633
8691358,2,B00QHL0QU0,"No singers can save this dreary production. The action is no longer takes place at sea, it takes place in an office on dry land. It is difficult to understand what the stage director wants to say with this, even if they try to explain it in the liner notes. Not even the singers do not seem inspired.

8691362,2,B00QHL0QU0,"We need 2 categories of stars. Performance? 5 stars. Production? 1 star.

I am trying with all my heart to accept modernized stagings of classic operas. Productions designers are doing everything possible to prevent me from loving new stagings. They are probably damaging the future of opera with self-centered, oblique productions.

So the 40's version of Faust with Kaufmann won me over to accepting some updates to operatic productions. I could take the Met's new Ring Cycle using the machine though I still prefer the 80's Met production because so much more feeling is conveyed by the singers.

I love the Flying Dutchman. It's short, interesting and packed with tunes that make you want to sing along. I wanted to love this production. I just don't. The business guys navigating the world for riches was okay. Acceptable. But anyone new to the opera and watching this production with subtitles on would be terribly confused. I've not seen a helmsman in a business office nor weavers singing of spinning all day on a typewriter.

The ""party scene"" is where I pretty much lost all hope. Forcing the black man to drink---presumably a rape enactment of Africa---was a bit over the top and nothing to do with Wagner's opera. The rape victim turns savage and shoots, with arrows, a few of the guys after his trusty spear  becomes a bow when he gets behind the curtain...I guess.

This begs the question. Does our Dutchman represent capitalism gone bad? No ship, no crew. Meh. And what's with the weird face paint? And fur coat? Terfel is sweating like he's trapped in a sauna...the coat was a bad idea. Watch closely and you can see a big sweat blob hit the desk as he leans over it. Ew.

The ending was funny and merciful. So what exactly was Senta's decision as expressed in this hodgepodge? Maybe she just wanted out of this opera. Can't blame her.

Well, the singing is great and I had fun watching it. (I received a Region 0 BluRay DVD by the way)

You can't hate anything with singing this good. Kampe by the way sings a beautiful Senta. I would love this performance on CD.

Let's get this same cast together and produce a traditional Dutchman for this BluRay generation. Please.",1433808000,,2186,4.698952879581152
8691363,4,B00QHL0QU0,"First..I'm not a critic and I like what I like.  Very much enjoyed Bryn Terfel and Matti S. in their roles.  The other singers were very good also.  DID NOT LIKE THE PRODUCTION!!!! If I wanted to see something from the 30'/40's I would have bought that.  There was no indication of sea fearing ships or sea fearing men, women spinning, etc.  Took away from the whole story. And with ""Senta"" running all over the place was very much a distraction and did not see any need for the African Native addition.  Tacky.  But ..... we all have our opinions.  I bought it because of Bryn Terfel and Matti S. Otherwise I would have given it 5+ stars.",1432252800,9,639,4.3559322033898304
