3547135,4,B001E95ZI8,"""The Rocker"" is a surprisingly enjoyable movie, with engaging performances, jokes that are suited for the material, and a fairly solid premise. I was consistently interested in what was going on, and I actually cared about the characters. In a sense, it's like a sports movie, in which we root for the heroes to fight the good fight and emerge victorious. I'm hard pressed to say it was any better than it wanted to be, however. Had this story been told dramatically, it probably would have been much more powerful; the rise to fame is not without its turmoil, especially when the celebrities are teenagers. The idea of an adult drummer leading a teenage rock band from the garage to the arena is full of emotionally charged possibilities. Many of them weren't explored because ""The Rocker"" was made as a comedy. But that's okay. It still works.

The story begins in 1986, just as a popular heavy metal band called Vesuvias finishes a gig in Cleveland. Despite their success, the drummer, Robert ""Fish"" Fishman (Rainn Wilson), is unceremoniously kicked out of the band. He swears that he'll make it no matter what, but when we flash forward twenty years, it's clear that things haven't worked out as planned; Fish spends his days doing the tasks of a soul-crushing desk job. When he's fired for unruly behavior (namely attacking a coworker for playing the new Vesuvias album), he's forced to leave his apartment and move in with his disapproving sister, Lisa (Jane Lynch), her thrill-seeking husband, Stan (Jeff Garlin), and their quarrelsome children, Violet (Samantha Weinstein) and Matt (Josh Gad). Matt and his high school friends Amelia (Emma Stone) and Curtis (Teddy Geiger) have formed a rock band called A.D.D.; after weeks of trying, they will finally have their first gig at the prom.

But there's a problem: the drummer was suspended from school and grounded by his mother. With little resources available, and with only one day to go until the gig, Matt asks Fish if he would be willing to once again pick up his drumsticks. Fish accepts, and when prom night arrives, everything goes smoothly. At least, it does at first; things go wrong when Fish ruins A.D.D.'s rendition of Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes."" When the smoke clears, everyone decides to give Fish another chance, but only if he can get them another gig. Then comes the night all four members practice with each other via webcams--Fish, not realizing the device on his laptop is a camera and not a microphone, sits completely naked at his drum set. ""Hello, YouTube,"" says Violet maliciously, watches everything on her computer.

Before anyone knows it, the video known as ""The Naked Drummer"" is an Internet sensation. It isn't long before a scummy L.A. agent named David Marshall (Jason Sudeikis) enters with promises of fame and fortune. Thus begins A.D.D.'s Midwest tour, in which they open for other various bands. Hopefully, this will pave the way to more serious venues, maybe even their first solo gig. Of course, nothing like this can happen without some trouble along the way; Fish, hoping to loosen up the other members, encourages reckless behavior, like destroying hotel rooms and attending wild parties (by some miracle, the issue of alcohol never comes up). While all the parents recognize that Fish is a bad influence, Curtis' mother, Kim (Christina Applegate), believes that the kids should follow their hearts. She volunteers to stay with the band for the rest of the tour to keep an eye on things.

At a certain point in the film, Fish is faced with a very tough decision. I won't reveal what it is, but I will say it creates the first real rift between him and the rest of the band. The question is raised: Was Fish always meant for a life of rock and roll, or is he just a sloppy, irresponsible dreamer that refuses to grow up? One could ask the same thing about most music superstars, which is why it's almost impossible to get an answer. Some are famous because they got lucky while other have actual talent. It seems that everyone in A.D.D. is talented enough: Fish certainly knows his way around a drum set; Amelia's good with a guitar, and Matt can really work a synthesizer; Curtis is a natural songwriter, although one wonders if he'll ever get past his abandonment issues. His father left him when he was only four, and he's been brooding about it ever since.

If this movie is, in fact, giving us a message, then it's probably the most obvious one we can think of: we have to do what we love and not let anyone stand in the way. We're also told about sticking together no matter what, since a band is essentially like a family. In this case, it's a family that doesn't want to ""grow up""; they want to eat, breathe, and sleep music without becoming corporate-run zombies that sit behind desks staring at computer screens. Fish suffered that fate for twenty years, making a living but not being alive. All he wanted was to have a good time, and he finds that passion once again helping his nephew's band. The movie itself shares that same passion for fun, which is a nice change from some of the raunchier immature comedies released over the past couple of months (""Step Brothers"" and ""Drillbit Taylor"" come to mind). ""The Rocker"" is funny without being excessive, and it actually tells us a story we can believe in. While it wasn't made as a drama, there are moments that are a bit more thoughtful in their approach. The fact that the filmmakers knew when to let the humor simmer down tells me they took their work seriously.",1219363200,18,5527,4.729253112033195
3547136,3,B001E95ZI8,"Though it borrows liberally from its genre brethren, The Rocker showcases a keen sense of parody and heart with a powerful star performance from the Jack Black-channeling Rainn Wilson. The ""naked drummer"" doesn't stray too far from his Office persona, but the random foul-mouthed spurts and goggle-eyed expressions certainly add a welcome layer of comic ingenuity.

In 1986, Robert ""Fish"" Fishman (Rainn Wilson) drums for the popular rock band Vesuvius and a lucrative career seems destined to embrace him. However, a chance to play at a killer gig causes his bandmates to sell him out for fast fame, and the drummer is literally kicked to the streets. Twenty years later, Robert finds himself in a dead-end desk job with no hope of escaping his mundane lifestyle. But good luck and misfortune strike simultaneously leaving him jobless, homeless, and shacked up at his sister's house - where the desperation of his nephew's rock band lands him a spot as their drummer. What starts off as a rocky, mismatched collaboration inadvertently becomes a rapid success and Robert, along with Amelia (Emma Stone), Curtis (Teddy Geiger), and Matt (Josh Gad) may finally get to live the dream they've worked so hard to obtain.

For his debut leading film role, Rainn Wilson manages a diverse blend of comedy and emanates the better qualities of funnyman Jack Black. Rainn keeps his character under control so as not to get annoying but remains erratic enough to evoke plenty of laughs. Most of the physical comedy (and nudity, unfortunately) belongs to the Office veteran who competently handles elaborate falls and crazed expressions with sincere enthusiasm. Spouting off random quotable gibes, Wilson utilizes a copious amount of offbeat one-liners and bizarre references that will result in a hearty chuckle for those attuned to the borderline-offensive brand of comedy.

While the primary band members fill their roles quite ably, a surprising amount of laughs come from the hilarious supporting characters and their moments of inspired lunacy. Most notable are Will Arnett as a crazed 80's rocker and Jason Sudeikis as an arrogant record label agent whose offensive pick-up lines never fail to amuse. Numerous cameos also fill the screen, from stand-up comedian favorites to famous musicians and anchored comedy character actors.

Though the whole cast turns in fine performances and Rainn Wilson conjures up a delirious beast of a drummer, The Rocker's downfall may be its heavily treaded subject matter. The clich-filled plot resembles far too many others and even the rather unique pieces feel drowned out by the surplus of stereotypical events. What clearly rocks though is the hysterical frontman and a host of great cameos and fantastic supporting characters who bring an edgy absurdity to the whole affair.

Although I am a big fan of 'The Office' I passed up this movie for the last few years thinking that I wouldn't enjoy it; not sure why - maybe it was the artwork or what that turned me off. Caught this by accident when channel surfing on Comedy Central and the next day ordered this Blu-ray from Amazon. Greatly enjoyed it! If I had to be critical about anything, it's this... the movie takes place in Cleveland and I live in Cleveland and I take issue with a few things; First, we do not call 'The Q' the 'Q Arena' (if you are a Cleveland vet you occasionally out of habit still call it the Gund Arena), Next, if you are on a tour bus and downtown can be seen out the driver's side windows (looking from the front of the bus to the back) you are obviously going west on Route 2 toward Edgewater Park and the bus driver pipes up and says, ""Rock Hall coming up on the left,"" then he is a liar, you would have already passed the Rock Hall and would have been on the right, if that isn't enough to question your bus driver then taking a left at the Rock Hall will because would have just drove the bus directly into Lake Erie, finally if you look out your bedroom window and see the Rock Hall, check to see if your two-story home has been built into the north side of a skyscraper.

1) Hang onto your youth for as long as you can (until you look completely silly doing so) and even then, stay young at heart if you can

2) If you dedicate yourself to something, you will ultimately have success (even if that doesn't manifest itself how you originally envisioned)

3547271,5,B001E95ZI8,"Ok, I admit it...I watched this film one day simply because I was bored and there was nothing better on.  In fact, the only thing that set it apart from the tv listings of the day.  In fact, the only reason I had settled on it was because (out of all the movies that barely had me interested), this one was music themed...and since I am a musician, it had at least that layer of interest.  I watched it...and now I bought it haha.  A comedic drama that, though certainly not terribly deep, it was nonetheless inspirational.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Ok, this movie definitely earns it's PG-13 rating.  Language-wise, it's not too terrible...but words like ""S----"" and  ""A--"" do pop up enough times to make mention of.  Surprisingly no F-bombs though.  Now, ""sexually"" this is a clean film in the sense that there is absolutely no ""love scenes"" (not even implied ""love scenes"" or anyone boasting about how they got laid)...even the venues they play in (some of them bars) don't feature any risque looking folks.  That said, there are some occasional verbal innuendos (mainly by their manager).  That said, most of the other characters are quite respectable and dignified.

PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
The plot is simple enough and has been done time and time again.  But it is still well crafted and emotionally engaging.  This film is one of the few films that I can say has near-perfect pacing.  I also loved the themes that they so naturally and eloquently implemented into the film.  Issues about maturity and growing up, about friendship and the danger of letting your anger out before getting the whole picture...The film definitely celebrates freedom and expression...but it also shows that being mature doesn't mean ceasing to have playful, dreamer, imaginative qualities.  It was awesome to see Fish overcome his past and become ""the better man"".  And I must say, you get totally emotionally involved and start rooting for the band along with the rest of the audience.  As to the comedy, this is one of the few comedic films that ever got me to laugh (not many do).  I think for me it's mainly because the humor is so simple and natural...yet witty and well timed.

CAST CHEMISTRY:
I don't usually mention this as long as the interaction between the cast was good...but I have to say I'm so impressed with this particular cast.  It amazed me how every character can be so distinctly unique from each other...while being so natural.  In fact, they really captured the variety of life so well.  And even though the characters had such distinct personas, they still felt like they were part of the same film.  And props to Rainn Wilson...I didn't even realize he was Dwight from ""The Office"" until I read some reviews and comments after watching the film...he was totally able to drop ""Dwight"" and become ""Fish"" with no hiccups at all.

MUSIC:
This is a music film...so I must put my thoughts down on the music.  The musical genre is very much the pop rock sound (with some 80s metal coming from Vesuvius).  But it is so well crafted with good lyric writing...it's simply attractive and catchy.  One of the few soundtracks that one could buy and just listen to on a car ride.

ALL IN ALL:
This film was such a gem!  Wonderful cast chemistry, simple but great humor, inspirational moments...and a generally good ""feel good"" film.  Personally, I could do without the ""pg-13"" elements, but they weren't so overbearing that the film is still tons of fun and enjoyable.",1410825600,,3463,4.748743718592965
3547272,5,B001E95ZI8,"The movie makes me wonder how many drummers were left behind when their band leaps to stardom.  I was a young teen when the Beatles first came to the States and remember reading that Ringo had been preceded by Pete Best--an event which British fans greeted with the jeer ""Pete forever, Ringo never!""  However, for Rain Wilson's character ""Fish"" no fan backlash marked the producer's push to replace him in the band ""Vesuvius"" with his nephew ""Sticks""!  Even Fish's superhuman chase of his erstwhile bandmates is to no avail.  The poor guy is left to labor at a call center for 20 years before the next chance at fame comes a calling--in the unlikely guise of his own nephew's Matt (played by Josh Gad) garage ban: ADD!

This film has a great cast, including Christina Applegate as the mom of ADD's brooding front man and song writer Curtis, played by actual musician and songwriter Teddy Geiger.  Emma Stone play's Amelia, the band's sullen bass guitar.  The members of Vesuvius: Lex, Kerr, Trash, and Sticks, are played by Will Arnett, Fred Armisen, Bradley Cooper, and Lonny Ross.  Jane Lynch takes the role of Fish's acerbic mother.  Jason Sudeikis is remarkably smarmy as ADD's ethically-challenged agent.

3547347,4,B001E95ZI8,"The reviews I read on this product before purchasing it said it was a really funny movie, and it is!  From the start, you can tell something is up and it's no holds barred hilarity from many cleverly (or not so cleverly) disguised stars of SNL!  The plot is reminiscent of ""School of Rock"", but takes the situation in a different direction, while amplifying the differences between past and present musical styles.  The movie features the parenting team of Jane Lynch and Jeff Garlin (from ""Sleepover"") and Christina Applegate really out of character as a somewhat overprotective mom.  The gags are sometimes cliche, but not always, and fairly enjoyable, except for the pocket of puke scene (blech).  Otherwise...

Rainn Wilson is very charming and endearing (not nearly as creepy as Dwight Schrute, his character from ""The Office"") as he portrays an aging 80's rocker who was NEARLY famous before being axed from his band at the height of their popularity.  Twenty years later, he is unexpectedly given another chance to rock and make a run for the top with his nephew and his band!  Will they succeed?  Will uncle get axed again?

The eighties are presented in an over the top, spirited set of individuals, which co mingles with a more cautious and controlled pop culture of the 90''s and 00's.

3547367,5,B001E95ZI8,"THE ROCKER has been berated by a number of reviewers, one of whom stated something to the effect that Rainn Wilson lacks the substance to carry off his lead role.  As a 40+-year rock veteran, I respectfully disagree.

OK.  So I disagree, and I'm NOT really respectful.  What do you want?  This is a fun film, meant to entertain, not to ride the red line on the raunch scale.  If you want a ""rocker education,"" read the book I'm writing on real rock road travel in the '70s and '80s.  Jack Kerouac couldn't cut it, folks.  By 1974, he'd have bailed out the side door of our red, unairconditioned Dodge Maxi-Van halfway between Memphis and Tunica, Mississippi, heading down Highway 61.  No Beat Generation road novel can capture what it was really like to wear the changes of the 1960s and gypsy your way through the '70s into position as ""Top Band at The Varsity Club, just off Cherry Street in Helena, Arkansas.""

But Fish gets it.  Wilson's performance in THE ROCKER embodies a sort of ""blood knowledge,"" if you'll pardon my quoting D. H. Lawrence, of a musician's paying dues with back-breaking work, too little sleep, way too much beer, and still loving it.  Trust me.  In the rock business, you never ""work at nothing all day.""

Spending years as a rock musician doesn't lead one to grow up, either.  My former band mates?  We Facebook.  We're all still ""Fish"" in one way or another.

As THE ROCKER, Wilson captures the essence of Fish--of all of us--and brings him to life.  Let's not forget: THE ROCKER is a comedy.  Never growing up?  That's more in the tragedy line, but THE ROCKER addresses this magical Peter Pan stance, which few of us rock vets ever lose.  We're all crazy, and Rainn Wilson renders that mostly harmless insanity into something that even I can laugh at.  As one of my former mates always said of us rockers, ""There's one good thing about being crazy.  You never have to worry about losing your mind!""  Fish is THERE.

My only complaint about the ""Born to Rock"" edition is its exclusion of the complete bit with Pete Best.  Those few seconds mean a great deal to rockers of my generation. I've seen the out-take, and I wish it were at least set up as an a bonus feature on this DVD.  Even without that option, THE ROCKER: ""Born to Rock Edition"" still earns its full five stars.

No, you won't find authentic rock word choice in this film.  You won't find the outrageous practical jokes bands play on each other just because they can.  THE ROCKER is not an X-rated venture into that world.  It's a comedy.  Remember the theatrical mask with the smile?

If you're so slick that you're too hip to sit back and have a laugh with THE ROCKER, you might benefit from knowing that not all the musical ""big fish"" (pun intended) are decent players, singers, or songwriters.  Thousands of bar bands blast some of these acts off the stage.  Sure, the business is a ""not what you do, but whom you know"" operation.  Then again, sometimes you're too good not to be noticed. These issues, too, are addressed in THE ROCKER.  Me?  I was ahead of my time.  Doesn't matter.  I'm still rocking.  I'm still kicking butt. I'll never grow up, and I'll never have to worry about losing my mind.

Yes, the real world, for real rockers, is ""soul-crushing.""  THE ROCKER lifts that weight, even if only for a little while. Every performer in THE ROCKER does his/her share of that lifting.  Let go and laugh.  You'll feel better.  And if you're not a rocker, Rainn Wilson offers you a thoroughly entertaining armchair roadtrip--no dues required.

3547368,3,B001E95ZI8,"Energetic and enthusiastic drummer Robert ""Fish"" Fishman (Rainn Wilson) is kicked out of the 80s rock band ""Vesuvius"" just before the other members make it big and enjoy huge success as rock star. Twenty years later still disgruntled Robert is seen working in office cubicle. When Robert loses the job, he is asked by his nephew Matt (Josh Gad) to play for his band's prom gig. As you will see, this turns out to be a good thing for Robert , Matt and other members of the band ""A.D.D."" - Curtis (Teddy Geiger) and Amelia (Emma Stone).

The introductory part of ""The Rocker"" is clearly inspired by the real-life story of Pete Best (who appears briefly at the bus stop scene), the drummer replaced by Ringo Starr just before the Beatles made their debut, but the storyline itself is similar to some of the recent rock-themed films such as ""The School of Rock"" and ""Rock Star."" This is a story you heard before, and it seems director Peter Cattaneo (""The Full Monty"") is aware of that. There are new ideas (the jam session on the net with the naked drummer and its consequences) and some of them are very good, sometimes hilarious, but they are not fully developed.

Even those who don't mind the predictability of the film might find the unlikely hero ""Fish"" a bit annoying. If you don't like Jack Black's character in ""School of Rock,"" you will probably don't find Rainn Wilson's character very attractive, who is ten times louder than Jack Black's wannabe rocker. Fans of Christina Applegate (as Curtis's mother and Robert's love interest) and Emma Stone would be disappointed with the underwritten characters they are required to play.

3547371,4,B001E95ZI8,"This is a great movie.  Fans of the Office will love Rainn.  He does a great job as a middle aged guy who isn't quite ready to work a real job and still has some unfinished business when it comes to playing music -- something I'm sure a lot of people will be able to relate to.  I think it does a good job of showing the excitment of putting a band together, when you think anything is possible, even though the fantasy is almost always better than the reality.  Funny cameo by Pete Best.

Music is actually pretty good.  If the metal songs had been released 20 years ago, they would have been hits.  Fun to look back on that stuff now that we don't take it so seriously.",1259452800,,671,4.115384615384615
3547372,4,B001E95ZI8,"Yes, drummers definitely march to the beat of their own drum (a fitting metaphor).  By and large they're anti-authority, eccentric, immature partay animals; but a good drummer can hold a band together like super glue.  And into this quirky realm enters Rainn Wilson as Robert Fishman (Fish)--the original drummer of legendary rock band Vesuvius, which summarily dumped him 20 years before as the band was entering its heyday.  Fish has a grudge, he detests normal things like. . .working. . .and he never wants to grow up.  So when his high school nephew (Josh Gad) appeals to Fish to bail out the nephew's band by playing the drums for the prom, Fish agrees, then readily gets bit by the rock 'n roll bug.  Subsequently a sight gag (not pleasant to watch) gets on YouTube, the band (named ADD) gets a following, then a sleazy agent (Jason Sudeikis), then goes on tour--and THE ROCKER takes off as a vehicle for Wilson's irreverent antics.

With a predictable plot and ADD's maddening bubblegum music and lyrics, I still got a hoot watching Wilson dominate scene after scene.  This guy really has a knack for physical comedy, and enough facial expressions to form his own area code.  He's often over the top, but it's needed to offset his surprisingly stoic and composed fellow band members (Gad, Teddy Geiger, Emma Stone), and a traveling band mom (Christina Applegate is gorgeous).  I really got a kick out of Will Arnett and Bradley Cooper playing self-absorbed, perpetually stoned, Vesuvius front men, and it's great to see Howard Hesseman still commanding a pulse.  Yet this is Rainn Wilson's baby, and THE ROCKER is grand fun to watch because of it.

Alright, you probably know what to expect- a bunch of teenagers (and one older man who's the main character) all get together to form a rock band.  They start performing at high school proms, get famous, have amazingly insane adventures along the way, and.... that's the main problem with the movie.  It was VERY predictable storyline-wise.

Everything that happens in real life to rock bands about how they start drinking heavily, doing drugs, getting chicks, and party the night away happens to the fictional band in this movie.  It's nothing new- you KNOW exactly what to expect.  It's been done before in other movies (such as that one Jack Black one about the guitar) and it's been done in real life thousands of times across the world.

At least some of the acting was decent, some of the jokes were pretty good, and the story was told nicely with a heavy focus on the fact that the oldest member of the band was 20 years older than the other band members (and how he got kicked out of his previous band 20 years before).  Other than that I have nothing else to say about a movie you know by heart without even having to watch it.",1250380800,,1341,4.5041322314049586

Overall, it seemed like a combination of parts of Rock Star and School Of Rock with elements of other rock n roll movies in there.
The movie is watchable, but I would rank the other two movies I mentioned higher then this one. What would have made it better was a decent soundtrack, these songs this group put together just plain and simple suck because it's more alternative music then real rock n roll.",1246320000,,1151,4.184684684684685
3547375,4,B001E95ZI8,"The Rocker speaks to all those who want to live out their rock `n' roll dream of making it big, and playing in front of a huge crowd. At times you get a sense where the film is heading, and can predict some parts, especially towards the end, but it is a very engaging and light-hearted comedy about fame, loyalty, and, of course, rock. What was refreshing was that there wasn't an overabundance of profanity or crudeness in a film that could have easily gone that route; instead, the film's comedy relies more on great lines from its main character ""Fish"" and parody-like situations with the band. Comparisons between The Rocker and School of Rock seem to abound in the reviews, and Rainn Wilson seems to bring the same energy to this role as Jack Black did in School of Rock, but I thought this was the better of the two films.

The film's premise: After Vesuvius' show before a Cleveland crowd in 1986, the band decides to drop drummer Robert Fishman (""Fish"") in hopes of their shot at big-time fame. Twenty years later, Fish is spurned by Vesuvius' popularity and fame as one of the greatest bands ever, and bitterly contemplates what could have been as he works in his cubicle while coworkers listen to Vesuvius. After being fired, Fish's nephew offers him a chance to play with them in a school prom, and Fish begins to realize that this might be his new-found chance at realizing his long lost dreams. His new band, A.D.D., begins to make waves in the music scene after sudden YouTube fame, and with their scumbag hipster agent (played by Saturday Night Live's Jason Sudeikis) they make their way up to the top and the eventual chance to play in front of a Cleveland crowd. However, there is a catch to this opportunity for Fish. He has a big dilemma: does he choose his pride, or loyalty?

Overall, this is quite an enjoyable and funny film. There are some laugh out loud scenes, and the casting for the various roles is fantastic. It is funny enough to be engaging, yet not too over the top to make one disgusted. Among other stars in the film are Christina Appelgate as one of the band member's moms and Saturday Night Live's Fred Armisen as one of the members of Vesuvius. Rainn Wilson really brings an exceptional amount of humor to his role. Another great aspect of this comedy is that you seem to care, and root, for the main character along the way.

Fish spends the next twenty years working 9 to 5 and brooding over his bandmates' betrayal. He never touches a drum kit again until his teenaged nephew, in a band called Attention Deficit Disorder, begs him to fill in for the band's absent drummer.

Fish agrees. He gives the lead singer, Timothy Geiger, a few new arrangements and some lyrics, and within months, A.D.D. is the biggest act around with a hit record and a national tour. Although Fish quickly readopts his hardcore rocker lifestyle, his young bandmates act as a sea anchor, calming him somewhat.

All is well until the band's manager convinces Geiger to dump ""the dinosaur,"" and Fish finds himself once again relegated to the bargain bin. But A.D.D. is not Vesuvius, and they quickly lose momentum without their sparkplug. Although begged to return, at first Fish is embittered, especially when he discovers that A.D.D. is to be the opening act for Vesuvius's world tour.

3547381,5,B001E95ZI8,"i keep seeing these reviews and remarks that The Rocker is a rip off of Jack Black's The School of Rock.

expect for a line or part here or there, The Rocker stands on it's own merit and is completely awesome, just like The School of Rock.

Robert Fishman, aka FISH was the drummer for the band Vesuvius before they hit legendary status. When the manager asks the band to fire Fish and replace him with the Producer's nephew and get the big contract, they oblige and Fish is out.

20 years later, Vesiuvus is the biggest band in America and Fish is bouncing from job to job feeling sorry for himself that he could have and should have been the drummer for Vesuvius, even naming a couple of their songs before they hit big.

He's fired from his current job after getting into a fight with a co-worker who puts on the newest CD of Vesivus, which Fish doesn't want to hear.

He dumps, or rather, is dumped by his girlfriend so he moves in with his sister, played by Jane Lynch (Role Models, 40 Year Old Virgin). His nephew Matt is in a band called A.D.D., and they are scheduled to play at the upcoming prom. The band includes signer-songwriter Curtis (Teddy Gieger who actually is a real life musician) and gutiarist Amelia (Emma Stone,  Jules from Superbad). Their drummer is suspended from school, can't walk the graduation line, and is grounded by his mother, so the hunt begins for a new drummer.

With all options exhausted, they ask Uncle Fish, and he agrees to play drums at the Prom after a heart to heart with his nephew Matt. He shows up rock star style with backstage passes and without ever practicing, rocks the drums and band starts off awesome, but during the king-queen song, Fish gets overexcited being that it was the first time he had played drums or in a concert in over 20 years, and flies off on a drum solo during a slow dance and ruins the band's performance.

Feeling bad, he meets with the band a couple of days later and tells them that they are good and that their songs need to be heard, so he proposes a deal to get the band a gig with himself as the lead drummer.

Fish gets the gig, but in Indiana (the story takes place in Cleveland), so the kids cop up a fake story and Fish ""borrows"" his sister's car, she calls the cops, the kids get grounded, and Fish gets kicked out of his sister's house.

She keeps asking him to grow up, but as he says, ""you can never take away the dream"".

The band continues to practice, as Matt is good with computers and sets up 4 different webcams so they can continue to all practice despite being all grounded, but Fish, being old school, thinks the camera is a microphone and plays the drums completely naked!

Matt's sister sees the video and puts it on Youtube and BANG........Internet sensation.

They get signed to a contract and start touring, and i don't want to give away the story, but it's awesome, really enjoyable.

Christina Applegate (Curtis' Mom) and SNL's Jason Sudeikis (plays Joe Biden on SNL) also come out the movie with Jason playing the role of David Marshall, the band's manager. It's hilarious watching Jason's character trying to hit on Christina Applegate, and his lines are funny, like ""yeah well, your body's changing."" LOL!!! ;) (inside joke-you need to watch the movie to understand). My favorite line was the John Lennon line.

Great movie overall, the soundtrack is awsome, Rainn Wilson is AWESOME and his drum playing is authentic. What makes the movie even better is the authenticity of the music, because Teddy Geiger, who plays Curtis is actually singing the song, and the 2 Vesivus songs that come out in the movie also come out on the soundtrack.

I know The Rocker didn't do so hot in the theaters, but I really liked this movie. it's very original (based in part on the story of Pete Best, original drummer of The Beatles before they fired him and before the Beatles hit it big. Best BTW, was replaced by Ringo Starr.

but overall, great movie, great songs, great comedy, good clean Rock movie.",1237420800,6,3997,4.5062240663900415
3547382,4,B001E95ZI8,"""Dwight"" from The Office fans should find enough Dwight in this film to satisfy. Those of you who can't stand ""Dwight"" well, you may not find The Rocker experience a great one. The story is amusing enough. Twenty years previously, Fish (Wilson) is the drummer for the band Vesuvius. Good news for the band, a big label wants to sign them. Bad news for Fish, the president of the label has a drummer nephew who will be the band drummer. Fish never gets over this slight. As the band Vesuvius grows in popularity, Fish grows in bitterness. After losing his job, girlfriend and apartment he moves into his sister's attic. His nephew has a garage band with a gig at the prom. They lose their drummer and, well, you can figure it out from here.

Surprisingly clean, there are no sex scenes, the language is tolerable and low-key. However, there is a scene with an angry mother who shares the fact that her son drew a male body part on a female teacher's face....which is a very funny scene, but contains the anatomically correct word several times. There is also a band manager who is very free with come-on's and has a sexually oriented potty mouth. A scene of Fish drumming naked becomes the YouTube hit -- The Naked Drummer -- and propels the band to popularity. Viewers are treated to a whole lot of naked man rear shots.

The humor level is moderate. Like I said, you probably need to be amused by Dwight to fully appreciate Fish's humor. He has a very unique delivery, sweet blended with doofusy sarcasm/nastiness. There are several amusing one-liners and situations that are laugh out loud including quite a bit of physical humor. Christina Applegate delivers some great sarcastic lines. The writing is good. The songs are easy to listen to and I really liked their sound. Solid friendship, do-the-right thing and forgiveness themes run through the film. Fish is a classic 80's rocker who likes the party scene, including the trashing of hotel rooms. The three younger band members are annoyed with his boorish behavior and that's a nice refreshing change from the usual teen movie.",1236384000,8,2084,4.722527472527473

3547387,4,B001E95ZI8,"Maybe it was the reviews, or those horrid ads, but somehow I figured this movie was going to be terrible, and gave it 15 minutes. But against all expectations, not only did I get through the movie, but it was pretty good. Granted, it is a bit formulamatic, predictable, and some of the jokes fell flat, but it succeeded where you'd least expect. In fact, it was sweet, engaging, it did have some great jokes, but also good performances and a soundtrack that anchors it all.

It mostly rides on the concept of missing out on your dream by *this* much, leaving you with only a bunch of 'what-ifs.' In this case, it's a rocker who missed his chance on being part of one of the biggest groups in the world. A deleted scene with former-Beatle Pete Best anchors in this fact, and the concept actually is quite interesting in of itself. Add to that themes of moving on, maturity, and following your dreams, and you're hooked.

Another thing that is surprising is characterization, as you see this motley crew who make up a band develop and mature through their journey on the road to stardom. Rainn Wilson, Emma Stone and even Christina Applegate are great in their roles, and bring something extra to their characters that probably wouldn't have been there otherwise. Teddy Geiger is also a good actor, playing an emoish kid who through his journey develops into a sunny pop/rock artist. And this is where the soundtrack comes in, because even though it doesn't sound all that great by itself, it sounds pretty impressive within the movie.

Overall, you should at least check it out as a rental, and come into the movie with an open mind. You might just like what you hear and see in this underrated flick.

3547404,4,B001E95ZI8,"Argh! Curse you 20th Century FOX for your pricing structure.  I'd rate this film a buy-it in a heartbeat if the price was about 30 percent lower than it is (yes, I know that Amazon keeps their Blu-rays on sale regularly, so it's already discounted... what I am wishing is that the MSRP was lower so that Amazon's price could be lowered in which case I'd probably buy this without even pausing).  Thanks to the higher MSRP I'm left to say this one is at least worth a rental, but probably would have to be on sale to really pull the buy it rating.

No, there's nothing wrong with the film in my book, in fact it's a pretty likable and entertaining comedy.  While critics gave the film a mixed reception (39 percent rotten), there've been plenty of films that are worse and which fail to deliver anything close to the entertainment value found here.

The Rocker features a fairly talented cast that seem to fit the roles they were in, though star Rainn Wilson (The Office, Six Feet Under, others) and his bandmates don't necessarily look that young at the start of the film (20 years ago), and don't necessarily seem all that old so much later in the film either.

So here's the story, in case you are not familiar with The Rocker: an up-and-coming rock band is about to hit it big, with the record company scout in the audience as they are playing to a packed house.  As the show wraps up the record company exec comes in and sends the band's drummer out to go get some beer.  Not just any beer, but the good stuff.  Imported even.  The band knows that must mean good news, and yes, it really does, though not for everyone in the band.  It seems that the record company president has a relative that wants to be a rockstar who just happens to play the drums.  You'd have to blind not to see where things are going there...

Flash forward 20 years to find that former drummer Robert 'Fish' Fishman (Wilson) can't seem to escape the loss of his chance at fame and rockstar fortune.  One of his cubicle mates has purchased the latest CD from his old band and forces Fish (and the rest of the office) to give it a listen.  Needless to say Fish isn't particularly pleased by that idea :-/

Fish winds up out of work, tossed out by his girlfriend and with no where to go but to his sister's house.  There he renews acquaintances with his nephew Matt Gadman (Josh Gad, formerly in FOX's short-lived TV series Back to You) and Matt's parents (Jeff Garlin of Curb Your Enthusiasm and others along with Jane Lynch of The L Word, The 40 Year Virgin and others).  It seems that Matt is in a band with a few of his high school friends: Curtis (Teddy Geiger, formerly on the CBS series Love Monkey), Amelia (Emma Stone of FOX's short-lived series Drive and others) along with a drummer that finds himself grounded for a few pranks he's pulled at school.

The band has already been booked to play the prom, so as a favor Fish joins the band and takes up the role of drummer.  Sensing how talented Curtis is, and perhaps sensing another shot at the rockstar life, Fish promises to get a gig for the band and winds up doing just that.  Soon, through a happy accident involving You Tube, Fish has done more than just get a gig for the band, he's gotten them interest from a record label that wants to send the band on the road.

The rocker doesn't always hit all of the notes it aims for, but more often than not it delivers fairly solid entertainment value for viewers.  Fish gets to have some of the fun that he missed out on while his old band was working their way to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Unfortunately some of that fun is a little too much for the parents of the band mates to live with, so Curtis mother Kim (Christina Applegate) becomes a chaperon on the tour.

Be sure to look for a few cameos and small roles by a few notable individuals and also enjoy the short performances by Fish's old band mates, at least one of which was barely recognizable until well into his appearance.

Making the film a bit more enjoyable is a solid sound track with an enjoyable collection of rock anthems along with 'original music' from A.D.D. (the kids band).

Video quality is quite solid, and looks quite nice for the concert type footage.  There's some nice shots of the Cleveland cityscape included too.  With the film being a recent release, the source material is all clean and was obviously ready for transfer to high-definition disc format.

In addition to other bonus features, the Blu-ray includes Digital Copy, though again the price for purchase is still higher than I'd prefer.",1233100800,,4575,4.424821002386635
3547405,4,B001E95ZI8,"You look at that DVD cover and you assume you're just gonna get something like all the other teen junk out there with stupid sophmoric humor that is poorly executed and shamelessly tries to get as crude as possible in order to draw attention to itself.

Yet, the ROCKER gives me hope that good cinema still exists. It isn't outstanding and it isn't slam bam laugh out loud every two seconds but what the ROCKER does, is something that USED to be done all the time in movies. It has CHARACTER and HEART and PERSONALITY and a MESSAGE to say about living your dreams and not letting anything knock you off course.

Most importantly though, the ROCKER locks you into the characters and you care about them, you are involved and invested in their stories. You have a connection with them, and sadly, that is something that most films these days... forget.

The ROCKER does ROCK because it had the balls to be REAL, HONEST and FUNNY at the same time, in a hollywood environment that caters to the sophmoric crude and trashy humor that we get most of the time. It banked on the personalities in the script and banked that the audience would relate and they did and will.",1233014400,,1163,4.502369668246446
3547406,4,B001E95ZI8,"THE ROCKER releases this week and offers a world where dreams come true. Passed over when it was released, never making the ranks of quality films for most critics, it offers nothing less than what most viewers are looking for. Pure entertainment, fun and a chance to escape the mundane world we all live in. Unfortunately, that is not what most critics look for in a movie. Their loss.

Rainn Wilson of TV's THE OFFICE stars as Robert ""Fish"" Fishman, the drummer for heavy metal hair band Vesuvius as the film opens in 1988. The band has just been offered the big time if they will only dump their wild man drummer. The temptation is too great and after a hilarious dumping, the band heads to the big time and Fish heads to 20 years of drudgery.

After losing his job, getting dropped by his girlfriend and having to endure the success of his former band mates, Fish retires to his sister's home until he can find work. His high school age nephew Matt (Josh Gad) plays in a band of his own with several friends called A.D.D.  When their drummer gets suspended and grounded, they find themselves in need of a drummer. Unable to find one on short notice, they elect Fish.

All doesn't go well but eventually they begin working together. Songwriter-singer Curtis (Teddy Geiger) comes up with dynamite lyrics that Fish finds amazing. Bass player and attitude champion Amelia (Emma Stone) broods and pines for Curtis but never lets on. Matt dreams of losing his insecurity and meeting a girl. Things would be back to normal with the exception that Matt's brat sister puts in motion a video that will change their lives.

Matt has a 4 way online video conference hook up allowing the band to practice at home in their rooms. Non-tech savvy Fish practices in the buff and once the video hits online, The Naked Drummer gets tons of hits as well as the attention of a record company.

With the offer to record and then tour, things seem to be going great for both the band and Fish. The band because a young, fresh sound gets the chance to be heard. Fish because he now has a second chance to make his dream come true.

But that dream comes with a price. Still trapped in his youthful ideas of the rock and roll lifestyle, Fish attempts to get the kids to be the bad boys (and girl) of rock. But they just want to relax and play X Box after a gig. A few weeks on the road and the bands parents are required to bail them out of jail led by Curtis' mom Kim (Christina Applegate). The only way they will allow the tour to continue is if she goes along as well. Hello mom.

A smarmy record exec tries to put members of the band against one another, tries to shape them into something they are not and in general screws things up between this extended family. The result is Fish dumping the rocker lifestyle, cutting his hair and taking a responsible job. The band suffers with his loss. And eventually they come around to bringing him back in the fold.

The only problem is that as popular as they've become, their next big opportunity is to open up for Vesuvius at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can Fish put aside his grievances with the old band? Can A.D.D. remain on top? Watch and see!

There are a lot of clichs in this film. The characters are pat ones. Wilson does a goofball like most actors these days resulting to gross out humor. But it doesn't matter! The film plays for laughs, for fun, for entertainment. Along the way Wilson's character adopts a fatherly attitude towards Curtis, offering great advice he never seems to be able to apply to himself. It makes Fish seem not only the wild man but an endearing soul as well.

This is by no means a movie to make others pale in comparison. It is not a classic that will be treasured forever. Oddly enough, I don't think anyone involved ever intended it to be so. So why do critics, written and couch bound alike, choose to hurl insults and disgust at it? Because its not art. Tough luck. Rather than seek art in a film like this, sit back and enjoy the moment. Who knows, you might end up having a good time.",1232841600,,4058,4.397333333333333

the plot

Back in 1988, drummer Robert Fishman, known to his fans as Fish is about to hit it big with his local Cleveland, Hair-Metal band Vesuvius.  In fact we witness the fateful night for this talented band when they are signed to Matchbook Records but on one condition.  The president of Matchbook Records wants to give his nephew a big break as well, so he would have to replace Fish as drummer in the band.  The rest of Vesuvius was pretty easy to persuade as their manager waved the record contract in the faces.

Now it's twenty years later, and Fish is going through the motions at his humdrum job, while Vesuvius has risen to amazing musical heights, and on their first eligible year to be eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, they make it in.  Fish hates hearing about his old band, and he kind of freaks out and breaks things when he is forced to hear their music.  In fact he did this at his job, and when he was fired he had to move in with his sister and her family.  Her son Matt is the keyboardist in his high-school band A.D.D., and when their drummer cannot make the gig, they use Fish to play the gig at the prom.

Because of the buzz Fish got from playing drums again, he asks to be a permanent part of A.D.D., and he starts getting the band gigs.  After trying to sneak out with Matt to their first gig, and ""borrowing"" his sister's minivan, she calls the police and the band get arrested for stealing the car.  Now that they're punished and Fish is kicked out of the house, Matt devises a plan where they could all still practice via video cameras connected through the computer.  Since Fish is staying in the basement of a Chinese restaurant, the heat gets unbearable, so he is often very scantily clad.  On the day of their first practice, he does it in the buff, and Matt's little sister sees the naked drummer and puts the video on YouTube.

The video gets millions of hits and although the people are laughing, they are also grooving to the tunes of A.D.D.  The band gets signed to Matchbook Records, and start touring America's mid-west.  The band starts enjoying success, fame and the road in general.  The sleazy manager they acquire from Matchbook Records tries to put wedges between members of the band, and the strain is now showing on the band.  Can A.D.D. overcome the obstacles put in play by their manager?  Can Fish handle being an 80s rock star in today's business?  Find out when you buy The Rockeron blu-ray or DVD!

the breakdown

I do not like The Office (on NBC), so I pretty much ignored The Rocker since it's release.  But there are days when you are just in the mood to laugh, or as it usually goes - laugh some more.  That's what I wanted, since I just caught most of one of my favorite new flicks on my FIOS TV, (Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist), my own laugh was infectious to myself, so I looked for another comedy.  I came across this gem hidden within the thousands of On Demand available free movies.  Now, I'm not sure which flick I like better, The Rocker or Nick and Nora.

After watching the movie, and although I'm not into The Office, I remembered how much I enjoyed Rainn Wilson's character from the HBO series Six Feet Under.  This guy is seriously funny, and he was uproarious here in this movie.  I am so used to seeing Rainn in these types of straitlaced but quirky and oddly humorous characters like the ones I mentioned above, that it didn't register with me immediately that his out-of-control, edgy, wild Fish character was played by Wilson.  He seemed more like one of the SNL characters (Will Arnett, Fred Armisen) who made up the rest of Vesuvius.

Rainn had an awesome supporting cast around him as well.  Emma Stone, who plays bass player Amelia, had these great moments that had me cracking up.  My favorite was when Fish comes on the webcam nude and she starts her ""yuck"" noises, but then she seems even more mystified why the other two members of the band are not reacting to Rainn's bare bottom; (""Hello?  Am I the only one seeing this?  Why isn't anyone reacting?"")  I may not watch The Office, but I am a big fan of Numb3rs, and on a couple of episodes there was this hysterical nerdy guy played by Josh Gad.  Gad is slightly reminiscent of Jonah Hill (Superbad) because of his curly hair and weight, but his approach is much more quiet and subtle.

I wasn't familiar with Teddy Geiger, but he embodied the broody, loner singer songwriter Curtis perfectly.  His mother was played by Christina Applegate, who looks the best I've seen her in years.  Jane Lynch (40 Year Old Virgin) played Fish's sister Lisa.  Lynch is usually very funny in her comedy roles, but here she is the 'rain on the parade', party-pooper and she effectively ticks off the viewer, while at the same time we understand her many gripes.

The sets looked great whether it was the tour bus, the hotel rooms, the Chinese restaurant basement and even the venues where the bands played.  For the parents, there is good reason why this is rated PG-13, although there are no F-bombs thankfully.  The nudity in the film is Rainn's naked backside.  There is some crude sex talk, but for the most part will go over the kids' heads.  Personally I don't mind the drug references in most films, it gives me a chance to discuss how stupid alcohol and drugs makes people, and the movie always backs up my speech to my eight year old.

Bit of trivia also, there's a scene near the beginning of the film when Rainn Wilson's character is seated at a bus stop next to an older guy.  Almost as an inside joke for Beatles fans, it turns out that Fish is sitting next to Pete Best, the drummer booted from The Beatles in order to make way for Ringo Starr.  Kudos for Mr. Best for having such a scene of humor.

I recommend this film for families with kids around ten years old or older; it's a fantastic comedy that most will enjoy.  I can guarantee that you'll laugh until you wet your pants.  Well, maybe not wet your pants, but you'll laugh.
