With this one, once again the package labeled NTSC (via a small white sticker on label over PAL -- cannot see until remove shrink wrap). This time I gingerly peeled back the sticker, and lo and behold, once again it said PAL. Did not even bother to open the shrink wrapping. Just sent it back.",1441324800,,335,4.25

8046427,4,B0007A103E,"""Power & Distance II with Mark Eldridge"", part of the Elite Video Series, has a ton of good information in it, particularly in the first half of the video.  In this video, Coach Eldridge goes over some advanced techniques and drills to help batters become more productive at the plate.  The video has three parts to it:

1) Preparations while in the batter's box,
2) The sequence of a good swing, and
3) Batting drills

The best part of the video is the first twenty minutes or so which goes into a lot of detail about what a batter should do while the pitcher is off the rubber well before the pitch arrives.  Coach Eldridge points out the importance of being relaxed in the box, and suggests some mental and physical routines to help the batter stay relaxed.  In addition, he points out specific cues that the batter can work on to make sure that she is in a good stance going into the swing.  Such ""Aha!"" moments for me included having the weight of the batter's back foot on her toe with her heel very slightly off the ground, and the fact that a wider stance actually leads to a quicker swing.

If one teaches a linear style of hitting, then I'm sure that the rest of the video has a bunch of good teaching points.  Unfortunately, I teach more of a rotational style of hitting, so a lot of the rest of the video really did not apply to what I do on the practice field.  I did find it interesting that, as a linear coach, he emphasized driving the hips to power the swing just as a rotational swing would do.  A linear swing apparently generates hip rotation by driving from the back foot, whereas a rotational swing triggers hip power via the front foot.

Still, there was so much good information in the first part of the video that any coach would benefit by watching it.  It reminded me that, as a coach, I should not take the basics and the details for granted - players have to learn them, just as I must have way back when dinosaurs roamed the earth.  Paying attention to detail can be the difference between success and failure when hitting.  I likely would have given this DVD 5 stars if rotational hitting had been reviewed instead of linear.",1276732800,2,2156,4.381909547738694

8046429,5,B0007A103E,"I have not had the chance to view these DVDs yet, but I will go so far as to say that both Master Froes and Master Carvalho are both top-notch instructors of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu - and that it would be worth purchasing these instructional videos.  Both instructors have over 20 years each of experience in this martial art, and both have been inducted into the Martial Arts Masters Hall Of Fame for their extensive work with children.  If you're interested in martial arts, mixed martial arts, grappling, self-defense, and/or a great way to get in shape - buy these videos. If you're ever in Costa Mesa, California, please look them up at Global Jiu-Jitsu Academy. Honest instructors and honest self defense techniques!",1106784000,2,718,4.877049180327869
