631736,5,6303328199,"Lighthearted comedy, with wonderful singing by Deanna.  The way Bob Cummings starts to fall in love with her when she sings, is a favorite part of mine. The lighting, the enormous bed Charles Laughlin is in, the part  when Bob Cummings is saying how he will find a new girl ""sooner than I  think"", all tiny points, but put together to make one grand movie.",945216000,2,356,4.446153846153846

631821,5,6303328199,I don't know how I missed knowing about Deanna Durbin's voice or her films.  A fabulous operatic voice (she was one of the inspirations for some of today's Met Opera stars).  Movie is excellent and the supporting cast is top notch.  I was so impressed that I ordered four more of her films and three of her vocal CDs.  Get this DVD - you will enjoy it.,1393545600,,352,4.208955223880597

631824,4,6303328199,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

How did I miss the talent of Deanna after all these years, I swore it was not her actually singing in this film it was so highly professional and exceptionally beautiful! My dear grandfather admitted this was his favorite actress and was always curious as to why...

At first glance she does not appear to be your typical Hollywood beauty, so natural, youthful, and unsophisticated. Then you see her interact with the immense talent that is Charles Lawton and a few songs and one crazy dance later you are mesmerized.

How sorry I am not to have followed-up on grandfathers declaration over half a century ago, but hopefully she had a long, fulfilling life and I have finally had the opportunity to appreciate her lovely talents.

High recommend for a voice better than Judy's!!",1389657600,,820,4.794326241134752

her fascinating to watch. Her voice is remarkable. Followed her  from her

631872,5,6303328199,"good though I'd rather be rich is better. You'd have to find it online or pay for it but ""Goulet and Williams beat her out but they are not sapranos either.",1361750400,,156,4.064516129032258
631873,5,6303328199,"When a man (Robert Cummings) visits his dying father (Charles Laughton), he is requested to bring his fiance for his father to meet for the first time before he passes away. The man is beside himself because he cannot find Gloria, his fiance, who went out shopping with her mother. Instead, he pays a girl (Deanna Durbin) who works at the hotel to pose as his fiance for the night, since his father will never know the difference. She takes the job so that she can go visit her family in Ohio with the money. However, the girl's wholesome looks and vibrant personality charm the old man and he makes a full recovery, leaving the man with an interesting situation.

This film is very funny throughout. The charade is the most obviously humorous part, but other minor parts evoke laughter as well. The newspapermen are funny, Laughton's desire for a cigar is funny, and Durbin's tenacity when it comes to music is funny.

Durbin is outstanding in this film. She is realistic and mature, making her character quite believable despite the hair-brained situation. It makes it easy to understand why the old man would like her so much. She is sweet and sincere, a ""good girl,"" but by no means an annoying one. She is also playful and likeably heartbreaking at times.

Laughton is almost unrecognizable at times in his old man makeup. He plays the amusing sick man to the hilt in a way reminiscent of Lionel Barrymore. He is subtlety cute and funny at the same time, and obviously very sensitive but honest underneath the playful exterior.

Cummings has good chemistry with Durbin and is effective in his emotional scenes. However, he takes a backseat to the other stars.

The music in Durbin's films is almost as important as the story. She sings three in this film. The first is ""When I Sing"" which sounds startlingly familiar to the ""Once Upon a Dream"" song from Sleeping Beauty. The process of preparing for the song is quite funny. The second song is a jumpy Spanish number. It shows off Durbin's many talents including that of vocal, piano, and energetic presence. The last song is ""Goin' Home,"" a dreamy weepy song that has too obviously been dubbed.

Overall, this film is delightful, and although the music is adequate, it is not wonderful. For those who are not a fan of Durbin's operatic voice, this could be a positive aspect of the film, but for those who cherish it, it might be a bit disappointing.",1132358400,,2406,4.662735849056604
631874,4,6303328199,"It Started With Eve is a comedy drama with an original situation, kept interesting by great performances.  Charles Laughton is a wealthy old man who demands to meet his son's fiancee from his deathbed.  He's expected to expire within hours, but his son (Robert Cummings) can't locate his fiancee, who's gone out with her mother.  He wants the old man to die happy, so in an act of desperation he hires a hat check girl (Deanna Durbin) to pose as his fiancee.  He introduces her to his father, and everthing seems to go off well - until the next moring, when the old man not only doesn't die, but asks to see the girl again.  The deception continues as he makes a speedy recovery.  Laughton is great fun to watch, Durbin beautiful to listen to (she sings 3 songs), and Cummings and the rest of the cast provide competent performances to make the movie work. It's not quite as funny as it might have been, but still a treat to watch throughout.",1118275200,,942,4.4476744186046515
631875,5,6303328199,"Deanna Durbin was always fabulous and on this outing has a nice script and fine support from Charles Laughton and Robert Cummings, making this one of her best. This film is warm, funny and delightful. Durban even gets to do a few beautiful songs that are worked into the story in a natural way. This is really a very funny comedy with many fine moments that will leave you smiling when it's over.

Jonathan Reynolds (Charles Laughton), an irracible, rich and socially prominent tycoon, is on his death bed. His son Jonathan Jr. (Robert Cummings) rushes home from Mexico with his new fiance Gloria (Margaret Tallichet) to see him before he dies, an event the papers can't wait for. But when the old man wants to meet young Jonathan's bride to be, she and her hideous mother have left the hotel to go shopping. A desparate Jonathan  talks coat check girl Anne Terry (Deanna Durbin) into pretending to be Gloria for $50.00. It is money she needs for train fare back to Shelbyville because she is abandoning her dreams of singing stardom, which are going nowhere.

A teary eyed Anne has a warm and instant connection with old man Jonathan, who adores her and makes an unexpected recovery thanks to her charm and warmth. This causes complications for Jonathan, who has to catch Anne at the train station twice in order to keep the charade going! The interplay between the two as they start bickering about it is priceless. Even when the old man overhears them and knows the truth he goes along because he can see she's the right girl for his son Jonathan Jr., and the daughter-in-law he wants.

Of course, Jonathan Jr. still thinks he wants to marry the real Gloria and there is a subplot about a party which will be attended by Stokowski and Heifetz, friends of the old man. Anne may finally get her chance to be noticed. But she is too sweet to go through with it and plans on returning home to Shelbyville, prompting the wise old Jonathan to hatch up a little plan of his own.

 A night on the town where a delightful Durbin teaches Laughton to do the Conga in a swank nightclub is a particular highlight of this stellar film. Deanna's tearful rendition of ""Goin' Home"" is another. There is also an hilarious fight scene with Durbin and Cummings chasing each other all over the place that involves biting and pinching which will surely leave you on the floor!

This is one of Durbin's best films. She had a flair for light comedy and a warmth and sincerity to her acting. You can't miss this one if you love Durbin or enjoy a great comedy. This is a classy production and a chance to see for yourself the always wonderful Deanna Durbin, always and forever, ""The Last Rose of Summer.""",1112918400,11,2681,4.549792531120332
631876,5,6303328199,HIGHLY recommend for all Deanna Durbin fans to watch this wonderful romantic movie.,990403200,,83,5.461538461538462
631877,3,6303328199,"Her first movie where consummation (i.e., marriage) becomes a possibility.  Durbin, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, has a knack for facetious comic timing as well, the heavy-lidded, seen-it-all variety that Rosalind Russell and Barbara Stanwyck mastered.  Charles Laughton tries a little too hard to be a crinkly, charming old tycoon, but he pulls it off pretty well.  This late screwball comedy features the handsome pratfall Robert Cummings, but the chemistry the movie presumes to show between him and Durbin seems a little superficial if not non-existent (other than the nearly kinky pinching scene, of course).  Fun and diverting overall.",985564800,,641,5.577319587628866
631878,4,6303328199,"I love this film!  I can't say it better than that - it's my favourite of all Deanna Durbin movies and is an absolute delight from start to finish.
When Cummings thinks his father (Laughton) is dying he needs to bring his fiancee to meet him before it's too late.  Unfortunately, he can't reach her at her hotel and so grabs the first woman he sees (Durbin) and brings her along instead.
The father likes her immediately and takes a turn for the better - Cummings is now stuck with a fake fiancee and he can't tell his father in case the shock kills him.  But then there's another twist in the tale when the father overhears them talking and finds out about the ruse but likes her so much that he wants his son to be with her instead of his real fiancee.
Durbin is excellent as the poor woman caught in the middle of everything, torn between doing the right thing and carrying on the ruse.  At the same time she comes to care for the old man and falls in love with the son which gives her even more problems to deal with.
A great sparkling comedy that still allows Durbin to sing some fabulous songs.  I defy anyone not to have a tear in their eye when she sings, There's No Place Like Home.'
The chemistry between the two leads is wonderful and I just wish they had made more films together.  For a nice romantic musical, this is hard to top.",976752000,8,1343,4.2265625
631879,4,6303328199,"Deanna Durbin!  It took 10 movies, all big moneymakers, to work her and her captious fans cautiously up to this little offering; which is considered one of her best.  Cummings brings Deanna to meet his Dad (Charles Laughton) but only as a last minute replacement because his real finacee is unavailable (it is thought that Pop is dying and Bobby will inherit millions of $$). As it turns out old Pop regains his health plus he's taken a real shining to imposter Deanna! Cute and charming with Laughton giving a delightful performance full of feeling, and his timing is impeccable.  Until her marriage on April 18, 1941, Durbin played only demure or saucy little girls who, rarely, in a daring moment, go a chaste little puppy-love peck on the cheek.  But now that she was Ms. Vaughan Paul, wife of a Hollywood producer, she stepped out in IT HAPPENED WITH EVE as a full-grown cinema siren, capable of biting, kissing or slapping her man around.  The only child star who weathered the awkward age (unlike Shirley Temple) without once faltering at the box-office, Durbin enchanted audiences with her pretty face, graceful figure and a voice as radiant as a clear Spring morning.  A big share of this film's merry quality is due to the expert acting of Charles Laughton.  His crusty 75-year-old tycoon, revived miraculously form  a death bed by a pretty face and a shapely leg, is the movies' most engaging character. It gave him a field day for winking and mugging, whispering and roaring, shuffling around in a nightgown, romping over chairs and kicking up his heels in a thumping conga.",958608000,3,1586,4.783882783882784
631880,5,6303328199,"After ""Three Smart Girls"", this is my second favourite Deanna film.  I just love the chemistry that she has with Robert Cummings (what a cutie!), chemistry that occurred again in ""Three Smart Girls Grow  Up"", even though she didn't end up with him in that one.  A witty  script added to Deanna's beautiful voice and flair for physical comedy (how  about that chair trick!) make this one of her best, but I still haven't  worked where ""Eve"" came into it.",955584000,,453,4.6
