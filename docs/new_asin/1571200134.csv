7797278,5,1571200134,Great music and the actors are some of the best. Both my husband and I loved it. Plan to watch it again.,1376784000,,104,3.772727272727273
7797279,5,1571200134,"Wow, I just watched Crazy, and as a musician and guitarist, I can't believe I have overlooked the wonderful musical legacy of Hank Garland.  This was a fine movie with excellent performances, but especially noteworthy is the guitar playing of Dean Parks, who recreated the tracks of wizardry originally conceived by the subject of this film.  Thanks to virtuoso guitarist and founder of record label Favored Nations, Steve Vai, for producing this insightful story of one of Nashville's greatest guitar legends, who not only blazed trails in country, but also collaborated with some of the finest jazz artists of the 50s and 60s.  No doubt I will be buying this movie and soundtrack for the purpose of learning ""Crazy"" guitar playing (pun intended, ha!).  Hank Garland's playing was certainly on par with the great Chet Atkins and has undoubtedly served as an inspiration to any top-notch country guitarist in the last 40 years.",1297987200,,927,5.03921568627451
7797280,5,1571200134,"Country music lovers and musicians alike will love this movie. Hank Garland was a pioneer in the Nashville Recording industry. As a collegue to another great guitar master, Chet Atkins, he was a chicken picking fool.  You have heard his guitar licks on some of the great country music's greatest talents such as Patsy Cline and Roy Orbison. Waylon Payne is a newcomer to Hollywood that is worthy of your attention! He is wonderful as the lead in this movie.  You may remember him from th movie ""Walk the line"" where he played Jerry Lee Lewis. Ali Larter does a great job as his wife in this film. This is not a rosy picture of the early days of Nashville, it is a true representation of just how crooked the ""powers that be"" were in the 40's and 50's. Songwriters and musicians alike were hired hands, that for the most part, were not compensated for thier talents. Hank Garland fought for rights for songwriters and musicians to no avail. If you are a fan of country music you will want to add this movie to your library. You won't be sorry!",1292371200,,1042,4.450261780104712
7797281,1,1571200134,"Don't misread this, I'm not saying anything negative about the product, quite the opposite, I am certain ""Crazy"" would have been a pleasure to see, however imagine this situation:  Living in South Africa with very limited supply on BD's, especially if you looking for something not mainstream, on average 3 times the cost in comparison to the US or Europe.
What can one do, order 17 pieces via Amazon, reasonable priced, ok 50% transport + taxes, what can one do? Hallelujah, it works, 3 weeks later everything arrives in good order, thanks Amazon... Surprise, surprise 4 of 17 do not play, wrong region code, my mistake for sure, no problem most of them are inclusive digital copy, lets do this. Ups somebody clever is reading my PC is situated in Africa, error, blah, blah.
What now, returning, this will cost an additional 50% portage.
Option, buying a second play station 3 region code A at USD 300 + transport + duties? Who will guaranty updates etc. will work.
Sorry just frustrated, thanks for nothing Sony and 20th. Century Fox for taking my hard earned cash !!!!
Hope somebody will read this.",1285113600,,1101,4.7643979057591626
7797282,5,1571200134,"I saw this movie at a small theater in St. Charles, Illinois . I was blown away by the performances of Waylon Payne and Ali Marter. I only wish it would have gotten a wider distribution. Maybe now more people will discover this ""gem of a movie"".The music is also WONDERFUL ...especially the cameo appearance by one of Nashville's best kept secrets..singer Mandy Barnett..with her renditions of "" I Fall To Pieces"" and""Waling After Midnight"".She captures Patsy Cline perfectly with only a fifvr minute appearance!!!Diana Krall does a good sultry job with the title tune""Crazy""..I only wish they would have had the forsight to let Mandy have that one!!!

Bravo..FIVE STARS!!!!!
