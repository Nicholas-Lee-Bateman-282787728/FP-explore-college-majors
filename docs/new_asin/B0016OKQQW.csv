8263588,4,B0016OKQQW,"A very well done biography about one the Union Armies leading spy networks leaders during the American Civil War. It includes information about his early life, personal life, war time activities, and post war career. His post war career is subject to debate as in the great Chicago fire in the last 19th Century burned the Pinkerton office building along with the vast majority of their case files, casting much doubt on the novels he had published in an effort to keep some of the case files alive.  Overall it's a very good source of information about the United States first Private Eye.",1385510400,,590,4.728155339805825
