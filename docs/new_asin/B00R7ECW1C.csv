6901713,3,B00R7ECW1C,"Onmyd was a form of yin-yang magic/natural science that was practiced in Japan for many centuries -- think Druids, but with more Taoism.

It also hasn't been practiced in a few hundred years. But in the world of ""Tokyo Ravens: Season 1, Part 1,"" it has endured into the twenty-first century and is a recognized, state-supported way of dealing with big disgusting monsters and the occasional world war.  The first half of this anime series is a pretty spotty affair -- it has likable characters and is both epic and spellbinding when it deals with actual onmyoji stuff... but for some reason, there is a lot of high school drivel crammed in there too.

Harutora Tsuchimikado is part of one of Japan's oldest and most respected onmyo families, despite a ""Great Disaster"" caused by a spell gone wrong by the legendary Yakou Tsuchimikado. Despite this heritage, Harutora has no supernatural abilities, and absolutely no ambition. He just wants to hang out and enjoy his final high school year with his friends Touji and Hokuto... until a rogue onmyoji appears in town, and Hokuto is brutally killed. Even weirder: she turns out to be a magical shikigami being controlled by an unknown mage.

Enraged, Harutora asks his awkward cousin Natsume to make him her familiar, which will give him supernatural powers and allow him to get revenge for Hokuto. Despite Harutora's inexperience and Natsume's ineptitude, they manage to save the day... but now Harutora and Touji have to go to Tokyo to attend an elite academy for onmyo mages.

Harutora soon finds that not flunking is the least of his problems -- adorable but overzealous familiars, hostile classmates, and having to hide Natsume's gender. Yes, Natsume is pretending to be a boy for.... some reason, which causes the obvious hijinks (especially with dorm mothers obsessed with pretty teen boys getting it on). Unfortunately, they soon encounter the darker side of this magical world -- a fanatical cult of Yakou worshippers, Touji's inner monster, and a supernatural threat that could level the city.

The biggest problem with ""Tokyo Ravens"" is that it can't make up its mind what it wants to be. It wants to be a lightweight high-school comedy, but it also wants to be a twisted, action-packed urban fantasy series about ancient magic. So it swings like a pendulum between wacky hijinks (Misunderstandings! Romantic tension! Arguments! Hiding in love hotels! Field trips!) and explosive battles between monsters and mages. And there's no real transition between these two kinds of stories.

And frankly, the school stuff is pretty awful -- a giant mass of school/comedy cliches, with gags that you can see coming a mile away (oh noes! People think Harutora is gay because Natsume pretends to be a boy! WACKY!). The show hits its stride when it sticks to the darker magical stuff, which is kept tightly intertwined with the character development. For instance, a running subplot is that Touji has an evil oni that feeds on his dark thoughts and threatens to turn him into a monster, which is triggered by the magical chaos running rampant in Tokyo. And of course, Natsume is being stalked by mad-eyed cultists who will kill anyone who gets in their way.

The action scenes are the meat of it, despite some painfully obvious CGI models (that spider-demon is just painful to watch) -- lots of explosive colorful energy, swords and the occasional dragon. And the government agency that uses onmyo mages is a pretty interesting one -- being on the ""good"" side doesn't mean that some of them aren't deranged and/or nasty.

One of the series' stronger points is Harutora -- despite being kind of dim (it literally takes him ten episodes to figure out who Hokuto really was, despite the OBVIOUS HINTS), he's depicted as a slackerish, good-hearted guy who just kind of goes with the flow and doesn't take anything too seriously unless pushed. It's also a bit rare to see an anime action hero who is actually the coolest-headed person in the cast.

And they do a good job developing most of the supporting characters, such as the seemingly too-cool-to-emote Touji, who has an ugly dark side at war with his altruistic impulses, or the feisty and rather loud Kyoko. The problem is Natsume -- not only is she one of those romantic interests who whines, blushes and has tantrums all the time, but she is revealed to have been secretly stalking Harutora for YEARS. Presumably this is supposed to be because she has never had any friends, but she still seems creepy and passive-aggressive.

""Tokyo Ravens Season 1 Part 1"" is at its best when it focuses on the omnyo magic instead of the school hijinks -- and its biggest handicap is the wild swinging between these two genres. It's a fun show, but it could have been a lot more.",1430352000,5,4763,4.853448275862069
6901714,5,B00R7ECW1C,"Tokyo Ravens had a skeptical name in my book but after hearing how good it was on social media I just had to check it out for myself. Currently I started watching the series not too long ago and all I have to say it started interesting enough heard otherwise that it was slow but to me it was well executed but might be difficult to keep up with all the info thrown at you. Overall would like to say if you decide to pick this up I guarentee It will not disappoint, in a way this reminds me of A Certain Magical Index / A Certain Scientific Railgun but that's just my opinion.",1428451200,7,576,4.06140350877193
6901715,5,B00R7ECW1C,This is a great series! I randomly found it last week and fell in love with it instantly! As it says this is only the 1 part of the 1st season. It gives you the first 12 episodes with the rest of the season (part 2) being released this summer. I watched the first 12 episodes in English and then continued on to the Japanese version with English subtitles I liked it so much! I'm anxiously waiting for Part 2 to come out so I can finish the season in English as well. The beginning of the series may start off a bit slow to some people (I didn't mind it) but I promise it does start to pick up! There is quite a few twists and turns and secrets in this series! I love the humor of it and the underline romance! I encourage you to give it a shot if humor/romance/action are your thing!,1427846400,6,784,4.032051282051282
6901716,5,B00R7ECW1C,"4 1/2 STARS  -- FOR A BEAUTIFUL AND FUN ANIME WITH SOME COMPLEX STORY ARCS

SEE NOTES ON JAPANESE vs. ENGLISH DUB BELOW

Tokyo Ravens is a terrific anime centered around the use of magic and casting spells, with a romance at its center of course.  The art is beautiful and the main characters are well fleshed out (some minor characters could be more developed).  The story arcs are nicely complex and a lot of characters, invented magic terms, and mysteries are thrown out to the viewer so it can require a little concentration at times.  For me that was a plus because I enjoy anime with a lot of thought put into it.  That aside, this one still has no problem staying light and fun thanks to some great characters.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Harutora is a member of a branch of the famous Tsuchimikado family which was a founding member of Onmyo Magic.  Unfortunately he seems to have no aptitude for magic like his ancestors and just wants to be around great friends and have fun.  The story opens as he hangs out with Touji, his best bud, and Hakuto the young girl he thinks of as just a friend.  They affectionately call him ""baka-Tora"" (stupid-Tora as a take on his real name Harutora) for his goofy and good natured personality.  Naturally, Touji is the only one that seems to really understand everything that is going on between the two.  However, another female childhood friend named Natsume re-enters Harutora's life and things get complicated.  Natsume is the heir to the main branch of the Tsuchimikado family itself and its next head.  It is even said she is the reincarnation of the very founder Yakou.  Ultimately, Harutora will return with Natsume to Onmyo Prep school to pursue his magic studies.  Together with friends old and new, Harutora's circle will be caught up in cataclysmic power struggles between magical organizations.  There are continual battles of magic, both real and those held in practice at the school arena.  Harutora will have to sort out his feelings while progressing along his own journey of self discovery.  Many other characters have their own strange secrets to be revealed.

It is a tale of conflicting organizations such as the Onmyo Magic Investigation Agency that is supposed to protect, and the Twin Horn Syndicate with its creepy and enigmatic ""D"".  It is also a tale of three powerful clans that founded Onmyo Magic, led by Tsuchimikado but including Kurahashi and Souma.  Besides the lead characters, there are many others that are very memorable.  Suzuka Dairenji (the prodigy) is the youngest of the Twelve Divine Generals and has this ominous whistle tune that plays in the background when she arrives (a take on Ennio Morricone music from the Fist Full of Dollars films).  I love that tune and she's hilarious!  Kon is a little fox spirit type familiar for Harutora that is adorable.  The list goes on.

JAPANESE vs. ENGLISH DUB: On the DVD/Blu-Ray version, you have your choice of original Japanese or the English Dub.  On Amazon Streaming, you have to choose on or the other separately.  Overall I was pretty impressed with the English version and the voice acting was quite good.  However, there are naturally some trade offs.  Some characters, though acted well, loose some of their characteristic personalities in the English versions.  Touji is less edgy (as in cool) than the Japanese version, and both he and Natsume have slightly more mature voices.  Kon the familiar however is pretty much dead on with her counterpart.  For personalities sake, I prefer the Japanese version.  However, there are so many invented magical terms, organizations, story arcs, personalities, and relationship nuances thrown out that I found the English version far easier to absorb what is going on, and I am a Japanese speaker.  The script from the English dub also differs in minor ways from the script on the English subtitle version and it makes if flow a little better (visual image is unchanged).  This is possible because the English dub does not have to match Japanese simultaneously as the subtitles do.  The translation in general is quite good and the English dub keeps it very colloquial to match the appropriate slang here and there. I can't guarantee it matches everyone's taste, but this is definitely a high quality anime!",1422316800,17,4284,4.855172413793103

6901719,5,B00R7ECW1C,"This is a great anime. Wonderful story and a complete plot. It does end with a little mystery but its in no way a cliffhanger that would upset anyone. The dub work is good as well as the artwork. Its about 24 episodes if you get part one and part 2. The packaging was a little weird since it came in two different boxes that you are intended to put together. At any rate this is a must see anime for anyone looking for a coming of age story, some action/magic, and a little romance.",1439942400,,482,4.08421052631579
