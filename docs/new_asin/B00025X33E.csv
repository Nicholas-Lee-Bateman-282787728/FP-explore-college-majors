8516515,3,B00025X33E,"Admitedly, when I read the synopsis of this film on the DVD cover, I expected to see something a little different than what I saw. The main protagonist in this work is a pool player named ALAN (Roc Tien) who can hold his own against anyone. At one point he is challenged for a $500,000 stake and manages to defeat his challenger.

Also, Chen Sing and Kam Kong are in this film in villain/mobster roles.  Although Champ Wang is billed as
the star in the movie, he's really only in a secondary role subordinate to Roc Tien and is seen only sparingly.
At one point he recounts the time when he was viciously attacked by a band of mafia thugs (Chen Sing's henchmen), but his character throughout the film was rather stoic and showed little emotion or outward desire for vengeance. Towards the end of the film he does deliver the payback to his tormenters however at great cost to his own well being.

For the billiards enthusiast you might appreciate this film as I did because its the overriding theme of the movie.

For the martial arts fan you would be better served looking elsewhere because this movie was lacking in this category.",1362268800,,1132,4.534313725490196
