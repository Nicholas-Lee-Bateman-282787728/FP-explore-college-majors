8606743,5,B00ELSO5YO,"I must say that I was pretty excited to receive my copy of this collection of short films, especially Paper People. All three films were brilliantly done and very entertaining to watch. I hadn't heard of the other two short films, but I was blown away by the last film, You Don't Know Bertha Constantine. It was beautifully shot and the story was so touching and moving it brought me to tears. Bravo guys!",1378771200,,405,4.486486486486487
8606744,5,B00ELSO5YO,"This is a great collection of shorts with well written characters and riveting plot lines.
Wunderland is a glimpse of a moment at the front lines of WWII.
You Don't Know Bertha Constantine reflects devotion in the worst kind of adversity. I could relate strongly to Bertha's courage, determination, and loyalty.
Paper People, which has received a great deal of accolades at short film festivals, is intense and intriguing with an ending not to be missed.
The directing and writing team of Andrew Kightlinger and Luke Schuetzle are truly dynamic and I look forward to future productions from this duo.",1378771200,,600,5.01
8606745,4,B00ELSO5YO,"I have seen all three of these shorts by the Schuetzle Prodcution Company.  Each one is well crafted.  ""Paper People"" is a well written story with solid performances by the cast.  It is well directed and the post production work is top quality.  This short has swept the film festival circuit.  ""Wunderland"" is a tense WWII battle scene.  It was shot as a pilot for a web series.  It was very well done.  ""You Don't Know Bertha Constantine"", is a well written and performed story of a grieving widow struggling to honor her loved one's life.  This award winning script transitioned to the silver screen nicely.  The collection is a must have, if you like short films.",1377302400,,667,4.6239316239316235
