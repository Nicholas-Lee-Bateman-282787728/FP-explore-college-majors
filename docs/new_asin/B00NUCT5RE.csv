6680304,2,B00NUCT5RE,I'll never get that time back. Kept waiting for something exciting to happen but it never did.,1448409600,,94,4.588235294117647
6680305,4,B00NUCT5RE,"I liked this movie.  Slow at times, but realistic, with good acting.  You actually feel like what it would be like to be in this situation.  The frustration and total loss of control of you life.  The end is very sad.  You know it won't end well.",1448323200,3,246,4.148936170212766
6680306,1,B00NUCT5RE,"Please do not waste your money on a film like this! This could have been a good film but obviously no one gave a damn. They didn't do one thing to survive except bitch and argue thru the whole film. It was painful to finish but kept thinking something would happen in this film to redeem itself, but to no avail. Best moment was seeing the credits!",1446508800,,348,4.208955223880597
6680307,3,B00NUCT5RE,"3.5 stars really. The dialogue is realistic & relevant to the characters.  It's hard to tell what era this film is supposed to be in,  we are to believe the time is before GPS or other navigational & communication devices which would be essential for a ship wrecked crew to use for signaling for help.  It would have been good to have the film start with the storm & loss of the ship, that would have been an attention getter.  I kind of find it difficult to believe they didn't have a flare or two with them, though. Otherwise, I liked it.  I could see this as being a play on stage. It would work well that way. Maybe add a scene or two w/  more drama of spirit.",1445126400,3,664,4.108527131782946

6680315,5,B00NUCT5RE,"A diamond in the rough, and a wonderful surprise. The Disappeared is one of those movies, which will grab your imagination and break your heart. I highly recommend it to anyone who will appreciate an honest movie masterpiece.",1484611200,,225,4.947368421052632

6680317,2,B00NUCT5RE,so predictable that i kept thinking  i had seen it before .then i realized that this movie followed the same template as all the movies like this,1483574400,,145,4.37037037037037

6680323,3,B00NUCT5RE,"I Love films about the ocean, this film really doesn't tell you how they got there or what happened at the end of the film. So it leaves you wondering.
Survival out on the ocean or in a desert, which would be worse?
I really loved the camera work on this film some beautiful shots. The characters carry the film and make it interesting, however this is not a Twilight Zone where you have to use your imagination and should have had a better ending.",1482105600,,448,4.2823529411764705
6680324,3,B00NUCT5RE,ok,1477094400,,2,2.0
6680325,2,B00NUCT5RE,"Sort of pointless, with a particularly pointless ending. Sure glad I didn't spend anything on it.",1476576000,,97,5.125

6680329,3,B00NUCT5RE,"A group of guys in two boats ends up being a group of guys in one boat after one guys dies, and they decide not to toss his rotting corpse. Supposedly they become more emotionally aware and connected as they try to survive and so on and so forth. The plot is predictable and unexciting. There are other and much better films that tell the story of groups of people struggling to survive while lost at sea. This one just never makes it off the runway.",1473638400,3,450,4.244186046511628
6680330,3,B00NUCT5RE,"This was a good movie, it was not what I expected. It kept my interest, I wanted to find out what happened to them.",1473552000,,115,3.8333333333333335

6680336,3,B00NUCT5RE,"Movie is full of the F word.  Since I don't use profanity, this took away the enjoyment of the movie for me.  Ending was surprising,",1468540800,,132,4.24

6680344,1,B00NUCT5RE,no meat to story. no ending,1463097600,,27,3.6666666666666665
6680345,3,B00NUCT5RE,A sad story of 6 men who somehow lost their ship and are floating on the sea in two lifeboats.  The acting is superb and the men learn to accept their fate.  Acting and being out somewhere at sea is ominous and depressing.  A good movie but don't expect any happy endings.,1462838400,,272,4.1923076923076925
6680346,1,B00NUCT5RE,six men and a boat.... fog and the end. Basically that is the movie,1462406400,2,67,3.857142857142857

6680361,4,B00NUCT5RE,"I like this type of movie. Plays out like an Independent film, so if you need action all the time in a movie, you may not like it. I did.",1452124800,3,137,3.6
6680362,2,B00NUCT5RE,"I did not like it because of the ending.  I spent over an hour watching a survival movie only to have the worse ending possible.  If I had known the ending, I would not have watched it!",1449964800,,185,3.972972972972973
8680287,1,B00NUCT5RE,Boring,1506297600,,6,6.0
8680288,5,B00NUCT5RE,"Don't watch this to see a regular movie formula film. This film is more about existential nothingness. Life and death, but ultimately, men pitted against physics, hard facts, nature and its laws. It moves VERY VERY VERY VERY slowly, and all you see is men in a boat, and the ocean. At first I was extremely mad about the ending, but I discussed the film with a California screenwriter who understood what kind of film it was, and how it was like reading Camus or Sartre. Nothing formulaic. Just a mirror of your own life, when you get to the point where you see only nothingness. (SPOILER ALERT: Since they had a loaded gun, why didn't they fire it when they saw the ship so close? That about ruined the picture for me, the stupidity of that, and not one character acknowledging that oversight?)",1501891200,,795,4.527777777777778

8680291,1,B00NUCT5RE,A bunch of confrontational guys fighting and arguing. Pretty lame. Lost my patience and couldn't finish the film.,1492387200,,113,5.333333333333333
8680292,3,B00NUCT5RE,Made it halfway through. Interesting sketches on human nature but I don't have the time to get to the end.,1486598400,,106,4.35
8680293,1,B00NUCT5RE,I like survival movies but this is so far from reality it is not even worth the time to try and watch.,1486339200,,102,3.6818181818181817
