8541265,5,B009GH4RU2,"Beware; this DVD is exactly the same as the Punk Revolution-Live In London one. That said, it's worth every penny they're charging for it. This gig was recorded at the Camden Palace Theater in London. Live, but not before an audience, just the camera crew and some punk acquaintances, so no shots of the crowd, and fake audience noise between songs. This should not deterr you from getting this piece of punk rock history though, because all of the band's fire and incredibly tight playing are as present as in a real live concert.

The lineup is that of the then recently reformed band who would record the Huntington Beachalbum that very same year. The setlist, however, is heavy on their debut album from '79 and some singles, with little or nothing from the subsequent albums, concentrating on the rockier numbers and ignoring the more experimental, metally or goth-tinged directions of Flood Of Liesand Diminished Responsibility, probably because the band were heading into a rockier direction, demonstrated by the album they were about to record and the fierce renditions of the Subs' classics, played  blazingly-fast and in rapid-fire succession; 20 songs in 54 merciless minutes.

Picture : it's excellent 4:3 VHS quality. Filmed with 5 cameras but you only realize the fact upon reading the final credits, because the angles are so well edited and directed you will swear there were 20 cameras shooting at the same time. The film was directed by none other than famous movie director Robert Garofalo; what a treat !!! The pic bitrate could have been higher weren't for the fact that this is a single-layer DVD with DD 2.0 + DD5.1 + DTS soundstreams, which take a lot of space on the disc.

Sound : detailed, dynamic, thunderous and incredibly well-mixed, almost perfect if only it had a little more bottom end, but unusual for a punk recording from the mid 80s. Rab  is an unleashed animal behind his drum kit.  Guitarrist James Moncour SHREDS on guitar and the bassist cuts in on the mix precisely with his mostly trebley, superbly creative, pick-played basslines.

Conclusion : essential for any UK Subs' fan. If you have to own but just one video, get the Live In Bremen one or this one as your second.",1472083200,,2214,4.825857519788919
