1778925,3,B00006IUJP,"Okay, I love gangster movies. The Untouchables, from DePalma, Casino and Goodfellas, from Scorsese, The Godfather (the whole series) from Coppola...even Hoodlum, from Bill Duke...Gangster No. 1 goes in that range of films, but it's not as good. I'm ashamed to say that, except for Clockwork Orange, I haden't seen a lot of movies featuring Malcolm MacDowell...but maybe it's normal considering the quality of his films today (Island of The Dead, for example). But the Mr. MacDowell I knew in one of my all-time favorites, Clockwork Orange, was splendid, full of talent. The MacDowell in Gangster No. 1 was pretty good, but that's not enough...David Thewlis wasn't always good either, except at the end. This film mostly happens in 1968, but it passes through 31 years, up to 1999...what is sad about that is that we see what happens in detail during 1968, but we show brief sequences for the other years, and many are simply skipped. The problem here is that we follow a young gangster, full of ambition, with absolutely no heart feelings, that finally gets to his goal, but the film stops showing his evolution right after he starts it, and skips to his final situation. This could have been three hours long, but it's only 103 minutes. That's not enough for a gangster movie that has so much to say. The film contains some brutal violence, like any good gangster movie, but they put it in needless contexts, and it's mostly pretty gratuitous. The message is pretty clear in this film, and the character of Freddie Mays has an interesting mind twist that brings it to an ending that is intense, true, but that could have been even better. The film had more potential. The film tells a story, but rushes some parts too evidently, and that ruins it. It's not a bad movie, but it's not great either.",1065484800,3,1797,4.744408945686901
1778926,4,B00006IUJP,"This movie is great. Highly entertaining, fast moving, great script, great direction, superb acting, ultra violent, clever, what more do you need? This movie charts the rise to power of the unamed gangster who stares in this film. He is the ultimate gangster because he has no feelings, he is a complete sociopath, a machine, he has no tender emotions to exploit and therefore no weakness to take advantage of. He is only concerned with power and money, he does not even seem that interested in women. He is highly intelligent and pragmatic, he sees through everyone and instantly recognizes other's weak points. He is the Alpha male, but he is quiet about it. He is subtle, not loud, he does not try to prove how tough he is by talk, his actions alone cause others to fear him. His is a quiet but intense presence, his violence will explode unexpectadly. He can stare down anyone. His perception of reality is tottally materialistc and unhindered by any sort of sentiment or ideology. This gives him a distint advantage over everyone else. The other gangsters in this movie are low life criminals who maim and kill people for a living but they still have feelings, and principals like loyality. The main character in this movie has no such dangerous illusions. After a hard day of extortion and murder they like to party down with some attractive women. Gangster No. 1 is concerned only with buisness. He is a lone wolf and has no friends nor does he want them. When he looks at people and thinks about them all he thinks about are their clothes and their money and their position. The only emotions he feels are either contempt or jeoulosy. He is recruited by Freddy Mays, who he idolizes as an example to which to aspire, however he is eventually dissapointed in Mays when he discoves that Mays is ""soft"" because he has feelings and emotions. Because he is more than just a gangster. Mays has other intrests outside of killing and money and Gangster No. 1 takes this as a sign of weakness. The harsh truth is that Gangster No. 1 is correct, in the world of crime any emotion besides calculated agression is a weakness. May's is just not ruthless enough, he is to restrained, to much the diplomat. Gangster No. 1 has an unquenchable thirst for power and money, and he does not fear anyone. Freddy is tough but not as tough as Gangster No. 1. Gangster No. 1 does not fit into society at all, even among gangsters he is the worst of the worst. The only sort of person that is comprable to him is a serial killer. The other members of his crew, run by Freddy, fail to realize the truth about Gangster No. 1. He is not just another one of the guys, their is something really wrong with him, he is just bad. While the rest of his companions might be barracudas he is a shark. When Freddy falls in love with a beautiful dancer Gangster No. 1 realizes that Freddy is destined to fall  because of his sentiment. He lets other rival gangsters get away with things he never should have, Freddy is to willing to negotiate instead of just taking what he wants. Gangster No. 1 seizes the opportunity for power with a brillant plan that complimants his evil nature and reveals his abyss of a soul. He is only out for himself and that mentality proves to be his greates asset. The point of this movie is that to the be Gangster No. 1 is to be the biggest scumbag around, instead of a compliment it is a character  idictment. To be Gangster No. 1 is to have no friends, no feelings, no belifes. It is to be feared by all and loved by none. But do not get me wrong, this no moral parable about the corruption of power, or some kind of touchy feely insightful piece about the emptyniess of living only for yourself and your own enrichment, it is simply a statement of fact. People tend to glofify gangsters in movies as honorable, or at least likealbe rouges who play by their own rules. Or as complex, contriditorcy characters who the viwer can both love and hate. Most gangster movies have some moral ambiguity, most gangsters in movies have some reediming qualities. Not Gangster No. 1 though, and because he has no reediming qualities and is not in the least likable he is the most sucessful. He is also more of a realistic portraly of gangsters than other films of today. Gangsters are scum and are not nearly as likeable as the characters on the ""Sopranos"" or ""Goodfellas"" or the ""Godfather"". To be Gangster No. 1 is to be a gangter and nothing else. Their is nothing funny, good, or likeable about that. This movie tells it like it is. I also like the fact that it takes place in the late 1960s during the whole civl rights struggle and hippie movement and none of that is even mentioned at all. When looking back people tend to glorfiy time periods more than they deserved and make them out to be different than they actually were. But in truth the bottom line is that life is all about Gangsters and their power plays, that is how the rules of our society are decided, that is how who is in charge is decided, and that is the way it has always been since life first began. Anyone who tells you different is either a delusional sucker or a lying gangster.",1055980800,9,5147,4.462845010615712

1778930,5,B00006IUJP,"Who is Freddie Mays?  This is the inherent question that must be asked when trying to learn more about Gangster 55.  Is Freddie Mays really the ""Butcher of Mayfair"" as everyone calls him?
David Thewlis (Naked, Besieged, 7 Years in Tibet) pulls off a brilliant Oscar-worthy performance as Freddie Mays, adding some genuine depth and subtlety to one that could've easily been overacted.  He also provides a good balance for the highly stylized filmmaking that is chock full of grainy shots.  Malcolm McDowell also provides a very intense post-Clockwork Orange performance that could very well be Alexander De Large all grown up.  Paul Bettany who plays the younger Gangster 55 carries the same kind of crazed intensity and jealousy very well.  Bettany also played John Nash's imaginary roommate, Charles, in ""A Beautiful Mind"".  It's possible Brian Grazer may have hired Bettany after seeing him in this movie.
So who is truly Gangster No. 1?  Who holds the kind of power that everyone else envies?  You will have to see for yourself... This movie is somewhat graphic with its violence, so people with no stomach for it should steer clear.  Expect great acting, small laughs and very stylish photographic visuals.",1032393600,4,1211,5.040201005025126

1778932,4,B00006IUJP,"The first time I heard of ""Gangster No. 1"" was in the Globe And Mail. The one thing that intrigued me to find it upon it's DVD release, was the front quote.
""It's not who you know. It's who you kill.""
Thus, my trip to Future Shop was to be a grand day on taking chances on films! Let me tell you, THIS MOVIE IS SUPERB. It does for gangster films in the same way Akira Kurosawa does for humanistic films, with a kick of style! For the first time, you don't get constant gore & language, unlike Scorsese's mafia flicks.
The year: 1968.
It brings forth a man known by the name of Gangster, who is extremely arrogant in his own way, to have a meeting with ""The Butcher Of Mayfair,"" Freddie Mays. Mays has just won a case against the city, in a matter of him killing a cop. An extremely well known man with the mafia who has just reached the top for whacking this crooked copper. But Mays is still having problems it seems. The problem? Lennie Taylor, another rival gang boss who plans to take out Freddie and capture his territory. But when Gangster hears of this (being as arrogant as he is), he pulls together a plan to take both of them out, leaving the rest for himself at the top. With an ending that'll make you watch the movie over and over again, ""Gangster No. 1"" is quite effectively THE crime drama of 2001, no doubt about it!",1021161600,17,1332,4.227450980392157

1778936,4,B00006IUJP,"The dual themes of ambition and betrayal on display here are Shakespearean in scope.  ""Gangster No. 1"" is informed in equal measures by the British crime tradition and the work of Martin Scorsese notably ""Goodfellas"".  The film traces the rise and fall of a nameless hood played as a young man by Paul Bettany and Malcolm McDowell in his later years.  The first three-quarters of the film work splendidly charting the hood's rise.  It's the latter part of the film that falters where events just rush past lacking in resonance.  I think the success of the film depends on the two actors being in synch with one another.  I find no fault with Bettany's performance.  You find no problem believing that he could be McDowell in a younger incarnation.  McDowell, on the other hand, as he chews the scenery makes it hard to believe he was once Bettany. David Thewlis, though, is terrific as the gentleman mob leader set up by Bettany's character.  ""Gangster No. 1"" is a film that falls short of its intentions but has to be admired for aiming high.",1343779200,,1043,4.655737704918033

1778938,5,B00006IUJP,"London, 1999: After some thirty years of living a life of affluence and ease acquired through ill-gotten gains, the odious ""Gangster 55"" (Malcolm McDowell) appears to be the antithesis of the statement concerning crime not paying. However, during a sojourn to a prize-fight with a group of similarly aged underworld cronies, 55 learns that Freddie Mays (David Thewlis), the man whose fall from power was responsible for his ascent to the pinnacle of the underworld, has recently been released from prison. The revelation dredges up a profound reminiscence of the year 1969, when as a younger man (Paul Bettany), 55 joined Mays' organization and began his meteoric rise to criminal stardom at the devastating expense of those around him.

By all rights, Paul McGuigan's ""Gangster No1"" should've been a film that took its place amongst the pantheon of British Gangster films such as ""Get Carter"", ""The Long Good Friday"", ""The Krays"" , ""Sexy Beast"" and ""Layer Cake"" that are generally considered to be the best in the genre. Criminally - pun intended - it didn't. To my mind, this is largely due to some rather witless marketing in the form of an extremely misguided trailer which emulated the tone of Guy Ritchie's then recently released ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"" (which GN1 did, at least cosmetically, resemble). Accordingly, audiences went into the film expecting a fun-filled joy-ride through the London underworld which emulated ""The Italian Job"" and were instead treated to a mesmerizing, hypnotically dark journey through the memories of a man who has sacrificed everything and betrayed the love of his life in order to attain the position of top dog.

The other reason I suspect that it failed to hook an audience of young, predominantly heterosexual, white males that generally make or break this kind of film is because, if you look at the subtext, it is essentially, the story of a psychopath's unrequited, unspoken homosexual longing for a heterosexual man and the murderous, heartbroken depths to which he descends when the subject of his idolatry falls in love with a woman. It would seem then that the audiences of 1999 were fine with London gangsters engaging in orgiastic acts of casual violence - as long as they went home and slept with a ""bird"" afterwards (this despite the fact that there were several notoriously homosexual London gangsters operating in sixties London, the most notorious being Ronnie Kray, and that an element of ""pink gangland"" continued to exist well into the seventies, and one imagines, continues to exist to this day)

But one should not focus too much on the reasons for this film's failure, but rather on the brilliance of the film itself, which, despite being populated with very clichd gangster archetypes and sporting a very stylized look and abstract structure, has, in it's own obtuse way, more of a sense of reality about the time and the place in which it is set than any other film on the subject (with the possible exception of the BBC adaptation of Jake Arnott's ""The Long Firm"").

For my money, Paul Bettany has never been better than he is in this film and this should have been the vehicle that put him on the Hollywood map; his performance as the immaculately suited, habitually pathological ""young 55"" is nothing short of a revelation. His piercing eyes are used to devastating effect and his skeletal, almost eyebrow-less face mark him out as something almost ethereally dangerous amongst the group of metropolitan ne'er do wells amongst whom he moves. And he's not alone. One need only watch the scene in which Bettany menaces the porcine ""Little Eddie"" (played to sweaty, desperate perfection by the massively underrated Eddie Marsan) to observe the standard of acting in this film. Never have the words ""Look at me. Look into my eyes"" carried such menacing import. Likewise, McDowell's turn as the older, progressively more bitter incarnation of Bettany's character is grandiose, over-the-top and pitch-perfect; one really does get the impression that he's been fermenting in a caustic mixture of egomania, resentment and heartbreak-sublimated-into-anger for the intervening thirty years. Kudos also goes to David Thewlis for his turn as the vain ""Freddie Mays"" and Saffron Burrows for her impressive but understated performance as Mays' ""dolly bird"" girlfriend, ""Karen"". Jamie Foreman also gives a spectacularly over-the-top turn as Mays' reptilian nemesis, ""Lennie Taylor"".

As a director, McGuigan channels the likes of Stanley Kubrick, Nicolas Roeg and Donald Cammel, and his stylized vision is reminiscent of films like ""Performance"" and the underrated early seventies Richard Burton/Ian Mcshane gangster vehicle, ""Villain"". The grandiosity of his operatic vision never overwhelms the inherent tragedy of the story and a bravura sequence in which we, as an audience, experience a protracted scene of torture (perpetrated by the ""young 55"") from the point of view of the victim impresses both as a disturbing stylistic exercise and an emotional lynchpin of the film (it's the first time that ""young 55"" shows any sign of emotion).

""Gangster No1"" is an underrated film and one that was doomed to languish in obscurity during it's original theatrical release. To my mind, this is vastly unfair as it is a far more accomplished piece of cinema than any of Guy Ritchie's ""Carry On"" films with guns. That and the bleak coda of the film, in which the egomaniacal McDowell realizes, but still consciously refuses to acknowledge, the love that he never had the courage to pursue, and then betrayed, as well as the lonely futility of the gilded cage existence that he has built for himself, lingers in the memory long after Neil Hannon's beautifully tender cover of the Sacha Distel song, ""The Good Life"", has played over the closing credits.

Paul Bettany's character is completely opposite to the one he plays in Wimbledon, which proves that he has talent to pull off the challenging task of acting out gangsta's role. A man that takes the meaning of 'gangsta' to a new level, that is both clever yet twisted.

The film which is based in 1960's London, has trembling violence and a storyline that will keep you enthralled until the very end. This story of greed, rationale and revenge, is British cinemas' version of Scarface, but is more realistic and not for the faint-hearted.

Be warned, if you are used to Hollywood fake gangsta's that are loveable rogues, then this is not for you. For all those others that enjoy realistic gangsta's with no compassion, no remorse just pure dedication then ths is your No. 1 - Gangster No. 1.",1145836800,5,957,4.684523809523809

1778944,3,B00006IUJP,"In this movie we have Malcom McDowell as the number one gangster in a mean, grimy England. Life is sweet but his old boss Freddie Mays has gotten out of jail after a 30 year stint. This sends Malcom into a tizzy and we get a long flashback. Paul Bettany plays the gangster as a young man and he does it well. He looks a  lot like McDowell did in Clockwork Orange. He's also got a dead eyed feral look that is just as scary as Malcom's.

The young gangster worked for Freddie Mays, idolized him, and wants to be just like him and hates him on some level too. Later in the movie you get the impression that he doesn't just want to be Freddie, he wants to be WITH Freddie.  Still, these half focused feelings are controlled until Freddie meets a girl and gets seriously involved with her. Young gangster snaps. He commits a particularly nasty murder, goes after the girlfriend and takes Freddie's empire.

Gangster Number 1 is extremely violent, bloody and has more profanity than a Deadwood episode. In other words, it's not for the kids or the tender minded. It's not a great movie. I wouldn't go as far as to call it a good one either. And it goes on for about 20 minutes too long but McDowell and  Bettany do give memorable performances.",1114905600,3,1238,4.3652173913043475
1778945,4,B00006IUJP,"Director Paul McGuigan directed Paul Bettany in ""The Reckoning"" which was a stylish medieval thriller.  He also directed ""Wicker Park"" whose soundtrack CD far exceeded the merits of the confusingly edited film.  ""Gangster No. 1"" is a decent crime drama that paints an unsympathetic look at Gangster 55 played by Paul Bettany in younger years and Malcolm McDowell in older years.  Bettany, whose recent romantic comedy ""Wimbledon"" was delightful and shows great range, is pretty scary here as a guy who has a great talent for hurting people.  He gets picked up in Freddie Mays' mob and apparently becomes jealous when Mays falls in love with the gorgeous Saffron Burrows.  David Thewlis who played Paul Verlaine to Leonardo DiCaprio's Rimbaud in ""Total Eclipse"" and also starred with Brad Pitt in ""7 Years in Tibet"" and most recently in ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" does a nice job of being the randy high roller in youth and then the older and reformed ex-con 25 years later.  Saffron Burrows who narrated the most recent Peter Pan movie and also played in ""Troy"" does a nice job as Karen who falls in love and then gets the ultimate sore throat.  Malcolm McDowell whose career was launched with ""A Clockwork Orange"" and most recently was the billionaire tycoon in ""In Good Company"" brings a great intensity to the role before his final swan dive.  Although this film is a bit bloody, it still was an interesting and entertaining crime genre film.  The pacing is a tightly controlled rampage.  I particularly enjoyed the lad running through the parking structure before Bettany's careening car.  The film is more visceral than thoughtful, but still interesting cinema.

1778947,4,B00006IUJP,"The other reviewer on this page who called this film a ""character study"" nailed it. The two lead gangsters Freddy Mays and (soon to be) gangster#1 could just as easily have been corporate execs., or two proball players, or....get the idea. This is a story about one mans driving, overwelming ambition to be #1, and what in the end is he left with when confronted with the man who was #1 but had it all stolen. More or less in a nut shell.
  This is why any comparison to Goodfellas,et al is silly. The gangster life is window dressing, making the film more entertaining, yes ( if you like violence thats mostly implied, but implied well) but essential to the main theme. Gangsters are used here the same way Ann Rice uses vampires, to comment about the human condition.
  Paul McGuigan directs well, using intresting camara techniques, and great lighting to show the lead characters descent into ambitious maddness. He uses music to its full effectiveness ( Reservoir Dogs ) with a rather happy ""Because I Love You"" adding to the evil menace of a murder scene which is the set piece of the film.
 Needless ( I believe )to say the acting is primo.

1778950,5,B00006IUJP,"Gangster No. 1 is an absolute peach, a Cockney version Goodfellas, but darker. Whereas Scorcese paints a much larger picture in his maffia films, director Paul McGuigan narrows the focus on one upwardly mobile thug - depicting his meteoric rise from poolroom bum to king of the underworld (spanning the years 1968 - present day. Above all, Gangster No. 1 is a study of evil that makes Goodfellas look like Bugsy Malone.  The acting, by Malcolm McDowell, David Thewliss (from ""Naked"") and in particular, the incendiary Paul Bettany - who is the pure personification of Evil - raises this movie high above Mafia-lite flicks like Snatch or Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrells. The film is top-quality in all other respects, too: the incidental music is spot on, the camerawork inventive and original, and - most importantly - Gangster No. 1 is a film that takes itself seriously. Not as high-budget or glamorous as Casino or Goodfellas (gangland London is no Las Vegas), but packs a powerful punch nevertheless.
Gangster No. 1 is a dark, brooding yet stylish film and shows that the Brits can make serious gangster movies when they put their minds to it. Non-Londoners might want to brush up on their Cockney slang, however, e.g. ""You're having a laugh, arn't you?"" = ""You must be kidding"", ""Bird"" = ""Girlfriend"", etc.",1073001600,7,1314,4.8923766816143495

What it does offer is an incredible performance from Paul Bettany, a skillful recycling of classic gangster pictures like 'Scarface' and 'Pulp Fiction', a few invigorating scenes of sardonic violence, very much in the tradition of 'Lock Stock...' and even 'Trainspotting', and a confident directorial grip, one that allowed Malcolm MacDowell once again attempt to return to his 'clockwork' form. Too bad the film doesn't belong to MacDowell, who appears as the aged protagonist briefly in the beginning and end of the film. Maybe it is for the better though, because at the end is when the film crumbles heavily under MacDowell's heavy rantings, while Paul Bettany, who plays the young gangster, is truly astonishing as a man hired by a mob boss and striving to gain his power. Sounds familiar? No doubt - that's good ol' 'Scarface', almost scene by scene, yet though Bettany pays homage with his lack of likeable qualities and ceaseless, demented determination to similar qualities that Pacino's Montana possessed, the young actor manages to twist it a little, distance it from the ferociousness of 'Scarface' by adding an element of poignancy to it. Consider the scene where he tortures someone, having turned up contrastively happy music. 'Reservoir Dogs', anyone? Yeah, but here we get the POV of the MAN being tortured - we're hooked.
 While offering nothing new and trodding off into dull, repetitive and predictable territory at its 80-minute mark, 'Gangster No1' mostly manages to avoid cliches while still being cliched, and is definitely worth watching for Bettany's powerhouse acting.
 The film is enthusiastic. The crew's love for the project is palpable. The director must have nurtured it for a while before he could watch his creation on the silver screen.",1069459200,,1847,5.173913043478261

7969747,5,B00006IUJP,"This.  Movie.  ROCKS!!!  This became one of my all time favorites just recently.  Violence, corruption, underhanded dealings and all with a very English rather than American organized crime flavor.  Paul Bettany is AWESOME as a villain, ghostlike and sinister with his appearance and coloring as a small time hanger on in a pool hall who one day comes to meet a London gangster, Freddy Mays, who needs some more muscle to keep others in line.  Paul (who is unnamed throughout this movie, but we assume he is Gangsters No 1) takes up with him, and becomes envious of Freddy's power and material things while Freddy admires the devotion and creative ways that the Gangster commits murder for him.  Soon the Gangster is anxious, thinking that he wants to be in command and also wants Freddy out of the picture.  He stands by and lets a lot of violence and corruption go down, and then murders Lennie Taylor (Freddy's chief rival) by hand with an axe in one of those most shockingly graphic murders ever caught on film.  Then Freddy goes to jail, and the Gangster becomes the leader of his gang.  For the next thirty years, the Gangster builds the empire and becomes more powerful than Freddy ever did.  He's Number1.

The underline message here is that power corrupts and that life in the fast lane is full of a hundred million little seductions, and it's all damned sexy.  And there's the right amount of sex and violence to make it all super cool.",1418688000,,1446,4.645669291338582
