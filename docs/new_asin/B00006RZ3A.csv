7972870,5,B00006RZ3A,"Very cute tunes, we use them in our geography class (homeschool); and the seller shipped quickly. All around happy.",1411171200,,115,5.105263157894737
7972871,5,B00006RZ3A,"This is # 2 in this series of Geography DVD's for children.  I found the songs in DVD # 2 to be even more catchy and fun than # 1.  This is, without doubt, a great buy.  I got this for my son when he was 4 or 5 and even though he is now 9 we still get watch the DVD every now and then.  (I do most of the singing)

My only complaint - I've been waiting too long for DVD # 3.  Come on, WeeBee guys, get cracking!",1324684800,2,411,3.4615384615384617
7972872,5,B00006RZ3A,My daughter loves these movies.  I find myself humming the tunes while I'm at work and think of her.  It's interesting little tidbits about the world and it's a great way to expose them to that.  I especially like that it's not all pixies and butterflies - in the story of Antarctica.,1239580800,2,284,4.423076923076923
7972873,5,B00006RZ3A,"Our entire family loves the WeeBee tunes videos.  Each song focuses on a different country and highlights what the country is known for.  We have often referred to these songs while completing homework assignments, and such.  My high school daughter even brought in one of the songs to her history class for them to memorize!",1202860800,2,325,4.872727272727273
7972874,3,B00006RZ3A,"I got the first one (Get your Passport) for my 4 year old nephew. He loves it. He asks to see it everyday and he dances and sings during the entire show. So I got him the second one. Its ok but he does not like the songs as much, does not dance and doesnt ask to see it so often. I watched it with him and agree that the songs are not as ""cool"" as the first one.",1185494400,2,362,3.5949367088607596
7972875,5,B00006RZ3A,"We bought this video and the first WeeBeeTunes video, and they are both excellent! Our older daughter wanted to show this to her friends as a favorite video during a recent long car trip!  We've given them to nieces and nephews as gifts, and all have loved them as our girls do!  The cool thing is both videos tell important facts about the various places (who discovered the South Pole, why is there a Great Wall in China, what do the aboriginie people of Australia believe?)All information is given in an animated, singing presentation that the kids love and keep singing long after the video is over.  One of the best kid products I've seen!",1176422400,3,644,4.582608695652174
7972876,5,B00006RZ3A,Our kids absolutely love these.  They are very well done and come highly recommended from someone who has bought lots of educational DVDs for my kids over the last 7 years!,1154822400,4,172,4.548387096774194
