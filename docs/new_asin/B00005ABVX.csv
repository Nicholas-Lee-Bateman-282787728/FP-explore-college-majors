This is a new medium and should be exploited to the fullest.  With that said, the DVD SHOULD include all the U2 video clips from 1980-1990 (A Celebration, Gloria, Two Hearts Beat as One...); commentary tracks with the band & manager looking back on their previous work; 16x9 enhancement; closed captioning for the lyrics; outtake footage/unreleased material, etc.  Of course, you and I both know it will not.
