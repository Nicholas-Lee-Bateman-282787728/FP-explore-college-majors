364368,4,6301798066,"In this western drama set immediately after the Civil War (originally titled ""The Reno Brothers""), Elvis appears in the secondary role of Clint Reno. This was the only time in his acting career that Elvis received second billing. Clint, the younger of the four Reno brothers, stayed behind to run the family farm during the war while his older brothers were off fighting for the Confederacy. Star Richard Egan plays Vance Reno, the elderst brother whom the family believes to have been killed in battle. Upon returning home, Vance is shocked to discover that Clint has married Vance's former sweetheart, Cathy, played by Debra Pagent (who appeared in The Ten Commandments). The love triangle, complicated by the greedy actions of some unscrupulous ex-Confederates, eventually pits brother against brother, resulting in Clint's death. The downbeat ending is tempered by the brother's reconciliation as Clint dies in Cathy's arms.
Originally titled ""The Reno Brothers"", this western drama was re-titled after a number of articles announced that advanced sales for ""Love Me Tender""--one of the songs recorded for the film--exceeded a million copies. It was the first time advanced sales for a single release had ever suprassed the million mark, and the producers capitalized on the publicity by changing the film's title.
The enormous amount of press coverage also affected the film's conclusion. During production, fanzines leaked that Elvis's character was supposed to die near the end of the film. As originally shot, the final scene features Mother Reno solemnly ringing the dinner bell as her three remaining sons toil in the fields. Pain and loss are registered on the faces of Mother Reno and Cathy, who mourn the death of Clint. Elvis's legion of fans were disturbed by the news that their idol was to be killed off in his first film and caused such a commotion that Twentieth Century-Fox shot an alternative ending in which Clint is spared. For reasons known only to the producers the second ending was rejected. Instead a third version of the ending was used and Clint is killed as called for in the original script, but the final shot superimposed a ghostly close-up of Elvis as Clint crooning ""Love Me Tender"" as his family slowly walks away from his grave. Hence the fans were then left with a final image of Elvis doing what he was famous for--singing.
The same promotion surrounding Love Me Tender that generated excitement among the fans also generated loathing among the critics. Many were brutal in their assessment of Elvis's performance, particulary Time Magazine, comparing Elvis's acting and screen presence to that of a sausage, a ""Walt Disney Goldfish"", a corpse, and a cricket--all in the same brief review.
If Elvis cried over the mean-spirited reviews, then he cried all the way to the bank. The film recouped its production costs within three days of release, guaranteeing that Elvis's Hollywood future would be lucrative.
Produced for Twentieth Century Fox by David Weisbart. Released November 15, 1956. B&W.",1027987200,20,3034,5.118951612903226
364369,3,6301798066,"THIS IS ELVIS' FIRST MOVIE. IT IS NOT TO BAD AN EFFORT. ELVIS LOOKS OUT OF PLACE WITHIN THE STORY-LINE. A CIVIL WAR MELODRAMA. HE SINGS AND MOVES AS ELVIS IN 1956. WHICH IS AWSOME IN OF IT'S SELF. HIS ACTING IS AMAZINGLY GOOD FOR BEING AN AMATOUR. ON THIS RELEASE THERE IS NOTHING ADDED IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. JUST A TRAILER. TYPICAL OF PARAMOUNT, WHO SEEMS TO HAVE A DISDAIN FOR ELVIS. THE TRANSFER IS CLEAN BUT IT COULD BE BETTER. AFTER ALL IT IS A BLACK AND WHITE FILM. JUST SEE WHAT CRITERION DID FOR ""THE BANK DICK"". THIS WAS AN HISTORIC MOMENT IN POP CULTURE THAT SHOULD'VE RECEIVED A LITTLE CARE. PARAMOUNT EVEN PUT A PICTURE ON THE COVER OF ELVIS IN THE 60'S!. HOW LAME IS THAT.?

364370,4,6301798066,"""Love Me Tender"" is a WHOLE lot better than I thought it would be. It is a very well-done movie. It may not be the absolute, hands-down best Elvis movie, but it ranks highly on the list. It has a good cast, Richard Egan, Debra Paget, etc. The movie is set right after the Civil War, so the songs couldn't be ""rock-n'roll"", so the movie has country-type songs, and of course, ""Love Me Tender"". I also appreciate how he's singing these songs on the front porch with his guitar or singing at a benefit to raise money for building a schoolhouse(all very logical and natural settings to be singing in, as opposed to breaking out in song with an invisible orchestra behind you when you're riding horses or something.) It is well-acted, and has an interesting plot, enough to keep you interested. See this movie. It's worth the time.",1016150400,6,826,4.550335570469799
364371,4,6301798066,"If there was an award for the strangest Elvis Presley film. My vote will go to Love Me Tender. For 3 reasons. A. He doesn't have the lead part. B. His chacater in this movie is married. C. This has a different ending than other Elvis Presley films. As Love Me Tender opens, it is April 10th 1865. The North fighters are happy that Lee has quit bring the war to the end. But some fighers doesn't know that the war is over. Including a fighter named Vince Reno (Ricard Egan). He finds out. So he makes plans to go back to Texas and marry his girlfiend named Cathy (Debra Paget). He and his brtohers, Brett and Ray has joined the war. But the youngest Reno brother named Clint (Elvis Presley in his film debut) has stayed home. Vince doesn't know that his family at home thinks he is dead. But he finds out. And his pa was killed at home and Cathy has moved in with Clint and his mom. Vince finds that out to. But he doesn't know yet that Clint has married Cathy. Vince finds out that his family thinks he is dead. Because a letter came to Clint and his mom that Vince died in the war....

364372,3,6301798066,"An otherwise forgettable black-and-white western that has achieved immortality as the film debut of a rock and roll singer of some note.  There isn't any rock and roll on the soundtrack, but the kid with the  sideburns and the curled lip belts out a quartet of nifty country flavored  songs, including ""Love Me Tender,"" a charming ditty that looked  to be so popular that the folks at 20th Century Fox dumped the original  title (""The Reno Brothers"") and renamed the film in the song's  honor.  Their instincts were correct about the song and the movie:  both  were monster hits.  The critics were not too enthused, especially about  that new guy's performance, but he's actually pretty good.  And no matter  what anyone thought, the singer kept on singing and making movies, too.  ""Love Me Tender"" is no classic, but it didn't need to be either.  It achieved its purpose (to make a mint for its studio, and to send the  image of its star to fans around the world) very well.",928281600,3,975,4.647058823529412

Directed by Robert D. Webb.

Singer, Elvis Presley's first film at the age of 21.

It is April 10, 1865. At the Greenwood train depot, the military officers receive a telegram General Lee has surrendered. The war is over. However, a posse of men on horseback apparently don't know this and try to out run a train. Once they reach the depot, The rebels start fighting the officers. Vince Reno (Richard Egan) and his gang shoot some officers and steal their clothes to pose as officers when the train comes. The gang steals the payroll from one of the boxes delivered from the train. The conductor finds a dead body in the train station. Now he has figured it out. The train makes a get away.
  Vance and his men make off with $12,250. They want to split the money, but then Vance decides to give it to General Randall. The next day, when they come across some confederate soldiers walking, Vance is told the war is over. Since Vance has discovered the camp is gone, he decides to keep the money. He wants to marry this girl, Cathy (Debra Paget), back at home. He has been gone for 4 years. When he arrives home, he finds out his father was killed and some other shocking news, his younger brother, Clint (Elvis Presley), has already married Cathy.

had thrown a soda at the screen while viewing the movie....and so when I attended a showing, the soda stain was very
evident throughout the movie. It was Presley's first movie....people laughed...I just watched.  But I never attended another
movie of his again.  It wasn't a terrible movie...they surrounded him with good character actors.....Richard Egan, James Drury,
L.Q Jones...but he was definitely the main attraction.  And he was exploited for all his worth!  The singing was pleasant, but
the shaking....well, when shown on the Ed Sullivan Show, he was only shown from the waist up.  Don't believe anyone would have sung songs accompanied by gyrating and shaking in 1865.  Very distracting.  The story should have been the focus, but
it wasn't.  Elvis Presley was the focus...and of all his movies....this one was the better one.  the talents of the others were
simply wasted.  It should have been, and would have been, a good movie had they allowed it to be so.",1398729600,,1088,4.858695652173913

364632,3,6301798066,"Elvis became a film star with his debut performance in Love Me Tender.  It was a shocking role for the musical sensation, mostly because he has some questionable (at least as far as fans were concerned) character arcs towards the end, so much so that fans demanded a different ending (and kind of got it).  The film itself is decent at best; a war themed western that has a love triangle at the core and some ethical play with regards to the main characters bout with the army, some stolen money and his decision to follow the law.  The acting is decent, and Presley delivers an admirable performance that paved the way for him to carve out a niche for himself.  He wasn't a very polished actor, but he made it work and gave his fans what they wanted.  The biggest shock here is that Love Me Tender was not a contender for Oscars Original Song.  In fact, the fact that Elvis was NEVER nominated for a single song he wrote for his countless films is odd, since they were all very good (at least mostly) and he was such a star.",1397433600,,1025,4.3125

For me, it brings memories back of a long-ago trek into Manhattan with my family to see Elvis up there on The Big Screen! What an event! I was quite young, but old enough to realize I was seeing something (and someone) quite special.

It was a lifetime ago, but I still recall a young lady sitting in front of us at the Paramount Theater yelling out, ""Oh, Elvis... Please don't die, Elvis!"" That was the impact he had on us in Love Me Tender, and it's the impact he had on us all his life.

Love Me Tender is not to be missed, and most definitely belongs in the collection of any Elvis fan. For us, The King never will die.",1254182400,,777,4.173333333333333
364861,5,6301798066,"Thursday, November 15th, 1956, was a rather interesting occasion; because, it was on this date that the educational system of New York City suffered a very unusual setback. It seems as though thousands of young teenage girls who had attended classes that very morning had suddenly vanished; like they had just disappeared off the face of the earth. Well, what the school authorities did not know that the young girls did know about was that they had snuck off to the historic Paramount movie theater in the heart of Times Square in New York to be among the first to actually witness a screening of Elvis Presley's very first feature film debut. A very large cardboard cut-out was seen placed atop of the theater's marquee, covered by a sheet of canvas. When the canvas was removed, the image revealed was that of Elvis Presley, smiling while strumming his guitar. Naturally, the girls all went crazy when this happened. This was an elaborate publicity scheme masterminded by Elvis' manager Col. Tom Parker. Originally released during the 1956 Thanksgiving holiday season, ""Love Me Tender"" quickly recovered its 1-and-a-half million dollar investment costs within less than three days in the cinemas. This was not only Elvis' screen debut; it was also the first and only time in his film career in which he recieved co-star billing. The movie was originally titled ""The Reno Brothers"". However, due to the rise in Elvis' overwhelming popularity, the studio decided to change the film's title. This was intended to capatalize on the film's title song, which eventually became another number one hit for Presley. The movie itself wound up becoming the second-highest grossing film of the year 1956, behind ""Giant"" starring Rock Hudson and James Dean. Elvis would follow this film with 3 more during the 50s: ""Loving You"", ""Jailhouse Rock"" and ""King Creole"". Shortly thereafter, he would go on to serve a 2-year stint in the United States Army overseas in Germany. Elvis himself had a very unique on-screen presence that helped to make him one of the most original personalities in the history of popular entertainment. Many people have thoroughly enjoyed his film career, which spans a total of 33 motion pictures. ""Love Me Tender"" is a truly classic movie with a brilliant stand-out performance from Elvis Presley, highlighted by 4 songs on the film's soundtrack. If you are a fan of the king, then this is one film event that you will most definitely enjoy. His 4 films from the 50s are considered perhaps his very best, and this is where it all started.",1245283200,14,2553,4.93953488372093
364862,3,6301798066,"Why 20th Century Fox felt that starring him in a Western would be successful is merely academic... When Elvis broke into gyrations and song, audiences were electrified...

The story--filmed in black-and-white CinemaScope-- was about a bunch of Confederate soldiers who stole a Union Army payroll and then discover that, just five days ago, Lee had surrendered to Grant at Appomattox, ending the Civil War...

Hiding the money, The Reno brothers (Richard Egan, William Campbell, and James Drury) decide to use it for themselves, and return home to the family farm and their kid brother Clint...

Presley was cast as a Texas farm boy who marries his cavalry-man brother's sweetheart when news of his brother's death filters through... But the brother--played by Richard Egan isn't dead at all and incurs Presley's jealousy by resuming his friendship with his former sweetheart the beautiful Cathy Reno (Debra Paget)... The situation went from bad to worse...

In his first motion picture, Elvis proved to be a rugged fighting man, a wonderful loving man and a terrific singing man... Hear him sing: ""Let Me,"" ""We're Gonna Move,"" ""Poor Boy,"" and ""Love Me Tender.""",1233792000,,1160,5.154255319148936

364909,5,6301798066,"Love Me Tender is, by far, my favorite Elvis movie.  Yes, Elvis sings but it is the storyline that clinches my 5 star rating.
Elvis plays Clint Reno, the youngest of his brothers who stays behind to tend the family farm while the others go off to fight in the Civil War.  The family receives word that the oldest brother, Vance (played by a very handsome Richard Egan) is killed.  Cathy, Vance's love, has lost her family in the war and now that Vance is killed, she has no one. Clint marries her and believes that she loves him the way in which he loves her.  He does not realize that her heart still belongs to Vance.
Their lives are forever changed when Vance along with his brothers, reappears.  He is intent upon marrying Cathy, of spending the rest of his life with her.  He soon finds out that she is not free.  She is now Clint's wife.  Shattered and heartbroken, he conceals his feelings from his younger brother.  Yet, he cannot contain the overwhelming love he has for Cathy.  Nor can Cathy remain so indifferent. Knowing that Clint will soon discover the feelings they still have for each other, he makes plans to go away.  But Fate intervenes.
One reckless act during the war jeopardizes Vance's future. He and his fellow soldiers have taken money.  Money that has been traced back to them.  They are ordered to return it or face prison.  Vance and his brothers agree to this intent upon finding the other members of his troop that took part in this robbery.
Unexpectedly, Clint meets up with the members of Vance's troop and learns the horrible truth.  Vance had always loved Cathy.  Had longed to marry her.  He believes that he was played for a fool and his jealousy and anger escalate causing him to act rashly.
Love Me Tender is an excellant story.  This isn't a musical nor does Elvis sing in every scene.  The plot is tightly woven with sadness, betrayal, jealousy and a love that will not be denied.
Beforwarned, the ending isn't happily-ever-after.  Elvis does die yet I believe that there could have been no other ending.  He could never have made Cathy happy especially once Vance came back.  With every glance she cast his way, the longing was there in her eyes.  And this he knew . . .

364911,4,6301798066,Good movie worthy of any western collection as well as Elvis collection. Again for those who don't think Elvis had talent to act this first movie showed what could have been developed. The death scene is good. Good movie for the whole family.,1043971200,,242,4.651162790697675
364912,5,6301798066,"""Love Me Tender"" was a complete success when it first came to theaters November 15, 1956. The love triangle in this story is one-in-a-million! Elvis does such good acting in this picture that some fans could consider it his finest acting...and it's only his first movie! Elvis does four songs in the picture: ""We're Gonna Move"", ""Love Me Tender"", ""Let Me"", and ""Poor Boy."" Although ""Love Me Tender"" is set after the Civil War the songs Elvis sings are closely related to rock'n'roll. Very disappointing when Elvis' character dies near the end. Elvis' mother did not like that at all. I cried when Elvis' character dies, and after the family walks solemnly away from his grave there is a ghostly close-up of Elvis singing ""Love Me Tender."" I was shocked, and cried at this! Elvis fans, if you want something a little more uplifting, try ""Loving You."" Elvis didn't like when he did the songs in ""Love Me Tender"" because his band wasn't there with him on-screen.",1036713600,6,959,4.748502994011976
364913,4,6301798066,"Ok I'm no big fan of Elvis, I know his music, (an American can't help but know it.)  Its good music, but I don't own a song of his.  I don't claim to be a follower of his movies either, but this one is a western and I AM a follower of westerns and Civil War movies and this passes well.
  This movie brings it highs and lows.  A trio of brothers fresh from a raid of a Union payroll find out that the war is over on their way to turn in the money to their General with the unit.  Their commander Vance (the eldest brother) decides there is no Confederate Government to turn the cash in to.  They split the dough and head home.  The family gets a shock that they are alive when they were told they were dead, while he gets a shock which the girl we was to marry is wed to his younger brother (Elivs).
  The plot twists when the Union army decides that to come after the former raiders, causing splits among the raiders and increasing the tension between the brothers.  The movie is more than passable (should likely be 3 3/4 stars vs 4's) and the acting is pretty good and the story moves along well.
  As far as Elvis goes, this movie proves he can act.  Its a shame that we don't see him in later years in more conventional movies such as this one.  This picture convinces me he could carry it off well.  Sinatra was able to pull off movies that were seperate from his singing, (although he did a fair amount of ""singing"" movies.) its a shame Elvis never got that chance.",1034640000,25,1472,4.130281690140845
