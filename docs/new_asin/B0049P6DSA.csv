8419191,5,B0049P6DSA,"I just finished watching the entire series to date (1 through 16). A relative in England brought me the complete set as a gift, ordered directly from the BBC (thank you, Connie!). The acting, plot lines, characters, and filming are top notch -- each episode is better than most offerings in the cinema at present. I liked Amanda Burton in the first few, but loved Emilia Fox in all the rest. The stories are gripping, suspense-filled and often grim, but the main characters always provide heart and at times a light touch. I even love the haunting theme music. I hope the complete series becomes available in region 1 format as a box set (are you hearing this, Amazon?), so that U.S. audiences get the chance to see it. One of of the very best of the British TV imports -- I can't recommend it enough.",1389312000,,801,4.493150684931507
