3952893,5,B002MWO7X0,This movie is a great addition to my library. I recently read a book about Rin Tin Tin and it was fun to see the original.,1332028800,6,122,3.730769230769231
3952894,4,B002MWO7X0,"""Where the North Begins"" is of interest for two reasons.  The first is that it is the earliest known film to feature Rin Tin Tin, not the character, but the actual dog found by a U.S. G. I. in France during World War I.  The second reason is that it is an entertaining gem from the era of the silent screen.

This is the story of a dog that is lost while being transported across Alaska and Canada and is adopted by a pack of wolves.  When Rin Tin Tin meets Gabrielle (sic) it has to choose between the wolves and a human companion.  The viewer eagerly follows as the tale of crime and love unfolds.  Rin Tin Tin is the real hero of the show, not only because of his bravery, but also in his acting which displays almost human qualities.

Sure the camera work is primitive and the lack of dialogue forces the viewer to use his imagination, but that is the charm of it.  Frequent writings on the screen enable the viewer to follow the story. In contrast to the high tech contemporary productions, ""Where the North Begins"" takes the viewer back to the delightful early days of cinema.

An added feature is ""Hustling for Health"", a short silent comedy starring Stan Laurel.  It needs no dialogue.  Just watch it and laugh.",1329004800,14,1219,4.373333333333333
3952895,4,B002MWO7X0,"As a long- time German Shepherd admirer and having owned many of the breed over the years, and after reading the recent book by Susan Orleans on Rin Tin Tin, the most celebrated canine  movie  hero of all time, I just had to order his first and most famous movie - from 1923!  I was not disappointed.  This  movie is surprisingly well- shot and not a bit sentimental and the viewing quality is very good.  I recommend it to any Shepherd lover - or doglover for that matter.",1326240000,18,473,4.318181818181818
8374119,5,B002MWO7X0,"Excellent movie for GSD lovers.  For millennials, you will need to think back to what life was like in the upper northwest in the 1880's/early 1900's to ""get"" this movie.  Still, classic German Shepherd, and the editor and producer clearly showcase the courage, intelligence and loyalty of the breed.  Some of the clips of Rin Tin Tin show brutally what is like to be alone/lost in a blizzard and facing what seems like insurmountable challenges.

Another ""heads up"":  The first 10 minutes or so, it is mostly domestic scenes of humans, but pay attention because it sets the movie, and explains where Rinty's loyalties lie and why.

If you have ever been in a blizzard in the upper northwest, and are a GSD lover, you will ""get"" this movie.  Given that this was produced back in the 1920's, with very few resources in the upper Northwest, the production on this must have been a huge labor of love for the GSD breed.

Comparison to ""Adventures of Rex and Rin Tin Tin""

I watched the ""Adventures of Rex and Rin Tin Tin"" (with Arabian Horse ""Rex"") (1935) with my dog, before watching ""Where the North Begins"".  Adventures of Rex and Rin Tin Tin had audio, whereas ""Where the North Begins (1923) - no audio, just subtitles.  So in the ""Adventures of Rex and Rin Tin Tin, when he whined or barked like my dog does, it was entertaining for both of us.

I actually liked the ""Adventures of Rex and Rin Tin Tin"", but other reviewer on Amazon have not.  In that movie, I loved the friendship between horse and dog that the producers portrayed, and the courage of Rinty that is classic GSD.

A big contrast between the two movies is that, to have been basically stranded in blizzard conditions to shoot all of the shots of ""Where The North Begins"" in the early 1920's, you realize all of the challenges it must have taken to shoot it.  They likely had to pack things in, in conditions most people would not be out in.  By 1935, however, when the later Rin Tin TIn movies were made (obviously a different dog), there were a lot more resources available.  So the producers just even attempting ""Where The North Begins"" is a huge feat.",1508025600,,2123,4.530183727034121
8374120,4,B002MWO7X0,Just delighted to have such a rare treat in my collection. Hours of anticipation. Now I need to save for a Power Converter for my Region One player.,1470614400,,148,4.321428571428571

8374122,1,B002MWO7X0,DVD arrived with severely damaged case.  I want the movie but it sucks that amazon can't give partial credit when product arrives damaged.  I even provided them pictures.  Had 2 DVD arrives like this.,1414281600,,200,4.823529411764706
8374123,5,B002MWO7X0,"great movie, Rin Tin Tin (the original one ) is both beautiful and amazing as an actor!",1404777600,,87,4.176470588235294
8374124,5,B002MWO7X0,Rin Tin Tin does his stuff in this non-stop action flick that once again pulled Warner Brothers out of the red.  Again!,1391904000,,119,4.409090909090909
8374125,4,B002MWO7X0,"This is the movie Lee Duncan (the guy who found and trained Rinty) wrote for his special dog.  These early Rin Tin Tin movies are rough to watch and understand; but before you slam the film quality consider how well you'll be looking and sounding after eighty years and no preservation.

It's a children's action movie made by a bunch of guys with an amazing dog and a couple cameras.  I love these movies.  I'm handicapped and travel with a German Shepherd service dog.  Decades after the TV show's re-runs left the air I still hear parents telling their children ""Look, there's Rin Tin Tin"".",1389052800,3,593,4.609523809523809
8374126,5,B002MWO7X0,"For those that have been intrigued by the Rin-Tin-Tin described in the book by Susan Orlean, this is a great movie that illustrates the incredible nature of this dog. There is also a certain charm in watching an old silent movie from a long gone era and a much simpler time in society. This is also one of the only surviving original films of this great dog. Sit back and enjoy.",1363651200,7,378,4.338028169014085
8374127,5,B002MWO7X0,"Nothing beats the original Rin-tin-tin!  Unlike Lassie and Benji, Rinty is more than a pretty face - he actually moves the action in the movie.  The human actors are pretty good, too!",1361318400,,183,4.6875
8374128,5,B002MWO7X0,"This is the oldest surviving Rin Tin Tin Movie. As usual Rin Tin Tin is the best actor by far in this movie. He is the star and gives a good performance. All of his movies follow a successful story line of him being falsely accused and redeeming himself. He is not to be confused with Rin Tin Tin Junior or other variations such as TV programs. He is an aggressive and dynamic star, who comes to the rescue with energy.",1361059200,3,419,4.185185185185185
