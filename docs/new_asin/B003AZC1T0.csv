8393313,5,B003AZC1T0,"Please read the editorial review above of the product description.  This version WILL NOT PLAY in a US Region 1 player.  You will need a region-free player in order to play this Region 2 set released from the UK.

This 13 disc set is only of the 1965-66 ""hour long episodes"" and does NOT contain the ""half hour"" long episodes from 1961.  The 2014 American re-release [of A&E's ""Secret Agent aka Danger Man""] from SHOUT! FACTORY contains both series.  So, why would anyone in the US want this set (presuming that they owned a region-free player)?

Mostly for the plethora of extras in this set!

Network's incredible HD masters were used for A&E's Blu-ray release of ""The Prisoner"" & its DVD re-release in 2009, so their reputation for quality precedes them.  I'm not sure if these B&W episodes of Danger Man/Secret Agent have been remastered, but the episodes from the old A&E release (""Secret Agent aka Danger Man"") looked good.  The episodes on this Network release look great, but that could be due to the PAL conversion on my region-free player.

Regarding EXTRAS:  This UK release is from the British firm NETWORK.  It does NOT contain the extras from the 2014 North American SHOUT! FACTORY release (Audio Commentaries with Writer Brian Clemens and Director Peter Graham Scott & an Interview with Catherine McGoohan).  The only extras on the original North American A&E release were the Johnny Rivers opening credits and a text filmography of Patrick McGoohan.  FYI

However, this UK version is loaded with many other extras (listed below), including the feature-length version of KOROSHI!  This is not an extended version of the episode itself, but a ""movie"" made by combining both color episodes.  The ending of the KOROSHI episode was truncated and a 4-minute bridge added to link that episode to the episode SHINDA SHIMA, making it ""feature-length"".

If you are a huge fan of The Prisoner or a McGoohan ""completist"", the price of a region-free DVD player is worth it to be able to own/view all of these extras, which were absent from the original A&E releases in the US and are also NOT on the 2014 US release from SHOUT! FACTORY (which instead has the commentaries listed above & the Catherine McGoohan interview).

The text below is from NETWORK's web page listing for this product:

""A runaway success for ITC in the 1960s, Danger Man originally started as a half-hour series before hitting its stride with a transition to the fifty-minute format. This set contains all 47 fifty-minute shows (the last two in colour), charting the exploits of John Drake  an exemplary agent for British Intelligence who is sent into situations too tricky or dangerous for normal spies to undertake. McGoohans simmering, compelling performance catapulted him into movies and paved the way for his undeniable tour de force  The Prisoner.

""Danger Man features intriguing stories from top writers such as Ralph Smart, Donald Jonson, Philip Broadley and Tony Williamson, complemented by direction from stalwarts of the filmed action series genre such as Charles Crichton, Michael Truman, Peter Yates, Don Chaffey and even McGoohan himself. Showcasing all the hallmarks of the very best filmed ITC series, Danger Man features exceptional performances rom guest stars such as Ian Hendry, Dawn Addams, Virginia Maskell, Warren Mitchell, Sylvia Syms, Glyn Owen and Donald Houston.
