Smokie Brannaman is one of the two most knowledgable horseman alive today, the other is his brother Buck Brannaman. This is an excellent training tool for any rider or trainer/horseman, unless ofcourse if you don't understand horses and obviously don't understand that a horse is an extension of yourself. There is NEVER a situation that is perfect, accept the chickens (not birds) and put this DVD set at the top of your list for purchase!!! VACOWGURL-MT",1353283200,,585,5.104166666666667

Got thru day 1&2 on 1st disc that was all I could take.  This will be thrown on the ""not going to watch"" pile of DVD's  Don't waste ur money  not very useful aside from all the chirping noise.",1347667200,,319,4.096774193548387
