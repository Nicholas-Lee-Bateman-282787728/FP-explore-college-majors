2653897,5,B000I8OOQ0,"The trans parts may seem a bit dated, but are still of value, if only for documenting how trans issues have been articulated by transpeople throughout the past few decades. The bondage segment is the most artfully shot of the four vignettes, though sadly does become the film's weak point, and drags on a bit longer than necessary. The bit with Annie Sprinkle is eye opening, but on some level, once the shock wears off, you need theory to provide you with lasting value. The first bit with Camille Paglia was the most interesting, and could well justify the rest of the doc entirely (assuming  you enjoy the theoretical aspects it delves into)",1405987200,,644,4.699115044247788

8144433,5,B000I8OOQ0,"for those who think and for those who hold to the belief that a more sexually open society is a healthy one, this is a fantastic series of short films and interviews that, as it was recorded in 1992, is both vastly ahead of it's time, and tragic in that we still haven't progressed enough fully as a society to be able to fully embrace or recognize this for the brilliance and eye opening views that it showcases. but watching this reminds me of one very real fact, and that is this: we are getting there, things are getting better. this film showcases a few of the people who are driving the cause of human and societal betterment. each woman in this film deserves nothing but praise, and i am very grateful to have watched this. if you're a thoughtful person who genuinely cares about other people, you will be too.",1423526400,,817,4.417218543046357

8144436,3,B000I8OOQ0,"Dated, poorly named, and the Instant Video version has only four short films, rather than the five advertised.

Rather than being a single movie, this is a collection of four different short films by Monika Treut, each essentially independent of and unrelated to each other:

* An interview with Camilla Paglia
* An interview (of sorts) with Annie Sprinkle (nee Ellen Steinberg)
* An interview with a woman discussing her interest in S&M and bondage
* An interview with a transgender man, originally born as a woman

I found all of the interviews interesting to some extent. Paglia's is probably the most interesting, if for no other reason than her views are the most intellectualized and so are expressed more successfully in the interview format.

Sprinkle is mainly discussing why she enjoys dressing up, the positive way it makes her feel. But the segment also touches briefly (no pun intended) on Sprinkle's efforts to demystify sexuality, and the female body in particular.

The interviews discussion bondage and transgender issues were probably more illuminating when originally made. With the advent of the Internet information about all kinds of things, including sexuality, flows more freely and people have broader exposure to alternative lifestyles and issues, even if those lifestyles or issues are inapplicable. And no doubt the intervening years have brought advances in transgender surgeries, making that interview at least somewhat out-of-date. Still, I'm sure there are people for whom these interviews offer new and interesting information.

My biggest complaint (and it's not that big) has to do with the name of the collection. ""Female Misbehavior"" is just way off. I guess in some contexts, these women might be considered to be misbehaving. But only by the most judgmental of us. And I'm not sure those people will get the sarcasm implied in the title. Maybe there should've been quotes around the word ""Misbehavior""? Anyway, I think the title might attract viewers looking for something different, and will fail to attract those who would actually appreciate the interviews.",1411084800,2,2099,5.232142857142857
8144437,1,B000I8OOQ0,"When this came out in 1992 it may have had some sort of relevance, but now, some 22 years later it's pretty dated and not in a good way. Technically I found the video to be grainy and the sound often muddy and indistinct. The interviews are not all that interesting. Maybe a film historian or some sort of sociologist will find this interesting; I certainly didn't.",1409961600,,365,4.462686567164179

Didn't bother with other two - third one was perverse, last one seemed kind of disgusting.  Watch Camille, bag the rest - they don't even belong in the same show.",1408924800,,320,4.925925925925926
