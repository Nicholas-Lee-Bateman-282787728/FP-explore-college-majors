6247978,4,B00I30MQ4W,I really appreciated this movie. Acting was great. The thought experiments were interesting. The destruction of the the final scenario to put the instructor in his place was a bit much though. Overall I liked it but can't give it 5.

6247984,1,B00I30MQ4W,"What's more awful than this movie: the fact that so many other reviewers, who also hated the movie, never questioned the assumptions of its premise.

Who really believes that occupational skills and fertility would be valued so exclusively above all other traits and without any regard to personal traits, physical abilities, social skills or interpersonal dynamics? Familiarity and shared affinity? What about resilience? Sense of humor? Ability to get along with others? Dependability, initiative and courage? Communication skills? Problem-solving abilities and resourcefulness?

Who do you choose to associate with in your daily life? Who do you pick for your team when you want to create something?

You choose people you know and like, people who share your values, people you can trust, people you can rely on, who show up and contribute, people who are a good fit.

6248000,3,B00I30MQ4W,"Decent acting, lovely vistas, sometimes interesting conceptually this movie could certainly be called good if you ignored three critical flaws:

Ive never studied philosophy, but isn't a thought experiment still a type of experiment? Which means, to test a hypothesis (or, as they said in the movie, a premise) the design should be simple enough to eliminate confounding variables (rather than tempting confounding human nature to emerge, lel). One might reasonably suspect the teacher has ulterior motives, but does a philosopher-of all people-choose to exploit their own field/students instead of finding a creative solution? Or is his avidity a lie? Flaw 1: MC spends most of the movie OOC

Flaw 2: the kids are secretly stupid The movie follows a class of high school students, whom were led to believe are exceptionally bright, into some surprising conundrums: e.g., they will die in a nuclear bunker if they cant figure out a 5-digit numerical password. Oh no! 100,000 combinations, whatever shall we do? To make matters worse, if they don't know the code is 5-digit, they might have to try up to 111,110 combinations! Cant divide that into 100 shifts to reduce the risk of mistakes it'd be asking too much from high schoolers who can craft a harp out of engine parts or whatever. Golly gee, they might have even finished a couple days before they had to cannibalize each other

Flaw 3: if by scenario two you don't strongly suspect the high school teacher of wanting to sleep with one of his students, you aren't paying attention. Glaring evidence borne in mind, the ending will seriously disappoint you.

Spoilers: So the issue in 3 is similar to issue 1: Im betting morality is well within a philosophers purview; in fact morality is probably the most complex and interesting thing for a philosophers mind to contemplate. And yet he has the morality of a fifth grader no wonder she chose the dumb blonde who got into Cornell. ...She's supposedly very smart too, and yet she lacks the miniscule amt of foresight required to realize that she'll eventually doubt she earned her A+ the old-fashioned academic way.

This was just stupid, it needs to be one way or the other, movie about some stupid class project or a movie about what the title says it was supposed to be.

Instead of the group coming to a cogent process for making decisions, it came down to whims.  The acting, for the most part was very convincing and realistic.  However, the philosophy, reason and logic of the director and writer was obvious, they are all dead.

The ending is not clever, well done or thought out.

Once they got to round 3 of trying to survive this  theoretical apocalyptic experiment  Petra just becomes  ridiculous. She pick a group of people for mostly entertainment, who are artsy or if you are gay.
The whole story leans way to far left for me. These kids are spoiled, entitled and there morals are completely distorted. The teacher Mr. Zimit is creepy.
It was painful to finish the movie but I did out of principle. That is a 107 minutes of my life I will never get back.

I did love the idea of resetting between different end of world scenarios and the task of choosing the group of survivors for a bunker based on their skills and justifying the reasonings. Unfortunately the characters were a forgettable, with no notable performances or scenes that make this movie worth a second thought. The way the female protagonist made a final choice of people based on having a nice time before they die and basically dooming the human race ruined the movie for me. They ended the survival theme with a suicidal solution, and pretty much laid to waste the entire momentum of the plot.

If she was only smart and not beautiful, would he still be as infatuated? Once she matured and solidified her opinions and world view past the time of youth and inexperience, would that infatuation persist or find a new ""perfect"" student to meet his fantasy. I give the movie 3 stars because it was interesting and visually pleasant (although overdone at times) but I think the message to most would be about the girl being manipulative and destructive to the teacher vs. the teacher having perverted views and no credible morality. Can we just stop making different versions of Lolita?

So simple. There's several examples of these supposedly intelligent people just giving into their situation and not putting up a fight.

Finally an apocalyptic scenario, without zombies and dystopia!  The theme is explored by an international philosophy class.  Via 3 thought  experiments by 20 highly intelligent students.  They have to determine who will live and who will die, and why because there is only room in the bunker and supplies for ten people for one year.  When they emerge their sole goal is to rebuild the human race.

I had issues with some of the decisions they made when they involved issues like sexual preference and religion. Therefore loading the bunker with males that refused to sleep with women wouldn't be practical, in the real world.

I didn't give it five stars because the third scenario seemed to be an act of defiance and rebellion, based purely on emotion and not logic. The reason why teenagers shouldn't run the world because they do not have enough life experience to ever get it right.",1509235200,,966,4.674556213017752

I love philosophy and thought experiments, but this movie seemed to use thought experiements as a way to reveal more about the students in the classroom than about actually exploring thoughts and ideas during life-or-death situations. That can be okay, but it was not what I expected and it wasn't executed well. The real-life drama in the classroom caused the thought experiments to feel imbalanced, flawed, and ultimately rigged by the professor. The professor was a wild card, an agent of chaos, which has some use and is realistic in end-of-the-world situations, but his presentation of elements and his actions in the scenarios reduced the power of his desire for the students to rely on reason and logic to survive and instead put the teacher in a position to introduce whatever elements he wanted in order to prevent any successful outcome no matter what. The teacher is an a$$hole who I did not like and the ending was dumb.

Though honestly, how seemingly easily the closeted gay student came out to the class is probably the most unrealistic part of the whole movie, lol. Few closeted people would so easily out themselves, especially when being cajoled by other students no matter how safe the space is. Coming out is hard and often dangerous and is usually not treated so nonchalantly. Maybe someday coming out will be easier...

6248070,2,B00I30MQ4W,"After the Dark (John Huddles, 2013)

After the Dark (also released under the title The Philosophers), John Huddles' first film in a decade and a half, starts out with an intriguing, sobering, and rather terrifying premise. Zimit (Exorcist: The Beginning's James D'Arcy) is a philosophy teacher at an Indonesian school containing some of the world's best and brightest students. It's the last day of his class' senior year, and he's not going to let them go without one last exercise. There are twenty students in the class, and Zimit makes twenty-one. A nuclear disaster has occurred, and they are within range of a bunker that can sustain ten people for one year, enough time for the radiation level on the planet to subside enough for it to become habitable again. Given a random distribution of talents (the students pick slips of paper from a box describing their professions), an exercise in pragmatism: who gets to go into the bunker? Who lives and who dies?
The execution starts off feeling somewhat cheesy, but is eventually absorbing; this is a mindgame, but it is a mindgame being played by the smartest guys in the room. It is perfectly believable that they would be able to immerse themselves so deeply into the game as to be able to visualize the scenes the way Huddles portrays them to us, as if they were actually happening, and to be able to take on the characters as deeply as they do. Would they really experience these existential crises that deeply? Yes, I believe they would, given their age and advanced mental ability. (All those nights we spent in college drinking massive quantities of alcohol and arguing about the world's problems as if we actually had a chance of solving them...)
And then everything goes to hell in a handbasket.
NOTE: the following paragraphs contain at least one minor spoiler regarding the setup of the film (I assume it was meant to be a twist). Proceed with caution as necessary.
I will admit right off that the first thing that rubbed me the wrong way about this film may not have been the fault of Huddles' script (he wrote as well as directed). There may have been other forces at work there, he may have done all kinds of research and interviewed hundreds of people. What would you do in this situation...? But if all that did occur, we don't see many signs of it. We just get, in the second iteration of this game, ten survivors who cling, as closely as possible, to the morality of today's society, and when one of the survivors throws a wrench into the works, noting that a quirk in the way things are going necessitates the formulation of a new morality, everything goes off the rails, leading to the utter destruction of that iteration. At least one character voices the kind of knee-jerk resistance to the idea in such a way, given the word choice, the background music, etc., that Huddles wants us to believe that choiceto cling to modern society's moral code on pain of deathis the right choice, and that the proposition of a new morality (coming from an ogre, basically) is the wrong one. Very little here in the way or moral ambiguity. Even if you agree that the choice is a correct oneand I will argue that to the ends of the earth with you, if you likeit fails the internal consistency check. Zimit's entire purpose in playing this game is to expose the students to the practical applications of philosophy, one aspect of which, traditionally, has been the rational analysis of moral ambiguity. Any teacher worth his salt would have failed the students involved immediately for descending into chaos and violence when forced with a choice that is, ultimately, as minor as that one was.
But the real failure lies in the final twenty or so minutes of the film. Huddles seems unconvinced that he has painted his characters in broad enough strokes to show us who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, so he throws in two related twists at the end that entirely hamstring everything he's tried to do up to that point. Was his goal there to provide a rationale for the bad guys' actions? To make the movie into more of a mystery than a thriller? To pad a script that wasn't quite long enough for the producers? We will never know, and to be honest, by the time that last bit of silliness had ended, despite the strength of the film's first half, I no longer cared enough to wonder about it for too long. **",1415923200,,4373,4.606410256410256

6248074,4,B00I30MQ4W,"Right after I saw this movie, I thought that, logically, this movie shouldn't have worked. But the director, the writer and the actors actually did it. They pulled a rabbit out of the hat. It also brought to mind something I've been saying for a long time, to wit, that there are some admirable teachers, there are some inspiring teachers, some bad teachers, and some very, very dangerous teachers.

It's the last day of school for an expatriate graduating class in Indonesia. The philosophy teacher has them go through a ""thought experiment"" in logic and reasoning. The setup is that there is a nuclear attack and there is a shelter available for 10 out of the 21 students. Each is given a random profession, from florist to doctor and the group must decide who lives or dies. The teacher is part of the group. The film then takes over as a ""live"" representation of the intense interpersonal and situational dynamics in the three different scenarios on location. As the scenarios progress, it becomes evident that the teacher is a cold blooded psychopath. The ending in the third scenario turns everything on its head.",1413417600,2,1119,4.7979274611398965
6248075,4,B00I30MQ4W,"It's pretty hard to come across a different way to tell a story as a movie these days, and when it's attempted there will always be those who don't like the new concept. After the Dark isn't a story about a group of young attractive people actually surviving an atomic war, instead it's a classroom of teenagers and their teacher role playing their discussion. The teacher discusses a few other moral questions before getting to the big one such as a tram is hurtling down the track, after a switch which you have time to get to and pull, on it's current course it will run over three people tied to the track, but you can divert it onto another track with just one person. Should you pull the lever? The big question and main point of the movie has the teacher asks the students to draw profile cards out of a box of characters with different occupations, which they will each become. They then also just happen to be next to an underground bunker, the bunker has enough food and oxygen for ten people to survive a year, there are twenty people in the group, plus the teacher who only tells them he's a wild card. Who should go into the bunker, being that the atomic war is global, and apart from a few other bunkers around the world, everyone else will likely perish?

This scenario is something most people will have done themselves, or will have to do at some time in their life so it's interesting to watch it as a movie. I've been to many job interviews where the first round of the process is a group interview, and you have to do a similar scenario such as you are on a sinking ship and have to decide who will get to go into the lifeboat. Of course usually who you save isn't the point, it's how you communicate with a bunch of strangers, are you too dominant, do you not speak up at all, if someone disagrees with you how do you behave and other stuff. Perhaps the teacher is doing this too but with this movie version the goal is obviously survival for the year and re-emerging from the bunker so the human race can continue.

I found the movie to be an interesting viewing experience. Just as enjoyable as more traditionally told movies. Sure it has its faults in their decisions, and even the exercise itself, but this is the case if you do these sorts of exercises in real life. It's up to participants to catch these and voice them and at times none of the kids in the movie do so, but then they are playing high school kids with the relevant life experience so this is very plausible.  Spoiler sentence - Such as how would you let in the person with the code if you don't know it anyway? The actors are obviously older than teenagers but what movie/TV show ever actually has teen aged actors playing teenagers? It's interesting as well that the movie is set in Indonesia, at an English speaking private school, yet the movie could have been set anywhere as being set there plays no role in the plot.

As others noted, the movie starts fairly well and with an interesting concept, albeit, not with much on the line -- someone's grade.  Will they get an A or an A+ in Philosophy 101?! Tell me more!  I am riveted!

So then begins the ""thought experiment"".  I must have missed that exercise while picking up my Philosophy minor, but I digress.  So with my belief suspended, I settled in and tried to enjoy it.

Frankly, I am an easy customer.  I am a huge fan of apocalyptic fiction, both in print and on film.  It often provides an excellent context for examining baser instincts and how someone reacts to a situation in which all standard societal norms are discarded.  Protagonists often find themselves thrust back into the state of nature, no longer bound (or protected) by a legal code.  What will they do?  How will their morals guide them?  Will they sacrifice their morals for survival?  How will they form new bonds?  Will they betray those close to them for an advantage?  Yes, many interesting questions.  This movie seems to answer a different one - how many Abercrombie models can you fit in a ridiculously impractical yet stylish bunker?

To say that things go down hill after a fairly decent start would be an understatement...made even worse by Sophie Lowe's painfully languid line delivery.  Was she stoned during the entirety of filming...or did the director actually think that her whispery monotone somehow made her character appear more thoughtful, intelligent, and deep?  Mark missed.

So ""fingernails on a blackboard"" line delivery aside, how was the story?  Well, suffice to say that the character development was so poor that I honestly didn't care who lived or died...or got an 'A'...or whatever.  I was just hoping that I would get out alive...and I seriously debated taking an ""incomplete"".

If you struggle through it for nearly two hours, you will be treated to a poorly contrived ending, masquerading as something meaningful...which is actually fairly representative of the entire movie, so in that respect, it's nice that they were consistent to the (bitter) end.",1404777600,8,2317,4.889460154241645

The plot assumes the event of a global nuclear war in which 20 highschool students are trying to decide who gets the right to live in a quarantined environment with only enough living space and resources designated for 10 persons for a span of one year.
The decision of who gets to stay and who gets culled from the herd is decided by classist and sexist decree. Once the tally is in, the others either get shot like cattle (to spare them from suffering in the wilderness) or they try to outrun their fate. Selection for living in the bunker is most preferential to females because they can breed and thus eventually re-populate the earth .. that is, after they leave the bunker when the food and air goes out.
No one ever factors in that even a year after worldwide nuclear detonation, life on earth would unbearable and so incredibly contaminated with radioactive waste that it would not be possible to survive.

The teacher acts psychopathic and not even the ending twist really explains the pure sadism he exercises on his students. (In the second act, I was expecting his secondary trait to literally be ""psychopath"" which would have explained his character, but they never even reveal his second trait.)

The thought experiments are too shallow for a real apocalypse.  An engineer is pointed out as being someone who 'builds things up"" and a soldier is billed as ""someone who knocks things down.""  Yet after an apocalypse, the idea of not having a soldier around is ludicrous, if for no other reason than for basic survival skills.  Also, they dismiss an astronaut because ""we won't be flying into space anytime soon,""  Like the deep thinkers they are, they ignore what it takes to get to a certain point in life. An astronaut is a resourceful, motivated person.  One who possesses multiple utilitarian skills and leadership capability and is trained to work in a hostile environment.  All these enlightened kids see is an astronaut.  Same goes for the soldier.

The fact that they want to keep a U.S. Senator with them ""because she knows the law"" (as if that's going to help) shows me the liberal bent of this show; World Destroyed? Call your Senator!

This film seems like a great idea. An exploration of basic philosophy and ethics through the visualization of thought experiments? Cool! But this is about philosophy in the way that 'Matrix Revolutions' was about philosophy: pretension, doublespeak, explosions, and electronica masquerading as deep thought.

In this movie, a couple dozen Abercrombie models in their mid-20s pretend to be actors pretending to be high school students (to be fair, some actually are actors). On the last day of Model School, their philosophy teacher springs a thought experiment on them: what if the world were ending and each of them had to decide which 10 people to save? The teacher (who can't make up his mind whether he's teaching logic, philosophy, ethics, Reader's Digest Brain Teasers, or brooding) might have been expected to introduce concepts like this before the last day, but hey.

Their thought experiment is then visualized and narrated (in its broad strokes) through three iterations in which the students -- and the audience -- become increasingly frustrated. The 'philosophy' 'discussion' is a train wreck of unexamined preconceptions, assumptions, and commitments that goes from bad to worse to utterly incoherent. Why is principled nonparticipation ruled out of court? Why does everyone (even the token religious guy) automatically go along with the materialist-utilitarian agenda without comment? Why is the only alternative to materialist utilitarianism presented as hedonistic narcissism? Why are people caught out on bad decisions based on information they couldn't possibly know or gain knowledge of? Why doesn't anyone notice that the professor is subverting the entire experiment by acting like a sociopath? Why does nobody notice that virtually everything the teacher does is framed in false dichotomies? Why is everyone cool with the teacher thought-experimenting the rape of one of his students at gunpoint? Why does the heroine turn out at the end to be a total creep who's leading her hapless, stupid boyfriend along? Why is so much of this movie devoted to the topic of sex with only the barest of comment on its philosophical significance?

This movie pretends that it's exploring the big questions, but it's not. It's a bunch of pretty people admiring some utterly shallow ideas. Don't waste your money, your time, or your mindspace.",1392336000,61,2587,5.302439024390244

8638542,4,B00I30MQ4W,"This movie has the feel of a television movie because its special effects seem rudimentary.  However, this movie was released throughout the world starting in 2013, first in Russia.  By the time it was released in the United States, it was 2014.  The movie was filmed in Indonesia in 2011.

The story starts in an international high school (known as a college in Britain) in Jakarta, Indonesia.  A philosophy teacher, Mr. Zimit, on the last day of class with his group of 20 senior students who are about to graduate, plays a game/exercise with them.  Their passing grades to graduate from his class relies on this exercise.  He offers a scenario and students must come up with their own reasoning as to how they would handle the situation given.  A box of folded papers contains variables such as the career/expertise or backgrounds of a student.  For example, a student might be gay or might work as a politician or a doctor, etc.  In a life or death scenario, students must make the best choices that would offer them the best chance of survival.  It requires students to handle conflict and teamwork in order to gain the best solution.  The students get to argue their points as to why they chose one teammate vs. another, and they must live with the consequences as who they don't choose can die before the rest, and they must live with the people they choose to keep with them.

This of course seems like a fun game that anyone of us can play with our friends, and that's what attracted me to the movie.  It's a scenario game that you can set up with your friends in a party and discuss what can possibly happen.  Such a game of course requires a facilitator and in this movie the instructor is the facilitator.  The only problem here is that the instructor is part of the game and therefore, will likely have a bias because he wants to influence the outcome as he seem to know the answers as to what will actually happen at the end.  A true facilitator should not be in the game to prevent bias and to make the exercise fair.

In the movie, several scenarios are played, but all of them have a common theme.  There is conflict in the world that is about to cause a nuclear apocalyptic destruction where everyone knows that nuclear bombs are about to fall from the sky at a precise time.  Near them is a ready built bunker that has enough oxygen and food to last a year for 10 people.  The underground shelter will offer protection from the nuclear blasts, but the 10 people in it must live and deal with each other long enough to reboot the human race when they eventually get out of the bunker.  Of the 21 people in the classroom, 11 of them will be left out and will likely die from radiation poisoning from the blasts.  The group has only minutes to decide who enters and who stays out.  How do you choose who enters the bunker and who stays out?

As students make decisions, eventually something goes wrong or mistakes are made, and the teacher resets the scenario to include new clues or changes the variables, such as who is with what backgrounds.  Sometimes the bunker is in the middle of a desert and sometimes its near a beach.  Sometimes people do things for selfish reasons and sometimes people are more altruistic due to love or emotional feelings.  The reality is that there are no real right and wrong reasons when you truly think about it because we can't really predict the future of what might come next or what additional variables might arise.  We can only do our best based on the situation given and how each person re-act at the time that things are happening as emotions can change at a flip of a dime.  Due to the importance of procreation as a wanted outcome in the movie, sexuality does play a role as to how people might be selected.  Thus, one variable is that some people may be homosexuals while others are heterosexuals.  Sometimes the expertise of the individual may outweigh the person's sexuality as a need to be in the bunker.  With that criteria, this movie does have some scenes of sexual behavior and nudity, thus the reason this movie is rated R (for mature audiences).

Anyway, the movie is well thought out even though we can criticize that the exercises have some flaws.  In order to keep the movie less than two hours, I'm sure they could not include everything they wanted in this movie.  The special effects are rudimentary probably because of limited budgets, but the sets are well made and the actors were quite good.  The director did a decent job in telling the story and I'm glad the producers chose to make this film as it is thought provoking.  This is a great game to play with my friends and I would probably change up the scenarios.  The movie was entertaining if you don't try to get political about it as I have seen some reviewers try to do in their reviews.  There's no need to talk about the representation of the characters, as I'm sure if you ever play such a game with your friends, your circle of friends won't represent every race/sexuality/religion/expertise in the world or will only represent the same race/backgrounds as you depending on how you make friends.",1531008000,,5135,4.5271149674620395
