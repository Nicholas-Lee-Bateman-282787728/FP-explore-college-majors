8194792,2,B00005MM5J,"I caught this on TV one day, don't remember when or on what channel, but I remember it still. The bleeding bag bit was the only reason I remember it. Seriously, how could you not notice?
I remember how mediocre the acting was, and how rediculous the plot was. The characters were all self-centered, whiny brats. I would rather have watched ""Session 9"" than this.
Bottom line: not worth the money",1085529600,2,395,4.577464788732394
8194793,1,B00005MM5J,This movie was just a simple movie-barely any gore-which I love and it is suspenseful.  But it is mostly predictable.  I only caught it on the Sci-Fi channel once but seemed pulled in to watch just how it would end.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to be a little scared but doesn't like gore.,1067040000,2,310,4.310344827586207
8194794,3,B00005MM5J,"Horror 101 is definately a classic independent film with a good plot, good acting, a good mystery, and an overall good job.
  The film takes place with eight students taking a course on fear.  They come for the final exam but the teacher never shows up. Then the lights go out.  As the eight peers walk down the dark halls of the building they begin to mysteriously dissapear.  The film is a classic because there is barely any gore and it's not a slasher film.  It's all purely suspense.",1049587200,3,488,4.426966292134831
8194795,5,B00005MM5J,"This was a truly great film about a class of high school students who find themselves locked in the school.  Unforunately, their teacher never showed and the kids disappear mysteriously.  The acting is great, this movie has suspense AND comedy.  I t was shown on Sci-Fi only ONCE and i was lucky enough to watch it, then buy the dvd. It's really great, i recommend it to all horror fans!",1032912000,,387,4.5
