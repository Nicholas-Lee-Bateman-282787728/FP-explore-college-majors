322610,5,6301005740,"Billy Wilder seemed so consumed by a passion for unmasking human frailty and disrobing them of artifice and subtlety, though certainly not of style... From the indictment of ego, self-destruction, and the fickleness  of popular culture seen in ""Sunset Blvd."", to the baring of the  human will to strive and survive seen in ""Stalag 17"", to the  disguise-as-a-revelation-of-true-character theme of ""Some Like It  Hot""... Wilder consistently laid the wound of weakness open for all to  see it while pointing the mocking, accusing finger at the necessary  accoutrements of social convention. In ""The Lost Weekend"", the  children of the Depression, the men and women of WW2, and the audience  weaned on the Studio system were first confronted with the stark, brutal  vicissitudes of a drunk, lonely novelist whose fear of writer's block is  drowned under a torrent of booze. There are NO adornments here, as we hear  the banshee wail of a man confronted by delirium tremens, and see that same  man hurt those he loves most by loving the bottle a little more... The  insecurities which feed classically-trained Ray Milland foreshadow the  naturalistic, intuitive acting of Marlon Brando, James Dean, and Montgomery  Clift. Moviemaking in general was not the same afterwards.",960768000,4,1268,5.2388059701492535
322611,5,6301005740,"I saw this film when it was first released & the acting, the manner it was portrayed, the hiding of bottles, the scene of the DTs, (the mouse & bat) is still vivid in my mind. I have not had the opportunity to see  it since approx. 1950 but, I can still picture the Opera scene, the begging  for just another drink at the bar, the continual scheming for a drink made  this a picture before it's time, a touchy subject in the days of the first  release. A great show played by great actors managed by a very classy  director.. A must see film.",952214400,3,542,4.123809523809523
322612,4,6301005740,"The movie was a bit too long and almost boring in places.

322614,5,6301005740,"What an amazing movie and still is since 1945. I can see why it won awards for the year. It features a stark reality of Alcoholism. ""Picture"" that, in 1945, a movie about real issues facing real citizens and putting it on the silver screen with big name actors and actresses.
Billy Wilder did a great job on it and today it has garnered more praise for the content. It isn't a movie for everyone, absolutely.
To see Ray Milland, (THE UNINVITED, 1944), portray an alcoholic in this one, lets you know he can really be a great dramatic actor.
The actresses do a fine job as well for the roles given. It's black and white, something that makes this movie what it is.
The DVD edition here is fine, but I would LOVE for ""Criterion"" to pick this one up and do a great restoration job like they did for THE UNINVITED!

There are only a handful of ""Special Features"" on this DVD.
Theatrical Trailer, Production Notes, Bios, etc.

This movie, for such an old movie, sure is realistic. Holds no punches. I could do without the haunting music. Cheapens it in a way. However, the acting is really good. I've only seen Milland in one movie besides this one--""Dial M for Murder"". He does a really good job here. American struggling with drug addictions, slang used by some of the characters, and the seemingly gay nurse kinda resembles modern times. Eerie.

322700,4,6301005740,"The Lost Weekend is an excellent and somewhat overlooked Billy Wilder film. It's not on the level of his best three films (Double Idemnity, Sunset Boulevard, and The Apartment), but it's roughly as good as Ace in the Hole and Some Like It Hot. In addition, it ranks beside Days of Wine and Roses and Leaving Las Vegas as one of the most honest portrayals of alcoholism in American film. Like Robert Zemeckis' Flight (another film that addresses alcoholism in a candid manner), The Lost Weekend chickens out at the end, which is frustrating as the film is very truthful up until that point; the final scenes are the weak link that hold this film back from masterpiece status. Still, this is an exceedingly well-crafted film with some really daring and bold material and as with Double Idemnity, it's impressive what Billy Wilder was able to get away with in the restrictive Hays Code era.

(Fun fact: The liquor industry offered Paramount $5 million to not release the film and they refused without telling Billy Wilder about this offer; when he found out, Wilder said that he would have accepted it.)",1426204800,,1100,4.7591623036649215

One of the very powerful scenes in this movie is when the main character, already being an addict, sits in the theatre and watches La Traviata. He consults libretto and looks very decent and seems engaged in the performance, until the actors during the famous ""Libiamo Ne'lieti Calici"" aria all start to drink. They do it so joyfully, cheerfully, raising and touching their champagne coupes, and the butler makes sure that their glasses stay full. Immediately the mind of the guy becomes anxious, irritable, one pointed - that is, he needs a drink himself! His lips starts to tremble and he can't help rushing out of the seat in the middle of the performance to get a drink. This scene was so powerful for me because that's exactly how it really happens to those who already felt down for booze, and stimulates heavily the others who are close to falling but still might have a chance. It is really very sad to realise that we are reminded of alcohol everywhere: at home, in the movies, in the normal groceries (in Russia at least), all the parties - mandatory, even in theatres! I remember as a young kid of 5 I was told that one drop of alcohol can kill a horse, yet my parents and their guests always had alcohol on all occasions, clearly more than one drop of it. When, after my friend's passing, I realised how much hypocricy is there about alcohol and the consequences of it; that everyone who drinks do contribute, by example and support of this ""tradition"", to the new crowds of addicts, I quit drinking all liquor completely. I hope this movie provoked many more people to do the same.

322739,5,6301005740,"I first watched ""The Lost Weekend"" as a teen in the 1960s and have watched it several times since. It is one of my top ten all-time favorites, and is one I will likely watch again. What makes it such a good movie?

To begin with, when it was released in 1945 alcoholism had never been realistically portrayed in the movies. Drunkenness was the subject of comedy. True, there was the scene near the end of ""Little Caesar"" where the protagonist has hit bottom and has taken to the bottle, but this was a passing moment in the film. ""The Lost Weekend"" was the first attempt to portray alcoholism in all its horror.

Don Birnam (Ray Milland) is not a good or even sympathetic man. He is ruled by the bottle, so much so that he finds ways to duck out of commitments with his girlfriend (Jane Wyman) so that he can get drunk. He even goes so far as to steal rent money (rather than pay the landlady) in order to buy a couple bottles of his favorite rye whiskey. He will go to any lengths to drink, as he does when we see him trudging down a New York street to find a pawn shop so he can pawn his typewriter for a few bucks, and also when he tries to steal money from a woman's purse in a lounge to pay his bar tab.

For the most part, the attempt to portray alcoholism realistically works. Birnam's grandiose moments when he is in the process of getting drunk are compelling. So is the scene in the drunk ward of the local hospital, as is Birnam's desperate move of yanking a bottle of whiskey from a liquor store clerk when he no longer has the money to pay. The DT's scene does a good job of portraying the horrors of this condition.

The one weak point of this movie is the ending. Having sobered up from his five-day drunk (including the DT's), Birnam gets a pep talk from his girlfriend. He goes into his room and, sitting in front of his typewriter (which he was unable to pawn), he begins writing his account of his addiction to the bottle. The assumption is that this exercise will cure him.

However contrived the ending, it is more than offset by a credible portrayal of an alcoholic and by the great acting of Milland and Wyman.",1380153600,,2133,4.26980198019802

322755,4,6301005740,"The Lost Weekend(released Nov/45)stars Ray Milland as Don Birnam,Jane Wyman as Helen, and a great supporting cast. Set in war time New York City(although,the war is not in evidence) and shot on location there,this film is a powerful and dynamic portrayal of an alcoholic that,over a weekend,sinks deeper and deeper into his sickness than ever before,and barely comes out the other side in one piece.
The story starts as Don is about to go off with his brother to spend the weekend in a cottage somewhere. Don is an unemployed writer who has lived off the avails of his brother for years now. A brilliant and promising student in his younger days,he slipped into his alcoholism early on when his stories and his rejections started to get the best of him. Three years earlier he met his current girlfriend Helen while attending the opera La Traviata. One day she found out that Don was a drinker when his brother tried to unsuccessfully cover up for him. However,instead of leaving him for good,as he suggested,she stood by him. Three long and struggling years pass with no discernible progress to kick the habit. Then comes this fateful weekend and as he and brother are about to leave and Don asks his brother to postpone leaving and take Helen out to a show. He makes the excuse that he doesn't like opera anyways. In reality he can't wait for them to leave as Don has a bottle of whiskey dangling from a string outside the apartment window. Helen has flicked a cigarette towards that same open window but it landed on the ledge. Don's brother sees it and goes over to throw it off. Instead he finds the liquor bottle. This is the last straw,his brother cannot take it anymore and leaves him for good.
Don goes from his apartment to the local to drink and back. We watch as his actions become more and more desperate. At one point he ends up at a club and attempts to steal money from a female customer's handbag,who is sitting beside him in order to pay his bar tab,but gets caught. He goes in and out of the drunk tank at Bellevue. He even stoops so low as to try and pawn his typewriter but ironically finds that all the pawn shops are closed because it is Yon Kippur. He begs a drink from the bartender at his local and ends up back home. There he begins to see things. One is a mouse trying to bite its way out of the apartment wall. Then in flies a bat,that dines on the mouse. It starts him screaming which alerts the landlady,who in turn notifies Helen. He has sunk as low as he can get and Helen cleans him up. With a cigarette in his mouth he starts to pick up a drink,but instead drops his cigarette into it. Helen smiles and Don finally seems to wise up vowing to write in every detail about his ""lost weekend"".
This film is as powerful today as it was back in /45. However the film's release was held up due to negative reaction from preview audiences. When it was released,it garnered four academy awards including one for Milland. It also won the highest award at the Cannes Film festival,which makes it and only one other(Marty),the only two films with that distinction. The film really tells it like it is and could be used at any AA meeting even today. It deals with all the excuses that alcoholics use and how their sickness drags down the lives of everyone around them. It also shows the sordidness that they can descend to and,like any addiction,what depths they will plummet to in order to maintain their habit. The old New York skyline is much in evidence throughout as well as that cities many landmarks,including Bellevue. Watch for the piano player at the bar Milland goes to(where he tries to purse steal),that is Harry Barris,Bing Crosby's old pal from his old singing group the Rhythm Boys. This film,I believe,was one of the first if not the first,to use a theremin. It's one of the earliest electronic type instruments used to augment atmosphere. It has been used much more since then in Sci-Fi films and on TV to give the proceedings an extra scary feeling. The original The Day the earth Stood Still is a perfect example.
Technically speaking the film is in full screen mode,natch. However this film is in rough shape throughout and is in need of a new print striking and remastering. Universal now owns Paramounts pre 1950 sound film catalogue and should have done this a long time ago. This is an academy award winning film for gosh sakes,and that alone should have been enough of an impetus to do the necessary work. For their laziness I have deducted a 1/2 star off this rating. Extras are just the trailer,some production and cast notes.
All in all a must have film,despite the less than stellar shape the film is in. It deservedly won four academy awards in the day and is still a compelling film about alcoholism and its entire dynamic. A must own. Highly recommended.",1353542400,,4809,4.5478662053056516

322760,5,6301005740,"When I first watched this motion picture in 1946 I was captivated and drawn into it completely. I have viewed it several times since, and each time I still experience the tension and the foreboding atmosphere that it generated the first time. The opening scene, where the camera moves across the skyline of New York and closes in on the image of the liquor bottle dangling by the cord from the window ledge, is striking, haunting, and encapsulates the theme of the entire movie. The background music is appropriate, equally memorable, and not obtrusive. This is one of perhaps only two motion pictures (Spellbound was another) that used the electronic instrument, the theremin, to produce the wavering, somewhat high-pitched tone. Most people, in the year of its release, were not aware of the theremin and made wild guesses as how the sound was created. I remember reading an article by Charles Jackson, the author of the book on which the movie is based, who said he watched it nine times!

Movies that included people with drinking problems, prior to this one, portrayed them as unfortunate, often comical characters. This movie treats the main character, Ray Milland, as a real person with a real problem. His struggles and the crises he faces are not corny. I have long since memorized the storyline, every scene, every plot twist, and can even recite many of the lines that Milland quotes at the bar, but it never gets old. I can watch again and again, and appreciate the ability of each actor to communicate the idea or emotion.

This movie should be watched for its unique form and content.",1336176000,2,1598,4.807272727272728
322761,5,6301005740,"What is fear? Fear is being sober, or taking that last sip, or not having any money to buy a half pint at least. Despair. Being alive and dead at the same time, being a zombie, having no will to live but too big of a coward to end it all. Despair. Realizing that your life is gone, that your dream is, and always has been, a mirage, and the only time it becomes real is when you're drowning yourself with a bottle of whiskey.

This is Don Birnam's hell, a hell everyone living with the scourge of alcoholism deals with everyday. Don, played by Ray Milland in one of the great performances in film history, up there with the very very best, is a man whose dreams of being a great writer have died. Now, to salve his pain, he has taken refuge in forgetfulness, in alcohol. But there's a beautiful woman in his corner and she will not give up on him even though he's given up on himself.

This is the definitive movie on substance abuse. Alcohol is a metaphor for addiction to anything, sex, crack,etc. But in this case it's alcohol and when they throw around the phrase ""Best Picture"" this film should be mentioned among them, if only for Ray Milland's powerful performance and Billy Wilder's direction. If ever there were a character study film, Lost Weekend is it. Surprisingly visceral and gritty for the time that it was done.

322762,3,6301005740,"It's clear that most reviews are written by enthusiasts: that's why most product reviews are so high. Naturally, there is also the odd reviewer who really hates a book or movie and is determined to have his opinion heard. However, the vast, silent majority are mostly indifferent to almost everything. In any case, the point of this rather abstract introduction is that I fall into none of these three categories: I'm a movie lover who was disappointed by this ""classic"" of the forties. I had seen it before, but many years ago when I was a kid.

I admit that for its time it was ground-breaking. Hollywood didn't usually treat of alcoholism in any serious way and here we get benders, DTs, alcoholic hospitals, moral degradation and a lot more. Yet somehow--and I suppose we should expect this--the movie never quite loses its Hollywood sheen. Ray Milland is good enough in the leading role, but given Hollywood's propensity for gifting the acting oscar to anyone who is given an overacting opportunity, the oscar award doesn't say a lot. Everyone does a competent job, but the real problem is in the screenplay. Milland is an alcoholic who has never had a job, but wants to become a writer. It is assumed from the beginning that somewhere deep inside Birnam there is a real and talented writer struggling to emerge: but what is the proof? A few student articles and an early piece in Reader's Digest. Other than that, there is zilch. Lots of people want to write--but unless you write you're not a writer. Perhaps it would have been unendurable at the time to admit that most alcoholics don't have any special skill waiting to emerge: they are simply alcoholics. The Hollywood schmaltz element is further highlighted when Jane Wyman, a worker on Time magazine and the possessor of a perfect Hollywood wardrobe, decides to fall in love with our alcoholic nobody who--for reasons of Hollywood etiquette--must have the makings of a 'somebody'inside him. This might actually have done harm to the real alcoholics' cause, as one of the worst aspects of the disease is that the sufferer becomes a social pariah: the idea of an unemployed alcoholic winning the love of a high class lady from Time magazine and keeping it through all his degradations is pure Hollywood hoo-ha. Even the end of the movie rings false with Milland giving up drink and beginning on his infamous novel, ""The Bottle"", once again. This is supposed to be a happy ending--but the odds are that its just one more false dawn before the drinking starts again.

I'm sorry to be so negative, but this movie after deciding to deal with an important issue of this kind refuses to face the real horrors head on and, instead, is determined to wrap them up in several layers of Hollywood hokum.",1316217600,3,2752,4.767295597484277
322763,5,6301005740,"Back in the mid-40's, there were few American made films that touched upon such controversial subjects as alcoholism.  Much was the mentality that `the movies' were a place to forget your problems and be `entertained'.  So, when Billy Wilder attempted to create a dark and grimacing film about the disease that so many American men and women battle on a daily basis, it was nearly an uphill battle from the very start.

I'm so glad he trudged up that hill.

The film revolves around a singular weekend in the life of aspiring author Don Birnam.  Birnam has been struggling the `the bottle' for years, and his recovery has been a long time coming.  On the eve of a weekend getaway with his brother Wick, Don slips away for a few drinks.  This tragic misstep leads to a weekend alone in the city with Don desperately fighting his inner desire to fill that void left when alcohol leaves his system.  Being cut off financially, Don is forced to fend for himself, feeding the monkey on his back by selling off his belongings and stealing from strangers.  Disparaging looks from others leads Don to loathe himself and what he's become.

But will this weekend truly be lost on the weak?

With a riveting (Oscar winning) performance by Ray Milland, `The Lost Weekend' becomes something truly special.  This film really takes you inside the mind of a man lost in his own skin, a man trying to fight his way out of a losing situation.  I've been around alcoholics my whole life.  It is a disease that has run its course in my own family, and it has plagued the life of friends.  Watching Don was like watching a loved one, and that is all thanks to the remarkable way that Ray Milland layered this man.  Milland is aided by some key supporting players, most notably his female counterparts; Jane Wyman and Doris Dowling.  Wyman is heartbreaking as Don's longsuffering girlfriend Helen, and Dowling sizzles as the young woman longing for Don's attention.

With key plot elements embellished thanks to nicely placed flashbacks, Wilder's masterpiece still holds true today.  The chilling score and the beautifully shot sequences also add to the staying power of this film.

Not for the faint of heart, but well worth your time and attention.",1300320000,2,2228,4.72279792746114

The print here is good but a blu ray treatment is needed. Ray Milland puts in one of his best performances by far on this one. Billy Wilder who was always great lays down a solid story that makes people thing about how devasting alcoholism really is. This came out about the same time as the classic 'snakepit' movie did which exposed the monsterous mental institions of the day and that shows that film could tackle real issues and be entertaining as well. The forties made strides in that regard in several ways , but this one remains very powerful and poignant thanks to everyone involved with this picture.  It's solid and I don't understand all these 'great movie! but then they give it three stars?.

322765,5,6301005740,"Tour de force by Ray Milland whose career seemed to apex here. Can't believe I was watching the same actor who wound up doing JD and Corman quickies in the early 60's and nadiring with the embarrassing THING WITH TWO HEADS [1972].  Milland plays Don Birnum, a handsome, eloquent but underachieving writer who escapes his fears and inadequacies by reaching for the bottle. He is supported economically and emotionally by his brother Wick, played by Philip Terry. Terry, married to actress Joan Crawford at the time and resembling a Clark Gable sibling, is superb as the caring brother who ultimately succumbs to the futility of his task. Terry was another talented actor who wound up doing 60's B to Z tripe [still very good in the otherwise terrible, THE LEECH WOMAN, 1960]. Jane Wyman, resplendent and never more lovely, plays Birnum's ""girl"", Helen St. James, the lady friend who will never give up trying to save her man who is spiraling into oblivion. Her resolution is admirable but almost childlike and even foolhardy as she persists despite Birnum's repeated setbacks and narcissism.

There were some memorable characterizations in this one: 1- Nat, the bartender, played by the always charismatic and terrific character actor Howard Da Silva---piericing eyes, flared nostrils, sharp tongued, and all. He is Birnum's oasis---his father confessor, his enabler. Great repartee between the two. You just have to love his rebuke of Birnum for conning Gloria the barfly, accepting a date he will never be sober for, and for having such a refined young woman as Helen constantly worried and looking for him, not knowing where he is or if he is well; 2- Gloria, played by Doris Dowling, whose stop-the-presses appearance---smoothly striding behind Birnum and stroking the back of his hairline then pointing and ""clicking"" a gun she feigns---is as sharp and sensual as anything Lauren Bacall did in TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT [1944] and leaves all noir femmes  in the dust; 3- Birnum's elderly landlady who knows everything about her alcoholic neighbor by studying his movements, counting the number of milk bottles left at his doorstep, and listening to the sounds behind his locked door. The old lady is a doozy; 4- Bim, played by vet Frank Faylen, the male nurse at the hospital alcoholic ward where Birnum ends up. He knows everything about the furtive and recalcitrant ways, and the guises and horrors of, the alcoholic. His blunted affect and detached manner are disturbing. There were also some delightfully endearing moments such as Helen sporadically asking the taller Don to ""bend down"" [for his kiss] and  repositioning his cigarette end correctly into his mouth. Throughout the play, though, Helen was certain that Don's need for the bottle was greater than his love for her.

As Birnum's funds run out and his memory becomes more impaired he resorts to lying, stealing and just plain taking. This leads to humiliation, degradation, and like the ""vicious"" circles of his shotglass stains on the bar, to a greater need for escape and self-medication via the bottle.  He ends up in an alcoholic ward but, repelled by the loony's around him, manages to escape. He returns home  only to experience hallucinations and to rock-bottom and plan his suicide. He procures a gun at a pawn shop but Helen finds out and confronts him. Helen won't let up trying to deter the slippery, double-talking Birnum from carrying out his impulsive final act. It looks like she's going to fail until a knock at the door. It's guardian angel Nat returning Don's misplaced typewriter and wishing him well with a reattempt at writing and with ""lilacs from Illinois""---the latter a reference to an earlier conversation between the two in which Birnum was trying to describe his love for Helen whom he had just met and for whom he had abstained for six weeks. Nat's appearance just a tap on the shoulder that outsiders with no clear bonds to him cared, and that they wished him love and success. Even Gloria, whom he had stood up, came through for him at the worst of times.

Disappointing, uninspired ending was only shortcoming. While Nat may have been Don's guardian angel, Helen was the hero in this film. Waiting and waiting at the end for the self-involved big lug to finally verbally and affectionately reciprocate Helen's singular and unwavering love, loyalty and dedication and to reward her with the sincere, implicit commitment she has fought for. Not even a thank you? Instead we have an impersonal news-reporter-like  ending with Milland talking about the plights of others in NYC who have a problem with the bottle, like himself. Director Wilder probably believed that, in the throes of alcoholic ambivalence/withdrawal/cold-turkeying, reciprocation was not emotionally feasible at that time, but, I would have preferred the Hollywood ending with the adorable and admirable Helen getting her due. Just irked me that twice Helen extended her arms out to Don supplicating for his commitment only to be ignored. Felt like smashing a bottle of spirits over his head. In addition, after all the nightmares, Don's sudden cessation of imbibition was not credible. There's a great deal of work yet to be done, and Don is going to need Helen now more then ever. Otherwise, a superb production, pefectly cast, a memorable screenplay, outstanding performances by all involved.

322771,4,6301005740,"I recently screened LOST WEEKEND for a film series I'm involved with.  To be frank, I wasn't all that surprised to get the mixed reactions I did receive.  I seem to react differently to the film every time I see it myself.  It wasn't surprising, therefore, to see a similar range of opinion among other viewers.  There are aspects of the film that seem contrived and many more that seem dated, but there are also moments that are as hard hitting now as they must have been for audiences in 1945.  After having seen the film a few times, I find that (as with pretty much anything else), a lot of my reaction toward it depends on my own mood.  There have been times when I've snickered at the ""D.T.s"" scene, for instance:  I mean, was the bat on loan from the DRACULA set?

Other moments can seem a little much as well but should perhaps be considered in the context of the era.  I found the explanations Ray Milland's Don Birnam character gives to Nat the bartender and other assorted listeners as to just WHY he drinks a little too flowery and affected.  ""Wha?  He feels like he's riding on a barge down the Nile? Yeah, right.""  If the screenwriters' aim is to suggest that would-be writer Birnam is sqandering his talent, their intentions may backfire.  He just may be a better drunk than he is a writer.  (And how about the scene where he actually TRIES to write and mangages, well, the title page AND the dedication before he's off on a toot.  Let that be a lesson to aspiring writers everywhere: write the darn thing, THEN do the title page.)

But as I say, you should consider the times.  Viewers in 1945 hadn't been as inundated with addiction lore and jargon as we are today.  Many of them might well have been given food for thought by Milland's verbose explanation for why he's a lush.  And you know, they--and WE--couldn't help but be charmed by this particular lush.  Ray Milland is very good in this role.  He was an appealing actor, but one who didn't mind exploring his dark side (think DIAL M FOR MURDER, as well as this one).  He consistently transcends the hokiness.  You see how he somehow manages to keep his dutiful girlfriend (Jane Wyman) and loyal brother (Phillip Terry) on a tether for the longest time.  I doubt there has ever been a more accurate depiction of ""co-dependency"" onscreen: and this decades before ""enabling"" would become part of our everyday parlance.

This time out, I found myself appreciating LOST WEEKEND much, much more than I had at earlier screenings.  Perhaps it was the contrarian in me: I just had to counter some of the naysayers in the audience.  One criticism I had to answer, was the opinion of one fellow viewer that the much later DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES was a much superior film on the theme of alcoholism.  I felt that BOTH films look somewhat dated nowadays--and in similar ways.  The leads in both films go from charming lushes to delirious addicts in remarkably short order, for instance.  And, interestingly, both have their ""desperate hunt for the hidden bottle"" scene.  Much about both films might come off nowadays as being a little cliched.

Both, of course, have their strengths as well.  There's real grit and humor in both, and it's plain that by the mid-20th century, audiences would not be sitting through mere morality plays on film.  But I'd have to say that LOST WEEKEND had, at least, some strengths that the later film did not.  It's a much less stagey drama.  The exterior shots give the viewer much more of a sense of place (urban New York) than DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES even attempted to do with its San Francisco setting. No viewer will readily forget the montage of scenes with Ray Milland hitting pawn shop after closed pawn shop, trying to unload his typewriter.  That's good cinema.

And Billy Wilder's film had to focus on the plight of a single individual, whereas Blake Edwards and co. got to divvy up the drama (and the viewer's sympathies) between a husband and wife team of co-dependent alkies.  If Jane Wyman's character is, in contemporary terminology, an ""enabler,"" Lee Remick was a full participant in the inebriated downward spiral, a valid artistic choice, certainly, and one that made for quite a different spin.  BUT it's evident Ray Milland had to work all the harder to carry his role off. I don't begrudge him his Academy Award at all--nor do I begrudge Billy Wilder his, although this is far from his best work.",1260144000,2,4409,4.59539052496799

To re-hash the plot would be redundant as so many reviewers have already done so.  I will concentrate my review on the protagonist: writer Don Birnam. The movie opens (and closes) with an aerial shot of a NYC apartment window and a bottle suspended outside.  Don and his brother Wick are packing for a long weekend in the country and Don is trying to figure out how he is going to smuggle his bottle along. Priceless is the disdain with which Don responds to Wick touting the countryside, with its fresh air and clean, crisp well water! The very thought of having to drink water sets Don off into a nasty and biting rejoinder. Needless to say, Don doesn't go and the result, told partially in flashbacks, is one man's descent into the deepest, horrific depths of alcoholic hell.
Every time I think about this film I get that crazy background sound in my ear---that eerie, high-pitched howling that Don Birnam (aka Ray Milland in his Best Actor, Oscar-winning performance) must have piercing his alcohol-saturated brain after downing two quarts plus of cheap rye. He becomes Don Birnam. Absolutely believable! Surrounded by a fine supporting cast and expertly directed by Billy Wilder, his is a performance for the ages. I can't say enough about it. Never would Ray Milland achieve such notoriety again. Sad. He was an amazing actor and it just goes to prove that talent, combined with brilliant directing is a sure-fire combination for success.  Every aspiring actor should watch this film.
I have on more than one occasion contacted the people at the Criterion Collection requesting that they restore this classic. It deserves their treatment. I give it my highest recommendation.",1250380800,2,1848,4.89776357827476
322774,5,6301005740,"Terrifying Best Picture winner of 1945 is this classic movie that may feature Ray Milland's all time greatest performance.

Milland stars as a chronic alcoholic who is controlled and tormented by the spectre of the brew. He originally is supposed to take a weekend with his brother until his addiction catches up to him and he fails to meer up with his brother, ending up stranded in his apartment with no one but his desire for alcohol.

His weekend becomes a nightmare as he recounts his past and what led him to this point and the extremes that he'll go to further his addiction. At one point he ends up in an asylum and escapes, only to steal from a liquor store and lose his mind when he holds up in his apartment, suffering from creepy hallucinations.

His devoted girlfriend, beautiful Jane Wyman, is the only thing that holds him together and ultimately gets him through his personal hell.

A truly first rate film that melded the scenery and feel of the rising art of Film Noir with a true human drama, this was a landmark in mature cinema. While far from a ""good time"" film, this is a brave little picture that attacks a deep and troubling issue and presents it with sensitvity and intelligence and emerges as one of the absolutely best films of the 1940s.

Stories about alcoholism can be really depressing but I found this simply a fascinating account of what an alcoholic goes through. I doubt if any film since this as been as effective in telling its sordid story, but not in a sordid manner.

The acting is excellent, led by Ray Milland's performance and complemented by memorable supporting turns by Howard da Silva, Doris Dowling, Frank Faylen, Phillip Terry and Jane Wyman.

I particularly enjoyed the characters played by Faylen, da Silva and Dowling. Faylen had only one scene, but it's a beauty. As a hospital aide, he gives Milland a short but riveting speech that still haunts me when I recall it. Dowling served up some great film noir-type dialog and was a sexy woman, at least in this picture, and da Silva was perfect as the bartender.

This is an involving story and has a few spots with some good cinematography, too. Another plus is the fact that it doesn't appear dated even though it is 60 years old. How many films can say that?

""""""""spoilers ***  The only flaw, I thought, was the ending. Anyone has hooked on booze to the degree Milland was in this film, would not be able to just quit like that....but happy-ending movies are usually what work.

322783,2,6301005740,"This is one powerful movie that must have shocked the audience of those days and yet the message is so relevant and true to this day.  We get a glimpse of what the life of an alcoholic can be like and for me it was almost like watching a truly scary horror film.  It has been said that Billy Wilder did this film because he got inspiration from his co-writer in his previous masterpiece ""Double Indemnity"", Raymond Chandler, who also had a problem with the bottle.  It wouldn't surprise me if he had Chandler totally in mind for the part of Birnam too as the two had a tough time working with each other on the screenplay for that movie.

However, unlike some others I thought the ending was very good because if you think about it, the movie ends as it began with Birnam promising that he had changed after another one of his binges.  In fact, I'm unconvinced that there actually was a happy ending here as it is ambiguous enough to suggest that things haven't really changed but that things could simply be repeating themselves over and over again.  In the middle of the film we get Birnam telling the bartender in a flashback how he met up with his long-suffering girlfriend and how he was able because of her to stop drinking for weeks until the pressure of meeting up with the potential in-laws got him so scared that he returned to the bottle.  All I saw at the ending was something similar where Birnam once again makes a promise but there was nothing to suggest that he would keep it the next time another stressful incident in his life arises.

I thought the ending was ominous and so true of anyone struggling with addiction in that one never really knows if one has really licked it but one has to keep on getting up every time without giving up and keep on trying to the end.  Sounds a lot like life in general and yet so true of addicts.  For this reason, I felt that this was a great movie with a great script, great acting, great directing and hence overall an excellent work of art with a very good message about life.

The problem I have is with the picture and sound quality of this dvd which hasn't been restored at all resulting in many imperfections at many parts of the film and although the sound quality is alright as far as Dolby Digital Mono quality goes, it would have been much better had a restored version with 5.1 or THX options be included.  As it is, this great film is not deserving of such a poor dvd transfer and here's hoping they get together to properly restore both the sound and especially the picture quality of this classic film.

As it stands though I cannot recommend this dvd version of this film and I suggest you wait for a much better restored version with decent special or bonus features to be released.",1207526400,10,2754,4.3870333988212185
322784,4,6301005740,"I'm sure this was an important movie in its time, with its breakthrough treatment of the horrors of alcholism.  Ray Milland does an excellent job of creating a character who wins our sympathy by his natural looks and class inspite of the horrendous things he does to feed his addiction.

What mostly bothered me is the unrelenting misery of it all.  It is hard to really see why the Wyman character would stick with this man for three years if this is all she saw of him.  Having played this role, in real life, I can testify that it takes a lot of good to put up with this much bad.  It would have been a much more interesting and realistic film if they had shown the happy times, when Milland was sober and able to love this very fine woman -- the emotional roller coaster that alcholics can put their loved ones through. Alcoholics are often charming, talented people as the Milland character is and they can be very affectionate and winning.  But we don't see any of that beyond the first few minutes of their meeting at the opera.  So the film gives us no reason to justify the faithfulness of this woman.  She is not shown as needy or masochistic--that would have made the relationship more believable and interesting.  However when the film came out, not as much was known about alcholism and co-dependancy as we now know.

As meritorious as it may be to show explicitly the downside of alcoholism, I question the wisdom of showing only the dark side, without the brightness which makes the dark even more poignant.  If we had seen something of his true talent or his true ability to care about anyone but himself, we might care more about his downward plunge.

We don't get enough back story, either, to explain why this man has succombed so radically to alcohol.  We hear that he didn't get much success in his early attempts at writing, but that's not uncommon and all failed writers don't hit the bottle; some keep on and eventually succeed.  Others get jobs.  As far as we know he's from a good family, and has the love and support of his brother.  Psychologically it leaves a lot to be desired.

As ""entertainment"" it is not a lot of fun to watch.  Two hours of a man wanting alcohol and doing anything to get it is ultimately sort of boring.  I much preferred ""The Days of Wine and Roses"" which deals with the same theme.  However it is not as bad as ""Leaving Las Vegas"" which really drags you through the muck.

I agree with others that the tacked on ending is totally unrealistic but they say Wilder had no choice.  I think the value of the film lies in its contribution to the ethos of the time.  It's certainly not something I'd want to see again.",1202601600,3,2665,4.427104722792608
322785,3,6301005740,"The Lost Weekend (Billy Wilder, 1945)

While there's no denying that The Lost Weekend is a pretty durned fine piece of filmmaking, looking at it sixty years later, it's impossible to divorce the film from its cultural fallout. Screenwriter Charles Brackett, working from Charles Jackson's potboiler of a novel, did his best to bring out every possible melodramatic moment, and he succeeded tremendously. The problem being, of course, the public believe what they see, no matter how exaggerated for melodramatic effect. The Lost Weekend was one of the biggest steps in the diseasing of America (cf. Stanton Peele's book of the same name); that it is not as reviled today as Birth of a Nation or Triumph of the Will (both similarly excellent films on a technical level) is simply a matter of public perspective.

Ray Milland stars as Don Birnam, the very definition of an addict. Here's a guy who's willing to steal from strangers, manipulate those around him, and generally act as hateful as humanly possible to get his hands on more of the demon rum. (Or, in Birnam's case, the demon rye.) His girlfriend Helen (Jane Wyman) has put up with his alcoholism for years, but is rapidly reaching the end of her rope. His brother Wick (Phillip Terry) has arranged a weekend in the country for them, to get Don to dry out and start working on the novel he's been trying to write for years (The Bottle, a thinly-veiled autobiography about alcoholism). Don wanders off and gets drunk before he can leave with Wick, and the rest of the film chronicles Don's debauchery over the weekend that he's supposed to be in the country, which culminates in him hitting bottom after a quick trip to Bellevue's alcoholic ward. Climactic confrontation, etc., ensues, blah blah blah.

What makes the film stand apart from the usual redemption film is the constant, unrelenting subtext that there is no redemption to be found here. Wilder often seems allergic to happy endings; it has been mentioned more than once that the ending of this flick was mandated by the studio, but Wilder found every way he could to subvert it (without getting too spoilery, note Birnam's constant talk throughout the second half of the film about vicious circles, and then compare the last scene of the film to the first). Well, that and the fact that one of America's greatest directors made the movie, with some of the best and brightest stars of the day. Milland acts his role to a fever pitch, working the melodrama with every ounce of talent he's got and only crossing the overacting line a handful of times. Wyman does a lot more overacting, but she pulls it off, in some weird way; she's quite good at playing the harried girlfriend here. Perhaps the best acting in the film comes from the bartender at Don's favorite watering hole, Ned (Howard Da Silva), who acts as Milland's straight man, feeding him all the right lines, as bartenders are won't to do.

Any fault to be found with this movie has to be found with audience reaction to it, rather than the film itself, but I find that I can't divorce the two in this case. And to think the temperance League wanted to ban the movie, thinking it would encourage drinking. It has done their job far better than they did. ***",1201564800,3,3234,4.708480565371024

When I first saw it nine years ago, I was disappointed that Ray Milland's character didn't find sobriety through  Alcoholics Anonymous. However, AA was still a very young entity (only 10 years old) at the time this movie was made, so it may not have been enough of a force for the filmmakers to have considered for inclusion in the story.  (About 17 years later, things were different: by the early 1960's, AA had a proven track record of success, and credibility, as the impetus for positive change in Jack Lemmon's character in The Days of Wine and Roses.) But even the founders of AA pointed out that there are many ways to sobriety; they never claimed that AA was the one and only option.

322793,5,6301005740,"As with all the great products on Amazon, the spotlight reviews have just about covered everything that should impel one to watch this fine film. I should only like to resonate and emphasize those points.

At its core, The Lost Weekend is a didactic movie that tries to show all the degenerative aspects of alcoholism, with a self-conscious sense of unflinching character. Of course, by now there are plenty of films--both fictional and documentaries--that take on the same goal. The beauty of this one, and the reason for watching it, is in the approach the director takes to relate the message.

To make sure we sympathize with Don Birnam, rather than see him as a doomed sod of a separate class from us, the director employs the film noir style. Don is not a bum or a wife-beater, but an intelligent, witty fellow, with his own quirks (like constantly putting a cigarette the wrong way in) who is driven to drink by the weight of his ambitions--a typical film noir presentation of an essentially decent man corrupted by a wrong decision. As his vice starts to dominate and he tumbles into the abyss, his surroundings reflect the change by moving from the bright cheeriness of an opera or the prospect of a relaxing weekend in the countryside to the dark and seedy halfway ward of the hospital. Here, too, the film noir technique of stark lighting contrasts and dominating shadows play an effective role. Ultimately, as Don reaches rock bottom, he intends to find redemption one way or another, although the ending picks, somewhat superficially, the cheerier of the alternatives.

The reason for watching this movie, then, is not the plot necessarily--even by watching the trailer, you should find out it will focus entirely on a man's spiritual dissolution--but for the empathy it aptly evokes. Don is fully fleshed out, is portrayed as a convincing representation of even the most good-natured person in the audience, and the result is that the viewer feels the heartfelt pangs of withdrawal almost as much as Don himself.

Whoever wants to see superb manipulation of lighting and character development, in other words, need look no further than this noir classic. Everything that needs to support these things is present--a great director, fantastic acting, memorable writing (a quote of which is the title for this review), all these are present. The only thing it lacks is consistency with the ending, but even that is handled so eloquently that you won't walk away with disappointment.

As a side note, since this is a review for the whole product, the DVD has nice video quality, though some of the very dark scenes do show signs of ""static."" The features include only the trailer, and images of production notes and actor/production team biographies.

322795,5,6301005740,"The first time I saw ""The Lost Weekend"" was about a year ago on TCM and in my own opinion, it was a excellent film. Billy Wilder, who had just done ""Double Indemnity"", does not miss a step. Ray Milland's performance as Don Birnam, who was chosen as the star, after several of Hollywood's box office draws had turned it down, was perfect for the part and most deservedly won the Oscar. Jane Wyman was perfect as Don's girlfriend, Helen St. James, who stuck by Don no matter what the outcome. There was also the support of Philip Terry, Howard DaSilva and Doris Downing, who helped to add to the film as well.

While the ending may seem a bit rosy in some regards, any other way in which the film would have ended, possibly with Don committing suicide would have violated the Production Code, which still was prevalent during the 1940's. Also, to take into consideration of World War II coming to an end when the film was made, a rosy ending would probably help to bring a little bit of optimism after years of fighting and bloodshed. That's just what I have surmised from this.

While the movie is good and stands on its own, it leaves out many of the inner musings available in the novel.  There is sugarcoating at the ending and over-dramatization in crucial areas, but it's still a worthwhile movie to add to your addiction collection.

Don Birnam is an alcoholic, he'll do anything for a drink.  'The Lost Weekend' is a short tale of a short part of Don's life, covering his frenzied movements from bar to liquor store to pawn shop.  The movie does a pretty good job of externalizing what is happening inside Don's mind.

""Most men lead lives of quiet desperation,"" Don says, ""I can't take quiet desperation.""  Don is a writer, living off his brother, and spends his weekend boozing it up and reminiscing over days gone by.

My favorite flashback is the one where Don is watching 'The Drinking Song' from the first act of Verdi's 'La Traviata'.  It's priceless.  Don drools over the drinking and the ladies' bell-skirts turn into raincoats, one of them his with his booze in the pocket.

If you love ""addiction"" books and films as I do, this one is a must have for your collection.

322799,5,6301005740,"In more than 60 years, I don't believe any book or film has so vividly captured the madness of alcoholism like ""The Lost Weekend."" The movie with Ray Milland is a chilling adaptation of Jackson's masterful novel. One weekend in an alcoholic's life, as he begs, lies and steals in order to begin a bender that will end in a funhouse horror descent into insanity.

Jackson's novel was brilliantly written, a voyeuristic look inside the mind and desperation of a drunk, who ping pongs between delusion and outright disgust about his habit. There are delirium tremens, falls down stairs, begging at the bars, the pawning of beloved items and absolute shame through it all. Jackson never tries to romanticize the disease or to add elements to it that are not already there. Alcoholism does not need a professional writer or movie maker to enhance its ugliness.

Ray Milland takes on the movie role with animation, anger and pathos that is so genuine, you will think him authentically drunk throughout the film. The viewer is alternately sad and sympathetic, disgusted and frustrated as the drunk weaves, stumbles and staggers into his spree.

Alcoholics cringe when they read this book or watch the movie. The circumstances are too recognizable, too real. The novel ends on a stark note. The movie, which also drops the subtle homosexual undercurrent, chooses to end more optimistically.

Then there is Helen herself:  this is no girl pining away for a worthless man but a strong young woman of character who believes in Don when no one else does.  Miklos Rosza's unsettling, Theremin-dominated musical score sounds more like a score for an episode of the 1950's-1960's anthology series THE TWILIGHT ZONE than like typical `40's movie music.  And finally, there is Milland's portrayal of Don, which is startlingly naturalistic, particularly so in the truly frightening ""bat and mouse"" hallucination scene and in the touching scene where he overhears Helen's ""respectable"" parents talking about him and suddenly decides he needs a drink.  Told partially in flashback to disorienting effect, THE LOST WEEKEND prefigures a 1962 movie about alcoholism, DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES, both in its general themes and in a specific scene, where Don drunkenly ransacks his brother's house for a bottle he hid there when he was sober.  (This incident brings to mind Jack Lemmon's painful ""greenhouse scene"" in the later film.)  Progressive in more ways than one, Wilder's movie is essential viewing along with DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES and Otto Preminger's 1955 THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM, starring Frank Sinatra as an aspiring drummer struggling with an addiction to heroin.",1143504000,3,1939,5.047021943573668
322801,5,6301005740,"This movie clearly demonstrates the hopeless nature of alcoholism.  The bottle rules his life and although there are people who love him and want to support him, he finds ways to keep the liquor close by.  This movie is very realistic until the very end when it appears that for some reason he finds hope.  I don't really like the ending.

Lost Weekend was written prior to AA really being well known.  I think it shows the guilt and despair very well.",1143417600,,452,4.463414634146342
322802,5,6301005740,"""The Lost Weekend"" delivers a glimpse into the world of an alcoholic.  The alcoholic is Don Birman, a failed writer who seems unable to recapture the early creative success of his youth.  He is magnificently portrayed by handsome leading man, Ray Milland, who doesn't mind looking really scruffy throughout the movie.

Birman is someone who abandons a writing project almost as soon as he begins one.  He's so afraid to ""fail"" that he doesn't even try to succeed at anything.  Birman claims a lack of inspiration and focus.  He should have remembered that wise old adage ""creativity is 99% perspiration and only 1% inspiration"".  But he is undisciplined and not confident.

Birman's impatience and non-commitment to his work build frustration and reinforce insecurities within himself.  To numb these painful feelings, he increasingly turns to alcohol.

Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, Wilder's frequent collaborator have written a courageous often harrowing screenplay.  It is searingly honest in its depiction of the downward spiral caused by substance abuse.  And Wilder's forceful direction shows that he is in complete command of this sensitive subject matter.

My only complaint about this movie is the music score by Miklos Rozsa.  Whenever Milland's character is lured by an alcoholic drink, Rozsa's score sounds as if it is emitting radio waves.  Was this the composer's way of suggesting that alcohol was an invisible force over Don Birman?  Only the usually reliable Rozsa knows for sure.

At any rate, ""The Lost Weekend"" is a powerful and uncompromising chronicle of alcoholism.  Please see it!",1141344000,2,1609,5.267716535433071

322804,5,6301005740,"In every mannerism, every lie, every scam, every broken promise, every action, all the desperate need, author Don Birnem (played by Ray Milland) is alcoholism personified.  The movie is from 1940s, and the appearance of an alcoholic (or any addict) is identical today, a full 70 years later.  My chief complaint is with the ending, which is a cop-out to the time of this movie, and the only part of the plot which isn't true to the nature of alcoholism (a good speech and a decision to go cold turkey is NOT going to change a man who drinks so much he hallucinates).  Despite the flimsiness of the ending, I highly recommend this movie.

Don Birnem is a ""writer"" in the loosest sense of the term and an alcoholic in the most sincere sense of the term.  He lives off his brother Wick and his loving girlfriend Helen.  Wick has spent years covering for his brother, and Helen is determined to cure her boyfriend of a disease she considers equivalent to heart or lung trouble.  Don exemplifies the most desperate manipulations of an alcoholic--stealing from his own maid, getting so distracted by champagne onstage in the opera that he has to sneak out for his bottle, sneaking away from those who love him so he can get his fix, needs ""just one"" to settle his nerves (and it never ends there), and continually manipulating the neighborhood bartender.  He delivers a brilliant monologue to the bartender about the painful waking of an alcoholic, wondering if it is daytime and a bottle can be bought, or if it is the dreadful Sunday, and no alcohol can be obtained.

The cinematography is outstanding, especially the scenes in Don's apartment, which he destroys looking for hidden alcohol.  Some shots are taken from the overturned lamp, reinforcing the discord of Don's life well.  Others focus on places were the audience remembers Don hid a bottle, but he can't remember.",1140393600,,1871,4.743827160493828

The degradations that Milland suffers because of his addiction are depicted in a totally unblemmished way.

322808,5,6301005740,"Topping even I'LL CRY TOMORROW (1955) and DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES (1962), Billy Wilder's Oscar-winning THE LOST WEEKEND (1945) is the greatest alcoholism drama in Hollywood's history.  In the performance of a lifetime, Ray Milland plays Don Birnham, a New York writer who goes on a weekend binge when his unpleasant brother (Phillip Terry) and girl friend Helen (Jane Wyman) go on vacation.  His goal is to finish a novel while alone in Manhattan, but the bottle gets the best of him.

This is a harrowing drama for adults and a powerful cautionary drama about the horrors of alcohol.  To think that it passed the Hays Office censor board and came out of mainstream Hollywood makes one momentarily proud.  Wilder seemed to have a genius, along with writer Charles Brackett, for getting controversial material approved by the censors-DOUBLE INDEMNITY, SUNSET BLVD., ACE IN THE HOLE, and this.  Repeatedly, he made masterpiece after masterpiece that still does Hollywood proud and helped the film industry grow up bit by bit.  My Mom keeps reminding me that he also did them with no profanity at all when I swear too much.

WEEKEND opens with a dolly in shot of a bottle of alcohol dangling by a string out a Manhattan apartment window-Birnham's hidden bottle.  But his brother finds it and pours it down the drain.  How to get more booze after brother and Helen leave?  Birnham sweet-talks the semi-friendly local bartender Bim (Howard da Silva, who should have also been Oscar-nominated).  Sitting for hours in the bar, Don tells Bim in flashback how he met Helen at an opera performance.

Later, in the present day, he tries to hock his typewriter instead of writing with it, but today is Sunday.  He finds another bottle of booze, I don't know what kind as a non-drinker, hiding in a light fixture.  Instead of writing, he drinks and drinks and drinks...and has horrifying d.t.'s in a scene that is still chilling and overwhelming.  He ends up in the alcoholic ward of Bellevue Hospital.  Legend has it that Wilder filmed this sequence on location inside Bellevue by showing the administrators a bogus ""G""-rated children's screenplay.  Two years later, George Seaton sought to film his MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET (1947) inside Bellevue, with Santa Claus getting psychiatric treatment--and was refused.  Poor Bellevue did not want to get suckered again!

THE LOST WEEKEND is a masterpiece.  I believe the Charles Jackson source novel is even bleaker.  His Don Birnham is gay and has no girl friend (or boy friend) to help him get sober.  I think he is still an alcoholic at the book's end. I might be wrong because I have not read it.  Screenwriters Wilder and Brackett want something tentatively positive, if not completely happy, for their great movie.  I won't tell you what it is.  But I will say the ending is unforgettable and exhilarating--the camera that tracked in at the beginning to a bottle of booze hanging out a window now pulls back from the same window with no bottle.  Powerful voice-over as we pan along an apartment wall to a matte painting of the Manhattan skyline and Miklos Rozsa's powerful music swelling up:  ""And out there in that great big concrete jungle, I wonder how many others there are like me, poor bedeviled guys on fire with thirst. Such comical figures to the rest of the world as they stagger blindly toward another binge, another bender, another spree.""  So ends one of the greatest dramas in movie history and the definitive alcoholism drama.  THE LOST WEEKEND does Hollywood proud.

322809,5,6301005740,"This review is for the 2000 Universal DVD release.

It's no surprise that this film won 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor.  The film gives a very powerful and convincing look at alcoholism.  The story revolves around three main characters: a failing novelist named Don Birnam (Ray Millard), Don's brother Wick (Phillip Terry) and Don's girlfriend Helen (Jane Wyman).  The story opens with Don and Wick packing to go away for the weekend so that Don can work on a novel at a secluded resort.  It becomes very obvious that Don has a severe drinking problem and Wick is doing everything possible to isolate him from alcohol.  Helen stops by the brothers' apartment and Don finagles Wick into taking Helen out for a few hours that afternoon before they are to leave town.  Being left by himself, it's downhill for Don as he goes on a 'bender' of colossal proportions for the next several days.

Ray Millard gives the performance of a lifetime.  He's a drunk for sure, but one with charm and intelligence.  Jane Wyman also gives a memorable performance as the quintessential codependent girlfriend.  The story is very believable and shows not only how it devastates the drinker himself, but also how it victimizes all the people in his life - especially the people who love him the most.  The film also convincingly reveals some of the medical problems that accompany alcoholism and withdrawing from that condition.  The cinematography was also original with some unique close-up shots, plus the music score used a theremin to induce a dark and haunting mood.  This is one of those movies that once it started, I had no idea where is was going and it was a wild ride most of the way.  The ending is good, and maybe just naively too good.  Still, it's a movie I strongly recommend.

As for the DVD, the picture is sharp and the black & white tones are balanced.  The movie did have some intermittent tiny specs of film deterioration pretty much through the entire picture.  The few bonus features include the trailer and short written essays about the film and the people involved with the movie production.

322810,5,6301005740,"Like CROSSFIRE, which was based on Richard Brooks' anti-homophobic novel THE BRICK RAINBOW, but which took every scarp of homosexuality out of it by switching its story from gay-bashing among US veterans to anti-Semitism, Billy Wilder's THE LOST WEEKEND remains one of those crypto-gay films that tries, but utlimately cannot quite manage to erase the gay subtext of the novel it was based on.

Charles Jackson's book is compelling, no more frank or harrowing than the movie, but anyone who reads it can quickly see what becomes occluded in the film--a little bit cloudy and mysterious, as though you went out for popcorn and missed a key scene.  Anyone reading the book would know that alcoholism is not the only reason Don seems to want to ditch Helen and her quiet support, and instead escape to a series of seedy downtown cocktail lounges.  It's because he's gay but can't admit it, not even to his understanding bro, Wick.  He can't tell it to Helen either, even though she halfway knows in her heart of hearts.  Instead Don just dives deeper into the bottle, seeking forgiveness and oblivion both.  And while he's plowed, he manages to have a whole bunch of sex with a whole bunch of GI Bill, postwar, Cold War guys who just want to have fun.

It was an alcoholic culture and in it, a certain amount of homosexuality could flourish.  In Wilder's film, the bartender played by Howard Da Silva is absolutely heterosexual, and yet he stands in for the Virgil-like figure Charles Jackson envisioned, the older man who would take Don deeper and deeper into, well, ""Birnam Wood"" (just like Shakespeare's Macbeth.)  The male nurse played by Frank Faylen keeps some of his queer camaraderie too, as he slaps down Don into a sort of bondage--all very friendly and palsy.  As the hero, Ray Milland shows that he was one of the best period actors.  Often mistaken for a lightweight, he has the loathsome imagination and fear of the very greatest actors.  He can imagine the horrors, and what the Hays Code wouldn't allow us to know for sure, the expressions of dumb lust and swank that play over Milland's face give us a different kind of evidence.  Wilder, in fact, was the master of a queer kind of cinema; has any other straight director made so many classics with lasting gay appeal?",1123113600,2,2282,4.717884130982368

  The acting is fantastic and you really feel the characters trying to cope with such self destruction.  But I feel this film has dated somewhat.  The Lost Weekend is a ""message"" film about the dangers of the bottle and it hits you on the head with it.  Also the ending is not quite what you'd expect in a modern film on this subject.  This film is not one of Wilder's best, and in my opinion is not a standout Academy Award Winner but is nevertheless a very good film and possibly a little ahead of its time.",1114560000,3,769,4.404255319148936
322812,5,6301005740,"Billy Wilder's powerful ""The Lost Weekend"", released 60 years ago, still resonates with profound impact in portraying the ravages of alcoholism.

Oscar winning Ray Milland is terrific playing failed writer Don Birnam a helpless and apparently hopeless alcoholic.  Having abstained from the bottle for 10 days, he's planning a weekend retreat to the country with his straight laced and supportive brother Wick, played by Phillip Harris.  His undeservedly doting girlfriend Helen  played by Jane Wyman is encouraging him to remain sober.  Despite all the support, the scheming Milland is manuevering to get out of going by spiriting his brother and girlfriend out to a concert.

He quickly ambles down to the neighborhood bar to commence an alcoholic binge which will last the entire weekend.  Wilder very graphically illuminates us as to the depths that the addicted Milland stoops to procure booze.  He pilfers a womans purse in a night club to play for his bar tab and gets caught.  Soon running out of money, he becomes desperate and winds up in a frightening hospital alcoholic ward.  He begins to suffer delirium tremors and hallucinations.  He flees from the hospital but is contemplating suicide as an escape from his problems.

Billy Wilder's expert direction is an extremely unsettling window into the sordid, unflattering lifestyle of the chronic alcoholic.  The scenes from the hospital ward were particularly terrifying.  Milland's performance probably represented the pinnacle of his acting career.  Howard da Silva, playing Nat the local barkeep and Frank Faylen, of Dobie Gillis fame, playing male nurse Bim both gave excellent performances.",1106092800,,1655,5.335907335907336
322813,5,6301005740,"A searing, powerful and no-holds barred depiction of the horrors of alcoholism, condensed into the events covering a long. four-day weekend. Almost sixty years after this film was made, it's message is clear and moving... When the film begins the main character is well into the alcoholic illness, and there is no hiding his predicament, nor his attempts to hide his illness from those around him. The film then explodes into all the various aspects of alcoholism, showing L.W's clearly defined dependeance on liquor... his  self hatred and disgust of his  weakness... showing the total degeneration and final degredation of a once, ambitious and talented individual to a ""bum"" om the streets and reduced to stealing in order to gain a drink. The ward scenes in a city hospital are particularly harrowing as is also the creation of the final descent into near madness with his own peculair brand of the D.T's.
A film made in a gritting realistic manner, and directed by Billy Wilder in a no-nonsense, "" straight at you "", style. The acting is superb, with Ray Milland making a major change in previous role types, to tackle the seriousness, drabness and despair of this person. And to me, that is the main strength of this film. It is written, acted and directed sympathetically, avoiding all inclinations to sensationalism, or exploitation. Ray Milland won a Best Actor Oscar for his role, and arguably never equalled that standard in later films. Not only concentrating on the central themse and its character, the film also shows the ""ripples"" ... the effect that the main character's actions and attitudes have on others. His girlfriend, sesnitively played by Jane Wyman is almost driven to abandoning him... a bartender constanty jeers, berates and mocks him.. a male nurse offers no noticeable help or advice; just quotes statistics and almost offers no hope for L.W. And in one jarring restaurant scene where L.W. has succumbed to stealing a woman's purse in order to gain money to pay for his meal; is caught out, thrown out of the restaurant as the patrons all stand and sing: ""Somebody Stole My Purse"".. to the tune of "" Somebody Stole My Gal"".
This DVD, I found, offers a good transfer, with sharp contrasts and a clear picture. The film now looks like new, although there is no ,mention of restoration anywhere. Good film to have in any collection, especially for the Oscar winning performance of Ray Milland.

  There is little stigma attached to the problem today as  compared to the self-loathing Milland felt & the repugnance the neighborhood & even his favorite bartender felt towards him.  In fact, the long, fairly one-sided conversations with Nat the bartender, played by Howard de Silva, are some of the best scenes in the movie.
  Brakett & Wilder took some chances in this ground-breaking movie. They fought the Hollywood studios who probably wanted it watered down & rendered more palatable. They didn't give in &, as a result, this was the best movie of the the year 1945. It was well deserved. Ray Milland also got an Oscar & he was never better. Jane Wyman does a fine job as his long suffering girl friend, Helen.
  It is unbelievable that that kind of woman, a real lady, would put up with a loser like that for so long. But after all, this is a movie. A pat ending that doesn't matter at all.

His mind takes him on a guilt-ridden trip through past experiences and hallucinations.  He even awakens after a spill down the stairs to find himself in the alcoholic wing of a sanitarium.
Billy Wilder's film adaptation of the novel by Charles Jackson does a fine job of detailing what happens to someone in the grips of alcoholism: the desparate need, the hallucinations, the blackouts, etc.  Ray Milland delivers one of the finest screen performances as Don, giving the impression that you are living every moment with Don, suffering his hallucinations and withdrawal, and thirsting for alcohol.  This performance also earned him the Best Actor Academy Award.  Jane Wyman is wonderful as Don's girlfriend Helen, who wants to see him through this terrible ordeal.  Phillip Terry also gives a strong performance as Don's brother Wick, who wants to help Don by being the strong one, but always caves in, feeding Don's dependency.

It's not due to some prejudice on my part about black and white cinematography: my inability to view many early films arises from the fact that far too many of these movies are so melodramatic. You know what I mean: lots of swooning, hands swept across foreheads, and exaggerated body movements all set to crashing waves of syrupy orchestral music. Those swelling violins alone are enough to set my teeth on edge anytime I watch an old film, but occasionally a picture overcomes all of these pet peeves of mine and truly delivers on multiple levels. ""The Lost Weekend"" is one of those films. Sure, the emoting is there, as is the music and the swooning, but this compelling story about an alcoholic at the end of his rope always pulls at my heartstrings. I am going to start seeking out some classic older films that will tickle my fancy, but I don't expect to find too many of them with the power of ""The Lost Weekend.""
Ray Milland (an actor who starred in several schlockfests at the end of his career, such as ""Frogs"") plays Don Birnam, a painfully insecure writer who just can't make his life work. Birnam quickly learned that the soothing balm of alcohol took the edge off his various phobias, but he just as quickly learned that drinking took the edge off his talent, too. For years, Birnam never wandered far from the neighborhood bar or the liquor store, secure in the knowledge that a bottle of rye was always within reach. His brother Wick not only financially supports his boozy sibling; he also covers for him when the drinking causes problems. Of course, Don doesn't care much about his brother one way or the other as long as he gets his shot of whisky when he needs it. Another problem for Don appears in the form of Helen St. James (played by an enormously cute Jane Wyman), a successful writer at Time magazine who accidentally met Don at the opera one night and has since latched on to him despite his chronic alcoholism. When Birnam isn't trying to outwit Wick or Helen, he's down at the local bar spouting alcoholic witticisms to Nat the bartender (played wonderfully by Howard Da Silva) and flirting with a beautiful barfly named Gloria. We learn most of the story through a flashback sequence told by Birnam as he ties on yet another massive drunk.
The film starts with a nervous Don packing for a weekend trip with brother Wick, where the two siblings hope to get out of New York City for a nice change of pace. Of course, Don doesn't want to go because he's not sure he can survive without ready access to booze. In fact, during this opening sequence we see Don hiding a bottle of whisky from his brother by hanging it from a piece of string outside his window. In order to start drinking, Birnam convinces Wick and Helen to go to a concert, a little piece of trickery that is only the beginning of the devious schemes hatched by Don throughout the film. Thus begins a downward spiral over the course of a four-day weekend, as Don resorts to outright theft, robbery, and beggary in order to secure just one more drink. This bender comes with a high price, though: Don suffers excruciating blackouts, nearly gets himself arrested, and ends up in the alky ward at the city asylum. The capper is Birnam's bout with the DTs in his apartment, an incident that reduces him to a shattered, screaming wreck. ""The Lost Weekend"" is a memorable experience.
Only a person who has never had a problem with alcohol would criticize some of Birnam's philosophical musings about drinking. There is a great bit of dialogue where Birnam tells Nat why he drinks, about how alcohol makes a person feel as though he or she is a great artist on top of the world. Believe me, this is how an alcoholic feels when they tie one on, at least in the early euphoric stages of the addiction. Birnam's enthrallment for rituals of drinking is also dead on; such as his fascination about the rings the shot glass leaves on the bar and the propensity to ""see"" liquor in the most mundane circumstances (look for the dancing raincoats with the rye bottle in the pocket). An alcoholic does not merely work at his trade part-time; the process of drinking is a full-time job built on a series of elaborate rituals that reinforce this nefarious addiction. ""The Lost Weekend"" captures the intricacies of alcoholism in a way few films ever have. Unfortunately, the movie lost some of its power due to some hokey effects and a conclusion that had me throwing my hands up in disbelief.
The DVD release is quite good for a film nearly sixty years old. There is a trailer and cast biographies included here, as well as a short bio for director Billy Wilder. The transfer looks pretty good, although I thought I saw a few scenes where certain parts of the picture looked a tad blurry. ""The Lost Weekend"" won four Oscars: Best Actor for Ray Milland, Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Director for Billy Wilder. As far as I can see, this movie deserves its accolades. If you haven't seen ""The Lost Weekend,"" you are definitely missing out on a great film loaded with grim atmosphere, great dialogue, eerie background music, and excellent performances.",1063238400,12,5209,4.608180839612486
322818,5,6301005740,"I can understand why the studio did not want to release ""The Lost Weekend"" in 1945: it's a gritty and realistic (sometimes horrifyingly so) account of an alcoholic's weekend binge. Going against years of movies that portrayed drunkeness as something cute and harmless, this movie pulls no punches in illustrating to what depths a man will stoop when he just has to have a drink.
There's a story told about the filming of ""LW,"" in which another of Ray Milland's on-the-street takes were ruined when someone recognized him. Instead of asking for his autograph, though, the woman offered to bring him back to her apartment for a drink. She didn't believe him when he said he was making a movie about a drunk; she thought the actor was down on his luck and really *was* a drunk. Billy Wilder came out from behind the hidden camera and finally set her straight. This is a good illustration of the power of Milland's performance; his work is quite extraordinary. Jane Wyman as his girlfriend Helen does a good job with a small role, as does Phillip Terry as Don's brother Wick.
While the drama of the movie moves along at a fevered pitch, it really starts to build to a level of unbearable tension when Helen goes to retrieve her coat (which Don has stolen) from the pawnbroker, only to discover Don didn't trade it for money for booze, but rather a gun he had pawned earlier. After his earlier talk of putting a bullet through his head, the audience and Helen realize at the same time what his intentions are, and we find ourselves as anxious as Helen as she races back to his apartment. She gets there in time, and the two play a game of cat and mouse, warily stepping around each other as he tries to get her to leave, and she tries to get to the gun first.
After winding things up so tightly, though, the movie ends with an anti-climax: Helen gives Don her same old inspirational speech about his having the talent to make a go of it as a writer, and suddenly, this time he believes her, vowing once again (and we're to assume that this time it took) to give up drinking and make something of himself. He gives us a pat little explanation of his alcoholism, and ends by saying gee, he feels sorry for all those other drunks out in NYC that think they're fooling everyone. Fade to black.
I realize this is a typical Hollywood ending of the time (1945), with everything working out okay in the end, but I felt cheated. I had been so captivated by this true to life story, with nothing glossed over, that the ending didn't ring true at all. Strange as it may sound, I think I would have almost preferred Don to put a bullet in his head. It would have felt much more realistic than him basically saying, ""You're right Helen, I will stop drinking and write that book,"" and with a snap of the fingers, put his drunken ways behind him.
This is my only complaint about the movie, and it is an extremely small one; don't let my thoughts about the ending stop you from watching this film. It is an astonishing movie even in this day and age, even more so when you consider it was made almost 60 years ago.",1044489600,66,3093,4.409090909090909
322819,5,6301005740,"Billy Wilder electrified the film world in 1944 with his brutally realistic film about lust and greed, ""Double Indemnity.""  Just one year later he reemerged with another compelling tale from life's dark side, ""The Lost Weekend.""  In the 1945 Oscar sweepstakes ""Weekend"" exceeded his preceding breakthrough film by sweeping all the major categories of Best Film, Best Actor, with British star Ray Milland delivering his role of a lifetime, Best Director for the crafty Wilder,and Best Adapted Screenplay with Wilder sharing honors with longtime partner Charles Brackett from a hard-hitting bestseller penned by Charles Jackson.
The main action surrounds a fall weekend in which presumably recovering alcoholic Milland is to accompany brother Phillip Terry to Penn Station and a presumably quiet weekend in the country.  Instead he sneaks out of his New York apartment and  enters a journey into the bowels of hell.  The haunting musical score by Miklos Rosza depicts the urgency of the moment, resembling that of his masterwork ""Spellbound.""  The black and white photography is intentionally gray and brooding throughout, focusing on New York's streets.  Milland experiences the ultimate in desperation, spending time in the city's drunk ward, observing hallucinations in the form of a rat on his wall and vultures flying overhead, appropriate symbols of his desperation state, and failing to obtain needed alcoholic succor at a critical interval due to the closing of liquor stores due to the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday.
While Milland is superb in his presentation of a frightened would be novelist whose cleverness makes it more difficult than ever to keep his sought after rye whiskey away from him, a constellation of talented players assist in generating a bona fide Hollywood classic.  Phillip Terry plays his loving, brooding brother with just the proper measure of anger merging with frustration.  Jane Wyman is excellent as his sensitively attuned, intelligent girlfriend determined to spare him from ultimate self-destruction.  Howard di Silva plays the outwardly hard-bitten, inwardly caring bartender with consummate skill.  He emerges with one of the film's most memorable lines when, after pouring Milland a drink, he exclaims, ""If you had enough money you'd kill yourself in a month.""  Doris Dowling is brilliant as a lonely prostitute living off the largesse of lonely older men who dreams of a better life and romance with Milland, who seeks to borrow money from her when his liquor and financial resources vanish.
Wilder proves in this film, as he did earlier with ""Double Indemnity"" and later with ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""The Apartment"" that he was one of the cinema's reigning masters of the rugged, hard-edged side of human experience.  This is a cannot miss dramatic masterpiece which never fails to find the mark.",1040256000,7,2834,5.299107142857143
322820,4,6301005740,"It's hard to believe that this movie was produced in 1945, a year which introduced Americans to the twin horrors of the Nazi concentration camps and the effects of the atomic bomb. Although the later two concerns have been greatly distanced from our current social and political conscienceness,  the widespread plague of alcoholism remains painfully relevant.
  Being a recovering alcoholic myself, I am amazed at how openly Bily Wilder shows us the uglier sides of the alcoholic personality: the lying, the stealing, the self-righteous anger towards anyone or anything that interferes with our drinking. This movie goes WAY outside the comfort zone of American society at that time. The fact that it was a box office success and won 4 Oscars cknowledges that, even then, America knew that it had a problem of epidemic proportions on its hands.
  All of the grim realities of a binge are portrayed here: the blackouts,  the depression, the panic, even the DTs. Ray Milland gives the performance of his life in the Lost Weekend, a man perched on the perimeter of his own damaged psyche. This film, much more than many of the preachy videos curently employed in treatment centers, can help a struggling alcoholic  to take a hard lok in the mirror, and possibly help them want to make a change for the better.
  Several modern films  may capture the details of alcoholism more acurately (Leaving Las Vegas tops the list), but none of these would ever have been made without the groundwork laid by The Lost Weekend.",1025913600,5,1511,4.890196078431373

322824,5,6301005740,"Alcoholism has been seen on movies for a very long time. Many people just haven't realized it because it was never something to care much for. Drinking was often the stuff of comedy. This was because most of what we saw about it was the effects while someone was drunk and making fools of themselves. In 1945, director Billy Wilder made a film called ""The Lost Weekend"", that dealt with the subject in a different light. The movie was not expected to be a hit, having been a controversial project and being poorly received by preview audiences. But it turned out to be a surprise hit with critics and won academy awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actor.  Here are some reasons as to why this movie is great, along with some of its cons.
""You know, the circle is the perfect geometric figure. No end, no beginning."" The figure of a circle is used often in the movie, primarily in the plot. The story revolves around that of a failed writer (Ray Milland, who I discuss in detail later) and his trouble with alcohol. The usage of a circular plot structure suggests that the life of a drunk is followed by one binge after another, with no start and no finish. It is also used when Don is under alcohol's spell. An example is the usage of rings from the shot glasses to show passage of time.
The lead performance: After years of acting, Milland hit it big as Don Birnam, the unsuccessful, alcoholic writer who goes on a drinking binge (""I'm not a drinker, I'm a drunk""). Milland's character is a tortured one, who claims that there are, figuratively, two of him: Don the writer and Don drunk. Milland can be melodramatic in his performance, but what do you expect from a film like this? One has to congratulate Milland for having the guts to take this role, for his character is a liar and thief who only cares about and will do anything for one more drink. It is amazing how he is able to be despicable and still allow us to sympathize with his character. Like many male leads in Wilder's films, Don Brinam is flawed in how he is weak and, though he tries not to, easily succumbs to the bottle (""The reason is me- what I am, or rather what I'm not). Though other great male performances were done in 1945, Milland was deserving of his Oscar.
Supporting Cast: Jane Wyman, as Don's girl Helen, is not as involved, in my humble opinion, as Milland is, but is still able to turn out well. The problem is that her character doesn't get to do much, except try to talk to Don when he is hungover. The supporting cast does better, starting with Wick (Phillip Terry), Don's caring and dedicated brother, who is annoyed by his drinking yet allows him to stay at his apartment (""I went over the apartment with a fine-tooth comb - the places he can figure out""). A scene-stealer is Nat (Howard da Silva), a bartender who is friendly to Don but is also irritated by his unkindness to women and his alcoholism (""One's too many and a hundred's not enough!""). There is also Gloria (Doris Dowling), a slim, attractive woman who visits Nat's place to wait for other men. (She is most likely a female escort). She uses a lot of word abbreviations, such as ""ridick"" for ridiculous or ""natch"" for naturally. My favorite appearance was by an uncredited Frank Faylen as ""Bim"", a [seemingly] homosexual male nurse at an alcoholic ward called ""Hangover Plaza"". He sets the stage for Don by telling him ""...you're just a freshman. Wait'll you're a sophomore. That's when you start seeing the little animals.""
Feel: The movie's black and white cinematography is shot in a way that it presents the feeling of a nightmare. This way is difficult to explain, except that this illusion is presented most effectively in black and white and would be lost in a color film. This is probably because B & W, I think, is more moody. It's also interesting how several scenes are shot through whiskey bottles or shot glasses.
Music Score: It seems odd to talk about the music, but it is important. It was the first to use a theremin, an instrument that produces a strange wailing sound. Used in the nightmare scenes, it would later be familiar with fans of `50's sci-fi films. However, the non-thermin score is also one of the few downsides. Sometimes, especially during the opening credits, it feels too upbeat, too much like a film noir.
 ""The Lost Weekend"" is by no means a cheerful movie. It does have some great dialogue (A trademark of Wilder films), but overall it's as entertaining and upbeat as a brain tumor. In addition to being depressing, it's also melodramatic, but that's a minor problem. I rather have a movie that tries to go for realism and honesty in this subject. Also, being a nearly 60 year-old movie and a groundbreaker in this subject, it is bound to have dated in some respects.
(Major plot spoilers ahead) But wait, am I a hypocrite? After all, it can be said that the ending feels too upbeat and optimistic. Many complain about this and it does indeed seem to be like this. But is it? A person who is a heavy drinker, I think, can't stop in the blink of an eye. However, this time he has a cause and an idea for writing and that will definitely help him.
A mixed bag, no doubt. But there is more good than bad. This is one that grows with repeated viewing.  Wilder was certainly a great director, one who could make you as easily affected as he could make you laugh. He will be missed very much.",1021420800,19,5408,4.499491353001018
322825,5,6301005740,"The Lost Weekend brought Billy Wilder the first two of his many Academy Awards.  The film is a brilliant look at the life of a man who is not a drinker, but a full blown drunk.  Ray Milland stars as Don Birnam who is trying to stay dry.  His girlfriend, played by Jane Wyman, has enlisted the help of Don's brother and for a while, Don deals with his situation.  But slowly and surely, his demons get the best of him and he heads down to his local watering hole and goes on a bender.  The decent of Don into his alcoholic hell is probably the most terrifying and griping portrayals of alcoholism ever committed to the screen.  Mr. Milland is absolutely brilliant and he avoids overplaying the role.  He could have easily hammed it up by over emoting, but he goes to just the right level without ever going over the line.  Mr. Milland took home the 1945 Best Actor Oscar in addition to Mr. Wilder's Best Director and Writing Awards and the film won for Best Picture.  The film shows the master that Mr. Wilder is, as he was able to coax the brilliant performance out of Mr. Milland who was nothing more than a B-list actor up until The Lost Weekend and never really capitalized on the role after.",1009324800,8,1195,4.346846846846847

322830,4,6301005740,"Ray Milland is not really thought of as a great actor. He was a fine, competent leading man, but he rarely gave an outstanding performance. Lost Weekend shows that he was a far better actor than was usually apparent. Milland's performance is wonderfully realistic and daring also, for his character is not especially sympathetic. There is no glamour in the situations he faces. He is dirty, seedy and at times obnoxious. This is a portrait of a drunk which was and is untypical. Most often drunks are portrayed as comic characters, but there is little humour in the life shown in Lost Weekend, only degradation.
This all rather makes the film sound dull and unappealing. It is anything but. Often with Billy Wilder's films it is the dialogue which is most memorable and Lost Weekend has some great lines. I particularly enjoyed the language and forties slang of sympathetic bad girl Doris Dowling. It seems amazing that Wilder, who co-wrote the film, grew up in Austria. He must have really listened to those around him to pick up all the nuances of contemporary speech.
I would not say that Lost Weekend is Wilder's best film. The story is a little bit too predictable. This is always the case with message films. Here the message is the horrors of alcoholism, so we rather know where we're going. Nevertheless it is a fine film by one of the finest directors ever.
The quality of the DVD is very good. It has few extras, just a trailer really, but the quality of the picture and sound is superb. My only quibble is with Universal who issue the DVD and no doubt own the rights to the film. They should not put their globe symbol at the beginning of the film in front of the Paramount mountain. This might seem petty, but it is still `A Paramount Picture' whoever owns it now.",988329600,54,1776,4.588050314465409

322832,2,6301005740,"'The Lost Weekend' leaves a lot of fascinating questions unanswered - for instance, why wasn't Don 'Lester' Burnam fighting in the war?  There are some remarkable sequences here, in particular the opera scene nodding to Chaplin's 'The Gold Rush', or the Kafkaesque purse-snatching incident.  Throughout, Wilder emphasises the circle, the vicious circle, the noose, encircling even the narrative, ironising any 'cop out' move towards resolution, which, based on pure talk, has no solidity.  This is one that will go on and on, ending only in death or madness.
Still, this is Wilder's most overrated film, as dated in dialogue, assumptions and wearisome drunk hero as a Eugene O'Neill play; while the visual 'daring' now looks frequently risible.  For a genuinely moving portrayal of a drunk, catch Melville's 'Deux Hommes Dans Manhatten'.",982108800,5,837,5.366412213740458
322833,5,6301005740,"""The lost weekend"" was a great adaption of Charles Jackson same name novel. Billy Wilder's terrific directing always a bonus.  It's about a struggling writer's weekend. Everything happened over a weekend.
The film began with Don pretend to pack his luggage with a bottle tied to a string hanging outside his window. Don's life and fate changed. Don Birnam has writer's block, he is also a alcoholic. He is aware but unable to kick it. He even trade his typewriter for drinks. He been through a lot in a few days and forced to face up to his problem. Luckily he has love and support from his brother and girlfriend.
Ray Milland gave a splendid performance which totally deserved his oscar. He showed Don's fear, depression and all his emotions so vividly.  His role is pathetic and psychologically realistic.
This film has a superb script with detailed description of nightmares images and visions. Breakthrough during that era.  One of the memorable scene is when Don went to a musical play with actors drinking and he see 'Bottles dancing' instead.
Although this film is black and white I find it amazingly well made and many contemporary movies couldn't hold a candle.
I'm always fascinated by old classic film from 1940  to 1970. Although I belong to new generation I love the feeling and sincerity of old movies.
