8666944,4,B00LNJDEZ0,"This was quite a surprise to find out Wagner the purported ""arch anti-semite"" was surrounded by and dependent on so many talented Jews. A very well done documentary, worth a second watch and provides an explanation; though brief of Hitler's association with the Wagner family. Well done.",1423958400,5,287,5.127659574468085

8666947,5,B00LNJDEZ0,"A tremendously interesting and moving 55 minutes, aided in no small measure by a soundtrack of Wagnerian hit tunes. Although I knew of the contradiction between Wagner the anti-Semite and Wagner the man who had many Jewish friends and associates, the documentary reveals the contradiction as far more extreme than I had imagined. By that I mean Wagner was a far more vicious anti-Semite than I had imagined, at least in what he expressed in writing and speeches. But Wagner's amiable association with many Jews was also far more extensive than I had realized. The documentary quotes from letters and writings of the principle figures, putting much of the narrative in the first person and making the people and story come alive. In contrast to a commonplace criticism of Wagner's operas, there are no dull stretches in this story.",1415145600,9,830,4.9784172661870505
8666948,4,B00LNJDEZ0,"The late 19th century composer Richard Wagner was an admitted anti-Semite and wrote aniti-Semitic articles and yet he attracted Jewish musicians. As this short (but interesting) documentary opens we learn about a concert of Wagnerian music that is being banned in Israel and the struggle by Jewish musicians to have the music heard. Using interviews with biographers, historians and musicians (including Zubin Mehta), the film tells the back story of Wagner and his opinions and how Hitler used his music to engage his supporters.

Im honestly not a big Wagner music  fan  I never have been  but I found this an interesting DVD to watch and classical music lovers will find it even more relevant to them. The bonuses include extended interviews that add another 25 minutes but a complete musical performance that is only excerpted in the film.

Another fine addition to the Classical Music documentart series from First Run Features.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
