7031526,1,B00UA86G5U,"Wow! Im amazed that this documentary has 4 stars. I used to love ancient aliens (the first season before it was revived) because it allowed ancient alien theorist and scientist to discuss there position on unknown events. Each person used evidence to back their claims which made you do research on those topics as well. This however, HAHA!!! Is absolutely non-sense! Within the first 5 minute this guy trys to invalidate the Big Bang theory with absolutely no evidence to back his claim. He also goes in to say global warming is fake and was created to push through a tax bill; his evidence you ask? HAHA! There is a 10th planet in our solar system that the elite don't want you to know about, HAHA! Ok first if you even did the slightest research our planets and or ancient aliens, you would stumble across companies like NASA that stated there is another plant in our solar system further out the Pluto. He goes on to state the earth is is heating up due to unknown forces coming from the secret planet; but he has evidence HAHA! His evidence!? Ice caps on mars and some moons of Jupiter are melting hahahahahahahahahahahahah!!! Omg! He has no eveodence to state any of his claims. Like at all ZERO. Oh man I watched this whole documentary and laughed all the way through. Look Im all for ancient aliens and untold history but there needs to be better evidence backing the claims then the elites don't want you to know or the government is hiding/censoring information. This comedy is released, in the worst year for facts checking and evidence gathering in the U.S.A.

7031533,4,B00UA86G5U,"I liked this program. I feel it is too conspiracy oriented. Other than that, over the years I have picked up most of the knowledge contained
within, here and there. I suggest you watch it, since, most of this knowledge will not be found in a broadsheet newspaper.

Alien races do exist. I have even seen one, those that are called 'grays.' My writing this shows that this is not the old days when government
would not allow dissent, or divergence from the stated consensus reality.

I also know that everyone in the conspiracy movement are not good people. That I know from my own research. So spare me the nobility.

There is certainly a war between good and evil going on. There are entities on both sides of this conflict, who are at a higher level of
development than world governments.

The law of karma does exist. If you do things for others, and also pay off your karmic debt - you will progress. There was no mention of this
in this program. This forum I am writing on has much knowledge on spirituality - Christian or otherwise.

So what is the average citizen supposed to do? Competence is certainly helpful. I would suggest starting somewhere on the path to
spiritual development. Why not buy a copy of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras and see that wisdom does exist. Hard work and vision does pay off,
eventually.

Where I feel that the program was accurate was the notion of a world order. I see it happening as we speak, that with immigration patterns
and other things which I am quite certain the OSS (Office Of Strategic Services) did - that America and Canada even. are changing.

We are not the centre of the universe. We are not even alone in this universe. Galileo got into trouble saying certain things, but as I said;
times change.

My final point is that working 20 hours a day, for thirty years does not constitute an elite - it constitutes a meritocracy. Another thing that
should be studied is shamanism. Start with the works of Castaneda.

Good luck and God Bless!",1507420800,,1983,4.547752808988764

It's an unfortunate mix and the viewer really has to be on the ball with this guy.

7031544,1,B00UA86G5U,"I laughed it off at the ""Sekmet"" sucked the energy out of the camera part.  The stupid overload blew the circuits at that point.
The picture that caught that was shooting in the low light area and so it had a shutter open for far longer than normal. The woman taking that picture who is show in the picture this ""Bill Mars"" numb skull is talking about had just had their camera up high and pulled it down when the person who took the photo clicked the shutter, the light trail is absolutely 1100% without a doubt caused by the long shutter time of the camera taking the photo. It would have easily occurred in a shutter time of less than 1/2 second. It is easy to duplicate.

Yes there were giants, yes there was advanced technology, yes there were half man half beast type creatures from legends but it is all tied to the Bible and the reason for Noah's flood. The giants and the ancient aliens are well known to be the fallen angels, demons and the likes, Nothing more.... Period.

All of these other extreme conspiracy theories are just another way to make money repeatedly from morons who cannot think for themselves by making video after video after video that show these well known Biblical historical things as something related to Aliens. Funny though, the whole premise is that some alien put us here, left us, may have enslaved us at some point and is returning to make us perfect some day. All of this is simply what we were told in the Bible was coming or happened but altered to take out God.

People are willing to listen to these stories and call it fake if it has ""God"" in it but take the same exact story and replace ""God"" with ""Alien"" and they will eat it up and believe it. All of this genetic modification and coming deception is about a future free of evil in a body that cannot die, We are already getting that, God told us that but that isn't good enough, these people want that without any accountability for their evil and immoral actions.",1504051200,3,1964,4.402203856749312

7031552,2,B00UA86G5U,"With this review (along with some other recent ones) I'm trying something new. I'm going to give a NEGATIVE POINT about the film, then a POSITIVE POINT about it. That way people who read the review won't think I'm just harping on it if all they read was the negatives, or be mislead by only the positives. I think this way it's a ""balanced"" type of review. Plus, those who don't FINISH the whole review might at least get 1 positive along WITH a negative haha! Either way, I just want you to be the most informed you can be by the end of it! Thanks for reading!

NEGATIVE POINT: The Title (It may seem like a small issue, but in some instances, like this one, it can be HUGE!)
This negative point, and the next one are my biggest negatives really. I have the belief that having a ""name"" of an already famous/running show/movie series (especially at the beginning of the title which is like a very basic introduction to the movie) is kind of like cheating, you know? It's almost like piggy-backing in my OWN opinion. It may not be yours, but it's how I feel. Anyways, that's kind of what happened with this movie for me. I wasn't too sure about the title so I watched the preview, and even then it was a little misleading because it didn't really have any of the ""interview"" style scenes that are prevalent throughout this picture; that's why I say ""misleading"" (more on the PREVIEW later). So, to me, having the main part/beginning of the title be ""Ancient Aliens"" means you're kind of linking UP with, or have something to DO with the very famous. long running, 12 season/12 year old television show ""Ancient Aliens"". A lot of times it's how the title for the movie is PHRASED. If the movie had the title ""CSI: Memphis"" The first thing that'd pop into my head would be a branch off of the very famous ""CSI"" franchise, but set in Memphis, TN; NOT a 1 person ""expert"" interview style movie on the techniques used by the Memphis branch's Crime Scene Investigators. Or, if the title was phrased ""PICK A SHOW"", then a "":"", then ""ADJECTIVE NOUN VERB, etc"", you'd PROBABLY be led to believe that it has to do with whatever show it says, and the description sentence after has to do with how it effects YOUR show. NOT an interview style show with 1 ""expert"" where the show is kind of put together like a video essay. So, titles can be misleading if not done, or phrased right. It should've been Titled ""A New World Order: Ancient Alien Theory"", or something like that. Just like the other should've been titled ""Memphis' CSI"", or ""ADJECTIVE NOUN VERB: PICK A SHOW"". Just reorder the words so we get a better picture of what's ACTUALLY in the movie, and what the movie is ACTUALLY about you know?
POSITIVE: Narration
So this movie isn't an Ancient Aliens flick, oh well. The narrator actually does a really good job at narrating the movie! Not only that, but the information, and opinions he gives, and sets up are easy to understand, and follow. With so many of these types of shows (i.e. aliens, UFOs, ghosts, paranormal, etc) the narration for whatever point trying to be made, or message conveyed can be QUIET a disservice, because if it's disjointed, overzealous, jumps around, a bad voice actor, sound cheesy, etc; it just makes it come across as more ""conspiracy theory"" junk. This guy does a pretty good job at staying on point, at not sounding crazy (I know that's a weird/funny one, but it's really important haha!), and at segwaying to his next speaking point. This turns what could very easily be just another conspiracy theory garbage flick into a pretty good ""explanation movie"". He's not trying to MAKE you believe anything; he's just presenting. Which is nice.
NEGATIVE POINT: The Preview
The preview didn't actually show, or get across that this was a ""video essay"" type movie with just the 1 person, and his opinions, and researched facts, and had nothing to do with the television show ""Ancient Aliens"". The preview showed what LOOKED like what could've been mistaken for an episode of the television show ""Ancient Aliens"". So, the preview was also misleading, and therefore caused a problem. You add a misleading preview, and a misleading name, and you get a ""purchase let-down"". ***Sad Face***
POSITIVE POINT: The Information
A lot of people who watched this probably did because they thought it was part of the ""Ancient Aliens"" repertoire, and having done so were let down by the fact that they'd already heard/seen everything presented in this film quiet a few times, from quiet a few episodes of ""AA"". They probably got bored, and gave it a 1 star SOLELY on the fact that they already KNEW all of it. Well, you can't do that! If you've seen 1 horror movie, you've seen the all haha. Don't split up, and don't go in the basement! Haha! But, for those who haven't seen the ""AA"" television show, missed a few episodes, forgot some stuff, could use refreshers, are completely new to the topic, etc then all the information in this movie was great! It was well spoken, and versed. Coupled with the narration the information was presented in a very plain, and easy to understand way, and like I said before if you didn't KNOW some of it then I'm sure it's entertaining for you. Again, we've all seen horror movies, sports movies, underdog movies, ""chick flicks, and a million other types, and we know what's going to happen. It doesn't mean you give them all 0's, and 1's. Just because this is in documentary style doesn't mean it should be judged harsher right? It has good information for the layman, or for those who need a refresher course is all I'm saying haha.
NEGATIVE ISSUE: Quality
Because it's a documentary type movie it isn't going to have a big 30mil Hollywood budget by any stretch. I knew that going into it even when I thought it was part of the ""AA"" universe because even though they have some great graphics, and use high tech equipment it's still just documentary-ish, and they still use quiet a bit of stock footage. So it doesn't HAVE to be to be entertaining in the ""Michael Bay"" way with high graphic explosions, and CGI haha, BUT if I'm going to be somewhat ""misled"" into watching the show then maybe provide some parts interwoven throughout to breakup the monotony of it. Even ""AA"" has great music, uses high tech cameras, and doesn't use the same stock footage everyone else uses. The interview style of him at his desk giving an opinion then panning to stock NASA footage of Earth from space, and back to him again reciting facts/information that I've heard before then panning to another stock video of a wide angle shot of some 8th world wonder gets old about 10 minutes in. Maybe it's because I've been interested in the ""Ancient Alien"" theory for years now, have SEEN the television show with the same name ""Ancient Aliens"", and have done my own research so any of the facts, research, and opinions were things I'd heard before quiet a few times? Dress it up a bit maybe? Again, it's just my own opinion.
CONCLUSION: 2 Stars
Because it had more NEGATIVE POINTS than POSITIVE POINTS for me, I'd heard all the information before so I wasn't getting anything new from it, it wasn't very entertaining, and worse it not only had a misleading title, but also a misleading preview, this movie went to 2 stars. A lot of people get confused about the star rating though. The star rating is MY opinion about the movie. So if you're new to the Ancient Alien Theory I'd say give it a shot. It's a nice, painless, crazy-less introduction into the universe of Ancient Alien Theory, and YOU may get a lot more out of it than I did. As far as information, and opinions go anyways. It still has a lack of ""oopmh"" in the entertainment department, but who knows maybe the information will keep you SO intrigued you won't even notice?! Haha! Anyways, thanks for reading! I hope this helped.

Over two decades ago, I used to watch everything I could on ancient aliens, ancient civilizations, end of the world, you name it, but stopped years ago. Life happened. But, I would always catch a few on cable television before reality tv took over. Those days are long gone, and as I recently cut the cable and went with subscriptions, I found a lot of docs to add to my watchlist.

I thoroughly enjoyed this. Perhaps it's been so long since I've seen anything on the subject and that's why I thought it was great, but I think it more because of how the subject matter and ideas were presented.

After a billion,  what else would you possibly need yet the keep going back for more.  To escape a cataclysmic event,  I would guess they will go to a very very expensive hidden moon base.  Have to wonder,  why no space station there and why don't we go back,  supposedly.  Its about 1 millimeter in space distance and its perfectly usable,  but not even spoken of.  No way thats true.  It sure would cost a ton of money though.  Purposely shorting the market,  and then in turn tanking the market because you shorted it seems to work well.  Just a fun guess.

""Just a theory"" remains one of he most inane and idiotic memes that pervades all of under-educated society, like an insidious cancer.

Building on his predecessors (whom he references profusely as a pretense to scholarship), Marrs provides the standard issue rambling incoherence of post-1900 conspiracy mongering. Ancient civilizations, Templars, Freemasons, International banks, Aliens, Nazis, JFK, crop circles, 911, Iraq wars and a media conspiracy to cover it all up.

Yup, perfectly reasonable.

Despite apparent years of ""research"" by Marrs, his ideas don't rise to levels reached by my drunk, paranoiac and cantankerous father in law.  Watch out for the Jesuit hiding behind the bookcase!

Pseudo-documentaries like this stand as a warning to those who investigate too many subjects without ever going beyond the surface of any one of them.

Result?  Early senility

Lesson: study any subject IN DEPTH instead (which takes decades, after the 4 years); if Physics, then you'll be able to TEST and actually determine that the moon is not hollow, or perhaps determine that optical effects can derail an observation until properly understood; if Archaeology, then you'll be able to TEST and determine that aliens are not necessary to build megalithic structures; if technology and history, then you'll be able to determine that UFO sightings are likely of military aircraft; if Psychology, you will see the power of myth; if Mathematics, then you'll perceive the actual, REAL connection among all things.

Listening to Jim Marrs talk about melting ice caps on Mars (lol) and the Illuminati is truly tin hat material. I had to turn it off when he stated that nobody paid attention to the Tea Party rallies of 2010. First of all, how does that relate to ufology or the paranormal? He tries to make a connection, but...it was very sketchy. Secondly, I watched the coverage of Tea Party rallies, and I have to say, I did not see the kind of selective journalism he accuses. He also stated that Barack Obama instituted new policies (which Marrs, of course, opposes) in 2006. I'm sorry, but if you're going to make these sweeping allegations, maybe you can get your year right? Obama wasn't president until 2008. This is NOT the kind of real ufo and alien research I've come to expect.

Of course IMDB would give this a 2.9 and Hateful 8 a 9. This just shows you how completely skewed the average intelligence of the United States has become.

You can't call Jim crazy, he absolutely is not. Unlike other researchers in this field, nothing Jim says is ""channeled"" or things he just makes up. Everything he says has documented backing, and if you've ever read one of his books, he fills the index with all his reference material for verification. He follows this pattern in his videos and after stating an seemingly outrageous statement, he quickly follows with where he acquired that information.",1454544000,27,778,4.678832116788321

7031817,2,B00UA86G5U,"Kind of a fan of the genre here, so it's from that vantage point that I write.

Pros:  Guy has a really cool hat, and a well manicured beard.

Cons:  Hard to ""believe"" when the story jumps around so erratically, and loads of theories with no proof are provided.

Let's face facts here, this kind of film is basically old fashioned story telling.  With an elder, or some other expert, telling us of fantastic things that no one has experienced or knows but he/she.  But to do this right you have to have a really solid story, and in the age of the internet so many of what this fellow says are easily falsifiable.

The better approach is to string together a coherent theory/story that's wild and cool, but also fits many observations. It should fit neatly into gaps in experimental evidence and observations (and lets face it, science abounds with those).  A good story is based on this concept!  It has to be believable!  To help, you can add lots of corroborating, but weak, evidence too (like all that Sumerian stuff this film trots out).

Still....like I said I'll give it two out of respect for the genre.  I think with a better tale this actor could do this well BTW.

So c'mon guys...tell me a GOOD story!  :-)",1453161600,5,1217,4.468181818181818

The fact that the wealth of the world is controlled by 1% is provable. All you have to do is literally follow the money. The fact that ancient technologies of free-energy would definitely put a leak in the 1%'s coffers is absolute. Here we are in 2018 and despite all the technological advances we have in medicine, space, materials, communications, we still propel ourselves with 18-century piston-driven fossil fuel dependent technology.

The bottomline for me is Jim speaks the truth and if he's not 100% he's at least 90% correct.",1530662400,,648,4.9

8704901,3,B00UA86G5U,"...I almost left this documentary after the first 10 minutes because it sounded like it was going to be conservative and one sided. But I pushed through that notion and eventually it started to pan out to something more. Again, I always try to listen to these types of docs, as they often present thoughts or info I haven't heard before, or have forgotten. So it's always good to avoid prejudging these somewhat 'conspiracy' motivated films until the last straw has been broken. I would actually give this film a 3.5 star rating as a lot of it is rehashed info, but there are several grains of decent content that seems to be new info and it makes sense.

Except for this one. It doesn't bring up anything interesting except the Jurassic Park guy with the limited vocabulary and horrific understanding of indisputable elements that form the basis for all branches and disciplines of science. Within ten minutes the guy has relegated the term theory to the mental gray zone called a guess then moves directly into comparing the martian climate (as in the climate on the planet Mars) to the climate of the Earth as evidence Al Gore is trying to tax people for his own benefit.

The little fella is just all over the place and most of what isn't political commentary is paraphrased from much older research on the subject or smply a bunch of words strung together in a way that's consistent with a stroke or seizure.
