who bravely went to execution instead of re-canting their beliefs or turning
on others.

The film focuses on the five days between Sophie's arrest and execution, and her
relationships in her prison (a converted mansion) especially with a older fellow woman
prisoner who comes to care for her.

While I quite liked the film, somehow I wasn't moved as much as I felt I should be, and
I never felt really inside Sophie's head.  Some of her dialogue felt more like polemic
speeches than a human being facing death for her beliefs.  The acting is generally quite
good but never transcended into great.

It is thought provoking to see Germans who hated what their government was doing
during the Nazi years.  But there are some annoying cinematic techniques that just feel
intrusive, like the black between each short scene.  It's an effect I've liked, in certain films, but
I wasn't sure what it was adding here.

In the big picture, I think my frustration is that the film starts so strongly, I wanted to walk
away with a deeper experience than I did.  Still for any flaws, worth seeking out.",1343260800,,1164,4.751243781094527
7851050,5,6303593585,"Three films have been made about Sophie Scholl's anti-Nazi activities in 1943 Munich - The Last Five Days, White Rose, and Sophie Scholl: the Final Days.  You might think that three movies about the same story are two too many but not at all.  They are all exceptional and this captivating story just draws the viewer in asking for more.  Why isn't this available on DVD?",1243468800,,371,4.590909090909091
7851051,5,6303593585,"I understand that a new film about Sophie Scholl has just been

made (indeed it was recommended for an Oscar) but why redo a masterpiece. This is a quiet film about a German woman who was attending the University of Munich who believed that other Germans needed to be made aware of the Nazi atrocities. She

formed an amateur organization which distributed leaflets of protest...and for this crime, she was sentenced to die by

Guillotine.  The film details ""her five last days in prison.""

Some are unaffected by her modest courage; others are deeply moved and try to give her simple comfort.  Quite simply the finest prison film ever made.  Absolutely five stars.  For those who need some background, there is a good German Film ""The White Rose"" which gives valuable historical detail of her

organization including the facts how she was caught. But this film is a masterpiece of her radiant martyrdom.",1139356800,4,904,4.856209150326797
