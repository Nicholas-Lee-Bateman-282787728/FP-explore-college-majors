1064238,4,6305701261,"I'm at a bit of a loss to explain what I thought about SEVEN CHANCES (1925) as a whole, because I had such a mixed reaction to it.  The beginning and middle go from being sort of fun to being downright offensive.  It's the last twenty or so minutes that save this fifty-six minute feature.  They're absolutely terrific and encapsulate all of the things that Buster Keaton did so well.
The premise for this movie is overly simplistic and rather contrived, but then again, we aren't looking for Machiavellian plots out of most romantic comedies.  Buster Keaton finds himself as the recipient of a large inheritance.  As one could guess, this windfall comes with a catch: if he is married before seven o'clock on his twenty-seventh birthday, he gets the cash.  If he isn't married by that time, then he gets nothing.  (Wouldn't we all love to put weird catches like that into our last will and testament?  I'm planning to withhold everything from my next-of-kin until they put on a clown suit and run down Interstate-270 during rush-hour shouting the lyrics to Eminem's ""Lose Yourself"".)  Since it turns out that today is the unmarried Keaton's twenty-seventh birthday, he races around desperately trying to tie the knot with someone -- anyone.  Naturally, there is one special woman who we all know that he's supposed to end up with, but we have to wait until the very end for the movie to reward us with the anticipated conclusion.
If that plot summary sounds familiar to any reader out there, it's probably because the film was remade recently with Chris O'Donnell in the Buster Keaton role.  I haven't seen that version of the movie, and I can only assume that the decision was made because a movie mogul had some sick desire to see the words ""Chris O'Donnell"" and ""Buster Keaton"" in the same sentence.  This movie is less successful when sticking close to its initial foundation.  Indeed, the Keaton character's unwillingness to marry outside his WASP background is responsible for two of the more uncomfortable moments.  (What is it with this disc and bizarre attitudes towards race?  I know it was a less enlightened time, but I've been making my way through the ""Art of Buster Keaton"" DVD box set and the stuff here really stands out as unusual.  And one of the included short films has its own groan-worthy sequences: would any cop really be so dimwitted as to be confused about Buster Keaton's ethnic background just because of some mud on his face?)
What this film is mostly remembered for is its incredible chase sequence that more or less takes up the entire last third.  Suddenly realizing that there is only One True Woman that he can possible wed, Keaton must escape the clutches of the thousands of would-be brides who want to get their hands on Keaton and his cash.  This leads to sequences of several hundred extras in wedding gowns racing through the city streets, which is almost as funny a visual as the hundreds of angry police-officers chasing Keaton in one of his short films (the aptly named COPS).  But it's Keaton's physical dexterity that makes this memorable.
For example, after escaping the city, he races across countryside.  He comes to a cliff and quickly throws himself off it, reaching out and grabbing a tree to save his fall... a tree that is being chopped down and which slowly topples as soon as Keaton lands on it.  Undeterred, he immediately gets right back up and starts running again.  A few minutes later, he's racing down a rocky hill, inadvertently causing a rockslide.  Watching Keaton sprinting down a sandy incline while dodging large boulders is amazing.  At one point, he comes to a standstill and concentrates solely on avoiding the rocks.  He leaps over some.  Others he ducks under.  He jumps to the left to dodge them.  He jumps to the right.  My first thought on watching this was that Keaton got himself into a live-action version of Donkey Kong, with fake boulders instead of barrels.  I love this sort of Keaton stunt work where I can both admire and laugh at a sequence at the same time.
Also included are two short films.  The first item on offer is NEIGHBORS (1920).  This one reminded me quite a bit of Chaplin's EASY STREET (a long time favorite of mine), at least the parts where Charlie is jumping in and out of windows and doors to avoid the mighty Eric Campbell.  Here, Keaton is attempting to get some alone time with daughter of the house next door, and using a electrical-cable as a zip-line is just one of his inventive stunts.  A hilarious short and one full of great physical comedy.
The other short film is THE BALLOONATIC.  The eponymous balloon serves merely as the McGuffin to deposit Keaton into a surreal camping adventure.  You can't help but love the completely straightforward way Keaton's character always dealt with life.  You see a hot-air balloon?  Start climbing all over it!  You drop out of the sky into a remote forest that's miles from anywhere?  Never mind getting home -- just have a vacation right here and now!  This print is very scratchy, but it's still quite watchable.
Although I was faintly bored by most of the main feature's first forty minutes, this disc is well worth the purchase for everything that comes after that: the incredible and hilarious extended chase sequence and the two inventive short films.",1075939200,4,5309,4.739651416122005
1064239,5,6305701261,"Watching Seven Chances, it's easy to see why Buster Keaton was considered one of the greatest comics of the silent era (although I still prefer Harold Lloyd). The basic premise is that Buster learns that he'll inherit a fortune if he is married by 7 p.m. What follows is a non-stop riot. This has some of the funniest sequences ever filmed, and the final race to the church is so funny that it's almost painful to watch. This is easily one of the top four or five silent comedies, and a great film for introducing people to silent cinema.
Kino's DVD looks great, and features two Keaton shorts, Balloonatics and Neighbors. I highly recommend this.",1062201600,3,647,4.6347826086956525
1064240,4,6305701261,"When it comes to silent comedy, I'm a Harold Lloyd/Our Gang man, but this film has increased my appreciation of Buster keaton.
The man was a comic genius. Although the story is wildly improabable, you wind up caring about what happens to Buster and his finacee.' The mad chase scene, while a bit drawn-out, shows remarkable comic timing and while it may not make you laugh out loud, you have to admire the work that went into this.
The only drawbacks are the elements of the racism of the era. The finacee's handyman is clearly a White actor in blackface (an odd choice, since there are a couple of other actual Black actors in the film). One rather crude scene has Buster approaching a possible ""wife"" on a park bench. He retreats when she opens up a newspaper written in Hebrew. A short while later, he admires a young lady from behind and tries to talk to her, only to ""hit the road"" when she turns to reveal she is Black. But being a film purist, I would not recommend that these offensive scenes be removed from current prints. They should stand to show the mentality of that era.
That aside, it's a great film.",1021075200,3,1116,4.4487804878048784
1064241,5,6305701261,"This DVD is a treasure. I belive it is impossible to find a silent flick presented in a better picture quality than ""Seven Chances"". If you are a collector of early technicolor, then you might be bit disappointed: the ""technicolor opening sequence"" is a mere 3 minute bit (incuding the opening titles). Nevertheless, the movie is great fun, well constructed and acted, the camera works well plus there are a lot of pretty girls and posh clothes if you are interested. The soundtrack is a gem; it's a small movie orchestra (probably an octet) in the main feature, piano and violin in ""Neighbors"" and movie organ in ""Balloonatic"". The other two short features are OK as well, especially ""Neighbors"", which features some really clever (and dangerous) choreography. The picture quality of these two is quite good too. Overall, a wonderful package, although there are no extra features.",1011139200,,881,5.0
1064242,5,6305701261,"Seven Chances is just below Keaton's very best work in The General and Our Hospitality, but is still easily worth its five star rating. All that I will say about the plot of the film is that it is consistently funny with many laugh out loud moments. Moreover, some of Buster's stunts are truly frightening and they do not appear to have been faked. One of the great pleasures of this film is to catch a fleeting glimpse of a very young Jean Arthur. She is the receptionist who turns down Buster's marriage proposal by showing him her ring. Also, for Keaton fans, it is worth noting that the lawyer with the rubber face is the Principal in College. The print on this DVD is very fine. It has an introductory series of episodes in early two-strip technicolor, which is interesting even if the colour is somewhat bleached and damaged round the edges. The main body of the film however is in wonderful sepia. The music has some fine themes and adds to the livliness of the action. It is well played on what sounds like a cinema organ. Of the two short films on this DVD, I will just say that I prefer Neighbors to the Balloonatic. Both are funny, but do not rank with the best Keaton shorts.",981763200,7,1187,4.4
1064243,5,6305701261,"SEVEN CHANCES (1925): Buster is to inherit $7 million on his 27th birthday, providing that he is married before 7:00 p.m. Through a misunderstanding about how worthy she is to him, his girlfriend, at first, turns his marriage proposal down, and this sends Buster on a crusade to hurry and seek a bride in a race against time.
The best scenes in ""Seven Chances"" occur in the last third of the movie, where athletic, speeding Buster is being chased by a thousand angry potential brides, and we get to see the actual houses, shops, cars, gas stations, banks, signs, etc., of 1925 Los Angeles and the Hollywood hills. During the silent era, filmmakers were able to film out of the studio and onto the actual street. With the emergence of sound, outside scenes had to be made using what little acreage the studio had on their back lot, or the use of (phony-looking) rear projection (that sometimes moved way too fast). Another reason the last third of ""Seven Chances"" is so good is because it contains one of Buster's most famous scenes: being chased down a mountain by an avalanche of gigantic boulders.
""Seven Chances"" is a story that was bought by Buster's boss, who expected Bus to mold it to his style of comedy. The script is credited to someone else, but I spotted that Buster probably wrote at least one of the title cards because it contains Keatonese grammar: ""It don't matter who I marry"".
NEIGHBORS (1920): This is a great 2-reeler that starts off as a Romeo and Juliet kind of story, then veers off into Bus getting into silly situations using blackface and being chased by cops, then goes back to the Romeo and Juliet theme. Some of the funniest (and dangerous) gags of his career are shown here between Bus and his father, played by his real father Joe, like Bus being hung by his toes on a clothesline with Joe accidentally whacking him with a carpet beater that throws Bus into a spin-around. ""Neighbors"" continues with the title card ""that afternoon, the inventor tries his patent fly-swatter"". The fly-swatter is just a big board that teeter-totters on the fence that separates the sweethearts' backyards. Weeeeee! ....a disoriented Joe Keaton is flipped into the neighbors' backyard by the fly-swatter, and with this, I noticed that a very funny (and very stiff) dummy was used in the long shot.
THE BALLOONATIC (1923): Buster's first era of his 2-reelers is nearly coming to a close. In a few months, success will demand that he start filming more elaborate features (5-7 reels). This 2nd to last 2-reeler starts off at an amusement park where Buster is trying to pick up girls. He proceeds to a balloon launching where he accidentally is launched with it into the air. After traveling for a while, he is shown idiotically playing hunter (with duck decoys hanging from the balloon) and shoots at a bird that is resting against the side of the balloon. The blast plummets him to the earth, where a series of gags follow with Bus in the wilderness, including the use of lots of animals and a canoe named Minnie-Tee-Hee.",971740800,7,3033,4.7137476459510355

1064245,5,6305701261,"Buster Keaton movies have a similar formula; nave young man gets thrown into a situation where his ultimate manhood is put to test. Most classic Keaton films are written specifically for him, however ""Seven  Chances"" is an exception in this area. Adapted from a 1916 stage play  by Roi Cooper Megrue, ""Seven Chances"" puts Keaton to the task of  finding a bride and getting married by 7:00pm that day, or else lose claim  to a 7 million dollar inheritance. Before the plot, it is known that Keaton  and his stockbroker business partner are very much in debt and the will  face public disgrace and even jail time if they do not find much needed  capital. So not only is Buster wanting the 7 million dollars, he needs it  to keep his freedom.
Without giving away too much of the plot, the rest  of the movie involves his unsuccessful pursuit of an immediate bride. He  can't seem to get a break, when all of a sudden the news of his inheritance  breaks and sends a mob of brides chasing him through the streets &  country. It's the classic ""Buster-Vs-The Elements"" chase that  Keaton is so well known for.
""Seven Chances"" is an excellent  film, although historically it was one of Keaton's least favorites. Keaton  was initially perturbed by his producer, Joe Schneck, purchasing the play  rights and 'Keaton-izing' it, rather than starting from material originated  by Keaton himself. From viewing this film, I am stumped to see any  inferiority and consider the end result to signify a very wise and  entertaining move on Joe Schneck's part. ""Seven Chances"" ranks  with some of Keaton's best work, including ""Streamboat Bill Jr.""  & ""The Navigator"".
The 2 shorts included with this DVD are  ""Neighbors"" and ""The Balloonatic"", both of them  absolutely hilarious. ""Neighbors"" has some of the most inventive  high-action scenes in any of the Keaton films, and ""The  Balloonatic"" has some excellent scenes as well.
 It's hard to go bad  with a Buster Keaton silent movie and ""Seven Chances"" is no  exception. The Kino/David Shepard duo does it again, by preserving a  marvelous copy of this excellent film and by packing and distributing it  with 2 excellent shorts. You and your family will like this DVD.",952214400,25,2201,4.823056300268097
1064246,4,6305701261,"Seven Chances was an old warhorse of a stage play, and at first that fact is a little too obvious.  Stick with it, though, because the climax is pure Keatonian surrealism, and as falldown funny as anything he ever did--  Buster pursued for two reels by two equally terrifying forces of nature, an  army of angry would-be brides and an avalanche of enormous boulders.  Includes one of his more pointed shorts, Neighbors, in which love struggles  to overcome the animosity of two sets of families.

1064421,5,6305701261,"Released in 1925, Seven Chances starts with just over three minutes of very early two-color Technicolor in the opening credits and first four scenes. Jimmie Shannon (Buster Keaton) is trying to work up the courage to tell Mary Jones (Ruth Dwyer) that he loves her. Four successive shots at the same gate in front of her house show the seasons changing through an entire year, but Jimmie still hasn't told Mary that he loves her. The tiny Dalmatian puppy that appears in the opening Summer scene grows progressively through the year, and by the next Spring he is a Great Dane.

Bashful Jimmie is spurred by the news that he has inherited $7 million, but only if he is married by 7 p.m. that very day. Botching a proposal to Mary, he embarks on a day of serial proposals, all rebuffed. His business partner puts a large ad in the newspaper, revealing that Jimmie is heir to a fortune, and asks for prospective brides to appear at the church at 5 p.m. Over a hundred appear, and chase the unsuspecting Jimmie down the street, uphill and down dale in one of the most epic chase scenes in film history. Keaton's penchant for dangerous stunts is on prominent display, as he dangles from a railroad crane, vaults chasms, summersaults down steep hillsides, and is pursued by dozens of rolling boulders up to 7 feet in diameter. Yes, they're props, probably made of chicken wire and papier-mch, but running down a steep hill at risk of being run over by a 7-foot hollow boulder had to be exciting. Meanwhile, Mary has reconsidered her rejection of his proposal, and tries to reach him with a message.

Will Mary reach Jimmie with her acceptance of his proposal? Will they beat the 7 p.m. deadline? Will the business partner have a pocket watch that is set three minutes too fast? Don't try to guess, get Seven Chances and find out for yourself by viewing one of Buster Keaton's most fun and frantic movies.

Extras on the Kino disc include a commentary with the film, a survey of the locations used in the film, a short documentary on the Technicolor scenes, and a gallery of production stills. Also included are two short films with similar or identical storylines: Edison's 1904 production of ""How a French Nobleman Got a Wife Through the New York Herald Personal Columns"", and the 1947 Three Stooges film ""A Brideless Groom"".

(The following is a paragraph of observations about Keaton that I append to all of my reviews of his films, so you might have read it before.) Charlie Chaplin was the graceful mime, Harold Lloyd was the surprisingly athletic everyman, and Buster Keaton was The Great Stone Face. His expression never varied, but his acrobat's body performed the most astounding knockabout comedy and genuinely dangerous stunts in cinema. Other stars had stunt doubles, but Keaton not only performed his own stunts, he sometimes did the stunts for other actors in his films as well. With the advent of sound Keaton's star faded, but has returned to full brilliance since his death, as restored versions of his films have become available for home video. One of Hollywood's true originals and a genius of motion picture inventiveness, Buster Keaton has secured a place of honor in the history of film, and in the hearts of his growing number of fans.",1400371200,2,3252,4.73015873015873
1064422,5,6305701261,"I love Buster Keaton.  This is the first film that I saw of his in which he starred and directed himself.  The beginning shots of him trying to tell his girl that he loves her were awesome, but I don't know if that sequence was actually shot in a prehistoric version of technicolor, or it was tinted by hand.

With that minor gripe aside, I thought that this was a thoroughly entertaining film.  Unlike many Charlie Chaplin films, which tend to be a bit dark, with strong political statements, Keaton's films tend to be more optimistic.  He doesn't always have serious subject matter that he wants to satire.  He just wants to make people laugh by putting himself in one hilarious situation after another.

Seven Chances is about a young man who is told by a lawyer that he has only 24 hours to get married, otherwise, he will lose a huge inheritance.  After bumbling his proposal to his long-time girlfriend, he ends up proposing to every girl he meets. After being spurned by everyone he proposes to, he puts an ad in the paper for a bride, and finds himself being pursued by every female in town.

The highlight of the film is when Keaton being chased down the city streets by 500 potential brides.  The pace is so quick, one can barely catch their breath while the pursued Buster runs through a football game, tumbles down a steep, sandy hill, and creates a massive rock slide which he has to try dodge and outrun.

Although Seven Chances is not as well known as his  other works, this film has made me an instant fan.  There are instances of racial stereotyping that might make modern audiences very uncomfortable, but I refuse to judge a nearly 90 year old film by today's standards.  The world has changed a lot since 1925, and for the better.  I highly doubt that anything was done by Keaton to be deliberately mean spirited or offensive.  No, we don't do this sort of thing anymore, but we did.  History will never be perfect.

So, if you like silent films, and if you like to laugh, I highly recommend this film for your collection.  It is not hard to see why Buster Keaton was one of the great comedic geniuses of the silent film era.",1378512000,2,2145,4.467866323907455
1064423,5,6305701261,"Despite having been adapted from a play -- something that apparently irritated Keaton -- Seven Chances is infused with plenty of Keaton brilliance.

1064426,3,6305701261,"<strong>Seven Chances</strong> (Buster Keaton, 1925)

<em>Seven Chances</em> was Buster Keaton's least favorite of Buster Keaton's films, so much so that, according to IMDB's trivia page for the film, he attmepted to stop Raymond Rohauer from restoring it. While I can't claim to be intimately familiar with Keaton's catalogue--I've seen, at most, a dozen of the silent classics so far--it's my least favorite of those I've seen as well. Which is not to say it isn't good, it's just not AS good as <em>Cops</em> or <em>The Garage</em> or <em>Sherlock Jr.</em> or... you get the idea.

The plot, based on David Belasco's monstrously popular play and adapted by longtime Keaton collaborator Clyde Bruckman, involves one James Shannon (Keaton), who discovers (after a long period of he and his business partner, played by <em>Sally</em>'s T. Roy Barnes) that he stands to inherit seven million bucks. That was a lot of money even in the pre-Depression boom. The catch: he has to get married by 7PM that night. For unaccountably silly reasons, he decides he can't marry the actual love of his life (<em>The Reckless Age</em>'s Ruth Dwyer), so he and his partner embark on a madcap quest to find a woman to marry him.

What gets tiresome is the old, old method of advancing the plot in movies: not talking. Would any of the young ladies in the first half of the movie not married him if he'd just walked up to them and said ""hey, if I put a ring on your finger, you'll be unbearably rich for the rest of your life?"" Of course not (as we are led to believe by the second half, when everyone knows about the inheritance, leading to the classic church scene). The miscommunication between James and His Girl (that's how she's credited) is at least a bit more credible, and leads to what may be the movie's funniest, if a bit uncomfortable these days, moments, as His Girl tries to get word to James that she forgives him through her family's servant, who in going along with the scheme of things is created as The Hired Hand (<em>The Scarlet Letter</em>'s Jules Cowles). Be prepared for some annoying stereotyping, but there's no denying Cowles was a gifted comic actor; his antics make the last bit of church scene work.

Yes, you will spend the entire movie thinking ""this would have made a really funny twenty- or thirty-minute short"", rather than the just-shy-of-hour-long short it actually is. But there's a lot of solid comic talent on the screen, and so even when it lags, there's usually still something going on with which to amuse yourself. ***",1332979200,,2546,4.792710706150341
1064427,5,6305701261,"There aren't many David Belasco ""collaborations"" in revival today, other than those adapted by Puccini. ""Seven Chances"" would be a theatrical stuffed owl if it weren't for Buster Keaton's movie adaptation. Even Keaton struggled with lifting the comedy from its contrived premise, but as soon as he got it off and running, no audience has been able to  stop laughing long enough to catch its breath.

This entry in Kino's ""ultimate edition"" series is one of the best. The movie has been remastered from the Library of Congress print, with extra attention given to the 2-strip Technicolor prelude by Eric Grayson (Grayson also narrates a short documentary about the restoration of this sequence, shedding light on the problematic nature of 2-strip Technicolor). The film is presented in a mellow sepia tint that accentuates the beauty of the source print. Robert Israel's jaunty score is perfectly in tune with the overall '20s air. A second track provides commentary from Ken Gordon and Bruce Lawton.

Also included is another of John Bengtson's visual essays, scouting the movie's locations as they appear today. There's a seemingly endless Edwin S. Porter/Edison short from 1904 that explores territory similar to ""Seven Chances"" (as well as the complications of women in long dresses), and the Three Stooges' short, ""A Brideless Groom,"" for which Keaton collaborator Clyde Bruckman recycled the premise of ""Seven Chances"" to create a somewhat better comedy in the ""Shemp"" era.

1064510,5,6305701261,"In 1925, Buster Keaton created a film adaptation of Roi Cooper Megrue and David Belasc0 play ""Seven Chances"".  His fifth feature film and identified by many of his fans as possibly his best romantic comedy film ever made.

While film critics were a bit split because it was an adaptation which featured several writers responsible for the screenplay, while a simple story that is introduced in the beginning and concluded at the end, it's the middle...the main storyline which features one of the craziest chase scenes ever featured onscreen at the time, and quite timeless even today nearly 90-years later.

While the film would also feature a cameo role by future screwball comedy princess Jean Arthur, the film is also quite notable for its use of a very early Technicolor process at the beginning of the film which was recently restored by Kino for this 2011 Blu-ray release.

VIDEO:

""Seven Chances"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and the film looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray!  But first, let first preface with discussion of the introductory Technicolor scene.

""Seven Chances"" was a film that utilized early Technicolor for the introduction and before this Blu-ray release, the Technicolor portion was in bad shape and degraded to the point that many people who saw the film felt it was color tinting combined with Nitrate damage on the sides.  And then the US Registry has their own version of the intro which is in black and white, so there were people who were unaware of the Technicolor process that was used and thought it was just bad color tinting and Nitrate issues with the original print.

For this 2011 Blu-ray release, according to a special feature included with this Blu-ray release, film historian Eric Grayson talked about how the scene was remade by Kino to keep it as close as what people have watched back in 1925.  With newer technology, they were able to restore the early Technicolor introduction and it literally took 80 hours to fix 3 minutes of footage.  Sure, the Nitrate damage is still there in the introduction but now you can tell it is an early Technicolor process and not bad color tinting.  But it's great to see Kino having redo those scenes, especially utilizing the best source material out there to recreate it.

With that being said, ""Seven Chances"" uses the restoration mastered from 35 mm materials preserved by the Library of Congress.  While there are a few white specks from time-to-time, the clarity of the film is absolutely beautiful and for those who owned Kino's ""The Art of Buster Keaton"" DVD box set and watched ""Seven Chances"", there were many scenes, especially during the outdoor sequences that really never registered to me as a viewer because it looked quite blurry, but with this Blu-ray releae, you can actually make out grass, leaves, water, etc. Especially the contour of objects.  The detail of this Blu-ray release compared to the older Kino DVD release is noticeable and definitely an example to silent film fans of why upgrading to Blu-ray from the older DVD is worth it!

There is a good amount of grain on video but its the detail and clarity that is possibly the highlight of this Blu-ray release.  The contrast is great and black levels are deep and for the most part, the film via HD looks fantastic!

For the release of ""Seven Chances"", Kino has kept to the wonderful score by Robert Israel and we are given the LPCM 2.0 stereo score (which was featured on the original DVD release) but also a brand new DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack.  The score actually sounds wonderful via lossless, absolute clarity and definitely a major difference from the original stereo track that I watched the film on DVD nearly a decade ago.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I can remember the first time I watched ""Seven Chances"" and literally seeing hundreds of women out on the street of Los Angeles as they tried to chase down and catch the character of Jimmy, played by Buster Keaton.

For the most part, Keaton's classic film ""Seven Chances"" can be seen as not deep as his previous films because the premise of the story is rather easy to follow.  Man needs money, many has a chance of inheritance but must get married, so man needs to find a wife to get inheritance before 7:00 p.m.

Keaton's style of making sure the beginning and the end were worked out by the writers, what he needed to complete on his own was the entire middle section of the film.  Where people would gasp at the stunts or whatever he would bring to the big screen.

While D.W. Griffith was a filmmaker who loved using hundreds of extras in his film, Buster Keaton loved utilizing masses.  As he did in ""Go West"" with dozens upon dozens of cattle walking through the streets of Los Angeles, this time around, it's over a hundred women who wanted to marry the character Jimmy.

And like other Keaton films shot around that time, as a filmmaker and actor trying to raise the bar of how much risk he can take in creating the best stunts on film, one stunt featured Keaton dangling from a mechanical fork lift, another featuring the actor jumping from short cliffs to a large tree that falls to the ground after being cut by a logger.

But possible the most visual scene in cinema was Keaton running downhill but this time not being chased by women, but boulders.  Sure, the boulders were specially made but according to Buster Keaton, these boulders were so large that they could hurt someone if they weren't being careful.  According to Robert K. Klepper, ""The Golden Era of Silents 1877-1996', Keaton's body was covered by bruises for weeks because of the filming of this chase sequence.

While film critics were inundated with actors doing these stunts, while Buster Keaton was a marvel in doing his own stuntwork, it was part of the banality of silent films as others like Chaplin, Lloyd, Fairbanks and others were doing physical work onscreen in order to entice their viewers.

And suffice to say, the stunts done by Buster Keaton were risky but how awesome do they look onscreen.  Wonderful, physical comedy, risky and amazing and from the hundreds of women in the chase scene, to those hundreds of boulders falling down hill and heading towards Keaton's character, how thrilling was a scene like that.  And the fact that it does last a long time, it's definitely one of my favorite chase scenes in a film!

And I believe that is why a film like ""Seven Chances"" is so intriguing for us today.  Unlike those filmmakers who were bombarded with action sequences in silent cinema back in the day, for us, many of these scenes are done via stunt men and large crowds are now created in CG.  Watching ""Seven Chances"" was intriguing in the fact that you see so many people utilized in one film but also, to see a part of Los Angeles that while the streets and some buildings are still around, they looking nothing like what we see in this film.

This film is a great time stamp to an era of what once was of early Hollywood or Los Angeles.  ""Seven Chances"" for me, was more than just a comedy film but that captured the look and feel of Los Angeles in 1925 but also the pop culture fashion and hairstyles of women during the 1920's.  And because there were a good number of women featured in this film, it was rather interesting to see those styles come to play.  May it be the dapper teen that was about to get married to Jimmy, to the women with the Louise Brooks hairstyle.  For me, as a silent film fan, I'm drawn into the historic pop culture of that era and ""Seven Chances"" does capture that moment in time quite well.

As for the Blu-ray release, the picture quality of ""Seven Chances"" is fantastic.  Especially if you compared it to the original DVD release, watching the film in HD definitely made a big difference that I feel that for many silent film fans who have not wanted to stray from Blu-ray because they can't see a difference, well...watch this film and compare it to the older Kino DVD and you can see a difference in quality!  As for the lossless audio, Robert Israel's score is magnificent via DTS-HD MA 5.1 but it would have been nice to have another musical score.

But I'm quite appreciative of the special features included with this release.  I would have never expected to see a ""Three Stooges"" short on Blu-ray let alone on this Blu-ray release, but I was pretty happy about that.  Also, for a film that showcases so many locations, I am so grateful that Kino once against featured John Bengston's visual essay.  And of course, you get more features including audio commentary as well.

Overall, ""Seven Chances"" may be a shorter Buster Keaton feature film than others that were previously released on Blu-ray, but it's definitely one of his most delightful romantic comedies that he had partaken in.  Also, for those who love Buster Keaton's risky stunts, ""Seven Chances"" doesn't disappoint in that either because this film required a lot from Buster Keaton in terms of physical comedy. And last, ""Seven Chances"" features one of the coolest chase scenes ever featured in early American cinema.

1064512,5,6305701261,"The biggest improvement of the Blu-ray disc over the old DVD is the 80 hours of work done by Eric Grayson to improve the deteriorating technicolor sequence.  In the old DVD it just looked like a red-tinted film with possibly a hint of another color. Now it is clearly a 2-color sequence.  There is a demonstration in the bonus materials showing you the evolution of this restoration.

The remainder of the film was always very good on the old DVD, now the Blu-ray technology brings out sharper details and a bit more picture around all four sides.  The tinting is different, the old DVD was presented with an AMBER tint through out the film while the Blu-ray has a mild BROWN tone giving it an almost monochrome look.

But with a feature running under an hour Kino needed to add some time with new bonus material.

Bonus Material:
A BRIDELESS GROOM (The Three Stooges) - probably the biggest waste of time including this public domain 16mm film transfer here. It is presented because Clyde Bruckman wrote both the screenplay for SEVEN CHANCES and this 3-Stooges short.  Too bad they could not get access to the 35mm material used for Sony's Three Stooges Collection release.  16mm in Hi-Def?

HOW A FRENCH NOBLEMAN GETS A WIFE FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES PERSONAL COLUMNS - try to say that title fast! A novel short that is fun to see, still a 16mm transfer but not as common.

FILMING LOCATIONS - More great then & now scenes to show you where SEVEN CHANCES WAS SHOT.

ABOUT THE TECHNICOLOR SEQUENCE - a brief documentary about how 1925 Technicolor was shot & what a poor state the footage was in. A 4 way split frame shows you the progression of the restoration work.

Buster Keaton, a businessman who is about to get into some serious trouble and lose all his money, finds out his fortunes might change rapidly as a relative dies and leaves him $7 million. One hitch: he has to be married by his 27th birthday to qualify for the cash....and - surprise - today is his 27th birthday.

Well, he frantically searches for anyone to marry him, starting with his girlfriend and then working down to others. He has a list of seven women - all very pretty, I might add, even with that 1920s overdone silent film makeup. Poor Buster quickly strikes out on all seven of those.

Then - and here is where the real fun starts - his business partner puts a story in that day's newspaper saying his buddy is looking to marry a woman and collect $7 million. All you have to do is meet him at the church at 5 o'clock to marry him. Well, hundreds - maybe a thousand - women all storm the church! When Buster sees this - and then gets a note from his girlfriend saying she WILL marry him - he escapes from the church to meet her. Unfortunately, the chase is on as the multitude of women chase him all over town.

The hordes of women pursue him the main street, through a railroad yard, past the suburbs and finally into the countryside where he loses them. He still isn't home free as giant boulders start chasing him down a hill and then chase him for miles. Keaton keeps running and running through all of it. He has more endurance than an Olympic marathon runner! It's touch-and-go whether he can make it to see his girl by the 7 p.m. deadline and get married.

All of this takes place in a 56-minute film with the last 15 minutes being total insanity with that great chase scene.

1064514,5,6305701261,"""Seven Chances"" (1925) is a fine example of Buster Keaton placing his stylistic imprint on material not specifically tailored for him. In fact, the premise appears ideal for Harold Lloyd: a stockbroker belatedly discovers he will inherit $7 million if he marries by 7 p.m. that evening, yet only has a few hours remaining. What could have been a traditional thrill comedy emerges as a surreal nightmare - featuring one of the great climaxes in movie history, with hundreds of potential brides (and an avalanche of boulders) chasing Buster through the Southern California landscape. The 20-minute sequence is propelled by Keaton's stunning athleticism and a remarkable editing precision. Like many Keaton silents, ""Seven Chances"" seamlessly fuses his deadpan expressiveness with an expert command of the film medium. He transforms a simple farce into a provocative examination of ruthless romance in which deadly boulders are preferable to devouring women.",1209859200,2,955,5.45945945945946
1064515,4,6305701261,"This thoughtfully prepared collection of 3 Buster Keaton movies, 2 shorts from early and late in his pre-feature period, and the feature Seven Chances, show a wide range of comedy styles, from slapstick, to more refined visual humor, to what we would today call situation comedy, where laughs come from unusual or embarrassing encounters.

The earliest in the collection, ""Neighbors"" from 1920 is in some way the most satisfying of the set, although Keaton had not yet here fully developed his mature style of humor. Here there is still a stylistic resemblance to the earlier association with Fatty Arbuckle. The backyard love affair, for example, that opens the film resembles Arbuckle's 1915 classic ""Fatty's Plucky Pup"". In Neighbors there is more story, revolving around the standard theme of feuding parents, and the eventual need for the couple to elope. There is sweetness, youthful energy, and innocence in the entire movie, as well as great acrobatics, including the innovative climactic escape involving two levels of men being carried on the shoulders of other men.

The Balloonatic (1923), near the end of the period in which Buster was making short films, is less rich in comic ideas and lacks the energy and freshness of the earlier film. There is almost no slapstick but rather visual humor involving being trapped in a balloon and trying to survive in the wild and win an unwilling girl. Keaton loves using bodies of water and other objects of nature for comedic props, and this film is full of them. Still, for once Keaton seems uninspired, perhaps making this film to fulfill a contract requirement rather than for love of the story.

The feature in the set, Seven Chances, from 1925, is based on a single theme: Buster, the rich boy down on his luck, must get married by the end of the day in order to inherit 7 million dollars. This absurd premise induces, for much of the film, a Hal Roach-like situation comedy rather than the visual, acrobatic style that is more associated with Keaton, as Buster is cornered into continuously proposing marriage to strangers. The variety of embarrassing rejections that Buster must endure has funny moments, but may not satisfy all of Buster's fans. The climax, however, returns us to tried and true Keaton formula: the lone man being chased by a thundering herd, in this case, of angry women in full wedding apparel, fed up at being duped by a newspaper ad submitted by Buster's colleague unbeknownst to Buster. The chase has satisfying moments, including Buster dodging large bolders. Although worth seeing, the reliance on the single absurd premise makes this film feel more like a dragged out short movie than a genuine feature. The result is a slightly less satisfying encounter with Keaton's genius.",1163462400,2,2762,4.974025974025974
1064516,5,6305701261,"This splendid slapstick farce was  Keaton's revenge to the tensions and bitterness of the marriage life with his first wife, Nathalie Talmadge. The film is a torrent of very calculated sight-gags with a unstoppable rythm that arrives to its ""climactic"" explosion in the spectacular scene in which the character incarnated by Keaton, a wrecked lawyer who have to be married by 7 p.m. of his 27th birthday to inherit a big fortune ( this is, in 24 hours ), must choose between five hundred spiteness brides or a rocks avalanche. The film knew a very poor remake in 1998 called "" The bachelor "". Another masterwork of one of the greatest technician and comic artists of cinema.

1064518,5,6305701261,"My very first introduction to Buster Keaton was seeing a condensed version of this film at the age of about six! So, it has a very special place in my heart, but, it is also a pretty good film too! I place Seven Chances higher than The General and The Navigator personally, however, there is some dislike among Keaton fans of this film, because Keaton is said not to have liked it. Although, this may be true that Keaton didn't care for the film, mainly, apparently, because his producer bought the property and just handed it to him, it is actually a well constructed and funny film.

The film builds, slowly and subtly as he unexpectedly finds himself in need of a wife in order to inherit a well needed fortune. When his only love, turns him down flat he slowly begins to search for another possible wife... anyone! As his desperation builds, so does the film and the comedy. The stuff with all the want-to-be brides is classic! But the pice de rsistance is the amazing chase culminating with hundreds of rolling rocks!

I'm sorry Keaton may not have appreciated that classic comedy film he manufactured, but I'm very glad he did because it is a great comedy film.

Now I want to review the Blu-ray features and the picture quality. The quality of the film used is very good, some of Keaton's shorts, both silent and sound look terrible in high definition because the film used for the transfer were in such bad shape. This one looks great! A pretty amazing restoration of the Technicolor openning was done. I had never known there was a Technicolor openning until seeing this Blu-ray.

Also, included on this disk is a Three Stooges film which has the same basic plot-line as Seven Chances, a look at the color sequence restoration, a look at some of the locations used in the film and a very early Edison comedy that has a very very smilar theme.

All in all this is a pretty excellent special featured movie release!",1119052800,2,1922,4.559420289855073
1064519,5,6305701261,"Frankly, I'd been a bit disappointed in the Buster films I'd seen before this one. Perhaps it was the scrappy condition they'd reached me in. This film, however, turned out to be a treasure and a masterpiece. Finally I became fully aware of how funny and downright amazing Keaton could be. It's strange that other viewers report that he didn't like it himself. Personally, I enjoyed the obviously well-structured plot, the elegant clothes, Buster's incredible athleticism, and as the story came to its ever zanier climax I was laughing out loud, very loud. Aside from the obvious fact that the whole world, not just Hitler's Germany, was unbelievably racist in the 1920s, there seems to be something of a feminist message underlying this story. One of the best scenes is where the vast army of women on the rampage totally flatten two football teams. Yikes, here comes women's lib! I'll grab my hat and run.",1091145600,5,907,4.858064516129033
