740016,5,6303956998,"This is a absolute manipulative movie. Manipulative in the good sense as it keeps you spellbound throughout, and has you wondering whodunit? It also does a very splendid rendition by Dana Andrews as the attorney who honors and respects justice and fair play, and not getting their man/woman. Probably something wasn't thought too much of back in 1947 a prosecuter who ends up defending a man accussed of murder. A forerunning plot that still doesn't see too much of the light of day now.",1119916800,9,487,4.809523809523809
740017,4,6303956998,"Elia Kazan's third directing effort was ""Boomerang!"" - a solid murder drama that explores the sometimes polluting effect that politics exerts on the legal system.  In a small town, a beloved pastor is murdered in the street, shocking the local residents.  Dana Andrews plays the prosecuting lawyer trying the case: clearly the biggest assignment of his career.  A shifty ex-serviceman (the talented Arthur Kennedy) is indicted and appears unquestionably guilty.  But is he?  Everyone involved in the case seems to have an ulterior motive, and Andrews' character is determined to see justice prevail.  The Oscar-nominated story was inspired by a true case; Andrews portrays Homer S. Cummings, who later became U.S. Attorney General in the FRD administration.

Despite being a satisfying crime drama, ""Boomerang!"" is a relatively neglected film, especially among Kazan's outstanding canon.  Why has it been ignored?  All aspects of the film essentially are good to very good, including the acting and direction.  Perhaps the film has been hurt by its matter-of-fact tone and slow-building plot; indeed, the film may a bit uninvolving for some audiences, at least until an undeniably thrilling final court scene.  In addition, the stars (Dana Andrews, Jane Wyatt, Lee J. Cobb) are not marquee names; however, given its true life origins and the semi-documentary style, the movie actually benefits from a lack of star power.  Finally, Kazan's other film that year also overshadowed ""Boomerang!"" - the multiple Oscar winner, ""Gentleman's Agreement.""

Overall, ""Boomerang!"" is an enjoyable foray into 1940s crime dramas that is well worth a look.  Hopefully it will be released soon on DVD, allowing a larger audience to find this film.",1117843200,21,1730,5.359259259259259
740018,4,6303956998,"Dana Andrews had just appeared in the acclaimed Best Days of Our Lives, when Director Elia Kazan lured him to do this film. It is a fine piece of work as Dana Andrews plays a moral man in a political and moral quagmire of an ordinary American town. The documentary style was often repeated, but Kazan got it right first time.
It is a feast of fine acting with the camera moving from one small story to another. There are so many good actors in this film, but Lee J. Cobb delivers the best as the old time police officer.
This film was made just before the HUAC investigation of Hollywood which drove out social criticism of American life. It is an example of where Hollywood was going before the investigation strangled the life from Hollywood. The Best Days of Our Lives was another example of this type of film. It is direct and honest.
The choice of ending where it is not made clear about the killer makes it all the more interesting. I have no idea why this film is not readily available on video. It is a small gem that repays viewing after viewing.",1053820800,22,1055,4.3604060913705585

740106,5,6303956998,"I recently read an article in SMITHSONIAN about a famous lawyer who believes in the innocence of a murder suspect. The sensational story was the basis for the film BOOMERANG!.  Since the article discussed at length the film, I had to see it.

A beloved elderly priest is shot in cold blood on main street in a quiet Connecticut town. The town is in an uproar and justice has to be served. Finally a drifter (Arthur Kennedy) is arrested in Ohio who surely is the murderer or is he? Tests show the gun he has in his possession is the murder weapon, but is it? It seems like a clear case for the prosecution but state attorney Henry Harvey (Dana Andrews) is not so sure the evidence is as it seems.

They don't make movies like BOOMERANG! anymore. Here it's about the writing, the characters and the actors. The joy is watching the story unfold with a town full of dishonest and honest (but maybe confused) locals. The movie has a slow start and a narrator guides us through the film. The murder happens quickly and soon any man in town wearing a black coat and light hat is a suspect since that's what the witnesses saw or think they saw. It's pure storytelling here.

Legend Elia Kazan directed this film that stars screen greats Dana Andrews, Jane Wyatt and Lee J. Cobb. If you're a fan of classic movies, you'll recognize a number of character actors from countless other films of the era. Playwright Arthur Miller is even an uncredited actor in one of the police lineups. There's even a young Karl Malden. What a great cast in a film that harkens back to a different time when men wore suits and hats and came home to their loving wives to start the evening with a drink.

The suspect is badgered into signing a confession and it's up to Harvey to sort through the witnesses and evidence. The courtroom scene is fast paced as Harvey beats down the witnesses and what they may or may not have seen. In a daring and no doubt fictionalized bit of drama, Harvey attempts to prove the defendant's gun could not be the murder weapon.

There is a great deal of high level suspense and drama in the courtroom and that alone makes the film worth watching. Film noir fans will see the genre in the lighting and dark and stark settings. Again, it's about the story and not special effects. BOOMERANG! is for a dedicated movie fan who longs for the good old days of filmmaking.",1485820800,6,2367,4.442396313364055

740143,2,6303956998,"This is not a review of the film which I have enjoyed.  I am a big fan of film noir and I appreciate Kino Lorber for releasing Blu-ray versions of classic film noir.  I have been replacing many of my DVDs with the Blu-ray version.  I recently purchased ""Boomerang"" and ""The House on 92nd Street"" from Kino Lorber.  However, unlike the DVD versions, which have English subtitles and were released as part of a series under Twentieth Century Fox Film Noir (I have all 24 films), these Blu-ray versions are NOT closed-caption or have English subtitles. I wear hearing aids and appreciate having closed-caption to watch and enjoy a film.  Other films in the Fox Film Noir series that have been released so far in Blu-ray by Kino Lorber include ""Daisy Kenyon"", ""I Wake Up Screaming"" and ""Road House"".  I suspect those are not closed-captioned as well, so I will avoid ordering them to replace my DVD versions.  I plan to return these films for a refund.",1480723200,4,948,4.640718562874252

PRECISION: this is the review of ""Fox Film Noir"" Region 1 NTSC USA+Canada version. It will NOT play on Region 2 PAL Europe + UK equipement.

This film is based on a real story which happened 4 February 1924 in Bridgegport, Connecticut. That evening a respected priest, Father Dahme, was shot and killed on the street, without any apparent motive. The investigation which followed was a quite dramatic one, but I will not say here more to avoid SPOILERS and I advise you to not research the whole thing before watching the film. In ""Boomerang"" the events were a little bit amended, but in general lines the film follows the real story.

The film is relatively short (88 minutes) but very well organised and filled with events. It was only the second film Elia Kazan directed, but it is clear that even at that stage he had a great mastery of his trade. All actors did very well but two rise above the crowd - Dana Andrews, who plays Connecticut Attorney General supervising the investigation and Arthur Kennedy, who plays... well, somebody else.

There is a terrible political dilemma in this film. We are told in the beginning that a new administration was recently elected in the state, replacing a corrupt previous government. The terrible murder and the difficult investigation are now being used by the people who lost elections to prepare their comeback to the top of the government - and they are doing a helluva job about it. Which forces the new administration to ask itself a question: ""How many angles can we cut in the name of greater good?""... It will be a difficult debate... I will say no more.

I will keep this review short, to avoid spoilers. I never heard about this film before but I am so glad that I discovered it. Notwithstanding some minor weaknesses of the scenario, it nevertheless IMPRESSED me! A recommended viewing. ENJOY!",1462838400,2,2032,4.777777777777778

Beyond that, I'm not old enough to know so I have to research and read ratings by others on places such as Amazon. I recently ordered 4 more, based on great reviews by customers.

IMO, this film is good but not great, and definitely not a classic in the same league as the above mentioned films. The acting is not as good or convincing and the plot is rather obvious and lacks the usual twists. This is a movie to rent, not necessary to own.

As for the DVD itself, the transfer and sound quality are fine, about the same as others in this series. The DVD contains the film and some other promo trailers. Not much else in terms of bonus features, just like the others in this series.",1456617600,,796,4.264900662251655

It might be interesting to compare Boomerang to the Hitchcock movie ""I Confess"" which starred Montgomery Clift as an innocent priest framed for murder.  Both movies involve courtroom drama, and in both movies the actual murderer is portrayed by the actor O E Hasse.  In addition, characters in both movies take strong moral stands.  It is nice to see Jane Wyatt in Boomerang, portraying the  intelligent and caring  wife of the prosecutor.  Boomerang profits as a movie from many performances, especially the convincing performance of Arthur Kennedy as the accused but innocent.

740301,5,6303956998,"Boomerang  Director: Elia Kazan  1947: 88 mins  Masters of Cinema Series

Dana Andrews is one of the finest actors of his generation (T-Men is a particular unsung favourite of this writer) and he cuts a fine manly and brave figure in this feature brought to us by Eureka! The director, Elia Kazan would later make the more famous films On the Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire and the special features in this fine Masters of Cinema library addition have the great and goodly director walking us (literally) through the thoughts, feelings, life and inspirations surrounding his vision and output. The feature is available in the same purchase as DVD and Blue Ray.

It is described and sold as a noir, but fits better as a stolid crime drama come court room piece. Its notable first cousins would be 12 Angry Men, or Murder Inc, though the story and associated threads have been used in many a police drama from Marked Woman, the early Warner Bros. pre code flick with Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart, to Hill Street Blues and Prime Suspect. The drama of the story is given added weight and gravitas with the use of a voiceover acting as chorus and commentary on the proceedings. The other fantastic feature of the plot is the use of stakeholder perspective, with each viewpoint given a fair once over and the enveloping bias, corruption and relative vested interest in maintaining a perspective acutely felt by the viewer.
'There's one thing you can't beat in politics - and that is a completely honest man' is said at the end of the film but refers to the main protagonist and paragon of virtue State's Attorney Henry L. Harvey, played with gusto by Dana Andrews. A priest with a community presence and goodly reputation is gunned down in broad daylight in front of seven witnesses: the manhunt becomes a moral panic and the stages of hysteria are noted by the voiceover. 'We need a conviction' is the cry of the District Attorney and the wranglings between press/politicians/police are the stuff of Frank Furillo/Fletcher face offs down on the Hill Street Division.

The nearer an election gets - the worse the behaviours as displayed by the local politicians. The priest in question was involved in community decisions about the distribution of land and its purchasing, more dangerous than he himself envisioned, but also a figure sufficiently loved to inspire massive rewards and hysterical vigilante behaviours.
This would include the methods used by the police to extract a confession from a man who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and here the film precedes 'In the Name of the Father' where the Birmingham Six and the recently deceased Gerry Conley were wrongly convicted for a bombing. The finest points are watching Henry Harvey unravel the witness statements to the point of the true perpetrator revealing them-selves at the courtroom grandstanding showdown. One pressman notes: 'it's always the same, if you look around hard enough - you'll always find some guy with his fingers in the till.' It has to be one of the most perfect examples of a court room finale ever made, (better by far than the ludicrous JFK.  Though claiming to be based on a true story, the state of Connecticut never got their man and the freed victim of police bullying was still the suspect to a lot of the citizens vying for blood and justice. Harvey went on to become Attorney General.

Boomerang is not a noir. It is excellent as a courtroom drama centrepiece with this particular DVD set having included a very watchable, (repeated viewings are recommended)special feature of, and starring Kazan who gives generously. It is massively insightful of the time 'method acting' was created and the preferred style of actors in stage and film performances - Elia's politics, life, marriages and works are freely discussed by this talented, deeply thoughtful and integrity ridden man whose works reflected someone who had at heart a fierce sense of responsibility towards the application of fairness and justice. It is of great interest to know that every studio in California turned down 'On the Waterfront' which is probably the most iconoclastic film ever on working class struggle making Brando into a household name.

Boomerang as film and as DVD set as part of the Masters of Cinema series is a good value for money proposition and a must for the serious film buff.

740378,3,6303956998,"Don't get me wrong. Elia Kazan does a bang-up job of direction in this film, which boasts the talents of actors Jane Wyatt, Ed Begley, Karl Maldon -- and especially Dana Andrews, Arthur Kennedy and Lee J. Cobb, who would have stolen the picture had he enjoyed more time on screen. As footnotes, cast member Robert Keith was the father of Brian Keith, and playwright Arthur Miller appears in an uncredited non-speaking part as one member of a police lineup.  The film is told in semi-documentary style, with voice-overs by Reed Hadley. And that, I think, is where the trouble begins. Although many noir films have a documentary frame, I think it has a distancing effect, inhibiting us from completely connecting with the plot. The principal, and I think fatal shortcoming of the movie, however, is the almost complete disconnect between the first two-thirds and the melodramatic, over-the-top courtroom finale. Not even Raymond Burr as Perry Mason resorted to such ridiculous behavior. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself. The plot is based on a real life event in the 1920s: A priest is murdered and a vagrant is arrested for the crime. The populace wants justice, and the local politicos want a quick conviction so as to cinch the upcoming election. State attorney Andrews, however, has some doubts -- which are never made explicit until the final courtroom hearing. Therein lies a problem: I think it would have been much more effective to have made clear these doubts in the course of the investigation. That would have set us up for the finale, as well as better expose points of conflict between Andrews and others, such as police chief Cobb, over the guilt of the suspect. In the interim, pressures are brought to bear on Andrews, some of them striking quite close to home, but he persists in his doubts, leading to a truly ridiculous conclusion where Andrews pulls out all the stops, including the attempted firing of a defective -- and loaded -- pistol at his head. This is yet another of those films where so much is perfect -- the direction, the photography, the casting and the acting -- and yet silly plot elements sink it in a hurry. It's definitely worth watching, even more than once, to savor all those positive elements, but from the standpoint of plot, this is a bit of stinker.",1360195200,6,2301,4.7669172932330826

The use of a narrator is a device that helps to set up and then link the story elements, I don't think it has any more significance, or value, than that. But an argument about category names is not important. Kazan shows us what an accomplished director he was, already this early in his cinema career, with a film that gets your attention and holds it to the end. Kazan does not rely on the film's 'true story' endorsement to give the story interest; he works hard to draw out the dramatic elements of most interest to him. The cast is uniformly good. Kazan apparently gave a great deal of credit to his film editor for the final product. The transfer looks and sounds great. Worth having.",1335744000,6,941,4.382857142857143
740425,4,6303956998,"Most crime noir is NOT a lesson in plebeian civil virtue, good republican police procedure, or wavy grey area moral dilemmas. The best crime noir is where, sure, the bad guys has it coming and by fair means or foul the good guys, cops, privates dicks, or just guys and gals caught in the middle of something, made sure they got it, got in spades, right up to the chair. No quarter given, none taken and we, the audience we, were happy with the result, or at least were not going waste good mother-washed and ironed handkerchiefs over their fate. Or, alternatively, alternatively, best crime noir, that is, occurred when some femme fatale, good or bad, and, we, the male part of the we audience anyway, were not all that choosey which as long as she was fetching, wrapped up a guy so bad he couldn't  think straight, and  led him, maybe led him right up to that aforementioned chair. Gladly, or half gladly anyway.

 In the film under review, Boomerang, neither of these conditions exists yet this is still an interesting crime noir despite its sometimes cloying moral certitudes and raw virtuous civics lesson overhang. Moreover, watching this thing in a post-Miranda (1964) world made this reviewer finally realize what the fuss was all about when the Warren Court brought the wild west boys cop justice under a little control. A little I said, so don't make too much of it. Let's just get to the plot and you can figure out why, okay.

As the film opens a man of the cloth, a padre, gets dead-aim stone-cold killer shot out in
the mean 1940s Middle America Connecticut streets by a someone, some guy. Back then, and maybe today too, this gangster-style or psycho-driven execution rated big 24/7 news and howls of protest, especially since the padre was on the way to neighborhood sainthood. So like any high profile murder case the cops and the DA are pressing, and being pressed, and pressed hard to find this killer who is still walking free to maybe do murder and mayhem again.

And here is where the Miranda part comes in. The cops, the newly anointed town reform civil leaders, the recently thrown-out corrupt city leaders, the newspapers, and the DA's office are all crying for vengeance and a quick solution to the murder (and their PR problems). The cops, the pre-Miranda cops, led by Lee J. Cobb, are more than happy to oblige them when after a massive manhunt they turn up one  drifter, grifter, down at the heels guy, played by Arthur Kennedy, as the fall guy. The frame is on, on big time. Of course, he is the fall guy after a little off-hand by the book, the unwritten book, rough stuff down sans lawyer at the precinct house and some very tricky footwork around the evidence bin, the human witness and murder weapon evidence bin. They have poor Brother Kennedy screaming ""uncle"" before long and he is tailor-made for the big house, and the chair.  Open and shut.

But hold on a minute, a very long minute, the DA, played by Dana Andrews, has second
thought qualms about this railroad job and despite every possible corrupt effort to derail him from the compliant judge, to the cops, to some newspaper guys, to those virtuous civic-minded city fathers, he is after all a truth-seeker. He plods on supported only by wifey, played by Jane Wyatt, who knowing her man, sticks by him through thick and thin. Natch. But, jesus, justice in this case was a close thing, and only came off because our DA boy actually listened up that day they had the ethics class in law school. So you see what I mean about this being an okay film even with no drop-dead bad guys, or drop-dead beautiful femme fatales.

Note behind the camera: Looking at the credits here you will note at least two names that deserve special mention, the director Elia Kazan and the actor Lee J. Cobb. No, not for their well-known cinematic efforts then, or later (films such as On The Waterfront, Viva Zapata, Death Of A Salesman, etc. between them), but for their less that stellar (I am being kind here considering we are dealing with classic ""finks"" and stoolies."") performances before various congressional committees in high 1950s cold war, red scare times ""dropping dimes, (hell, quarters and half dollars)"" on their communist fellows (mostly one-time pinkish fellow-travelers but the effect was the same) in the entertainment industry. Obviously these two guys didn't ""get"" the point in Boomerang after all.  The hell with them.",1327449600,,4411,4.700777202072539
740426,3,6303956998,"Boomerang (20th Century Fox, 1947) was director Elia Kazan's third film.

A popular priest, Father George Lambert (Wyrley Birch), is shot in cold blood in a busy neighborhood of a small Connecticut city. As days go by, pressure mounts on the reform government to find the killer. A suspect, John Waldron (Arthur Kennedy), is eventually arrested and Police Chief Harold ""Robbie"" Robinson (Lee J. Cobb) forces a confession. As straight-as-an-arrow District Attorney, Henry Harvey (Dana Andrews) prepares to prosecute the case he uncovers some disturbing evidence that seems to exonerate Waldron. A corrupt official, Paul Harris (Ed Beagley), fears a drawn out investigation will threaten an underhanded property deal and threatens Harvey to argue for Waldron's guilt. In a theatrical courtroom performance, Harvey proves Waldron wasn't the murderer prompting Harris to commit suicide. Though never brought to justice, the audience learns the killer was a victim of an auto accident and that the honorable DA went on to become the United States Attorney General.

Cobb is outstanding as the tough Police Chief with a heart. Karl Malden appears in his first Kazan film as Detective White. Andrews plays one note throughout the movie and looks most natural with a drink tumbler in his hand. Jane Wyatt portrays Harvey's naive wife. Cara Williams is foxy as Waldron's ex-girlfriend. Sam Levene gives a wonderful performance as a wily reporter. Yes, that's playwright Arthur Miller making a cameo in a police lineup and Kazan's Uncle Joe sits in as one of the jurors. Corruption oozes out of Ed Beagley's pores in his role as Harris.

Kazan revelled in shooting Boomerang on location in the town of Stamford, Connecticut. This docu-drama film noir was loosely based on a true murder case in the neighboring city of Bridgeport. While it's not a great movie, viewers can see the foundations of some of Kazan's later masterworks.

740429,4,6303956998,"Directed by Elia Kazan, BOOMERANG! is another gem from producer Louis De Rochemont; who earlier, gave us THE HOUSE ON 92nd STREET (1945).  As such, it has that docu-drama style that some have called docu-noir.  It was shot on location, in Connecticut and New York: the film fibs a little bit, saying that it was shot in the same locations where this true story originally took place.  The Alain Silver and James Ursini commentary, however, mentions that the Connecticut footage was actually shot in a nearby Connecticut town.

The plot involves the street shooting of a kindly priest, as night fell.  Prosecuting Attorney Henry Harvey (Dana Andrews) is pressured both by the people, who want justice done, and the higher-ups, who are concerned with how they'll look come election time ... if someone isn't found guilty for the crime.  So there is a certain amount of the same mob mentality shown in FURY (1936) and the political chicanery illustrated in THE GLASS KEY (1942); though here, it is played realistically.

It is Dana Andrews' show, and he capitalizes on his opportunity.  He is also surrounded by a super supporting cast:  Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley (in his first big-screen performance), Karl Malden; and even playwright Arthur Miller has a bit-part in a police line-up.

740430,3,6303956998,"Bought this dvd for one reason only: Dana Andrews. To me,
he is one of the most enigmatic of all Hollywood actors out of
the forties and fifties. This is not a very good film, which I
had guessed before getting it, but it's not too bad either, and it does
get rather exciting during its last half hour or so - but then, that
half hour belongs entirely to Dana Andrews.

This kind of part, though, is not the one where he shines at his
very brightest(if one should use such words about a man so dark and brooding) since this is not a film noir at all - no-where in
all the books I have on film moir is it really ever mentioned!

Even so - it is a film starring Dana Andrews, and any fan of his
should have a look - can we ever get enough of him?",1268697600,4,744,3.888157894736842
740431,4,6303956998,"This is a very solid noirish police procedural/courtroom suspense film, with Dana Andrews as young and ambitious State's Attorney Henry Harvey, who is being groomed for governor by the new progressive city government of some nameless Connecticut town.  As the film begins, a popular and well-respected local clergyman is shot in the head at night on a street corner, and the only clues are the caliber of the bullet and weapon that fired it, and the colors of the coat and hat the killer is wearing.  There are several witnesses, but none got a good look at the gunman, and there is nothing in the priest's background to indicate any particular person who might have had a reason to commit the crime.  Under great pressure to find the killer from both political parties (it's an election year) and the outraged populace, Harvey and police chief Robinson (Lee J. Cobb) eventually grab John Waldron (Arthur Kennedy), an unemployed ex-serviceman who has recently left for Ohio.  Waldron has a gun of the same caliber, and there is a fair amount of circumstantial evidence to connect him to the time and place.  But something digs at Harvey, and he has to decide whether finding the truth at the heart of the matter, doing real justice - or doing a politician's work and getting a conviction no matter what - is more important.

What's most interesting about the film is in fact the politics of it; throughout the tense 88 minutes we're never quite sure which of the conflicting motives will triumph - not just in the moral compass of prosecutor Harvey, but also for the police chief, Harvey's wife, the judge - nearly the whole range of characters.  One gets a growing sense that there is a railroading, lynch-mob mentality and at one point about an hour in this literally seems to be ready to boil over.  Unlike the archetypal classic ""wrong man"" film that it might most easily be compared to, Fritz Lang's 1936 FURY, BOOMERANG! doesn't focus very much on the unwashed masses, the mob mentality of those who are out of the loop and might be easily swayed by a half-assed argument if the rhetoric is good enough - instead concentrating on the men (and one woman) of power who have vested interests in putting a man away - or making the other side look bad.  The film generally does a pretty good job of showing the folks in shades of gray, and this helps to keep the suspense real up until the last act.

Where it falls down a little bit is in the character of Harvey; not through any fault in Dana Andrews' fine performance, but in a seeming need to make him very much the ""hero"" of the piece.  Early on Harvey is portrayed as quite ambitious and fairly hard-edged but he softens very quickly and to me his transformation and nobility aren't entirely convincing.  But this is only enough of a problem to keep this from reaching the top echelons; it's still a fine film overall and a key early work in director Kazan's career, dealing as it does with duplicity, false witnesses, and the moral dilemmas which would weigh so heavily on both his later work and his own life.",1261785600,3,3068,4.609174311926606

The suspect's biggest crimes apparently are being in the wrong place, not being a local & dumping the local town [..]. The cops think he did it & arrest him. The media thinks he did it & convicts him in the press. The newly elected city government wants him convicted, guilty or not. The unruly mob of townsfolk outside want him to despense their version of justice. Lots of pressure & Dana'a character at first agrees with them. There are lots of witnesses & then there that confession. He has second thoughts. First there has to be an indictment. As the DA Andrews can ride a conviction to the govenorship. He then proceeds to demolish every bit of evidence he has on the man. This was a real-life case & the man was set free.

  A better Dana Andrews film for Noir fans would be Otto Preminger's ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" in which Dana Andrews plays a violent cop who goes a bit too far and kills a suspect.

A popular minister goes for an after dinner stroll on Main Street on a winter evening. He stops, and a man comes out of an alley and shoots him in the back, then runs away. All we see is his dark coat and light hat, just like the witnesses. The police find many suspects who are brought in but none are identified. Finally they find one man who is identified by the minister's housekeeper. He argued with the minister that day, and has a .32 revolver that is identified as the murder weapon! The police question the suspect for days until he is ready to sign a confession to get some sleep. No third degree methods were used. The case goes to trial.

Can the owner of a newspaper manipulate the news to favor his political party? Can an alienist (psychiatrist) work to convict a suspect? The State's Attorney investigated the crime and the eyewitnesses. Independent ballistic experts said the bullet did not come from the defendant's gun. The eyewitnesses are recalled and their statements are shown to be inconsistent. The recreation of the crime at night revealed the problems. Can a spurned woman concoct testimony to incriminate a former boyfriend and collect a huge reward? The high point of this courtroom drama is when they reveal a flaw in the defendant's weapon! ""Is one man's life worth more than the community?"" Yes, a man's life is real, the ""community"" is an idea.

Interwoven with this story is another man from the community who was threatened by the minister for his behavior. [This could not be specifically mentioned.] He is the same size as the defendant and also owns a .32 revolver. The dark coat and light hat was very common then. Afterwards this man flees when not pursued, a Higher Authority passes judgment. This film is set in modern times (1947) but the background suggests it occurred in the1920s after the Great War. [The right to keep and bear arms was recognized then.]

This dramatic story provides an example for the US Supreme Court ruling that bans questioning suspects without their attorney present. It is a case study of police methods used for solving some crimes. This dramatic film is based on a true story printed in the `Reader's Digest'. Before the reactionary politics of the late 1940s RD had a liberal populist orientation in many of its articles. The State's Attorney was Homer S. Cummings, who later became the longest serving US Attorney General of the 20th century. Cummings was also the Mayor of Stamford where this was filmed. Colt Arms was in Bridgeport. Was the defective revolver made by a competitor? One reason they no longer offer rewards for suspects is to avoid the invention of stories to gain a reward. One example is the use of recreating the crime to check the testimony of eyewitnesses against the facts. Eyewitness testimony without corroboration is just an opinion.
The actual events were not as dramatic as the details in the courtroom. For the facts about this case refer to Francis Russell's ""Tragedy in Dedham"" on pages 249-251.",1169942400,4,3023,4.78544061302682

The citizens are horrified and demand action from the police. All of the witnesses identify John Waldron, a nervous out-of-towner, as the killer. Although Waldron vehemently denies the crime, no one will believe him. District Attorney Henry Harvey is then put on the case and faces political opposition in his attempt to prove Waldron's innocence.",1148256000,2,490,5.215189873417722

Political pressure is put on the states attorney to convict the accused, but he is not convinced the man on trial in guilty. This is a good, true crime/courtroom drama.
