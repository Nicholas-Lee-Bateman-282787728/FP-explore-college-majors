8659560,5,B00KJNXZ6Y,"There may be a problem with the disk format: a Sony Blu-Ray player did not recognize it at all, but a laptop Blu-Ray player from a Sony Vaio played it well although calling it ""Unknown Project"" or something like that. The movie itself I think excellent. Another reviewer called it ""slow"", but I think that was needed to show how Barbastro changed from a place considered safe enough to receive the Claretian missionaries when things seemed to be getting dangerous to the place where all (except two foreigners) were killed. There is almost no violence shown in the movie, though clearly implied. The movie concentrates on the Claretians, with a bit about the bishop and Ceferiano Gimenez Malla ""El Pele"" (the first Gypsy beatified by the Catholic Church).

Besides the 51 Claretians, there was the bishop, 13 cathedral canons, 114 diocesan priests, 5 seminarians, 9 Pian and 18 Benedictine monks killed by anarchist militias in the town. The movie also shows the change in attitude of some of the militia and civilian hecklers who enjoyed seeing priests humiliated, felt increasingly uncomfortable with the executions without trial.",1441238400,2,1132,5.086021505376344
