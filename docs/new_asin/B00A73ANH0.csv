8547642,5,B00A73ANH0,"Bonanza: Official Fifth Season  Vol. 2 has five stories written for Guy William's character of Will Cartwright(Ben's nephew). Guy really shines in The Pressure Game. His appearance in:Return to Honor/The Roper/The Campaneros/The Pressure Game/Triangle are shows that he felt pressured to leave the show by a few of the actors who thought he wasn't needed. My feeling is that Guy would have done well on the show. But as we know, he would have a major role in Lost In Space right after he left Bonanza. Justice after all....Guy Williams thought he was not important to people and look at how these shows are in re-runs that forever stay in our hearts and minds.",1498003200,,660,4.7894736842105265

I have never been a huge fan of Bonanza but I'll watch them. It is a western! The sole purpose I bought this set is because it contains the 5 episodes that star Guy Williams (Walt Disney's Zorro) as Ben's nephew Will Cartwright. I will probably never watch the other episodes in this set but, as all fans of Guy Williams know, its hard to find him acting in television or movies. The man was not used to the best of his many abilities by Hollywood, sadly. I adore him in The Adventures of Zorro, he is THE ONLY Zorro in my book. Williams has such a charm and charisma, he was one of the most dashingly handsome actors as well. He is a delight to watch on screen. I wouldn't trade these 5 precious episodes for anything.
  Guy Williams was actually tested for the part of Adam originally but he chose to turn it down and play Zorro instead. He made the BEST Zorro (Williams is of Italian descent). Then, when Pernell Roberts was going to leave Bonanza, Williams was supposed to join the show's cast as cousin Will. But Michael Landon didn't think another male lead was needed so Will was written out after only 5 episodes. A HUGE mistake I personally think!!! Guy Williams is one of Hollywood's greats!!",1443484800,4,1334,4.41869918699187
