8100984,1,B000CR7R5W,"This is a ridiculous movie, was a very silly story line. Not to mention that it is EXTREMELY POORLY done. If I had to guess, I would think that the total budget for this disaster of a movie is $212. Don't waste your time.",1282608000,2,221,4.045454545454546

8100987,1,B000CR7R5W,"Sorry to say but the previous reviewer was correct. This really is one of the worst films ever made. I can't catalogue everything which is wrong with this but believe me it has no redeeming factors.

A real pity after quite enjoying ""Gang of Roses"", another ""new wave"" urban western. On this one however - save your money.",1185494400,12,322,4.551724137931035
8100988,1,B000CR7R5W,"we rented this out along with Gunslingers Revenge and Brothers in Arms, all ""B"" movies, we stopped watching Ride Sweet Die Slow after  10 minutes, the acting was horrible, the story was undecipherable, and the actual film quality was poor.",1143590400,12,239,4.975
