2550133,5,B000F39P4O,An amazing series that our pastor would recommend to young and old.  This is being used for a couple's premarital counseling as well as a course for married couples.,1354492800,,165,4.689655172413793
2550134,5,B000F39P4O,Received the video on time and in great shape. Is much more convenient than the tape set we had of this product in the past. Looking forward to sharing this with many others.,1329004800,2,174,4.303030303030303
2550135,5,B000F39P4O,"We have used this video series for pre-marriage counseling and are currently using it with a group of 15 married couples.  It is very practical, very Biblical and effectively delivered with just the right amount of humor.  It is easy to follow and creates good discussion.  I highly recommend it.",1296691200,,296,4.88
2550136,5,B000F39P4O,We are just half way through this series but I can tell you it's great.  it's for married as well as young couples thinking about marriage.  I recommend this to anyone want to be in a God designed marriage.,1294444800,2,206,4.256410256410256
2550137,5,B000F39P4O,Jimmy Evans speaks to husbands and wives from his personal life and marriage to his wife Karen. He is direct in his approach to both men and women. He speaks from the heart to issues that are sensitive & challenging  to work through as a married couple. He provides insights and hope to the most difficult scenarios with a touch of humor at appropriate moments. I highly recommend this DVD series to all couples who are seeking to improve their relationship and strengthen their marriage based on the foundation of Jesus Christ.,1246320000,2,528,4.739130434782608
2550138,5,B000F39P4O,"Our church presented this DVD series to us some years ago in an all day seminar.  I was going thru a pending separation and divorce at the time, but I went anyway...to find out how a marriage REALLY should be and to prepare myself for the future.  I said to myself that whenever I was ready to marry again, my future mate and I would HAVE to go thru this first, before we moved forward.  Thus, I purchased this set and we are watching it slowly, pausing to discuss issues, etc.  It is an outstanding series for the married, soon-to-be married, want to be married...you get the point.  I would highly recommend for ALL.  It is sound biblical and practical instructions for a victorious marriage.  If your church does not present this to you, buy it yourself.  It is more than worth the nominal expense.  You will already have 90% of your marriage counseling complete (smile), if you do it right and discuss the issues.  That way, when you go into your actual, live sessions with your pastor or whomever, things will flow smoothly and quickly because you have already tackled the major issues.",1228089600,11,1091,4.577319587628866
2550139,5,B000F39P4O,"My husband and I really enjoyed the fresh perspective in this study.  The speaker in the video was so knowledgeable in scripture and at the same time was very open about his own struggles and shortcomings in the past.  My favorite part was that it wasn't just a 1,2,3 now everything is fixed study, it relied heavily on the conviction of the Holy Spirit and personal spiritual formation.  Now that is really where lives are truly affected is through God's transformation of the heart, not a formula.",1216512000,2,499,4.712643678160919
2550140,5,B000F39P4O,"After reading Jimmy Evans book, Marriage on the Rock, and buying the CD, my wife and I decided to buy the DVD http://www.amazon.com/Marriage-Rock-Jimmy-Evans/dp/B000F39P4O/ref=pd_bbs_sr_5?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1213235904&sr=8-5
Being married for 46 years, we often meet with couples to mentor them in their marriage.  This resource is the best we've ever seen.  We showed it to two couples groups, and both groups ordered the DVD.  The material is insightful, Biblically based, and presented in an honest way - and with appropriate humor.  The discussions that have followed have been deep and beneficial.",1213142400,11,601,5.873563218390805
2550141,5,B000F39P4O,"I bought the book marriage on the Rock 6 years ago and it left a lasting impression. Now that I purchased the DVD which is worth the $ 100.00,I can't wait to show it to all of my friends.
It has all the informations that is needed to a happy marriage.
We spend a lot of money for schools to make more money, but can't see that marriage also requires education but we don't want to invest.
This marriage seminar is a gift from the heart of God to us and I thank the Evans to allow God to share with us the success for a happy secure marriage.
Sincerely,
Evelyn Shaw",1207785600,4,564,4.044642857142857
2550142,4,B000F39P4O,"The best resource on marriage I've seen. Extremely beneficial whether your marriage is on the rocks or you have a great marriage which you want to make even better. Some really insightful stuff there. I don't usually buy this sort of stuff but this time thought it would be a great investment. It is a Christian DVD however it in no way precludes or is offensive to non-Christians, in fact I think there are some unique perspectives which make it all the more richer. Highly recommend it (and I've never recommended something on amazon in my life)",1191542400,23,547,4.649484536082475

I wish this had been available years and years ago!  Just remember to listen for yourself and not jab your spouse (bf/gf) in the ribs with your elbow to make sure they're listening.

2550168,1,B000F39P4O,"From the beginning, this felt like it was another male dominance fantasy. Every time I read the author refer to himself as ""I (Jimmy)"", I wanted toss the book... not because it was annoying itself, but for all the lack of ""I (Karen)"". I went along with it because my fiancee and I decided to read it together. I told her my concerns but we gave it a few more chapters. She eventually read ahead of me to this quote,

""... a woman should meet her husband's visual and physical needs. A wife needs to reveal her body to her husband to allow full, satisfying body contact as a part of sex. -- Because men typically have a stronger need for sex than women, sex is not just a preference or a pleasant event. It is a major need in his life.""

Not only did I resent the attempt to subjugate my bride, I felt reduced myself... as if as a man I am incapable of complex desires or of basic human respect for the woman I love. It was clear at that point, this book is not based in the heart of a God who blessed marriage but had a life in abundance without sex. Sex is not just some male need, it is an intimate desire that can be granted with grace by both partners. Doing the dishes doesn't earn any man the right to have sex with anyone. And why are we still ok with telling women having strong sexual desires is abnormal?? From what I've experienced, this just leads to women ashamed of themselves if they happen to fall for a guy with a lower libido.

After that, he(Jimmy) went into a weird monologue about women ""scarred"" by sexual abuse that I skimmed out of morbid curiosity.",1431043200,,1573,4.219269102990033

DVD selection was purchased in April 2014.  I was attempting to use the material as a premarital  study and had no idea the DVD's were the same.  I will use caution in the future before purchasing items from Amazon.  The ruturn policy for defective items should be easier and more flexible. I paid $100.00 for incorrect packaging and now there is no recourse. I have searched for a contact number for amazon or an email address to no avail.
I contacted Marriage Today and their response was that since I did not purchase the DVD set through their ministry they could not help me.  I did learn that Marriage Today has a return policy of 6 months rather than 30 days.  It seems that Amazon could honor the producers policy.

The ten sessions are a little over an hour in length and deal with a wide range of issues for first-time married, currently married, those getting married, or couples with blended families.
