8289222,5,B001CTWZHY,Really good informational and spiritual documentary.  Fell a little short not pointing out who it was that demanded Pontius Pilate crucify Jesus but the man probably didn't want to be labeled an anti-Semite.,1476576000,,207,5.2727272727272725

NOT a worship around facing cancer!!!  We all have faced cancer in our lives. We will face it again.

But the Lord's Prayer predates man's recognition of cancer. It is the prayer our blessed Saviour taught us to pray!!!
When one gets backed into a wall with nowhere to go we look Upward. Our Lord opens our hearts. We pray
for His help and He saves us. There is ALWAYS hope! When Peter lost his faith and began sinking in the
Sea of Galilee didn't he say""Lord, save me.""? (Matthew 14:30)  Impossible situation +
we cry out to the Lord. =We are saved.

And, DON'T get the idea this is a dry sermon. It is a loving reflection by a wonderful man. A fresh, conversational
perspective. Each of the 8 minute segments is shot in the Holy lands. Ken uses anecdotes to illuminate his talks.

=How many say it day after day/week after week giving no thought to it's meaning? Ken provides some meaning.",1425513600,,946,4.382857142857143
