1178450,2,B000003KHQ,"The same actor playing a number of parts works on the stage, because the audience can congratulate themselves at the interval by appreciating all the so called versatility of the performer.

1178451,3,B000003KHQ,I like Matthau and the vignettes were well done but the problem was with the overwhelming cynicism of the stories. This can have a role but I just wasn't prepared for it.,1425081600,,170,4.34375

1178479,3,B000003KHQ,"Maybe  I just found out that I am not a big fan of Neil Simon's play. May be that the movie is a bit dated. Or perhaps I did not find a lot of humor or meaning in the situations Walter Matthau found himself in. Or maybe it was just that Walter did not seem to  sympathize with those characters he played. Usually I like Walter in his various roles. But this time, I did not find him to be inside of the folks he played nor the ones who were supporting him in the play/ movie. His performance did not draw me inside the screen. I do not know for sure why I did not get the usual enjoyment from this particular film.

Though I wanted very much to like this play and derive some fun and meaning from the use of my time, I only found the movie watchable; but not satisfying enough to really recommend.",1414886400,,797,4.031645569620253
1178480,5,B000003KHQ,"I enjoy almost all of Walter Matthau's movies.  I'm a fan of older movies that actually have a story and don't need to be the ""current"" topic of the media or filled with explicit sex scenes and violence added to keep the audience captured because the movie is so bad.  I love Walter Matthaus's dry sense of humor.",1414368000,,313,4.379310344827586

1178531,4,B000003KHQ,"This movie was a classic of its day, and it held up well with time.  The acting was superb, the plot was funny and touching at the same time.

For anyone who enjoys a good comedy and watching classic actors of yesterday on the big screen, I highly recommend this movie.",1400544000,,269,4.254901960784314
1178532,4,B000003KHQ,The last time we saw this movie was in 1970 in the theatre. What a great find to locate it here on Amazon Prime. This is a good adaptation of the play of the same name. The player are all classic purveyors of their craft who deliver this classic very well. If you're a fan of Neil Simon and Walter Matthau this is a movie you must add to your collection.,1400544000,,354,4.0
1178533,4,B000003KHQ,"What could be better to watch? If you like Walter Matthau and enjoy Neil Simon, here is another great movie to watch especially on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Just the right amount of laughter. Certainly not slap stick, but real life situations shown in vignettes revolving around a suite of rooms at the Plaza Hotel.  Walter Matthau plays the lead in each vignette.  Each character different, but all pure Matthau. Neil Simon takes a look at a funnier side of infidelity. You wouldn't think there was a funny side to it, but Simon seems to find it. The last vignette is the funniest. Daughter as bride to be locked in the bathroom of the suite, refusing to come out for the wedding, Walter Matthau playing the father absolutely beside himself. Just too funny. If you've never seen it, it's is worth a look. If you've seen it before, it's worth another look.",1400025600,,856,4.625
1178544,3,B000003KHQ,Not that great...I thought they were rather tasteless and boring.  All of the characters were better at acting than what was seen here.,1399593600,,135,4.869565217391305
1178545,3,B000003KHQ,"This movie is very well done and the woman in the first scene is tremendous (as is Walter Mathau, as always).  However, I found the shaking up of this pair after all those years of marriage a little traumatic to witness, so I switched the movie off.  Turned it on again a few days later to watch the last fifteen minutes.  It was hilarious!",1398729600,,340,4.28125
1178546,2,B000003KHQ,"It's odd to have all three men played by Walter Mattheau but the women played by three different actresses, though the acting is competent in all cases. I guess this movie would appeal mostly to Walter Mattheau fans.",1398470400,,216,4.7105263157894735
1178547,4,B000003KHQ,"Yes, it was OK;  Walter Matthau is always entertaining to watch, but, although I watched the whole movie, I have mixed feelings about the subject matters.  Jean Stapleton made the first act my favorite one with her superb acting.  She lived her roles in a way few actors do anymore by truly becoming the characters she played; here she IS the slighted wife and you can feel her confusion, her desperation, her hesitation to stand up for herself, then going back on her own words when she does.  First act definitely the best of these three acts; second and third OK, although, in the second one, the married woman who is so easily manipulated by the now famous old boyfriend, is an interesting study in how some people throw away or destroy their lives when they hear the things they want to hear.  The woman's gullibility is masterfully depicted in the manner Matthau's character makes her do exactly what he wants her to; of course, he is only after sex for the night.  We are led to believe he gets it, and then drops his old girlfriend since she so obviously means nothing to him.  Blinded by his manipulation, she does not catch on because of how much he means to her; she has kept up on all kinds of details of his now famous life, creating a dream about being with him which has helped her endure her own bad life and marriage.  The third act is silly, but funny; it is a typical Matthau act, although he also had the ability to play more serious parts, like in the first act.  Actually, all three acts show how superb an actor he was.",1398384000,,1542,4.401408450704225
1178548,1,B000003KHQ,"Watching this is a miserable experience. Suffered through the second one also. Kept expecting something better.  Did not stay for the third one, although one person rated it worth the time.  Not for me or my wife",1397865600,,212,4.702702702702703

1178552,3,B000003KHQ,"The scenery was wonderful.  Seeing the Plaza Hotel in its heyday was great.  I was confused as to the ""story line.""  However, the dialogue was fascinating.  I'm just not a really big Walter Watthau fan.  Also, it was based on a play, and sometimes plays do not translate to film with the same result as they produced in live theater.",1395014400,,333,4.483333333333333

1178586,5,B000003KHQ,"The beyond talented Neil Simon presents a lesser but still worthy effort with his six-degree separation tale(with the Plaza being the link) comprised of three vignettes all starring Walter Matthau.  A fun, insightful way to spend an afternoon!  An interesting note:  ""The Out- of- Towners"" was supposed to be one of the original vignettes; however, it was ultimately decided the piece would resonate better as a stand-alone piece.",1390176000,,430,5.294117647058823

1178590,2,B000003KHQ,"I didn't think I could find a Walter Matthau movie so completely UN-entertaining.  I'm a huge fan and have enjoyed so many of his movies over the years. (""Hopscotch"" is probably my favorite.)

""Plaza Suite"" is slow moving and not all that funny. Other than its style, it's hard to believe it's a Neil Simon play. The first two acts aren't even amusing; the gifted Maureen Stapleton saved the first act, but what a sad story. The third part with Lee Grant has some very funny moments, enough that I would have rated it a 3.5; but overall this movie is a big disappointment.

Of course, what we each find humorous is different and individual, but regretfully I can't recommend this one.",1379635200,,684,4.590163934426229

1178690,4,B000003KHQ,"If you want a mildly entertaining snapshot of what made Walter Matthau such a skilled curmudgeon of an actor, you should take a look at this 1971 three-act Neil Simon comedy directed in a fairly pedestrian manner by Arthur Hiller. Based on Simon's Broadway hit, it feels very stagy with reams of dialogue and for the most part, a recreation of Suite 719 at the Plaza Hotel as the movie's only set.  There is a central conceit in casting Matthau as the male lead in all three mini-plays, but fortunately the three characters suitably fit the contours of his talent. It also helps that Hiller cast three superb, relatively unsung actresses opposite him.

In the first and most dramatic piece, Matthau plays Sam Nash, a preoccupied, workaholic husband who sees his youth slipping away as he celebrates his 23rd (or 24th) wedding anniversary at the Plaza. Played by the wonderfully earthy Maureen Stapleton, his somewhat absent-minded wife Karen comes to realize that Sam is having an affair. Stapleton is really center stage here and performs superbly as she gradually realizes her anniversary celebration is unraveling into a much-too-delayed discussion of the true state of their marriage. The second mini-play is a light farce with Matthau playing self-absorbed Hollywood producer Jesse Kiplinger. Sporting an unflattering 1970's blonde wig and affecting a saucy, faux-hip accent, he is hilariously on the make for his former hometown flame, Muriel Tate, now a New Jersey housewife. The underappreciated Barbara Harris has an appropriate showcase for her spacey, improvisational flair as Muriel, especially as she asks about her favorite movie stars at the most inopportune times during his less-than-subtle seduction.

Probably because of its frenetic pace, broad characterizations and physical comedy, the last act is the funniest of the three with Matthau and Lee Grant playing Roy and Norma Hubley, who are desperately trying to talk their hesitant daughter out of a locked bathroom just minutes before her wedding. Their rat-a-tat chemistry is priceless as they encounter every possible mishap with Grant especially hilarious as Norma in simmering panic with her palpitations and torn stockings. As a whole, there is no getting away from the fact that the movie feels like a filmed stage play, but Simon's dialogue is crisp and insightful and the actors so expert that it is worth viewing. Sadly there are no extras with the 2003 DVD.",1148428800,,2439,5.169620253164557
1178691,4,B000003KHQ,"Plaza Suite was the first of three ""Suite"" plays by Neil Simon.  The premise is that the entire play takes place in on suite of a hotel.  In this it was Suite 719 of NYC's Plaza Hotel.  Each of the three acts has two main characters.  On stage, the same two actors played all three acts.  In the film, Walter Matthau plays the male lead but three different women play opposite him, Maureen Stapleton, Barbara Harris and Lee Grant.

Visitors From New York -

It is the Nash's 24th Wedding Anniversary.  Karen (Stapleton) wants everything to be perfect.  She has reserved the same room as on their wedding night.  The only problem is her husband Sam doesn't care.  And he's having an affair with his secretary.

Maureen Stapleton has always been a great character actress.  She would perfect the harried wife to perfection  Her natural warmth and charm always makes her likeable to the audience.

Visitor From Hollywood -

Jesse Kiplinger is a Hollywood producer who is in New York for the opening of his new film.  He has a couple of hours to fill and he is looking up an old flame from high school, Muriel (Harris).  Muriel is happily married but she is star struck.  All she wants to do is say that she was with a famous Hollywood producer, not that she slept with him just spent the afternoon. (Remember this was the 60's).  Jesse tries but Muriel resists until he talks about the stars.

Barbara Harris has perfect comic timing, even when she does dramatic roles.  She also is not afraid of physical comedy.  In this she combines both perfectly and works off of Matthau with ease.

Visitors From Brooklyn -

Roy and Norma (Grant) Hubley's daughter is getting married today.  That is if they can get her out of bathroom.  This is pure Simon farce.

Lee Grant has proven she can do anything but all out farce is her forte.  No one does a woman on the verge better.

Walter Matthau was a high profile character actor.  That is until he and Jack Lemmon met up with Neil Simon.  The Odd Couple permanently moved Walter to leading actor status.  Therefore, when the next Simon project was ready for filming, that Matthau was the first choice.  Walter had three very different characters to play here and he does each to perfection.

This is master class in comedy, not only acting but directing and writing.

1178692,4,B000003KHQ,"Walter Matthau has a field day playing three roles in this trio of one-act plays that all take place in Suite 719 of the Plaza Hotel.  In the first story, he plays a bored businessman with a mid-life crisis and a desperate wife (Maureen Stapleton.  Witty dialogue with a serious tone.  In the second act, Matthau plays a self-centered movie producer who calls his star-struck old flame (Barbara Harris) in hopes of some afternoon delight.  Silly and funny commentary on the power of celebrity.  In the last story, Matthau is the father of a bride who is currently locked in the bathroom, refusing to come out.  Snappy sarcasm played for big laughs.

Adapted from the Broadway smash by Neil Simon, the movie looks and sounds like a staged play.  The actors all shout like they're reaching for the balcony and there's never a moment's pause between lines.  The actors even come out for a curtain call at the end. It's dated, but made thoroughly enjoyable by the stars, especially Matthau, who looks like he's having a great time.  A funny movie.",1130284800,,1043,4.712707182320442
1178723,3,B000003KHQ,"While Walter Matthau and his talented co-stars do an admirable job, the first two vignettes have little to offer. Even 35 years ago, I think the stories of adultery and seduction were unoriginal. The last story, however, is a non-stop laugh session. I mean, face it, Walter Matthau's best moments are those when he's at the boiling point. And in this case, with his daughter locked in the Plaza's bathroom on the day of her wedding, the penny-pinching Matthau erupts over and again. Lee Grant, as his hysterical wife, is a perfect companion. This episode is well worth suffering through the first two.",1126051200,,601,4.844660194174757
1178724,2,B000003KHQ,"I am a big fan of Neil Simon (also Woody Allen and Mel Brooks).  But I didn't like this movie when it came out, and I didn't like it yesterday.  Walter Matthau is not so protean as these reviews would have it.  He can be very funny, but he needs a good script to do it.  The women shone.  The first story was brutally painful.  The whole skit and all but 2 or 3 jokes belonged to Maureen Stapleton.  The second sketch was simply nothing.  Two things made me laugh (I was supposed to laugh, wasn't I?).  When Matthau to freshen Barbara Harris' vodka stinger pours straight vodka right out of the bottle into her glass, and when she asks him (he's a movie producer) whether Frank Sinatra is as generous as people say he is, and he answers that at one of his dinners Sinatra served large portions.  The third story had a lot of good guffaws in it, but it alas was a one joke show, and after the snappy ending, I was left feeling let down.  Finally, I thought the curtain calls at the end of the flick were pretentious, the movie wasn't that good.",1077321600,,1043,4.217171717171717
1178725,3,B000003KHQ,"What happens when you combine Neil Simon and Walter Matthau? You get this hilarious remake from a Neil Simon play! Matthau is just absolutely amazing  to watch, going from one character to another! He proves his status as an  ""A"" list actor. The story concerns Matthau playing three roles.  Each just happens to be staying at the same room in the same hotel, at of  course, separate times. And offers three different and unique stories for  each situation. Of the three skits, I prefer the third sketch. Sure, many  say the first one is better, but it's more sentimental then the three,  which is exactly what it's suppose to be. But the reason I chose the third  one is because, it's simply the funniest of the three. And when I watch a  Neil Simon film, I expect pleny of laughs. And the third one offers them.  Wonderful performances by all the supporting women. Many think Mauren  Stapleton was the best off all three, she was in the ""first act"",  playing Matthau's wife, who learns something terrible about her husband.  And no, I'm not going to tell you. Barbara Harris is quite good in her  performances as Murie Tate, Matthau's ex-wife, whom he calls over to his  hotel room for some ""fun"", is you know what I mean. And last but  not least, we have Lee Grant and Matthau play Mr. and Mrs. Hubley, who are  having a hell of a time trying to get their daughter, who is having second  doubts about the marriage, out of their hotel bathroom, so she can make her  wedding! Unbelieveable chaos insues, and is a pure delight to watch.  Unfortunatley Matthau wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor,  what proves, that the Academy always makes some sort of mistake. Plus, the  screenplay written by Simon wasn't up for Best Adapted Screenplay. One of  Simon's best! If you enjoy this movie other Matthau & Simon films are:  ""The Odd Couple 1& 2"", and ""California Suite"".",969321600,,1880,4.593373493975903
1178726,5,B000003KHQ,"I think Walter Matthau is the absolute greatest comic actor of all  times,and Neil Simons the playwriter just suited for him. The first piece is  comparable to Pinter's plays. I admit I've hated seeing good Walter play so  despicable a charachter,so phoney,devious,unfeeling,arid and shallow. But he  plays it so well that I forgive him,and Neil Simon .The second picece made  me admire the way the extenuated ,cunning actor plays her way into the  heart of his old friend. The third piece is pure laughter,yet one cannot but  think that the delusions of marriage shown in the former pieces are an  anticipation and premonition of the fears of the third couple's daughter.  What if she and his  laconic husband end up as the first couple?Will they  ever prevent it..?This movie makes you laugh first,then makes you wonder!",965779200,,822,4.970588235294118

7902718,5,B000003KHQ,"There are 3 separate stories, each taking place in the Plaza Hotel, however, I, like most people, only liked the 3rd story. The 3rd story is absolutely hysterical. One of the most funniest movies EVER, as far as I am concerned.
Walter Matthau and Lee Grant are amazing in this movie, playing the mother and father of a girl who has locked herself in the bathroom, right before she is supposed to walk down the aisle. If you can watch the 3rd story with Walter Matthau and Lee Grant, without laughing, you need to check your pulse, because you may very well be dead.
From Wikipedia: ""The segment is filled with increasingly outrageous slapstick moments depicting her parents' frantic attempts to cajole her into attending her wedding while the gathered guests await the trio's arrival downstairs.""",1521936000,,796,4.860294117647059

7902722,4,B000003KHQ,"Forty six years ago, Neil Simon's stage play was made into a three-vignette movie.  They all take place in the exact same suite of the old and famous NYC hotel, the Plaza Suite.

First with Jean Stapleton (later Archie bunker's wife) plays a wife of 49 greatly excited to be celebrating her 24th wedding anniversary in the same suite as her honeymoon trip.  She arrives first and her cynical worn-out husband (Walter Matthau) arrives from the office, shoulders drooped  and no energy, taciturn and dreary.  Thus begins slowly an argument over the state of their dull marriage.  His affair with the office secretary Ms. McCormack becomes clear.  Off he goes after a call from her that he is needed to work with her all night to correct figures on an important contract.  The two actors are professional but the sadness of their run down marriage is a really a downer.  Comedy?  No.  Her husband admits that he himself cannot understand why at 51 he is doing it after a successful marriage and family life, Great business success and a big house, all he had dreamt of when in the WWII Navy.  Playwright leaves us to decide what is wrong and why he will leave his wife and what she will do.  It is 1971 when divorces were becoming rampant in the middle class.

The second is even less funny.  Matthau plays an aging and cynical Hollywood producer whose destroyed three marriages and now calls up old lovers from a little black book when he gets to the NYC hotel suite.  One agrees after fifteen years'  abscence to come in from her married with kids in the suburbs life to meet him.  Extremely nervous and afraid To be caught, she arrives in a trench coat, the former Muriel Tate.  Well acted by both, his unctuous manner and her hesitation soothed by alcohol are meant to be funny.  But it is sad to see that both characters are unhappy with their lives and are looking in vain through a quick affair to find some kind of jazz or even longer happiness.  It clearly won't work.  The hippie reddish long hair on tall and skinny Matthau is jarring and perhaps the funniest thing about the scene.  tate's desire to meet actor Lee Marvin, who might drop by (Matthau's lie to lure her in), made me laugh.  She didn't care about the old lover, just a chance to meet a star!  Sad for all.

Finally somewhat funny is the third vignette.  Big Jewish wedding with Matthau as father of a 21-year-old ""college graduate"" brings on all the stereotypes and expectations of parents and young couples.  She is scared stiff and locks herself in the bathroom while hundreds of guests and expensive wine and musicians and ballroom booking and engraved napkins wait downstairs, when even the minister is saying he might have to leave for another wedding job. He screams and yells and shouts With endless pacing about all these nonstop high expenses.  So it is the last straw that she does not want to marry after all.  And the embarrassment !!!

Soon great extreme measures are taken.  He is out in his tuxedo on the hotel ledge to get into that bathroom through the window.  He gets drenched from a sudden rainstorm.  His wife pulls his tuxedo in two trying to stop his fall.  She runs her stockings. They break a chair trying to break the door down.  Daughter won't answer at all.  They plead and threaten.  Nothing works.  There really is comedy in seeing the parents' desperation.  Finally they call the groom up and tell him. He bangs on that door and shouts, ""cool it!""  Out she comes in white dream dress.

Yes I am giving the plot away but it is in the witty writing of the third vignette that one can see some cleverness and more positive insight into our middle class human race.  It is also cynical in showing that no Matter all that these families and couples and former lovers strive for, it is never enough and they are unhappy and dissatisfied.

All in all they are well done and portray 1971 life and fashions in NYC. But many viewers may find themselves depressed by all three.

Should some bad misfortune such as a death or disease wake these people up?  Seems so.",1484611200,,4058,4.542817679558011
