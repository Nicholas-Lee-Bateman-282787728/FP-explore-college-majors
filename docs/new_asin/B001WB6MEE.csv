8347364,1,B001WB6MEE,Waste of my time and money. I fast forward through most of it because it was so bad. It wasn't very gory and the acting was horrible. Don't waste your money on this one!,1391817600,,169,4.0
8347365,2,B001WB6MEE,"a strange plot, weird camera work, a little girl on girl for ya, overall it just made my head hurt,",1382486400,,99,4.0
8347366,2,B001WB6MEE,It sounds like horror fun but it is just a sleepy mess. Bad actors silly storyline. It really is like a high school film project someone did. And got a B. That's good for high school but theater wise that's a C!,1360281600,2,211,4.0476190476190474
8347367,1,B001WB6MEE,"This straight to video stinker is as close to worthless as possible. It stars a cast of virtual unknowns. This film deals with a host of foul subject: severe drug abuse, prostution, hate-sex, murder and the list goes on. The budget was so low it appears to have been filmed at someones home or possible a double wide trailer. The plot is so foul and degrading I don't see the need to mention it. Please done waste your money on this low budget stinker.",1355961600,,452,4.392857142857143
8347368,2,B001WB6MEE,"After reading the customer reviews on Tied Up, I thought I would give the movie a chance. Big mistake on my part. I found the movie to be something young 19 or 20 yearolds would film themselves for laughs, and then show it to their friends on party night. Alot of overacting, underacting and poor acting. The plot itself could have been a winner with better writers, directors and actors. I generally like low budget indie films of the slasher/terror type. Not this time! It was just too stupid and amaturish to get me to feel anything about the characters or what they were doing. I found myself fastforwarding alot to get to something more interesting. There were a couple of good violent scenes, and a fair love scene, and a rape scene. None of them were worth the price of the dvd, however. If you are in high school, and you and your pals like to hang out and video tape yourselves and others for sport, then you will enjoy this film, and could use it as a learning tool. Wish I hadn't been sucked in to buying this, felt like I was Tied Up and having to watch it!",1312588800,7,1069,4.323383084577115
8347369,5,B001WB6MEE,"Oh wow, are you kidding me!?!  Tied Up is downright brilliant!  I knew nothing about this.  I had super low expectations.  Plus I had tons of other flicks I kinda felt more inclined to watch.  But this was a gift from a friend, so I had to give it a spin.  And hot diggity dog, am I glad I did.

You want action?  Check.  Comedy?  Yessir.  Violence, sex, awesome camera work, witty dialogue, originality, good character development, twists, turns, shocks, ...it's all here.  Even the acting is pretty decent.  Man I still can't believe it.

This is the story of Case, a young man with little going for him.  Cruddy parents, no job, cheatin girlfriend, questionable best friend.  His life seems to be spiraling down the road to nowhere, until he devises a desperate plan to score some loot.  He persuades his so called friends into helping him rob an apparent stranger who has a hidden stash of cash.  But there is much more in store here as Case secretly seeks out his vengeance.

I'm not gonna say much more about this, except it is perhaps the most highly entertaining flick you could ever possibly watch.  No joke.  Buy this immediately.

Thanks Alex!",1293840000,8,1154,4.58128078817734
8347370,5,B001WB6MEE,Very good explotation movie.  Don't see many of these anymore.  A low budget classic that must be seen to be appreciated.  I suggest this movie to anyone who is a fan of cult movies!,1255392000,,182,4.294117647058823
8347371,5,B001WB6MEE,"Reminiscent of 1960s/1970s exploitation films, ""Tied Up"" has everything you want in an underground film: lesbians, drugs, rape, masturbation, boobs, torture, and murder.  How can you go wrong?",1250726400,7,192,5.857142857142857
