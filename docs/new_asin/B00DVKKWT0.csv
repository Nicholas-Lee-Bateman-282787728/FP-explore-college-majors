5859804,5,B00DVKKWT0,"This is an amazing film about gender and poverty.

As I write this, a current You-Tube sensation is Samantha Gordon, a nine-year-old American football player. All the videos of her are exceptionally violent, because American football is a violent sport.

Putting nine-year-old girls into a boxing ring is no more brutal or backward than putting little Samantha in at running back. And yes, these girls carry the financial burden of their families, as does every nine-year-old planting rice in Asia. There are nine-year-olds carrying machine guns in Africa.

The families in America who exploit their children on ""Dance Moms"" or ""Toddlers in Tiaras"" are doing the exact same thing as the parents of the ""Buffalo Girls.""  So if you watch this film and your reaction is ""I'm glad I live in America,"" you're having the wrong reaction.",1394323200,7,830,5.036496350364963

8598314,5,B00DVKKWT0,"Yes this film drew me in immediately.. The Humbling tale. Was so shocking..
Life changing
Beautiful
Emotional.

Everything everything about this was educational and wonderful.
I felt many things from this film.. From the proudness and the power of being female..
So much respect for these girls as martial artists.., but definitely or a shock of the industry plus the nature that they were doing it,  authentic it was everything.. I'd  definitely share this with others.
These kids fighting have more discipline and skill than most adults I've known in a lifetime
And you've got to see this story and why they do it",1513382400,,615,4.894230769230769
