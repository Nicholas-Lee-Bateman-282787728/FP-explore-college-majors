7599145,5,B01AD981EO,"First, some technical details.  This is a British import, selling for $31.04; it can be bought from Amazon.co.uk for approximately $18.50.  It will not play on an American dvd player, but it will play on an all-regions player, which Amazon.com sells.  I have two made by Pioneer, the average price approximately $100.  Bottom line: with an all-regions player you can get British programming earlier and, often, less expensively.  The new players are simple to use.  You don't need to program them; you simply insert the disc, the machine reads the regional code and plays your show.  I have been very happy with my Pioneer all-regions players and recommend them highly.

Now: Shetland, series 3.  This is superb.  Reviewers on Amazon.co.uk (28 to date) are giving it 4.8 stars.  I agree completely with that assessment; series 3 takes a solid series to an entirely new level.

Series 3 consists of 6 one-hour episodes but with a single, continuous story.  A young man on the Lerwick ferry is found locked in a container.  SPOILERS: he has suffocated to death.  He encountered another, older man on the ferry with whom he shared a common tattoo, one that links each of them to Glasgow.

I do not want to disclose much more of the plot because it will spoil the entire series.  Suffice to say that Jimmy Perez (played with greater and greater skill and intensity by Douglas Henshall) must travel to Glasgow to investigate a succession of crimes in an attempt to discern the manner in which they are interconnected.

The series includes guest appearances by three significant British actors/actresses: Anna Chancellor, James Cosmo and Ciaran Hinds.  Their star power suggests that their characters may play specific sorts of roles in the major plot arc, but be wary of preconceptions.  Series 3 of Shetland is marked by twists and turns of the sort that might be encountered in a Jeffery Deaver novel.

The cinematography is spectacular.  The scenes manage (as some have commented) to be both vast and vacant, evoking the spirit of Kenneth Branaghs Wallander series.  The acting is first rate, the plot line engaging with muted violence and menace all around us.  Since the British detectives do not carry weapons (unlike Kurt Wallander and his American counterparts), confrontation scenes become battles of wills and verbal intensity.  Alison ODonnell (Jimmys DS Tosh) has a standout role in this series and gives a particularly memorable performance.

Fans of the series are in for a treat as series 3 raises an already-high bar and takes the show to the upper reaches of British crime drama.  Do not miss it.",1460073600,6,2608,4.935632183908046

I did find though that having the storyline broken up into so many episodes made following the story somewhat difficult. I was also sad to see that Anne Cleeves is no longer associated with her creation.",1491868800,3,266,4.5625

Regardless of region, streaming, or DVD ownership (my preference),
The scenic islands of Shetland are to die for, such beauty to behold. The accents will make you fall in love with these Scots from the opening scenes. The music is enchanting, a sojourn all by itself, and nominated for a BAFTA. It is a poetic enticing series and thena body is found. A man trapped alive inside a semi loaded with scrap clothing headed overnight on a boat-ferry for recycling on the mainland. Glasgow becomes a second location for this two sides of the waters murder mystery that becomes so much more. DI Perez (Douglas Henshall) is back with his assistance coming from Wilson (Steven Robertson), and daughter/cop Alison (Alison ODonnell- yes, she plays a role with her real given name) who also gets caught up in terrible circumstances which becomes yet another mystery plot.
Best TV Drama of Scotland in 2016. Henshaw won Best TV Actor too.

Created from Ann Cleeves crime novels. It is a captivating nearly 6 hours of crime mystery viewing. Youll be glad you own the DVD even with no bonus material.
SDH SUBTITLES in English for those needing them for hearing loss and the delightful but hearty accents.
Perez even gets a bit of romance, although yet struggling with his past loss, with cop Asha (Archie Panjabi The Good Wife). Julie Graham (Bletchley Circle) returns to this series with the role of Rhona Kelly; I love her performance.",1485648000,,1625,5.274131274131274
8747130,5,B01AD981EO,We love the series.  I even bought an all region DVD player so I could get this series (as well as others) before they are released in Region one format. (The player works very well.),1471564800,,183,4.228571428571429
8747131,4,B01AD981EO,"A little difficult to understand at times.  Very dark and moody.  But good acting and good stories.  If you don't think you can go there in person, here's the next best way to visit the Shetland islands.",1469836800,,203,4.4324324324324325

8747133,4,B01AD981EO,"not quite as good as series 1, but worth watching.  the main problem is doing a whole season around one crime (a la forbrydelsen, but not as well done).  the script goes off in too many directions rather than being solidly centered, like series 1.  buy it anyway.
since many people don't have 100 bucks for an all region player, you can get good players for as little as 30 dollars online.  it doesn't have to be a pioneer.  there are also players which are available in stores which can be converted with the remote in 10 seconds, like the philips dvp2800 ($30 at target / remote code free at the videohelp website).  region 2 discs from the u.k. site are always cheaper & released sooner.  fine art doesn't have to be expensive if you do a little legwork.",1462233600,,757,4.402877697841727
