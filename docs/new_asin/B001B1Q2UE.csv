3479698,4,B001B1Q2UE,"A nice low impact dance like excersize video. It was fun and easy. I especially like the outdoor atmosphere. It was just the kind of low impact workout that I was looking for... something to gradually get the heart pumping, but not kill me in the process.",1235174400,2,255,4.446808510638298
3479699,2,B001B1Q2UE,The moves are a little difficult to follow and a bit too rigorous for me.,1234396800,,73,3.933333333333333
3479700,2,B001B1Q2UE,"Routines were too long and the music was not inspiring at all.  For a Latin dance, you need true salsa, merengue, etc.",1234310400,2,118,4.363636363636363
3479701,2,B001B1Q2UE,"If you are looking to get moving, this is a nice work-out.  If you are looking to get great exercise, look elsewhere.",1229212800,4,117,4.318181818181818
3479702,5,B001B1Q2UE,"I have this DVD & the other Dance and Be Fit program, Brazilian Body. I think the music in both of them is great! One of the reviewers commented about too much drum but the music is SUPPOSED to be secondary to Desi's instruction. The DVD also provides a music option to let you turn off the instruction and just hear the music. It's a fun way to work up a sweat, the moves are easy to follow and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to mix up their cardio routine.",1226534400,10,466,4.076086956521739
3479703,5,B001B1Q2UE,I love this program! I like it because a. I am working out and getting fit and B. I'm learning exotic dances without having to go to a ballroom dance class. It's fun to bust out my moves on the dance floor and impress the boys. The music is motivating as is the instructor. Ayayay!,1226448000,2,281,4.127272727272727
3479704,2,B001B1Q2UE,"very disappointing. Most of the workout is just aerobic moves that have been used on everybody's video for years.  Not much to learn about Latino dancing. Also it seems the people in the video heard music they are not letting us hear because they seem to be having fun.  There is a continuous drum beat but it's not music. The second half does have a little music, but by then, I couldn't stand one more beat on the drum.
I whould rename this ""Just another aerobic workout with a drum beat added after the fact video"".",1226188800,5,518,4.385416666666667
3479705,4,B001B1Q2UE,"The moves are similar to NIA and Zumba. It's Latin dance. The pace is good and it presents in 4 parts: warm-up, dance moves, more dance moves, cool down. If you were a beginner you could stop after the first set of dance moves. However, the lack is in the calls. They are not that good, even though this is ""over-narrated"" to eliminate that problem and allow continuous dance without the leader having to make the calls. My only complaint is the calls. They are mostly late, not said at all when changes are about to come and you end up floundering about trying to keep up. After about 4 or 5 runs you know them and then they become all the more annoying because they are not on cue. The one thing that none of these fitness videos do is allow you to shut off their voice once you know the moves and listen to the music without the interruption. I'd love that. I'd buy that video in a second!",1379635200,,892,4.222222222222222
3479706,3,B001B1Q2UE,Tried this workout because I like some of the others in the series. I thought it was pretty easy and really repetitive.,1374624000,,119,4.454545454545454
3479707,5,B001B1Q2UE,"I really love this video; it's fun, just the right length, and features pretty Hawaiian scenery. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Zumba.",1373241600,,140,4.875
3479708,4,B001B1Q2UE,"I'm an author and tend to spend a lot of my time sitting in front of a computer. I wanted something that would be fun to add to my daily routine of going for a mile walk and yoga. I found it in this dance workout. What I like best about it is my two daughters can spend time with me and do the workout as well and to them...it's just dancing with mom.

For the advance Zumba queen, you might want something else, but for those looking into doing a dance workout for the first time or wanting a workout routine you can do with little kids in the house, I highly suggest this one. You do feel the burn but it isn't too advanced either so you can enjoy a great workout.",1364515200,,666,3.970149253731343
3479709,2,B001B1Q2UE,"I was definitely expecting more of an impact, a slight sweat would have been better than none. Most Latin dance workouts are great for cardio, this is more of a really long warm up.",1361491200,,181,4.352941176470588
3479710,5,B001B1Q2UE,She was a good teacher. Showed you how to slow and after you got the hang of it you could do it with out her talking and just the music.,1359072000,,136,3.566666666666667
3479711,1,B001B1Q2UE,"I lasted about 4 minutes into this video. There was little instruction, and the music was just awful. I think it would be better for someone who knows the moves.",1352073600,,161,4.4
3479712,4,B001B1Q2UE,I own a miriad of dance workout videos and rotate them frequently to prevent boredom.  I bought this one as an Amazon instant vid and just finished the workout.  The routines are simple so you don't have to pause the workout to learn them. Great fun!  Worked up a light sweat.  I highly recommend if you are new to dancing because the choreography is not overwhelming and you can start dancing right away.  Puts a smile on your face!,1320969600,,433,4.430379746835443
3479713,5,B001B1Q2UE,"This was a very easy to follow dance workout video.  I have many Latin dance exercise videos, but many of these are hard to follow. This was easy to follow and fun.  Desi is very good at explaining the moves.  It is a good low impact exercise video for beginners who want to learn latin dance moves.",1316304000,,299,4.2105263157894735
3479714,5,B001B1Q2UE,"If you are a beginner and you did not break a sweat, it means tht you are not engaging your muscles as you should. I just went through this rep; the sweat is still on my body as I am writing this review. You should not go wrong with this workout video.",1309132800,,252,3.8653846153846154
3479725,1,B001B1Q2UE,"I just did this video and I just can't believe how bad it was...

As for the voiceover...  I have done dance videos before with voiceover and have never been annoyed.... until this.  It was so annoying and the fake laughing she would do throughout was just... gross.

As for the workout... can't even call it a workout.  Never broke out into heavy breathing and never broke out in a sweat.

I am shocked that there are any good reviews...  though I guess for someone completely new to Latin moves this may be good for them...

That was just a huge waste of time I'll never get back.",1305849600,3,582,4.324074074074074
3479726,1,B001B1Q2UE,"I love dance workouts, but this is one of the worst I have seen. The ""instruction"" is a voice over, and the ""dancers"" 3 robots with frozen fake smiles. The music is typical Mexican restaurant Muzak. The warm-up is way too long and repetitious; at least the 2nd workout does not begin with a warm-up. The routines are typical, uninspiring, unfun, and don't raise the heart rate. Cool down is almost 10 minutes as well, some point your toes, tai chi, yoga-inspired snooze fest. Nothing good to say about this workout, because you don't even really get a workout! I'll never watch this video, or any in the series again.",1304208000,3,617,4.618181818181818
3479727,3,B001B1Q2UE,"While I did not love this DVD, I thought it was fun and I did break a sweat.  The only reason it receives three stars instead of five is that the moves are somewhat repetitive which would result in me only coming back to this video periodically, but a great additional to an already well stocked dance video library.",1274659200,,316,4.3559322033898304
3479728,2,B001B1Q2UE,"I'm sorry to say I did not like this workout dvd.  I'm not a consistent fitness fiend,  but still workout every now and again.  This DVD is very simple and low impact and not what I desired when I thought it was a latin dance workout.  If you are new to working out I guess this would work for you, but I don't feel it burned enough energy for me to count as an effective workout.  I actually quit towards the end because there was not enough energy to keep me going.  I would not buy this dvd.",1271808000,4,494,3.989795918367347
3479729,3,B001B1Q2UE,"My biggest complaint was the instruction.  The instructor would tell you which move to do or when to switch after the people on screen have already switched, so you constantly have to watch the screen to see when they are switching.",1267920000,3,232,4.658536585365853
3479730,4,B001B1Q2UE,"I am in my late 40s and totally out of shape.  I bought this DVD because I wanted a fun workout.  This is perfect for me and anyone who has not exercised in a very long time.  The warm-up really prepares my body for the main exercise routines.  The workout steps and routines are described very well making them easy to follow.  Each routine, the merengue and salsa, is 20 minutes apiece.  I could do only one if I am crunched for time, for a total of 35 minutes including warm-up and cool down.  The very first time I tried this, my potbelly was in the way (bending down to touch my head to my knee).  Don't feel frustrated if you have a hard time in your first week; it gets easier every time you do it. In less than a month, I feel physically fit, I sleep really well and I am ready for a more challenging dance workout DVD!",1255132800,19,827,4.093167701863354
3479731,5,B001B1Q2UE,My friend and I did this DVD together.  We both really enjoyed it and we are at very different levels.  I would recommend this to people of all levels. Desi's instuction was great and she kept us motivated.,1239321600,2,206,4.394736842105263
3479732,5,B001B1Q2UE,"I didn't even think I could dance. But what fun and it works for me. I use it at least 3 times a day. Thank you, Desi. When does the next DVD come out?",1239321600,,151,3.4705882352941178
3479733,5,B001B1Q2UE,"This is a cool workout, because it is fun and will kick your butt. I bet it would be even cooler to use the dance moves, but I am not a great dancer -- I just really like the workout.",1239062400,,183,3.6
3479734,4,B001B1Q2UE,"This product was recommended to me by a friend. She does this work out whenever she can't make it to the gym. I thought I would go ahead and give it a try and I love it! It keeps you moving and sweating.
After watching it a couple times you don't even need the instruction and you can actually set it to just music.",1235865600,,315,3.9375
8281396,4,B001B1Q2UE,It is a nice workout.,1486339200,,21,3.4
8281397,5,B001B1Q2UE,Works great to loosen up my hips. The dances are not too challenging for a beginner to learn. And the stretches in the dance warm-up are wonderful!,1461628800,,147,4.481481481481482
8281398,1,B001B1Q2UE,It stunk dancing was way to slow and voice in background was to annoying to even relax!,1459209600,,87,4.176470588235294
8281399,1,B001B1Q2UE,I was so dissatisfied. Desi repeats the same few moves over and over again!! Her technique of the latin dance moves are also incorrect. And then she giggles every now and then...,1458345600,,178,4.59375
8281400,5,B001B1Q2UE,GREAT,1447891200,,5,5.0
8281401,4,B001B1Q2UE,"Good work out, but a little hard to follow at first.",1446940800,,52,3.8181818181818183
8281402,4,B001B1Q2UE,This is a lite and happy dance program perfect for beginners. Easy moves give you a lighter workout that is perfect for an easier workout day.,1445644800,,142,4.5
8281403,1,B001B1Q2UE,This sucks...it is like a geriatrics version of Latin...not even Latin. I HATED it!,1421280000,,83,5.0
8281404,1,B001B1Q2UE,"I could not get into this workout.  I finished 1 of the 20 minute workouts, but there was no way that I was going to try to do another one.  First of all, the warm up was sooooo long.  I was wondering what the workout was going to be like if the warmup was this long.  I haven't warmed up this much for a Cathe Friedrich workout and those are TOUGH!  When I finally got to the workout, it did not match the warmup, but even more so, it just did nothing for me.  It was just blah.  The lead smiled throughout the whole workout which is fine, but it didn't add anything to the workout.  The voiceover of the instructor was the real problem.  Absolutely horrid cueing and her incessant giggling was just annoying.  The music was the same throughout and not very inspiring.  So, I won't be pulling this out again.  If you are still curious, pick this one up at the library to see if you like it first as you may like it; however it was not for me.",1417737600,,943,4.092896174863388
8281405,2,B001B1Q2UE,"I found the moves to be very simple, not interesting, and the instructor did not make them look terrific either.  The merengue segment was worse than the salsa segment.",1401926400,,168,4.793103448275862
