1076120,2,6305797064,"No, that ain't the premise of this flick. That's what SHOULD HAVE been done to the director of this Grade Z film. The Spencer Davis Group is the only worthwhile thing in the movie and it's great to see these guys having fun, singing and giving each other sly looks like ""this movie IS bad, ain't it?"" Okay, so the ghost goes gear. They show this ghost once, for a few seconds, maybe twice. It has nothing to do with the plot....then the director fills up the allotted time with lame British bands that plod through crummy songs till the end of the movie. So why did I give it TWO stars? Because, bad film or not, it's still a piece of 60's nostalgia and it's fun to watch for that reason and to see the Spencer Davis Group (who do a terrific job). In comparison, it makes PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE look like STAR WARS.",977270400,2,816,4.203821656050955

7895115,5,6305797064,"A glimpse, or snapshot, of a time when rock'nroll seemed to be innocent, upbeat fun. Everyone in the movie looked like they were having a blast--playing the music and acting in the movie. Interesting to see some famous stars, such as Spencer Davis and Steve Winwood when they were very young. So cute.

Listening to commentary is a must. Lots of interesting background information.",1351123200,,381,4.953125
7895116,4,6305797064,"Jumping on the ""Hard Day's Night"" bandwagon and featuring worse gags and production values than any episode of ""The Monkees,"" the infinitely more ridiculous ""The Ghost Goes Gear"" follows the comedic exploits of The Spencer Davis Group in a haunted house. That's it. Even though that probably tells you enough to decide if you want to see it or not, more comments are in order. This was once a quite obscure film, but the fine people at Anchor Bay recovered it, cleaned it up, and added a wonderful commentary from Spencer Davis and humorist Martin Lewis. The film looks and sounds beautiful, and if you have ever wanted to see it, this will definitely satisfy you.

For a bit of full disclosure, I am a casual fan of The Spencer Davis Group and a bigger fan of Steve Winwood's later career, which is why this caught my eye. The plot begins when the group's manager invites them to his huge and haunted family estate, with his crazy mother and father and kooky servants in residence. Many shenanigans ensue: learn if drums float; see Steve Winwood push a wheelbarrow; get a load of some absolutely wretched physical comedy (particularly the painful ""we're looking for a fish"" scene); check out the groovy clothes; there's even a botany lesson and a pseudo-kidnapping (don't ask); and, of course, let's not forget the presence of the singing Elizabethan ghost with a guitar. Director Hugh Gladwish never made another movie after this one, and you will see why. (The joke on the commentary was that he had said all there was to say about the human condition here, so how could he top this?) Indeed, this became a dead end for many of the cast and crew members, although some continued on in sundry other projects.

Nicholas Parsons plays the manager, Algernon Rowthorpe Plumley (""Algie,"") with vigor and understated panache in what is easily the best performance in the film, but nothing can really help the material, particularly given the directorial direction the film took. I had an especially difficult time taking Polly the maid's (Sheila White) endless mugging for the camera, not to even mention her singing and dancing (which makes Elaine Benes look positively graceful.) At least she's dancing to a Steve Winwood instrumental piece, so just close your eyes and enjoy the soundtrack. Speaking of the soundtrack, the film's musical director was John Shakespeare, who with his wife Joan, were largely in charge of the musical selections chosen. Interestingly, they stayed away from The Spencer Davis Group's hits, and went with more obscure songs from their then-contemporary set list, which is a mixed blessing. Some of the choices are tepid, while others are inspired: I especially loved Steve's somewhat country-bluesy version of ""Midnight Special"" which lyrically appears to substitute ""Wooster"" for ""Houston,"" though even after listening three times I wasn't quite sure if it was his accent or a deliberate nod to the UK audience. Whatever the case, it's the highlight of the film. Understand, of course, that everything is lip-synched with no live playing present in the film. Not that it's a great loss, as the studio versions undoubtedly would sound better anyhow, but at least plug cords into the guitars. Speaking of gaffes, continuity was provided by Margot Vanderpant: watch out for minor but amusing continuity errors.

Sadly, most of the music is not provided by The Spencer Davis Group, and many utterly forgettable groups have their moment of fame singing at the concert at Rowthorpe Hall (actually filmed at Puttenden Manor, Lingfield, Surrey) when the plot degenerates entirely in the musical garden party designed to save Algie's childhood estate. This is, of course, just an excuse to showcase badly lip-synched cut rate pop songs at a haunted house. The good news is you can spot some really cool vintage electric guitars if you care. (It beats paying attention to the music itself most of the time.) The musical tedium is somewhat like a 1960s variety show, most of which happens in the courtyard of the home, though some artistically drifts further afield, which is particularly noteworthy in the wretched numbers from Dave Berry, who likes to hide in trees and behind things (note the oddest use of Queen Anne's lace ever in a music video....I hope he wasn't an allergy sufferer.) After acts like Acker Bilk, The Lorne Gibson Trio, The St. Louis Union (they get a lot of screen time,) The Three Bells, and M6 (yes, named after the English highway, and featuring a peculiar dual lead singer arrangement) have their say, the film ends in a decidedly silly and anticlimactic manner. If I had finished the DVD there I would have been generally disappointed, certainly unamused, and feeling profoundly ripped off from a musical perspective. I probably would have given the film two stars generously, and forgotten about it. Then I watched it with the commentary.

The commentary with the good-natured Spencer Davis, and exceptionally knowledgeable Martin Lewis totally made this movie worthwhile. Rarely has a commentary track been so much better than the underlying material: it was an absolute joy to listen to and was much more entertaining than the film itself. The two are very conversational, and recollect much about the film and people behind it. I was amused to listen to the discussion of Nicolas Parsons playing a pre-Python ""Upper Class Twit"" possibly inspired by Peter Sellers. Likewise the attitudes of the individual band members about the movie were insightful: drummer Pete York was wildly enthusiastic and was clearly the ham of the group; Davis was likewise enthusiastic; Muff Winwood less so, and Steve Winwood is described as the least interested in the project, which makes total sense given his subsequent departure for Traffic and career. The commentary frequently departs on wild and hilarious tangents such as Davis' good teeth and dental care regimen, a discussion of traditional Morris dancing (enjoy the otherworldly thread connecting it with the ""Safety Dance""!), the history of speed limits in Britain, a recollection of Dave Berry as the most successful artist in the history of the Dutch pop music charts (!), and even a humorous analogy of The Three Bells as ""an early 'Spice Girls' without the spice."" To reveal more of their insight and wit would perhaps make it less enjoyable to hear firsthand, but believe me when I tell you this commentary is both fascinating from a historical perspective, and personally funny from a crucial participant in the 1960's music scene.

After watching the film and the commentary I recommend ""The Ghost Goes Gear"" to anyone with an affinity for 1960s music, and particularly for fans of Spencer Davis or Steve Winwood. The film itself is what you would probably expect from reading the first sentence of my review (maybe even a little worse,) but the commentary goes a long way toward redeeming this pop music oddity. Enjoy it for what it is, but whatever you do, don't stop without watching the commentary.",1334448000,4,7000,5.0
7895117,2,6305797064,"This was a film I was really looking forward to seeing. I rented this from Blockbuster Online based upon the description. A Beatles/Monkees type movie with the Spencer Davis Group?! It sounded like a lot of fun, if for no other reason than to hear the band. After about 20 minutes I simply could not take it any more and had to turn it off. Brutal. I give it 2 stars only because it has some band performance footage. Too bad you have to sit through that incredibly boring and dumb ""plot"" to get to the good stuff. I certainly couldn't do it. And I like watching offbeat oddball movies, but they still have to at least ENTERTAIN. This one did not.",1177891200,,647,4.311475409836065
7895118,3,6305797064,"A friend lent me the DVD of THE GHOST GOES GEAR, since I tend to get a kick out of 1960s rock 'n' roll comedies. The good news is that The Spencer Davis Group, in what I believe is their only film of this type, is very likable and even shows a bit of a flair for knockabout comedy (their drummer is particularly fun to watch, and young Stevie Winwood, while quiet, is certainly easy on the eyes). The bad news is that what little plot there is, nonsense about the boys' Upper Class Twit manager and his haunted family estate (interestingly, the ghost haunting it is smilingly played by Roger Daltrey lookalike Lorne Gibson, who also sings in the film with his group The Lorne Gibson Trio), takes up an inordinate amount of screen time and makes a typical SCOOBY-DOO episode look like the best of Hitchcock. When the jokes are funny, it's a happy accident of delivery and timing -- otherwise, the flick's pretty much just an excuse to string together musical numbers featuring all-but-forgotten British folk and pop acts of the time (including Mr. Acker Bilk!). If you love The Spencer Davis Group, though, you'll find it worthwhile to turn on the commentary track -- and not just because it drowns out the rest of the film! :-) Spencer Davis and Martin Davis (no relation :-) tell lots of funny off-the-cuff stories about the film's creation and the folks involved, and even they cheerfully admit that the film is, er, flawed and that most of the folks in it barely even qualify as footnotes in British pop history. In fact, the Davis & Davis commentary is the only reason I gave the DVD a 3-star rating instead of a 2-star rating. So if you're in the mood for a curiosity and you've got a pal who can loan this DVD to you (so you don't have to spend actual money on it :-), THE GHOST GOES GEAR is worth one viewing, especially if you gather a bunch of friends who love to do a DIY MST3K number on such films (like my hubby did when we watched it :-)!",1120348800,,1951,4.392265193370166
7895119,1,6305797064,"This movie is so awful you have to love it! I can't believe someone actually directed it - no...I can't believe that someone actually CHOREOGRAPHED it!  What's with the dance in the kitchen with the apples?  LOL!  The ""plot"" of the movie is as follows:  The Spencer Davis Group (a bunch of merry madcaps) have a manager who has an olde ancestorial home.  His daffy parents have no money to feed the  electric meter, so the group hatches the idea to exploit the ""Elizabethan"" ghost (LOL! greasy pompadour and all) to bring in tourists.  They also ask tourists to BYOB - that is, Bring Your Own Band.  The entertainment that shows up is ridiculously fantastic - Dave Berry who sings about his mama as he climbs down a tree in his Beatle boots, or hides in a field peeking through weeds while singing something called ""Now"", Polly, the maid, making wierd facial contortions and dance moves that can only be described as spastic,and The Three Belles - be-wigged homely gals who strike poses as they sing ""Danger Zone""  and ""I'm the Original Lemon Tree""??????  There are other groups, but none so entertaining as these.  I did enjoy the Spencer Davis group - I wonder if this movie embarrasses them now?  Anyhoo, for a good laugh and some enjoyable tunes (""Midnight Special""  ""Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out"") this is the movie for you.",1105660800,5,1342,4.659574468085107
7895120,3,6305797064,"I thought maybe there was a movie here...whew! HORRIBLY boring British chatter & aimless, silly story, BUT this is off a really sharp looking print of some obscure British mod-style groups. If nothing else, get this movie for this footage - there are some really nice segments of the artists if you've even heard of them. Not essential, but get it used or on eBay for a few bucks to add to your collection. If only the groups were a bit more popular (besides Spencer Davis), the music bits are superb. Story - blah...music, great!",1051574400,,530,4.589473684210526
7895121,3,6305797064,"I know very little about the Spensor Davis Group except for a few of their songs and that Steve Winwood was a member. I decided to view this movie because I had enjoyed the Monkees' movie ""Head"" and Herman's Hermits' ""Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter.""
The actual movie is a terrific period piece that is light on plot (the ghost is barely in the film!) but it does contain performances by not only the Spensor Davis Group, but other obscure groups that I believe most Americans are not familiar with. Acker Bilk and His Paramount Jazz Band are very entertaining, as are the proto-Spice Girls act The Three Bells.
The audio commentary by Spensor Davis and Martin Lewis is informative not only about the making of the film, but also about the music scene happening in the UK at that time. Even if you don't care for the film, you will want to hear the commentary if you enjoy music from the 1960s.
The film quality is excellent and is presented in widesceen. One thing I wish the DVD would have included was captioning and a trailer (if one was made for the film.)",1022976000,3,1071,4.469387755102041
7895122,3,6305797064,"After the Beatles made it big with ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help"", there were a slew of copycat movies cranked out by the music industry. ""Ghost Goes Gear"" is one such attempt to capitalize on the success of Beatlemania.
To be perfectly honest, I didn't want to like this film. Overall, I thought it was Monkees-lite. And any attempt at sticking with a storyline goes out the window about twenty minutes in. This is unfortunate, because the film would be far more memorable if the slick madcap weirdness of the opening segments could have been maintained. However, I wound up thinking the movie wasn't half-bad, for what it was.
Some have criticized the director, Hugh Gladwish, for letting the plot get lost, but I think he did pretty good with the rest of it. Visually, the film has some minor flair. The camera motion is reserved, yet fluid when called for. And I was struck by how sharp the focus was throughout the whole film. I also liked the Monkees-ish drum chase down the river in the opening segment, and the umbrella-march to Rowthorpe Hall. The Spencer Davis Group isn't too bad at Monkee-like mugging for the camera. The lads are pleasant enough, and do their best. The ghost is kind of funny, too. There is even a touch of Python in the proceedings.
Two personalities stand out in the rest of the cast; Jack Haig will be instantly recognizable to fans of the Britcom ""'Allo, 'Allo!"" And Nicholas Parsons is interesting as the uptight band manager, sort of a cross between John Cleese and Paul Lynde.
The audio commentary is more about the music scene in England at the time of the film, rather than about the film itself. This commentary was enjoyable, though, and informative. Spencer Davis and humorist Martin Lewis readily joke that the film was a black hole for just about everyone career-wise.
The Spencer Davis Group is not bad at cooking up the groovy tunes. The other acts are instantly forgettable, save for the Paramount Jazz Band which seems rediculously out of place in the movie (the commentary explains that, in reality, the jazz band fits for the era). And Dave Berry is just plain annoying with his weird, hide-his-face foolishness. Thank goodness he only has two songs!
The Three Belles are an odd act, too. As Spencer and Martin Lewis remark in the commentary, they appear to be the inspiration for Austin Powers' Femmbots. In their first number, look for the middle Belle, who is the only one who seems to know how to react to the camera. One gets the sense that the producers just lined up whoever was available, but not bigger than the Spencer Davis Group.
Of course, Stevie Winwood fans will want to see the film, but he really doesn't do much acting-wise. Spencer and Peter York do most of the work there.
There's no naughtiness whatsoever, so you don't have to worry if your kids want to watch it (not that it will hold their attention past when the ""gear"" concert starts).
This slice of the Sixties British Invasion will undoubtedly be more interesting if you're into the Spencer Davis Group or the era, but the movie really holds more significance for the British audience than for anyone in the US.",1007856000,11,3140,4.679927667269439
7895123,3,6305797064,"You don't have to be a fan of 1960s ""British Invasion"" bands to enjoy ""The Ghost Goes Gear,"" but it surely helps.  In the wake of The Beatles' successful first film, ""Hard Day's Night,"" there were a host of films that featured British rock/pop bands of the era including, among others, Herman's Hermits (in ""Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter""), The Dave Clark Five (in ""Having a Wild Weekend,"" directed by John Boorman!) and this rarely seen 1966 film featuring The Spencer Davis Group that never even made it to the U.S. until 1999 as part of a film revival.  While ""The Ghost Goes Gear"" is a minor effort, it's certainly a lot of fun to watch, sort of a British version of ""The Monkees,"" especially during the first half of the film.  The second half of the film features musical numbers by obscure British musical acts of the era, the lone exception being Acker Bilk's jazz band.
Fortunately, the film is played broadly by the cast, and Spencer Davis and his bandmates, brothers Muff (bass guitar) and Steve Winwood (guitar and keyboards), and Peter York (drums) acquit themselves nicely.  Steve Winwood first made his musical mark with The Spencer Davis Group (""Gimme Some Lovin',"" ""I'm a Man"") and went on to greater success as a member of Traffic and, later, as a solo act.  Here, he's a very young looking 18 year old and is the quiet one of the group.  While the band doesn't play any of its hits here (at least those with which U.S. audiences would be familiar), musically, they are the best thing going in the film.  They perform a terrific, slightly country version of ""The Midnight Special"" that I found myself humming for several days after viewing the film.  The other acts perform pleasant, but instantly forgettable tunes.
Anchor Bay has done their usual great job in bringing this rarity to DVD.  The film is presented in the widescreen format from, reportedly, the only uncut print of the film known to exist.  There's also a very entertaining commentary track featuring Spencer Davis and humorist Martin Lewis.
The ""bottom line"" on ""The Ghost Goes Gear"" is that it is an enjoyable, lighthearted romp that harkens back to the days when rock and roll was much happier and less angst ridden.  View it in that context and you'll have a ""fab"" time.",1004313600,4,2269,4.690176322418136
