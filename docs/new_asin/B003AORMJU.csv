The strength training portion could stand to be amped up a tad but I just do a few more reps. The beauty of her DVDs is you feel comfortable deviating from her routine. She actually encourages it. She makes it so easy for beginners to tone the workouts down and still cranks it up for those walking veterans.
She does not have a cast in this one and I do prefer her without a cast. I feel that she does better at helping you keep the pace and motivating you when she is alone.
Leslie is so chipper and friendly that feel comfortable with her in your home. She is not yelling out orders like a drill sergeant. She keeps you moving and delivers 2 fast miles. I love this DVD!",1360195200,6,819,4.030674846625767
4104391,5,B003AORMJU,"I love this one because it is a straight forward 2 mile walk with just Leslie in her Studio. It moves at a nice pace and then you join her for some focussed lower body toning afterwards. You do some standing leg moves- almost like a barre routine, then down to the floor for more leg moves. The fit cuff adds resistance to the moves and it is a great cardio/toning session in about 55 mins.",1336435200,3,390,4.144736842105263
4104392,4,B003AORMJU,"I own a lot of Leslie's DVDs and I enjoy mixing my routines up and adding in extras such as Walk Away Your Hips & Thighs.  Give it a try, your legs will thank you.",1323388800,3,163,3.657142857142857
4104393,2,B003AORMJU,"This product came with only the dvd.  Apparently there should be a exercise device that is used for leg exercises.  You can not do the complete video without this device.  I definitely was not satisfied with this purchase. It should be noted before purchase that this doesn't include this device.  First time I've ever purchased something and wasn't pleased.

4104394,3,B003AORMJU,"You will need the Fit Cuffs for the firming part of the video. I didn't know that I would need it till I opened and watch the video. This is no fault of the seller and the exercises can be done without the cuffs but will be more effective with them. The seller did a great job and the cuff disappointment was no fault of him/her. I just want other buyers to know about the cuffs before purchasing.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-at-Home-Walk-Away-Your-Hips-Thighs/dp/B003AORMJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone Walk at Home - Walk Away Your Hips & Thighs</a>",1299283200,3,625,5.804347826086956

8393111,5,B003AORMJU,"I own several of Leslie's dvds, and I just recently discovered this older dvd that I wasn't aware of before.  The first section is a 2 mile walk, with Leslie alone and no group working out with her.  It started out rather slow and easy, but  built up to a quick pace, and I definitely got a good cardio workout.  The next section is sculpting.  I expected it not to be especially challenging, but I was totally wrong!  This is one of the best sculpting workouts that I have for hips and thighs, and it is challenging!!  But, as always, Leslie just kind of makes you feel that you can do it, and you do!  This was an excellent purchase, and highly recommended.",1504828800,,659,4.300813008130081
8393112,4,B003AORMJU,I like the workout.  It helps with my hips and thighs.  I use it 4-6 times per week.,1502064000,,84,3.611111111111111

8393118,5,B003AORMJU,"It works quickly if you do the full workout 3-4x a week including the firming part.  I lost 1 inch off my hips immediately, 2weeks.  I did watch my food intake and stopped eating before 7pm.  Heavier meals were breakfast & lunch, veggie for dinner.  lots of water.  That's my suggestion.  I also recommend her Ultimate 5day walk plan.
Very important to mention the firming cuffs were not included.  I purchased this dvd before from best buy when it came out initially, which means I already had the cuffs.  The dvd got destroyed accidentally.  I can't say how effective the video would be WITHOUT the cuffs.  I can suggest tying a band in a figure 8 to fit around the ankles to use as a substitute.",1381104000,3,698,4.468253968253968
8393119,4,B003AORMJU,The exercise routine was very do-able. I felt invigorated without leaving my living room or requiring anything more than good shoes. Especially great for winter.,1365552000,,161,5.48
