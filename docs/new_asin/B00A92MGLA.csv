5401518,4,B00A92MGLA,"This documentary by David France explores the early advent of AIDS, its impact on ""Ground Zero"" (in Greenwich Village), and the birth of the gay advocacy groups ACT UP and TAG.

Of course, given the topic, we know that many of those attractive, articulate and intelligent men we meet will be dead by the time the final credits run, but it is endlessly fascinating to see how smart the activists were and how quickly they learned everything they had to know in order to have credibility with the US FDA and with Big Pharma. They actually wrote the protocol for testing that surprised the federal agency with its professionalism and ease of application.

There are meetings in which the activists learn the art of the ""sound bite"" and are reminded to be passive and polite but express their outrage to any media in the area. It shows the ads they sponsored attacking President George H. W. Bush, it shows a defensive Bill Clinton dressing down an activist and surprisingly, it shows Patrick Buchanan agreeing with an ACT UP spokesman as opposed to a government official.

Several pharmaceutical companies began working with them and along with a little success, came internal squabbles. In one clip, playwright/ activist Larry Kramer blasts them for their petty quarrels while ""we are fighting a plague!""

Remember the AIDS quilt? The dumping of victims' ashes on the White House lawn? The Senate hearings? The Kaposi's Sarcomas? The advent of the three-way cocktail that ultimately saved thousands of lives? There is much, much more to see. I felt this 2012 Seattle International Film Festival entry was somewhat dated, but to the best of my knowledge, no one has documented the entire arc, so it's about time! Amazon.com will notify me when it's available.

This documentary has received a well-deserved nomination for Best Documentary in the 2013 Academy Awards.",1348444800,30,1863,4.977491961414791

5401532,5,B00A92MGLA,"Few protest movements since the civil rights battle of the 1950s and 1960s can claim they led to actual change in public policy.

Fewer still have been as dramatic, determined and rousing as the grassroots group ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) which arose in response to the AIDS crisis in the mid-1980s and whose story is told in the new documentary How to Survive a Plague.

Founded by playwright Larry Kramer in 1987, ACT UP fought a decadelong campaign against politicians, pundits, news reporters, scientists, doctors, the federal government, and pharmaceutical companies to bring attention to the so-called ""gay plague"" and to develop ways of fighting it.

Once formed, ACT UP established itself in the public consciousness with a superb slogan, ""Silence = Death. "" And it displayed its take-no-prisoners approach by adopting as its symbol the pink triangle, the marker gays were forced to wear by the Nazis.

It became notorious for its in-your-face stunts - invading Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York; placing a giant canvas condom over Sen. Jesse Helms' North Carolina house; breaking into the CBS News studios during a broadcast of the evening news; scattering the ashes of AIDS victims on the White House lawn.

But as director David France shows in How to Survive a Plague, ACT UP also spearheaded health education, set up support groups, produced policy papers, and spawned major growth in scientific research. It radically sped up the development of new drugs to combat AIDS and effected their rapid deployment in experimental trials and their approval by the Food and Drug Administration.

Before ACT UP came along, AIDS was a death sentence. By the mid-1990s, it had become a manageable disease.

France's film uses home movies and archival news footage to chronicle the work of activists Ann Northrop, Peter Staley, Iris Long, Bob Rafsky, and Mark Harrington as they organize ACT UP offensives, or sit quietly over a drink wondering how many of them will die before their goals are achieved.

How to Survive a Plague is assembled in a montage style that is hard to take at times - it cuts from found footage to contemporary interviews to home movies showing emaciated, ravaged AIDS patients nearing death, and back again to news footage.

It can feel inchoate, dropping the viewer in the middle of events without much context, and it exacts an emotional toll.

But its raw quality also makes it compelling viewing.",1474588800,,2450,4.997542997542998

5401547,1,B00A92MGLA,"I really want to believe the claims that this film makes.  Namely, that a group of spirited, talented activists could change not only public opinion about the prejudice of it's government, but the gov't itself in a positive way.  Unfortunately, the record doesn't support these claims.  Well, let me get this straight.  I do believe that ACT UP pressured many in gov't and the scientific communities to speak out against a biased bureaucracy.  But ultimately the deadly truth is that they were co-opted by pharmaceutical interests to facilitate a corporate agenda.  When you listen to the likes of Jim Eigo triumphantly extol the wisdom of pharmaceutical companies heeding the charge of ACT UP in such endeavours as the destruction of the FDA's efficacy laws, it is hard not to cringe in disbelief by this man's foolish pride.  Big pharma opened it's doors to ACT UP solely because they saw profits to be made - essentially with less rigorous trial periods, drugs could be brought to market quicker and laws protecting citizens from consuming them altered to benefit that cause.  It has had deadly consequences on the American public, and one that will no doubt when measured in the future prove to be one of the costliest blunders to human life made by well meaning activists.  The other deception propagated by David France and the ACT UP protagonists is that they somehow were responsible for the beginning of the trials on the new generation of AIDS medications, when in fact these studies had commenced a full three years prior to the formation of ACT UP.  Had France done his homework he would have found a much different tale to tell.  It is with sadness that I write this review, as I too so desperately want to find a success in these histories.  However, I reserve my harshest criticism for Peter Staley.  The brother of a Wall Street tycoon, Staley has created his own internet enterprise to reap large profits from the AIDS catastrophe.  It is disingenuous to make a documentary about this subject, where the central theme is the attack upon big pharma and fail to leave Staley's own profits out of it.  It strains the imagination to believe that France was ignorant of this.  The entire film thus becomes a twisted charade of propaganda and financial interests.  Don't buy it.  I feel very badly for Jim Eigo and his ilk having their idealism cleverly abused by Staley and his cronies.  But the data exists and they should do the research before doing any further cheerleading when in fact they helped destroy the decades old system of drug trials that were in place to protect the American people.  Like Reagan, the man they despise, ACT UP fought hard for deregulation and now the American people will suffer for their selfish demands.  You have killed many people my friends, not saved lives.",1423353600,2,2808,4.808333333333334

This documentary leads us through the early  days of HIV/AIDs and on into the early 1990s where some progress started to emerge from some a dismal time. It discuss the politicians who blatantly ignored the epidemic, and those who almost praised it.

I lived through these times as a much younger person, and this film certainly helps to put a lot of things back into perspective with historic news footage documenting not only the ignorant indifference of Presidents Reagan and Bush, but also the cruel, snide, sneering, hateful, gloating attitudes of national figures like Helms, Falwell, O'Connor, Gingrich and Buchanan. That is an awfully ugly history to see, but important to remember, and important to realize that their awful legacy is being passed on to a new generation of hatemongers like Santorum, Brown, Barber, Gallagher, and Dolan. But it's even more important to recognize as heroes the Kramers, Staleys, Harringtons, Longs, Northrops and others who found uncommon bravery in their everyday existences, and by so doing helped to save the lives of millions of people who would otherwise have been consumed by a disease without a cure.

The film documents how difficult it is to make a social movement work.

I was constantly impressed with how much archived video is collected in this documentary.  Some of the pieces are tremendously emotional - such as the police beating protesters, the outrage of Larry Kramer and the collective spreading of ashes on the White House lawn.  There are many more moments like these that will reach out from the screen at you.

For anyone that grew up during and/or lived through this period, it's a grim reminder of what the gay community tackled as people died hourly.  For anyone who was born after the ""crisis period"" had passed, this is a must see so you may gain a better comprehension of what a true grassroots battle requires - the urgency, the stamina, the unending battles. It makes the current day battles for marriage equality look like a picnic in comparison.

Indeed, at times very sad / very emotional, and at other times, a triumph of courage.  To see these people who led the fight in action, and to see some of them truly made it through alive is quite joyful amid the tremendous losses.

5401580,4,B00A92MGLA,"The 2012 documentary HOW TO SURVIVE A PLAGUE reminds me that some of the toughest mofos I've known were tough because they had to be.  They had to fight for rights others enjoyed simply by being born.  I speak of women, blacks, the poor, Jews, and, in the case of the fighters portrayed in this film, gay men.

As HOW TO SURVIVE A PLAGUE recounts, some of those battles were with one another as the 1980s gay community faced two epidemics in A.I.D.S. and the refusals of the government and drug companies to address the fatal disease.  A.I.D.S. hit, and A.C.T.U.P. (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) hit back, but different points of view caused division despite the need for unity.  Still, they prevailed, albeit at high costs.

Much of HOW TO SURVIVE A PLAGUE comprises amateur videotape from the 1980s and I wonder how many of the people behind those cameras lived to see their footage in this documentary.  I tip my hat to whoever coordinated the acquisition of all that video, as tracking down the footage necessary to tell this story must have required prodigious diligence.

It wasn't long ago that the AIDS epidemic was regarded as a little more than a lifestyle plague the gay community brought upon itself. The documentary charts the seething rage of a forgotten group as it learns to speak, and refuses to be ignored. Frankly, I watched this film and wondered whether the lessons it teaches can be translated into terms useful for marginalized Americans now shut out of the economy, and dying a quiet socio-economic death.

OK, here is a new documentary, with old footage about an old topic... tell me why I'm watching this again?  Maybe halfway into the film I start to understand what the filmmakers are trying to do: It's not about equipping you with information to help you survive, per se, but it's about the story of what a gay grassroots movement did to survive.

I'm not for homosexuality in any way, but to see footage of elected government officials telling these gay groups that they have the right to freedom of speech as long as they don't offend anyone was an abomination.

Certain individuals in these activist groups were at times playing that gay card too hard and their silliness (probably due to their youthfulness), kinda had me not taking them too seriously at times, but for the singular fact that the government they elected had shunned the ones they were tasked to help, I myself would have joined with these activists cause.

I lived through this time living with HIV, expecting to die before anything could be done. Young people today don't watch their friends drop like flies wasted away to concentration camp victims. Young people NEED to watch this film, but I just couldn't after about 35 minutes. It became just too painful. It pushed too many of my PTSD buttons, yet I feel it's an important film, demonstrating the power in activism. So many of us are alive today due to activism to change the way the FDA releases HIV drugs. We just didn't have the time for the usual drug approval process.",1364947200,22,888,4.481481481481482

5401594,5,B00A92MGLA,"HTSAP documents the efforts of gay activist groups Act Up and TAG to bring attention to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. There is fascinating archival footage (mostly self-shot by ACT UP) showing the activists at home, in planning meetings and at actions. These are intercut with up-to-date talking heads interviews with the activists who survived, especially Larry Kramer, Peter Staley Iris Long and

The documentary is pretty honest, showing the fractiousness of the movement. These people were seeing their loved ones die and were sick with worry about their own prospects for survival. There were times, though when I thought the film was self-serving. To believe their telling of the story, Act Up almost single-handedly battles Republican administrations and the FDA to get medicines approved to fight AIDS. They bullied and pushed to shrink the testing timeline, eventually achieving the 3-pill antiviral cocktail that is keeping many HIV victims alive today. But I wasn't sure how much difference their sit ins and office invasions helped matters or hurt them. Their first attempt at turning up the heat ended up in failure after failure. Still, the movement learned from its mistakes, got educated, and helped shift the testing protocols to include multi-drug approaches.

While a more dispassionate telling of the story is needed, there is no doubt that Act Up was a critical part of the attempt by ordinary citizens to get their government to focus on a deadly disease. Watching real people grapple with the unthinkable was very moving. To the point where this Catholic understood why the ""invasion"" of St. Patrick's Cathedral in NYC made sense as a way to bring attention to the Church's lack of compassion toward gays and AIDS. I was especially moved by the story of Bob Rafsky, a closeted gay man who married and had a daughter before coming out and splitting amicably from his wife. Watching Bob get sicker and sicker, while his family looked on, brought home the urgency he felt about defeating the disease. And to the point where the shocking treatment of the ashes of their loved ones made desperate sense.

HTSAP is neither a complete nor a totally objective look at the fight against AIDS. But it helps very much to humanize the participants, and to bring their raw anger, terror, resourcefulness and hope to the screen.",1363564800,2,2337,5.002570694087404

I remember the feeling of helpless as a nurse, no real treatment for my patients, family was rare, other students and health care personnel would try and avoid these people as if they had the plague. Well, yes, indeed, they did have a plague, and no one was doing anything to help, it seemed.

This is a film about the activists in the Gay Community, who gathered to fight this disease that was taking their lovers, friends and community. Act Up with Larry Kramer was loud and proud. They forced pharmaceutical companies to start working for medications, the Government to listen and care,,and the population who were doing nothing. Essentially Larry Kramer and his fellow men fought the plague, while most everyone else stood around and looked.

This was a horrible time, President Reagan disavowed all knowledge. Thousands of men were dying and very few cared. These men were and are heroes. Why so many did so little will never be forgotten. Today we have drugs that work in tandem that have made AIDS a chronic disease. The Gay Community saved themselves, no one else. What a deadly legacy we almost gave our fellow humans. Bless all those who are gone.

It highlights the amazing work of AIDS activists, many of whom didn't survive to see the positive results of their work.  When the government was refusing to acknowledge the AIDS epidemic people on the street rallied, educated themselves and fought for research and fast-tracking of medication to try and save lives.  Although not all efforts were initially successful eventually the efforts of activists and sympathetic doctors and researchers paid off with HIV/AIDS medication that has now saved millions of lives.  This film is intense but so important because it shows how direct action can truly make change.  It is important from a historical perspective but also from a strategic political perspective.  How do you make change in the face of intense discrimination, especially when it's truly a life and death situation?  This film tells that story.",1361923200,5,919,5.093333333333334

That is is the skeleton of the story. The blood, muscle and tissue is the magnificent courage and guts of these young people, some with HIV and some not, that DARED to look at the powers that be in this country and SCREAM ""I will not die quietly"", ""I have a RIGHT to BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT"", and perhaps the most important, the demands to be an active part of the drug treatment research treatment, approval and distribution protocol. I'm sure some of these peolple felt or knew, that this was for the next wave, that treatment would probably not come in time for them. That is where my first tears of love were shed. To spend the last part of your like confronting, agitating and demonstrating, rather than just throwing up your hands and getting and staying drunk and high (like many of us would.)
But there are WONDERFUL spots of humour in the film (i.e. giant condom on Jesse Helms' house.) Couldn't happen to a nicer guy-ick.
Now let's get to the heart of the film. Courage, guts, whatever you want to call it - these young people had it in amounts that most people, maybe myself included, cannot conceive. Those of us who are here today who are healthy with HIV due to the drug advacements that have come, all us us owe a huge debt to ACT UP for demanding change, change to discrimination laws, change to drug approval procedures, change to the law in regards to people with HIV and those who love and care for them. This film is a time capsule that brings us back to the not so long ago when HIV was a death sentence. The film does so with grace, honesty, focus and clarity. It is a superb document of an era when hope and anger were all we had. I was 26 in 1985 - I was tested, and when I got my answer back in 2 or 3 weeks (that's how long it took then) it was actally suggested to me to get my affairs in order. I will never forget it. Well, I did not get sick, and I found the courage to get of the unhealthy relationship I was in at the time, which I wrongly though was better than what was going on in the real world. But every single one of my friends, from that 1st group in the late 1970's, is gone now. And I am left, alone now, to make sure they are not forgotten. This film is a written guarantee of that, and a funny, tragic, and in the end magnificent staement of the bravery of people when they feel they have nothing left to lose.

Many people, young, creative, people, died, true.  There was a lot of homophobia and nasty invective from the far Christian Right, true.  Health care workers and doctors performed miracles of care and compassion, true. Researchers finally came up with effective treatments, true.  It was, and still is, a world-wide pandemic, true.  All of this was a dramatic story, true.  :HOWEVER: As one of those health care workers who worked in the field of HIV/AIDS care itself, I need to add, and I'm sure I'm going to generate a lot of hate mail and invective here, that the virus itself, deadly as it was, would not have had the chance to circulate, amplify, if you will, through out the gay community if that community had not indulged in the sexual promiscuity and exteme sexual practices that it did, in the early days of Gay Liberation.  It's just a reality that a virus, any virus, will find the best way to spread through ANY community that gives it a good chance to do, whether it is among hemaphiliacs, IVD users or gay men. This aspect is not touched on in this documentary. I admire those activists (and they weren't only in the US - see Zak Achmat)who took on the pharma industry and pressed for effective treatments, but where is there any discussion of the need for prevention?

I never had the perspective of a gay community dealing with their friends and families dying because of a nation's refusal to act.  I watched this with a gay friend of mine who lived in NY around this time.  It was horrific for him to watch and appalling to me.  The inspiration, pride, the fearlessness, dedication and willingness to be guinea pigs just to survive is stunning.

I liked the the infighting at the end was shown.  With so many passions from so many angles (health, political, community, family, activism) it would be very difficult to find one group to encompass all.

How to Survive a Plague  provided a very accurate if truncated look back to what it w as like when HIV first burst on the scene. From the conservative governments do nothing attitude that allowed the HIV virus to spread unchecked in the first 4 or so years to the birth of act up and the Gay Mens Health Crisis How to Survive a Plague is a spot on telling of one of the saddest and biggest preventable public health disasters in modern history. How to Survive a Plague reveals in detail the grim toll HIV \ AIDS took on gay mostly white gay men in the 1980's at the start of the HIV epidemic. Largely missing is anything talking about how HIV \AIDS is still ravaging communities of color even now as we speak. This DVD is more accurately named How to Survive a Plague if You Are \ Were A White Gay Man.

For white gay men the HIV pains are largely over. With the advent of the multi drug cocktail HIV is now said to be a treatable disease much like diabetes. I would not exactly believe the hype that HIV is treatable like diabetes. In many cases HIV treatment is down to just taking a few pills a  day but nagging infections and other health issues cause just enough problems that some people living with HIV today have a time with bouts of illness most people don't suffer.

Anyone and I mean anyone who actually lived through the beginning of the HIV \ AIDS epidemic remembers the AIDS wards where so many friends wasted away looking like concentration camp survivors at the bitter end. Nothing describes the experience of watching young 20 something buff gym fit men melt away into thin gaunt lifeless corpses right in front of your eyes. Anyone who lived through the beginnings of HIV when the doctors were powerless to prevent quick progression from HIV to what was then called FULL BLOWN AIDS

The title is  accurate compared to the death sentence an HIV diagnoses once was today people are surviving with HIV to a greater degree than has ever been known before. Yet a dose of realism is needed given that people still progress abet much more slowly to full blow AIDS and some die of it! There are drug resistant strains of HIV that cause its sufferers to progress more quickly to AIDS. We have learned so much about this horrible virus in the past 40 years but the doctors are still working frantically to stay in front of this fast mutating virus that cleverly hides its protein markers behind a wall of sugar.

How To Survive A Plague is an awesome look back into the beginnings of the HIV epidemic with its limited focus on mostly gay white men but this flaw in no ways invalidates its powerful message.",1485820800,8,2749,4.42094861660079
