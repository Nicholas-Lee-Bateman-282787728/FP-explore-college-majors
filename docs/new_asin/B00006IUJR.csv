I already have Sunset Boulevard in my collection, but who cares? I don't mind having two copies of a true classic.",1229644800,,262,3.7818181818181817
7969776,5,B00006IUJR,I found this same box set at Wal-Mart for $5 on the cheap movie rack.  I would take a look there first before buying it here.,1229126400,,125,3.8076923076923075
7969777,5,B00006IUJR,"Billy Wilder died earlier this year at 95 years old, and it was still too soon. A shame that Hollywood left him after ""Buddy Buddy,"" to spend the last twenty years of his life pining for a movie production that never came his way.
These three movies represent Wilder in his heydey at Paramount Pictures, and also his three best with William Holden, who was just at home playing it straight or wisecracking. Sure, I'd like to see ""The Apartment,"" and ""Some Like It Hot"" on this collection, but those were released by United Artists, so those would be released by MGM, not Paramount anyhow.

These three movies really hold their own, even -- or rather, especially -- today. ""Sunset Boulevard"" is one of the darkest of black comedies, and a really disturbing portrait of Hollywood has-been Norma Desmond and Holden as her kept man screenwriter, who's been hired to bring her out of mothballs. Chilling last line: ""I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. deMille.""

""Stalag 17"" is a nice mix of serious war movie interspersed with slapstick humour. Though Holden is great, his supporting cast almost steal the show, especially Sig Ruman as Sergeant Schultz, the camp guard, Otto Preminger as Commandant von Scherbach and Harvey Lembeck and Robert Strauss as the camp cutups, Harry Shapiro and ""The Animal.""

""Sabrina"" is a beautiful portrait of a young Audrey Hepburn, so vivacious and full of wondrous energy. Though she's a bit self-aware in her role, her charm still just carries you away. Holden is in a supporting role here, but Humphrey Bogart comes off as a bit stiff. Really, though, it's Audrey's movie from beginning to end, and the romantic-comedy script by Ernest Lehman and Samuel Taylor has wit and panache.

However, his greatest movie from this era -- ""Ace In the Hole,"" with Kirk Douglas -- is not included.  It wouldn't be until this past summer that this classic would be released in ANY video format, this time on DVD, by Criterion Collection, not Paramount.  Definitely worth checking out to complete your 1950s Wilder/Paramount collection.

I own all three movies separately, but this set is worth laying down your Benjamins in one fell swoop.",1196899200,7,2152,4.879452054794521
7969778,5,B00006IUJR,"The movies chosen to present this trio of Wilder films are all excellent in their own genre. Not only are Sunset Blvd., Stalag 17, and Sabrina ""true classics"",but the extra bonus features
take you inside the set and inside the mind of Billy Wilder. The well spoken narrative on all three films is not only intelligent but enlightening as well. You can really benefit by watching all three films ""as they are"", but then again
WITH the narrative because it is then that you learn how Wilder worked and got the best performances out of his splendid cast of actors.  The astonishing performance of the 50ish Gloria Swanson in Sunset Blvd. is truly
amazing in itself. Of the three THAT one's my personal favorite.
 William Holden fans will be delighted to know that he is in all three movies!! Was there any sweeter girl than Audrey Hepburn (Sabrina)? She wins your heart as does the character in that movie played by Humphrey Bogart whose subtle turn is quite noteworthy.",1179446400,6,967,4.715976331360947
7969779,5,B00006IUJR,"I had the honor of listening to a talk by Billy Wilder and Jack Lemmon for the a presentation of Some Like it Hot.  It was a fun night.  Probably the most touching part was his reflection of Monroe.  He got emotional and simply said ""She should be here""

After that it only increase my liking of his film work.  I was happy to find this set.

Of the three I would have to say Sabrina and Stalog-17 are my favorite.

Sabrina: Is a great film with a powerful cast.  One of the great beauties of the area is Audrey Hepburn and this film and Roman Holiday made her one of my favorties.  She pulls off a great performance especially when working beside Humphrey Bogart and William Holden.  It is a sweet story of the Cinderella like story of a young girl who is in love with the son of her fathers employer.  Her charm simply carries the film.

Stalog-17: The film that served the foundation for Hogan's heros.  This is a classic as William Holden plays self serving loner of a POW camp during WWII.  The rest are trying to escape but every attempt is foild and people die.  Somebody is betraying them.  Is it Holden who never seems to go without favors or special gifts?  The support cast really make the film fly.  Even when it ends you still want more!

Sunset Boulevard:  Is a great story that paints a bad image of Hollywood.  We have Norma Desmond once queen of the cinema now forgotten by Hollywood.  Holden is hired to write her a script to bring her out of ""retirement""  Holden thinks it's a job but it turns out to be much more.  This film led to many uses of the famous line ""I'm ready for my close-up, Mr DeMille""  It's rather scary!  Too bad many people.

A sad thing that many people don't know these films.

I will finish with giving a tribute to Mr. Wilder.

Years ago I was in a theater that shows old films.  I went with my wife to watch Sabrina.  Two women sat behind us and my wife heard one say:

""I saw the new movie they just did.  This film is way more funny then it!""",1137024000,,1987,4.199468085106383
7969780,5,B00006IUJR,"No need to say these are all fine, classic movies,but in response to those who wonder why it doesn't include SOME LIKE IT HOT or THE APARTMENT ... this boxed set is issued by Paramount Pictures. Paramount can't release films made by other studios, so please stop complaining.  :-)
I think it's great to have these three films boxed, especially the little-seen STALAG 17.
SOME LIKE IT HOT and THE APARTMENT are available everywhere, so let's be grateful for what Paramount is giving us: the best movies Wilder made at their studio.",1040947200,8,530,4.760869565217392
