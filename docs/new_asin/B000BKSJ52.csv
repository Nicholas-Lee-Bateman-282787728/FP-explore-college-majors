2422717,4,B000BKSJ52,"First,I would like to clarify that the anime is completely different to the manga.  I suggest to watch this anime as if you've never read the manga.

The series is really interesting overall, but the first 10 to 12 episodes seemed to me like the film makers had little clue as to how they wanted the series to proceed; there's almost no coherence between the episodes.  Even Dark, who's one of the central characters, doesn't get much of the spotlight (or doesn't appear at all for a couple of episodes).

Fortunately, at some point, the series starts to flow smoothly & have coherence; also, it starts to follow a main plot(it's also the point when I started to love the series).  The ending is very good!  For the last episodes I was really hooked.

Overall, the series is entertaining, but a bit childish (a bit different from the manga perspective).  If you're expecting it to be a bit dark like the manga, don't buy it.  Before buying the anime, I suggest to try to rent it or borrow it to see if it really is of your liking.",1142985600,2,1030,4.4361702127659575
2422718,5,B000BKSJ52,"This is so awsome to have all in one complete set. I am a complete manga fan and the biggest fan of D.N.Angel. If you like romance fantasy and action then this is the anime for you.

2422719,5,B000BKSJ52,"I bought this box set today & it does have the Japanese audio(2.0) beside English dubbed audio(5.1) Stephan! So its different from what you expected! About the product,5DVDs each in a thin DVD case contain all 26episodes & all packed in a box set. The only thing this set lacks is having any extra stuffs! Thats cuz they compressed 7DVDs to 5DVDs! lol

The Anime itself doesn't need any explanation the Manga was 1 of the best sellers ever!

So go ahead & enjoy",1134259200,16,461,4.476190476190476
2422720,5,B000BKSJ52,"I just called Advfilms and they told me that this complete collection of DNAngel does have original Japanese Audio with english subtitles, it's so great:)
DNAngel is one of the best animes, the story, songs, music, art and design are so great, I totally love this anime:)
My favorite songs of it are True light and Caged bird, so touching, so beautiful.
DNAngel, I would rate it million stars if there could have!!:)

P.S. The complete collection does NOT have the extras on the Discs, if you like the songs and features, you might have to purchase the individual DVDs.",1129507200,35,569,4.69
2422721,1,B000BKSJ52,"Ok thats like the most stupidest thing to do! release all of DNAngel complete boxset in DUBBED format only? what about the subbed format for those of us that prefer the original Japanese audio? This is a very stupid move on ADV's part to not release the boxset in dual audio -_- i can honestly say that THIS boxset won't be on my ""to buy"" list thanks alot ADV for making a very stupid mistake",1128038400,9,392,4.24
2422742,5,B000BKSJ52,"I was very impressed. Even though it did not come in a box, each DVD case (which in fact had artwork on back and front) was wrapped in a plastic shield which I'm going to use to keep fingerprints off the cases.

I've been a fan of the DN Angel anime for quite sometime now. I first saw it on YouTube but I wanted to own it, so I bought this set. Every episode is in a stunning resolution. The Japanese voice acting is phenomenal (I wouldn't recommend the English Dub).",1265155200,,468,4.142857142857143
2422743,5,B000BKSJ52,I have watched this show over and over. It's definitely not my favorite anime and it's no masterpiece but it's a lot of fun. The plot's interesting the characters are loveable. It's one of those shows you can watch over and over. The music is great you'll probably be listening to the soundtrack for a long time. Like me! If you're looking for light hearted fun I would highly recommend this.,1250294400,,392,4.535211267605634
2422744,5,B000BKSJ52,"This collection is great, it comes in english, and japanese audio (w/ english subs) it includes every episode, easy menu options, the cover art is great, including the ones in each of the 4 discs. The images are nice and clear, you can skip the intro and ending unlike most jap. imports that don't and have to fast forward, but it really is great and i recommend it for any DN Angel fan!",1222992000,,387,4.315068493150685
2422745,5,B000BKSJ52,It was wonderful. Great quality and sound. The seller was great to work with. He let me know what was going on the whole time. I would recomend him to all!,1222646400,,155,4.032258064516129
2422746,5,B000BKSJ52,"I love this show for its witty, unique style of comedy.  The cat burgler style of the bulk of episodes is unique and fun.  Dark gets involved in a lot of heists that seem to always spell extra trouble.  The supporting cast is well fleshed and fun as well.

The overall love story aspect is wonderfully written and I for one was very happy to see the two 'true lovers' end up together.  Packs a lot of nightime heist action with some supernatural elements and a lot of fun.

Pros: Fun, funny, interesting, great characters
Cons: Cartoony at times, can be cheesy

Viewing preference: Japanese with English subtitles",1206230400,,613,4.62037037037037
2422747,5,B000BKSJ52,"I would love to be able to give a detailed discription about this collection. What it is about, why it's great, why it's not, and why everyone should give it a try but I'm way to lazy to do all that.

I first saw this on my computer at YouTube. I wasn't really sure what to think. He transforms into another person. It's not like he gets powers it's more like a possession of sorts. In a good way. Anyway, the DVD collection is something like $80 dollars and it took forever for me to say screw it. I bought it and have watched it twice. It can be a little hard to follow and they don't explain a few things but overall I still give it a 5. I think the episodes are fun and the last two discs are really good. I also really really LOVE the music. I would love to have all the CD's but I can't find them anywhere.",1190937600,,812,3.951219512195122
2422748,4,B000BKSJ52,"I've only read a little of the manga, but I was far more intrigued by the anime. The anime is very good and it has a wonderful ending. The characters are deep and intriguing. The action kept me on the edge of my seat. But I'm a romantic at heart and there was plenty of human drama and sweetness, and enough comedy to balance out the heavy plot.

I watched it in both English and Japanese. Daisuke and Satoshi I liked both in English and Japanese, but Dark I actually preferred in English. Risa I absolutely couldn't stand in English. Riku was fine in English, but I liked her better in Japanese. All the other characters were fine in either language.

The only thing I didn't like about it was the inconsistency of the plot pacing. It seems to drag out for a long time with all the thefts, but when we get to the end, it just rushes into a conclusion. But is an overall good purchase. The DVDs themselves lack only the commentary from the English cast that were on previous DVDs.

D.N.Angel gets an excellent review from me and I'll end up watching it for quite awhile.",1182470400,,1070,4.34
2422749,4,B000BKSJ52,"Now then let me first say that I've been a big fan of D. N. Angle since the manga was first previewed in new type four or five years ago. Add to this is that I've pretty much engraved every manga to come out into me perminately memory. I rented this series because I wanted to know how everything ended.

D. N. Angle is a good series, no doubt but I'm having trouble reviewing this one objectively for a few reasons. One is I just can't help but compare the manga version to the anime version. Two is the differences annoy and infuriate me.

Well lets start off the review with the englich voice acting which is good not great, I've heard better but it's descent. Two is animation, which is kind of odd, it his smooth but not fluid. This is probably because of the way it was directed with the camera constantly changing direction and refocusing of things, zooming in and out. Character designs are okay most are shallow but still somewhat likable. The music with all honesty was pretty good, not the best I've heard but still pretty good. The plot has quite a few twists that will keep you guessing. The ending felt rushed and lacking leaving you thinking wait that's it?

Now as you have probably noticed I personally did not really like this show. Mostly because of the huge difference in the anime and manga. This is a review for everyone that's read the manga like me and are thinking about buying this one. First the focus' are completely different. The anime mainly focus' on Daisake being the phantom thief and pretty much breezes over everything else, mean most of the first half of the series is just him doing jobs. The relationships which are the focus of the manga don't really start until about half way threw and then at a snails pace. In the manga Risa is betrayed as a brave and devoted girl that though selfish does care about Riku, other then that a normal girl. In the anime Risa is betrayed as more of a selfish, flake leaving you wondering what Daisake saw in her. Also in the manga Satoshi and Daisake are rather close even stated that Satoshi feelings of friendship towards Daisake are what causes him to transform. Another huge difference is that in the manga Daisake's feelings for Risa are kinda glossed over where as his relationship with Riku though romantic is like a wine that gets richer with time. In fact the last manga to come out had him wanting to save Risa from her situation not so much for his own feelings for her but because of the suffering it caused Riku. In the anime it's the reverse Daisake spends most of his time crushing on Risa and ignoring Riku all together. Another difference is that in the manga Dark is a far more tragic character, being able to love but never truly being able to be loved in return and eventually losing his love to his best friend, the one he's possessing then disappearing never to see them again. Also Dark's and Daisake's relationhip is far different in the two versions. In the manga Daisake and Dark are rather good friends with most of the comedy stemming from the two jeering each other or trying to keep their secret when they keep transforming at awkward times. The two act more like brothers then anything. Another jarring difference in the versions is in the manga Daisake's klutziness is an act which Riku notices, he actually is quite agile and graceful as well as sensitive where as in the anime he's a complete klutz/bonehead. Also Daisake's dad is the resident art/legend know it all and shows up a lot more and generally is more of the help.

Any way when everything's said and done I suggest you rent this one. If you can go get the manga it's much better, is unending at this point.",1172534400,10,3676,4.490284005979073
2422750,5,B000BKSJ52,"Very good Anime, the plot and storyline kept me wanting to see more of each epiode I probably watched each one more than three times each.",1168128000,,138,4.346153846153846
2422761,4,B000BKSJ52,"I bought this package two weeks ago and then found the same package at Best Buy for $59 ... not a sale special, just Best Buy's regular price.

2422763,4,B000BKSJ52,"This is such a great anime!!!Beautiful music,art,story. Only reason I took a star off is because I prefer the Japanese audio to the English audio.

2422764,4,B000BKSJ52,"It was an interesting series to say the least. when i started it i figured it would be full of action with a good amount of drama thrown in the mix... after about 3 episodes of no action you realize that this becomes a dramatic love story with many twists.  Its a ""cute"" series with a cast that you just come to love...",1154044800,,319,4.063492063492063
2422765,5,B000BKSJ52,"I haven't bought the DVD collection yet, so I can't say much for the DVD itself, but I have seen the anime. The first 10 or so episodes struck me as very random, and unconnecting. It's very different from the manga, in which the plot is fairly obvious from the beginning. But besides this, I have no complaints. The animation is very smooth, and it's easy to see what going on, even in scenes with a lot of action (like the fights between Krad and Dark). It really isn't a ""kid's"" anime, since there are some... misunderstandings *cough*, and a bit of swearing (nothing you won't hear in a public school, but it's still there XD). Overall, entertaining and interesting to watch (a lot of the comedy is laugh out loud funny), if a somewhat bittersweet ending.

If you enjoy the anime, definitely pick up the manga (there are 10 volumes published in English so far, with the 11th on the way).",1151366400,3,890,4.493827160493828
2422766,4,B000BKSJ52,"I borrowed this anime from a friend, and while I enjoyed it, I would not spend $80+ on something I could pick up at Best Buy for $50.",1150502400,3,133,3.7857142857142856
2422767,5,B000BKSJ52,This series was amazing! When my order arrived I planned to watch 2 episodes a month but it was such a great show that I watched it in three days. On my list of favorites shows D.N. Angel and Inuyasha were #1. The books are a little different but it stills ends the same. It's also a romatic comedy but when it begins to end you will feel like you should have taken it a bit more seriously.,1150416000,,390,4.012820512820513
2422768,5,B000BKSJ52,"I am 17 yrs old, and I think that D.N. Angel was one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. It kept me captured throughout the entire series, and I was not dissapointed when I finally reached the end. This is a fantastic series for anyone between the ages of 12 and 18.",1149379200,,274,3.9107142857142856
2422769,5,B000BKSJ52,"D.N. Angel is the only anime series I like.  It's funny, romantic, silly, sad, depressing, and awesome all in one 26 episode series.  It's a little different from the manga though because some events happen and others don't.  There are even some that are just plain out from the anime.  Also some characters are different.  Wiz from the manga is With, and To-To is just Toha.

This anime/manga with grab you from the first heart breaking then thriller episode to the last super sad yet happy-romantic episode.  It's something you won't want to miss.",1148515200,,549,4.776595744680851
2422770,5,B000BKSJ52,"I was like a lot of you. I read the first three volumes of the manga and was intrigued on how the anime was. I read other reviews online about this box set and most said they were not disappointed. This product was very satisfactory. You can watch it in Japanese or english.

8088022,4,B000BKSJ52,"The box set looks gorgeous on shelving with all the other anime. I'm going to give this a 4 star out of 5, simply because I first watched this when I was younger and thought the love was more intense in this anime as a child, then what it really was watching it as I was more mature and able to understand things more clearly. Though there is a love mix in this anime...its really focused on the Dark and the tale behind who he is and what he does/how he is perceived in society. The boy who winds up being dark this time around is a loving character and you fall in love with the characters very quickly. There is a bit of drama such as dark liking the girl that the other boy likes...but its very entertaining. I would buy it again. Only counting a star off because it lacked the nostalgia from what I remembered as a child..though that's not to say that this a very good anime.",1379376000,,880,4.152046783625731
8088023,5,B000BKSJ52,"I bought this as a present for my younger sister, who had just recently gotten into anime.

8088024,5,B000BKSJ52,This series is very entertaining.  it contains happy and sad moments that keep the story going.  You will find yourself guessing at what happens next...,1356998400,,152,5.04
8088025,4,B000BKSJ52,"Daisuke Niwa is 14 years old. He is the next Phantom Dark. Each generation of Niwa males shares their body with the legendary thief, Phantom Dark. Phantom Dark is frowned upon by society as a common criminal. The public doesn't know that he actually steals cursed artwork and artifacts. The young Daisuke has a crush on Risa Harada. Risa only has eyes for the Phantom thief. The one who actually loves Daisuke is the older Harada twin, Riku. Now this dilemma seems simple to me. Tell them both that you are Niwa as well as Phantom Dark. Or just choose the sister you like and be with her. Personally, I think that Risa is a bit shallow and clueless. I would definitely go for the more sincere Riku. I'll let you watch and find out who the winner is. Anyway, for the bond between Dark and Daisuke to be broken, and their duty fulfilled 2 things must happen: 1. Daisuke must steal his sacred maiden, and 2. Dark must defeat his rival, Krad. The drama and action is very good. This series is very solid.

D.N. Angel is a really good show. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are very good. You'll recognize the main characters. Vic Mignogna, Luci Christian, and Hilary Haag all play the major characters. There is a good mix of action, drama, romance, and comedy in this series. There are times when it seems to drag, and get into some unimportant story arcs. I think that the potential for this anime was higher than it actually achieved. If the useless arcs were used for relationship and character development, it could have reached its true potential and became a 5 star series. Because of those things, it was a solid 4 star series. I don't want to make it sound like this series was disappointing. It didn't disappoint. It was very good, and I'm glad I bought it. It's definitely a show that I'll revisit in the future. By no means is it one of the best anime series out there though.

It does have another strong point that separates it from many other shows. While many anime series out there today are quite perverted and geared toward males. This is a very clean and wholesome show. The characters have very sweet and pure personalities. There isn't really any fan service; unless you count the beach trip episode. The language is very mild. These things are kind of nice to see in an anime. Boobs, perverts, and Yuri are very overdone themes in anime nowadays. Although I get a kick outta that stuff once in a while, it's not essential to a strong series. I like that D.N. Angel kept it clean. It's one that you can share with the whole family. It will even teach younger kids a few important lessons about love, friendship, and family.

I apologize for rambling a bit. I had a lot to say about this show. In conclusion I recommend this series to all anime fans over the age of 8 or so. It's not the best series out there, but it's very solid and has some cute and innocent love and drama. I really enjoyed D.N. Angel and I hope you do too.",1356220800,,2956,4.440147329650092
8088026,5,B000BKSJ52,"I encourage any potential fans to read the manga, as I think it's better and more interesting. However, I also love this anime. It has weird moments where something may be awkward or not make sense, but all in all I love it. I love Daisuke and Dark, and they make the anime worth watching. I recommend this anime to fans of action and intrigue.",1355097600,,344,4.3076923076923075
8088027,5,B000BKSJ52,The D.V.D complete set of D.N.Angel was in excellent quality. There were no distortions or skippings in any of the disks. I very much enjoyed watching it. It came in excellent condition when it arrived.,1299801600,,202,4.8
