2892280,3,B000T28PV0,"This film by Robert Budreau had tremendous opportunity and with Roy Dupuis and Gordon Tootoosis, it should have been a Genie contender hands down. Unfortunately, the pace of the movie was slow and the plot was disjointed. I didn't hate it, but I was disappointed.  I think Roy can always sell a character but the chemistry didn't seem to be there with Jane. I thought about it for a while afterward and instead of a romantic chemistry, it seemed to be more of a ""parental"" type interest and concern. Which is okay considering the story being told about the bog. I felt that Jane's character was supposed to be likeable and you are supposed to identify with her, but I just didn't feel it. Again, it may just be because the story seemed to be missing vital parts.  I think if you are a Roy Dupuis fan you should check it out, but be prepared that it is not ""The Rocket"" or ""Memoire Affective.""  It is a nice character study with Roy playing the lead and it might have been even better if it had just been him... Just my opinion and we all have one! :)",1191110400,18,1050,4.319796954314721
2892281,4,B000T28PV0,"(Ok, that's actually a quote from Terry Pratchett, but it's apt.)

For anyone looking for one of those edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting-excitement suspense/mystery blockbusters, this won't be your cup of tea. It is paced slowly, contemplatively, so that the viewer can absorb of the implications of the story as the drama unfolds. It's a murder mystery, yes, but it goes where few in this genre are willing to go - to search out the very marrow of death and its significance.

Roy Dupuis delivers a characteristically excellent and nuanced performance as a detective, struggling with his own demons whilst attempting to solve a 150-year-old murder. Jane McGregor is adequate in her role as the archaeologist brought on to the case who has a secret of her own.

It's a thoughtful, careful movie, beautifully filmed. Particularly gratifying is the use of doubling (ok, this isn't a technical term, but then, I'm not a film scholar, just an enthusiast). Robert Budreau excellently parallels the personal struggles of his protagonists by seamlessly shifting the story lines with visual cues.

The only flaw I found was that the soundtrack was at times overwrought, overpowering the performance of the actors. A good soundtrack should underscore, not overwhelm, the action on screen.

Overall, a very good, intellectually-stimulating film with the perfect amount of dramatic tension to keep story line flowing.",1191024000,49,1403,5.301801801801802
2892337,2,B000T28PV0,"I had high hopes for this movie - one of the best Canadian Frech working actors around (Roy Dupuis), interesting story line involving bog bodies and native american indians, incredible scenery of Northern Canada. Unfortunately none of it came together for me.  I didn't really care about the female lead and her ""mysterious illness"" which turns out to be not so mysterious, the scenes with the native american indians are cheesy and overly dramatic, the storyline was jerky and implausible.

On the good side, I liked how the story of the two leads, the young female scientist and the older jaded poiice detective and their personal tragedies wove together - if they had only focused on that - but alas - someone had the great idea to try to make this a love story and here is where the movie goes horribly awry.  I was wondering where the relationship was going and when it finally got to their embrace I wanted to scream out ""NOOOOOOO"" and cover the screen - it just felt so not right and forced.

Roy as usual gives a touching and nuanced performance - his counterpart in the female lead just cannot come close to meeting his talent.  If they had only reshot the film and left the romance parts on the cutting room floor this movie might have gone somewhere - or perhaps with a different lead actress who could be more sympathetic in the role - as it was I didn't give a hoot about her illness and wanted her scenes to end more quickly so we could get back to the really interesting story line of the detective struggling with a huge personal decision of his own.

Recommended for Roy Dupuis fans as you will not be dispointed in his performance - but the rest of it left me lukewarm at best.",1344729600,2,1695,4.46925566343042

2892339,4,B000T28PV0,A story that could have been so much better if the lead actress could act. Sorry but that took away from an intense story line. Way to immature for that part. Roy immerses himself in this role and as always can pull out feelings without one word being spoken.  Predictable ending of course. Beautiful scenery. Worth watching if you are Roy Dupuis fan.,1286755200,2,351,4.571428571428571

2892343,3,B000T28PV0,"A haunting tale of tormented characters plagued by their pasts and the secrets consuming them, That Beautiful Somewhere follows two troubled souls struggling to find meaning with their lives and a way to heal their physical and mental pain. While the film expertly dissects the two leads and their minds and motives, it unfortunately takes its time to delve into the complex character development and often lingers on every moment, no matter its degree of poignancy, creating a cumbersome pacing that may be too slow for today's less-than-patient moviegoer.

Detective Conk Adams (Roy Dupuis) is assigned to help young archaeologist Catherine Nyland (Jane McGregor) discover the identity and cause of death of a mummified body found in a local bog in the snowy depths of Canada. At first he disregards the scientist's notions of the bog's curative powers and the supposed murder, but soon grows to value and appreciate the time he spends with her. After running several tests on the corpse, Catherine slowly begins to uncover its identity and searches for the truth behind the myths of the Native American healing ritual that may have lead to its death. Wishing to use the healing powers of the bog herself, she and Conk track down a reclusive Indian who holds the final clues to the body's identity as well as the shocking path that both tortured souls will eventually travel.

Beautifully shot exteriors and snowy forested scenery almost make up for the dragging pace the film chooses to adopt. While the presentation is top notch, the film crawls at times and makes several attempts to go somewhere beautiful, and then doesn't. In the quest to understand life, death, love, and sacrifice, the two characters build to the drastic conclusion with great detail and concern, but the philosophies of the Native American healing ritual hold little weight with the reasoning behind the characters' decisions.

Roy Dupuis portrays the haunted detective with mature finesse and a gruff disposition, creating a performance as convincing as it is compelling. Jane McGregor plays off the troubled soul with an equally tormented character but doesn't quite capture the intensity of the disturbed detective. While revealing the beliefs surrounding an ancient ritual, the ideals and sacrifices required betray a certain believability which is difficult to accept, though the characters are at an edge of desperation that can only be quelled by the dire tasks placed before them.

A flawed yet noble exploration of the human condition, That Beautiful Somewhere reveals bits of truly stunning emotion, yet its deliberate pacing may offset those unable to wait for its deeply moving ending that offers a compelling look into the lengths some will go for forgiveness and redemption.

2892345,4,B000T28PV0,"Watching this movie is like reading a spiritual book, momentarily encountering a different realm, that beautiful somewhere.
This movie, in its own way, opens a door to what a challenge's message might be. It demonstrates the courage it invites you to go to that somewhere and the bravery that is inevitable and yet optional.
The acting is good and when in the special features you see Roy Dupuis and listen to him,you know right away that he was so right for this role.
The only flaw was the director's lack of education on migraine or most illnesses for that matter. Fast running makes migraine pain worse , so does listening to loud music with headphones while running.
This movie might seem sad and slow but in the end it is uplifting, it has a beautiful message and if you feel it, it touches you and it takes you to that beautiful somewhere.",1196467200,4,846,4.572368421052632
2892346,5,B000T28PV0,"I came across this film by accident and had no reviews or synopsis to tell me what this film whas about. All i knew was that roy Dupuis was the lead actor and since I had enjoyed his work on La Femme Nikita I decided to take a chance.
 Unlike Dupuis stoic charactor "" Michael "" on LFN, in this film his role of Dect. Conk Adams willingly expresses his emotions.
 Hereis a story of two fragile people drawn together on a murder case that soon becomes something else entirely and they become close. Not really lovers but more than friends and share an emotional bond.
 The ending came as a total surprise, so simple it should have been expected but you are so involved in what is happening you don't even think of what is to come until it happens.
 There is no real "" Happy Ever After "" here only a bittersweet release. Dupuis gives an excellent performance and this film is truely deserving of a look.",1193616000,29,900,4.3076923076923075

8207297,2,B000T28PV0,"SPOILERS...SPOILERS...SPOILERS. I had seen Roy Dupuis in Emotional Arithmetic (highly recommend) and decided to see more of his work.  Great acting on his part but the idea of a Native American ceremony requiring sacrifice just did not ring true to me.  How can the death of one person be a healing event for another.?  (No matter how much that person might need healing.)  I have never heard of a Native ceremony requiring suicide but maybe someone can enlighten me on that point.  Another film, equally infuriating, is BREAKING THE WAVES with Stellan Skarsgaard. It has this same theme.  (Again spoilers).  Stellan's character is healed of complete body paralysis when his wife sacrifices herself through a brutal rape and beating unto death in order to heal him.  And the church bells ring!  Just unbelievable.  Where did this idea come from?  It makes no sense from any healing paradigm that I know of which always celebrates LIFE not death.",1421798400,,945,4.955414012738854
8207298,3,B000T28PV0,"Roy Dupuis is a wonderful actor, I thoroughly enjoyed him in the five seasons of the La Femme Nikita series! He's awesome. But this movie...I wasn't excited about. Mostly, I could not connect with the female lead. Her acting was simply not up to the level that Roy's is. She was not bad, but at no time did she draw me in to her character. I actually felt annoyed by her lack of acting ability & thought a more mature woman & actress would've been a better fit for him & would have made the story better. There was no chemistry between them either. I had a hard time finishing the movie because the pace of the story was just too slow. If it wasn't for Mr. Dupuis I wouldn't even have bothered. The storyline itself was ok but I'm sure I won't watch this again.",1418774400,2,761,4.219178082191781

8207302,3,B000T28PV0,"That Beautiful Somewhere"" is a Canadian film from 2006, shot in North Bay and Temagami, Ontario. It's part mystery and part love story. I don't mean ""mystery"" in the conventional sense, but in the sense that the film has a mysterious ambiance and there's a mysterious death, albeit from the distant past. The plot revolves around some remains found in a marsh with supposed healing powers, the archaeologist and cop assigned to the case, and some Native Americans.

The reason I bought the DVD is because the cover makes it look like a film I'd like. I do like it, but not enough to give it anything more than a 6/10 rating. The locations, cinematography, acting and overall atmosphere of the film are top-rate, but certain factors in the story pull down my rating. The biggest being the ending and its sudden surprise; it destroys what was building up to that point.

I guess if you reflect on it, though, it all makes sense and there's some spiritual typology.

What I like most is the film's mysterious and beautiful aura. There's a palpable reverence. Plus I enjoy seeing this remote part of Canada. But the story -- while okay -- isn't all that compelling and the ending does it in.

Still, it's not bad. It's worthwhile if you like this type of fare.",1364342400,2,1256,4.618834080717488
