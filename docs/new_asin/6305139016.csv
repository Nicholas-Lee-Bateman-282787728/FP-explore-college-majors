8265049,2,6305139016,"The Cat in the Hat (the book) is a favorite of mine and my daughters (2 and 4). I love the rhythm and rhymes. I was disappointed with this animated version because it retains very little of the language from the book. In  contrast, the animated versions of the Grinch Who Stole Christmas, Horton  Hears a Who, and Green Eggs and Ham stay very close to the language of the  books, only elaborating and tinkering slightly with the language here and  there (and adding clever songs). The Cat in the Hat animated version,  however, totally re-writes the whole story. Yes, it is cute, and wacky, and  my kids like to watch it. But I see no reason for it to have departed so  far from the book. The book is a classic and its language is perfect. Why  change it?",952992000,2,755,4.3428571428571425
8265050,5,6305139016,This video is excellent for children of all ages. I enjoyed it as achild and I find myself referring back for the basics. The Cat in the Hat is a role model for everyone.,952128000,,170,4.029411764705882
8265051,4,6305139016,"I love this video! Although primarily aimed at kids, like all the good material from this genre, it has something for the parents too. The songs stick in your head for days after, and although the kids in the show are  somewhat bland, the Cat, Mr. Krinklebine (the goldfish) and Thing 2 and  Thing 1 more than make up for it. My kids have to watch these at least once  a day and love every minute of it. I also recommend the Green Eggs and Ham  video.",949881600,3,451,4.149425287356322
