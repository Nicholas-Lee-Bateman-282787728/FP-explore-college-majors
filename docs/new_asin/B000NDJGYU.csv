8177298,3,B000NDJGYU,"Duke Ellington was a Five Star Genius.

I give this historically inaccurate and misleading production 3 stars.

For those who take things literally and don't know much about the history OR about Duke Ellington...

This video starts out immediately wrong.  Jazz came up from New Orleans into Chicago and New York.  Every bit of history shows this to be fact.  So, the video starts off talking about how jazz was ""invented in Harlem"".  This isn't true.  Duke Ellington doesn't need inaccuracies in his history, Duke wrote his own history.

When talking about Harlem, immediately the talk goes into socio-ethnic diatribe which eliminates the true origin of this uniquely American art form.  This too is misleading and inaccurate.  Duke Ellington was there in the mid 20's.  Plenty of musicians had recorded ""jazz"" years before!  Good Grief!  Duke would have told a different story than the story propped up in this video regarding where the music came from.  Duke had no agenda.

The first HOUR of the video talks about Ellington's writing genius (and, it's TRUE) but among the first song or two you hear is BILLY STRAYHORN's ""Take the A Train"".  Oddly enough, the is NO significant mention of Billy Strayhorn but plenty of his music is heard as the story keeps talking about Duke Ellington being a genius composer.  This is insane, Duke would have told anyone that Billy Strayhorn more or less rescued Duke as he was floundering (after the death of his/Duke's mother).  My goodness, what total bunk in the first hour of this video.

Oddly enough, there is mention made (and this topic isn't in the usual fluffy stuff written about Ellington) of Johnny Hodges being involved with the creation of some of Duke Ellington's music.  This was certainly the case and of course, is the nature of jazz in that people are/were influenced by others.

Duke Ellington would not be pleased with how the first hour of this ""Celebration"" played out with regard to historical inaccuracies and omissions (STRAYHORN!).  Wow.

Look, it's great to see and hear these great musicians talk and celebrate Duke... but the storyline as PRODUCED by the people who put this thing together is quite misleading, inaccurate and was possibly intended to be.  Ken Burns was more accurate than the first hour of this DVD.

The good news - it exists.",1373500800,2,2313,4.881748071979435

8177300,5,B000NDJGYU,I've wanted A DUKE NAMED ELLINGTON to be released since it was broadcast (in two parts) on PBS in the 1980s. It contains wonderful tv and film footage from six decades of Duke's career. An exquisite film.,1193443200,13,204,4.54054054054054
