There is also a very interesting film of candid footage of the filming process.  Recommended if you love Buster.",1359158400,,252,4.790697674418604
7865765,4,6304239386,"The Railrodder and Buster Keaton Rides Again (1965) are enjoyable remnants of the Keaton revival that occurred in the late '50s and early '60s, just before Keaton's death in 1966. The National Film Board of Canada paid tribute to Keaton by having him do a short subject in his old silent style.
The Railrodder depicts an older version of Buster's famous persona, porkpie hat and all, reading a newspaper article about increased Canadian travel and deciding he wants to join the crowd. He does this by accidentally starting up an electric railroad car that takes him across the country whether he wants to go or not. Buster, as always, resigns himself to greater forces and decides to enjoy the scenery. This short is amusing enough, but by Keaton's standards, the gags aren't very elaborate (probably owing to having to taking it easy on the advanced-aged Keaton). It's best seen as a novelty in which Keaton is allowed to perform an entire sound short in his old silent style.
Of far greater interest is Buster Keaton Rides Again, a black-and-white documentary about the making of The Railrodder. The documentary shows Keaton the creative filmmaker who, even in his late seventies, is willing to tussle with his director in order to milk every possible laugh out of a gag. Of special note is a scene of Keaton arguing with Railrodder director John Spotton about a shot of Keaton and his car rolling over an extremely tall bridge which, if Keaton wasn't careful, would cause him to plunge to his death. Keaton's arguing with his wife Eleanor and with Spotton about this dangerous gag, which occupies but a few seconds of screen time, shows  just how seriously Keaton took his filmmaking, even when his once-agile body was rapidly failing.
The Railrodder and Buster Keaton Rides Again are worthy additions to anyone's Keaton library.",1009411200,5,1832,4.909677419354839
7865766,5,6304239386,"Here is the person of Buster Keaon.  Nothing less than a genius of comedy.  This combines a very funny short movie and the making of it as well.  Keaton suggests, often demands how a scene will be done and we see just why he brought tears of laughter to Americans for decades.
For a rail buff, it's very enjoyable.  They are using real equipment on real right-of-ways of Canadian National.  From the east coast to the west coast with many picturesque and many dismal backgrounds, but each the perfect backdrop to the comedy unfolding.
Mr. Keaton died soon after this film was made, but his gift to us will be here anytime that little kid in us stands by a railroad track or watches this video and dreams.

7865767,5,6304239386,"Film #1 of this video is ""The Railrodder"" (1965) by the National Film Board of Canada.  ""The Railrodder"" is much like what Buster would have made before the year 1923: A 20-minute silent short with musical  score and a string of impossible gags.  Buster's character opens the film  in London reading a newspaper ad which says ""See Canada Now"".  He  literally does by jumping off a London bridge into the Thames and swimming  the Atlantic, ending up on the east shore of Canada.  He steals a railroad  handcar and drives it through Canada, ending the film on the west coast.  ""The Railrodder"" is more purposeful as a travelogue for Canadian  tourism than as a Keaton comedy short.  Its comedic style would be more at  home in the 1920's than in 1965.
Film #2 is one of the most interesting  films of Buster's post-silent career.  ""Buster Keaton Rides  Again"" is a down-to-earth black and white documentary about the making  of ""The Railrodder"".  The camera picks up on the fact that you  know Buster is having a good time making this film and the director, Gerald  Potterton, knows enough that Buster is one of the greatest directors the  cinema's ever had to let him take over the reins and supervise some of the  scenes.
One scene shows Buster annoyed and tense, and makes the viewer  feel disturbed about a troubled filmmaking situation, then he throws us an  about-face and mutters an unrelated, dry one-liner about a never-ending  train passing by that has an excessive number of cars.  But the troubled  situation continues as Buster is shown being stubborn and ornery about one  of his gags being replaced by another because it was thought to be too  dangerous (""that is not dangerous, that's child's-play, for the love  of Mike!"").
Other scenes show Buster playing a serious game of  bridge....having fun by yelling at a baseball game on TV (that has horrible  ""snowstorm"" reception) because one player made a flunky  move....his wife Eleanor, a no-nonsense, good-common-sense kinda gal,  explaining how she prevents him from getting physically ill with the  medication she carries...and looking uncomfortable but being polite at a  Manitoba social event.
Interspersed is narration that describes the  events of his life.  Sometimes it's irritating.  Made me wince. Instead of  just giving us the facts, it throws in a fake, dramatic monologue that was  a popular style in 60's documentaries. However, it includes an excellent  series of photos of Buster's childhood that make the viewer realize that  Buster was expected to act and dress like a full-fledged adult on and off  the stage starting at age 4.
A lot of cigarette smoking with related  coughing fits are shown.  The consumption of a lifetime of inhaling these  things caused his death at 70, which was 1 1/2 years after this documentary  was made.",958953600,14,2815,4.914529914529915
