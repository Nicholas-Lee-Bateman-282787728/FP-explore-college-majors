5115906,5,B0080JX4Y2,"Being a Casper Andreas fan I heard about this movie and novel through him. I quickly purchased the book and fell in love. I couldn't wait to see the movie. When I saw that it was finally on Amazon I bought it right away.
I could not have thought of a better cast. Allison was hilarious as Candy. Her scene with her ""slave"" was hilarious. Matthew was perfect as Adam. I couldn't have wished for anyone else to play that character. Michael was dreamy as John. I could see how anyone could be completely head over heals for that man. Casper was heartbreaking as Nick. The scene in the warehouse was hard to watch. That was exactly how I imagined it when reading the book.
I don't want to write too much, because I am sure I will give the movie away. Lets just say that being a reader of the book I LOVED the twist Casper gave us.
Amazing job to everyone involved in this movie!!!!",1339891200,6,877,4.25748502994012

5115911,3,B0080JX4Y2,"Great trashy fun.  An incisive look at an ambitious young actor, arriving in LA with big dreams and a short wallet.  Desperate to make money, he starts working as a stock boy for a porn company in the Valley, home to America's leading porn studios.  Soon enough, he's posing for nude photos and doing his first video.  His sudden notoriety leads to escort work, where he meets a famous TV actor.  Needless to say, the star lives deeply in the closet, but soon enough their assignation becomes a genuine affair.  To say more would ruin the slender plot, but the actors are appealing and engaging even when the story tries to portray the seamy side of the gay porn biz.

5115913,4,B0080JX4Y2,I like the movie.  A nice romantic comedy. I thought Adam's character was typical for his age and at the same time sorta savvy about the life. His expressions were occasionally stiff but overall he did a good job.  I have.as many of us probably have.known someone like the female lead character. She played the role so well it made me shudder. I also liked Nick.  Good character and good acting. Kudos for his script and direction. Michael Medico's acting is also very believable. The warmth of his smile also shows in his eyes.  This movie is much better most in this genre. I hope there's a sequel.,1447545600,3,600,4.527777777777778

5115917,5,B0080JX4Y2,"Plot: A fresh face comes to Hollywood to act in movies but only the gay porn studios are eager to provide him with work.

Really true to the way LA people act. I have personal experience with the subject as I was a teenager who hung out on Santa Monica Blvd. In Hollywood circa 1978. I fell in love with Matthew Ludwinski (Adam) the moment I first laid eyes on him. AND it only gets better when he starts to take his clothes off. His body is SO MY TYPE! This is one ""MUST"" own DVD's.

The flick was funny, sad, and interesting. Kind of a Cinderella ending, but that was okay with me.

5115940,5,B0080JX4Y2,"Going Down in La La Land was hard for me to watch because it is so realistic.  Recently one of my former students went out to LA so full of talent and promise and was promptly seduced into the porn industry.  Less than a year later, that industry had chewed him up and spit him out like a used piece of gum.  That is the story this film addresses. Two young men in LA: one survives the porn industry and one doesnt.
  The script is good and the production values are top notch.  Ludwinski is delightful eye candy and does a good job with his role.  The rest of the cast, including the director, who also shows up in front of the camera, do solid work.  Judy Tenuta is a devilish delight in her cameo role.
Good laughs, good drama, good ending, good film!",1387324800,,754,4.1875
5115941,5,B0080JX4Y2,"I was doubtful when I ordered this film.  There are so many gay themed films that are sadly just not very well done.  When I saw this one I was very pleasantly surprised.  The script was compelling and the actors were all first rate.  It was nice to see production values that although not major studio funded, made great use of the budget they had.  No shoddy camera work and good clear sound.  Casper Andreas is  film maker that just gets better with each film.  I hope the major studios are taking note and that someday he will be able to make movies for them.  Its gratifying to see that there are film makers like Casper Andreas and Matt Riddlehoover who are finding ways to make movie that present gay stories that are well done with interesting points of view.  Its great that we don't have to wait for 5 or 10 years for a brave studio and a ""truly talented risk taking actor"" to find a well made GLBT movie.",1387065600,,915,4.298245614035087
5115942,5,B0080JX4Y2,"Excellent filmaking!

I've being a fan of Casper Andreas' films from the start, but in my opinion ""Going Down in La-La-Land"" is his best work so far. Very good writing, excellent performances (including Andreas himself) and brilliant production values make the movie shine like if it was produced by any major Hollywood studio.

The usual closeted hollywood star who's afraid of coming out (no need to say names, we all know them) the young man arriving to L.A. with lots of dreams and expectations going down... (like the title said) but 'for a change' with an awesomely uplifting ending.

In this case, our hero Adam, doesn't indulge, though his brief encounter with the porn industry, does have its humorus misadventures.
I am glad that Casper gave this film a happy ending. His Between Love and Goodbye, is dark, and a bit of a downer, even if some people's lives (gay or straight) turn out, not so good.
I would recommend this film to those who would want something between comedy and drama (light and dark).  I enjoyed it.  I've made it part of my growing gay themed or story telling (with gay characters) library. The film is about people, and not sex, which is good to see as well.",1386979200,,832,4.32051282051282
5115944,5,B0080JX4Y2,"Casper has hit it again with this movie.  The story of Adam, a LA transplant from New York, is true to form.  Like so many others, Adam's intent is to move to Los Angeles and make it big in the movie industry.  Reality leads him down the path of washed up directors and actors, seedy areas of town and a future that isn't anything he expected.  Not to mention the fact, he winds up falling in love with a star who ""wants to keep things private;"" another word for ""my fans can't know I'm gay...""  which thankfully finds a happy ending.  All in all, Casper has done an incredible job with the movie and I look forward to many more in the future.",1386979200,,643,4.186991869918699
5115945,5,B0080JX4Y2,"An incredible gay movie about fame, love, making it big and in the end love conquering it all.  No tired cliche's in this movie, some really hot boys and some minor nudity.  Well worth the rental or the purchase.  You won't be sorry",1386806400,,232,4.348837209302325
5115946,2,B0080JX4Y2,"Both the box cover and the title conveys the image that this will be a somewhat naughty, erotic tale of a young guy who leaves NYC for LA to start a new life.
The movie starts off promisingly with the handsome, charismatic Matthew Luwinski portraying Adam who moves in with a ditsy gal pal and then he begins the process of finding work. He goes through various situations until he's suddenly evolved into the number one gay porno star in America! This puzzled me since I saw no signs of him moving into this exalted stage of existence.
When the movie ends, we realize anew that we've seen no flesh, sex or any trace of sensuality. In a swimming pool sequence, we see glimpses in the background of hunky naked guys. But as far as seeing the nether regions of our hero, there's nothing. I find it strange that this indie movie would eschew nudity since mainstream movie stars like Channing Tatum, Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender have performed au natural in box office hits.
The performers are all unusually strong and on target and again, Matthew Luwinski has all the signs of becoming a major star if he gets the right breaks.",1384992000,,1129,4.594059405940594
5115947,5,B0080JX4Y2,As a gay film director it's always nice to see a gay themed film that is this good. Great script and direction and Matthew Luwinski is brilliant. One of those DVDs you will watch again and again. - Todd Michael Smith,1383004800,,216,4.2926829268292686
5115948,5,B0080JX4Y2,"I only saw half of this movie; I got called away while watching and the rental period expired in the interim. What I saw, I loved. I especially enjoyed the performances of Adam and Candy. I found myself wondering how it is a movie so good can go unnoticed, yet I have seen more highly publicized, truly awful movies than I care to recall. Anyway, the acting, writing, and directing were a joy to behold and one day I will rent it again so that I can see what happens.",1382140800,,467,4.2
5115949,2,B0080JX4Y2,"Going Down in La-La Land is a film about a young gay guy, Adam, who moves from New York and acting on the stage to Hollywood to become a film and TV actor. He lives with his also-aspiring-actor friend, Candy. When he can't find an acting job he is approached to work as an assistant in a gay porn studio. Before long he's performing in front of the camera and sent out on a couple of escort jobs. It's on one of those jobs that he falls for a famous, closeted actor.

Well, that's the general gist. I'm sure you can tell where the story is going.

Unfortunately, especially for a movie about aspiring actors, the acting is terrible. The vast majority of the dialogue is stilted and sometimes just weirdly delivered. The tone and facial expressions of the actors often didn't match the dialogue and you were left wondering if they were trying to be sarcastic, or having a joke. Even the supposedly experienced actors weren't much good.

But that can usually be overcome if the story and characters are otherwise engaging. Except they weren't. The story was thoroughly predictable. From knowing he was going to cave in and perform in some gay porn, to his drug-addicted boyfriend, to the ending. None of it was surprising. And it wasn't even believable, which is crazy, since you saw it all coming a mile away.

There's also no character development. We never find out anything about any of the characters. We don't even know how old they are, except that his friend Candy is too old to play a teenager. There's no real exploration of their friendship, and when he falls in love with the closeted actor there's not really any exploration of their relationship. When Adam lands on the front page of major magazines and newspapers, his porn career exposed, it's like he doesn't care or have any friends or family who might. Despite spending the first half of the movie wanting to become an actor, by the end that's pretty much all forgotten and you're never really let in on why.

It's really just one thing after another, with no real focus. You're never engaged with the character's motivations, except as trite cliches (he needs money, she wants to be a kept woman, he's a druggy). As a viewer, you don't really care that they don't get what they want, and you don't care when they do. It's just stuff happening to boring, self-absorbed people.

Matthew Ludwinski is absolutely gorgeous and he was so loveable in this movie. You really felt for him and what he was going through as he moved to the big city of Los Angeles to find his way.
There's a few really great sex scenes that were very tastefully done and very erotic as well.  The story line was a bit predictable , Innocent boy trying to find his way in life and being drawn into porn and prostitution industry

Has brief affair with druggy, well played by director Casper Andreas -- the only character in the film having any real depth.  Ludwinski ultimately falls madly in love with closeted TV star of successful family sitcom, afraid of losing his career if he comes out.  Resolution is predictable. Attempts at comedy fall flat.

5115952,2,B0080JX4Y2,"The plot is spelled out for you all over these reviews so I'll weigh in like this...
This movie has overall decent production values, an interesting over-arcing story and a few moments of brutal honesty that made it worth the original cheap rental (it was free on Prime or maybe 1.99 at the time). But, I don't think it was a good movie. The narrative is belabored by too many inconsequential subplots and incidental characters.  The juxtaposition between humor and drama is clumsy and ruined the impact of both elements.
Actor Matthew Ludwinski lacks the acting chops to play Adam with any nuance or depth so the character comes off as an effete pretty face. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)
The character's transition into prostitution, falling in love with a drug addict to being with John the charming, handsome but closeted Television star (well played by Michael Medico)comes across too incidentally and contrived.
John pays for his gay sex with hot model types so he would have crossed paths with guys like Adam many many times. The motivations and outcomes are far too shallow given the filmmakers obvious intention to express gravity with the choices the characters are faced with. This thing ends so trite and unlikely; purely the stuff of fantasy for the shallowest of tweens who would find the sub plots of drug addictions and prostitution edgy.
(I imagine I would have LOVED this when I was 15! It pisses me off at - well, much older than 15 ;-)",1378771200,,1470,4.78740157480315

The acting and the cinematography was excellent. The story and the script were pretty good; fresh and unique. There was a descent balance between true-to-life themes and total fantasy... I mean, I suppose a gorgeous wanna-be actor 'could' take a mail-room job at a porn factory and end up falling in love with an in-the-closet sit-com star... but, really? What are the chances? Eh, it's fiction. It's fun.

I do feel there were a few parts where attempts at comedy were forced, out-of-place and awkward, and kind of interrupted the natural flow of the movie. As they say, ""Less is more.""

5115966,5,B0080JX4Y2,"I really liked this movie for the comedic moments and because the character didn't spend half of the movie wrecking his body with drugs and having sex every other scene as is the case in many gay films. Instead this movie shows a young aspiring actor trying to make it in Hollywood without getting sucked into the craziness that usually follows.

If you are worried that this movie is just about some young, hot man going crazy in Hollywood with drugs and sex and has no real plot, don't worry, that is not the case with this movie. There are a couple full frontal scenes of men which will also delight watchers. My only complaint is that it doesn't tie up a couple of loose ends by the time the movie ends.

I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys watching gay cinema as it has laughs, romance, and some drama with a cute star to boot.",1370822400,3,857,4.383647798742138

That said, he does seem to fall right with the worst ones and as is usually the case, the ones you don't want, you can't get rid of. There is a finale that makes no sense and seemed absurd even to the characters in the movie. Overall, the movie was worth watching and the relatively high price tag but I don't think i'll watch it again. Jesse Archer has a funny cameo as a ""phone bitch"" and Judy Tenuta appears as an unrecognizable character actress ""Zinnia.""

After failing to become a T.V. star, Adam becomes a clerk at Jet Set men. To say anything more of the plot would ruin the movie. I would rank this and the Crying Game as the best gay films ever made. Like The Crying Game, LA-LA Land is dramatic, but not tragic. Also, Matthew Ludwinski is super hot.

After watching his performance, I thought I would ""search"" for him on Facebook. Where has this man been? I sent him a message, first of all complimenting him on his performance...but I also told him about several personal things. Not even three day's later, I received a ""Message"" back. I'm hoping it was actually Michael, but even if not, it meant a lot to me. It was not a pre-written ""Thanks a lot"" letter. It was personalized, and addressed my hopes and dreams. That's class. Secondly, several days ago, I received a ""text"" from Embrem Entertainment and Casper Andreas, Thanking me for purchasing the film. How could I not. It was only after ""Net Flix"" recommended this movie that I even heard of it. I watched it. It's in my ""Instant Que"" and I now own it.
It's an amazing film. The chemestry between ""Adam"" and ""John"" is sincere. We, in the Gay community, unfortunately do not have much to chose from. I remember going to the theatre and watching ""Making Love"" with Kate Jackson, Micheal Ontkean and Harry Hamlin. When they (Micheal and Harry) kissed, 3/4 of the theatre left. Then, Ang Lee bought Brokeback Mountain to the big screen. I admire the studio for taking on that project. The film was beautiful, sad...and emotionally draining. But, here again..Jake and the Late Heath bought believability and chemistry to the screen. Love is love, and it's beautiful.  It's a shame, but...at least I have ""Going Down..."", ""Latter Days"" and ""Brokeback Mountain."" If you appreciate a good story line, romance, humor and a movie that I wish wouldn't have ended...(sure would have loved to have seen how ""John's"" decision effected his career and life) get this film.

Could have been assembled from any number of other similar paper novels. No surprises in either plot or directing.  Humdrum unexciting unfolding of a predictable humdrum plot with humdrum acting in unexciting sets and locations.  Nothing very sexual as the situations were not all that believable.  On the plus side the body shots were nice even though the makeup was obvious.  Some of the actors do a fairly good job in some of the cuts but struggle to be very convincing with the corny dialog.

It also shows the human sides of all the characters involved-their good sides as well as their dark sides.  Andreas, Ludwinski, the manager of the gay porn company, and the comedy sitcom movie star all do great jobs in portraying their characters. Most significantly, the movie highlights the conflicts and dilemmas experienced by those closeted gay mainstream actors who fear that making their sexual orientation public could cost them their positions on ""family-oriented"" mainstream programs. The female ex-classmate with whom Adam stays was a riot, lending some comedy and lightheartedness to the story at some points, but ends up helping to keep Adam from going over the edge of sanity.

Released in 2012, the movie follows the trials, tribulations and exploitation of young aspiring good looking lead man (Adam), who intends (like many) to make it big in Hollywood.  It's generally a fun film, with a decent collection of characters sure to garner some laughs (including Judy Tenuta&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buy-This-Again-Pigs/dp/B001BCV74E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buy This Again Pigs</a>&nbsp;and Bruce Vilanch).  It's not all fun and games by no means, as Adam hooks up (for lack of better terms) with a drug-addicted guy and indeed bares it all for the camera to make a few bucks.

In the end however, it's fun, and spirited and won't leave you depressed and angry at the end.

5116007,5,B0080JX4Y2,"I have always very much liked those Caspar Andreas films that I have seen.  Over the course of his admirably productive career as a film maker he has become more and more technically competent, visually sophisticated and assured, and literarily interesting. This is his best film to date, in my opinion. Its attempt to present what I assume is a more or less accurate account of talented, semi-talented, and totally untalented  young people arriving in Hollywood with the intent of making a successful career in the film industry is funny, probably accurate, fairly subtle and visually interesting (that would be Matthew Ludwinski)..

Andreas frequently uses details that enrich the scenes in which they appear but which don't bludgeon one with their existence.  An example might be the musical theme that plays in the background during the first Adam/John pool scene and again when they go off together to face the press, find true love, and hopefully a job that will allow them to keep ""John Vastellli's"" house. It seems to be a love theme  (ala Wagner but without the bombast).but it is not so pronounced that it dominates the for ground of the scenes. Okay, I'll grant everyone the fact that the use of a film score is basic to good technique, but it might well be hard to integrate it into a scene appropriately and it is done well here.

The first Andreas film that I saw was Slutty Summer a film which, despite some obvious signs of being a product of a novice filmmaker, had moments that were striking and surprisingly memorable.  There were witty developments such as, if memory serves, the moment where a horror movie soundtrack style score is used to support the main character's discovery of his lover's unfaithfulness.  The main character, Markus, then finds himself in a horror movie through the creation of a living horror venue at the restaurant where he begins to work.  So Andreas's film soundtrack propensities are present in his earliest film, but show up with improved wit,style, and finesse in his latest work.

Andreas works with a loose ensemble of players such as Jesse Archer, Adam Ludwinski, Allison Lane, and others.  This would, I would guess, make for a more harmonious and easy develoment of cast co-operation and the transformation of a group of actors into an ensemble. I have only seen these actors in Anreas's films, where they perform well.  Jesse Archer as the hysterically overwrought supervisor at the talent agency where the character Adam works is a hoot and a half and it would have been interesting to see more of his character.

A few words might be said about Matthew Ludwinski as he actually seems to have more than a moderate amount of acting talent. Many people so gifted with beauty, handsomeness and style are, to paraphrase the poet, ""blessedly unravaged by even the slightest sign of intelligence, talent, kindness, empathty"", etc. M Ludwinski carries his own weight as an actor, and in so doing he carries the entire film, as he is in every, or at least almost every, scene.  He cannot be unaware of his beauty as the internet is littered with exellent photos of him naked as the day he was born, but 10 times as frisky.  However he feels about his beauty, it is in some odd moments in the film - where he stares at Grauman's Chinese near the beginning or  when he gets his tray of breakfast goodies  from ""John Vastelli"" as a reward for his friskiness the night before, etc. that he is at his best.  And there his face looks very pleasantly goofy and almost bizarre - but very, very appealing.  He looks more like a person one could know and like. because one can imagine him intelligent, talented, kind, and empathetic.

Andreas is also not afraid to take on new actors such as the person who plays ""John Vastelli"". This actor adds a character who seems most appealing and works well with the storyline. The character construction by this actor for ""Johan Vastelli"", makes the almost instant connection between his character and ML's character plausible.  Which must be hard to do.  There is a poem in which a girl want to be loved for her self alone and not her yellow hair.  The last verse makes the claim that only God  can love her for herself alone and not her yellow hair.  Mr. Ludwinski is in the unfortunate position of it being the case that only God can love him for himself alone and not his naked butt (or legs, or you just name your part).  However,  the actor who plays John Vastelli creates a character that clearly likes ""Adam Zeller"" for far more than his naked butt and this is appealing. And that allows Matthew Ludwinski to create a character who is lovable for much more than his naked butt.  They seem at the end of the movie to be riding off to a love affair (which is interesting in the long term) and not a session at Jet Set Men - which probably be very interesting, but only in the short term.

So, if you are in the mood for a plausible love story between two appealing characters, this is a good film to see.

A film well worth viewing and owning. If you liked the earlier Andreas films, this will be most pleasing to you.",1355702400,,5106,4.634850166481687

But it is simply so sweet & perfect for a romantic at heart like me. It helps a lot too that all the main characters are so beautiful to look and can act well. My favourite character is actually the zany girlfriend, Candy, who provides such an honest and funny view of how things work in Hollywood.

Actor fell in love with porn star? :-) OK. Its because this porn star has pure heart? :-)
Of course it is in L.A.? :-)

But the very first guy he met is addicted? :-) Which is obvious after 4 min.
His (actor) hero refuses for the first time, but then he goes out, proudly!

And the main character (porn star)? He is sooo gay!

5116020,2,B0080JX4Y2,"In short, this is just bad gay melodrama, and not that interesting or believable.  The director's main interest seems to be the lead actor's nipples -- I kid you not. They are perky and nice, but unfortunately, this is not enough to sustain my attention over 2 hours. The writing is at times embarrassingly bad. There are lame attempts at humor (the lead's friend and her 'slave'), lame attempts at Hollywood insider gossip (the awkward David Geffen character), and lame attempts at exposing the porn industry (yuck is the way to sum it up).

The funniest part isn't meant to be funny -- it involves a boyfriend/porn director with an addiction that you can sense coming a mile away.  He has a really bad pencil shave and a reptilian stare that makes you legitimately wonder how Mr. Perky Nipples would ever have fallen for this lizard. When he hits bottom (pardon pun) it's like a scene from a zombie film.  But it is played as serious social commentary, so it is spectacularly bad. Oh how I yearned for some John Waters satire...

There are some redeeming qualities to the film. Despite the sense that this is an amateur production, the main actors are all professional and doing their best to make it work somehow. It is endearing to see how hard they try, and I found myself wondering wistfully if we will ever hear from them again.  And heck, there is some self respect towards the end if you make it that far.  At least there were no suicides.

Will gay films always be the equivalent of the gay rainbow flag - cheap, poorly designed, and ugly?  Will the genre ever grow up, and deliver more depth and better quality?  One has to wonder if the vapid memes of modern gay culture (paper thin superficiality, drugs, gossip, porn addictions, etc.) consign gay films to the trash heap of cinema.

That this movie has a story and message to deliver, which is done elegantly and subtly, is what made the movie relevant for me.

Beauty is only transitory. The main determiners of happiness in our lives are internal guiding values, acceptance of self and the dignity we accord others. While Adam is beautiful and time spent at the gym is obvious, I found this movie to be on a deeper level very life affirming. Without destroying the plot, suffice it to say that Adam discovers the inner courage to live life on his own terms.

5116040,5,B0080JX4Y2,"Going Down in La-La Land is a movie for grownups. Casper Andreas takes a walk on the dark side. It contains the themes of love and sex which permeate his movies, but it also deals with our current society's obsession with fame and celebrity. Humor is present but it is a dark prickly (pun intended) humor.
There are three standout performances.  One is the very handsome Matthew Ludwinski who is perfect as the aptly named Adam who moves to LA, is soon faced with many tempatations, and ends up dong porn.  He has the boy-next-door quality of Joey Stefano and a very expressive face and voice. The second is Allison Lane as Candy the best friend to Adam. She is great as the epitome of the celebrity seeker, and she provides comic relief with perfect timing. Third is Casper Andreas himself as the sleazy drug-addled Nick who seduces Adam into the porn business. Nick is a director who has been reduced to directing pornos. It is quite a change from the Casper we are used to seeing and showcases his range.
The scene in the hospital after Adam overdoses thinking that his actions have ruined his life sums up the movie. Perez Hilton as the orderly Ricky comes into the room and tells Adam that his scandal has made him ths subject of the celebrity blogs.  Adam's first reaction is one of horror.  However, Ricky tells him that he thinks everthing about it is FABULOUS! Adam thanks him and manages a smile.
The title of my review alludes to the two great movies on this theme. Going Down in La-La Land provides a great contemporary retelling of a familiar story and a new level for Casper Andreas films.",1348358400,3,1603,4.555555555555555

The story has all of the characters I might expect to encounter if I set out to be a movie star.
Casper Andreas writes and directs in a way that makes me feel as if I'm there with the characters, experiencing this first-hand.
Along the way, even little touches in the plot (like the parking tickets) made me laugh, especially at the conclusion.

The casting is flawless. A great job by all of the actors (even the cameos).

Matthew Ludwinski is perfectly cast as LA newbie Adam. His good-natured charisma kept me hooked from the first shot.

Allison Lane is hilarious as Adam's best friend Candy. Her self-obsessed, zany antics made me laugh out loud throughout the film.

Michael Medico makes an endearing love interest as John. He and Adam have mesmerizing chemistry.

It's fantastic to see Jesse Archer playing against type. He was almost frighteningly true-to-life as Matthew, a boss with no sense of humor. (Haven't we all had one?)

Casper Andreas's portrayal of enigmatic Nick had me alternately repulsed by and sympathetic to his character. I love the sweet characters Casper has previously played, but this performance was riveting.

Definitely one of my favorite Casper Andreas films. I'm pleased to see the production values getting better with each film he directs.

5116045,4,B0080JX4Y2,"I really enjoyed this film!!  That's saying a lot coming from me since I tend to not like gay-themed movies - especially American gay films.  I've found them far too sentimental or shallow or a combination of both.  But this little gem is neither of those things.  It's a wonderfully crafted story about a handsome young man who moves to Los Angeles in search of a TV or film acting career and gets so much more than he bargained for.  Being from Los Angeles myself, I can say the film is very accurate in its depiction of the seedy, depraved, nasty and drug-laden culture of the city.  I actually lived that culture much to my detriment many years ago until fate whisked me away to the midwest.  Anyway, this film is extremely well written, directed, shot and acted.  I was totally involved in it and found myself clapping as the closing credits began to roll.  Bravo to all involved and I hope it leads to bigger and better things for the actors and especially the gifted director.  Strongly recommended!

5116047,5,B0080JX4Y2,"I love happy endings. In the context of male-male relationships, I know just how tough it can be for us,gay men, so, the ""Pretty Woman"" type ending to this film colours it with the hue of a great gay fairy tale. Being the eternal realist, I didn't find the story-line entirely believable but I did think that the characters were - honest portrayals of gay men as we really are with no excuses and no apologies. The lead, Matthew Ludwinski, was stunning, not just in terms of his physical beauty but his tender portrayal of an impressionable Hollywood wannabe who's sexually confident yet emotionally vulnerable. Casper Andreas was equally stunning as the sexy, troubled Nick - his acting ability is only rivalled by his directorial talent and I am still awed by how he captured Nick's suffering, which is the suffering of too many gay men who've allowed happiness to slip through their fingers in exchange for a temporary high, so succinctly. Last but not least, this review would not be complete without some thoughts on Allison Lane's comedic yet compassionate portrayal of the quintessential Hollywood wannabe living in constant denial. Bravo and brava, cast and crew : This is one great gay fairy tale that I can watch over and over and over again !",1345420800,3,1253,4.805555555555555
5116048,3,B0080JX4Y2,"I received an email this morning asking me to review this film. So, here goes. I am a big fan of independent movies and happy to support them in any way I can. La La Land is a well constructed film with a coherent story, great production values. and makes good use of the LA scene. The acting in the film is generally good and well meaning and the actors seem well suited to their roles. I had some trouble with a couple of areas, however. First, in too many independent gay-themed films, the line between drama and comedy is a little dodgy. Here, the role of Judy Tenuda was neither funny or interesting. It seemed to me to be a complete waste of time. The film would have better not to have her perform.
Also, it was somewhat difficult for me to understand why Michael Medico (the tv star) was so smitten with Matthew Ludwinski (the porn star).  The character of Matthew was not fleshed out enough to see really what type of person he was, and what it was that so attracted, Michael, who seemed like a really good catch. Perhaps it was his looks and how good he was in the sack? Other than that, (or if only because of that), it seems to me that Michael would soon tire of Matthew and regret giving up everything to be with him.
Many of the characters in the film seemed true to form however, especially the director's film descent into drug addiction, and the scatterbrained girl friend of Matthew.
While, I won't keep this film in my permanent collection of film at present, I would recommend it to anyone as a good story, well acted and interesting to watch.",1345420800,4,1563,4.371134020618556

5116050,5,B0080JX4Y2,"Casper Andreas is one of my favorite film-makers. His movies always surround real life people in challenging situations.  His character studies of how these individuals react to circumstances beyond their control, or dangerously outside their comfort zone are always fasccinating to watch.  This movie is no different.  These are people you know, live next door to, are friends with, or maybe they could be you!  And Casper writes tales that make you care about what happens to his characters...you get to know them and are invested in the outcome.  He also knows how to splice humor into scenes otherwise filled with pathos.  And in this day and age, it is heart warming to find gay friendly films that aren't necessarily about being gay...this is a story of a young man whose life takes turns that he does not expect, and maybe, for which he is not prepared...and we root for him, and his friends to have that happy ending...and La La Land doesn't disappoint!

Young, ambitious and gay, Adam Zeller arrives from New York with the looks and talent to become a star but soon finds himself lost in a seamy (and steamy) underworld of gay porn and male prositution, dealing with down-and-out directors, washed up starlets, crystal meth addicts and the pretty boy Hollywood A lister. He struggles to find his way back to the road of stardom, bu first gets a first-hand education on the X-rated film industry and finds out what really goes on in the town's top talent agencies. But it's not long before he's reduced to working as a male prostitute, turning tricks with a billionaire businessman and getting a peek inside the closet of one of America's most beloved TV stars.

5116054,4,B0080JX4Y2,".....""Brokeback Mountain.""  ......(*Alternate title for this review:  ""I Hear the Crabcakes are Excellent"").

((  3.5 STARS ARE ACTUALLY AWARDED  ))

In its first near two-thirds running time, ""Going Down in Blah-Blah Land,"" is the typical ""Hollywood meat grinder"" story about all those young newbies scrambling for a foothold, after arriving in the world's film capital.  (WARNING:  Beware those Gay video porn-mills!).  ....Ah, BUT, then come the very best parts, where we start to see...(well, you'll find that out, below).

NOW TO OUR CAST:  And saving the best for last, here's a glimpse at the major characters...beginning with:

- *Allison Lane, as the ditzy B(Girl)FF of the male Lead.  Named ""Candy"", she is the supportive and often funny--yet sometimes tiresome--friend from back home.  (Good for Allison...she gets more screen time than anyone other than our main star).

- Next, in a major (time-wise) supporting role, we have the Director, himself:  Casper Andreas, playing a ""User"" of a guy, who we'll later see as the true scuzzball he becomes.  (This viewer thinks Andreas would do well, in future, spending all his time BEHIND the camera....for I'm starting to picture him as he appears in his last scene---or is that just effective acting?).

- AND FINALLY:  Let's speak to that ""CHEMISTRY"" mentioned above.  RARELY, in an American produced Gay film, do we get to see such an emotionally deep relationship between two men.  It was obviously developed by main actor, Matthew Ludwinski (as our gorgeous ""Adam"") and his co-lead, Michael Medico (as sweet, but closeted, ""John"") during their shooting time with one another.  Their ""few"" scenes together will keep you RIVETED.  We can a..l...most Touch what they burn off the screen at us. (And there's the shame of this movie:  56 and one-half minutes into it before we even see this couple together--except for a ""prologue"" of sorts).  NEVERTHELESS, you tell me if the likes of this film relationship has been seen, in this country, since the days of ""Brokeback Mountain""!

Oh, I had my doubts, well into this movie......but Matthew Ludwinski held me to it.",1344729600,7,2121,5.110787172011662
5116055,5,B0080JX4Y2,"I had seen a lot on Face Book about this movie. I have seen all the movies that Casper has done and enjoyed them all. Up to this point, I never really got that excited about them. Well, this movie surprised me. I streamed it from Amazon , which gave me a 48 hour rental. I got my money's worth as I must have watched 10-15 times. I am now going to buy the DVD to add to my library. The acting was far superior to previous movies. Matthew did an excellent job at portraying Adam. The scene in the hospital bed, with the tear running down his cheek, brought tears to my eyes. There was only one incident that I felt the actor was bad. That was the guy who was giving the pre-oscar party. I felt that he was reading his lines. All I can say is, ""Well done Casper.""",1344470400,2,761,4.0131578947368425
5116056,5,B0080JX4Y2,"This movie surprised me. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was, but I was pleasantly mistaken. Very good movie, excellent cast and terrific ending.

The movie follows Adam as he dives headfirst into the LA scene, living with a friend, trying to get a job as an actor. He ends up going through a few low-end jobs, ends up dabbling in an adult industry and meeting quite a few interesting people. The movie has some good scenes, some hot scenes (though tastefully done, so not to feel like a porno), and some very touching scenes that may or may not have you getting misty eyed. If you like a good romance/making it in the world type of story, this movie is for you!

5 out of 5 stars.",1344297600,3,691,4.2272727272727275
5116057,4,B0080JX4Y2,"Going Down In La-La Land is an interesting film about a young man who moves to L.A. to pursue acting, and experiences many highs and lows. This is a movie that held my interest from beginning to end, but never really blew me away. It's labeled as a dramedy, but trust me when I say that is has far more drama than comedy. Matthew Ludwinski (who stars as Adam) is devastatingly good-looking and bears a striking resemblance to Luka Magnotta. Worth seeing if you want to see a gay soap-opera, with a hot lead.",1343174400,2,507,4.404255319148936
5116058,4,B0080JX4Y2,"The story, based on a novel of the same name, is similar to that of the film 'The Fluffer' only not as dark. This film is along the veins of ""Between Love and Goodbye"" and not his comedies, such as the amazing 'Violet Tendencies'.

The synergy of the male actors (including love interest #2, Michael Medico) is its strength, and it holds the film up well. The main actor, Matthew Ludwinski (as Adam), was enjoyable and believable in his role... and, obviously, not hard on the eyes.  Director Casper Andreas did a splendid job as porn director/love interest #1, Nick. I thought it was great/interesting to see him in a role outside of his evolving/continuing role of 'Markus' in several of his other films (though, I do love that character). The seduction of Adam in to the industry is as seductive as the romantic/sexual interactions with these two lead men.

I found the pace off at times, though, as it tried to interject comedy via Allison Lane (as 'Candy') in to the more serious cinematic piece, which unfortunately gave the film a few unbalanced moments.

Finally, the film is wonderfully shot; it looks stunning! I highly recommend checking it out.",1342915200,8,1156,4.765
5116059,5,B0080JX4Y2,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. It's true that the story is quite simple, but the execution is absolutely superb! It's my favourite Casper Andreas's film and the new star, Matthew Luwinski, is absolutely stunning!",1342483200,2,209,5.0
5116060,5,B0080JX4Y2,"""Going Down in LA-LA Land"" cements Casper Andreas' position as a young independent filmmaker who knows how to deliver the goods!  Thoughtful, funny, insightful, and emotionally honest, ""Going Down..."" may mark Andreas' best to date.",1342483200,2,232,5.628571428571429
5116061,5,B0080JX4Y2,"We are supportive of gay cinema and own DVDs all Casper Andreas' films.  Going Down in La-La Land is one of his best works alongside The Big Gay Musical and the incredible short Mormor's Visit.  The film is a faithful adaptation of Andy Zeffer's book, although not as gritty.  The characters are well-defined and portrayed, especially by Allison Lane and Casper himself.  Bruce Vilanch adds a wonderful touch in a cameo appearance as Missy, a porn film director.  Meanwhile, Casper Andreas' own direction is smooth and tight in this film.  It is not surprise that Going Down in La-La Land is a hit at LGBT film festivals and is well worth adding to a home library.",1342310400,2,664,4.681034482758621
5116062,5,B0080JX4Y2,"Despite what some critics state, this movie is not a porn. It's just a comedy about a young man (Matthew Luwinki) who moves to L.A. in order to search for a job as actor. The movie obviously is a critic towards those who take advantage of young and goodlooking people who surrender to any request sometimes in order to get a job. The character are funny even the 'bitch' ones (Archer). Very noteworthy are Ludwinski and Lane who could be compared to some famous on-screen couples of the past.",1342137600,2,492,4.53932584269663

5116066,5,B0080JX4Y2,"Another wonderful film directed by Casper Andreas.  His films continue to get better and better.  This film based on the novel of the same name is about a young gay man who comes to L.A. to make it as an actor.  Instead he falls into porn and prostitution - but after a bad relationship with a porn director (played by Casper Andreas), he falls in love with a closeted actor who initially hires him for his special services.  The acting and direction are superb and the quality of the film is excellent considering Casper produces his films with little budget and a short shooting period.  This is one of the best gay romantic comedy/drama's I've seen in a long time.  I especially appreciated the upbeat ending.  Here's to love! Five stars plus *****.  Thanks Casper, please keep making more wonderful films.",1341014400,2,809,4.6879432624113475
5116067,3,B0080JX4Y2,"Good film, but a bit of a soap opera and some of the acting is a little hard to take.
Beautiful man (Matthew Ludwinski) comes to Hollywood and ends up in West Hollywood and like all good fairy stories. The prince goes through trials and wins his prince, somewhat, prince charming.
It's not bad film, it's just, in my humble opinion, not Casper Andreas best, but it still can make you laugh. Jesse Archer is great as an up-tight phone Nazi; you do feel for Adam (Mathew).
It you like soaps and a bit of cheese, you will like this, maybe watch this before you buy and remember to do it legally, so we can support great gay film makers like Casper Andreas",1340928000,,652,4.308943089430894
