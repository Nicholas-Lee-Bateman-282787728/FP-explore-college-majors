8539565,5,B001L9EXSO,"In interests of full disclosure, I have to say that I study with Dean. That should only make the value of this DVD more apparent because I still use it though I have access to the man himself. I've had this DVD for about a year and I'm still exploring it. There's that much to it. It's isn't for beginners or somebody looking for a teacher to hold his hand. You have to put in the work yourself but Dean gives you a ton of great ideas and more importantly, he emphasizes the value of MUSIC- something we guitar players often loose track of in the search for superior technique. The stuff on quartal harmony is worth the price of the DVD alone. I was sick of having people who couldn't really explain it make up explanations to placate me. Who better to learn from than a man who's doing it on the road with guys like Marcus Miller, Michael Brecker and a whole host of other heavy musicians. Let me state again, if you're looking for licks and tricks, this isn't for you. But if you want to make better music, I can't think of a single better DVD. Lastly, the play along tracks are awesome. You get to play cool tunes along with a smoking band. Check out ""Just Do It."" Pure fun on the guitar.",1255651200,4,1191,4.228070175438597
