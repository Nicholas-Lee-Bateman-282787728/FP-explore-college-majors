8558105,5,B00AVXXDUA,"This is one tough DVD and a great compliment to Cathe's ""Cardio Leg Blast.""  I haven't done the mat work since the exercises are closely aligned with a lot of others in Cathe's video collection but I found the standing leg segment to be brutal and while the stability ball moves weren't easy they actually were a relief after getting through the first part.  This video is similar to ""Lean Legs and Abs"" and has the same issue as far as being somewhat scattered is concerned (i.e. it's done in pieces rather than an entire flowing workout) but that was fine; I'd rather pick and choose rather than do the entire thing at once.  There are plenty of premixes that give you so many options that none of this was a problem for me.

After a warm up that includes squats, lunges, walking sumo squats, etc., you move on to standing legs, stability ball legs, mat legs and two bonus sections: barre and rear delts.  Standing legs alone will give you shapely muscles since you do forward Dixie Cup lunges for the glute area, plie squats with a weight and stability ball to fry the inner thighs, pulsing lunges with a light weight, deadlifts, sliding disc forward and backwards lunges and finish with a firewalker band to target the outer thighs and glutes.  I was cursing the screen during the inner thigh/stability ball portion and pulsing lunges but Cathe moves on quickly enough that they are do-able, albeit painful.  When Cathe says even she needs a bit of rest you know it's not a walk in the park!

The stability ball segment is essentially hamstring work, bridge raises and pulsing glute moves.  Lying on the mat was wonderful after doing standing legs but again this part wasn't a snap either.  However, it was fast and effective and that in itself was a plus.  As I noted in the beginning I didn't complete the mat routine but it consists of ""clams"", inner thigh raises, straight/bent leg lifts and pizza presses; other than the ""clams"" and inner thigh moves I thought the rest were too similar to Turbo Barre and skipped them because of that.  The same goes for the bonus barre.  If you have the Turbo Barre DVD you'll recognize everything.  If not it is worth it!  I loved the bonus rear delts as a good stand alone routine for the posterior deltoid muscles, which tend to be ignored elsewhere.

All and all I love the XTrain series and ""Legs"" was no exception.  There is no cardio effect (""Lean Legs and Abs"" has a bit of that and obviously ""Cardio Leg Blast"" has a lot of it) but this a fun workout with plenty of variety and Cathe as usual is very positive and encouraging. I highly recommend anything by Cathe!  Even though she is advanced and seldom gives modifying tips she will whip you into shape as long you know how to listen to your body and know what you can and cannot do.",1463875200,,2788,4.498015873015873
8558106,5,B00AVXXDUA,"Wow. Although this leg workout doesn't require heavy weights, my legs were exhausted and shaky immediately after, and felt completely fried the next day. I love this workout because, as one of the other reviewers said, it's very energizing, has very little dread-factor, and is incredibly effective.

I'm a big Cathe fan. I've been exercising at home forever and over the last few years, my DVD collection has slowly come to be dominated by Cathe workouts. I recently got the Xtrain series (as a reward for landing a new job!) and started the 90-day undulating program (albeit, a somewhat abbreviated version -- I do the designated workout on the designated day, but often do a shorter premix because I just don't have the time to workout for an hour-plus every day).

I've done this legs workout twice. Each time I've done the standing and barre portions only (so I can't really comment on the other parts), but each time I've been blown away by how hard just doing those sections works every part of the leg (including calves!) in only 45 minutes. Like I said, my legs were literally shaking (and burning!) immediately after. And the soreness that comes on the day or so after has got to be proof of just how effective this workout is.

I can't say enough how much I enjoy this workout. I like that I can get such a satisfying and tough workout without having to use heavy weights. It's especially nice for the days when I leave my workout for the end of the day -- after spending the day hunched over a desk, the last thing I want to do when I get home is labor under a loaded barbell. This workout is perfect for those days -- and yet, you WILL work those legs.

Highly recommend.",1371772800,4,1684,4.511475409836065
8558107,5,B00AVXXDUA,"This DVD is part of Cathe's Xtrain series. Cathe gives us both new and traditional leg exercises.  This is more of a metabolic/endurance type leg workout, so you don't need to use heavy weights.

This has quickly become one of my ""go to"" workouts.  These are special workouts that I love to do when I'm feeling lethargic or out of sorts.  After doing the workout, I feel energized and happy.  I am ready to take on the day!

The basic workout is 51:42 minutes.  The bonus workouts are:

*Barre - 15:25 minutes
*Rear Delts - 13:35 minutes
*100 Rep Challenge Hip Thrusts - 6:09.

The equipment you'll need:

*Dumbbells - Cathe uses 5, 8 and 10 pounds
*Stability ball
*Slide & glide discs
*Dixie cups
*Firewalker loop
*Chair.

The workout is broken down into sections of standing leg work, stability ball work and floor work exercises.  It's very easy to mix and match the basic sections as well as adding in the Bonus workouts.  I especially like doing the basic + barre workout, which clocks in at about 70 minutes.

STANDING LEG WORK

The walking lunges aren't too bad, nor are the forward leaning lunges with the Dixie cups.  My legs start to burn with the plie wall squats and by the low pulse lunges, they are screaming.  I am talking back to Miss Cathe at this point.

We end with the firewalkers.  I use the green band, which is the easiest. It sure doesn't feel easy at this point.  I'm half hoping my band will break so I can continue the exercise without the band.

BALL & CHAIR

I will admit it; I hate hamstring rollouts on the stability ball.  I hate them because they are hard and my muscles scream.  I can't even use the excuse that I think they are unsafe and that's why I hate them.  I need them though because they work my hamstrings like nothing else.

I'm glad the rollouts are the beginning exercises so they are over before I know it.  We end with doing glute bridges with your foot on a chair.  Compared to the ball rollouts, these seem almost easy.

FLOOR

This is another series that sneaks up on you.  Or should I say it quickly catches up with you.  Those weighted pizza presses get me every time, even when I use teeny weights like 3 pounds, instead of the 5 pound weight that Miss Cathe uses.

BARRE

I have a newfound love of barre work.  This section is not as hard as Cathe's LIS Turbo Barre workout, but it's a nice addition to the other leg exercises.

You can certainly make this workout harder by using heavier weights and by going deeper with the body weight exercises.  I will mix things up and when I do my next Xtrain rotation, I'll do my one rep max and really hit the weights hard.

I definitely recommend this workout for those looking for a fun and different workout that will leave you feeling energized for the entire day.",1364428800,4,2766,4.393280632411067
8558108,5,B00AVXXDUA,Another great workout from Cathe.  You always feel it the next day. This won't disappoint you. I love all her workouts,1362787200,,118,4.619047619047619
8558109,3,B00AVXXDUA,"I love Cathe's leg workouts typically. She usually goes really heavy on the weights and hits them hard from all angles. This workout is different, in a way that didn't entirely work for me. The workout contains a weight segment, which is good but short, a barre segment, and a floor segment. There is also a rear delt bonus workout. If you do all sections, and the rear delts, this is an 80 minute workout.  Each of the sections is good enough, but leave me wanting more. I think the variety came at the expense of intensity on this workout.",1362268800,2,541,4.41
