2388795,1,B000AEZTYI,"I honestly don't understand how anybody would make a women-in-prison film this uninteresting.  It's obvious that the director and/or producer had no idea regarding the whole genre of captive women thrown together.  There's two routes they could have gone, but they did neither:

1)  The serious look at women behind bars.  Unattractive women who are bored and occasionally fight or do drugs.  Interesting only in a docu-drama sort of way, exposing our societal ills, blah, blah, blah...

2)  The campy, tough-lezzies-preying-on-pretty-new-inmates approach.  Pretty girls being used and abused by the bitchy female warden, her mean dykey female guards, and/or the tough lezzie inmates who possess a taste for pretty, young, female flesh.  Always a popular WIP approach.

But ""Bad Girls Dormitory"" decided to go for an un-erotic, campy, let's-include-guys, no-girl-girl-action, yawn-fest-approach that included none of the above and earns this film a solid one-star.  What a complete waste of an otherwise good female cast!",1171497600,22,1021,5.558441558441558

2388797,2,B000AEZTYI,"Shockingly little skin for a mid-80s WIP.  Aside from one hanging, shockingly little violence.  Lots of dark (i.e. what am I looking at?) scenes show they couldn't pay for a electrician on the set.",1167436800,26,197,4.764705882352941
2388798,2,B000AEZTYI,"A WIP (Women in Prison) film set in New York in the mid-1980s, this film features all the 'big hair' of that era. This film is no different from as a dozen other WIP movies, such as ""Red Heat "" (with Linda Blair), only the location is different. The plots are all the same; a few backstories to show the brutal lives various women suffered before turning up in an even more brutal institution. Lots of sex with sadistic prison guards, and an eventual rescue.

This film features some of the same cast, and even the same locations as another film made by the same director Tim Kincaid, in the same year; Breeders... this gives you an idea of the budget - and it looks like a budget movie",1154649600,21,686,4.317829457364341

8078348,1,B000AEZTYI,"The story gets no love but that's not why we watch these dumb films. It's for the campy cheese and nostalgic peek into a bygone era. And the so bad they're good female cast who love to show off their chesticles. No complaints here other than the movie is so awful.

A few highlights include the music and horrendous 80's hair. The sadistic red head guard with a unforgettable fight stance in her high heels. The dance number with the crappy synthy 80's Scorch song playing is worth the price of the dvd. The final act gets pretty violent and fun but Tim Kincaid's Breeders is a much better watch. A prolific XXX director Tim definitely loves the ladies.

Some of the fight sequences are fun and rad to make fun of. But in the end the movie just doesn't satisfy. Unless you're depraved as me and then it's a blast and gets better with each subsequent viewing.",1431820800,,858,4.424050632911392

8078351,3,B000AEZTYI,"Nothing like a teen prison girl film with a bunch of women in their 20's. This film has nude shower scenes, cavity search, full frontal nudity, cat fights, sex, rape, incest(?),  sadistic guards, a female guard with spiked heel boots, and a bad warden. It is as if they knew everything to put into a prison girl film except a plot and Linda Blair. It also drops the F-bomb, and when things get bad, they go to a worse flashback. The tough girl language and accents were comical. You could do worse. Erotic camp value.",1361750400,4,517,4.442105263157894
8078352,5,B000AEZTYI,"Ah, the mid-'80s.  The big hair.  The cheesy synthesizer music.  The drugs.  The babes.  The sleaze.  It's all here and much more in Tim Kincaid's trashy 1985 women in prison effort ""Bad Girls Dormitory.""

It all takes place at a New York City dormitory for erstwhile female juvenile offenders.  Some are there for prostitution.  Some for drug dealing.  Some for manslaughter.  A few, such as the main protagonist in the film, Lori (Carey Zuris), wouldn't be there had it not been for the manipulation and abuse by some very scummy male perpetrators.  Once in, the good upright girls like her are at the mercy of a butchy queen bee antagonist named Lisa (Jennifer Delora) and her sidekick Rebel (Donna Eskra).  Fights, even murders, ensue.  And don't look to the facility's staff for any help.  They're just as corrupt as everyone else.

""Bad Girls Dormitory"" is trash, knows it's trash and even relishes in the fact, making for a delightfully fun viewing each and every time.  And let's set the record straight here -- unlike what some have said, many of the girls in this movie are TOTALLY hot.  Carey Zuris is drop dead gorgeous, in a mid-'80s kind of way, and really does have extremely ""pretty eyes,"" to quote the film itself.  And we get to see much more of her as well and some other of the young babes in any one of the several sultry shower scenes included here.  I also think her initial performance as the shy, sensitive girl transplanted into a virtual hellhole is quite effective.  There are also drugs, like one of the other girls, who has a habit of sneaking into the dormitory's basement after hours to smoke a late night joint.  This makes her very vulnerable and disoriented, particularly when she is caught by and falls prey to a most unscrupulous male staff member.  For trash lovers, you name it, this movie has it, and the fact that the budget is low and the camera work occasionally unsteady only adds to its gritty D.I.Y. charm.

I first caught snatches of this one when USA used to show it at about 2:30 in the morning on their ""Up All Night"" program (as another reviewer has previously offered) in the late '90s or early '00s.  2010 just happens to be the 25th anniversary since the film was made, and it remains an energetic sleaze classic to this day.  If you like hot young girls in various states of undress, catfights, shootings, jealousy, intrigue, a great cheesy '80s synthesizer soundtrack, and a real desire to deliver the goods, then ""Bad Girls Dormitory"" is the movie for you.  Great fun all around.

(April 2011 update:  At the time I wrote this originally, the copy I was reviewing was the 2003 Westlake Entertainment full screen release which is clearly transferred from an old VHS, complete with the occasional skips and jumps characteristic to that format, and containing no special features.  I have since upgraded to the superior 2008 reissue on Shriek Show, which is widescreen, with a good, clean and uninterrupted transfer.  It even contains a bonus 15 minute interview with Jennifer Delora, who offers her recollections of the making of the film and working with her crew and castmates.  Very interesting stuff indeed.  If you are a fan of this movie, as I am, the Shriek Show pressing comes highly recommended and should make the older, cheaper VHS-like DVD all but obsolete.)",1282262400,3,3325,4.7269565217391305
8078353,3,B000AEZTYI,"The first time I watched BAD GIRLS DORMITORY (upon its original release in an actual movie theater no less) I thought it was poorly made, poorly lit, and badly edited.  The film was ""discovered"" by a cable TV series called USA UP ALL NIGHT, and the film became a late-night hit.  I have watched it several times since then, and it actually does get better on subsequent viewings.  Shot on 35mm in the mid-1980s for the exploitation market (there actually was a market for this), it was a NYC independent production with a very low budget.  Three nice girls are set up (by men, of course) and land in a correctional facility.  We know this because: a) the sign says so, and b) the building has barbed wire outside of it!  The film seems to stop every ten minutes or so for an ""action"" sequence, which appear to be dropped into the film because someone told the filmmakers the genre needed them. No one told him they did not have to look so staged.  The sleaze factor is evident from the beginning.  A doctor puts on a plastic glove to form a cavity search (no, not a latex glove - that would have cost too much.  It's the type of plastic glove food handlers are supposed to use), and when the girls bend over, he takes the glove off with a smile.  What stands out upon repeated viewings is how good (among an oasis of bad) some of the performances are.  Dan Barclay as Dr. DeMarco and Rebecca Rothbaum as Nurse Stevens stand out.  Barclay is subtle (unusual for this genre), well spoken and realistic.  It's astonishing this his is only credit listed on IMDB.  With his handsome looks and good manner, he should have done much more work.  Rothbaum is also someone who gives a good performance, and ditto when you look her up on IMDB.  Rick Gianasi, the matinee idol lead, at least went on to do more work.  Oh, and just try to get the song HOSE ME DOWN out of your head after you hear it.",1248825600,6,1887,4.345714285714286
