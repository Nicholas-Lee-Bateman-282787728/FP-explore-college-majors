8435668,1,B004M8SRFQ,"Although $1.99 is pocket change, Amazon has a lot of nerve charging for this hideously terrible print of Trapped in Tia Juana.  I have loved Duncan Reynaldo since enjoying him in the role of The Cisco Kid as a boy growing up in the fifties.  However, this print is so extremely out of focus and overexposed as to be unwatchable.  The background noise is deafening and the dialog can barely be heard, a major problem since the movie's sound is distorted and often unintelligible.  The picture jumps and flickers.  An atrocity all around.",1425427200,,536,4.720430107526882
8435669,4,B004M8SRFQ,"Quite good for 1932, good plot development, good chemistry between the leads -, altogether a pleasant quaff",1412553600,,107,5.352941176470588
8435670,1,B004M8SRFQ,"I don't know why Amazon bothers to offer this DVD as the image quality is extremely bad!! At the same time I ordered this disk I also ordered two other Edwina Booth DVD's (all are old movies from 1931-1932 area). The other two disks were reasonably decent copies of their respective movies; but ""Lost in Tia Juana"" is very,very bad!",1381708800,,332,4.55
