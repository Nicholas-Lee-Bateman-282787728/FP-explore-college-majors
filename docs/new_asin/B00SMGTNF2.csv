8698901,5,B00SMGTNF2,"I never thought this would match her last great concert flick, Ringo Expo 08, but Shiina outdid herself: while the setlist skews newer and has fewer of her classics, the performance of these cuts from her last two LPS and recent Tokyo Jihen records is top notch.  The ""Vegas"" sets and outrageous costumes - dig the denoument, where she's flanked by unicorns - keep the energy level high.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.",1437609600,,411,4.774647887323944
