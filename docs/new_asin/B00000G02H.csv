1213026,5,B00000G02H,"As I read these bad reviews of this movie, I realize how lazy some film-watchers are these days.  Living in a generation that grew up watching movies, I would think that by now people would want to see movies that challenge them a little, and not simply spoon-feed them their entertainment.  I understand that people go to the movies for the simple reason of being entertained, but how long can the same old movie formulas entertain you?
It's refreshing to me to see directors like P.T. Anderson make movies because they feel passionate about the story they want to tell, not because they want it to fit into a neat, rehashed package to sell to a braindead audience.  There are beautiful images and ideas in this movie that take you on an emotional ride for 90 minutes.  The fact that Mr. Anderson makes a movie like this with his heart, knowing it won't make as much money as your average Adam Sandler movie, is reason enough to give it a try. But above all, Punch Drunk Love is an original movie, which is something we don't see enough of these days.",1054252800,60,1052,4.492146596858639
1213027,5,B00000G02H,"If you seen the previews for this movie, and you thought it was Sandlers' attempt at a ""1 Hour Photo"" or ""Man on the Moon"", you were wrong.  I did the same thing.  I thought it would be just another comedians attempt at drama(not insulting Williams or Carrey, both are great actors), but what I mean is, this is truly a role for Adam Sandler, it fit him like a glove.  I really did enjoy the movie, its funny, a little twisted, and there is even a hefty dose of reality to even things out nicely.  I can honestly say the movie never really got boring in my opinion, it remained very interesting, and unpredictable the whole time.  Its one of those movies that you wouldnt mind having in your video collection...cause it really isn't boring when you watch it a second time, its really just a very well made movie with a perfect cast.

1213028,5,B00000G02H,"Paul Thomas Anderson's fourth film was one of the best movies of 2002 and it's a shame that more people didn't see it on the big screen. It's a movie that crackles with humor, intensity and the awkward pains of being lonely and in love. It's also a movie that has a tremendous impact on the big screen: Fantastic use of the widescreen, an amazing and multilayered sound mix, and those trippy, mind-bending flashes of color between acts. ... It's Adam Sandler's best work, by far, and Emily Watson is a delight. Luis Guzman is as funny as he's ever been, though he might only have five lines in the whole film (the look on his face during the scene where one character unexpectedly asks another out on a date is priceless), and Philip Seymour Hoffman has a small, obscenity-laden role that pays off wonderfully with a pair of lights-out scenes at the end of the film. ...

1213030,4,B00000G02H,"Since the DVD is not out yet, I'm reviewing the film.  I think that Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the most innovative young filmmakers we have, especially in the main stream, and I have to admit that I was a bit surprised when I heard he picked Sandler for his latest project.  The follow-up to Magnolia is a complete turnaround for Anderson, which is something I always look for in good directors (about two Punch Drunks could fit into one Magnolia).  For the first time since Hard Eight, Anderson doesn't opt for the ensemble cast, instead focusing his lens on one protagonist.  The stark, empty sets echo the isolation of Sandler's character--another in a long line of alienated male anti-heroes stemming from characters like Holden Caulfield and Travis Bickle.  Punch Drunk continues in the vein of optimism that is Anderson's trademark, giving this modern film noir-like tale a happy ending for our neurotic little SNL-alumni.  The genius of this film is the subtleness of Sandler's portrayal.  I'm not sure if it was Anderson's or Sandler's idea, but making Egan a picture of pent-up frustration simmering just under the surface fuels the tension that makes this film work.  PTA does it again.",1050624000,2,1200,4.905940594059406

1213143,5,B00000G02H,"Love. We all need it. No matter what we've done, or who we are, if you are gonna be as happy as you can be, you need someone to love that loves you back.

PTA's love story is strange to say the least, but it is amazing. Adam Sandler is at his absolute best here, who knew he could act like that! He is truly amazing in this film. PTA creates a movie that fits the character Barry Egan, (played by Sandler), a man plagued with personality issues. When Barry meets a woman named Lena, his life is forever changed by their relationship. The camera movement, direction, writing, and most of all sound design, all perfectly fit the flawed character Barry Egan. After all this is his story, and PTA does a fantastic job of keeping you involved with it. To me this film is constantly entertaining, and I can say this for sure after liking it even more a second time.

Many love stories in Hollywood focus on perfectly (too perfect) normal people who just suddenly fall in love and blah blah all that crap. This movie shows you a tale of love between two people who are far from normal. This is an amazing idea, since many people in the world are not perfectly normal, and some find it harder than others to find love. This is why this movie is amazing. It gives you a beautifully strange, surreal story of love between two people who find each other at the right time. Watch this movie, you may not like it, but if you like PTA, definitely watch it.",1430438400,,1442,4.317343173431734

1213145,5,B00000G02H,"I give this film five stars, countering the few one-star reviews where the film clearly wasn't for them. This is a surreal (way-off-beat?) rom-com, that caught me by surprise. I watched it without knowing anything about it, that can be the best way to watch a film.

The film puts you into the mindset of loner Barry, an 'undateable', who probably has some kind of psychological problem, suspects it himself, but not being diagnosed has to bumble around life, irritating others and feeling uncomfortable in his own skin. The movie is odd. As such it could be difficult to watch if you already have expectations.

At one point, a scene in the warehouse, the music (constructed with 'found sound'?), is all these weird noises and there is a lot of confusion between the characters. I thought what am I watching? And why is this music so irritating - that's precisely when I got it. The frenetic dialogue and choppy, intrusive music paces you exactly into Barry's frame of mind. You FEEL his discomforted confusion which leads to proper anger - and that is where the genius lays in the film. The film is structured in perfect sympathy with the main character and gives you a much better understanding of Barry's world perception. Life is alien to Barry and Barry seems an alien to others - until Lena.

At this point you start to empathise and even flip a bit, you see it from Barry's view and maybe, as well as him being undeniably odd - it's a Mad World. Of course no new theme there, but one worthy of being reminded and it's a joy to be taken along with the characters in such a unique film that explores issues of alieneity and how love can provide connection in such disconnectedness - as the character falls into more and more painful traps of his own manic devising . . .

NOTE The film can be seen as another take on 'Brazil'. But a better analogy (though the film has a totally different feel), is 'The Science of Sleep'. Both these films can be seen as whimsical on the surface, but actually when you get to the end of 'Science of Sleep' there is some dialogue between the two lovers and Stephane's words are quite cutting, you realise it's not just the film that's dreamy, there is a genuine disconnect with Stephane, revealing a social problem and another key to the film.

No doubt the sequel has her ending up in a battered women's shelter.

Now that would probably be enough to earn it 2-3 stars except they managed to make all but maybe 10 minutes boring and painful to watch.

I suppose someone will retort that I just don't get the film.  Yeah, it's called punch-drunk love, but to me that generally implies  some meaningful connection and dialog between the  characters.

1213220,5,B00000G02H,"***********WARNING:  MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS************************************************************

It pretty much goes without saying that Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the most unique and interesting filmmakers working today.  And while he has a small--yet slender body of work that began with Hard Eight (which I have not yet seen) and the rather mildly entertaining Boogey Nights, it is the subconsciously mesmerizing trio of Magnolia, The Master (which to my mind was enough to cement the director in the lower pantheon of great filmmakers), and the aforementioned Punch-Drunk Love that defines his work so far.  Not even the utter hysterics of the criminally overrated and overacted There Will Be Blood was enough to sway him out of what he does best; the study of the human subconscious.

His juxtaposing of the study of the subconscious and the literal and formulaic defines themselves in his three opuses.  In Magnolia, it's in the cause-effect cycle and memory, with the raining frogs serving as a powerful metaphor (not even PTA understood the full extent of the film's many meanings; he stated it simply made sense to him); in The Master, it's in anarchist/comformist strain for individuality mixed in with a loosely controlled Rorschach test (in which one's perceptions on the film is defined strictly by the viewer, though it may still be influenced), and with a fictional parallel to the historical founding of Scientology.

Lastly, with Punch-Drunk Love, the study is in emotional chaos mixed in with a basic love story, this time with color playing a big theme.  Almost the entire film carries a blue or black hue to it, especially Adam Sandler's character, Barry Egan.  The film, to a certain extent, can be extended to be considered a raw study of the inner psyche of Sandler himself, with his emotional outbursts being the only glimpse we ever get from who he really is as a person.  Insecure, angry, sad, giddy, confident.  It appears not even Sandler knows for sure what kind of person he really is; the journey if nothing else, is about him finding what kind of person he wants to be the most, and by the film's end, finds emotional stability and order to the chaos.  It is very much a classic comedy even if the film is oft classified as a drama and character study, but not strictly (it should be noted that the love of his life, played by Emily Watson's Lena Leonard, wears red throughout the whole movie to juxapose and possibly counterract Sandler's own depression and inner chaos).

But behind the blossoming relationship between Sandler and Watson--both of them quite possibly giving their very best performances in their entire careers--we see so much more.  The opening scene establishes the entire method in which these multitude of moods are convened.  First, he witnesses a car accident (a symbolic forshadowing towards his much harbored rage and anguish), then he pick up an abandoned harmonium from the street (obsession and loneliness), and finally, meets Leonard herself (juxaposing the future opportunity for peace as a potential suiter with the possibility of a cycle of greater anguish and rage being a friend of one of his seven abusive sisters).  All this within a single opening scene.  After that, what started as a simple, relatively harmless visit on a phone sex hotline spirals even further down into a chaotic mix of emotions (amplified by one of the greatly underrated musical scores ever composed on film) as Sandler slowly opens up to and falls in love with Watson all the while the woman on the other end of the hotline sends thugs owned by her supervisor, Dean Trumbell (returning PTA allumini Phillip Seymour Hoffman, essentially playing a direct reflection of Egan).  One moment, we're having an emotional breakdown.  Next moment, all is warm and comforting.  Immediately after that, Sandler is assaulted and harrassed by either his sisters or the four thugs.  And immediately after that, Sandler's all giddy as he buys hundreds of thousands of pudding just to rack up flyer miles so he could fly far away from his current lifestyle forever (eventually attempting to, but failing, to convert the pudding coupons into the necessary flyer miles just to follow Watson to Hawaii--demonstrating that his alternate ways out aren't as easy to exploit as he'd imagine).  The scenes and the music gets so frantic and is constantly shifting from one emotion to the other that it becomes rather tense and uncomforting.

It is only by finally taking charge and beating his four assailants that just threatened the only bit of peace left given to him and subsequently confronting Trumbell in person--phone from the booth still in his hand to signify his strengthened resolve to maintain his control and peaceful equilibrium over his own life at all cost--that Egan finally restores order in his life.  And indeed, order to the chaos is restored.

Everybody gives absolutely first rate performances in this movie.  Even Adam Sandler.  If not for such a contentious competition at the Best Actor race in 2002, Sandler would have more than likely netted a Best Actor nod (at least Roberto Beninni wouldn't be able to reign on his parade with his critically panned Pinocchio, much like what he did with Life is Beautiful versus Jim Carrey's The Truman Show).  Emily Watson plays the role as is necessary here, and Philip Seymour Hoffman gives yet another first rate performance on his resume (the phone banter between him and Sandler near the end of the movie is far more funnier than anything that Sandler ever did as a comedian, in or out of film).

And much like with Magnolia's raining frogs or The Master's choice between a life of individual freedom versus the continuous apprenticeship into the doctrine of The Cause, order is restored to a world filled with chaos.  The only difference here is that unlike the other two films, order has been set in stone here whereas there was arguably never really any order to begin with.  However, PTA has a knack for beginning his own unique brands of classic comedy En Medias Res (I think the saying goes), or In the Middle of Things.

There is very good reason why the film sits at a very high 70% range on Rotten Tomatoes.  There is a very good reason PTA won Best Director at Cannes, nominated for the Grand Prix at the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.  Adam Sandler himself was nominated for a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Dramatic Role for this movie for crying out loud!  It is one of the greatest critical highlights of 2002 in cinema--indeed a very good year indeed, ranking one of the 10 best easily.  Had this film done well financially, Sandler would have more than likely continued honing his acting chops leaving the creativity to the creative in film.  No film he has ever done before or since has come anywhere near as close to being as unique, intense, inventive, and flatout wonderful as Punch-Drunk Love.  As a much shorter followup to PTA's self-proclaimed magnum opus, it shows that the director continues to possess the knack for great experimental films.

Highest recommendations all around--especially for all those who loathe Adam Sandler with every fiber of your being--even his runner-up films such as The Wedding Singer or Funny People.  Roger the Ocelot concurs.  Once he started purring--which was about 10 minutes in--he never stopped.  When the movie was over, he stroked his entire body around my hand and rolled around purring friendlier than he ever has before.  That, my friends, at the very least guarantees it a perfect rating.

And for future reference too, both Magnolia and The Master warrant perfect 5 star ratings as well.",1379980800,,7674,4.947778643803585

1213295,5,B00000G02H,"A short, weird confection of a film, full of wonderful moments, beautiful shots, terrific performances and odd ironies.  Adam Sandler strips away all comic overtones to play an angry, dysfunctional, fragile, obsessive compulsive - who we somehow still care for.  Emily Watson just about makes us believe she could fall for this emotional wreck.

While there are echoes of the Coen Bothers, this film is unlike any other I've ever seen.  A weird and 90% successful mash-up of Hollywood romantic comedy, art-film, exploration of despair, and surreal playfulness.  The first time I saw it, it blew me away.  The second time, prepared for its wild twists I could appreciate its subtle details more, but also noticed the holes (e.g. Emily Watson's somewhat underdeveloped character - does she willfully not see Sandler's madness, or what makes her love it?).  One of those films I look forward to watching yet again sometime.

Included also is an artwork booklet containing similar imagery used in the movie. It was (with my copy) resting under the fold containing the Feature DVD which made it easy for the booklet to slip or fall out also, so be aware of that also. I kept the booklet in the DVD case.

1213298,4,B00000G02H,"I remember reading that P.T. Anderson was trying to make a conventional Adam Sandler comedy through his own looking glass. That pretty much sums it up. Sandler's character is a tragi-comic, realistic version of every character he had ever played up to this point: a stunted, almost retarded man-child with a loving heart and uncontrollable fits of violence. Whereas in a standard Sandler film, the jokes would be played for cheap (very, very cheap) laughs and you would be expected to fall for , and root for, the character from the start, P.T. does nothing of the sort. The humor is of the uncomfortable variety, the love story is at times touching, at other times sad and even disturbing. There is an artificialty to everything; a very trippy, psychedlic feel to everything, meant, I'm sure, to indicate the mental state of Sandler's mildly insane character. It was an absolute blast watching this movie on opening weekend with all of the Adam Sandler fans who expected another 2 hours of brainless, thoughtless potty humor.
This movie speaks volumes to me, as my own brother is VERY similar to Sandler's character in almost all regards. His character is a lot more realistic than most viewers would care to admit.

1213331,1,B00000G02H,"Barry Egan is an emotional mess, inexplicably prone to violence and panic attacks. Isn't life unpredictable?

Barry has seven sisters who, perhaps, have caused some of the psychic damage in him. Or maybe not. But they sure are noisy when all in the same place. Isn't life a pain in the ass with family-of-origin?

Barry might have some form of autism -- colors are brighter, noises are more distracting. Or the perhaps the director wants us to simply be disoriented by a lot of off-kilter percussion for more existential reasons. Isn't life more interesting with artistic amplification of our senses?

Barry sometimes imagines himself working by himself in his isolated office. Isn't life lonely?

Barry actually runs a business with lots of employees out of a warehouse and nobody seems to know what is going on (neither the audience nor the characters). Isn't life chaotic and funny?

A memory of a car crash and a truck nearly runs into an initially non-reactive Barry on the street in front of his ""business"". Upon further mental processing, he scurries to the safety of his warehouse office. Isn't life scary?

A phone sex entrepreneur likes to blackmail customers because they are sinning. Isn't life ironic, populated with hypocrites?

A harmonium is dumped off in the street by Barry's business, for no particular reason. Isn't life random?

A relatively nice, well meaning sister of Barry's tries to get a friend of hers to have interest in her unusual brother. This friend shows up in his life at the same time the harmonium (how cute, a harbinger of harmony) does. Isn't life not-so-random?

Etc, etc, etc.....

And finally, in life, isn't there a soulmate for everyone?

I'd try to finish off this questionable review with some sort of coherency, but if the movie didn't bother, neither will I. Still, I hope these observations help you decide whether or not this is the sort of movie that might appeal to you. To each their own strange and unusual, this movie just didn't work for me.

1213334,5,B00000G02H,"Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) is autistic.  P.T.Anderson invites us to share Barry's experience of the world.  The film tells a story, a love story, but the real subject is Barry's inner being.

Imaginative cinematic techniques make vivid Barry's world, and, in so doing, give the audience insight into the experience of those with autism.  Colour and sound are hyperbolic and impressionistic: the abstract colourful patterns that interrupt the narrative are particular evocative; while the soundtrack threatens to overwhelm dialogue, and is often strikingly out of character (and out of rhythm) with the action on the screen: it is as if we are listening to Barry's own ""soundtrack"" - that is to say, the sound evokes the mood that pervades Barry's psyche, and this mood is something he (and we) must penetrate in order discern the external world (it's a beautiful touch when the soundtrack goes silent just as Barry begins to make a real connection with his love, Lena).  One could go further and claim that the film conjures a sensory world suggestive of synaesthesia (the conflation of the individual senses: i.e. ""seeing"" sounds, and ""hearing"" colours), synaesthesia being associated with autism.

Anderson also prises experiences from the smooth flow of time - a truck is a long way down the road, then, instantly, it is roaring past; a conversation is at one level, then, abruptly, is at another level entirely (e.g. Barry's phone call from Hawaii to his sister in L.A.).  The movie again asks us to experience the world from an altered perspective, one where the continuity between events and between mental states is awkward, jagged, or non-existent.

Barry is perplexed by his own actions and reactions.  His mantra of ""I don't know"" in answer to questions regarding his dress and behaviour is revealing - he literally does not know why he does certain things. His own emotions baffle him; they have an independent existence, only tenuously connected to one another, and only partly experienced as belonging to himself - they seem to belong not to a person, but to a situation (the boundaries are blurred between Barry's internal experience and external reality), or they belong to two separate ""people"" (thus Barry erupts into rage, then snaps back into apologetic introversion - it is as if he has two modes of being, with little capacity to stand outside both and acknowledge each as part of his complex self (a form of dissociation, in technical terms, and again a feature of some forms of autism)).  This discontinuity of the emotions relates again to the discontinuous experience of time mentioned earlier.

Barry has trouble comprehending the emotional cues of those around him.  This impedes his ability to infer the motivations of others. His own face and body language do not convey emotions readily - he is almost ""scared"" to express, from fear of not knowing what will emerge.  At times Adam Sandler's face is at war with itself, little tics and ripples conveying the sense that beneath the mask conflicting impluses are in dispute with each other. Understandably, he has trouble making connections with others, and so he fears other people, especially strangers, and avoid situations where he is likely to meet new people - yet he still desires to love and to be loved.  The mysterious harmonium is a poignant symbol of Barry's difficulty in playing a melody upon his own heart.

Lena (Emily Watson) is presented, in an appropriately 'unrealistic' way, as his love.  Why she is attracted to him is only hinted at - she mentions seeing him in a family photograph with his seven sisters and finding the family scene appealing, and appreciating the fact that she is ""needed"" by him, and that he seeks her out (that is, pursues her): all this doesn't add up to a convincing set of reasons for her to engage with him, but it does suggest her need to ""save"" or ""be saved"" by someone (or some family).

Dean ""The Mattress Man"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is at once Barry's enemy and his equal.  He understands, and shares, Barry's emotions.  He even makes his living in a related way, as a small businessman, albeit with different ethics.  Their climactic interaction is a bizarre, brilliant mirroring of minds.  Dean's henchmen are four silent brothers - something of a parallel to Barry's seven garrulous sisters.

The plague of sisters in Barry's life are literal warring voices inside his head.  One sister's criticisms blend with another's solicitations, all being similarly intrusive.  His drastic measure to silence the chorus of chiding and complaint brings a family gathering to a shattering pause - but the circus resumes, and Barry's plea for psychiatric help (made to his brother in law, the dentist) speaks of a collective family pathology, where reality is a threat, denial a reflex defence, and the boundaries porous between one family member and next - the sisters' verbal effluent floods through Barry, reducing him to a frustrated passivity.

More familiar markers of autism are deployed in the depiction of Barry's obsessionality, and his facility with numbers.

P.T.Anderson is not about to tell anyone any of this.  Why should he?  His film is a work of art, not a didactic tract.  Yet even the extras on the DVD only hint at the film's subject - rather than an explanatory commentary, or actors' revelations, there are clips of the digital art and the accompanying musical themes.  While I have no evidence for this next speculation, I wonder if the director (and possibly the lead actor) have some direct experience with autism - their understanding feels that deep.

In the end the film builds a link between the autistic and those not so afflicted - Barry finds his own emotions, and those of others, opaque; his access is limited; the love of another is fragile and mysterious; and to some degree isn't that the situation we all inhabit?

I think this film is absolutely brilliant.",1248307200,6,5917,4.9574898785425106
1213335,4,B00000G02H,"The Bottom Line:

Punch-Drunk Love is easily the least ambitious of Anderson's films, but it's still fascinating in the way it takes the violent man-child Adam Sandler character we're all sick of and plugs him into a different story, in which his outbursts look much more psychotic than funny; all things considered, it's an interesting film.

1213380,4,B00000G02H,"Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) is a child-man character prone to explosive anger, much like other Adam Sandler characters. But wait, this one is very different. Instead of a comedy, this is an art film where Sandler really delves deep into his character to find the source of his anger. It seems that his emotional development was stunted by the fact that with seven sisters, he was the only boy. They tease and torment him, but he can't really fight back, so it is all bottled up inside, except when it explodes in periodic outbursts.

The story was inspired by an article in 'Time' magazine about a University of California civil engineer name David Phillips who took Healthy Choice up on their offer of frequent-flyer miles in exchange for purchasing their products. He bought 12,150 cups of pudding for just $3,000 and thereby acquired 1.25 million frequent-flyer miles (after waiting 6 to 8 weeks for them to process his coupons).

---------------------------------
[Barry looks around... ]
Barry: Healthy Choice and American Airlines got together and put this promotion: If you buy any 10 Healthy Choice products, they will reward you with 500 frequent flier miles; with this special coupon, they'll up it to 1,000 miles. So, I think they are trying to push their teriyaki chicken which is $1.79, but I went to the supermarket and I looked around and I saw that they had pudding... for 25 a cup... comes in packages of four. But insanely... the barcodes... are on the individual cups! So, quarter a cup, say you bought $2.50 worth. That's worth 500... with the coupon it's 1,000 miles. It's a marketing mistake but I'm taking advantage of it. If you were to spend $3,000, that would get you a million frequent flier miles. You would never have to pay for a ticket the rest of your life.
Lena: You... you bought all that pudding so that you could get frequent flier miles?
==================================================

Lena is played by Emily Watson. Barry's sisters both set him up and simultaneously try to sabotage the relationship, but by clever subterfuge he manages to keep it a secret. Besides the pudding, there is also a mysterious harmonium that 'falls off a truck' (no, really, it actually does) in the street by Barry's warehouse. Barry owns his own business, though when he wears a suit and tie in an attempt to project a professional image, his sisters still see him as their kid brother playing dress up.

-----------------------------------------------
Barry: I didn't ask for a shrink - that must've been somebody else. Also, that pudding isn't mine. Also, I'm wearing this suit today because I had a very important meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
========================================================

To further complicate things, he calls a phone sex line and gets ensnared in an extortion shake down. Dean Trumbell (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is a Mattress Salesman in Utah who orchestrates the plot.

It is a very strange movie, but Barry finally confronts his problems with Lena, pudding, and the Mattress Man. For an Adam Sandler movie, it is quite empowering. Though he is not ready to ""give a concert of anything"" he does manage to make some music with his harmonium, and it meshes with the soundtrack in a most satisfying way.

----------------------
Barry: I have a love in my life. It makes me stronger than anything you can imagine.
===================================

Paul Thomas Anderson is quite a director. The 2002 'Punch-Drunk Love' was quite different than other things he's done, such as 'There Will Be Blood' which won the Oscar for Daniel Day-Lewis, and it is also quite different from anything else Adam Sandler has done, or probably will ever do again. It is a quirky and strange movie, but well worth watching.

---------------------------
Barry: I have to get more pudding for this trip to Hawaii. As I just said that out loud I realize it sounded a little strange but it's not.

1213381,5,B00000G02H,If you love Adam Sandler movies you probably won't like this one.  If you hate his movies and like something different then you will really appreciate this movie.

1213382,4,B00000G02H,"Three points of note:

1. The original (in both senses) soundtrack. Barry Egan (Sandler) has psychological problems. He's prone to paroxysms of destructive rage, sparked primarily by his seven domineering and dysfunctional sisters. But his issues are more complex than anger management. In my lay opinion, he seems to be too close to the bad end of the autistic spectrum: he often appears oblivious to, and overwhelmed by, everyday stimuli (such as meeting new people, especially women); he's emotionally and socially stunted (but in a way distinct from the typical Sandlerian manchild); and verbal communication isn't exactly his strong suit (except when intimidation is called for). So what has this got to do with the soundtrack? Well, it struck me that the percussive, layered, and sometimes cacophonous music that plays when we see things from Barry's perspective is meant to convey the blooming, buzzing confusion that he's experiencing. It's as if we can hear his inner chaos. At any rate, these conspicuous and distinctive tracks help bring atmosphere to the foreground of the film, which is a plus, because the story itself is nothing special; the magic of this film is in the execution, the details, the tone.

2. The cinematography. I am no expert, but Anderson clearly uses some cool and unusual shots and lenses. He also intersperses some colorful abstract art by frequent collaborator Jeremy Blake (R.I.P.). You'll have to see for yourself.

3. The descent into fantasy. The film starts off quirky but fundamentally realistic. Ayn Rand didn't write the dialogue, and no one makes a dwarf-tossing joke in the middle of a pitched battle over the moral fate of the world -- everyone acts like a real person, with real emotions, however eccentric. But once the love story takes off -- literally, to Hawaii -- no amount of chemistry can make up for the fact that we have no idea what Lena Leonard (Watson) sees in Barry. She's stable, successful, and has a British accent; he's crazy, strapped for cash (he's counting on a milking an overgenerous frequent flyer miles promotion -- based on a true story), and sounds like Adam Sandler. Yet she's really into him. Maybe this is just Anderson situating himself in the romantic comedy section (love at first sight), but still, there should be something, however implausible, behind the romance if he wants the audience to care. (Interestingly, maybe he doesn't: maybe he was that committed to style over substance; maybe he wanted to focus exclusively on Barry's emotions; maybe this was his way of satirizing the genre.) At any rate, viewers are free to form their own understandings of characters' motivations.",1216166400,2,2667,5.056818181818182
1213383,1,B00000G02H,I found Punch Drunk Love to be too bizarre and random and ultimately it was just so boring.  People keep saying what a great film this is and I just don't understand that sentiment.  I felt this was akin to staring at a blank wall for 2 hours.  How is that entertaining?,1212624000,2,270,4.153846153846154
1213384,4,B00000G02H,"Ever watch a movie or listen to a record and a certain opinion of it will develop but whether you hadn't gotten yet and it grows on you or if it was good or bad right from the start is kind of nagging you? Should you spend more time with it and see if it'll eventually be a favorite or you shouldn't bother since it was never your taste to begin with? It's that state of being on the fence is kind of how I feel about Paul Thomas Anderson movies since I will admit he is a talent but then there's stylistic choices or story things that completely nag me and with ""Punch-Drunk Love"", we get a film that does just as much things right when it's not doing things wrong yet you don't mind that much anyway.

Barry Egan works at a shop that sells novelty items including a strange take on a plunger or ""funger"" and is quite the easily irritable and awkward man. But 2 unexpected things happen in his life that can change him: a talk with a phone-sex operator who wants to extort him for his money as well as a new woman, Lena, who's quite attracted to him. Both events end up becoming huge catalysts for Barry's changing behavior which is quite erratic and filled with a bit of promise as well.

Anderson's previous films I've seen such as Magnolia and There Will Be Blood were these films that I'd absolutely love if it wasn't for things that got in the way. While I will excuse the frogs and fascination with milkshakes, there was often times where the film would do something and completely lose me. Maybe it's too long and it becomes a sort-of indulgent length, or the aforementioned frogs in Magnolia, or the score and the lack of a compelling narrative in There Will Be Blood. With Punch-Drunk Love, 2 things I wasn't into was the score and a couple of weird interludes. For the former, some of it fits such as swelling orchestral strings reminiscent of old romance movies but then there's these weird percussive or noise freakouts that became incredibly distracting. Then on occasion, weird colors and patterns would show up and it becomes a case of ""what are these for?"" Like frogs and milkshakes, they seem more like neat ideas for novelty value rather than essential storytelling devices.

However this is the least complex and ambitious of Anderson's work (I haven't seen Hard Eight yet) and as such, it actually works a lot better because of it. The characters are allowed to breathe and be in our attention a lot and let's the characters, particularly Barry, to develop over the course of the film. It's also more restrained as the long-as-hell Steadicam shots of Magnolia and Boogie Nights are played down and the film feels more accessible and easier to manage than complex stories about 10 different characters who know 10 different people. It's more stranger than the films Anderson has done but maybe that's why it's so charming; I have to admit on a couple of scenes, I actually smiled and felt almost moved.

One can't talk about Punch-Drunk Love without talking about Adam Sandler. While I felt he misfired in Reign Over Me, here he's actually quite surprising and you really get a feeling that with the right character, this guy can deliver. And while Emily Watson's Lena is a bit of a mystery (why does she not recoil and actually embrace his weirdness), she's quite good and it's easy to see why he'd start to like her. We have frequent Anderson players Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Luiz Guzman and 24's Mary-Lynn Rasjkub as Barry's rather manipulative, nosy sister.

Punch-Drunk Love is a smaller movie about Barry Egan, a business owner who sells novelty items such as stylized toilet plungers.  Everything about Barry Egan permeates with a kind of frustrating sadness.  His seven older sisters constantly insult him and his life is consistently portrayed as minimalist and disassociated.  He is a profoundly lonely man.  His bizarre social behavior is awkward but at times spirals into both perversion as well as intensely violent fits of rage.  All the while, he is portrayed as the film's protagonist. Anderson is especially delicate in making us understand his eccentricities as justifiable survival mechanisms within the paradigm of his uncomfortable past and nearly pathetic current life.  Anderson is careful not to mock or exploit Egan for his faults.

Who could play such a unique and intriguing character?  I have to admit, I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler's early comedies.  Especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Madison/dp/B0009X761E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Madison</a>&nbsp;and I don't care who knows about it.  I love the silly and stupid humor of Adam Sandler and I firmly believe it is what put him on the map.  But he was just a character in those early films and besides those films really are just a series of comedy sketches.  It would've made more sense if Billy Madison were placed into a CGI world, a cartoon, or a comic book in the first place.  He continued to be silly all along but his characters always carried this dark side that wasn't easy to pinpoint among the poop jokes and slap-stick.  He was almost like Adam West's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman/dp/B00005LOUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman</a>&nbsp;was in the old television show and how we see Batman now in Christopher Nolan's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-movies/dp/B00005JNJV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman movies</a>&nbsp;is how we see Adam Sandler in Punch-Drunk Love.  It is as if Billy Madison or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Gilmore/dp/B0009X760U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Gilmore</a>&nbsp;were snatched away from the unrealistic comedic worlds of those respective films and aggressively forced to exist in the real world, where every scene isn't necessarily working toward a punch-line.  Although, much of Barry Egan's behavior in the real world is, at least on the surface, not unlike the behavior of Madison and Gilmore.

The most amazing thing about the whole Sandler dynamic is that he can really act.  He stands toe-to-toe with Phillip Seymour Hoffman (an Anderson regular who happens to be an amazing actor) in my favorite scene of the movie, where these two angry idiots just scream back and forth at each other over the phone.  The scene makes their later encounter in person an amazing confrontation.  Every single scene Sandler is in we tend to feel for the people around him.  Knowing what his temper is capable of made me uncomfortable for the people who surround him but especially uncomfortable for Egan himself, who seemingly can't settle into his own skin.  He does seem to find some comfort around Lena (Emily Watson), whose relationship with Barry is really what the film is intent on seeing through.

Punch-Drunk Love has a great style.  Anderson has a way of making ordinary scenes memorable and important scenes extraordinary. He is a also a great writer and makes even the smallest characters as strong as his leads.  The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/soundtrack/dp/B00006YXF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">soundtrack</a>&nbsp;is of course the perfect fit as well.  In the end and most important of all, Anderson tries hard to allow us the pleasure of watching Barry Egan bring some kind of comfort into his troubled life and I for one was surprised to enjoy it as much as I did.",1206403200,16,4824,6.50547730829421
1213386,5,B00000G02H,"It is beyond frustrating to listen to people talk about this movie as if they know what PTA's intentions were, or as if they secretly unlocked the mystery of the movie and the mystery of Sandler's and Watson's characters.  When we watch this movie, we are given an outsiders view of the characters and their motives.  We have no idea why Sandler is crazed and breaks his sister's husband's windows.  Nor do we understand why Watson enjoys Sandler's company and pretty much falls in love with him.  All of PTA's films have this theme and this constant mystery behind each character's relationship with one another.  In Boogie Nights, Julliane Moore's character falls in love with Wahlberg almost immediately, without any reason or any justification.  This is how the world of PTA works.

I think Punch Drunk love is a unique and truly sophisticated movie.  Yes, it is a character study and the plot is only the tail, and the dog is the character, but the visuals are undeniably the part of the movie that really stand out to me.  The ambiguity of the artwork that is shown between scenes almost alludes to blotched spots that a psychiatrist asks his/her patients to interpret during a therapy sessions.  PTA is almost acting as a psychiatrist to the viewer, making us interpret what this whole movie really means.  Additionally, PTA always does a fantastic job making the action in scenes come out in quick and LOUD spurts. The beginning of this movie is slow and very quiet, almost tip-toeing around, and then all of a sudden...BOOM, a car comes out from no where and flips over, and then the Harmonium is abandoned.  It creates a huge amount of tension for the viewer, almost making us anticipate that something horrible/exciting/unforeseeable  is going to happen very soon.

Additionally, PTA's use of color is phenomenal.  The way he makes the colors brighter than they really should be, making some scenes glare as if they are not in focus, furthers this theme of disorder and ambiguity.

All in all, I think people should give this movie a shot.  It is an experience and is unlike any movie that is out there, and very different from PTA's other movies.  I would say, however, that the movie that is most similar to Punch Drunk Love is There Will Be Blood.  The love theme is not present, obviously, but the pace, the visual beauty and the character development being the central theme is the same as Punch Drunk Love.  DDL and Sandler both run the show in both movies, and both do an excellent job keeping the viewer intrigued.

It's a love story, in one of the most unconventional ways.  Barry almost won't let himself love.  ANd it's a wonderful film watching him actually get there.

1213388,5,B00000G02H,"This is a great film and Paul Thomas Anderson's best film to date. His off beat approach to depicting life and people in awkward situations and how they deal with it is a joy to watch. It seems a given that films be assembled with care, but most films today are assembled as if one was piling up leaves in a yard. Very few film makers assemble their films with the care and attention to detail that Anderson obviously gives to each and every shot and scene. Camerawork, sound, audio, score, & soundtrack are all carefully assembled and used to create a unique work of art. This is a film. This symphony of varying elements composed together in harmony or disharmony all contribute to the beautiful result that is this film.

Synchronicity and the underlying power of the universe is used as a force that propels this film forward. Free will is also examined and together the two forces, whether at odds or in harmony help show how our lives are pushed and pulled by fate, internal and external forces, and perhaps pudding. The pudding story is true by the way. It was based on a real guy who discovered the exact mistake in marketing that Barry did in the film.

Adam Sandler delivers the finest performance of his career and takes a huge step away from schlock comedy. Anderson proves himself as one of the finest film makers alive today. I will be eagerly awaiting his next feature.",1191974400,,1384,4.554216867469879

As a diehard Sandler fan, I can safely say that when I saw this 'film' I decided it was time to stab my eyes out with a rusty fork.  Fortunately, someone nearby took pity on me and turned the DVD player off, sparing me my sanity and my eyesight.  Poor Sandler.  This must have been a hard blow; while he did great with what he was given for a script, the movie itself packed no PUNCH, blew chunks like a DRUNK, and I would LOVE to ask whoever's idea that was, ""Just what in the hell were you thinking?! How am I supposed to get that two wasted hours of my life back?!""",1189641600,4,628,4.1652892561983474
1213432,5,B00000G02H,"Paul Thomas Anderson is like Quentin Tarantino in the way that he's able to design his own world and the characters in it and convince you that this place might actually exist. He's taken us into the world of porn stars and into a town where frogs fall from the sky; Now he takes us into the world of ""Punch-Drunk Love"" the only Anderson movie I didn't enjoy upon my first viewing. I loved Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, and Magnolia immediately...But when I first saw ""Punch-Drunk Love"" I turned off my television with so many questions running through my head. Even as I write this, having now seen the film 5 times and loving it,
I still have questions.

Anderson's energetic, anxiety-filled, almost ADHD world doesn't seem realistic for a minute. His protagonist Barry Egan (played by Adam Sandler) is either odd, insane, or retarded. Anderson presents us with Barry but makes no judgment about him and leaves it to the audience to decide. Barry obviously has a lot of problems, but whether he's mentally disturbed or mentally challenged is never quite approached. In many moments, I wondered if maybe the events were just occurring in his head. I'll get to that in a moment.

The basic plot structure breaks down like this: Barry is a business owner who is enjoying a cup of coffee outside his wherehouse when there is a sudden car wreck and a taxi appears, dropping off a small piano. Barry takes it into the wherehouse and begins working on it. Meanwhile, he finds a marketing campaign with a big marketing error in it, that he begins using to his advantage. After Barry calls a phone-sex line, he finds himself being harassed by the girl he talked to...At the same time, he meets Lina (Emily Watson), who may be the girl of his dreams. We learn early on that Barry has extreme anger problems. He's got 7 sisters who continually, ceaselessly harass him. When he goes to a party with all 7 of them present, he ends up kicking in the sliding glass door...Which apparently he already did earlier in life with a hammer, although he frequently claims not to remember although it's obvious he does.

That's what makes Sandler's performance so brilliant. He completely buries himself in this character. While Barry has the same violent outbursts that we've seen come from Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Dave (from Anger Management); This is hardly the same Adam Sandler we've seen since SNL. Just like a person knows when their friend is lying or tired or getting angry, we sense when it's happening to Barry. This has to do with the combination of two things. Sandler's performance and the way Anderson directs the scenes. By the time Barry kicks in that sliding glass door, you're ready to kick in your television set. Anderson is amazingly skilled at creating a feeling of anxiety or anger for his audience. Since his films are either love it or hate it, this talent goes two ways. It either makes you FEEL the anxiety and anger of the character or it makes you act it out.

The big question about this film that still plagues me is whether this is all or mostly occurring in Barry's head. The car wreck scene in the beginning looks like a pretty serious wreck, but there's no sounds of anyone reacting and it doesn't seem like anyone points it out later. Later in the film, Barry rips a phone headset out of the base and appears in Utah with the phone still in his hand. Did he run to Utah? And back!!!??? This is not a structured plot at all; Much of it is meant to be taken metaphorically, so maybe what's actually happening and what's not is irrelevant. ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is a film that has grown on me. I hated it the first time around and love it now. It's a love story/dark comedy that strays far from convention is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.

Yes we all should know that when you think of Adam Sandler, you think comedy right away, so maybe that's why so many hardcore ""Happy Gilmore"" fans didn't ""get"" this film. They were probably too clouded with how Sandler played his dark, yet quirky characters roll. This movie is certainly not for everyone but I thought it was well written and directed. I admit it was a little slow at the start, but you soon got into the movie and the plot and that's what made it so entertaining to me.

I always felt there was a sadistic side to Sandler in a lot of his comedy, a love of being cruel and malicious to people.  Granted, many comedians are very angry people, but Sandler seems to have a vicious streak in him 3000 miles wide, and this is brought to the fore in Punch Drunk Love.  Sandler seems like he could lose it at any moment, with 7 annoying sisters and a horrid job.  I think we're supposed to find sympathy for Sandler, but we don't, because he isn't really a nice guy, but a guy who lets people walk all over him, and seems poised to take revenge by going on a shooting spree.  The film itself feels disjointed, and as many others have pointed out, one doesn't believe when the Emily Watson character falls in love with Adam's character.  She's relatively normal, and he is teetering on complete insanity.  If she had been a tad more insane, it may have worked.  Sandler's performance, while good, was not Oscar worthy (as critics were screaming ""Oscar buzz!  Oscar buzz!"").  This is an OK film that is really kind of a mess.

The ""disappointed"" were the Adam Sandler fans who expected another ""Happy Gilmore""-type character, the kind of goofball the comedian has built a career on portraying. Instead, they got a dark comedy/drama that was anything but the typical Sandler fare. They also got a weird story.

I had the advantage of knowing what to expect, and that helped a lot. Also, I guess I've watched too many movies because I am beginning to like some of these oddball films....and this one certainly qualifies as ""odd."" I thought the mixture of dark humor, drama, suspense and romance all made for a fascinating film. You just never knew what was coming next, something funny or something horrifying. This is definitely something different and I suspect one of those movies you'll either really like or really hate.

I supposed it helped I like Emily Watson, who is the female love interest in here. No one that nice would keep seeing a wacko like Sandler's character in here, but that's the movies for you. In most cases, you have to suspend your belief.

The storyline, whether pleasant or very unpleasant, got me involved and the camera-work in here was interesting, too. In summary, it's a curiosity piece for those who like something different. Just don't expect a happy, hilarious Happy Gilmore.",1145491200,6,1346,4.916299559471366
1213438,4,B00000G02H,"While I'm not a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson I do enjoy this film very much for more cinematic purposes and from the perspective of a director. If you're looking at this film because you love the goofy, lovable, jackass; Adam Sandler then you will be thoroughly disappointed. Adam Sandler becomes a completely different actor completely and surprises and shocks the audience by his acting capabilities. His performance will leave you uncomfortable, touched and enlightened. Emily Watson (as always) plays a lovable British sweetheart that is very interested in Adam Sandler's character. The two of them create a heart melting romance that changes and helps Adam Sandler's character through his struggles with life and being able to break barriers as a person.

The film starts out showing us the awkward and unorthodox life of Barry Egan (Sandler) and relationship with his: seven sisters, his business partner (played by Luis Guzman), and a conflict that he encounters with a phone sex-line company that threatens to send their gang of ""brothers"" lead by Academy Award Winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman when Barry refuses to pay them money. Barry is a quiet person that is rather anti-social and is embarrassed easily, he hides behind his lies and denial so that his girlfriend Lena Leonard (Emily Watson) doesn't think that he's a loser. But when the `brothers' begins to ask to hard and begins to cause Barry and Lena's relationship harm, Barry stands up for the woman he loves.

*""It is boring"" - Since when did loud, fast and outrageous become associated with boring? I don't care how slow something is. If it is different, innovative, and interesting, it is not boring. Your standard Michael Bay film is boring - this film is not.

*""The background of the characters was not fleshed out."" We hear Eagan's life story, get to meet his seven sisters, hear all his hopes and fears as admitted to his brother-in-law, and go through every neurotic detail of his life. The only way to this character could possibly be fleshed out more is if we saw him going to the bathroom.

*""Bad acting."" What these people are really saying is that they miss the low-brow roles traditionally played by Sandler (not that those roles aren't funny). Critics gave good reviews to Sandler's depth and Watson's portrayal. Sorry, but I put more faith in Ebert's evaluation of good acting than I do your typical fan of 50-cent movies or ""Dukes of Hazzard.""

Either way, it does not succeed in my book. I've loved PT Anderson's films up until this point, but with this one, it seemed like he was trying too hard to impress the audience and give them (us) something new. For me, it didn't work. It MAY have worked with a first time director trying to find his/her style, but not a vet who already has both a mainstream AND a cult following.

NOW
So this was a very early review I did when I was 17. I may have been a bit harsh on it back then. Perspectives change over time and some things aren't as bad as you remember them. For the record, I still don't care for this movie. I've gone from a 1 star to 2 star (maybe more 2.5) but I can understand why people will like this movie. It's certainly unique and not a typical romantic comedy. I give kudos to Adam Sandler for trying something different. Some of what I said when I first wrote this (which you can see below) I don't totally agree with anymore. I still think the chemistry between most of the actors isn't very good. I find it hard to believe Sandler is related to the actresses playing his sister (or to each other). The romance between Sandler and Watson is very awkward, which I'm sure was the point but it still didn't feel that convincing to me. I can say that Phillip Seymour Hoffman was terrific in his role (as usual, RIP). I'm gonna leave the original review on here as well because I just wanna show a difference between my thought process at 17 and now.

THEN
I think Adam Sandler can do drama. I've thought that since I watched the courtroom scene in Big Daddy. But this was just CRAP! There is nothing provocative about this movie, it doesn't even make sense. The acting is terrible, there is no chemistry between any of the actors (especially the leads Sandler and Emily Watson). You can't believe for a second that the sisters are related. The usually great Phillip Seymour Hoffman is awful. And, what is up with the tiny piano? That's the one part of the fillm that makes absolutley no sense. Sandler's character is just pathetic, and the way he lashes out, it's almost impossible to feel sorry for him. The diologue seems forced. Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the most overrated filmmakers in film history. People seem to think that if it doesn't make sense, but it has a known director, then it must be wonderful and provacative. IT'S NOT!!! Don't be stupid like other people, think and don't be fooled by this tripe.",1120003200,7,2216,4.36319612590799

Very cheesy, but the film made the outcome too predictable. As for Adam Sandler,  his Barry Egan character was just Sandler playing his typical brooding-dumb guy role (hence Mr Deeds, Waterboy etc.)  As viewers we're supposed to feel sympathy for Barry, but his pointless  rage-outbursts are merely amusing throughout the film.  One good example is a bathroom scene (if you've seen the film you'll know what I'm talking about). Emily Watson & Luiz Guzman were okay in their respective roles.  Most of the film deals w/ Barry's conflicts, one being of a useless subplot involving a phone-sex line ran out of a Mattress store (owned by Philip Seymour Hoffman).*****Is it just me, or was Hoffman really unconvincing as the villain of the film?.........PT Anderson's  unique style was present in the film ( a plus).....I just did not love the film whatsoever..............hopefully my review helps future viewers of PUNCH DRUNK LOVE",1113696000,,1100,5.0054945054945055

When I heard Sandler was supposed to be a romantic lead in an Anderson film, I had my doubts, but I shouldn't have. Although this film is far from perfect, its abundant charms lie in its infinite quirkiness, including its cast of characters, like Sandler's Barry Egan. Barry is a businessman who, lonely, calls a phone sex chatline and ends up becoming the target of violent attacks and extortion once he has given up his credit card number to the phone sex operator. Behind the whole phone sex line operation is Philip Seymour Hoffman as a sleazy ""mattress king"", and Hoffman makes the guy believable.

Adam gives the performance of his career as a frustrated individual who just can't seem to fit in and cope with life's situations- especially when it comes to women and relationships.  He is as confused with his own actions, thoughts and emotions, as he is with complete strangers. The direction and music compliment eachother well, enhancing the paranoid state of the protagonist.

Each time I watch this movie I can't help but feel as though I have stepped into the shoes of Adam Sandler's character and accompany him on this roller coaster ride of emotional shambles.  Unlike the statements of a couple negative reviews, I find that the dialogue was fresh, funny and very realistic.

This is a complex character study that offers a ton of fun if you don't cling too tightly to conventional movie making.  I admit that I was looking, or waiting, for a moment that never came - but I am not entirely sure what it was I was expecting.  However, that disappointment only came during the first viewing I had of this movie.  On the second viewing, I knew the story and could just enjoy it for what it was... a quirky, funny glimpse into the life of a unique kind of love.  I can honestly say that I believe this movie is perfect just as it is.

This is punch-drunk love in its highest form... the story of two people in love who are completely consumed in their feelings and it is absolutely amazing to watch.  Nothing would tear these two apart.  Can't help but think that they have something that most people do not - passion, no matter how strange and kooky.  This movie gives hope to those who feel love will never find them... there truly is a person for everybody - and this movie celebrates that with a ton of energy and enthusiasm.",1110758400,2,1797,4.526315789473684

Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the detestable furnature king torturing Barry. Hoffman is both intimadating and funny and Luis Guzman is utterly likable as Barry's sidekick at work.

You do not put forth an amazing acting job simply because you do not do what you normally do.

In Other Words

This isn't amazing acting by Adam Sandler

This roles simply asked of him not to act like an idiot for less than 2 hours.

Im not a huge fan of Sandler but some of his movies do make me laugh.

In this film he is believable as a bland dim witted simple man

This DOESN'T mean his acting was unbelievable!

Acting is creating a character with multiple dimensions and ranges in which to engross an audience and make the person believable

Same goes for Bill Murray

Im a huge fan of Murray but just because he wasn't trying to be hilarious or silly in LOST IN TRANSLATION, doesn't mean he simply will be handed an Oscar. His facial expression during the awards were such that he actually expected to win. Your hysterical Bill, and your acting was controlled and fine. But you were NOT amazing.

In my mind Anderson is more successful here for this smaller project than he was in ""Magnolia"".  Another interesting choice of Anderson's is the casting of Adam Sandler as the neurotic novelty plunger salesman, Barry Egan.  I have always been ambivalent about the talents of Sandler, though I have enjoyed some of his vehicles(""Happy Gilmore"", ""The Wedding Singer"", ""Anger Management"").  Anderson must have seen something in Sandler because he is precisely right for the part.  At the center of the film is the unlikely love story between Sandler and Emily Watson.  Normally, you would say this is unbelievable.  But the gyst of Anderson's film is that love is possible despite ourselves.  To the credit of Watson, we wholeheartedly believe that she could fall for this head case.  Other comic vignettes in the film involve Barry's obsession with obtaining frequent flyer mileage by purchasing $2,000.00 worth of pudding.  Another amusing comic sidelight involves Egan being extorted by Mormon phone sex purveyors.

It's wonderfully weird.  Adam Sandler is literally at his best in this film.  You start to believe so heavily in his social phobia that you have to be sympathetic.  He and Emily Watson are such a great match (as far as their characters go) that I applaud the casting director for making such a bold move.

Basically, Barry (Adam Sandler) has a bunch of over-bearing sisters who'd like to run his life, so it's made him very quirky in his handling of social situations.  He calls a phone sex line one day and naively gives them his credit card number.  They start to bribe him and basically ruin his life, and normally he would just sit down and take it.  But since he has found a new love (Emily Watson), it gives him the strength of assertion.

Every single person I ever asked about this movie said it was terrible and weird.  Against the advice of many customers and friends, I blindly bought ""Punch Drunk Love.""  After finishing it, all I could say was ""Wow...that was amazing.""

Adam Sandler's portrayal of Barry Egan was flawless.  The progression of emotions in this movie kept me wanting more.  ""Punch Drunk Love"" did something for me that a movie hasn't done in a long time:  it made me feel something.  It made me feel uncomfortable, but not bad uncomfortable.  The way it was shot, the music, and the effects made me feel what emotions Barry felt every step of the way. I also think this has one of the best fight scenes ever captured on film.  It was so simplistic, but at the same time, more beautiful and powerful than any other fight scene I have seen.  So much so that I had to rewind it immediately and watch it four more times.

'Punch Drunk Love' is the story of a 'normal neurotic' who's life is just giving him lemons (and he doesn't really know how to make lemonade). Some parts of this film are just so darkly funny that laughing aloud seems the only solution. Seven tauntingly loudmouthed sisters, unrelenting phone pornographers, and utter stupidity are just some of Barry Egan's problems.

When something finally goes right in his life, finding Lena, something far worse happens.

I didn't find this movie highly symbolic, which is a common trait of many independent or art-house films, but it is a wonderful dark comedy. I only hope to see Sandler in more provocative movies like this in the future.",1092960000,2,841,4.793103448275862
1213632,5,B00000G02H,"Right off, I want to say that I'm a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson. Boogie Nights and Magnolia are two of the best ensemble pieces I've ever seen. Needless to say, I was quite surprised when I heard that he'd done a small picture, a love story, and that it starred Adam Sandler. But that was only the beginning of the surprises, as I soon found out...
Sandler plays Barry Egan, a quiet, lonely guy who is experiencing a degree of emotional angst about life. He's trying to make his business prosper, dealing with seven nagging sisters (all of whom badger him relentlessly about life, love, etc...), and yet finds himself swinging from sobbing uncontrollably to abject rage from time to time, with no apparent reason. In a lonely moment, he indulges in a phone-sex scam with unfortunate consequences. He's also buying up lots of groceries in an attempt to gain a million free air miles and meanwhile, a romance is blossoming with Lena (Emily Watson), a friend of one of his sisters. With me so far?
The real beauty of this film is in its imagery and simplicity. Barry and Lena are imperfect people trying to connect in an imperfect world. Anderson gives an amazing amount of trust to the actors to portray these people honestly, and it works wonderfully. They are able to convey a universe of emotion with very few words, and the connection seems so real, so tangible, that just watching them is almost like falling in love. The use of music, always excellent in Anderson's films, is just as perfect here and I have to say, the scene in which Barry and Lena walk down a hotel hallway in Hawaii with the song Maui Chimes playing quietly in the background, as he takes her hand and the camera irises in on their hands as they round a corner is quite possibly the sweetest love scene I've never seen. An earlier scene in which the two meet in the same hotel is done all in silhouette, and the effect is brilliant and beautiful. I'm getting all teary-eyed just thinking about it.
Luis Guzman and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, two of Anderson's stock cast of actors, as usual, turn in great performances and it makes me happy to see that Anderson appreciates the quality of these actors as much as many of us do. And though it appears that Sandler has returned to his more familiar genre of movies, he shows us that he really does have the chops to play serious, character-driven roles and with luck, we'll see more performances of this caliber from him in the future.",1088726400,4,2459,4.5656108597285066

Others were so turned off by the random violence in the movie. All these things led the weak-minded and easily swayed film-goers to either miss the film completely, or paint it the wrong color.
Punch-drunk Love is a perfect exhibition of romance between two people who aren't normal. Not abnormal retarded abnormal, or mentally ill and crippled abnormal; just not like everyone else. What people did not see in this movie was the source of Barry Egan's (Sandler) frustration: it was his sisters that were crazy and it was them who drove him to utter frustration! His random acts of violence were the result of the boiling points his sisters constantly pushed him to. The rest of the movie let the viewer watch Barry reconcile the life everyone told him to live, the life he was living, and the life he wanted to live (and who he wanted to live with).
There were very light moments to counter balance the emotional, very subtle jokes, and an exhibition of great acting. Adam Sandler proved that he can conceive and portray multi-dimensional characters.

I have most of Billy Madison comitted to memory, and I still laugh long and hard when Happy Gilmore fights Bob Barker.
It is funny though how closely related Barry Egan is to some of Sandler's own characters.  He is fundamentally insecure and prone to violence.
The fact that film is so unlike any of Sandler's previous work ought to be enough to dissuade anyone looking for a silly comedy to not bother, and to just watch Billy Madison over again.

He's constantly mocked by them & that, he's rendered as their public entity.  Once in a while, he would go for a rage rampage.  One fateful evening, he called a sex-line only to be extorted by the man behind the operation.  A man who runs a matress & bed shop right in the heart of Mormon land, Utah!

My wife could not stay awake through he film and just said it was boring, and I tended to agree with her.

Anderson uses some filming techniques that do not really add anything to the film for me. he likes to experiment with colors and scenes are separated by Scopitones, I could have done without both. I think Anderson could have worked a little more on the story than on visual feel.  The way a movie looks can add to it greatly, but when it becomes obvious that the filmmaker seems to be sacrificing story and character development for artistic creation with a camera, the movie suffers.
About the DVD: On the extra disc you get a special called Blossoms and Blood, which may as well be called Deleted Scenes. With extra artwork, three theatrical trailers and actual deleted scenes, the extras on the DVD flesh out the characters a little more making the actual film a little more enjoyable, but not much. However, true to PT Anderson's history, this DVD is missing a commentary track.  It would be nice to see PT's thought process.

1213639,2,B00000G02H,"I loved HARD EIGHT, admired the craft of BOOGIE NIGHTS, and regarded MAGNOLIA as one of the best films of the past decade.  P.T. Anderson has established an enviable track record.  But Adam Sandler--though slightly less repugnant than Jim Carrey--has not generally impressed me as someone I would choose to spend even 30 seconds watching.  (I have teenaged sons, thus have seen a few of his movies.)  Yet I did enjoy his performance in THE WEDDING SINGER, in which he demonstrated the ability to portray a human being instead of an obnoxious boor.  And ever since BREAKING THE WAVES Emily Watson has been one of my favorite actresses, always turning in strong & often extraordinary performances.  But still there was Sandler....
Sufficiently skeptical to avoid this film in the theatres, and not even to hasten to see it on video, I nevertheless hoped it would overcome the handicap of Sandler and equal the quality standard established by P.T. Anderson's previous films.  Having seen it described as a ""romantic comedy,"" I hoped for something like MAGNOLIA MEETS THE WEDDING SINGER.  Boy was I surprised!
Sandler is not the problem.  But watching him--or rather his character, Barry--is excruciating.  Barry may be the most pathetically screwed-up character a filmmaker has ever asked his audience to identify with (Paddy Chavesky's MARTY is a winner compared to Barry).  Everything he does is excruciatingly painful and stupid, from his job, to his pudding-for-free-airmiles scam, to his phone-sex nightmare, to trashing the restaurant restroom (oh, THAT Adam Sandler)--and the pain implicit in each of these episodes is intensified by a soundtrack like fingernails on a chalkboard.  By the time he finally makes an honest choice that leads to redemption, it's too little too late to save a film mired in its own excess.
The problem is Anderson.  Like Sophia Coppola, he seems ignorant of the imitative fallacy in art.  And what could have been an unusual and arresting contemporary ""love"" story has become a painful exercise in audience endurance instead.  Two stars for the beautiful Frankenthalerish images behind the credits and interspersed at times between scenes throughout the film.",1077321600,2,2192,5.1875

A major detour for Adam Sandler, as he plays a serious character, and does so admirably.  He plays a weird socially-awkward guy whose life seems sad and meaningless until he meets a woman with similar weirdnesses to his.

I'm sorry, Adam Sandler films have become so trite that when I see a commerical for yet another Adam Sandler movie *yawn* they go in one ear and out the other.  However, this was an exception.  ""Punch-Drunk Love"" was the film that made the audience turn the other cheek.  Hmm, now I'm getting interested.

The lack of a screenplay (which may or may not be all improvised - it isn't known) also strangely creates a sense of the most pretentious art film but there's no substance in the excercize - just a one-note joke. ""Plot points"" if you can call them that in this films show complete disregard for storytelling, a loss for story is also filled up with several minutes of color effects - apparently to get the movie to 90 minutes (the first time it did get some laughs, after that it gets old).
All in all it shows the humor in pretention but at the same time I think it could have been a 5 minute Saturday Night Live skit with a much stronger affect. Was P.T.A. making fun of bad art films or finding the humor in the classic ones? A good joke shouldn't take an hour and a half. Skip it - or watch it while you're doing chores or something. Paul Thomas Anderson is simply the most overrated and misplaced person in the film industry (Kevin Smith is a close 2nd but at least less money gets dumped into his projects). A shame and a waste of film, time and energy when there are so many other artists out there struggling to have their voice be heard.

In Brief
Punch Drunk Love tells the story of Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), a small business owner who has an eye for the small things in life.  Egan has seven sisters whose constant ridicule of their brother keep him alone, somewhat unbalanced and unable to fall in love.  That is until one day when a mysterious woman (Emily Watson) enters his life leading him upon a romantic and twisted journey.
Review
The genesis of Punch Drunk Love came two years ago, when Paul Thomas Anderson came across a Time magazine article about David Phillips, a University of California civil engineer who stumbled upon a lucrative frequent-flyer promotion.  Like Egan he became known to the entire airline industry as the Pudding Guy as Phillips had accumulated 1.25 million air-miles by purchasing 12,150 cups of Healthy Choice pudding for a mere $3000.  It may seem a peculiar basis but Anderson optioned Phillips' story and wrote the film specifically with Sandler in mind.
Egan lives within himself, a fantasy world if you will, that is accentuated and highlighted by the Rainbow coloured cuts that institute a new era of each narrative act.  As you watch this film, one feels that they are literally looking out upon everything from his perspective, and can feel his frustration as both camera and sound exemplify this out of body experience throughout.  Indeed as this world that he so badly wants to be a part of pushes him to the point of rage the amplification of the slightest sound that we hear seems to justify any action or indeed inaction that he takes.
Like the opening car crash that bears little relation or obvious consequence, Eagan is man looking for a reason for being.  Frustrated by the bullying of his sisters, he is on a road to destruction in which no one cares how hard he will hit the wall at the end.  Sandler, unlike many of his films prior to this point, truly shows here that he can meet that standard when the bar is raised.  He is the real Rainman: a man held back by the implication and constraints of normal living as he beautifully creates a sincere, honest and poignantly funny portrayal of a man lost in himself.
At the start of the story an old organ is discarded in the street before Egan's full view.  Uncertain at first he collects it and hesitantly proceeds to tinker and fix it, in much the same way that the understated performance of Watson brings him out of himself and nurtures him into bloom.  Though it may sound soppy, nothing is ever clear sailing and this quirky tale spins and loops in such a way that will keep you gripped to the end.
The Verdict
Sandler, Watson and indeed the dastardly performance by Hoffman along with a fine supporting cast provide a perfect ensemble to this slice of a magnified focus upon the small things in life.  Most people do not notice the world in which they live, and like the Pudding Guy you should follow his lead and make sure you absorb every facet of this beautifully quirky film.",1073433600,2,3015,4.6360225140712945
1213670,5,B00000G02H,"PDL was a surprise in that I expected an Adam Sandler film to be silly and contrived.  But, based on some good reviews, I checked it out and was amazed at the quality and vibrance of this film.  From the beginning it drew you in and you became a voyeur in the life of Sandler's ""Barry"", discovering the nervous and ungracious aspects of his life right away.  The car crash at the beginning came totally out of the blue and upon rewinding and studying the scene in slow-mo, it seemed that the stunt was partially animated, which gave it a grace of movement along with a spectacular effect.  It went unexplained, however, and the next thing to happen was the truck dropping off the harmonium in a great cloud of dust.  Barry doesn't speak for quite a few minutes into the film, and yet so much has happened to him already before he begins his workday.  He is a businessman, a would-be entrepreneur, verging on success, but you are never shown what it is he sells or distributes, except for the constantly breaking items and forklifts spilling contents of things in the background.
So here is a life - frustrated and without scope. Enter the girl, Emily Watson who focuses on Barry and involves him in her life right away by giving him her car keys and leaving her car near his warehouse. No explanations that make sense - but it is all delightfully enetertaining.
I loved the movie and the art, sound and music. But mostly I adored Adam Sandler's brilliant portrayal of a character that became an icon as vivid as Dustin Hoffman's ""Graduate"".
As was mentioned in a review before, if you loved ""Vanilla Sky"" you will love PDL.  Well, that got me going! VS was my favorite movie in 2003 until PDL.  Both movies I can watch again and again.
I appreciated all the good reviews and had to laugh at most of the bad ones. If I hated a movie I wouldn't bother reviewing it at all, but some people are bent on letting the world know their opinion in this great free forum called Amazon.com.",1072915200,,1979,4.462603878116344

The dialog is pointless and takes you nowhere fast. Do yourself a favor and watch something redeeming like Legend of 1900 or Tortilla Soup. You'll feel much better about yourself and your 2 hours will have been well spent. Go back to SNL Adam that is were you belong.",1072396800,8,421,4.023809523809524
1213746,3,B00000G02H,"Usually when I think about a particular movie and try to arrive at some kind of conclusion about it, I tend to end up saying that it's either ""good"", or bad, in some final, ultimate sense. A movie is either worth seeing or isn't; it either has something interesting to say or hasn't. Of course, even worse than movies that ultimately have nothing to say are pretentious films that pretend to have some such thing.
That much being said, I'd like to state first that probably no movie has ever left me so confused as to its true identity as a good or bad film experience, as ""Punch-Drunk Love"".
Everyone who saw it told me it was stupid; some just said it was horrible. A friend of mine who has seen a lot of movies and whose judgment in these matters I trust said that he had tried to keep
an open mind throughout the whole movie - but that by the end he felt like the director's whole intention was just to have him sitting there scratching his head, and he left disappointed. In the first place, when I had first heard that the new P.T. Anderson movie was going to have Adam Sandler in it, I thought ""Wow, that's going to be really painful."" But ""Magnolia"" was and is one of my favorite movies, and most importantly, Emily Watson was playing alongside the protagonist. I figured that even if it was really bad, the sheer novelty of seeing an actress like Emily Watson rattling off some horrible script would be worth seeing.
Well, what can one say? It succeeds at being a good and a bad movie at the same time. I think I'm convinced that this was Anderson's mission. This movie has some great, beautiful moments. The initial party scene where Barry kicks out a glass door; he ends up confiding to his brother-in-law in the laundry room: ""Sometimes I cry a lot..."" Whether it's Sandler or Anderson who should get the credit for that scene, it's pure genius. The score by Jon Brion seems to follow Barry everywhere he goes, and it works to great effect. The writing is genius in so many places. Agains, towards the end of the movie, when Barry has cracked and flown to Hawaii just to see this chick he hardly knows: he doesn't become a good guy, he explodes on his sister over the phone ""I'm not gonna take this !@#$ing *&^% anymore you %$#@...!""
Again, a great scene, prefectly filmed.
The only problem is...this movie is bipolar or something. It can't decide whether it wants to please or not. I won't give away anything, but I feel obligated to inform people of the ungodly pretentiousness running rampant throughout this film. There are incredible scenes like the ones I mentioned, but there are also scenes where I swear to God the movie is actually making fun of itself and the director is trying to insult his audience directly.

But just because you didn't get your tired, old, cheesy jokes and predictable storylines doesn't mean you should give this movie a bad rating or ""hate"" it.

This is a film for the emotionally inept by the emotionally inept, something that an uncultured cretin such as you would never be able to understand, who merely indulges themselves in their endeavours of superficiality and can't even string sentences with words containing more than three syllables together. And what do you mean ""how can you find someone saying i wanna smash your face in with a hammer erotic?"" You. Are. An. Idiot. It's about the fact that these two people understand each other and that they are so confident in their love for each other that they can actually feel free to exist with each other freely expressing their very, very strange and endearingly odd feelings with each other. Its about two outcasts coming together. And what do you mean ""what is the harmonium all about""! I cant believe that some people haven't heard of symbolism or metaphors. Did you go to school? I feel that it represents something coming into your life unexpectedly, and if you take the time to learn to play with it and take care of it and rely on it, it can create something......beautiful, just like with Barry (the protagonist) and Lena (the love interest). And the blue suit? If you watch the colour scheme of many of the backgrounds throughout the movie (e.g. the supermarket and his office) you'll see that they are also blue and white. This is to show Barry's desire to fit in and be considered normal with his surroundings. But of course the way he interprets how to do this just makes him seem even stranger i.e. turning up to work in an electric blue suit.

I found nothing comical about it... it started out fine but the constant drumming sounds and the horrid plot were enough to drive anyone to insanity.

1213820,5,B00000G02H,"For those who are familiar with Adam Sandler's other movies, Punch Drunk love is a reality check. Imagine, if you will, that you actually knew someone like Billy Madison or the Waterboy; that you actually had him as a neighbor or a co-worker. Chances are, against the backdrop of real life, you would find him weird, pathetic, maybe even a little annoying.
That is who Barry Egan is. The protagonist of Punch Drunk Love is every lovable loser Sandler has ever played, except that here, no one actually finds him lovable until one day when two things suddenly drop into his life: a gramaphone and a girl named Lena. And he finds love and true happiness because of these two things.
Punch Drunk Love is a bizarre story. It is funny in the same way the movies Adaptation and Being John Malkovich and Wonder Boys were funny, which means it has a sad kind of comedy. The humor is found in the strange things that loneliness drives Barry to do; the scene where he calls the phone sex line is so awkward that it is hilarious. Philip Seymour Hoffman steals most of the laughs from Sandler in his role as the man who runs the phone sex service; Sandler provokes the tears instead. Emily Watson shows an almost maternal affection in her performance as Lena, and she is wonderful. Luis Guzman is very likable as Barry's assistant Lance, but the best supporting performances go to the actresses who play Barry's seven sisters. They are wicked and abusive without ever seeming to recognize that abnormality of their behavior.
Punch Drunk Love is the only movie that I still laugh out loud and cry repeatedly every time I watch it, and though it is not for everyone, it is truly a work of cinematic art.",1067904000,5,1689,4.577557755775578
1213821,4,B00000G02H,"""You've gotta hope that there's someone for you,
As strange as you are.
Who can cope with the things that you do,
Without trying to hard.""
-- songwriter/composer, Jon Brion, ""Here We Go""
The best thing about this movie is that it's one of the ten best movies of the year.
The worst thing about this movie is that most people won't understand why it stands on a pedestal of such greatness, much less understand or identify with the emotionally tortured character played by Adam Sandler. Mostly, they won't get why Sandler isn't talking with a goofy-voice, performing outrageous slapstick, or chasing non-existent penguins around a swimming pool.
That's because Sandler is showing that, perhaps, under his puckish exterior, he has some valid talent. Declaring this performance an Oscar-winner may be jumping the gun just a bit...but it's damn close.
Sandler plays a lonely little man who is constantly dressed in a blue suit with a white shirt and orange tie. When asked why he's dressed so formal by his friend and co-worker (Luis Guzman), his answer is simple: ""I felt like dressing up."" He's perfectly ready to be defensive when he has to be and his body-language shows he's on guard...even though he runs the place he works at.
Such is the life of one Barry Egan, a man who does his best to have a great career and a good life. So what is his problem? Underneath it all, Egan is a ticking time-bomb waiting to explode. He lives alone, craves female companionship (but unleashes his sexual frustrations on phone-sex workers who cannot see who or what he is), and is always looking to one-up his overbearing family...all female and all his sisters. He's a mess.
One of his sisters constantly reminds him of his inability to stand up for himself:
""Remember when we called you 'gay-boy'? You used to get so mad!""
Yes, so mad indeed. Egan ends up destroying the plate-glass inside a sliding-glass door during a birthday party thrown by his sisters, kicking it into tiny shards and then tries to talk to one of his brother-in-laws about the incident. All goes well until Barry is reminded that his brother-in-law is a doctor...but his degree is in dentistry.
Such is the life of one Barry Egan.
Perhaps this is why he can't find the perfect female companion to be with: his fear and hatred of the same women that drove him crazy at an early age.
Strangely enough, Barry is introduced to Lena (Emily Watson), a woman who may just understand his psychosis and be able to work with it. Ironically enough, Barry is given this opportunity by one of his witchy sisters who even has the audacity to tear him apart in front of Lena with several questions:
""Why are you collecting all those pudding cups? Why do you have a piano on your desk? Why can't you come have some food with us? What is going on? Are you okay?""
The answers come slowly but surely as Lena begins to date Barry and together, the two of them begin a journey into an unknown land where nothing is for sure.
That's where the movie does a complete 180. This isn't your normal romantic comedy. Given the circumstances, the build-up, and the characters, the film is quite wonderfully different. It's dreamlike, surreal, and just quirky. It wasn't made from the same tired formula used to spit out a million droning Meg Ryan romantic-comedies. This is truly an original piece of work and should be judged as such. Forget what you know about romantic comedies even though you have seen so many. This is a filmic poem for those who are afraid to come out of their shell for fear of rejection and judgement.
It TRULY makes you believe that you can be loved no matter who or what you are.
The score accents the feeling of the movie. Jon Brion's main theme swells with warmth and beauty. Hell, Shelley Duvall's famous ""He Needs Me"" is worked into the score and many will say it doesn't fit within the frame of the picture. I tend to disagree. It fits because it describes what the character is feeling. It's quirky and sung in an longingly out-of-tune manner, not only capturing the hopelessness of Barry Egan but his hopefulness as well. Brilliant use of music.
Kudos to director Paul Thomas Anderson for scoring another hit.

1213863,3,B00000G02H,"So, firstly, I guess I should say that I did like this movie, but at the same time I think it's overrated, like most classy respected films are. I like that it kept me interested in what was going to happen to Barry next. It was a good character study, the way the various aspects of his character came out, and fit together to make an interesting, if somewhat unrealistic, person.
I don't know what the car flipping over at the start was about. I guess I'll just have to chalk it up to pointless surrealist imagery. And if the harmonium, as another reviewer said, existed just for his learning to play to provide a metaphor for his learning to live and love, I find that a bit trite.
The love story element didn't do a lot for me. The couple of parts that made me smile were the girl's naive awkward expressions of honesty. When she was all forward asking him out, and then calling him back up to her room from the lobby to kiss him, but those kind of things aren't too far removed from standard romantic comedy fare, just with a less flowery tone. So yeah, that's basically what I think about the film as a whole, the parts that are successful aren't particularly artistic, and the parts that do lean into arty territory are a bit trite and only served to alienate me from the plot/characters.
The other central plotline, the phone sex scam, was done well and evolved nicely. Like Barry's character evolution it was engaging and kept me interested in what would happen next. But when it ended with him defeating the scammers because of the strength love had given him, it was, again, trite. That part of the plot had until that point evolved in a believable realistic manner, then the rules are just flipped and that part of the plot exists solely as a cartoonish backdrop for him to demonstrate the power of love upon. The conslusion and closure I had been anticipating were basically dismissed.
The whole film ends rather abruptly too. Apparetly they were in love so there's the happy ending, film over. I really didn't buy them as in love. The few words they had exchanged during their meetings and dates really left them as little more than strangers to each other in my eyes. I can buy them having passion for each other, but there was no genuine bond or understanding developed between the two that I saw. Certainly nothing to sum up the film as.",1066521600,,2354,4.489510489510489
1213864,4,B00000G02H,"Adam Sandler is surprisingly very effective in a more serious and laidback role. It's totally different than anything else he has done before and I wouldn't mind seeing him in more serious roles like this. He plays a easygoing nice guy with 7 sisiters who treat him like crap. One of them  introduces him to a friend of there's played by Emily Watson. She wants to date him despite his sister trying to make her  think he's nuts. They date and after a goodnight kiss he wants to see her more.
  There's also a subplot where some guys are after him because he called a scamming phone sex number just to talk because he was lonely. The women he talks to keeps calling him asking for money and threatens him since she has all his information. His character unlike all his other ones has a bad tempter hidden inside him and when he's pushed too hard...look out. When he's mad in this it's actually scary although u can't help laughing too. Sandler is excellent and his scenes with Watson are sweet and funny. They have good chemestry too.

1213866,5,B00000G02H,"Paul Thomas Anderson won the best director award in 2002 at the Cannes Film Festival for this little gem.  Jon Brion who did sound on two of Anderson's other films, ""Magnolia"" and ""Hard Eight,"" is certainly almost another character with a score whose emphasis on dissonance and percussion mirror the quirky and haunting world of Barry Egan.  Anderson's film is somewhat expressionistic in its use of sound that is bold & effective.
One might wonder how someone as wonderfully naive as Barry is able to run a business; but it is the stark normalcy of the spacious empty warehouse setting that contrasts the unusual events and cluttered emotions of Barry's inner life.  There are no frogs dropping from the sky like in ""Magnolia,"" but there is a harmonium that is mysteriously dropped off at the end of the alley after a rolling car crash.  We see Barry presented with an instrument, but unable to play well which mirrors his lack of ability to find joy and happiness.  Luis Guzman who was in ""Count of Monte Cristo"" does a nice job as Barry's foreman, anchoring the movie's sense of reality.
Adam Sandler does an amazing job of being a completely repressed guy who continually wears a bright blue suit and then turns around and puts his fist through a glass door at his sister's house.  He seeks therapy advice from his dentist brother-in-law who then blabs all about it to the whole family, totally humiliating Barry.  This character's world is so unsatisfying and his behavior so naive, that it is believable he'd call a phone porn number just to have a chat.  It's never entirely clear why Lena Leonard played by the marvelous Emily Watson is attracted to Barry.  The great moral of the picture that when we have love in our lives we become stronger than anyone could possibly imagine is shouted at Philip Seymour Hoffman in the mattress shop.  And that's what this movie is about; and it is enough.
Along with Jon Brion's score, the visual rainbow elements make this as much an art film as a commercial venture.  We see repeated themes of hallways and corridors throughout which give the movie a sense of transition.  ""Punch Drunk Love"" has a unique artistic vision that is ultimately rewarding.

I actually really enjoyed Sandler's offbeat character, and the story (particularly the love story portion of it) was very interesting, as strange as it was.
That being said, I have a question for anybody that saw it in the theater. At the end when Sandler confronts Philip Seymour Hoffman in the furniture store, did he passively walk away after confronting him, or did he smash the store up? Now, my friend and I rented it from Blockbuster, and they are notorious for editing their movies (I am not sure how they can get away with this, but another friend bought Taxi Driver from them and it had much of the violence removed, and the Mulholland Drive I purchased from them actually blurred specific areas during a nude scene). In the version of PDL we rented, Sandler confronts Hoffman, and then quietly leaves the store, but my friend insists that in the theater Sandler acted much more violently. If anybody can shed some light on this, I would greatly appreciate it, and I can be reached at Chewms5@hotmail.com. Thank you.",1065052800,3,1290,4.687224669603524

in large part this was due to the musical score.  at times, it was difficult to hear the dialog because the music was competing with the dialog for attention, and competing in volume.  it was NOT like many movies, which simply drive you crazy because they have no clue how to create the soundtrack and you have to keep turning the volume up and down, first to hear the voices, and then to not go deaf when the music or the explosions start.  in this movie, the effect was obviously intentional.  and it adds such a tension to the places where sandler is being tense that you simply have to smile and enjoy it.
the choice of music is incredible as well.  who would think that shelly duval's singing from Popeye would be a wonderful and compelling metronome to sandler's character development and love affair.  apparently the director did.  and it is really a lovely series of scenes.

I do like the film a lot, to be sure, but I don't get angry when people says ""it sucks."" Usually then I ask them why they think so, and they say something like ""I don't know, it just does."" A few try to sound intelligent and say the classic ""It didn't mean anything."" Usually they are fans of other Sandler movies like Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy, so I ask them ""What is the meaning of Billy Madison?"" Gets them every time :). I don't mind that people don't like this movie or even hate it; there are many good reviews here  (usually the 2-3 star ones) that express their reasons rationally and bring up some good points as to why they don't like it. But I find the great majority of the 1-star reviews to be exceptionally funny, in a sad sort of way. Here are just a few of the retarded and hilarious things people have said so far about PDL (the spelling and grammar errors are theirs):
""contained many not-needed curse words"" (boo-hoo)
""no real plot"" (like other Sandler movies do?)
""horrible script""
""no amazing story"" (lol)
""Emily Watson is terrible (try Hilary and Jackie or Breaking the Waves)
""the direction is pretty weird""
""there really was no need for the MANY sisters to even be in the story"" (I'm not even going to bother to explain this one)
""the violence is not enjoyable""
""Hey Barry, how about a costume change?""
""Why was Barry the way he was?""
""savant like even"" (what the hell does this mean?)
""The pudding/frequent flyer miles subplot was suffocating, bland, and ignorant!""
""If you like you're typical Sandler flicks like I do, don't waste your money on this one, he did not write produce, or have anything to do with it other than acting in it. All in all it SUX"" (isn't him only acting in a movie a good thing, really? Master of the pen he is not).
""poorly presented story with pitiful personas""
""in a terrible and dangerous setting""
""...or even modern classics like Sleepless in Seattle...not the harsh realities found in an inner city with emotionally disturbed people"" (Wow. Just wow).
""Adam Sandler destroys the men's bathroom - for no reason""
""There was no title sequence, the movie just started"" (WHY is this supposed to be a criticism).
""...to dialogue that consists of meanness""
""Barely scratches into 'sweet' before being covered over with 'ickiness'"" (How old is he/she?).
""There is no subtle charm in this movie whatsoever"" (Subtle charm = like Big Daddy or Mr. Deeds?)
Anyway, let me add that I do really like Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer, and Happy Gilmore, though I don't care for most of his other movies. It's just hilarious, you can tell these people were mostly big Adam Sandler fans, and the ""criticisms"" they make of PDL are laughable in comparison with his other movies. I can't blame them really; clearly the trailers and advertisements led them to believe PDL was going to be a typical mindless Adam Sandler comedy.

1213909,5,B00000G02H,"I'm noticing a recurring theme in the films of Paul Thomas Anderson: Grace. He shows us characters that in any other film wouldn't have a chance at love or redemption, but gives them moments of beauty. Punck-Drunk Love is no exception.
Here, we are introduced to Barry Egan, played by Adam Sandler as a hopelessly anti-social, paranoid 30-something this side of a homeschooler. He is constantly tormented by his large number of sisters, who remind him of his hatred at being called ""gay boy"" and are always trying to get him to meet girls. Barry is a complete wreck. He eventually retreats to calling a phone sex operator, just to talk, and ends up getting stalked by the company (probably the worst thing that could ever happen to him). Yet, in all this, something wonderful is developing between him and a woman he has recently met, played by Emily Watson. Their relationship is the drop of heaven in Barry's hell, inspiring him to take a trip to Hawaii and eventually control forces within that he has never had control of before.
Simply put, the story is beautiful. It's also very funny at times, thanks to the tense, nervous performance by Sandler. The paranoia he has is often taken to comic heights, such as in the opening car crash scene, Barry's job, and his violent party outburst. A neat trick Anderson uses is not showing any title or credits in the beginning; it makes the audience rather tense as well, anticipating the words ""Punch-Drunk Love"" to pop up at any moment. The perfectly cast Watson, however, is the calm, loving force that this film needs. Her and Sandler's interludes throughout Punch-Drunk Love show how even the lowest of the low can find love in this cruel, troubled world.
When I saw Punch-Drunk Love several months ago, I walked away feeling better about myself. Maybe it was that as bad as I think I am, my relating with others is nowhere near as bad as Barry Egan's. Or maybe I enjoyed the beautiful cinematography and music score, which took me into a whole other world outside my own stressful existence. Or maybe it was just that, somehow, Punch-Drunk Love made me truly and deeply CARE about this character Barry Egan.

With 1999's Magnolia, he still delivered a remarkable film, but one that was handicapped by excess. Apparently having learned his lesson, Anderson restrains himself with Punch-Drunk Love which is his take on the romantic comedy genre.
In a scant 90 minutes (half the running time of Magnolia), Anderson presents us with a quirky vision of true love. Punch-Drunk Love takes a completely different direction from the director's previous work. Here we get a more cinematic world that is less based in reality. Instead of bombast and indulgence, we get eccentricity and concision. Punch-Drunk Love takes place in its own reality, where the rules are dictated only by the emotions of the characters. The surrealism is also illustrated by the colorful designs which overtake the screen at several points. Punch-Drunk Love is not so much trying to tell a story, but rather to give us an experience. It is not interested in convention, nor it is interested in being cute and happy. Its characters are imperfect people with quirks and insecurities. Things happen which are not easily explained. If the Coen Brothers made a romantic comedy, I imagine it would be similar to this film.
Punch-Drunk Love is anything but a conventional romance and that is its greatest asset. Many people were mystified by this film and reacted with hostility, but that may not be far from its intent. What an appropriate title ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is. It suggests romance from a skewed perspective. It suggests that what we will see might be different and challenging. However, many people have no desire to be challenged and simply want to see two good-looking stars in a predictable formula. If that is your desire then avoid this movie and look no further than How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days. For those of us who look for a bit more depth in movies, Punch-Drunk Love should be a treat.
I have not even mentioned Adam Sandler yet. Yes, he gives a fine performance. He proves that he is capable of more than just yelling and beating things up. He is charming as Barry Egan, but off-putting at the same time. Emily Watson is lovely as his love interest, the only person who may be his salvation from his life of insanity. Paul Thomas Anderson took a big chance with the casting of Sandler, but it works and it shows us how the Saturday Night Live alum is squandering his potential on stupid brain-dead comedies like Mr. Deeds when he does indeed have talent.
The DVD, however, is disappointing. After the excellent presentation of Boogie Nights, I would have expected more from this one. Why is there no director commentary? This was the most disappointing oversight. There is really nothing on this DVD set that gives any insight into the making of the film whatsoever. The ""deleted scenes"" are uninteresting, the ""Blossoms and Blood"" video unnecessary, the Mattress Man commercial is neat though. It's very disappointing that there is no documentary, outtakes, more deleted scenes or an audio commentary. This DVD should have just been a single-disc Superbit title. The movie disc is great though. Excellent picture and sound quality, with your choice of Dolby Digital or DTS soundtracks. The second disc is, unfortunately, completely unnecessary. Maybe someday, a really good Punch-Drunk Love special edition will be released with the full participation of P.T. Anderson.",1061078400,3,3599,4.970149253731344
1213912,5,B00000G02H,"""The Waterboy"" and ""Happy Gilmore"" are two of my favorite movies, and I can quote lines from ""The Wedding Singer"" in my sleep. Yes, Adam Sandler is my favorite actor.
That being said, I DID read the reviews of this movie which claimed that it was not the typical Sandler film. He didn't write or produce it as he does with most of his films. Here he is simply acting, and he does a great job.
I didn't expect it to be funny. If you expect a quotable laugh riot like ""Billy Madison,"" you are going to be disappointed.
""Punch-Drunk Love"" is not for everyone. It is strange and scary. Barry Egan (Sandler) is tormented by his sisters, seven bossy women who try to run his life and have shattered his self-image and left him with a raging anger that is portrayed as frightening, not funny as in ""Happy Gilmore."" He is a nice person who, because of his loneliness, finds himself trapped in a fraudulent scheme. When he falls in love, he finds great strength within himself. Emily Watson is charming as his love interest; her voice and mannerisms are angelic.
The scariest parts of the movie are like a bad dream where you are running through narrow, maze-like hallways and can't find your way out, or where everything is going wrong for you and you can't speak up to save yourself. That is the feeling that you get from watching this movie. Everything is horrifying and trance-like, from the sisters' mean voices to the background music to the colors and lighting. Adam Sandler does a great job; the dialogue is very natural, which is why there are no really memorable lines---real life isn't full of witty banter---and the movie is well-paced.
If you think this is going to be a mainstream romantic comedy you will be disappointed. It is a character study of a broken soul who finally finds unconditional love. I am really proud of Adam for taking a chance and doing this movie, although it won't appeal to the fans who consistently give him Nickelodeon Kids' Choice awards. (Personally, my 14 year-old would have no interest in this movie.) I'm sure Adam will go back to his usual fun movies but in the meantime it is best to read reviews before you see a movie, that way you won't be disappointed. And if you are one of those film-goers who puts Adam in the same category as Tom Green or Johnny Knoxville, you just might be very surprised by his talent.",1060992000,,2351,4.534117647058824

Maybe it was because I saw myself as the main charecter in a way, totally hopeless and lost, until he finds a beautiful, sweet girl who loves him. I've never been in love, I wouldn't know, but that's my guess, something about this movie opened up something in me that I've forgotten since I was 10. Anyways, Paul Thomas Anderson has made a film that almost anyone can relate to in one way or another, unless you've been happy for every second of your life, but I don't think that has happened to many people. This is one of those movies you can watch when you lose someone or something in you life which ment a lot to you, it reminds a person that happiness is a state of mind, nothing more",1060473600,,737,4.309352517985611

I think it's Sandler's best starring role since his days on SNL.  Sandler plays Barry.  All Barry wants out of life is a taste of what success and happiness truly are.  He's constantly ragged on by his seven, that's right, seven sisters about finding Ms. Right.  When Ms. Right comes along, much trouble follows and soon he finds himself way over his head when all he wanted was a simple life.  As I've mentioned, many ""die-hard"" Sandler fans will find this film hard to swallow.  For fans of P.T. Anderson, get ready for another great film that involves the usual dysfunctional family stigmas that seem to seamlessly flow throughout another masterfully told story.

1213956,5,B00000G02H,"This movie is brilliant.  Unlike most Sandler movies, it is not a comedy.  Punch Drunk Love is more of a love story, without that ""chick-flick"" sappiness.  Instead, the movie has a sort of eerie and twisted feel to it and the soundtrack fits perfectly.
This movie is definitely weird.  That's probably why I liked it.  You will understand what ""punch-drunk love"" is when it is over!",1060214400,,382,4.7272727272727275
1213957,5,B00000G02H,"Being a huge P.T. Anderson fan, there was no way I wouldn't watch this film.  But Punch-Drunk did remind me why I love Anderson's films so much.  Given this was definately a different experience than all three of this previous films.  There was still an Anderson mood to it all, his strange way of unfolding a story to us.  The way the film was shot was simply marvelous accenting his script.  In my opinion Anderson is a ""sound director.""  The mood and the feel of the movie depend heavily on sound.  The soundtrack is vital in Punch-Drunk, from the frantic interactions with Sandler to the romantic scenes with Watson.  The talent on this film get kudos also.  Anderson regulars Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman were as always great.  I've really started to enjoy Emily Watson also, her talent with every movie I see her in is really impressive.  I'd also thought I would never say this but Adam Sandler was awesome in this.  It's really great to see some ""new"" talent in someone who has shown so much lack of it in the past.  His performance was without a doubt masterful.  All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone out there.  At the root it's a romantic film, but so much more than that.

Barry Egan (Sandler) has issues.  Serious issues.  He's a full-fledged sociopath given to fits of fear and rage.  The character forever seems to be looking for the next 'big thing'.
And he finds it in Emily Watson.  Except, the next big thing is not a money-making proposal, but a life-altering, long-sought real relationship with a woman.  He didn't get it growing up in a household full of sisters, his contempt for which is readily displayed in scenes full of fear and rage that punctuate the film.
In the end, this movie is about nothing more than a pursuit of happiness and love.  The journey, to that end, oftentimes demands that the audience falls for familiar clichs.  I had no problem with that.  Even Shakespeare relied on clichs.",1060041600,2,965,4.730538922155689
1213959,3,B00000G02H,"Adam Sandler is by far the best aspect of this movie.  That's not saying a heck of a lot.
Sandler plays a mild-mannered somewhat dorky dweeb with a violent rage under the surface.  Everyone we meet backstabs and belittles him.  He has no friends, he says nothing, does nothing, has a pathetic job (he sells plungers) and life (messy undecorated one bedroom apartment...) - ok, beat me over the head with the premise.  Then he meets a girl, but only after getting himself on a hit list from an extortion phone-sex scam.
Sandler discovers all sorts of hidden strength due to his new-found love.  He stands up to his family, gets the extortionists off his back and gets the girl.  All very predictable, all very expected, all very very old.  The director tried to artify the film by using all sorts of surealistic shots, filming techniques, weird pans and colored tints.  Rather than enhance the film, this fluff soon becomes distracting.  Hint- if you want to be a subtle art film, don't beat your audience over the head with it from the first frame.
But Sandler himself gives a very good performance.  Probably his best acting (haven't seen anger managment), certainly his most expanded role.  Good for a rent, on dollar-a-nite only - don't buy.",1059955200,2,1244,4.73953488372093

Anyone who mistakes this film as an ""Adam Sandler movie"" or just a weird, romantic comedy is completely missing the point.  PT Anderson has crafted a masterpiece - through his script, camera movement, and Robert Elswitt's stunning cinematography - that challenges the idea of love and our perception of love.  Watch the deleted scenes and ""Blossoms and Blood"", the featurette.  Watch. The movie is not what it seems....there is more going on underneath the surface...  If you don't like this movie it's a shame, because you're missing out on the genius of my generation's greatest filmmaker and you're definitely missing out on the fun.",1059955200,,792,5.15625

1213985,5,B00000G02H,"It's unfortunate that people fail to see the idea behind the film. Postmodernism does tend to instill a feeling of apathy towards the subject, simply because the whole of postmodernism is based upon lack of structure, if it is based on anything at all. This movie will definitely leave you empty and confused, because it is, simply put, auspiciously cold; lackluster. The whole of the film is an allegory and bears the weight of heavily doped symbolic intentions. While there are many films that touch upon the darker sides of the human psyche (see Spirited Away; and to think it is a film meant for children in the eyes of Disney), few films will present it so well. The music is aggravating, yes, but it acheives what it was meant to; and you'll notice the theme of the music changes throughout the film.
I will not give a synopsis of the movie, but I will say that if you are the type of person whose subconscience is frenetic, then you will be likely to enjoy the film.",1059696000,3,973,4.502824858757062
1213986,3,B00000G02H,"I found this movie to be very beautiful. In fact, 2 of the 3 stars I gave it are for the gloriously artistic and compelling cinematography and fabulous quirky music. Every single shot told a bit of the subtext to the story-- the colors are intoxicating and tasty-looking. The light is surreal and dreamlike. The music is a perfect reflection of the pace and meaning under each scene. The soundtrack is probably a much better purchase than the dvd itself.
The other star is for the surprisingly good acting by Adam Sandler and his excellent supporting cast.
No stars at all, unfortunately, for a highly disappointing script which ulimately brought the movie down.
I usually love off-beat movies (plot is not always necesssary) which are either slightly disturbing or loose-ended enough for you to draw your own conclusions. This movie, however, although it seemed to WANT to be that kind of film, was not.
You learned to sort of like Adam Sandler's character and feel sympathy for his quirky, sweet love affair. Some very funny bits involved him dealing (sometimes violently) with his 7 exhaustinly meddling sisters. There were some very lovely scenes and moments. But, as a whole, the film failed to deliver.
For being a funky romantic film with a highly untraditional plot, it sort of worked...I have nothing against needing to put some energy into a film...but I spent most of the movie not quite knowing where any of the characters were coming from. For the first half hour I was completely confused by the one-track emphasis on Sandler's discovery of a piano that had been bizarrely dropped off in the middle of a road. The movie had a lot of moments like that-- you tended to spend a good deal of time having no idea where any of this was going, even after it had been clarified (as much as you were going to GET it clarified).
The rating is essentially for excessive language (mainly for the 500-or-so F*ck's).
I just didn't connect with this movie at all. Maybe it is unfair to give it such a low rating, especially because it was so lovely to look at. But I feel that if the only redeeming feature of a movie is its ""look"", it is not truly a good film. I felt the same way about ""2001: A Space Odessy"", even though everyone with taste is supposed to think that Stanley Kubrick is an artist and his movies are important.
Oh well, maybe I missed it, but I honestly think a LOT of people are going to miss the deal with ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and will find lots of better ways to spend a few hours.",1059350400,6,2499,4.567928730512249
1213987,5,B00000G02H,"once i saw the trailers and spots for this movie I knew it would be a movie worth seeing. i missed the theatrical release mostly because of its select city release. but once the dvd came out i rushed out and rented it. the first few minutes of the movie throw you off, but if you don't take the movie for granted and enjoy this movie, it actually is not a bad flick. The movie is very weird dialgoue-wise. Most of the dialogue doesn't make sense, but if you pay attention to some of the stuff said, it actually sounds like P.T.A. is a modern-day Shakespeare. Pretty cool, I think. Pretty stupid, you think.
Visually this movie rocks. I don't quite understand what the color interstitials were, but it kind of gives the movie an acid trip (I PERSONALLY DO NOT DO DRUGS) feel. For those of you who have seen Pink Floyd-The Wall, PDL is much like that in a way. Paul T. Anderson (NOT THE DIRECTOR OF RESIDENT EVIL, MIND YOU THAT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND IRREVERENT DIRECTOR) has chosen to make his movies with an indie type camera style. It doesn't have a Blair Witch look but the camera moves around and stuff, almost like it was done on digital video. If you see the DVD and have a nice color scheme on your TV (if your TV has bad picture quality you probably won't enjoy the movie as much) or you follow the directions in the pointless booklet inside the slipcase, it tells you this:
""Get Barry's (Adam Sandler) suit blue, blue, blue. Don't be shy. Get Barry's shirt white, don't be afraid to let is bloom a bit. TURN UP THE CONTRAST! Make sure your blacks are black nad listen to it loud!"" (I'll get to the audio in a minute)
Follow that and you're golden and ready to SEE PUNCH DRUNK LOVE!
The audio is also a big thing you need to hear to understand the movie. I recommend that if you have a nice home theater sound system with Dolby Digital/DTS capability, switch the audio over to DTS and crank the sound up, because from the first few minutes of the movie, it will draw you in. If you are watching the movie without a sound system, switch over to the Dolby Surround track because it is directed more to the TV only crowd. All the audio tracks in the movie immerse you, but the DTS has the best quality. The dialogue is mastered well but if you have a bad TV with a bad speaker(s) (PLEASE UPDATE AND WATCH THE MOVIE) or bad picture tube, please don't buy this movie because these are the requirements of viewing Punch Drunk Love.
At least a 27"" TV or higher with STEREO SPEAKERS if watching without a:
A nice home theater setup with speakers set up in the way the instruction booklet that came with your surround sound set.
PDL, while not perfect is a beautiful movie that must be experienced as best as possible. And if you have seen the movie you will understand the first half of my title. If not, Adam Sandler's character puts pudding to a good use. JUST WATCH THE MOVIE ALREADY!
If you don't have any of the good equipment listed above, please watch the VHS copy because that's about as good as your experience will be!",1059264000,,3034,4.333919156414763

In fact, it's really more like 2.5 stars.  Sandler does a good job of portraying a nearly-dysfunctional geek, but the ""credit card"" storyline is just too bizarre and in the end everything is just left hanging.  PDL reminded me of the Coen Brothers' movies (Fargo, Big Lebowski, etc.) but it lacks the clear focus and sardonic vision that make their movies so entertaining. Also, production quality on PDL is mediocre at best, with lots of overexposed shots. And while the setup is promising, the movie really bogs down in the middle.

1213989,4,B00000G02H,"The term ""punch-drunk"" I believe originates in the 19th century or early 20th century.  It  was used by doctors to describe a syndrome of cognitive impairment brought on by a  severe beating leading to traumatic brain injury.  The ""punch drunk wife syndrome"" was  ascribed to unfortunate women who were severely and repeatedly beaten by their  drunken husbands.  Boxers sustain similar problems and in their case the diagnosis is  termed ""dementia pugilistica.""  So the term ""punch drunk"" in the title is rather  interesting.  There is the clear explosive rage lying underneath the surface.  And, there  are also the bright lights and floating colors one might see after a sudden blow to the  head, as in ""seeing stars.""  Perhaps only love allows us to see the light, without which we  are blind and enraged.  Love reveals to us our demons, allows us to save ourselves from  the dark and despair.  This is a rather Christian view I realize, but seems to fit with this  story.  If you don't believe, watch the movie again and notice that when Emily Watson  first appears there is a bright halo of light above her head. She appears angelic, and, indeed, she saves Adam Sandler's character with love and forgiveness.  Imagine a Christian theology without ever mentioning Christ and empowered by a woman with divine power to save a lost soul.  Who would  have thought?  Maybe the Pope ought to see this movie.
A more practical note should be made regarding the DVD itself.  This is a wonderful transfer, with a very clear picture and excellent color sturation.  the sound is also recorded very well.

Few of us go so far as to destroy a restaurant men's room when we do it, but many of us understand that misplaced rage.  I certainly identified with Barry Eagan, and the supression he suffered, the rage he fought with, and that constant effort to be a nice guy; and I found the film moving for that reason.
If you've ever felt alone, or like no one cared about what you had to say or what you felt, I have a strong suspicion that this movie will make an impression.",1058745600,2,606,4.260869565217392
1213991,4,B00000G02H,"Barry Egans life has all the earmarks of an absurdist, Kafkaesque nightmare.  Plagued by idiosyncrasies and riddled with neuroses, Barry is the classic introverted nerd, a man who is completely incapable of relating to people on a social level.  Barry finds himself harassed by seven sisters who do everything they can to demean and ridicule their brother, all in the guise of helping him when really all they want is to dominate him.  It isn't until Barry meets up and falls in love with Lena Leonard that he begins to find the inner strength and intestinal fortitude to stand up for himself and create a life worth living.  Barry also finds himself caught in a bizarre tangle with some dangerous thugs after he innocently calls a phone sex service one lonely night.  As with any true Kafkaesque hero, Barry becomes the enmeshed victim of an ill-defined threat that seems to exist outside the scope of reason and everyday life.
With Punch-Drunk Love, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson has narrowed his focus somewhat from his two previous films, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, to concentrate more intensely on a single individual subject.  Barry is a wholly unique creation, a man who seems barely sane at times, yet who also strikes chords of familiarity in the viewer.  How many of us cannot identify in at least some way with the obsessions, anxieties and sense of hopelessness that plague Barry to such an exaggerated degree?  Despite his frequent outbursts of explosive violence (directed at objects rather than people), Barry also displays an innate goodness and tenderness that make him, in the long run, a highly sympathetic character.  Andersons triumph is in making the centerpiece of his film emotionally conflicted and psychologically complex.  We don't feel as if we have ever met anyone quite like Barry Egan before  and this uniqueness goes a long way towards winning us over to his side.
Visually, Anderson has once again proved himself a master of widescreen composition.  Every shot in the film helps to contribute to the strange, otherworldly quality of Barrys life and experience.  Anderson always seems to have Barry walking down sterile corridors or hanging aloof in one corner of the screen while the rest of the shot reveals the stark emptiness of the world around him.  Anderson knows how to use his camera to emphasize Barrys isolation not only from his external environment but also the isolation Barry feels from the dark part of himself he wishes he could reject and overcome.  At times, Barry is fully aware of his almost pathological weirdness and he frankly admits that he would like very much to change.  It isn't until Lena becomes a major force in his life that he is subtly, gradually, almost imperceptibly, able to break away from the internalized demons that haunt him.
As always, Anderson has drawn remarkable performances from his cast, many of whom have appeared in some of his previous works.  Emily Watson, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luiz Guzman all make their marks in supporting roles, but it is Adam Sandler, as Barry Egan, who is truly a revelation.  In his first mostly serious role, Sandler demonstrates a mastery of control in a part that could easily have slipped over into maniacal overkill (as it would almost certainly have done in any other Sandler film).  Instead, Sandler delivers an intensely subtle performance, one that allows us to see every facet of this emotionally complex character without ever letting any one of his qualities dominate over the others.  This is clearly one of the best and most unfairly overlooked acting jobs of 2002.
Punch-Drunk Love is not a typical Adam Sandler comedy and it may never be appreciated by the great, unwashed masses who have trouble dealing with any film that seems just too far out there for their own provincial taste or understanding.  But for those with an appetite for offbeat, original and challenging filmmaking, Punch-Drunk Love is clearly one of the finest romantic comedies of the past several years.",1058659200,,4013,4.977544910179641
1213992,5,B00000G02H,"THE MOVIE
 What attracts me on PT Anderson's movies is that they're so rich in details that the more you see them, the more you discover. This adds a lot to the ""re-view"" level and pleasure experience. Not to mention his cinematography, use of music, actor's direction. Punch-Drunk Love is no exception.

This is a story about change, about opening our hearts, about taking control of our lives. About blue meeting red. And the positive consequences this meeting can produce.

Adam Sandler is a sad and frustrated guy whose life is not in his hands. He just keeps pushing it. He lives in a blue world, he's Mr Blues. Pay real attention to the colors in this movie. The movie starts blue, on a blue morning just before the sun start to shine. Hot colors represent desire, temptation to change, challenges.

The first sign his life is about to change comes as a shocking morning crash. Just like the frogs shook lives in magnolia. The second sign - a red cab drops a piano (not a piano, actually, but a keyboard instrument whose name I don't remember now). The third sign - RED HOT - Emily Watson, who's always wearing red until they meet for real (I won't tell it all, am just trying to help clarify some points to make PDL more enjoyable).

After these signs, it's left for him to do something, to choose between changing or not his status quo. By picking the piano, he opts for change. And when a truck scares him, he's advised that this won't be risk free, but he goes for it. And we have a beautiful movie everyone can take some lessons from.

Some people argue that there are times when the music goes over the dialogs, that it's ""badly mixed"". They didn't get it. Please note that every time this occurs, the dialogs are not important, and the music adds mood to what is - the interaction, the growing feelings between Adam and Emily, or Adam and his own life.

A movie I recommend that deals with this very much is A Man And A Woman, by Claude Lelouch. The dialogs are never as important as the relation, the reaction, the gestures, the looks between the ""man"" and the ""woman"". Simply beautiful and original - a history told by gestures, not only words. Pure cinema.

So, to enjoy this lovely movie, pay attention to the details, observe the colors, what and who is out-of-focus and listen to the music. Everything is very well orchestrated by a fabulous, talented, original and capable director (maybe storyteller fits better) - Paul Thomas Anderson. He sometimes defy our minds, and that's very good.

THE DVD

It's Superbit. But sometimes I feel magnolia has a better picture... Anyway, the transfer is very good. The sound - DTS - is very good, using all channels for music and effects very well. This is somewhat rare, specially for this kind of movie. It surprised me more than the Superbit image.

The second disc has one specially interesting extra, which adds to the comprehension of the movie - Blossoms And Blood. And, also, some traditional extras, like trailers, deleted scenes, more samples of the amazing art used and ""scopitones"". What's missing, in my opinion, is a featurette with PT Anderson, like there is on magnolia. Maybe he felt Blossoms And Blood would fulfill this. By the way, the image on this extra is very good.

1214028,4,B00000G02H,"Adam Sandler will probably forever have the reputation for being the loveable and endearing SNL goofball in such movies as Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. Though he made Punch Drunk Love, probably his most serious role since The Wedding Singer but it's different. Sandler plays Barry Egan, a somewhat socially disoriented owner of a small business, daily harassed by seven sisters, whose taunts of his childhood lead him to paroxysms and fits of self doubt, rage and violence. He calls a phone sex hotline more for company and an attempt to make a friend with a girl, something he seems to have trouble doing due to his timidness and insecurity, rather than for carnal purposes (likemost men do when they call one of those hotlines), but he gets himself involved with a major problem, both emotionally and financially.
Then, one of his sister's friends, Lena, played by Emily Watson, meets Barry, and a romance blossoms. Though, Barry still has to go through many troubling obstacles so that he can find true happiness w/Lena. I don't want to give the film away.
The cinematography itself is bizarre. It's almost like a Clockwork Orange, the Radiohead video ""Fake Plastic Trees"" (the supermarket scene is a testament to that), and your average Hollywood romance movie. It shows Adam Sandler in a new, more serious light, though his romantic side is still evident, and whether you like the film or hate it, you must give Adam Sandler credibility for trying something different. I ultimately found the film rewarding and interesting, better than most 'romance' movies though I had no idea what to expect when I saw the film.",1058313600,,1634,4.923913043478261
1214029,4,B00000G02H,"Punch-Drunk Love is the fourth film by one of my favorite directors, Paul Thomas Anderson (Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, Magnolia).  It stars Adam Sandler and Emily Watson as well as several PTA regulars (Luis Guzman, Philip Seymour Hoffman).  Despite the fact that the film is directed by PTA, I was skeptical about seeing Sandler in this movie.  It wasn't that I didn't think he could do the job, but it was simply that I didn't think he could do the job.  Happily, I was wrong.  Adam Sandler was spot on in the role of Barry Egan.
Barry Egan (Sandler) is a business man.  He owns his own business, but is a lonely, slightly neurotic man.  He finds himself unable to approach women and his relationship with his sisters does not help matters any.  They remind him of when he was a young boy and they teased him and he got so mad that he smashed the glass door with a hammer.  Barry still has that same explosive anger inside him.  He is restrained (a rarity for Sandler), but is still capable of flying off the handle when he gets mad enough.  He has no ability to control his anger.  Several times throughout the movie he gets angry and destroys things.
Barry is lonely one night and calls a phone sex line.  While there is very obviously a scam going on, Barry is trusting and gives far too much information.  This turns ugly and the phone sex operator has her boss (Philip Seymour Hoffman) send three men to extort Barry and beat him up.  They do, and they will come back into the film later.
Barry meats a woman named Lena Leonard (Emily Watson).  Lena is a friend of Barry's sister and wants to get to know him.  Barry is initially too shy and awkward but somehow they begin a friendship and then a relationship.  While Watson does a fantastic job as Lena, the relationship isn't quite believable.  The problem is that there doesn't seem to be any reason for Barry and Lena to get together, except that they had decent conversation when they were out on a date.
This is a very good movie, but I'm hesitant to say that it is one of PTA's best or that it is as good as the best of 2002.  It falls short of both Boogie Nights and the masterpiece that was Magnolia (that's right, I said Magnolia).  Everyone turns in excellent performances but there is just no reason to really care for Barry nor does the movie have the heart that Boogie Nights and Magnolia did.  Paul Thomas Anderson is a fantastic young director and I look forward to his future work, and Punch-Drunk Love is a good movie, it just isn't a great one.",1058227200,,2519,4.39524838012959

Sandler's character starts at point A and ends at point Z.  He experiences a change - love has come into his life.  He realizes he's a good person.  He hated himself at the beginning.
There may not be a lot of special effects or big explosions (the signal in most American films that the ending of the film is coming), but PUNCH DRUNK LOVE is not like that.  It's a small movie.
It's about Barry Egan and Lena Leonard, two weird souls who find each other and accept each other's weirdness.  The ""bad guys"" are Utah phone sex thugs.  A harmonium (a small piano-like organ) dropped in the street outside his office is a symbol of the changes that are in store for Barry Egan.

1214033,4,B00000G02H,"I loved this 95-minute ""exploration"" about a ""man-child"" who finds ""intoxicating"" love for the first time.
What happens if you're a boy (Adam Sandler) - in a man's body - with no confidence?  Sandler plays Barry Egan.  He hates himself, he feels like a loser and he doesn't know why.  He cries for no reason.  His heart is big, his seven sisters love him, but they make fun of him.  No one understands him.
Of course they don't.  He smashes window and walls, tears up a rest room and stocks up on pudding to cash in on a marketing promotion flaw.  Is he also a wacko?
But then a miracle.  He meets a courageous and perhaps foolish girl who likes the very things he hates about himself.  Love makes him so powerful, his life suddenly has a purpose.  It's like winning the lottery.
This is about the only thing ""simple"" about the so-called ""storyline"" of Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" a film I found bizarre and sweet - perhaps too artsy for its own good - yet oddly uplifting and satisfying.
When Sandler's Barry Egan says Emily Watson's character is so pretty that he wants to ""smash her face with a sledgehammer,"" it sounds better in the movie than on paper.  It's funny and it works.  If you're a child, it impossible to find the ""right words"" to express the intensity of ""punch-drunk love.""
I don't blame people who hated this film.  It would be snobby to say some people ""just won't get it.""  There's no point lying.  ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is a film that requires properly managed expectations.  Part of the problem (and genius) is Anderson's decision to cast Adam Sandler himself.  Sandler is a good actor here, but he doesn't do anything spectacular.  The best way to avoid feeling cheated is to push everything you know about Sandler out of your mind.  Pretend you're seeing him for the first time.  Sandler has teased his violent persona in previous over-the-top comedies, but in ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" writer-director Anderson has channeled this tortured ""self-hatred"" act into something that isn't supposed to be funny.  He explores what might happen - if such a person fell in love - for the FIRST time.
Equally maddening to some, Anderson doesn't use conventional words and images to ""articulate"" the mysteries of love.  He makes us see everything through the eyes of a loser who's never experienced them.  We see splashes of color and hear ""high-as-a-kite"" music that mirrors his euphoria.  Anderson doesn't spell everything out in deep dialogue, because in real relationships, we don't talk about everything.  Words come close, but they're rarely ""dead-on"" about what we're really feeling.
""Punch-Drunk Love"" works best as a ""what if?"" romance involving a man who's emotionally stunted.  I don't know if a woman like Emily Watson's character exists.  I don't demand to know why she chases Sandler because I feel I'm watching everything through the eyes of Sandler's Barry Egan.  This is a story about the boy, not the girl.  Watson appears so radiant to Sandler's character that he feels she's looking right through him, making things easier.  This is all that matters to him.
P. T. Anderson is always offbeat, but I didn't expect him to be so sadistically charming.  Unlike the pessimism of his previous films, this effort brims with optimism, delivering abstract ideas without using a chalkboard.
Emily Watson gets the last line in the film and some people feel short-changed by it (I won't give it away).  But to me, it's terrific.  It's not a ""happily ever after"" prediction.  Instead, it's an open-ended, three-word expression of hope, acknowledging obstacles ahead without listing 'em.  It comes closer to the giddy feelings mirroring the complexities of love as we really know them, without getting gushy.  Why do we ""love"" at all?  Is it necessary?  ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is an American original.  Calling it a ""romantic-comedy"" is very misleading.",1057881600,7,3874,4.901538461538461
1214063,1,B00000G02H,"For a 95 minute movie, I had a lot of trouble sitting through it. It moves at a slow pace with long pauses in dialogue. The music is loud and overshadows the dialogue with an annoying array for clinking and banging. Although this was supposed to be a breakthrough role in which Adam Sandler evolves to drama, it is shown that he can only do one thing to call it acting- yell. Similar to Happy Gilmore and Waterboy, he goes on a temper tantrum of yelling and breaking items. His love interest is a nosy person who asks why Adam Sandler's character, Barry, does the things he does. The sister who sets Barry up with Emily Watson's character in the movie is annoying, often asks about why he is acting so strange, before proving that the reason for this is because she is agrivating and the being neurotic runs in the family. The idea of the plot is stupid, to focus around a phone sex hotline and a business of selling plungers. I think Adam Sandler focus is yelling in comedies, not dramas.",1057795200,,989,4.409836065573771

1214065,2,B00000G02H,"Give Adam Sandler extra credit for trying to broaden his range with Punch Drunk Love.  The key word there is ""trying"", because Sandler puts more effort into his performance here than he did in all his previous films combined.  That's not exactly a difficult task, since Sandler is responsible for one the laziest movies ever made (""Big Daddy"").  Paul Thomas Anderson was smart enough to see a running theme in Sandler's characters and attempt to show the flipside of that character - the weeping clown, if you will.  That Sandler was willing to reverse his persona so readily certainly deserves admiration.
Critics, as a collective, despise Sandler.  And that's probably because they didn't follow his work from the beginning of his career, when he released a brilliant comedy album (""They're All Gonna Laugh at You"") and did the ""Denise Show"" sketch, probably the best SNL bit of the past 15 years.  If Sandler's efforts don't translate as well to full-length movies, it doesn't mean he isn't a gifted performer.  Misguided, maybe.  But anyone with a brain knows he's a talented performer.
Unfortunately, Punch Drunk Love ends up doing him a huge disservice.  It's a good concept wasted.  The Tragic Sandler featured here is stuck in a film that has myriad problems.  There's no real plot to speak of.  The musical score is grating and obnoxious.  And, worst of all, it offers no reason for its lead characters (Sandler and Emily Watson) to fall in love with one another.
All of that can be blamed on Anderson, who still owes the world for the crime that was Magnolia.  Anderson cuts the running time in half here, yet Punch Drunk Love still feels three hours long.  You keep waiting for the film to settle down and establish some kind of rhythm of its own, but it never does.  It instead exists as a series of tangentially related bursts of oddness.  That may work for a Radiohead record, but movie audiences usually need (and deserve) something in the way of structure.
Sandler's character Barry Egan is also poorly written.  He acts irrationally, which is realistic enough.  The problem is that he just doesn't seem like a real person.  Sandler makes the mistake of giving Egan a babyish, almost mentally crippled way of speaking, and his violent behavior only makes him a curiosity, not a person with identify with or care about.  Other characters only exist to puzzle over why Barry acts the way he does.  But it's hard to imagine that many people would continue asking about someone who's so clearly a lost cause.
Punch Drunk Love continues a major losing streak for Anderson, who was given too much directorial leeway before he deserved it.  Anderson has a true gift for annoying viewers.  One scene in Punch Drunk Love features Egan's sister berating him with the score screeching away in the background.  It's almost impossible to tolerate, which is par for the course these days with Anderson's films.  Punch Drunk Love, like Magnolia, seems designed only to appeal to the director himself and no one else.  It's sad, because in terms of photography this is one of the most beautiful films of the past year.  But Anderson needs to find some substance beneath his style.  Too bad for Sandler.
(It's worth noting that if you're looking for the traditional wacky Sandler movie, you should avoid Punch Drunk Love at all costs.  It isn't funny at all.  Then again, neither was Mr. Deeds.)",1057795200,13,3394,4.810017271157167
1214066,2,B00000G02H,"I'm not an Adam Sandler fan at all, but I am huge fan of both Magnolia and Boogie Nights! That's why my experience with this movie was so weird for me. I loved Adam Sandler in the movie but, in the end, the movie was totally let down by the story. Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan, a self employed business man who seems to be socially challenged (as well as fashion challenged) with 7 sisters and no brothers. It seems that he has been teased all of his life by his sisters and, as a result of this endless torment, he has depression issues as well as connection issues. Feeling lonely and vulnerable one night, he calls a sex line for some conversation and eventual release. Unfortunately for him, the sex line is run by a guy who black mails and extorts money from his ""more well off"" customers by threatening to reveal their ""perverted"" calls to the people around them (wives, girlfriends and business colleges). Barry, who seems to be a broken man; week and lifeless, meets a young lady named Lena Leonard, played by Emily Watson, through the help of one of his sisters. Emily becomes the woman of his dreams! Barry finds himself trying to win over Lena and at the same time hide from her the sex call debacle and to clear up any embarrassing things that his sisters might have said to her about him. It turns out that Lena (who is a little quirky herself) is the ideal woman for him and gives him a strength that he has never known. She is the catalyst that propels him from his inner prison. In theory this movie has allot to work with to make a great dark comedy, but in the end, it falls short. Adam Sandler really plays himself in this movie, but with a more serious approach, and I really enjoyed his performance. What I didn't like in this movie was some of the ""artsy visuals"" that were thrown in. For example, I'm still trying to figure out why a van filled with shady looking characters pull up, screeching, to his work parking lot and drop off a miniature piano!? In Magnolia these weird visuals worked, like in the end when it started to rain frogs. This represented one of the biblical plagues on man that God would put upon us when we are at our worst. I don't get the miniature piano reference, except they needed a way to introduce the piano because he (Adam Sandler) pays so much attention to it through out the movie. A garage sale purchase would have sufficed! Also, the Superbit release is a little bit of a mystery to me. The colors and sounds didn't seem, to me, to need a premium release. This is a movie that has some entertaining moments due to a great collection of actors but the story is this movies down fall and I if you are a fan of these guys and have enjoyed their other projects and really feel a need to see it, rent it!",1057795200,,2757,4.334622823984526

The only, and I repeat, only, redeeming feature of this movie is the acting.  Sandler, Watson, Guzman, and Hoffman are absolutely outstanding, bringing an incredible believability to their characters, in spite of everything else.  But I was left shaking my head in wonder as to what the whole point was.  Yes, the movie had its moments, but they were very few and far between, with an overwhelming lack of focus and direction pervading the majority of the film.  I suppose that if you enjoy art house fair, you might find something to rave about, but even though I look for something deeper than superficial entertainment in a movie, I just couldn't seem to find anything here to keep me satisfied.
As far as the quality of the DVD, it's a good transfer, excellent sound (although a very odd soundtrack), and the second disk has a plethora of special features...none of which I found overly interesting.

1214071,4,B00000G02H,"I will start by saying this: `Punch-Drunk Love' is not at all like a `Billy Madison', a `Happy Gilmore', or even a `Big Daddy'.  This is not your average comedy; in fact, it's more of a romance/drama than a laugh-out-loud comedy.  Rest assured, dear loyal fans, Mr. Sandler does manage to deliver a number of top-notch laughs in a few top-notch scenes.  This movie is quietly colorful, sometimes loud, and all in all a decent film that (almost) anyone can enjoy.  Even if you HATE every Adam Sandler movie you've ever seen.  I have always enjoyed the aforementioned movies, and I tried very hard to keep an open mind going into this one.  And if you're able to do that, you'll come away feeling as if you're time was well spent.  Sandler's acting here is by far the best of his career, and yet it's probably not his best movie.  I don't know how it works, but it works rather well.
From very the start, this movie is strange.  That's exemplified during the first five minutes.  Barry Egan (Sandler) is just one of those people you feel sorry for.  He's obviously a loner who seems to have numerous struggles with women.  But he's not left to wallow in his own inaccuracies.  Instead he has seven sisters to do that for him.  So instead of taking one persistent sister's advice on a date, he calls a phone sex line in hopes of finding... well, something.  What he finds--rather than just 30 minutes of ""fun"" for $3.95--is that his life is about to get much, much worse.  He finds his secretive perversion to be something more than the kind of thing one would be ashamed of.  In the midst of this problem, Barry does manage to find happiness in someone.  She was the girl who was supposed to be set-up with him.  But fittingly, Barry's disbelief with set-ups is lost when the two hit it off.  From there Barry is left to deal with his hidden obsession with Lena (Emily Watson) and at the same time end his brawl with the aggressive phone sex business.  I really enjoyed this movie, though I think it'll be harder for others to do the same.  And I don't know how you could hear about this movie without the name Adam Sandler being mentioned.  From a production point of view, `Punch-Drunk Love' is excellent; absolutely flawless.  The way they put loud crashes and the occasional song into the movie and its dialogue is brilliant.  And noteworthy.  There are times during the film when there is no talking.  Still, the music and sound effects usually keep you entertained.
Even though I'm strangely comfortable with how diverse this movie is, I did, however, find myself enjoying (particularly) the anger outbursts which Sandler's character had.  For example, the payphone scene kept me and my girlfriend laughing for about ten minutes; we rewound it twice.  Along with that classic scene, there's about four more that will have everybody wetting themselves in the same fashion that `Billy Madison` did (no pun intended).  I don't want to spoil them for you.  But really, had the director put more comical outbreaks into the script it would've lost its prominence as a true romance film.  And as a romance, it's a good movie.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is for two (probably trivial) reasons...
#1 / At times the movie was very slow (the quietness not included).  You will lose focus if you have a short attention span.
#2 / There were a few unnecessary vulgarities.  Sandler handled the f-words well--and they fit in perfectly with the anger-induced parts mentioned above--but a few other were uncalled for.
Other than that, the movie is reasonably flawless.  The blending of comedy, drama and romance is perfect; they all flow together very nicely.  And even the action bits were decently used.  I will again make note of how atypical `Punch-Drunk Love' is.  If you saw the trailer for it you most likely were confused as to the genre this movie would fit into.  In all fairness, it's hard to categorize it justly.  I'd say it's about 45% romance, 35% comedy, 14.5% drama, 5% action, and .5% adult.  Prepare yourself for a good movie in the vein of ""good = different"" rather than just a straightforward walk in the park.  Adam Sandler is dazzling throughout; it almost seems as if he`s looking for the critic's respect (that's okay, right?... He`s been deserving for years).  Emily Watson is intelligently quirky in her all-important performance.  And even Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman are at the top of their games in their small but significant roles.  Each character has a chance to shine, and they shine bright when their number is called.  Watch this movie if you like Adam Sandler (as an actor, not just a slapstick-minded comic) and/or twisted romance movies that move at a slower pace than normal.

This movie captures those feelings perfectly.
I think some may find its appeal lost on them, but anyone willing to slide completely into this beautifully strange world will be rewarded in the end with smiles.  And, it is only about 90 minutes long, so your commitment to it won't take long.

1214108,5,B00000G02H,"""Punch-Drunk Love"" is unlike any other Sandler film out there.  I am a big fan of most of Sandler's work, with the exception of ""Anger Management"" and ""Mr. Deeds"".  In these films Sandler played a nicer, less aggressive person.  In ""Happy Gilmore"", ""The Waterboy"", and some others, he played a pretty aggressive character.  Sandler is much funnier in these roles.  In ""Punch-Drunk Love"", Sandler gives his best performance of his career.  However, this is not Sandler's funniest film, but it is his best.
Having read other reviews of films on the amazon, I find more and more that many people give formulaic comedies five stars, and then give deep, great films that are dramas somewhere between one and three stars.  Why is this?  People love films like ""Just Married"" and ""National Security"" to name some recent ones.  First of all, these films are not funny.  The jokes are tired, and the whole thing is predictable.  We know pretty much the whole layout of the film.
Where as in a movie like ""Punch-Drunk Love"", we don't know what would happen next.  The movie is so intriguing.  Not just in plot, but in everything.  The characters are so odd.  They have motives we are unsure of, yet we want to know about them.  They are deep people, with a background.  Ashton Kutcher in ""Just Married"" i not a deep character.  He was born, goofed off his whole life, and then married Brittany Murphy.  This is boring.
""Punch-Drunk Love"" is such a nice movie to think about and to watch. The picture is lovely, and the way it's shot is absolutly beautiful.  What a marvelous film.",1057017600,,1570,4.681318681318682
1214109,5,B00000G02H,"""Punch-Drunk Love"" is a compelling and strange film - sort of an avant-garde romantic comedy - centering on the love, trials and tribulations of a frustratingly socially inept character, Barry Egan, played with remarkable skill by a person who hitherto was thought of as good for only big dumb laughs, Adam Sandler.
As many have observed, this is indeed a love-it-or-hate-it affair that will alienate and confuse Sandler fans who only like him for those dumb laughs and lowbrow films. But, it should be noted, Sandler isn't really stepping into entirely new shoes; his character is more of an extension of the one he already plays, just plumped for more depth to suit the needs of the movie. He's still the same awkward, overgrown kid who seems ready to explode at any moment from pent-up angst.
But get behind the arty nature of this film, its terrific off-beat percussive soundtrack and its stunning color palate, and you have a movie that, true to the romantic-comedy tradition, will make you feel warm and fuzzy by the end. It's a misfit love story, a tale of two people who are starved for intimate human connection but lucky enough to find and be drawn to one another. Barry, due to the unforeseen circumstances he finds himself in, is forced to muster up the strength to confront and shut down his enemies and aggressively pursue what he wants in an inspiring chain of events.
To my eye and standard tube 27-inch TV, the transfer of picture and sound on this DVD is impeccable, and certainly worth the price of admission considering that it's a two-disc set. It is also packaged very nicely, as marketing heads have probably figured out that, while it may be taboo to judge a book by its cover, people generally don't have qualms about doing so to a DVD case yet. Thankfully your purchase won't fall apart once you get to know it better.
Paul Thomas Anderson is an incredibly talented filmmaker. While not exactly prolific, he has already produced four outstanding films with not one dud while still in his early 30s. It's comforting to know that at least one director out there will, if abiding history, put out movies that will always be worth the $... to see, and then some. ""Punch-Drunk Love"" differs from his earlier films such as ""Magnolia"" and ""Boogie Nights"" in that it is constructed on a smaller scale, but shares with those long epics an energetic storytelling vision of the painful lives of dysfunctional people.",1057017600,3,2431,4.76303317535545
1214110,1,B00000G02H,"I feel so disappointed with this movie. It is like someone tried to stick together random scenes that went to different movies. There really was no need for the MANY sisters to even be in the story, the stupid car crash and piano at the beginning should have given me a clue as to just how horrible this movie was going to be. But it was Adam Sandler, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and watched it all. I feel so mad that I've wasted time in my life to watch this.
It made no sense. It's the normal ""he's bad with women, then out of the blue pops in this girl that he instantly falls for and who likes him to"" ... But they add in odd things that really just confuse you, and make no sense. I think it was very poorly written, and can't believe it ever made it as far as letting people endure watching it. I own over 400 DVDs and have watched more movies than I care to count, and this is one of the few that is just so horrible and BORING that I'd give anything to get that time back!
I mean, it opens with a street where a car crashes, then some van drops a small piano on the street and takes off...Adam Sandler then meets this girl, and then we meet his many many siblings, who really have nothing to do with the movie, except the 1 sister who sets him up...he calls a 900 number and talks to some weird woman giving her ALL his personal info that in real life, nobody would ever be stupid enough to give out. But instead of that being the end of it and the movie progressing with the ""love"" story, the woman asks him for alot of money and when he says no her friends/family chase him down and beat the crap out of him and take the money. I really don't think this part with the phone sex lady's issues was needed in the movie either...
He finally gets mad at the end of the movie and you're thinking, alright, finally something interesting is about to happen to make this movie worth sitting through...but no, he barely lets out a yell, and the bad guy backs off like there's no tomorrow. And to top it off, it has annoying red and blue tones throughout the entire movie. Very very disappointing movie. I wouldn't even recommend buying it if you're a die hard Adam Sandler fan, it is THAT bad. I've no doubt it would have never been made in the first place, let alone made ANY money if it did not star Adam Sandler. He should just stick to comedies, cause this was just a nasty film that never should have existed.
Sorry to you that liked it, but I really can't begin to imagine how you could. It ranks along with ""Full Frontal"". Which, if possible, was even worse than PDL. At least PDL wasn't made with some guy walking around with a camera on his arm, looking like they went out back and video taped a movie...pretty close to it though.",1057017600,3,2750,4.142056074766355

If you like quirky films (and I'm talking about ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Adaptation"", ""PI"", ""Very Bad Things""  and films like that here) you MUST SEE this film. Sandler and the editorial crew of this film have captured ANXIETY perfectly and distilled it to its purest form.  Watch the scene with Emily Watson and Sandler's sister in his office with too much going on--the soundtrack pulses in frenzy and you simply know what's going on in our protagonist's mind...clear and pure anxiety and nothing else.  The fact that he proves to be much more competent in the end than we expected only make this movie experience that much more enjoyable.
Get it.  The soundtrack is bizarre, the images are strange and the love story is extremely sweet.  The side-story that adds the tension to the film is straight out of ""Boogie Nights"" and has a most satisfying conclusion (""that's that."").

1214131,4,B00000G02H,"As a fan of P.T. Anderson films, this was one that I approached with some trepidation, namely because it starred Adam Sandler, whose movies have always inspired a particular kind of loathing from me.  Although Punch Drunk Love is certainly Anderson's weakest film to date, I was pleasantly surprised.  Sandler's performance as Barry Egan, a man hen-pecked to the point of serious neurosis by his seven sisters, is excellent and garners sympathy from the viewer even when we see the dark side of his character.
As for the rest of the film, it is one of the most beautifully shot films I have ever seen.  The cinematography and camera work are absolutely brilliant, with each shot carefully constructed like a work of art.  However, the film suffers from a script that is often not fleshed out enough, leaving the viewer with too many questions.  The characters and situations are intriguing enough to warrant a deeper understanding of them through background information, but that information is never provided.  All in all, the film stretches itself a bit thin branching out in too many directions that are all only partially developed.
What Punch Drunk Love presents us with is part character study, part love story.  We are given insight into Barry Egan's quirky and eccentric mind and see the composite of a person made meek and jittery by years of verbal browbeating.  Anderson effectively makes the viewer feel Egan's neurosis by showing his bizarre behavior and creating a feeling of tension and claustrophobia through both camera work and music.  We are also witness to Egan beginning to overcome his timidity and take charge of his life by drawing on the strength that his relationship with Emily Watson's character Lena has given him.  What is truly at the heart of this film though is the message that now matter how strange or different we may be, there is someone out there for us, someone who complements and completes us.  However, finding this person often requires a certain amount of inner strength and the willingness to take a chance.  Egan is frightened at first, unsure of whether his leap of faith will turn into a fall, but by taking that leap he is able to find someone that is a perfect fit for him, bringing a calming sense of balance and harmony into his life.",1056758400,2,2287,4.820971867007673

Writer/Director Paul Thomas Anderson mixes drama and comedy well.  His use of music and surreal colours help give the film a dream-like quality.
The acting is excellent all across the board.  Sandler is excellent and Emily Watson turns in another great understated performance.  Luis Guzman and Phillip Seymour-Hoffman both turn in their usual strong performances.
Punch Drunk Love is a trying, yet satisfying film.
The DVD looks excellent, as does the packaging.  The extras are good, making this dvd well worth its modest price.",1056758400,,688,5.2
1214133,1,B00000G02H,"Let me begin by saying that I was extremely excited to see this film seeing as PTA's Magnolia is a personal favorite.  So I went into it expecting a film that had a lot to say and had brilliant characters.  This film is nothing like Magnolia, and I was very disappointed.  I watched just about one hour, and that was enough to annoy me thoroughly.  The check out associate at Blockbuster warned me as I was renting this that movie stunk.  I politely shruggled off her warning, writing her off as just a young teenager and probably watched it just because it had Adam Sandler in it.  I should have taken her advice, because whatever her reasoning, this movie [stunk].
All or most of the characters in the movie are very annoying, especially Sandler's seven sisters.  I realize it was an attempt to be humorous, but from the very start of it they just annoy the hell out of the viewer.  You can certainly see why Sandler's character is such a nutcase.  I could elaborate more on the sisters, but I won't.
While Magnolia had lots of characters with different stories going on at the same time, this film is just a bunch of mixed up pieces that don't make a bit of sense... the dramatic car accident at the beginning?? The piano??  Maybe it would have all been tied together in the end, but there is nothing in this movie to make you want to stay with it that long.
I will congradulate Sandler for being able to break his regular mold and be a serious actor in the movie.  It is a shame that the movie itself and story couldn't have been better, his talent was really wasted.  Hopefully someone else will give him a chance in a future film.  Emily Watson on the other hand, besides what I hear about her being a great British actress, she is an awfully ugly woman.  She looked to old for Sandler, she wasn't anything to look at on screen, and as far as I'm concerned, she can stay with film in the UK.
Although there are pleanty of thoughtful revelations in Magnolia, things that make you really think about life, there is no moments like this in PDL.  Nothing in the film seems to mean anything at all.  The only things I thought was brilliant was Sandler's scheme to get millions of flyer miles off the pudding cups.  They made it out to be crazy in the previews and in the film, but honestly, it is a genius concept.
Final wrap-up, stay away from this film.  It was a waste of studio money, acting talent, and it will be a waste of your time too.",1056758400,5,2445,4.336263736263736

And I'm so glad that I did. Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan, a sad and angry man bound to fits of fury. Okay, so he's passive-agressive. He's got seven sisters that are constantly hounding him, trying to set him up, and figure out what's wrong with him. One minute he's gentle and mild mannered and the next he is hostile and breaking everything in sight. When he meets Lena, (Emily Watson) he begins to slightly break out of his mold, displaying his puppy-dog need for love that we have seen in previous films.
Although this is a romantic comedy, it stretches the boundaries to a new shade of love, encompassing the dark and the light shades (literally in some amazing colorful scenes.)

However, those of you out there who honestly want to know what kind of movie this is before buying it or renting it I will give you what I wish I would have known before renting it.
Interestingly enough you have people who really loved it, or really hated it.  I go in the ""I hate it category.""  But oddly enough hardly anyone tells you WHY it's bad or good for that matter, although I haven't read all 109 reviews.  These are my reasons for hating it:
1. It made absolutely no sense.
2. Endless shots of silence and nothing
3. Bizarre - an example:  In the beginning, you, the viewer, are watching an empty road for dragging seconds (seems so much longer) then a horrific car crash happens, waking you up, then a truck pulls up and dumps a piano onto the driveway where Adam Sandler stands.  Then nothing, no explanation, just moved on to the next pointless scene
4. Scenes of moving colors Monopolizes the screen, feels like watching a lava lamp up close.
I just didn't understand the point.  Where is it going?  What happened?  Why?  Who?  Huh?  Perhaps it is ""artistic"" and for that people like it.  I on the other hand, feel like I just killed some brain cells.

BEST commentaries (not counting the secondary commentary on Boogie Nights with the entire cast).  Where are his insights into the look of the film?  The paticulars on the music?  The behind the scenes in the editing and scripting?  I only ask because he has been so good about it before.  This DVD, though it holds up to the theatrical version of the film falls short of being a great DVD.  We are given only two, that's right... TWO deleted scenes, from P.T. Anderson.

Through the eyes of Paul Thomas Anderson, love is created and beautifully crafted before the eyes of the audience through Punch-Drunk Love.
Adam Sandler absolutely shines as Barry Egen, a man who is deeply troubled from years of ridicule from his seven sisters.... A man who sometimes cries for no reason.... A man who doesn't like himself very much sometimes....
Emily Watson's character, Lean Leonard, is Barry's soul-mate.... A women who is desperately seeking love. Lena is a safe-haven. She is Barry's control for his moments of uncontrollable rage.
Punch-Drunk Love is a dark romantic comedy. The bend over laughing segments from Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison are no where to be found. For once, Adam Sandler is a real actor. However, you don't know whether you should laugh or cry when Sandler's character demolishes a restaurant bathroom or when he trips and falls with a cup of coffee while rushing is a love stricken manner.
By using vivid colors and overtones, along with music such as ""He Needs Me"" from the motion picture Popeye, Paul Thomas Anderson puts the audience into the lap of love.
As with all Paul Thomas Anderson movies, Punch-Drunk Love is about people.... Simple people with tremendous problems.
Avid fans of Rambo and American Ninja are advised to stay in the jungle and fight the good fight. Punch-Drunk Love is not your cup of tea. However, this is by far one of the greatest depictions of true love that has ever graced the big screen.

It opens on just another day in Barry's lonely and confusing life, and as the movie goes on, we see him grow as a person...not all in good ways. Barry represents many people out there; lonely, depressed, confused, angry at the world, low self-esteem etc. So right from the start, P.T. Anderson establishes his audiences interests. If you can't relate to Barry in any way, you will probably not enjoy this too much...even though you still may respect it.
The pace and style of this film are much different than Anderson's other films; Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, and Magnolia. Here we are treated to a once-in-a-lifetime experience and new genre that was invented by this film. You can most likely expect to never see a film like this ever again, it is truely unique and astonishing. Adam Sandler really does a fabulous job of his portrayal of Barry Egan, and should've been nominated at the Oscars.
What makes this film different, is it's visual style...I'd have to say almost a mix of cinematography from; Pulp Fiction, The Shining, and Anderson's own technique. It's very colorful yet dull at times. The colors in the film represent Barry's feelings at the moment and are really affective.
When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was hooked...right there and then. It's one of the only trailers that doesn't mislead you into thinking the movie is something that it's not. The musical score with the film is beautiful yet haunting at the same time which really gives the movie an extra magical touch.
The Two-Disc Special Edition Set is very nice, fitting the film very well. There aren't a truck-load of extras explaining most of the symbolism of the film, but I can guess that was done intentionally. Other than that, the picture and sound are above and beyond the Superbit par, and there are lots of fun and suiting extras. It's deadpan, yet quirky, and beautiful, and angry, and charming all at the same time.
The whole experience is very dreamlike, a dream that you never want to wake up from.",1056412800,,2117,4.724324324324324

1214167,5,B00000G02H,"You'll either think this is the most special movie you've seen in a long time or the most confoundingly stupid movie ever.  I happen to think that it is a wonderful film.  It shows that our greatest director working, Paul Thomas Anderson, is capable of practically anything.  If you truly love film, you have to see Punch-Drunk Love.  Watch it with someone you love and then you can argue about it afterwards.  I've always felt the best part of film watching are the conversations following the screening.  Hope this was helpful.",1056412800,,529,4.758241758241758
1214168,5,B00000G02H,"Adam Sandler takes his trademark innocent-naf-prone-to-sudden-bursts-of-violence character and creates an interesting, new variation on it. Barry internalizes everything as he tries, desperately, to control his world. He seems to suffer from an acute case of agoraphobia and constantly looks uncomfortable. PTA simulates this feeling by punctuating moments of silence with sudden, jarring blasts of sound. It is the presence of Lena who provides Barry with the calm and love that he so desperate needs.
Punch-Drunk Love is akin to a Technicolor Jacques Tati film, albeit starring Adam Sandler. Barry, with his ubiquitous bright blue suit and exaggerated physical mannerisms, echoes silent comedians of the past. This is readily apparent in a scene that ends with Barry dancing up and down a grocery aisle in a wonderful expression of pure happiness. It's a brilliant cinematic moment that is an absolute joy to watch.
This is an excellent DVD with a flawless transfer. The DTS soundtrack will loosen yer fillings and shake your room with its rumbling bass. The extras are appropriate for this rather abstract, oddball film -- the best of the bunch being the 12 minute extended mood music video entitled, ""Blossoms and Blood."" Although, the ""Mattress Man Commercial"" is hilarious!
My only caveat is that it would have been nice if PTA had done an audio commentary with Sandler. But I understand that he wants the film to speak for itself (the same reason why he didn't do a commentary for MAGNOLIA). Oh well. Still, this is an excellent two-DVD set for a truly impressive movie.",1056412800,4,1577,5.1400778210116735
1214169,5,B00000G02H,"Punch Drunk Love is not for the faint of Heart, the easily offended, or chick-flick dwellers. But, if you are open to an art-house left-of-center form of entertainment, you might want to add this to your library.  We saw this movie a week ago in Australia and we are searching an American website to see about ordering it because it isn't going to come out on video in Australia for a while.
Some of the fantastic direction in this film involves the use of sound. Sounds are amplified to the extreme. Absurdity is magnified.
It's supposed to be adam's break into drama. I for one laughed all the way through it, at least on the inside.  I felt bad for Adam's protagonist character but his situations were hysterical.  We have been quoting the line about the sledgehammer ever since.
Anger Management, with Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler, is a perfect film and we will own that one too but Punch Drunk Love ought to be a cult classic along the same genre as Harold and Maude starring Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon.",1056240000,,1009,4.532967032967033

It is a great ombination of his unique style of speed and intensity in a film, whil also bringing a new emphasis on his characters and less on events.  It is tighter and more succinct that Magnolia, and sufficiently darker than Boogie Nights.  And PTAnderson again puts brilliant actors (Hoffman and Guzman)in his supporting roles.  The only bad thing abut his movies is that it takes him two years to put another one out.  Enjoy!",1056153600,,604,4.695238095238095

7908632,5,B00000G02H,"I am not surprised fans of most of Sandler's movies are disappointed by this, as this is not an Adam Sandler movie in the sense that his others are. He does not handle any of the production or direction, just the acting of one character. As someone who has followed the career of the director, Paul Thomas Anderson, who has made classics like ""Magnolia"", ""Boogie Nights"", ""There Will Be Blood"", ""The Master"" and the debatably enjoyable ""Inherent Vice"", I find Punch Drunk Love to be uniquely stylish and thoroughly well-acted. Sandler ditches the air of superiority felt in movies directed by ""Happy Madison"", his own production company. He submits to an out of role character in this script and acts out the idiosyncrasies of Barry Egan to perfection. He's anxious, he's abused, he's traumatized, and he's alone. Emily Watson marvelously executed the role of a not-so-damaged but not wired completely straight woman looking for a connection, and her quick attachment to Sandler's character was totally endearing. This is an anxiety filled movie, it's existential and rough around the edges, and that is exactly the way it needs to be. To show just how quickly love can enter into the lives of people who definitely aren't ready for it, yet still make an impact large enough to leave every person involved better for it. A movie watcher who enjoys most Sandler movies will probably not like this movie as it is totally out of character for him. Movie watchers who enjoy movies for every distinct detail and are willing to submit to the wackiness of Paul Thomas Anderson's writing and direction are in for a real treat.",1470614400,18,1618,4.865942028985507

If it hadn't been for his voice, I wouldn't have thought it was really him.  The movie's music disturbed me.  I was hoping for a nice comedy to relax and easily laugh to one night on vacation. It was not that.  I was disturbed by the characters and the music made the experience more-unsettling.  I just couldn't finish the movie.

7908636,4,B00000G02H,"As someone who hated Magnolia with a passion, I was prepared to watch this then spend a half hour laughing with my friends about the other crappy P.T. Anderson movie that sucks just as bad as Magnolia.  I loved Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood, but I assumed this movie would mostly feature the arthouse-y, esoteric, cinephile douchienss that plagued Magnolia.  Here's the thing: It had all of that in droves, but it made me feel so good watching it that I loved it anyway.

Even as I'm watching it for the second time right now, I cringe a little bit at the fortuitous and overly symbolic use of the harmonium which looms throughout the movie like the monolith in 2001: ASO.  I can't stand the fact that PTA has Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing a sex trade worker for the thousandth time.  I hope some day we get a director's cut of There Will Be Blood that has him running that brothel or whatever that place was where Daniel went with his brother.  Anyway....

One thing that PTA movies always have is a great use of music that makes you feel exactly what he wants you to feel (the oil derrick fire in There Will Be Blood being my favorite).  This movie is no exception.  Frenetic, anxious music made me feel the stress and confusion Adam Sandler's poorly adjusted, emotionally fragile character feels when simultaneously dealing with extortion, running a business, and most scary of all for someone of his level of social adjustment, a girl.  And when things do go right, the soft, romantic tunes demonstrates the relief and pure bliss that discovering how it feels to open up and feel loved FOR your vulnerabilities, and not in spite of them.

This movie has a silly plot, a lot of cliches, and all the other stuff that people dislike about movies they feel are too artistic for their liking.  But it delivers the emotion perfectly, and that makes me appreciate all the touches that go into it, even as the ""bro"" in me wants to not give into that sort of thing.  Some of the negative reviews here talk about how unrealistic this movie is, and how the characters aren't relatable.  But anyone who's had self-esteem issues, anxiety, or God forbid, been afraid to talk to girls can pretty easily relate to the frustration and confusion of Adam Sandler's character.  The wild mix of love, fear and anxiety fluctuates and creates a wonderful tension that made me happy and a little nervous the entire time.  For all it's weirdness, the fact that it can have that big of an effect on me means that everything about this movie is just right.",1450051200,2,2543,4.580573951434879

However with that said this isn't the type of film that is extremely popular because of just how realistic, negative and dull it may seem. However to someone who can relate to these real problems and issues, this movie is excellent. The best romance movie I've seen. The conflicts within the movie are so real and the awkwardness and shyness are also very real. The acting is perfect and the overall tone of the movie is exactly what I loved. I won't spoil anything, but I will say this movie is different, not for everyone. Perfect for me however. There is also a sense of self empowerment in this film. When he started standing up for himself inspired me to tell all of my fake friends who are two faced to go F**k off lol. This movie is so deep, I just love it.",1444435200,,942,4.4508670520231215
