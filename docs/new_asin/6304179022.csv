828658,4,6304179022,"This is the third of Nick Park's incredible Wallace and Gromit series. It's certainly the most complex. There are lots more characters (including one with a speaking part), lots more cartoony gadgetry, and a great chase scence. That involves a truck, motorcycle, airplane, and flock of sheep - good stuff.

For all that, ""A Close Shave"" really isn't my favorite in the W&G trilogy. The love interest was a bit forced, for one thing, and the plot had a slightly serious tone that just didn't work for me the way the other W&G movies did. Well, I can't blame him for trying.

""A Close Shave"" is a worthy companion to Park's other W&G stories. It's kid-safe, with no real violence or adult themes, but still holds an adult's attentio. My attention, at least. Enjoy!

828659,5,6304179022,"I first saw this Wallace and Gromit film when it was run on Cartoon  Network. I loved it and I had to watch it again so I rented it and liked it  even more the second time around! And now I bought it!  In the film,  news gets around town that there's mysterious sheep rustling going about,  and it really gets suspicious when Wallace, the polite inventor and his  faithful pet dog Gromit are hired to clean the windows of a wool shop. On  that day, Wallace becomes hopelessly infatuated with shop owner Wendolene.  Little does he realize that she (or rather her evil dog Preston) is behind  the sheep rustling, and frames Gromit for his dastardly deeds. So it's up  to Wallace, Shaun and a slew of other sheep to get him out of jail and stop  Preston from slaughtering innocent sheep to make dog food out of.  All in  all groovy, very cute, and non-violent. I reccomend it to anyone at any  age! :o)",968889600,3,899,4.337349397590361
828660,5,6304179022,"I saw this video for the first time when babysitting and the kids had it.  I was surprised how engaging, charming and funny it was.  Saw it again when I borrowed it from my library and liked it even better the second time.  It's good for family viewing, for adult viewing if you like English humor,  are tired of the typical action or comedy movie and/or just want to pass an  enjoyable 30 minutes.  It's a great pick-me-up if you've been feeling down.  Wallace and Gromit are fun, the stories are interesting and not at all  dumb or childish in my opinion.  Shaun the sheep is adorable and Wallace's  interest in Wendolene Ramsbottom (:D) is fun too.  Absolutely wonderful!  A  must have!",959731200,8,689,4.549180327868853
828661,5,6304179022,"I had never heard of Wallace and Gromit when a resident on  my floor (I'm an RA in a residence hall at college) popped it in for everyone to watch.  For all of the 50 kids aged 17-21, PLUS a 5-yr old little brother, it was  hysterically funny.  The little boy was so amused that at one point we  thought he might be he crying - he could barely get the air back in to  start laughing again!  I must admit, I was a bit weary when it started,  because I assumed it would be childish and simple.  To my surprise, we were  all laughing non-stop!  You won't want to leave your seat!",943488000,10,576,4.008849557522124
828662,5,6304179022,"This is my favorite of the W&G series, although they are all wonderful.  Poor Wallace almost finds love, only to be undermined by his passion for cheese.  And the look Gromit gives Wallace after being shot in  the face with the soap is priceless.  I can almost imagine the frustration  of being mute and working for someone who is clearly an intellectual  inferior.  Truly for kids of all ages.",917481600,,394,4.6231884057971016

828775,5,6304179022,Wallace finds himself a woman.  That in itself is pure comedy.  The fact that this woman owns a knitting shop makes it even more fun.  How does Gromit fare with this newfound love?  Watch!,1405728000,,188,4.4411764705882355

828778,5,6304179022,Nick Park did it again! My son loves Wallace and Gromit and really likes this one. Some scenes Might be a bit scary for kids under 5.,1394668800,,133,3.962962962962963

828843,5,6304179022,"No kids in our house, but that's not to say this DVD isn't appreciated. When things get a bit much & I need a laugh, I still like to pop this into the DVD player & watch it.",1365465600,,173,3.5789473684210527
828844,4,6304179022,"Only rated down because of its short running time. It only includes the one short and some filler extras. I didn't buy the collection, which is a better deal,  because I already own ""The Wrong Trousers"" separately as well.

This is the best of the 4 shorts out there. This is the story of the great sheep rustle by a rouge ""Robodog"" and introduces ""Shaun"" the shorn sheep""  character later used in a BBC series. (Also avail. on DVD) Hilarious! Very clever use of typical Wallace & Gromit / Rube-Goldburg gadgetry. Makes fun of several movies including ""Terminator"".

The only W&G that is better is ""The Were-Rabbit"" movie which you must own if you like this series. Also recommended:  ""Chicken Run"". All by Aardman Studios and also stop-motion-animated, which is a dying art.",1359590400,,775,4.796992481203008

828847,5,6304179022,"I have seen all four shorts (A Grand Day Out, The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave, A Matter of Loaf and Death) as well as the full length movie ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"", and out of all of these gems this film is by far my favorite.  The pace of the movie is just right, I love the developing romance between Wallace & Wendolene and the movie is chock full of delightful nonstop family friendly humor.  Of all the films I also found this one to have the most in terms of exposing non-Brits to aspects of British culture.

Just about the ONLY drawback to this film is that it was meant to be seen in anamorphic widescreen, but Lionsgate seems to have a consistently bad habit of producing almost all of it's DVD's in ""pan-&-scan"" full-screen only, making a loss of over 33% of the intended picture ratio.  I believe Lionsgate's business strategy is to only produce full-screen W&G films to DVD, but to then offer proper widescreen versions on BLUE-RAY disc only.

That aside, of all the W&G films I recommend this one the most and it should be an instant classic for many years of family viewing!",1254009600,,1098,4.442786069651741
828848,5,6304179022,A Close Shave is a wonderful movie. A definite classic that both children and adults can really enjoy. Definitely add this one to your Wallace & Gromit collection - it's a must have!,1252713600,,182,4.545454545454546

828851,5,6304179022,"This is my favorite Wallace and Gromit adventure, by a close shave over The Wrong Trousers. The characters have more depth, the plot is more complex, there's more dialogue, and Gromit is more emotionally involved and endearing. I think this third installment in the trilogy established Nick Park's brilliance, which led to his ongoing success in feature films.",1129420800,,360,5.224137931034483
828852,5,6304179022,"A Close Shave wasn't quite as good as the other two, but it's still a great video. In this one, Wallace & Gromit have a new window washing service. One day, they are called to wash windows and a store where Wallace meets Wendolene, the owner of the shop. She is nice but her evil dog, Preston, is up to no good. He has planned to steal Wallace's latest invention, the Knit-O-Matic and use it to make sheep into dog food.
