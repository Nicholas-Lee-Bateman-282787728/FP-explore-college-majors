7854979,5,6303672353,"Two charismatic young women from different backgrounds meet when they hitchhike. One is a country girl who happens to be in the city. The other is a city girl student who has tired of her goals. Each was supposed to go her own way at the end of the ride. However based on a mutual dare, they decide to see how long they can get by together living on their wits. They mostly beg by day & sleep in barns at night. Then voila they stumble onto a gun & head for the point of no return (they get there). Made before Thelma & Louise,the ending is stronger & not corny.",1121040000,3,562,4.072072072072072
7854980,5,6303672353,"I saw this film on British TV in the very late '70s (I think it was actually released in '77, not '79 as it states here), and I've been waiting 25 years or so to see it again.  That's how powerful and, to use an over-used word, haunting this film is.  I can honestly say that the two hours I spent watching this back then has stayed with me ever since.  A mesmerising study in alienation that evokes the psychic disintegration and ennui of Europe in the '70s.  Sounds dull?  It isn't.  It's like nothing you'll have ever seen.",1077062400,7,526,4.262626262626263
