8310952,3,B001IHDM86,"Roanoke was England's first, failed attempt at colonization in the new world.  Unfortunately, it was doomed from the start because of a number of factors - from poor planning and lack of communication with the mother country to hostile relations with the natives and uncooperative ship captains.  It got so bad that the colonists sent a representative back to England to plead their case for assistance.  Because of war with Spain, however, he was not able to return for three years...and when he did, he found that...(well, the title of the program is ""the lost colony,"" isn't it?).

England did eventually establish a foothold in America, of course, after learning some hard lessons at Roanoke.  Unfortunately for the colonists there, Roanoke represents England's first ""growing pains"" in America.

Three stars.  A textbook example of how NOT to run a colony!",1227657600,,861,5.107142857142857
