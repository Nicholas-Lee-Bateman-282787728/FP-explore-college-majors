All I am going to say about ZZ is that this is the most under rated Gundam series ever, trust me I have seen and own every Gundam series. However, chances are if you are interested in buying this on blu ray then you have already seen the series. Moreover, I am going to talk about the quality of the product. I have a very large collection of blu ray disc including a lot of anime. I can honestly say that both ZZ and Zeta are the most beautiful transfers of a cartoon I have ever seen. Watching both series on blu ray is really a completely new experience. From my experience when it comes to owning an older anime series on blu ray, bandai visual are is the king of HD remasters. I not only own ZZ on blu ray but also 08th MS Team, Zeta, CCA, Unicorn, and F91 on blu ray. I also have Wings of Honneamise, Akira, Macross, and Macross Plus on blu ray. Each of these titles have been transferred by bandai and it is safe to say that these are the best these shows will ever look. Now on the subject of what comes with the collection you not only have the best video quality possible for this series but you also have incredibly detailed art covers, amazing slipcases, as well as a book of episode summaries, character designs, and mech designs. Furthermore, I would only recommend this for the most hardcore Gundam fan due to the fact that there is no English audio or subtitles.",1372982400,4,1445,4.2202166064981945
