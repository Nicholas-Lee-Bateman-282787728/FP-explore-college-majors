3643505,5,B001HQZJWK,"I watched Degeneration in NY Horror Film Festival. At first I didn't expect a lot from this movie, cause the live action trilogy is very disappointing and I just didn't dare to expect it would be good, but it is. If you're an RE fan, it's a must-see movie. You won't be disappointed. Luckily the movie doesn't focus on fighting zombies too much. It is a drama/thriller. The movie successfully combines T & G-virus storyline fans are familiar with. Although not much character development, you can enjoy the story. CG part in my opinion is not as good as Final Fantasy. Characters' facial expression is a little stiff, and their ""stares"" are dull. Women look like they had plastic surgery. But these are not serious problems, just the technical parts they need to improve. Degeneration story is much better than FF. After watching its premiere, I can't wait to buy the DVD.",1227139200,30,872,4.743421052631579
3643506,5,B001HQZJWK,It is as described. All three animated movies in glorious HD plus extras such as gag reels.,1518393600,,91,4.411764705882353
3643507,5,B001HQZJWK,"Vendetta could have been done a bit better, so I'd recommend watching that one first. Seeing a younger Chris and Leon made it interesting though, as well as it having Rebecca Chambers, who I wasn't very familiar with beforehand.
Degeneration was better, but lacking a little excitement, so that's best as the second. Great seeing Claire and Leon in action though.
Damnation was amazing. Stayed up late one night just to watch that one. Exciting and full of interesting characters.",1517961600,,480,5.0125

3643510,3,B001HQZJWK,"The first two films in the series are an absolute must for Biohazard fans. I highly recommend the animated version over their live action counterpart. The 3rd film ""Vendetta"" really irritated me. For one the new rendering of Leon is horrible! He was so handsome in ""Damnation""! ""Vendetta"" was an absolute bore for me. The first two are good but I adore ""Damnation"" The most. If they make a fourth installment, hopefully they will take their time and not  present us with rushed content and a transparent plot. If you're out to collect,then go for it. If not, then skip the triple feature and purchase what you do like separately.",1515456000,,629,4.718181818181818

3643523,3,B001HQZJWK,"This is a CGI film that deals with the Resident Evil game-world, with Alice nowhere to be seen.  This one concerns some intrigue involving the deadly G-Virus.  Zombies get off a plane that has crashed landed in an airport terminal.  The movie begins with a litany of bad news and protestors dressing like fake zombies.  It quickly turns into a rescue mission in a dark terminal with only three agents to deal with the increasing zombie menace.  As if that wasn't enough of a crisis, theres also a problem with a drug company that peddles an anti-zombie medication and a terrorist who is trying to expose them.  Pick your villain.

An interesting entry in the franchise, albeit a fringe episode, with animation that at times borders on the creepy.  Trying to make the characters look real is its greatest downfall; all of the people look plastic and decidedly unreal.",1499904000,,866,4.76510067114094

I especially was irked by and ended up hating the girl's screamingly fudged up immoral actions that put so many at risk for a murdering brother who should have been shot by her early in the film.  Hated that girl so the ending just sucked when she was rewarded despite her narcissistic actually criminal behaviors.  She should have been killed the first time she cut her brother a break.  On 2nd thought, I'm changing this to two stars solely because of the writer's creation of that girl.  BAH!",1462320000,,652,4.785714285714286

3643568,5,B001HQZJWK,So much action! So much to see while watching this film! I like that they put it into a 3D thing because it makes it less gory and less scary. I still have  a question in my mind though...why is Leon's hair still the way it is even after fighting off all those zombies? What product did you use Leon? Mind sharing it?

3643571,4,B001HQZJWK,I do like that they try to make CG movies with characters and plots from the game.  The acting is not the best nor is the character movements.

3643579,2,B001HQZJWK,"I didn't think the CGI was very good. It'd be pretty good for a video game but as a stand alone movie not to much. It's not bad given it was made in 2008 but doesn't stand the test of time very well.

Graphics aside, it flows like a video game and I mean that for the worst. The characters have all the depth and dimensions of a first person shooter. The tactical operators (SWAT guys, or SRT) come off more as totally inexperienced caricatures of how some basement dwelling nerd thinks these guys are which is horribly frustrating. The male is a typical ""Hoorah!"" shouting meat head and the female an overly passionate and emotional. Both act as if they've never spent a day out of the academy or shooting range. The ""government agent,"" sports and emo-haircut and grizzly voice. The villainous senator is a fat-cat (literally fat) slime-ball. There is literally zero thought put into any of the characters. Just video game cliches which were novel the first time I played the original RE games as a kid but are so dated now it's literally laughable.

This movie makes the live-action one look like an academy award shoe-in. I enjoyed the live action re-imagining as an entertaining action movie, I didn't expect there to be any seriously deep characters or plot lines but at least some of the actors actually put on a human tone to role. These however are more like a selection of cut scenes from a PS2 game. I literally cannot overstate or express how terrible the characters are in this movie. I'd have been okay with it if it was free, part of Amazon Prime Instant Video, but even the few dollars I spent renting this were too much.

The frustratingly cliche characters are too distracting to enjoy this movie as a fan-service action movie. At least the live action movies had some enjoyment from the action-entertainment and excellent effects.",1423612800,,1848,4.662576687116564

3643582,4,B001HQZJWK,I have been a huge fan of the R.E. games since the first was released in 1998. I was dissapointed with the live action series. When i found out the animated films were made by capcom i had to see them. After watching it i have to say it is a good movie. The cgi is a little rough but the plot and the fact that the main character is actually from the games instead of a made up character like Alice in the live action films makes this movie worth watching.,1422316800,,456,3.967391304347826

3643588,4,B001HQZJWK,"I only bought the Blu-ray steelbook version of the movie because the case for it is pretty awesome and very shiny too I might add. I already owned this movie before on standard dvd and I enjoyed It. Though in comparison for Bluray and regular DVD I didn't notice much of a difference at all for quality, so either I'm blind and cant tell the difference or there isn't much for a difference to begin with, if this kind of thing matters to you all.

I'm not going to go into super detail about the film since I know there is plenty of people who have done it already, I enjoyed this movie way more then the live action abominations, since it actually is tied in with the game series compared to just taking this and that and ignore all source material. So fans of the games will like it or hate it. Fans of the live action movies that check this out would be pretty confused or not like it perhaps. My dad who seen only the live action movies saw this with me and was like ""wait how does this tie in?""

Overall it's worth a buy or a rent.

Oh also the 2nd disc that comes with this steelbook version with the extra titled ""project Alice"" is just a 22 minute video with the cast of the live action movies and director talking about how much the movie is like the game!

However, I will admit, the cgi animation was very lacking and could've offered more. The animated characters seem stiff when they walk, and some motions they make seem overly exerted. Facial expressions are lacking as well, and when the characters talk they move their lips like goldfish. Again, not a bad movie, just crappy cgi.",1391558400,,488,4.963414634146342

3643643,3,B001HQZJWK,"For gamers, I guess it will please more than Hollywood versions. Because it has some of the cannon characters, instead of pushing they around miss Jojovich story, with no good reason...

(I think those Hollywood R.Evil movies would be better without Chris, Jill, Leon, Claire, etc.. After all, everybody in RE universe would be doing their best to survive, and there would be plenty of room for a lot of people to live in that universe, without even ever cross path with REvil game characters)

But it was the first try, and... gosh, they made terrible mistakes. First, the facial mocap made Leon ressemble a robot.

(although Claire is just perfect. So I guess was the acting for Leon, because in Damnation director Makoto Kamiya asked all the actors to exagerate facial expressions)

Second think that irritated me: Angela character. I was very much annoyed by Ashley Graham ""Leon help me"" all the time in game REvil4, but a Special Response Team member should be less helpless than Ashley, shouldn't she? But Angela was made only to carry a gun arround, because Leon was the one that always saved her... Ashley would be better, definitely. At least she was really helpless.

The worse is the ending. I would advice you to stop the movie after the bad guys go to prision. Do not continue. Because if you do, you will see the worst dress I've ever seen in a female character (My gramma would not use a dress like that!). And that ending will not add anything meaninful for REvil universe, believe me.

I guess it is just OK, because at least the plot - even with this useless sidekick - add something to REvil story. Beginning with a uncontrolled virus in RE 1 and 2, trying to controll through REvil 4 through Las Plagas and mixing it with Degeneration (Virus and Vaccine), things are being conducted to REvil 5 and 6.

But keep only on the story, because everything else (except Claire) was very hard to endure withnot turning off my BD.",1351728000,,1940,4.6384839650145775

We have the return of zombies, the G-virus (and its funky huge eyeball mutation) and more conspiracies involving bioterrorism.

3643645,4,B001HQZJWK,"Being a Romero zombie fan (shambling, and not running), I really liked the Resident Evil games. The mythos is interesting, if not a little ridiculous at times, and when the live action films came out I expected the game-to-live action movie curse: most live action movies based on games bomb, fantastically. I was pleasantly surprised that they were event watchable, however, this movie has come through!

It's faithful to the games, and mythos, so if you enjoy the Resident Evil franchise, like myself, there aren't any moments where you have to just -accept- a major plot or character change. The CGI was top notch, much as it is in the games. The story is well paced and exciting. This movie is a must get!",1348444800,,709,4.717741935483871
3643646,3,B001HQZJWK,"Degeneration is a more or less standalone story set in the universe of the Resident Evil/Biohazard video games (as opposed to the Milla Jovovich films). Series standbys Leon and Claire must escape from an airport that becomes overrun from the walking dead, then investigate the larger conspiracy surrounding the zombie attack. There are some subplots involving expendable army mooks and a highly suspect senator, but this is secondary to the hardcore zombie mayhem, which ranges from the predictable (oh no a zombie ambushed the soldier who just finished shooting up all the zombies) to the awesome (plane crash where the plane releases hordes of the walking dead; a collapsing mad science fortress full of monsters). Fans of the games will enjoy some inside jokes- Claire sets off to battle zombies with an umbrella corporation promotional umbrella, and a frustrated Leon channels many gamers' frustration when he delivers a lecture about the importance of saving ammunition.

The real weak point of this movie is the CG. Structures and machinery look quite good, and the special effects such as smoke and fire are well realized, but the characters look cartoony in a way that doesn't fit the realism of the rest of the film, and their motion is jerky and unrealistic, probably as a result of only partial motion capture. The end result looks less like a movie, and more like a speedrun of an unreleased Resident Evil game, albeit one with a great lighting engine.

PROS
-Above average zombie thriller plot that meshes nicely with the games
-Some good action setpieces
-Stuff that isn't people looks pretty good

CONS
-Wacky looking characters make this film look cheaper than it probably was
-Some voice acting is pretty flat

STUFF TO WATCH FOR
-Everyone bitten by a zombie in this film becomes a zombie themselves. If that's how the T virus works, I'm not sure how I made it through the first 3 games as a human being.
-During the flashback to the events of the early games, Leon and Clare turn in place without moving their legs at all while fighting zombies (like in the games). I don't know if this is intentional.",1346371200,,2121,4.867036011080333
3643647,4,B001HQZJWK,"Resident Evil:Degeneration(Oct/2008)is a nice CGI animated supplement to the RE series of movies and vid games. Like Final Fantasy,this movie came straight out of Japan and the animations' looks are very reminiscent of that film,right down to the detail of the hairs on their collective heads. That this is based on a vid game is obvious,and I found myself wanting to take control of the picture(the shooting sequences especially),via some imaginary controllers!
The plot involves the Umbrella Corp.,of course. But this is the aftermath of the explosion,the nuking of Raccoon City. The T-Virus is now being sold to terrorist organizations that threaten to spread the virus worldwide unless their petty demands are met. Claire Redfield,working as an agent for an organization that does `clean up`after biological attacks,is at Harvardville Airport to meet some friends. As they are about to leave an airliner comes crashing into their section of the airport,which post-crash starts spewing out T-Virus infected people. The Marines along with a special agent by the name of Leon Kennedy,assisted by the SRT(Special Response Team)led by one Laura Bailey,come to their rescue. In the group stranded inside the airport,is one Senator Davis, who has more involvement in this whole mess than is at first suspected.
Once out of harms way and in an encampment and detainment area set up by the government right beside the airport,the group is pondering what just happened and their future path,when a company called WilPharma comes in loaded with doses of an antivirus. It seems WilPharma has taken over manufacture of the antidote where Umbrella left off. A rep of WilPharma,Frederic Downing,is there to oversee the distribution of the anti-virus,when the trucks suddenly explode,leaving them all seemingly helpless.
Downing offers to take Claire to the WilPharma facility and show her around. She accepts,but while both are in his office he receives a call from the Senator. It seems the Senator doesn`t want any info getting to Claire. Downing however fills her in on some of the research,introducing her to the G-Virus,a companion to the T-Virus,but totally uncontrollable. When Downing excuses himself Claire phones Leon to tell him what she has just learned. As she is talking to him Downing calls saying there is a bomb in the facility and to evacuate it. At that moment she spies Laura Bailey`s brother Curtis entering the facility with a suitcase. Curtis is against the research Umbrella and WilPharma have done and is trying to expose the truth about the big coverup which stretches to the highest level of the government. At that moment an horrendous explosion rocks the complex. Claire wakes up to witness a good portion of the interior offices exposed to the air.
Laura and Leon race to help Claire. By the time they arrive Claire has been making her way to the top of the facility,while Laura meets face to face with her brother who has injected himself with the G-Virus and is turning into something VERY non human. A group of Marines also arrive and begin firing on the mutated Curtis. They think they kill him but he keeps coming back,stronger and stronger. Meanwhile the entire WilPharma facility is going into shutdown and disinfection and it is a race against time to not only retrieve the WilPharma data but for all to escape. Laura and Leon do a long running battle with Laura`s brother while Claire retrieves the data.
In the end the facility is totally destroyed and the three,post escape,go their separate ways. The film itself ends as we see a dead Senator Davies with a newspaper over his head whose headlines pronounce the entry of another pharmaceutical into the picture. The company`s hazmat suited employees are seen sifting through the WilPharma wreckage,seeking remnants they can plie for viral activity.
It`s a well thought out plot,although the action starts getting slightly tedious 3/4 the way through the film. The action,once it gets going early on in the film,almost never stops. The animation itself,as mentioned,is excellent and very detailed.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and is in a w/s a/r of 1:78:1. Extras include character profiles,a featurette on the making of the film,an interview with ``Leon``,scenes re-voiced with some funny dialogue,trailers and a look at the then upcoming and new vid game Resident Evil:Five. I bought that game and have played it more than a few times. Despite its controls which take a bit of getting used to,it was a not too bad sequel. The version of the DVD I have came with a Resident Evil:Degeneration T-Shirt(a large and a good quality Fruit of the Loom besides!).This was a limited edition that I snapped up ages ago(shows you how far behind I am).
All in all a good animated sequel/chapter in the Resident Evil series of movies and vid games. A nice and moving plot which gets a little tedious a good way along but manages to keep up the hurried pace and interest factor until the end.",1340496000,,4979,5.021765417170496
3643648,1,B001HQZJWK,I saw no place in the description that stated that this was an animated version of the movie series.  For the movie itself I might have given it a 3 rating (since I couldn't go 2 1/2).  Warn viewers of this discrepancy.,1339459200,3,219,4.190476190476191
3643649,5,B001HQZJWK,"I loved the first Resident Evil film.  I'm a huge fan.  I really didn't like either of the two sequels, although the third was the worst IMO.  I skipped over this movie hundreds of times because, as another reviewer said, I assumed it was just going to be tripe trying to milk the franchise for a few more bucks (hence the animation vs. live actors).  I didn't want to waste any more time watching my favorite flick being butchered again.  Kind of like the living dead movies killing the original... a touch of irony perhaps!

Yet here I am, 18 minutes into the animated fourth film, and I am LOVING it.  Maybe it gets worse later, maybe it has a lousy ending, I don't know.  But so far the story is great and the animation is working for me.  It's more the CGI stuff they use in video games than straight-up animation which I think is partly why.  Some of the body language is really nice in detail - vey human.  I like the characters, and I like the way the story is unfolding.  Personally I find it suspenseful and intelligent.  I'll be back to edit this review when i'm done watching it.

UPDATE: ok... the next 20 minutes or so were kind of blah.  There's a lot of character exposition that is very contrived - motivations and so forth.  But, eventually the story and action pick up and while the very ending is a little lame, overall it was much better than I expected and compared favorably to the the other two sequels, which with their live action and relatively big budgets should have blown something like this out of the water.

By the way, I've never played the game.  I'm just a big fan of the first movie.",1339200000,,1620,4.343333333333334
3643650,3,B001HQZJWK,"I've seen RE: Degeneration in several different local Dollar General stores in my area. Finally, I got the chance to buy it after having some interest in seeing it. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what made me want to buy it. I was never that big of a fan of the games and truthfully I only own and have played the first two games plus Resident Evil 0. Of the three two I only played through two of them once. But something did and I bought it.

I knew beforehand that the game took place within the games' universe and had no relation whatsoever to the live action movies, of which I only ever saw the first movie. It just so happened to star Leon and Claire from RE 2, the only Resident Evil game I ever had the will to play through more than once.

The movie picks up a few years after Resident Evil 2 and 3 (the games take place at the same time) with the destruction of Raccoon City. Claire is now working for a group called Terra-Save which opposes biological warfare and Leon is working for the government as a special agent. The two meet when Leon is sent to handle a situation at a local airport when a terrorist attack happens causing the T-Virus to infect people on a plane and in the airport itself ultimately leading to figuring out what happened and who was behind the attacks.

Being entirely CGI, of course that has to be talked about. I've seen better CGI. Not that it was bad but it was almost like just a somewhat upgraded quality of what Toy Story looked like in 1995, just in a more dark or gritty fashion. This would have been impressive in the late 90s, basically. Today it's just mediocre compared to other CGI I've seen. Some instances I thought could have been done better and I found distracting. Like there's a scene with Leon talking to Claire. It's like watching a robot who's ONLY workable moving part is his mouth and everything else is frozen in place.

All in all it was an okay movie. I can't say it's a movie I'll pop in a lot, but I'll watch it again. It was a fun watch.",1337558400,,2005,4.254593175853018
3643651,2,B001HQZJWK,"I had been a fan of the Resident Evil movies, but I am by no means a gamer. It was a lazy Monday night, and I felt like watching a zombie movie, so I figured this animated film might be worth a try. I was dead wrong (pun intended)! Coming out of this movie, I feel like I've been cheated 1 hour 36 minutes of my time (2 hours if you count writing this review). The animation is so-so and comparable to those of straight-to-video movies that litter the bargain aisle. To their credit, the first 30 minutes of the movie with the zombie action was okay. After that the story line just went downhill, bordering on ridiculous. And what is up with the strangely awkward sexual tension between the two main characters every time they avoid sudden death? There's several 3-second pauses where they just stare at each other and do nothing. Throughout the movie, the characters just evolved into nothing more than bloated American stereotypes probably invented by some foreign script writers/video game designers. A five year old could've written a more believable plot line. The lines were extremely cheesy too - ""Maybe we could go diving sometime"" as a goodbye/thank-you to the person who just saved your life? Really?? Do people say that in real life?  It was that bad.

3643652,2,B001HQZJWK,"I bought my copy from Target I think... anyway I'm a huge RE game fan, or at least WAS, this entire film is just one cliche from the RE mythos after another empty meaningless signpost that is supposedly pointing the fans into a boring horror flick and stiff CG animations. It's poorly realized technically compared to the modern standards set for CG by film like Avatar, the animations are awkward and old school in the way they seem to be more scripted and mapped out rather than modern motion captured, so I don't know and haven't researched to see what techniques the animators actually utilized, don't care because either way they failed. The film is stiff, unexciting, boring and meaningless to me and I own 95% of all RE games ever created. This movie does nothing for me and I had hoped that it would, and that more would continue as a new source of enjoying the RE world.

3643657,3,B001HQZJWK,"This is Capcom's first attempt at a full CG only movie, and it's not too bad. This film has some clich parts, but since it's a resident evil film you kind of look over it. This movie ties in Resident evil 2/3(What happens in the aftermaths of raccoon) and Resident evil Code veronica/4 (Continuing the story of Claire and Leon) and leads up to the events in Resident Evil 5. I think this is pretty cool how they tie these stories in with the franchise, hell it even slightly ties in with the movies (Claire and raccoon city).

The story is ok, but the whole ""screaming girl"" has been old for years now, and got annoying during this film. The coolest parts are the tie in with the series, the Zombies, and the details of the guns. Not much really shines during the story, the dramatic events fail, and the only other movie that has more staring than this is Twilight. I mean how many movies have to do the pull away when someone is getting attacked by a zombie before they realize it got old years ago.

The graphics are pretty good, especially for a CG only movie. While it's not good as Resident Evil 5, the guns look great, and the people look semi real. Another part that looks good is when they shoot the zombies and the way they die is pretty detailed. The buildings do look pretty cool, and kind of has its own unique look to them.

The acting is pretty good, and I believe they used the same voice actors for Claire and Leon that worked on the previous games. Everyone else, eh they are sub-par, and it feels like they are reading it off a script. I even think one of the voice actors in this movie also voiced a character in Resident Evil 5.

The special features are pretty cool, with about thirty minutes of behind the scenes footage and talking about this film in the franchise of Resident Evil. While it's all Japanese dubbed, it's watchable with subtitles and you really don't notice it. The ""Bloopers"" are pretty entertaining and some of them actually made me laugh. They provide character profiles, but it's just 1-2 paragraph's about the characters and not like a timeline of what they have been in.

Overall I say to buy this if you're a fan of the Resident Evil franchise; Especially 5, since I believe what happens in this movie is what Chris talks about in the opening credits.

Positives:
* Nice tie in with the RE franchise
* Well made guns via CG
* Finally nice to see Claire is something new after years
* Cool zombies
Negatives:
* Most voice actors suck in the movie
* Annoying screaming zoom in? Really?
* Sub-par story",1326758400,,2570,4.409282700421941

The way I look at it is they're different takes on a similar situation. Anyways this movie is definitely worth the watch if you're a hardcore Resident Evil fan. It's got plenty of action, and two very excellent hero's; Leon S. Kennedy, and Claire Redfield. Resident Evil fans, this one was made just for you, enjoy.",1307318400,,426,4.545454545454546

Lots of death and adult themes, but you probably expect that.

Fun characters (completely vile politician is fun to root against)...helps if you already know the story though.

Of course there are the logical errors like, what about some body armor, and the mouth movement mismatch (but since forced HD tv and the elimination of antenna tv that's way more common-place), but is skin texture so hard to do? maybe. i don't know. and for awhile there, no-one was blinking! The cliches are a bit annoying too- evil senator (were the jowls an afterthought? those were oddly drawn), brooding permanently scowled hero who needs a hair-cut (the entire time- hair in front of the eyes-ugh), smoking villain. I mean you shouldn't want to see your hero get killed. but i was looking for a movie, not a video game so perhaps i am not qualified to comment.

Nice touches- texture of the wooden planks of the floorboards, reflections in the glass in the tower, but there's no saving it if you say it helps the ""movie"" if you don't look at their eyes or their faces- esp the god-awful annoying hair in front of the eyes affection of the hero.",1299369600,,1118,4.534653465346534
3643665,5,B001HQZJWK,"There are already over 100 reviews so I'll keep this short.

I have been a huge fan of the RE series since playing the original. I still remember the dog jumping through the window and scarring the piss out of me and my friends. Classic moment. I own all of the original series (RE 0-5 and code veronica). I don't have any of the spinoffs on the Wii or handhelds.

If you like Resident Evil in any way, you should like this movie. It follows the traditional story path in the video game series set between RE4 and RE5, not the story path in the movies. The big screen version seems to be going it's own direction. Was there even an Alice in the video games? We have Jill, Chris, Wesker, Leon, and Claire as the main characters in the video game story. I hope they will make more of these CGI movies. This movie features Leon Kennedy. Great movie.",1298419200,,846,4.28125
3643666,4,B001HQZJWK,"Resident Evil: Degeneration is my favorite RE movie mainly because the story is really good. While the montion-capture animation of characters' mouths is ""off,"" and the dialogue is stilted in places, the characters are interesting and believable.  I like this much better than the overblown live-action RE films, and it's nice to see Leon S. Kennedy get screen time beyond the video games.",1294790400,,389,5.174603174603175

I enjoy all the games for every console, but was never a fan of the movies, they had some of the elements of what made the games so memorable, but lacked the original characters or mood that the games set. Degeneration ultimately helps get things on track for the RE mythology and is very enjoyable to watch. If you are an RE fan and can get over the fact that it is all done in CGI, sit back and get ready for the things that some up Resident Evil: Conspiracy, Bullets, and Zombies",1291420800,,586,4.1946902654867255
3643668,5,B001HQZJWK,"While this is very much a Resident Evil movie, it is a departure from the Alice franchising. Instead, we have someone that we followed through RE:4 coming out to visit, and he's brining up the ghosts of Africa with him as he prepares us for Africa. Apparently there's a company in Africa pretending to help but the only thing they seem to be managing is the creation of horrors. That is what Leon and Claire find as they look over the remains of places, and how this ties into the last two games. Its really good, too, because it shows some of the woes that the troops have faced. You see firsthand what the human monsters are doing, and you see what the monsters themselves have been getting to as well.

As far as a story, this is told well. The games have set up all of the story, but you don't have to play to understand. you simply have to pay attention to the developments and watch as the things begin to unravel before your eyes. What's more, a gargantuan thing gets loose in this entry and it tears through buildings looking for doom, a jungle gym, or something like that. Personally I thought this part was nice, and i thought the death it brought about was nice as well.

Also involved in this story is that lovely mix of CGI. It is a beautiful thing when you check it out, with the monster looking good and the people also loking good. The characters are ones you know and the voices are done well, so things go in a great direction. This made it a great movie and, sadly, one I couldn't tie in. Otherwise it would have been living the life of a ball strung up by this beautiful yarn.

If you are a fan, this is for you. It is not the movies you know, but it is the game you love. you do not have to play to know it, however, and the people die just the same if you have no idea who anyone is. i personally saw it as a reward for those who watched and played, hoever, but that is just me. It had shout-outs that are not plots or arcs but that have meaning in this set-up and that make me happy when I know what is what. This helps it round into a 5 star rating, but I also have some RE bias and know it as I write this (and include this information, which is not normal for reviewers).",1290470400,,2197,4.116550116550116
3643669,4,B001HQZJWK,"I love Resident Evil, it's the most unique and awesome zombie series I've ever known!

I first heard of this movie through a teaser trailer in the Resident Evil: Extinction dvd that I rented back in '08.
I was thinking, wow! resident evil in CG-with claire redfield and leon s. kennedy! (some of my most favorite characters!)

I knew that I just HAD to watch it...then I lost track of it. then I saw it on my on-demand menu on the tv. yay!
so I watched it...it's pretty good, the voice actors are always the greatest. the music is good.
the plot though, was pretty ok. but it strays off of the original story/plot in the video game series.

watching Degeneration is like playing through 'Resident Evil: Outbreak', it's a Sub-plot.

I've finally bought it and added it to my collection, it's definitely worth the buy-and the watch.
I think the Resident Evil series would be better off in CG than the live action films. (don't get me wrong, I like those too!) it would just be nice to watch Resident Evil as it should be rendered in CG on film. (plus the live action, too)

although, some people don't always like CG movies-and that's perfectly ok. some believe that Resident Evil should not
even BE a movie, that's ok too. (but I like it anyways) (^-^)

I won't spoil it for anyone, you'll have to check it out yourself~!

by the way...just so everyone knows, there IS going to be a sequel to Degeneration. (another CG movie, yay!)
it's going to be called 'Resident Evil: Damnation', and it's coming out sometime in 2012-at least in Japan! <3",1288396800,,1541,4.5215827338129495
3643670,3,B001HQZJWK,"CAPCOM finally went about doing a Resident Evil film in full CGI.  For returning characters Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield come back in this movie.  Although this movie takes place 7 years after the Raccoon City incident and at the same time there have been some references to the games throughout the movie.  While Umbrella has finally met their demise at the time that the movie starts which means, that there has to be a new company that's going to be replacing Umbrella or who is the mastermind behind the series of events that occur in the movie.  I have heard that this movie sets itself up prior to the Resident Evil 5 video game, which was released within a few months after the release of this movie.  Though many fans that have played Resident Evil over the years will see that this movie is more related to the games than the live action movies though that the live action movies are still have stuff from the games in them.

3643672,2,B001HQZJWK,"Wouldn't really suggest this unless you are really into Resident Evil, and then just for the insight into the RE universe.

The movie itself is quite cheesy with a video game style plot. The CG is about the same as what you would expect in a video game cutscene as well. Very little facial animation makes all the characters pretty dry and the voice acting leaves something to be desired as well.

It wasn't until Capcom decided to make their own movie, animated through CGI that we got a good RE movie. The story is a hell of a lot better than the life action movie following some terrorist releasing the T-Virus, and corporate espionage.

The main characters are Leon and Claire from Resident Evil 2. The are clearly brought to life through CGI. Along with other great characters you end up caring for. The voice acting is really well done, a excellent job.

Don't waste your money on this one. It's hard to explain why this movie is so bad without spoiling it... If you must know, the movie declines after the initial airport scene which lasts only maybe 6 or 7 minutes. Through the rest of the movie you'll just be scratching your head wondering what is going on.

Should you manage to actually watch this crap-fest the whole way through, you'll likely place it on a shelf (or preferably at the bottom of the ocean) to never watch again.

Don't believe me? Well then... I'd like to see your review of the movie after you watch it.",1252886400,,633,4.439655172413793
3643683,2,B001HQZJWK,"Think of a 97 minute cut scene!

ACTING: All I have to comment on is the voice acting of the characters. As usual, along with any other Resident Evil game, the voice acting is hit and miss. Some were really good and convincing, and some were just awful. Perhaps it's the lines that the characters have to say, I dunno.

PRODUCTION: The only thing that I can comment on here is CGI. I really thought before seeing this, that it would probably be an excellent CGI production. I was kinda disappointed. While fitting seemlessly into the Resident Evil game scenes, that's about it. I guess I thought that this would be above and beyond current CGI projects out there, but it seems dated and stiff. The plot, unfortunately, is very restricted to die hard Rez Evil players, as many references are made to events that happened in the games. If you aren't that hardcore of a Rez Evil fan, don't try to understand anything, because you will be lost.

ZOMBIES: The zombies in Resident Evil: Degeneration are the same types from the games. Slow, plodding and hungry. There is nothing really new here brought to the zombies here. I was disconcerned to find that the appearance of zombies was very minimal. While in the games, I realize that there were many more enemies (crows, dogs, lickers, hunters,etc.) I had hoped (especially after playing Resident Evil 4) that a return to old school zombies would be here, but no.

THE CAUSE: If you don't know by now, then why are you watching this movie?

NUDITY: None

FINAL: While I didn't hate this, I didn't love it either. I really thought that this would hold its own against the movie series and be more faithful to the games. While it could easily be placed into a game as cut scenes, it just didn't do it for me as a full length feature. Perhaps with higher production values (and more zombies), it could've been the movie it should have been.",1250726400,,1882,4.56973293768546

Well from my star rating you can see that it is a solid film, but that is the problem.  You would think that zombies,guns, and the ability to shoot from any angle and total creative freedom would equal a hot movie, not quite.  My biggest problem with this movie is that it seemed as if Capcom got togeter all of its computer artist and had them make the movie. This is not a good thing because the designs for the face and body design didn't quite match the building and special effects design of the movie.  It is distracting to have great designs of texture for clothes but the characters faces seemed to be out dateded.  As for the plot it is not really immersive and you will probably watch it twice to figure it out.  Action scenes are great but far apart, ""This is another major fault of the movie.

3643686,1,B001HQZJWK,"I've been caught up with the 3D idea of Resident Evil, since non of the other films seemed any good to me. As the movie is based on a game, then a 3D movie might be best option.

I got it on Blu-Ray for further joy of the graphics, but even that wouldn't save the frustration.

The story is very shallow, and until the end of the movie, you're actually waiting for the action moment of it. Also, the character the script are so lame you would be surprised how it got approved. When you want to show the bad side of a president, again, a president who should know better about politics, there are thousand better ways to show it than let him say ""I Hate Children"". Also, when the whole human race is at stake, you would see the main figures walking around, drinking coffee and exchanging smile. I kept thinking if I was following the movie straight or I missed something. How could that be?

The graphics of the objects was cool I say, but once it gets to humans, which matters the most, it's all solid, no emotions. It's lifeless.

I really support the 3D idea, but give it to a company that can deliver. Emotions are so important in thriller movie, and so is the story, and the twist.

Being A Huge Resident Evil Video Game Fan(Bought The Nintendo GameCube Just To Get The Resident Evil Games Made Exclusively For This Gaming Platform),I Have Been Somewhat Disappointed With The First Three Resident Evil Movies.
They Werent Terrible Movies,But They Didnt Follow The Storyline Of The Games Close Enough To Know They Were Barely Related(Kind Of Like Distant Cousins Twice Removed).

Then Finally The Computer Generated Movie Resident Evil:Degeneration Arrived.
In One Word ""AWESOME""!!!

The Movie Features Two Of The Video Games Major Charecters(Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield), And Their Appearance Is As Close To Their Video Game Version As Possible.

The Movie Sticks As Close To A Possible PlotLine For The Video Games As Possible(In Fact If There Was A New Resident Evil Game That Followed This Storyline,I Would Not Be Surprized).

I Have Already Watched This Movie Several Times And Find Myself As Drawn In To The Action As I Was The First time I Viewed The Movie.

The Picture And Sound Are Reference Quality,To Say The Least,And Make You Feel As If You Are In The Movie Watching The Action First Hand!

Resident Evil:Degeneration As Found A New Place As One Of My 20 Favorite Movies

5 Stars Easily For The Fans Of The Resident Evil Games.
3 To 4 Stars For Those Who Have Not Seen Or Played Any Of The Resident Evil Games

3643693,2,B001HQZJWK,"First of all, whille this movie is a good representation of Resident Evil, it's just simply not good. When I rented this movie, I didn't expect much from it, and guess what? It sucked just as much as I thought it would!

 Most of the movie consists of crappy dialogue and pointless other boring crap. For one thing, Leon Kennedy(the main male character) is pretty much neglected and badly interperated and bland. Where's all the crappy jokes from Resident Evil 4? The rest of the other characters(besides Claire Redfield) are just pointless attempts at a good mystery/horror movie.

 The first half of the movie consists of the main characters trying to get out of a zombie filled airport, which involves random scenes of zombie fights and attacks. It woks in the games, but not the movie. Then the second half consists of a weird mystery involving a mysterious company and some mysterious guy that eventually turns into a Tyrant-looking monster while the two leads try to fight him. Neither part of teh movie is any good what so ever.

 So while the movie is pretty horrible, I guess some people might enjoy the unfufilling action in the movie, but its just nothing compared to the flawless games. So to sum it all up, a crappy movie, but with some halfway decent action.

3643694,5,B001HQZJWK,"I sometimes sit and wonder, why or why couldn't this be the very first RE movie. To be honest I was not pleased with any of the movies the were released EXCEPT this one. All the others made up story lines and completely veer off the real stroy line and made a sort of ghetto version of ""Dawn Of The Dead"" type of movies. This movie hit the nail on everything that is RE. I am very proud Capcom took over and finally made something that the fans really can understand and be fimilar with, even if it is in CG. The story and everything was great. I give this movie five stars.",1237420800,,574,4.088495575221239
3643695,3,B001HQZJWK,"As stated in my title, this is a fun jaunt into the Resident Evil universe, but it's not mandatory viewing for fans.

The plot takes place directly following Resident Evil 4 game, and it sets up the events that will be seen in the recently released Resident Evil 5. The primary protagonists are Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield; the two main characters from Resident Evil 2.

Although Umbrella has been defeated, someone has unleashed a terrorist attack on a U.S. airport using the T/G-Virus, and once again it's a battle against time and zombies.  (And these are real zombies, not the Las Plagas.)  Claire is caught in the middle of the storm, and Leon is called to assist in the containment of the outbreak.  Neither Claire or Leon initially know each other is there.

While there's a tremendous amount of backstory involved for the uninitiated, the film is easily accessible to a casual viewer as a stand-alone, and they shouldn't have any problems following the story---though they will miss out on the numerous references and ""Easter eggs"" that were aimed directly for the game fans.

The plot was good, but slow in places.  There was a bit too much expositional drama and downtime, and not enough suspense or combat.  I don't mind fleshing characters out, but it seemed the zombie outbreak was secondary to merely introducing a new character; Angela Miller, who really has no impact on the mythos since she's brand new and thus far a movie exclusive.

I was also a bit miffed a good chunk of Claire's screen time was taken away by Angela, and an unfortunate consequence was a unfulfilling reunion between Leon and Claire.

Fortunately that's all the gripes I had.

The CG animation was very well done. Not quite photorealism, but consistent to what you'd expect to see in movie cut scenes on the 3rd generation gaming systems.  The voice talent was also good, and they thankfully used the same voice actors for Leon and Claire to maintain continuity.

It didn't hit a home run as I was hoping, but it did give a cool side story in the Resident Evil universe.  As a first time endeavor it showed potential, and this at least properly paves the way for future Resident Evil animated films.

If you have a passing interest in the Resident Evil game universe, or are a fan of CGI animation, zombies, or sci-fi/horror, it's worth checking out.  It probably won't blow you away, but for what it was, it was a nice diversion.",1237420800,,2427,4.699763593380615
3643696,5,B001HQZJWK,"This is a pretty good resident evil.  I liked it better than the movies.  Mostly because it is related to the games.  The CG was not the best I've seen, but still good.  I let a friend borrow it, and he's not familiar with the games, but even he liked it.  GET IT!!",1237334400,,265,3.9245283018867925
3643697,3,B001HQZJWK,"As a long-time fan of the series, this was a pretty good movie. I had heard many bad things from friends, so I didn't go into it with high expectations, but it was better than I thought it would be. Not a great film by any means, but it sure beats Resident Evil: Apocalypse.",1236556800,,274,4.092592592592593
3643698,4,B001HQZJWK,"""Resident Evil: Degeneration"" is an amazingly well animated feature length movie in the Resident Evil franchise. The movie captured the creepy feel of the Resident Evil games and live action movies.

No plot spoilers from me. Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield are back fighting T-Virus infected Zombies, this time in an airport and later in a research facility. The story line is strong and fits well into the Resident Evil universe. There are a few plot twists and even a bit of romance thrown in to keep it interesting.

This is a very watchable movie and the animation is so good that it is easy to forget that it isn't real actors on the screen.

Recommended for fans of the genre.",1236470400,,687,4.614754098360656

3643701,5,B001HQZJWK,"I watched this movie with very low expectation. After Final Fantasy: The Spirits within and Advent Children fail so bad, I'm not sure if any CG animation with real 'humane' characterization movie will satisfies me.

It is safe to say that I was very wrong. Although for whoever that are thinking of getting this movie, should be aware that this serves mostly as fan service to those who plays the game.

Don't get me wrong. I don't play the game (it's too hard for me), but I still enjoyed it thoroughly. The movie has plot, character development, and actions that's just fun to watch. If you're craving for more, you can also watch the special features, and you should pick up the previous story here and there. Still not satisfied? Wikipedia is your friend :)

Oh yeah, if you decided to get this movie, don't miss the 'voice bloopers'. It's so funny I was laughing so hard. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",1235865600,,913,4.588957055214724
3643702,3,B001HQZJWK,Now considering the Trilogy of Resident Evil films that had Nothing to due with the game besides name. This is a more intouch version that stays very true to the Resident Evil universe.,1235692800,,185,4.636363636363637
3643703,5,B001HQZJWK,"Okay, let me start off by saying that this movie isn't for everyone and that I am a huge Resident Evil fan. With that said, I really enjoyed this film. The basic premise is that terrorist have started using the T-virus to cause zombie outbreaks, which are being called bio-terrorism. Meanwhile Jill Valentine is waiting to meet up with some people at an airport, which happens to have people from her organization protesting a US Senator that happens to be in cahoots with a company that took over Umbrella's research after Umbrella's collapse.

At this point, I should note that unlike the previous 3 live-action films, this film is set in the game continuity, as it refers to the events of the past 4 RE games and sets up something for the fifth title.

Okay, now back to the film. Zombies show up in the airport, Jill is trapped inside trying to defend the senator, a little girl, and some other survivors. Meanwhile, Leon shows up and leads a small team inside to help rescue them. They escape, and the true mystery of who set this bio-terrorist outbreak loose begins.

The CGI wasn't that bad in this film, but it definitely wasn't comparable with Wall-E or Kung Fu Panda Blu-ray transfers. It was just okay. The dubbing was good, as Leon has the same voice actor that he had in RE 4, which is a good thing for continuity's sake. The writing on this isn't all that great, as I think some of the story and the drama was lost in translation, but overall, it's still good.

Overall, If you are a Resident Evil fan, then pick this up. If you don't care for the franchise, then this won't change your mind.",1235433600,,1606,4.489726027397261
3643704,5,B001HQZJWK,"just like Final fantasy advent children, or devil may cry the anime, this is how a videogame movie should be made, not for a new audience but for FANS of the game. whenever they make a game movie targeting the fans it always stay true to the game. RE is not just a movie but an adaption to the game series, and if youve played all the games then you will love this movie, right in time for RE5, great movie, i wish all videogame movies would stay CG..",1235174400,,451,4.078651685393258
3643705,5,B001HQZJWK,"Resident Evil Degeneration is a fantastic movie; one that every RE fan should own. It brings back fond memories of the second game (my favorite one). It's based around Leon and Claie obviously, but there are a few new original charcters thrown in to round out the story. The story is not perfect, but it is very engaging and exciting.

I highly recommend this movie.",1235088000,,366,4.630769230769231
3643706,4,B001HQZJWK,"Even though I've never played the game before and practically know nothing about the characters or the plotline I enjoyed the movie. As a fan of Devil May Cry it was hard not to like it seeing as we get to see the good guys shoot up the bad guys. Admittedly unlike Devil May Cry there are more politics and plots to be had in this movie, but the gunplay and action made up for most of those slow parts. All in all if you like the whole shoot up the zombies, gunplay, or Resident Evil in general you'll like the movie. Just don't expect a Final Fantasy Advent Children kind of quality in the animation.",1234310400,,601,4.189655172413793

Since I knew nothing of the series, I thought I would be thoroughly lost... not the case at all.  Even though this movie has a pretty complicated plot, it was well expressed throughout the movie.  I never felt lost, not once.

Check it out.  At the very least, rent it.  You won't be disappointed.",1233792000,,515,4.291666666666667

3643710,1,B001HQZJWK,"As the title states, the movie ""degenerates"" into nothing more than boring dialouge, short action sequences, confusing story, and subpar computer animation.

I am a Resident Evil fan; however, I found this movie extremely boring and poorly animated.  The cinema scenes in the actual Resident Evil video games are more exciting than this movie.",1233792000,4,343,5.333333333333333
3643711,2,B001HQZJWK,"The animation of this dvd is extremely well done along with the special features.  The faux Leon interview is funny (and cheesy) and the other ""spoofs"" are clever, such as the jealous Claire.  Unfortunately, these are the high points of the dvd.

 The stunning animation and artwork is lost in the clichs found throughout.  There is the nave and idealistic SRT team leader, the hot headed SRT team member, a little girl in distress, corrupt and greedy politician, greedy scientist, revenge and anger filled villain who will do anything to expose the truth.  Very disappointing.

 The storyline takes place after the second video game, thankfully, not the horrendously written live action Resident Evil 3 movie.  The storyline follows the video game world much more realistically with a new corporation taking over after Umbrella dissolves after going bankrupt from Raccoon City.

 The basic storyline is an evil scientist with a politician attempt to make T virus vaccine sales, but get greedy trying to sell the T virus as a weapon to terrorists.  In comes Leon to save the day and video game style, has to fight the tyrant in the finale.

 What creates the low points are the incredibly clich and stupid characters.  The SRT team leader, Angela is idealistic and rushes ahead alone trying to save ""victims"".  Despite being warned that a single bite can infect, she attempts to pick a victim up.  Leon saves her the last second only to have her complain why.  Leon then begins to shoot the zombies in the head, but Angela just stands their in panic mode.  Even when a zombie walks towards her, she shoots it in the leg, and of course, again panics, shocked that the zombie is crawling to her.

 Then Greg enters and being a hot headed macho man, shoots all the zombies with body shots.  Thinking that they are ""dead"" he walks off, only to have the crawling zombie crash through the glass to attack him.  Fortunately, Leon also shoots it in the head.  Greg gets up wondering what happened, completely ignoring what Leon previously briefed both of them before insertion.

 Meanwhile Claire, who survived Raccoon City is stranded in a zombie filled airport trying to protect a little girl.  Of course, she has no weapon to defend herself or the little girl, unless one considers an umbrella as a weapon?  But wait, Leon with the two SRT members finally arrive to the rescue and they all make a mad dash through the airport.

 In the attempt to escape, the girl gets knocked down and helplessly panics as the zombies close in.  Claire naturally jumps down and just hugs the girl with no weapon.  Claire makes no attempt to move the girl to a safer area, or stand ready to fight the zombies.  Only hug the girl protectively and wait to get bitten.

 Leon, who is fighting another zombie hand to hand, tosses his pistol to Claire.  Claire quickly shoots the zombies in the head.  Leon, he's not disarmed, for after pushing the zombie off, he takes his back-up pistol to shoot the zombie.  Yes, Leon held on to a back-up pistol while leaving Claire to run through the zombie filled airport unarmed, what?  And to top off the stupidity, Claire hands the pistol back to Leon while still in the airport.

 Needless to say, anyone who watches zombie movies, or played any of the Resident Evil games would go bonkers at the nonsense.  Who gives up their weapon to be unarmed and unprotected against infected zombies?  Everyone needs a weapon to fight off the zombies.

 To top it off, Leon, the President's Special Agent, has no special body armor against bites.  In real life, police who train attack dogs have full body suits to protect against dog bites.  They also make Kevlar sleeves and gloves to protect against knives.  One would imagine that if a special zombie fighting team was being sent in, they would be wearing chain mail, riot gear, or other bite resistant armor to protect against being infected.

 Unfortunately, the script makes Claire look like an inept damsel in distress and the good guys incredibly stupid in not having better equipment or weapons.  Fortunately, only rented it, would have been very upset if spent $20+ buying the movie.  Eye candy doesn't make a good movie or video game.  A good script does.  Had high hopes and was disappointed.",1233792000,7,4260,4.739427012278308
3643712,5,B001HQZJWK,"I love getting animated Blu-Ray movies since they always look so nice compared to the DVD version.

Anyway, this movie goes through the events that occured between RE4 and RE5. After watching this, I got pretty hyped up for RE5.

It brought back fun memories of RE2 since it's Claire and Leon working together. I was a bit disappointed there was no Japanese audio for this movie.

It's not related to the regular movies.  Those are American, while this movie is Japanese (production- not language!).

But with Resident Evil: Degeneration, Capcom and Sony must have heard the cries of fans and gave us this nice little treat just in time before Resident Evil 5. I'm not going to summarize the story, that will spoil the movie, but I will say this: The movie has the formula of why we love Resident Evil, something the live-action movies forgot about. This thriller is worth watching twice. You realize things after watching it twice and adds up better story wise.

In short: Resident Evil fan? Buy this movie. It's a step in how an RE movie should be done!",1232841600,,806,4.513698630136986
3643724,3,B001HQZJWK,"Resident Evil: Degeneration is the first fully-animated movie based on the Capcom horror/survival video game series. This has NO affilation whatsoever to the live-action trilogy starring sexpot Milla Jovovich(Alice doesn't live here!), and takes place in the same fictional universe as the video game storyline.

Happening supposedly about a year after RE4, we meet up with RE2 survivor Claire Redfield, who is working with an enviromental preservation originization, and ends up going to an airport which has been the target of a alleged terrorist attack who are using the T-Virus to make zombies, mainly to get stop a U.S. senator who is working on an act to clean up the damages left by the Umbrella Corp. After getting herself and a few others safely away from a zombie hoard, Claire is rescued by Leon Kennedy, fresh from his European vacation in RE4.

The movie then takes a different turn after the first half-hour. Where as the first third is a setup for the plot and a basic zombie ""shoot 'em up"" scenario, the rest of the story involves an overly-detailed plot about a company called WilPharma which is responsible for creating vaccines to the T-Virus for terrorist outbreaks around the world. Claire goes with the company rep Frederic Downing to their research plant, while Leon heads out with Angela, an SRT officer whose brother Curtis is responsible for the outbreak in the airport. What follows from here is a shutdown of the pharmacy facility, and Curtis making off with the G-Virus(which is like the T-Virus on steroids)that he uses on himself. Leon and Angela just make it out alive, while leaving the mutated Curtis behind to go down with the rest of the lab. Its revealed that Downing set the whole thing up as a sales pitch to promote their vaccine to terrorists who were using the T-Virus.

Alot of what's missing from this to make it a decent zombie flick is the actual lack of zombies in it. After the part at the beginning with the terminal of the living dead, the rest of it just falls very flat as a horror movie. There's also a random zombie bunch that show up in the research lab for about 10 seconds for almost no explained reason, other than the movie hadn't had any other zombies in it for a good 45 minutes or so. Where as the live-action movies derailed alot from the original video game premise, there was at least enough monsters and explosions to keep the average horror buff satisfied.

As an animated movie, this is fair. The CGI isn't as good as say FFVII: Advent Children(heck, even FF: The Spirits Within was better!), but just as good as most of the cutscenes in any of the games. If your looking for a truly gory animated movie based on a video game, you'd probably be better off with Dead Space: Downfall.",1232841600,2,2750,4.687370600414079

Can anyone help/tell me why Mila Jovovich is not in this ""film"", and does the story continue from Apocalypse ?  She was last seen talking to the Umbrella bosses who were underneath Tokyo ?

Basically, i thought the films 1-3 are excellent, as they tell the story , and the flashbacks that Alice has blend in perfectly with the plot.  I have no interest in gaming, and have never played any of the Resident Evil games, but treat the films independently as ""films in their own right"".

If this CGI #4 is not linked to apocalypse, does anyone connected with the makers/in the know, know if the plot from #3 will be carried on.

3643728,1,B001HQZJWK,"A truly terrible move, Resident Evil literally has no redeeming features whatsoever.

The point that kills the movie completely is the CGI; it's inexcusably bad. Characters' hair is apparently made of levitating wire, clothes are made of rigid plastic, arms are one foot too long, elbows are completely round, musculature never contracts, expressions and gesticulations are ridiculously wooden and just simply BIZZARRE at times and the eyes (especially on the females) look absolutely diseased. The voice actors get the job done but it would be nicer if the mouths synched up with the speech more often. I've never appreciated SquareEnix's abilities until I saw this mess.

The plot is regurgitated, non-scensical crap you've already seen in almost every other zombie movie out there; never mind that it's all been pulled from past Resident Evil games anyway. There is nothing new here; no surprises, nothing interesting. The film repeatedly attempts to make logic jumps that just don't make it. I really had to sit open mouthed during most of it just wondering what the heck they were trying to do.

Characters, as usual in an action flick, are offensive stereotypes that repeatedly make the dumbest decisions they can. Women are overemotional and need rescuing, men have no personalities whatsoever or are evil, mindless louts. The sign of the truly awful film: if it's a character without a name, it'll be dead in the next five minutes.

This pile of trash isn't even worth the time of a hardcore Resident Evil fan.",1232236800,5,1518,5.06
3643729,3,B001HQZJWK,"This is not a bad movie, but will definitely get flack for being neither a live action film, nor an anime, nor a videogame... and will undoubtedly suffer from 'the Uncanny Valley' problem (the Uncanny Valley is a theory relating to robots or CGI characters.. that the more human they're made to look, the more they call attention to the fact that they're artificial, which causes the viewer to not be able to empathize with them, like them, etc)

... made worse by the fact that the characters do have a certain degree of facial 'stiffness'.  It didn't detract terribly for this viewer, but if you're not expecting it, it is immediately noticeable.

I think it's important to note that this film was created by the artists who created the cutscenes for the Resident Evil videogames. It's a small group of artists who've been with the franchise all along. If you take that into account, you realize this movie is not meant to be a blockbuster, or shed light on some aspect of the series we haven't seen... in many ways, it's similar to Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children... it's meant for the fans of the games.

And that's what's preserved in this film.. the game.  The dialogue is madly cheezy at points, there are cover-ups within cover-ups, T-Virus monstrosities.. and though Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield re-unite to kick some zombie butt (and re-enact their first meeting from RE2), the story is really about Angela Miller, USMC, and her estranged brother Curtis, who loses his family in the Raccoon City tragedy... I thought the storyline did kick into high action in the last half hour.  I didn't know what to think during the beginning of the airport sequence, but once the story moved past that to the goings on at the WilPharma facility, I was hooked.

I'd also mention that the BluRay transfer is quite excellent, visually, there's plenty of 'pop' in this film.. though I was surprised that there was no Japanese audio.",1232064000,,1933,4.7522388059701495
3643730,4,B001HQZJWK,"Going into Resident Evil: Degeneration I wasn't sure what to expect, but I did have slightly low expectations; the first Resident Evil game was classic and I was never hooked on a game like I was with that. I would spend hours and hours playing that game, but never played the rest until Resident Evil 4. Well I played a couple of levels of Resident Evil 2. It's not that I didn't want to it's just something I never really got around to, but I really enjoyed the first and fourth game a lot. As for the film franchise, which this has no connection with Degeneration, I thought they were alright. All 3 movies are watchable, but very forgettable and on multiple viewings they tend to get worse.

If you've never played the games before you can still enjoy Resident Evil: Degeneration, while knowing the games would probably help you enjoy this a little more when all is said and done you really don't have to know the games to enjoy the movie. I've only really played two of the games, none in which had Claire, but Leon is in Resident Evil 4 so I don't really know Claire's character, but yet it didn't take away from the movie for me at all. But knowing the games again will probably help you enjoy this a little more, but it's not a must.

Even though Degeneration has no connection to the live action series I still went in with slightly low expectations and Resident Evil: Degeneration is far better than the live action series and overall far better than I thought it would be it still falls a little flat. The movie gets off to an amazing start with some good suspense and tension. The first act is set in an airport and the scenes were great. As I'm watching it the first thought I had was this is the best zombie movie to come along in ages (not counting the 28 Days/Weeks Later movies since by right they aren't zombies).

But after the opening act Resident Evil: Degeneration does start to decline a little bit, but always stays entertaining it just wasn't able to keep the high level of the first act. As stated before the opening act is very solid. It has a great build up and is filled with suspense and tension. But as we get more into the G-Virus it loses a little steam and the zombies pretty much go MIA for the remainder of the movie except a couple of scenes; while the plot is pretty good it does sort of feel like it drags in some spots.

Writer Shotaro Suga does a pretty good job for the most part; the characters are all solid and entertaining, but not all works. The opening act Senator Davis (Michael Sorich) plays a pretty big part and his character seemed like it would be crucial, but after the airport scenes he barley plays a part. I think there was some potential there, but nothing comes about. The script isn't perfect, but gets the job done and is far better than the three Resident Evil movies written by Paul WS Anderson.

Director Makoto Kamiya early on creates a lot of suspense and tension and the set up is excellent, but Degeneration as I stated before does run out of steam, but Kamiya is able to keep the movie fairly interesting despite the sometimes lack of action. Kamiya manages to get some the suspense and tension back for the final act, but it never reaches the level of the opening act. But overall he gets it done and crafts an enjoyable if not slightly lackluster of a movie.

Fans of the game are probably the best audience for Degeneration, but non-fans can still watch this and enjoy it; if you're disappointed in the live action series this while not great or anything if overall a lot more enjoyable and worth checking out.

The Blu-ray looks and sounds excellent and is jam packed with special features, which are pretty much the same as the DVD except a couple of minor features excusive to the Blu-ray.",1232064000,2,3765,4.424242424242424
3643731,2,B001HQZJWK,"I was very disappointed by this film. With the excellent storyline from the video games as the foundation, this film could have done so much.  So many story elements from the games for the writers to choose from to expand upon.  Origin/motivation of Wesker, Leon's government training after RE2, some backstory on the Redfields and on and on. A missed opportunity by Capcom.",1231804800,,374,4.920634920634921
3643732,3,B001HQZJWK,"Having just completed Resident Evil 4 once again I was all revved up for Degeneration hoping for a continuation of the story with Leon Kennedy. All the RE games have followed a set template consisting of a lone armed man or woman fighting a hoard of undead and genetically altered beasts leading to a final confrontation with a powerful, virus infected human. The reason Capcom sticks with this formula is because it works but Degeneration breaks the pattern to its detriment. Zombie's (or virus infected human's) are present but no modified creatures. No embiggoned spiders or snakes or freaky dogs or sharks, just zombies and the inevitable G-Virus monstrosity who takes nearly half the film to destroy.

I was pleased to see that Leon is voiced by the same actor who played him in RE4. Problem is Leon looks a little bit off. Let me step back for a moment and say that the United States is clearly ahead of Japan in terms of computer generated visuals. The big problem in Degeneration is that even the living characters look undead. It appears to me that what the animators did was model the faces add some blinking and mouth movement and call it a day. The problem is it creates a very odd plastic look as if all the characters were wearing masks. The face they modeled for Leon looks like Leon except in a permanent scowl and his eyes are obscured by the shadow of his brow so you can scarcely see them. Clair looks even worse with an unexplainably odd mouth rendering. The still shots look fine but her facial movements just aren't working and character motions often look mechanical.

I really wanted to like this one. Unlike the live action movies it's put out by Capcom so I assume that it will be integrated into the series canon and I would expect to see it referenced in future games. Too bad the plot is so flat and uninspiring that maybe it doesn't even matter. There are no interesting characters like Luis Sera, Krauser, Saddler, Salazar and Chief Mendez. In Degeneration we get the laughably evil Senator Ron Davis, Fredrick Downing, Curtis Miller and Leon's potential love interest, the forgettable Angela Miller.

My only complaint with RE 4 was that it wasn't scary. It was often creepy but never scary. Degeneration takes it even further by being neither scary nor creepy. That's not quite true; the mannequin like appearances of the characters is kinda creepy. Degeneration is pure action which seems to be the unfortunate direction that Capcom is taking the series. The extra features are actually pretty good and if you watch the preview for Resident Evil 5 there is a clear tie to Degeneration. This is a pretty exciting time for Resident Evil fans and I hope they continue to make these movies but this first effort is pretty disappointing with a lot of room for improvement.",1231804800,4,2801,4.7122448979591836

I think Claire could have done better, after all this is THE REUNION between Claire and Leon, the stars of resident evil 2 (video game). Leon looks a little different from re4, yes it does slow down after the airport but the G-virus is here too, along with a monster that is like the birkin monster from re2. Claire says she has a new boyfriend and Leon kisses any other girl but Claire, so i don't think we'll ever see them as couple in the future, too bad. It was good, they should make another one with CHRIS and Jill, now that would be cool. Resident evil fans from the first to the 4th game will enjoy it, the movie had some cool things it lacked some others but its WAY BETTER than the live action movies.",1231632000,,794,4.230263157894737

Degeneration is about 90 minutes long and packed with some great zombie fighting action. Leon, Claire and a military Special Response Team need to track down an anti-virus for the T-virus, and in some ideal video game settings like a zombie infested demolished airport and a destroyed multi-level high-rise, they set out to do so.

The entire movie is reminiscent of what you'd expect in the cutscenes in any current&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PlayStation-3/dp/B001COU9I6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PlayStation 3</a>&nbsp;video game.

This CGI film to me really grabbed my attention because it felt so familiar.  I watched many Western zombie films to a name a few Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, and 28 Weeks Later are the ones that come to my mind immediately.  The director even said so in the extra features interview video that he took some inspirations from well-known Western directors in the zombie genre in the making of RE: Degeneration.  This to me, made the movie easier to watch and enjoy because of its familiarity.  I didn't get the disconnect I felt like when I first watched the Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, but this movie was different that it allowed me to get into it without being distracted by other ""things"" and just enjoy the show.  So, if you are a fan of the zombie genre films (especially Western influenced) then this one should be added up to your collection.",1231286400,,987,4.455555555555556
3643737,3,B001HQZJWK,"I love Resident Evil and really enjoy the video games a lot even though I am not to much on the live action movies.  With that said I was surprised that I liked this movie even though I didn't love it.

The video quality is pretty awesome in the blu ray version with pretty thing I noticed wasawesome sound.  The one thing I noticed was the close up of faces are greatly detailed but from far away look like they have kind of a plastic coating or something that reminded me of Advent Children.  I enjoyed certain scenes of the usually overdone slow motion, like when Leon throws Claire a handgun in the airport or Leon shooting a mutant in the face in the facility are really great.  The animation is great but not really an as advanced as I hoped from when Advent Children.  I did notice more vibrant colors and the flame effects are very good with fantastic lighting and rich blacks.

I was hoping for more of an open movie instead of being in claustrophobic atmospheres and Leon has too much perfect hair.  Even at the end of the movie no one seemed roughed up to bad and their hair and faces remained intact unless you suffer from a case of zombiefacationism of course.  Like I said earlier this movie surprised me that I enjoyed it.  I wish it felt bigger and on a larger scale but the whole thing just felt small be it the amount of the immediate cast or the location.  The only open part being the airport at the beginning and thank goodness they didn't make the whole thing based in the airport.  The whole movie could have been a bunch of cut scenes from a video game like a new Resident Evil game and why so serious all the time Leon.  I think I enjoyed this better than the current Resident Evil trilogy and wonder why this isn't the route they took instead of live action.  The story doesn't feel like a movie but more part of a mini series which is why I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have by the end.

Fans of Resident Evil should watch since it is a nice inclusion and it didn't hurt the series or make it look bad.  The blu ray is fantastic to show off its capabilities since it just looks so pretty even if sometimes character movements aren't always fluid and an occasional plastic texture face.  Special features aren't the greatest but still nice to have and I guess they will have a special edition later.  Though it is three stars for me I still enjoyed it and its a 5 star just for its picture and audio quality but that's not enough to warrant a purchase.

3643740,5,B001HQZJWK,"I was excited when I first seen the preview for this movie, advertised on the Resident Evil Extinction film. My biggest hope was that the movie would be good because the more films they make, the worse they get. This film was refreshing, along with being completly CGI, they also bring back 2 Resident Evil alumni, Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, both from the Resident Evil 2 video game. The film develops its own story and plot, (with elements from previous games and films) and turns out to be suprisingly great. Without exposing to much of the story, the umbrella Corporation has went out of business, and renegade employees have released the G and T Viruses on the black market for sale. Now the viruses are being used for terrorist attacks, and ""Wil pharmaceuticals"" has developed a anti-virus to both strains, but many suspect foul play by the company. drama ensues, Claire and Leon have to stop another outbreak of the viruses. It was more like a thriller then a horror, the blood and gore is VERY limited almost nonexisting. There is also some hint of a love story as Leon seems to be torn between Claire and Angela. Overall, I enjoyed this film, I loved the flashbacks to game sequences from the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil-2/dp/B00000I1BJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil 2</a>&nbsp;video game sprinkled throughout. If you like Resident Evil this is a must have.

Now Im going to rag on the film, even thought I love it and gave it 5 stars. I felt that since this was a CGI film, they were going to have a lot of blood, guts, macabre and gore, but there wasnt, which really disappointed me (I love hardcore horror!!!). The constant dust ALL OVER THE PLACE was extremely aggrivating, in an attempt to make it look real they added that, but it does more harm than good. Also, at times the characters mouth movements don't match the audio track, its like watching a subtitled movie. And, I didn't like how they kind of threw the plot in your face and didn't give it time to develop, everything happens so fast, you gotta watch it twice to REALLY understand it.

3643742,3,B001HQZJWK,"The Resident Evil video game series has been around for about fifteen years. The series has spawned off several offshoots and entered other mediums, including novels, movies, and comic books. Two of the most popular characters in the series are the heroes of RESIDENT EVIL 2: Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield (sister of RESIDENT EVIL and the upcoming RESIDENT EVIL 5 game, Chris Redfield). Leon is perhaps the most popular of all the characters in the Resident Evil series (so much so that he was the hero of RESIDENT EVIL 4) but he and Claire are both back and are reunited in RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION, a computer-animated movie that ties together events from the previous Resident Evil games to the upcoming RESIDENT EVIL 5.

RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION takes place seven years after the horror and destruction of Raccoon City. It's also been about a year since the events of RESIDENT EVIL 4. The Umbrella Corporation, responsible for creating the deadly T-virus that brought about the destruction of Raccoon City, has fallen apart as a corporation and no longer exists. A new organization, WilPharma, has risen from the ashes of Umbrella's demise and many are fearful that the research of WilPharma will bring about another Raccoon City-type disaster. Claire Redfield has joined Terra-Save, an organization that is attempting to stop such research. While at the Harvardville airport meeting some friends who have arrived from India, a man infected by the T-virus begins attacking people and soon after a plane full of infected people crashes into the airport. Claire becomes trapped in the airport with a young Indian girl and a U.S. Senator who is a major stock-broker of WilPharma. Later a small rescue team led by special agent Leon S. Kennedy enters the airport to rescue the survivors before the airport is cleansed. After the harrowing escape, Claire tags along with Frederic Downing, a researcher at WilPharma responsible for creating a vaccine for the T-virus, to his office while Leon travels with Marine Angela Miller to hunt down Angela's brother Curtis, a known terrorist.

Hollywood has made three live-action Resident Evil movies so far, but other than the T-Virus and some cameos by characters from the games, the movies have not much resembled the games. RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION is a movie made specifically for those familiar with the video game series. It is the type of movie that should have been made originally. There are several little moments thrown out that seem entertaining in themselves, but mean more if you are familiar with the universe from the Resident Evil games. However, even if you've never played a Resident Evil game, RE: DEGENERATION is a movie that you can enjoy. The animation is amazing; there are times when the characters are completely lifelike. The plot if filled with action and has all kinds of twists and turns, some expected and a few completely unexpected, and the storyline is easy to follow. There is some cheesy dialogue here and there, but that happens in most action pictures.

I can see that there might be some who will not like this movie or might even blast it because it doesn't have anything to do with Alice, the character Milla Jovovich portrayed in the live-action Resident Evil movies. Those movies are basically tied to the real Resident Evil universe in name-only. Unless something drastic happens, Alice really doesn't exist in the real Resident Evil universe. So, if you're only familiar with the Resident Evil movie, just know ahead of time that this is a different world than the one Hollywood has promoted and give RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION a chance. It's an entertaining enough movie that you should probably enjoy it.

Highly recommended for fans of the Resident Evil games. People who aren't fans of the games will probably enjoy it, too.

In regards to the differences between Blu-ray and DVD, there really aren't any. Have seen the movie in both Blu-ray and DVD and I could tell no difference between the picture quality of the Blu-ray and DVD. In fact, there were moments that the Blu-ray version had a weird shimmer that was quite distracting. I've been told this is probably because of the pixel count the film was originally filmed in and what happened when it was upscaled to 1080p, but this is a problem I've seen before on other Blu-ray discs.

The extras include character profiles, the ""Generation of DEGENERATION"" making-of featurette, voice bloopers, a faux Leon interview that really makes no sense (I think this is a joke for the filmmakers), trailers for RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION, trailers for the upcoming RESIDENT EVIL 5, and trailers for other movies. The only ""Blu-ray only"" extras are a pop-up trivia track and an interactive picture-in-picture. There are some Comic-Con clips available as well, but you have to have Blu-ray profile 2.0 and be connected to the Internet.",1231200000,,4883,5.0073891625615765

3643746,4,B001HQZJWK,"""Resident Evil: Degeneration"" gives loyal fans of the popular survival horror franchise everything they've wanted from day one, a unique feature length film that holds true to the universe of characters and non-stop action established within the games.

The story reunites Claire Redfield and Leon Kennedy, last seen together in ""Resident Evil 2,"" who both barely survived the nuclear destruction of Raccoon City seven years prior. Here they face a mysterious renegade out to avenge his wife and daughter, who perished in that same tragedy; this on the heels of a vicious zombie plague that has completely overrun the bustling Harvardville Airport. The lethal G-Virus soon enters the fold through a new pharmacuetical company that is aiming to continue Umbrella's hideous legacy, while a new brand of Tyrant mutation subsequently plots to kick-start another widespread outbreak.

I really must say I had a fun time with this, far more so than I ever would have previously imagined. What seperates it from the three ""Resident Evil"" movies we already have is its execution. Director Makoto Kimiya's ingenius production is entirely computer generated, in very much the same vein as ""Beowulf"" and ""The Polar Express."" The animation here, in my judgment, is just as impressive. While the english dubbing may not be properly synched, I can still overlook it. Kamiya had, after all, initially steered this release towards a japanese audience. That certainly shouldn't matter to those who, like me, have consistently enjoyed each and every game to bear the ""Resident Evil"" banner. The action flows thick and the pacing is rapid fire.

This flick is closer to the games in style than the other movies.  And animation has reached a point that in ten years the figures may look absolutely real. As it is the details are fantastic with strands of hair blowing in the wind etc.  The movements of people are still a little less than fluid to what reality can offer;  but I can imagine seeing a animated cgi movie  in 2019 (or later) where everything looks as if they were real people and the moviements will be the same as reality.  The story is typical resident evil with a large research  complex that has zombies in it and a exciting airport zombie attack. One detracting point is perhaps  that the main monster, a almost indestructible thing with a big eye takes alot more to kill than the average resident evil creature.

The version of the story gives you stunning CG graphics that have so much detail at times, that it looks real. Especially the detail that was put into the guns. The story is equally as good because it is interesting, action packed, and incorporates characters from the past games. So if you have been following the game you will definitely recognize these characters. A good watch for children from the age 10 on up to adults. Highly recommended.",1231027200,,550,4.680412371134021
3643750,4,B001HQZJWK,"Just got finished watching this. I went into it not expecting much, but I'm glad to report I was pleasantly surprised. While it's not the greatest movie I've seen, it was defintely entertaining. The last couple of CG game movies I've seen I've been a little dissapointed. Advent Children was a jumbled mess, and The Spirits Within was a slight bore. Degeneration had a nice mix of action and nostalgia with a little thrill aspect thrown in.

As with the last few game CG movies, the directors seem to flub on the plot. I guess they forget they have 2 hours to tell a story instead of 15. The plot had some silly connections to the T-virus, and while not the confusing mess of Advent Children, it was a little sparse. It would have been nice if it had succeeded more in that area.

Claire and Leon don't really get much character development, but a couple of the new characters do. While it's not much, it suffices. For some reason, Leon is so incredibly cool, that he never shows much emotion. While it can make him a likeable character in some regards, he doesn't have much range and tends to come across more as dull instead of the calculated and cool character the devs want him to be. There were a couple of scenes where a tad more emotion would have been nice, but he stood dull and taciturn with a blank face. It's a little distracting, but by no means a deal breaker.

In some spots the models and characters look like they'd belong in a game. Then in others it looks almost photogenic. While not bad, it's slightly noticeable but it doesn't take you out of the immersion by any means.

There are also no villians as cool as Wesker. We get a hippie bio-terrorist upset over the death of his family by umbrella. You've prolly seen him a few times in the previews, he's the main villian. Along with a few twists, he's really lacking. The bright spot is oddly, the female characters. Claire seems fun and competent. The other female lead is given a little character development and is likeable as well. For some reason though, they tried a little too hard to make Leon ""cool"" and instead he comes across as dull. A little more fleshing out of Leon as a lead character would be nice along with a little emotion.

Overall though I was surprised that this movie didn't turn out to be a disaster like Advent Children. While it hasn't proved that CG will overtake live action anytime soon, it was a definte bonus to fans of the series. With RE5 right around the corner, RE fans have a lot to look forward to.",1231027200,2,2507,4.429501084598699

Leon Kennedy is called in to lead a rescue mission after receiving a call that a US Senator is alive but trapped inside. While rescuing the senator, a new company with a vaccine to Umbrella's T-Virus (WilPharma) comes to the rescue. However, not long after they arrive it is clear that someone wants to keep the virus and the vaccine to themselves and not everything is as it appears, as several of the story's characters begin to show their darker sides.

Great film. Great animation. Great Extras.

This is the Resident Evil movie that should have been the first Resident Evil (save Pail WXYZ Anderson) and had that been the case, there more than likely been a larger following. R.E.D. was very well done, with great acting, animation and is a must have for any fan of the series and especially the games -- it's the closest RE outing yet.

The extras were fun with character bios and some voice-over outtakes that were hilarious. I especially enjoyed the much-longer trailer for Resident Evil 5 -- which looks outstanding I might add.",1230940800,,1162,4.7711442786069655

Now if you are a hardcore fan that collects, I would buy it and never open it, then when a decade pass see how much it is worth on eBay. LOL!

3643754,5,B001HQZJWK,Since I'm a big RE fan when I heard this movie was coming out I just had to get it. I'm glad I did. I liked the storyline & the graphics were amazing!! They did a great job on this even though the director couldn't speak a word in English and the actors were Amercian. My only complaint I really didn't like how they portrayed Claire's character. I'm used to the video game character I suppose. This is just my opinion though. I thought the red and white umbrella part was a bit funny(A joke perhaps)(Remind you of anything?)The voice bloopers were so funny especially Claire's flame. I give this movie a 5 because even though I'm a little nitpicky on Claire it was still an enjoyable movie. It had characters we knew and introduced new characters also. All in all it did what it was supposed to do which was trying to keep it similar to the games but also tell us a completely different story. I was yelling at a part where Leon was telling them to shoot them in the head but they just wouldn't listen!!

I was looking forward to seeing Leon & Claire in a story that was more than just cut-scenes. That being said, when the best thing on the DVD is the scripted ""gag/blooper reel,"" something is really wrong.

I gave this one star simply because Amazon wouldn't let me give it no stars. The story is stupid, the characters are one-dimensional, and the CGI of some of the characters (the Senator, for one) is pathetic. Except for the bloopers, the bonus features are useless. The ""interview"" with Leon Kennedy was boring and insipid.

3643757,2,B001HQZJWK,"I was really quite unpleasantly surprised by this movie. I figured, a video game based direct to DVD 3D animated movie, Okay. So I set the benchmark around Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children, in terms of animation, style, and overall action, sat back, and prepared for some intense story, and zombie killing action.

What I got here was poorly written, animated, modeled, and directed mush that would barely pass as an in-game cutscene. The story was convoluted, the characters stiff and wooden (Leon's hair NEVER moves: In wind, water, explosions, NEVER!) and the whole long-winded affair offered only about 20 minutes of true action.

I have enjoyed the RE franchise since it's beginning, and consider myself a true fan. That said, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, save the collector who simply must have this small piece of the story told. It was truly appalling what this studio thought would pass for entertainment in the eye's of it's fans.

3643761,4,B001HQZJWK,"Resident Evil, for all of its gripes about controls (which never bothered me) to its illogical puzzles (which do), has always been my favorite of the survival horror series. Instead of psychological terror, Resident Evil is all about that sense of surprise and shock when the quiet suddenly gets a blast of action when you least expect it. But there is one criticism that you can level at Resident Evil and even other Capcom games such as Devil May Cry is in its writing in that for all the fun to be had playing the game, hearing the voice acting is always awkwardly delivered which doesn't help with its B-movie dialogue. So to prepare fans for the highly-anticipated release of ""Resident Evil 5"", we have a movie that shares the same trends as the games: looks nice, characters are cool but it's laughable for the wrong reasons. Still fun though...just no controller.

It's been roughly 10 years since ""Resident Evil 2"" when Leon Kennedy, rookie cop for the Raccoon City police force escaped the viral outbreak that overran the city along with Claire Redfield, a woman searching for her brother. With both having been in their own adventures since (4 and Code Veronica respectively), the 2 unexpectedly reunite when Claire, returning from a trip, is trapped within an airport as an outbreak of the virus transforms the people into flesh-munching zombies and a plane crashes into the terminal. Leon is sent in to rescue her along with senator Ron Davis who has ties to WilPharma, a pharmaceutical company Claire' campaigning against. Together, along with soldier Angela Miller, unravel the mystery concerning the viral outbreak and who's running the show.

The live-action films, which were panned and dismissed quite easily (though I'm probably one of the few that actually finds some entertainment in them) were criticized for not really feeling like the games, turning a tense horror atmosphere to a shoot-em-up over metal music so in comes Capcom with their own film as if to say ""this is how they should be done"" and strangely, the horror part of it is actually missing. It's got poor lighting yes, but it's not really creepy or fill you with that sense of dread like walking through the Spencer mansion knowing something was going to blast out of the doors...especially those Crimson Heads. Bastards. This film on the other hand is more like the fourth entry, well numbered that is, in that it's more about being outnumbered and hoping you'll make it so the film is more bullet-heavy and while I did find it entertaining, it didn't really have a tension to it.

That being said, it's fun seeing Leon and Claire back and being able to see the universe of the games again is always a pleasure. Hell, even Hunnigan, Leon's cute and spectacled support from 4 shows up and that was quite nice. However for fans of the series it might not have all you're looking for since outside from Leon and Claire, Hunnigan, an eerily photorealistic render of William Birkin from RE2 in the trivia track, no one from the old gang shows up. A passing remark about Claire's brother pops up but for some, there's no mention of Jill, Sherry and one character introduced in the film and a development that happens might make one wonder: um, but what about Ada?

As far as the animation is concerned, it works though it unimpresses. While locales are nicely rendered and the ""boss"" so to speak is well done, the characters themselves look slightly off with strange facial designs, off vocal lip-sync and weird movements. But then again, as gorgeous as the REmake and Zero were on the Gamecube, they too had beautiful environments but robotic character animations so can't complain too much. Voice acting is...all over the place too and while it's great to see Paul Mercier replay Leon and Alyson Court do Claire, the dialogue they're given just feels bad at times and more time and writing could've benefited the characters but when even a remade sandwich line turns into ""any longer and you would've fit nicely into a sandwich"" still shows up after complaints and lengthy improvement periods, maybe it's just Capcom.

For most Resident Evil fans, watching Degeneration is kind of a given but again like with Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, they'll be people who love it and people who think ""ugh"". Best thing really to do is give the film a shot and test the waters. Otherwise you'll be waiting till March to get your zombie fix.",1230681600,,4418,4.800262812089356
3643762,3,B001HQZJWK,"If you've seen a lot of pure CG anime movies, you know what to expect: Impossibly styled hair, bad lip sync, and lots and lots of dialogue about a character's tortured past. It's not terrible, but it's not terrific. It would be a serviceable cinematic for a RE 4 1/2 game.

The movie itself takes place between RE4 and RE5. Leon has returned from Spain and reunited with his RE2 companion, Claire Redfield (who looks similar to her Code Veronica cinematics). There also a cameo by the pharmaceutical company featured in RE5. There's lots to like for RE fans.  But there's also a ton to pick apart by movie lovers. There's the overwrought dialog that kills the pacing. Do I really need to hear about your terrible history in the middle of a zombie showdown? Much like Advent Children, the characters inexplicably have dry hair after swimming, never get dirty or break a sweat, and their clothes never get wrinkled (even after two bombings, a plane crash, a fireball, a crumbling building and a giant monster -- and oh yeah, zombies!)

On the plus side, the movie uses American mocap artists and not the overacting silliness of Japanese mocap.

The bonus features on the blu-ray are pretty light. There's a trailer for RE5 (which looks 1000% better than this movie). There are some pointless pop-up trivia tracks that any RE fan will already know. And there's some picture-in-picture extras that show mocap sessions, concept art and storyboards. It's not terribly interesting as it's 90% the same as every other CG movie -- lots of people running around in spandex and golf balls.

3643767,4,B001HQZJWK,"The Resident Evil series has become one of the top selling titles for video game company CAPCOM.  Known in Japan as ""Biohazard"", the series has sold over 34 million games and among the series, one of the most popular titles was the 1996 Sony Playstation game ""Resident Evil 2"" which introduced us to the characters of  Raccoon City rookie police officer Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield (sister of ""Resident Evil 1"" hero Chris Redfield).

The two were popular characters that fans enjoyed and in 2005, ""Resident Evil 4"" featuring Leon Kennedy became a huge hit earning ""Game of the Year"" by various publications.

With the popularity of the character of Leon Kennedy, how fitting was it when CAPCOM announced the reuniting of both Leon and Claire.  As a fan of the video game series, I was definitely excited and couldn't wait to see the film.

""resident evil: DEGENERATION"" takes place seven years after ""Resident Evil 2'.  The film starts off with a man on a flight to Harvardville and he happens to be infected with the T-virus (this virus turns a human to a zombie and can spread the virus by biting on a human/animal.  The only way they can be killed is a bullet to the brain), meanwhile at Harvardville Airport, we see Claire Redfield.

Claire now works for Terrasave, a search and rescue organization at chemical and biological attacks and meeting up with a friend and her niece.  Of course, all hell breaks lose in the airport after someone infected with the T-virus starts chomping on people and next thing you know, the airport becomes full of zombies. Next thing you know, the plane carrying the infected person with the T-virus crashes into the airport and zombies start coming out of the damaged plane.

Claire, Rani, a woman and Senator Ron Davis have barricaded in the airport but need help quickly.  Because the Senator is involved, the government sends in Leon Kennedy, who has experience taking on the zombies plus the help with two individuals from the Special Response Team.  The search and rescue begins.

After the first arc of the film featuring the search and rescue, the focus then goes to WilPharma, an agency that is creating an vaccine for the T-virus but it appears the terrorist have blown up the WilPharma trucks carrying the antidotes.  It is revealed that the terrorists are pretty much individuals who are trying to get people to recognize what happened at Raccoon City (since the government pretty much has covered up the zombie infestation due to the Umbrella Corp. and the T-virus).

Claire recalls seeing one of the terrorist at the airport, a man named Curtis Miller.  And then you find out that Angela Miller, one of the members of the Special Response Team that accompanied Leon is the sister of Curtis.

Because of the damaged trucks with the vaccine, WilPharma director Frederic Downing needs to go back to HQ and retrieve the vaccine.  Meanwhile, both Leon and Angela go to the home of Curtis to find him but find his home burned down.

You realize that Curtis is a terrorist because his family in Raccoon City was killed and he can not let the government continue to hide what happened to the city and thus, to prove to people of what happened, infects himself with the G-virus (which was featured in video game ""Resident Evil 3', a monster that is nothing like a zombie but a hideous and very powerful).

Thus the second arc of the film features Leon, Angela and Claire trying to stop the monster.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Picture quality is pretty good.  The film is entirely in CG and was created in Maya.  The CG was well done but not as fluid as ""Final Fantasy: Advent Children"" but still looked very impressive.  The rendered character models were just great to look at (especially at the beginning when you see the airport or even the WilPharma HQ.  Both look very realistic!) and Leon, Claire and Angela Miller model renders were just very well done.  If anything, there is slight jerkiness when it comes to a close up of a character and trying to make it do natural and realistic movements during a conversation.  But during the action scenes, the movements were very nice and overall, the CG was very well done.

On Blu-ray, you can see the skin bumps a bit more clearly and the action scenes look great.  If anything, fans of the video games will more than likely enjoy these CG rendered scenes.

As for audio, the audio, you get English Dolby TrueHD 5.1, French Spanish, Portuges and Thai in 5.1  The audio sounds awesome in TrueHD and the action scenes come alive when compared to the DVD version with its 5.1 track. Dialogue is quite clear.  As for the music, the ending theme ""Guilty"" is by Japanese music artist ANNA TSUCHIYA.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

For the Blu-ray version, you get to access an interactive picture-in-picture (I-PiP) which allows three PiP streams at any point during the movie.  For example, you can click the corresponding color that is lit up on screen via your remote.  Red would feature the actors in their motion capture suits and you can compare the motion capture to what you see in that exact scene.  The other is a stream that features a non-rendered 3D footage and the other stream is the storyboards featuring hand drawn images of certain scenes from the film.

Another feature is a pop-up trivia track.  Really interesting facts about the film and how certain characters were rendered.  Why certain characters were created a certain way and much more.  Also, the Blu-ray is BD LIVE ENABLED.

The Blu-ray disc features quite a few special features which include:

  * The Generation of DEGENERATION featurette - This featurette interviews Makoto Kamiya and other CAPCOM staff and their goal with the film, why they used the actual English voice actors in terms of the motion capture (including having them learn how to hold a gun) and more behind-the-scenes footage on the creation of the film.  Also, fan reaction at San Diego Comic Con.
  * Character Profiles - Profiles feature a text blurb on each character and you can access a video or photography profile (from parts of the film).
  * Voice Bloopers - This is more or less bloopers but not sure if it was intentionally created or if it was actual bloopers.  One featured Leon Kennedy telling the others about his ""fee"".  Quite funny to watch.
  * Faux Leon Interview - I'm not quite sure what this feature was about.  A man is interviewing one of the motion capture actors and the actor is talking about working with Kamiya-san and others on the film.
  * Resident Evil: Degeneration Trailers - Trailers for the film
  * Resident Evil: Degeneration Tokyo Game Show Trailer - Tokyo Game Show trailer
  * Resident Evil 5 Special Game Footage - Promotional video for the upcoming Playstation ""Resident Evil"" game.
  * Resident Evil 5 Game Trailers - Trailers for the upcoming Playstation 3 video game.

Let me first say that I am a big fan of the ""Resident Evil"" series and I own nearly all the US releases.  ""Resident Evil 2' really was innovative when it first was released for the Sony Playstation and was my favorite R.E. game until ""Resident Evil 4' was released and that video game was just incredible.

So, that being said, watching this film had me smiling because I absolutely adore both the characters of Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield.  How this film furthers the storyline of the two characters but also builds on certain situations that may have major ramifications for future video game releases is quite exciting.

So, with that being said, I enjoyed the film because the creators really wanted to pay homage to ""Resident Evil 2' and ""Resident Evil 4' video game series and its fans.  But I realize that many people who are not familiar with the video game series are wondering how the context of this film is to the live-action film series featuring Mila Jovovich.

There is a relation by name and of course, the virus that turns people to zombies but really, this film was created for the fans of the video game series in mind.

Also, with this being a video game-related film, many who crave a deep storyline with character development of who is Claire and who is Leon may feel disappointed.  The reason why video gamers who played the video games is that through those video game moments of playing these characters for hours, there was a vested interest.

I would assume that many viewers not familiar with the video game series won't pick up the importance of Claire or Leon to the actual ""Resident Evil"" storyline.  In fact, some may wonder why they should care about these characters especially at the end with the politics surrounding the viruses.

So, with that being said, ""resident evil: DEGENERATION"" is an awesome film for those who followed the video game series.  The film features plenty of non-stop action, bloody violence courtesy to the zombies and you even get a scene with blood that splatters on to the camera.  But the enjoyment comes from those who had the experience of playing ""Resident Evil 2"" and ""Resident Evil 4"" and to see Claire and Leon again.

The CG looks great and there are some moments that I was just really in awe but at the same time, there are some movements that were jerky and robotic at times.  But overall, the model renders were good and Leon and Claire look very good.  So, the bottom line is that this film is just total fan service for ""Resident Evil"" video game fans.  So much that I highly recommend this Blu-ray disc.

For those who are not familiar with the video game series, you may enjoy it but if you are expecting a continuation of the live action films, then this Blu-ray disc may not be for you.  In fact, some may be disappointed because there is no strong plot for them to truly enjoy these characters especially without playing the video games.  So, I can understand if they don't get into it.

Again, if you are fans of the ""Resident Evil"" video games, you can't help but have a smile on your face because there is now a ""Resident Evil"" film that was created with the RE video game fan in mind.  And for that, I recommend this Blu-ray disc for you!",1230595200,5,10065,4.678998292544109
3643768,4,B001HQZJWK,"I think like many Resident Evil game fans, I was friggin ecstatic when I found out about this movie. Truly this was something that was long overdue to the primary RE fan base, i.e. the gamers, and I think it was worth the wait for them to get it right.

The movie brings back some classic characters that gamers know and love, Leon Kennedy (RE2&4) and Clair Redfield (RE2) as they scramble to survive another T virus situation full of zombies and freaky virus creatures. The movie is completely in CGI (a good choice) and stays as true to the game's lore as it can get. The whole time I was watching the movie, I felt like it was a game that I had very little control of, from the beginning airport scenes to the very end. It was a great experience. The CGI, while a bit choppy in some areas, was very well done. The zombies were better done here then in the live action movies!

RE fans and movie buffs alike will be pleased with the finished product of this movie. The animation is great, the story is well done, and the voice acting is dead on. I expect they used the same guy for Leon that voiced him in RE4, which was a wise choice.

This is a must have for the hardcore RE fans, and anyone who likes a good action/thriller movie. The story is pretty good, and I read a rumor somewhere that this is supposed to be something of a prelude to the much anticipated RE5 coming out in 09. If you are hoping for some kind of an extension to the live action movies here, you will be very disappointed, but I encourage you to check it out anyway, its a good movie overall.",1230422400,,1568,4.20265780730897

Come on, chasing zombies in the desert? It looked more like a Mad Max movie than a RE movie. Degeneration blows all 3 away!!! Everyone needs to buy it so they will see there is enough interest for a sequel.

There REALLY needs to be a degeneration game for the PS3/360. I think the graphics and atmosphere look WAY better than RE5. So far the trailer for RE5 looks more like a mercenaries game than an RE game. Lets write CAPCOM and ask them to make a game from this movie as a side plot game.

3643771,5,B001HQZJWK,"Resident Evil Degeneration is a movie that is finally based on the video game. Since Capcom helped make the movie, expect alot of the classic Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield!

Whats The Movie About: Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield (survivors of the Raccoon City Incident) world turns around when are reunited to stop a company that is supposedly creating antidotes to the T-virus but secretly has The G-virus and selling it to the black market. What makes this movie similar to the game (Resident Evil 2), is their is a monster that the main characters will have to fight at the end.

Setting: 7 years after Raccoon City, Midwest, after Resident Evil 4. Think of the Movie as Resident Evil 4.5.

Graphics: CG, Outstanding graphics! Clear and makes you want to jaw to drop.

Acting: Really Good, Alyssa Court (plays Claire Redfield) was in the original RE 2,Code Veronica and Veronica X. Paul (plays Leon Kennedy) was also in RE 2 AND RE4. Laura Bailey (Full Metal Alchemist, Full Metal Panic!, Gunslinger Girl)is a professional voice actor. Since the actors are well known, the acting of the movie is not a problem expect for sometimes, they would show a person talking but it won't show their whole face.

Plot: The plot kicks in immediately when the movie starts. The plot doesn't die down. It keeps on bringing suspense to give that horror feeling.

Sound: Excellent! The sounds of gun firing, zombies moans, the explosions, makes you feel that you are in the movie. Very well thoughtout.

Con: The only con about the movie is that Leon is quite stiff. What i mean is when you see him in the beginning, He really doesn't move his body when he talks. At the end, Leon is not stiff as much.

Special Features: The special features offers how the movie was made, Bloopers, Trailers of RE D, Trailers of RE 5, Profile of each character in the movie, Previews of other movies.

If you are a Resident Evil Fan, you will not be disappointed! Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield are back! Their is new plot, and new characters. The replay value is very high and you will thank the creators of the movie on how the DVD is finally based on the Game.

Overall, An Outstanding CG (Computer Graphic) Movie.",1230422400,,2195,4.648578811369509
3643772,4,B001HQZJWK,"Don't get it twisted, you won't find Milla Jovovich anywhere in RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION as this full-on CG animation, canon-wise, is definitely more in sync with the video game series than the live-action film franchise. If you dig the visual graphics in animated films like FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN, FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN, POLAR EXPRESS and BEOWULF, then this one's up your alley, brother. In continuity, the events in RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION take place in between the two games, Resident Evil 4 and the upcoming Resident Evil 5 (March '09).

The story keeps it simple, basically planting its characters in treacherous environments and then throwing undead creatures at them. Seven years had elapsed since the Raccoon City outbreak (as fleshed out in the Resident Evil 2 video game). The Umbrella Corporation may have been shut down, but the T-virus is still making its rounds in the black market. The story starts with Claire Redfield (a survivor of doomed Raccoon City and a recurring lead character in the game) becoming trapped in a wrecked airport terminal during a zombie infestation, while she minds a little girl and a scuzzy senator.

A rescue team is deployed, comprising two members of the Special Response Team unit and ramrodded by government special agent Leon S. Kennedy (another fan favorite, also survived Raccoon City). The first half hour deals with how the rescue mission falls out, and if zombie kills get your jollies going, then this'll do ya. Once the survivors make it out of the airport, there's a bit of a lull, and then the next big act is introduced as the key characters make their way to yet another creepy multi-level research facility, this one run by an entity called the WilPharma Corporation. There, the survivors not only have to deal with a saboteur who intends to out the truth about the Raccoon City cover-up, but also with a frightening Gene-virus mutate who'll never lose a staring contest and who could absolutely palm a basketball (or ten basketballs).

So, fans of the best survival horror video games ever will get more out of this flick, whereas newcomers or those who've only peeped the Milla Jovovich trilogy will probably like it but, then again, may end up lost in places and may even wonder what the big deal is. The story is pretty generic; the voice acting is wooden; the dialogue is dang cheesy (Check out this dude, just before he turns into a Biohazard freakfest: ""In a moment, I'll reveal the irrefutable truth... in my own... personal way. And all of you will be the very first... witnesses!!""). Yet I found all that forgiveable. I'm just glad there's a movie out that actually honors the internal continuity of the games. And the film looks very good. The animators make good use of motion capture technology, and the awesome visual graphics end up being slicker than my buddy Vito's pompadour. I wish, though, that the characters' faces had been even more expressive.

Okay, feel free to ignore this paragraph, which I call Things-In-The-Movie-Which-Aggravated-The-Crap-Out-Of-Me. It's just me nitpicking. But, man alive, cry me a river with the horror movie cliches! To start with, there's always one yahoo who's always late getting with the program. The two S.R.T. members who went with Agent Kennedy had been briefed regarding the infecteds' tendencies, yet one of them, full of good wholesome samaritanship but also what can only be some sort of stupid DNA, abandons all caution and approaches a prone body point blank and, without even checking out the person, wraps an arm around him to help him up. I realize that this S.R.T. grunt had never faced anything like this before, but, still, it is so damn aggravating. Come to think of it, you'd think special agent Leon would've shown up on scene already with his own specially trained crew, instead of having to pick out two unknowns. Earlier on, Claire Redfield had become separated from the young girl she was with, as mass panic erupted at the terminal (zombies and a plane coming fast at your grill will do that). And yet the next scene with Claire finds her already reunited with the little girl. Obviously, they must've reconnected earlier offscreen, but the effect was still a bit jarring, as if a scene had been cut out. And one more, off the top of my head: later, when Claire and the little girl find themselves isolated and cornered by zombies, who by the way are slow as molasses, instead of summarily getting the eff outta there, Claire opts to crouch down and protectively hug the little girl. In the scheme of things, these minor quibbles can't change the fact that I enjoyed the film tremendously. Yet they did kill a bit of the fun for me.

On a happier note, while there's not much humor in the movie, there is one pretty cool, ironic moment which drew an appreciative grin out of me. It's the one at the airport in which Claire finally finds a weapon with which to combat zombies. ""Never saw this coming,"" she mutters.

The film ends with an ominous scene which suggests that history is doomed to repeat itself - yet one more time. It also supposedly leads into the Resident Evil 5 video game, so that's pretty sweet. Going by RE: DEGENERATION, I absolutely will shell out for more Resident Evil animated features which follow game continuity. And I wouldn't mind at all if the next one featured Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield. Or, hell, bring Alice into this universe. How's that for shaking things up, huh?",1230336000,3,5475,4.8315565031982945
3643773,4,B001HQZJWK,"It has almost been a little more than 10 years since the first ""Resident Evil"" (aka. Biohazard, Japan title) video game hit store shelves and introduced and defined ""survival horror"". The game series became a phenomenon in the video game industry. Hollywood made attempts in bringing the franchise to life with its ""Resident Evil trilogy"" into somewhat mixed reactions from the public. Now, Japanese animators with director Makoto Kamiya at the helm, re-introduces the saga in the form of a computer-generated motion picture, ""Resident Evil Degeneration"" (aka. Biohazard Degeneration) and captures the essence of the Capcom video games.

A Zombie attack brings chaos to Harvardville Airport. Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield (voiced by Paul Mercier and Alyson Court respectively), who fought the sinister Umbrella corporation during the Raccoon city tragedy 7 years ago are back. They're ready to combat the designs of a rogue extremist leader named Curtis Miller who is seeking for revenge after his family was killed in the Raccoon city incident. The deadly G-virus is unleashed and a new mutated ""Tyrant"" monster goes on the rampage. Will Claire and Leon be able to avert the spread of the much deadlier virus before history repeats itself.

While the knowledge of the plotline of the first 5 Resident Evil may indeed aid in the film's appreciation, it isn't really essential to its enjoyment. The film captures the elements of corrupt authority figures, government cover-ups, corporate espionage due to the draws of power and greed. The big ""Umbrella Corporation"" is no longer a big player in this installment (or are they?) and a new player in the corporate game ""WilPharma"" is at the center of all the mayhem. Lust for power and riches on the part of Senator Davis (Michael Sorich) and Frederick Downing (Crispin Freeman)is the main motivation. Classic characters Claire Redfield is just in the middle of it all, and Leon Kennedy is his usual ""take care of business type"" of agent.

The film is action-packed. The rescue mission at the airport in the film's first act is somewhat short but it was quite intense and captures the feel of the games. The plot then slows down a little as it slowly unravels the secrets of the WilPharma Corp., fleshes out its main supporting character, Angela Miller (voiced by Laura Bailey). The film does have its share of emotions but it felt a little too predictable, although I do believe it managed to do the best it could given its source material. There is also quite a number of violent scenes (it is R-rated), the CGI blood and gore plays a minor part in the film's enjoyment.

The zombies are the usual ""shambling"" slow-moving undead and the camera work executes the scenes fairly well. The gun battle and the encounters with the zombies prove very beneficial although the main draw will have to be our heroic duo's encounter with the new ""Tyrant"" creature. As with the games, it takes quite a number of attempts to stop the near-invincible monster, although truth be told, it wasn't a question of ""If"" but a question of ""when"". I suppose it may the film's weakness, as much as it is its biggest strength; ""Degeneration.."" definitely is a ""cardboard cut-out"" of the video games--so therefore, ""Resident Evil"" aficionados may not feel the slightest sensation of an unexpected outcome. I was hoping for more of an investigative puzzle-solving experience than your usual explosions and hyper-accelerated action sequences. I hope no one takes these comments as negative ones, because the film is entertaining and fun to watch, despite the simple plot--it feels like a ""tribute"" film to the highly-successful Japanese franchise.

The animation itself is amazing. The motion-capture animation is definitely an improvement over ""Final Fantasy Spirits Within"" and stomps on the animation in ""Beowulf""--but it is a little less fluid than ""Final Fantasy Advent Children"", (the animation doesn`t allow wardrobe to move and mimic the characters` movements). The facial features are full of expression; pain, disgust, anger and maybe even love are so carefully animated into the characters' eyes and actions. The action scenes are animated quite well, although, some scenes may need more polishing up than others. The Tyrant monster appearance is reminiscent of the monster in the franchise with some very ""feral"" improvements. Light reflections and the use of shadows are perfectly blended into the sequences and the CGI generated environment is nothing to sneeze at.

I am rather satisfied with ""Resident Evil: Degeneration"". The film is definitely a must for fans of the video game and is definitely up there with the best from Pixar studios. I was a little disappointed with the film's plot as it offered nothing new, but the film never loses its energy and keeps on its pace with a lot of momentum. While it feels to be tailored-made for international audiences, (those familiar with Japanimation know very well that they are mostly philosophical and deep) it isn't exactly a bad thing either. The action, gorgeous animation will definitely entertain, although its emotional ramifications wasn't essentially fleshed out. The film is a welcome treat to fans of the franchise.

Highly Recommended! [4 Stars]

Video/Audio: 1.78 ratio anamorphic widescreen. Clean and near-excellent transfer, some enhancements were noticed but it wasn't really that bad. The picture is amazing on the Dvd when up-converted to 1080p. The 5.1 Dolby Digital English track is clear but unfortunately, there is no Japanese language track. I think this was a huge mistake since I saw the original Japanese release and the dialogue was better suited and emotional than the English track. I wonder why they included French, Thai, Portuguese and Spanish tracks but they skipped the original language? There is no DTS-ES sadly.

3643776,3,B001HQZJWK,"So far, Hollywood has been making the majority of Resident Evil films and for the most part, though tolerable, aren't all that great.

This film isn't a masterpiece the way i would of liked it to be, but i wasn't expecting that. If anything i expected things to stay truer to the story and events in the games. And i believe it does that. And thats a big plus.

Now as a movie, its not bad. The computer graphics they use in this film are pretty good, but ive seen better in films like Beowulf (though i noticed someone said the visuals in this are better than that film, but thats a just not the case)
This film looks like we are watching an Xbox 360 game in a lot of ways. But it is still good looking. For a film that didn't go to theaters, its pretty good. Its on the level of Final Fantasy: Advent Children.

The acting is decent. And the events that take place are interesting and keep you watching. And the ""boss"", as it were, at the end, is awesome to watch, pretty worthy of a Resident Evil boss.

I like the setting this movie is in, taking place within an airport, and i could see them using this story for an RE game maybe in the past, but i guess they might of saved these side plots or left over ideas that didn't make it into the games and placed them in here for the movie, perhaps. who knows?

I liked seeing Clair and Leon together as partners again. Brings ya back to the RE 2 days. So i think this movie will be a decent Resident Evil fan pleaser, for the people who love the games and who follow the series.
I, for one, beat Resident 2 and owned Resident Evil 4 (which was GREAT) and cant wait to play RE 5, so i really appreciate Capcom actually going out there and giving us a new film to watch.",1229817600,,1718,4.101190476190476

3643778,4,B001HQZJWK,"The Resident Evil series has become one of the top selling titles for video game company CAPCOM.  Known in Japan as ""Biohazard"", the series has sold over 34 million games and among the series, one of the most popular titles was the 1996 Sony Playstation game ""Resident Evil 2' which introduced us to the characters of  Racoon City rookie police officer Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield (sister of ""Resident Evil 1' hero Chris Redfield).

The two were popular characters that fans enjoyed and in 2005, ""Resident Evil 4' featuring Leon Kennedy became a huge hit earning ""Game of the Year"" by various publications.

With the popularity of the character of Leon Kennedy, how fitting was it when CAPCOM announced the reuniting of both Leon and Claire.  As a fan of the video game series, I was definitely excited and couldn't wait to see the film. ""resident evil: DEGENERATION"" takes place seven years after ""Resident Evil 2'.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Picture quality is pretty good.  The film is entirely in CG and was created in Maya.  The CG was well done but not as fluid as ""Final Fantasy: Advent Children"" but still looked very impressive.  The rendered character models were just great to look at (especially at the beginning when you see the airport or even the WilPharm HQ.  Both look very realistic!) and Leon, Claire and Angela Miller model renders were just very well done.  If anything, there is slight jerkiness when it comes to a close up of a character and trying to make it do natural and realistic movements during a conversation.  But during the action scenes, the movements were very nice and overall, the CG was very well done.

If anything, fans of the video games will more than likely enjoy these CG rendered scenes.

As for audio, the audio is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 and during the action scenes (which there are many), sound does come alive and sounds very good on my system.  Dialogue is quite clear.  As for the music, the ending theme ""Guilty"" is by Japanese music artist ANNA TSUCHIYA.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The DVD features quite a few special features which include:

  * The Generation of DEGENERATION featurette - This featurette interviews Makoto Kamiya and other CAPCOM staff and their goal with the film, why they used the actual English voice actors in terms of the motion capture (including having them learn how to hold a gun) and more behind-the-scenes footage on the creation of the film.  Also, fan reaction at San Diego Comic Con.
  * Character Profiles - Profiles feature a text blurb on each character and you can access a video or photography profile (from parts of the film).
  * Voice Bloopers - This is more or less bloopers but not sure if it was intentionally created or if it was actual bloopers.  One featured Leon Kennedy telling the others about his ""fee"".  Quite funny to watch.
  * Faux Leon Interview - I'm not quite sure what this feature was about.  A man is interviewing one of the motion capture actors and the actor is talking about working with Kamiya-san and others on the film.
  * Resident Evil: Degeneration Trailers - Trailers for the film
  * Resident Evil: Degeneration Tokyo Game Show Trailer - Tokyo Game Show trailer
  * Resident Evil 5 Special Game Footage - Promotional video for the upcoming Playstation ""Resident Evil"" game.
  * Resident Evil 5 Game Trailers - Trailers for the upcoming Playstation 3 video game.

Let me first say that I am a big fan of the ""Resident Evil"" series and I own nearly all the US releases.  ""Resident Evil 2' really was innovative when it first was released for the Sony Playstation and was my favorite R.E. game until ""Resident Evil 4' was released and that video game was just incredible.

So, that being said, watching this film had me smiling because I absolutely adore both the characters of Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield.  How this film furthers the storyline of the two characters but also builds on certain situations that may have major ramifications for future video game releases is quite exciting.

So, with that being said, I enjoyed the film because the creators really wanted to pay homage to ""Resident Evil 2' and ""Resident Evil 4' video game series and its fans.  But I realize that many people who are not familiar with the video game series are wondering how the context of this film is to the live-action film series featuring Mila Jovovich.

There is a relation by name and of course, the virus that turns people to zombies but really, this film was created for the fans of the video game series in mind.

Also, with this being a video game-related film, many who crave a deep storyline with character development of who is Claire and who is Leon may feel disappointed.  The reason why video gamers who played the video games is that through those video game moments of playing these characters for hours, there was a vested interest.

I would assume that many viewers not familiar with the video game series won't pick up the importance of Claire or Leon to the actual ""Resident Evil"" storyline.  In fact, some may wonder why they should care about these characters especially at the end with the politics surrounding the viruses.

So, with that being said, ""resident evil: DEGENERATION"" is an awesome film for those who followed the video game series.  The film features plenty of non-stop action, bloody violence courtesy to the zombies and you even get a scene with blood that splatters on to the camera.  But the enjoyment comes from those who had the experience of playing ""Resident Evil 2' and ""Resident Evil 4' and to see Claire and Leon again.

The CG looks great and there are some moments that I was just really in awe but at the same time, there are some movements that were jerky and robotic at times.  But overall, the model renders were good and Leon and Claire look very good.  So, the bottom line is that this film is just total fan service for ""Resident Evil"" video game fans.  So much that I highly recommend this DVD.

For those who are not familiar with the video game series, you may enjoy it but if you are expecting a continuation of the live action films, then this DVD may not be for you.  In fact, some may be disappointed because there is no strong plot for them to truly enjoy these characters especially without playing the video games.  So, I can understand if they don't get into it.

Again, if you are fans of the ""Resident Evil"" video games, you can't help but have a smile on your face because there is now a ""Resident Evil"" film that was created with the RE video game fan in mind.  And for that, I recommend this DVD for you!",1229126400,60,6586,4.648484848484848
3643779,5,B001HQZJWK,"This movie was highly impressing. It honestly followed the the games. Resident Evil 2 and 4. This movie even showed a clip from Resident Evil 2. This movie connects to for by the way the President sent Leon Scott Kennedy by himself just like he did to Leon in 4 to save is only daughter, Ashley Graham. The movie also looks very...REALISTIC... but you can still slightly tell the diference between the reality and fiction. I believe I will honestly buy this movie the day it comes out as I planned and sit my girlfriend down to watch it a Spottless Mind Orange if I have to hold her eyes open lol. But overall I believe no time at all was wasted watching this movie over and over. However, my only two complaints were that it was very hard to understand at some parts, and Leon S.

3643780,4,B001HQZJWK,"I enjoyed the Resident Evil video game series.  I followed the Resident Evil movies and have been fairly critical of the bunch.
This film is definitely on the upper end in quality and entertainment when compared to the rest of the live action movies.
  I have read that ""Disney animation"" is better drawn then this.  Let's compare apples to apples.  I do not agree with the statement, and CG needs to be compared to other CG.  Not classicaly drawn cartoons.  And even in that reference, the quality of animation in this film is quite good.  Further comparision to other CG films is in favor of Resident Evil: Degeneration, i.e. Final Fantasy: Spirits within, or even Final Fantasy Advent Children; technology has come a very long way.  There are a few spots where it is obvious that you are watching an animated film but those are perfectly acceptable and probably more of a result of me being nitpicky.
  The plot was fairly straight forward.  The first 20 or so minutes were a little rough; I'll admit that.  It was a little unclear as to the motivations of some of the ""villians.""  Furthermore, in no less then 3 spots in the movie; I had to use some extra ""suspesion of belief.""
  This is a bit of a spoiler warning here, so I'll post those spots at the very end of the review (in about a paragraph).
  Overall, I enjoyed this film, and was very surprised that I liked it as much as I did.  In my opinion, the point of a movie is to be entertaining.  That goal was certainly accomplished.  I even could forget I was watching a CG film; which is a compliment to the quality of the animation.  Certainly one of the top, if not the very top of what is available in the Resident Evil movie titles.  I will also state that there were some ""Matrix-esque"" signature CG moments that were done very well.  A definite plus for those who look for such things!
  This DVD would rate as money well spent.  Great for a first watch, or on a hang out night with the guys.  Sum up, great animation, great action, great CG sequences.  Okay+ on plot, okay- in believablity, above average in entertainment.  I will probably buy the next one!

  Okay, spoiler warning, please stop reading.  I am going to spoil the ending here.
Anyways, there are some spots where I could help but do a double take at what I was watching.  There is this spot where it is revealed that this random gal a really good fighter with some gun skills.  That's great, but it takes them about 20 minutes from another character to figure it out and actually give her a gun.
Then, there's this scene where there's this guy hanging on a rope, stretched out.  In one hand he has the rope, in the other hand, he has hold of a girl, and you get that classic hanging scene.  Well, holding onto the girl, is this big monster and for like 2 minutes, this guy is holding onto this rope with one hand and the girl AND this big monster with the other.
Finally, you have the aforementioned monster.  He gets just rained on with bullets from a strike force, a giant piece of metal falls on top of him, he's caught in a big explosion, and lives through all this; only to die with, well, he dies in a very silly fashion.",1229040000,3,3161,4.3752151462994835

3643783,5,B001HQZJWK,"I expected this movie to be good, but it was better than I ever could have imagined. If you're a fan of the games, you'll recognize Claire Redfield and Leon S. Kennedy. There are also a few new characters, who by the end of the movie, you'll either love or hate. That's what is so great about the movie; you feel a connection with the characters, the new and the old.

The movie fits right in with the games, but can also be enjoyed by anyone who isn't yet familiar with the Resident Evil story. If you are familiar with the games, you'll notice slight details (for example, when Claire and Leon meet) that will have you *squee*ing with glee (I was!).

The plot was excellently written and played out. There is action in the beginning, they build on the new characters, and then more action until the end. I was never once bored watching this film, and I get can bored fairly easily. The movie never felt too short or too long, though in the end I was wishing for more in a ""I love it too much to see it end"" sort of way.

All in all, I say this one of the best movies I've ever seen. And it is most definitely the best Resident Evil movie ever made. Five Stars - Two Thumbs Up - A+!",1228608000,2,1183,4.1347826086956525

3643785,5,B001HQZJWK,"Great movie.  Easily enjoyable, the story line was great, however Sony, still makes CG movies like Final Fantasy, devoid of visible emotion and characters suffering from Botox injections.  Haven't we learned anything, less is more.  I like the photo realism, but it detracts from the actual story line.",1228348800,2,302,5.25
8309384,1,B001HQZJWK,"Normally I don't write bad reviews, but this Trilogy deserves it. I saw RE:Degeneration on regular DVD and it was pathetic.  I think they need to go back to live-action instead of CGI.  -Granted I have never seen the either of the other two (or if I have, they were forgettable), but in my opinion is that they rely to much on darkness and shadows to mask the poor CGI.
Note:  The B.OW.s in Degeneration were excellent, but human/zombie CGI just hasn't reached the point where it can do certain movies justice and this trilogy is a clear example.  Now Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, that was worth it, and CGI is great for video games, but not total RE movies; it just isn't to the level that we need it to be yet...
That is why I give this trilogy 1 star.
Sorry Resident Evil movies, that's why for now I will stick with live-action for movies for the near future:  :(",1527292800,,873,4.331288343558282
