I wanted to see it because it has an interesting cast Raul Julia, Armand assante and the hot girl from the cult film pit and the pendulum staring lance Hendrickson .

On the crucifiction they really did do that. I actually saw them do that on television in the early sixties. They considered it an honor to do it. Some died doing it. I would have been honored to put the nails in him :) it better to give then to receive as they say.",1383264000,,582,3.9743589743589745
7810365,5,6301025032,"The eternal triangle is the theme in this well acted film. Played in a back wood small south american town, old religious beliefs are tested and abused to prove  his love for his ""best fiends"" wife. Assante is the suitor, Julia is the husband, Carmen the wife, very well casted. This film has no time, no place, no social strata, it can and does happen any time, any place, any where, to any one. The unique twist is what part the Crucifixion plays. See it to believe it.",1173571200,3,471,4.3522727272727275
7810366,5,6301025032,"In many hamlets within southern Colorado, New Mexico and northern Mexico, a cult of Roman Catholic flagellants, Penitente, is active, its rites culminating each year just before Easter as one of the members from each village is chosen by lot to be crucified in the manner of Christ, and this exceptional film interlaces actions occurring from its scenario with this pious event. Raul Julia portrays Ramon Guerola, a devout penitent whose young bride Celia (Rona Freed) remains a virgin because of fear, but who is strongly attracted to Ramon's lifelong friend Juan Mateo (Armand Assante), newly released from prison and now visiting his compadre, and a romantic conflict which arises over Celia will be decided at last upon the cross. This is actor and acting teacher Cliff Osmond's only film as director, and it is simply splendid in every respect, with his screenplay spare and dramatically nuanced, and actors as strongly idiosyncratic as Julia and Assante being skillfully guided; a salutary score is contributed by Alex North and the work is deftly edited by Peter Taylor.",1110067200,,1077,5.125
