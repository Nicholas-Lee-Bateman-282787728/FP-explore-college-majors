1627908,5,B00005MM7R,"As the somewhat hokey-named ""The Thundering Mantis"" I bought the movie on a goof, then as the opening credits began, I realized this was one of my most favorite kung fu movies of all time that I saw in THEATRES as ""The Mantis Fist Fighter"".  HUGELY popular in the 70s Time Squares rounds, the movie stars the actor from ""Cantonese Iron Kung Fu"" along with the drunken mantis master --- an immediately recognizable spectacular actor who routinely plays the drunken master or the monkey master.  There is intentional comic relief, but not to a distraction.  The plot is fairly mundane --- the evil gang leaders are mad that they constantly getting shown up by a local fish seller who learns kung fu at the local Shaolin temple in his spare time.  In spite, the gang members eventuually kill everyone associated with the fighter.  Meanwhile the fighter perfects his skills by incorporating the mantis technique of a local con artist beggar and his boy protege.  The evil gang member boss, an Eagle master, in the end is the fighter's only rival.  The story is compellingly executed with tempered slapstick and comedy.  Numerous fights populate the film, involving spell-binding mantis choreography.  The final battle is extraordinarily memorable, so much so that I certainly remembered nearly every frame of the film since I saw it over 20 years ago.  A MUST for classic lovers.",989280000,17,1375,4.913419913419913

7945957,1,B00005MM7R,"Movie uses splice and cutting to make actors seem like they are doing moves they are not.

Terrible kung fu is displayed.

Watch it once to see what a bad kung fi movie is.

I would have given it 0 stars ecpect the lead actor (Beardy) is a good actor.",1168560000,,251,3.98
7945958,2,B00005MM7R,"WOW!!!  I inadvertently came across this flick, just reading the reviews on few of Leung Kar Yan movies.  This movie actually got a 4 stars,,,ARE YOU KIDDIND ME!!  Who are you people actually grading, and giving reviews on old school kung fu flicks??  Apparently, you have no idea what great Kung Fu Movies are all about.  This is the worse performance from the great Leung Kar Yan, infact I was embarrast just watching this great kung fu expert perform like he's having a siezure, and at the same time getting his ass kicked throughout the flick. This movie was a painful experience for me!! Accordingly, the two most impressive person in this flick was the villian, ""Eddie Kao"" and the kid ""Wong Yat Lung"" he did the most amazing drunken mantis I've seen in a while, which was sufficient to give this flick 2 stars.

Leung Kar Yan choreographed in approximately 29 flicks,,,I've seen 23 so far,,TRUST ME this is not a 4 star performance from him! If you really want to see a Leung Kar Yan grand performance, I suggest you see ' Cantonese Iron Kung Fu"" or ""The Sleeping Fist"",,,you will not be dissapointed!!",1147219200,,1109,4.63265306122449
7945959,5,B00005MM7R,"Obviously some of the reviewers here has lost their minds, or simply do not understand the genre. The last fight scenes of this film put it at the TOP of my list of Old school kung fu movies. The last time I saw this film was working as a projectionist at the theater in 1984. Have never forgotten this classic. I have no ideas why the dub may be ""unacceptable"" to some people, but this film is SIMPLY INCREDIBLE. If you do not understand the genre, and realize there will be bad dubbing and bad dialog, FIND another film genre to occupy your time. This film can only be appreciated by those who understand what a kung fu movie is all about! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. P.S. I wrote my master's thesis on martial arts films, so I might know what I am talking about...",1115683200,10,759,4.314685314685315
7945960,3,B00005MM7R,"First off, this is full-frame (poorly done) and English dubbed (again poorly done).  This movie would have been 10x better if it were widescreen and subtitled.  One can only wish I guess.  Overall, the movie is good but it lacks in fight scenes.  Sure there are a couple of incidents between folks here and there, but you never really get a good fight scene until the last fight.  It is a very memorable ending, and is one that will remain in your mind for a while even after the movie is over.  I can only imagine how good it would have been when viewed in it's original aspect ratio.  I recommend picking this DVD up just because it's cheap and a relatively good Kung Fu flick.  **3.5 stars**",1109462400,5,694,4.3671875
7945961,2,B00005MM7R,"I commonly look at the ""listmania"" lists of Amazon users for suggestions on Old School Kung Fu movies that I haven't seen.  ""The Thundering Mantis"" showed up on two separate user's lists so I thought it would be worth buying.  While it is defintely ""Old School"" with no wire-fu, it is weak on substance.  I think they also tried too hard to make it humerous.  The main protagonist does not seem nearly talented enough to carry this role.  The fight choreography is slow like they are only going half speed.  It does not compare to classics like Invincible Pole Fighter, Shaolin vs. Lama, Shaolin and Wu Tang, or The Prodigal Son.",1107129600,,629,4.621621621621622
