3065338,3,B0011FDVD6,"This 2 disc DVD release offers up two Jane Powell musical offerings for the year 1950,filmed and released in succession;Nancy goes to Rio released in March 0f 1950 and Two weeks with Love released later in November. Neither tend to light up the sky,so to speak,but are easy on the eyes and ears and generally a little above average musical fares;more showcases for the singing talents of its 21 year old star Jane Powell.
Nancy Goes to Rio concerns the story of a mother,Frances(Ann Southern) and her daughter Nancy(Jane Powell).Frances is an established stage star while Nancy is following in her mothers footsteps and paying her dues in lesser shows. They both live with Frances' father Gregory(Louis Calhern),an ex performer himself. When a producer from Brazil enters the picture he  offers Frances a part in his play and Frances immediately decides to go to Brazil to soak up the atmosphere and learn her lines. However the producer has second thoughts about Frances' age(the part is really for a younger girl)and after watching Nancy during a performance offers HER the part instead of her mother. Of course Nancy doesn't realize her mother has the same part and goes down to Rio to meet her. On the ship she meets bachelor Paul Berten(Barry Sullivan)who gets the wrong idea when she is rehearsing lines out loud and mistakingly thinks she is pregnant. In fact in short order everyone from the ships captain to its' doctor think she is in the family way. She is oblivious to it all and rebuffs what she thinks is Berten's advances,when he is really just showing sympathy. Nancy arrives in Rio only to finally find out that her mother has got the same part as her. She is terribly upset and steps out of the play. She suddenly shifts gears and decides to get married and Berten is the object of her affections. Alot of embarrassing moments happen between the two but when Berten meets her mother he falls instantly for HER.But not before Frances and her father have gotten over the ""fact"" that they think HE is the father of Nancy's ""baby"";and he gets a sock from Gramps to drive home the point. Once the dust finally settles the situation corrects itself and Frances steps down to let Nancy take the part and Berten and Frances live happily ever after.
The less satisfying of the two offerings here,mainly due to the meandering plot,Powell has many musical moments to shine and stand out. While watching this film I hadn't seen in years I was immediately taken back 14 years previously to 1936 and a young 15 year old singing angel and sensation Deanna Durbin. Durbin was without peer and she spawned a hunt by every studio thereafter to find another Durbin;like Powell. Some were better than others but suddenly something else hit me like a bolt of lightning. I checked my sources and yes,this film was a remake of a 1940 Deanna Durbin picture called ""It's a Date""! And I recalled another ""coincidence"";Deanna's smash/entry film was ""Three Smart Girls"" while one of Powell's earlier musical films was ""Three Daring Daughters""!Watch for ex-Little Rascal Scotty Beckett(now 21 years old also) as Nancy's boyfriend back home. And I needn't tell you to look out for Carmen Miranda because she virtually steals every scene she is in,as usual. She is the reason I got this film which was her second last and as always she never fails to disappoint. Carmen had some more serious than usual lines here and she is an absolute pro in her delivery. It is a shame she was relegated by studios to such trivial and typecast parts because she would have shone with much superior scripts,I'm sure. Watch for Hans Conried in a bit part as Frances and her father's Brazilian butler!
Two Weeks with Love concerns the story of the Robinson family,the patriarch Horatio(Calhern) is the towns' famous bandmaster. He along with the rest of the family of two boys and two girls and wife are set for a trip to their favourite resort in the  Catskill Mountains. Upon arrival daughter Patti(Powell) is not in the mood for gaiety. She is 17 trying to be 18 plus and going through much teenage angst. Much of it concerns what she thinks is her less than mature dress and especially her lack of a corset. A boy who works in the motel is smitten with Patti but Patti just can't reciprocate;while Patti's sister Melba(a young Debbie Reynolds) is the one who really digs him. In the midst of all this walks in a debonair Cuban(Ricardo Montalban) who sweeps Patti off her feet. However her friend(Phyllis Kirk) has designs of her own and constantly tries to trip her friend up to snare him for herself. There are alot of amusing mix ups during the course of the film until finally Mom and Dad realize that their little girl has grown up and her feelings for the Cuban are quite deep and sincere. In the end his intentions are made quite clear and Patti gets her man while finally blossoming into a woman.
I found this film had much more umphh to it than ""Nancy"",mainly due to the help of the light comedy throughout. Busby Berkeley choreographs the musical numbers in this film but it isn't the Berkeley of old. They are all competently done but anyone could have claimed credit for them. Debbie Reynold's is the stand out in this film as she literally steals many scenes away from the established star Powell. She is given alot of good comedic moments and her exuberance makes her shine in every one. In fact she gets to sing her first major song hit ""Abba Dabba Honeymoon"",and well done it is. Watch for a young Tommy Retig as one of Patti's younger brothers,soon to gain fame in ""The 5,000 Fingers of Dr T"".Funny enough Calhern played Powell's grandfather in ""Nancy"" but in ""Two Weeks"" he is now her father! You have to love the casting logic!
The special features on these discs are quite nice as both have a wonderful ""Pete Smith Specialty Comedy"" short(about one reel) and a Tex Avery Cartoon. Also both have their original theatrical trailers.
Technically the transfers are quite good and the colour is bright,clear and crisp.
In conclusion while I found Two Weeks with Love to be the better of the two films here as Debbie Reynolds shines throughout while Nancy goes to Rio does have its' moments;the best of which are supplied by wonderful Carmen Miranda. They are a little more than average fare but those hilarious Pete Smith shorts and Tex Avery cartoons complement them nicely.",1263686400,6,6363,4.716082659478886

3065340,5,B0011FDVD6,Jane Powell is always great to watch she is so full of life and these two movies are excellent. A must have DVD in any classic movie collection of musicals.,1252713600,,156,4.233333333333333
3065341,5,B0011FDVD6,"A must for lovers of music and talent.  Take a trip back to the day when actors were performers, triple threats were the rule, rather than the exception.

Enjoy the amazingly wondrous talents of Jane Powell and add the new kid on the block Debbie Reynolds in one of her first on-screen ventures.  Talent in the days when this fare was the golden rule and audiences were treated well by pure talent and not visual effects, poor actors and story lines enhanced by computer technology.  Not to say there aren't some good movies today, there are but not with the sheer enjoyment of the viewer in mind, nor with the exposure to such glorious voices, needing no enhancements.

Few people of this generation can even say they know of people as talented as Miss Powell.  It's a certainty, sadly, that they've never listened to people with her extraordinary talent and ability.

The movie is light, the plot very simple, a coming of age story, but the talent amazing.  It is said this was Miss Powell's favorite film, Two Weeks of Love, by the experts at TCM.

My favorite parts, Oceanic Role, Abba-Dabba Honeymoon sung wonderfully by Carlton Carpenter and Debbie Reynolds, and I believe the reason the song became a hit.  And the dream sequence where Miss Powell so beautifully sings the love song from The Chocolate Soldier will take your breath away.

Return to the hey-day of the MGM musical.  A time when viewers were treated with respect and given the experience of culture and pure outstanding talent.  A time so sorely missed and so sorely needed.  But sadly, qualities decidedly not needed by today's generation.",1243036800,,1612,4.772563176895307

Two Weeks With Love is very entertaining,clean, lots of fun and takes place in older America when things were simpler. Jane Powell, Debbie Reynolds and Recardo Montablan were very young in this.

3065379,5,B0011FDVD6,"This two DVD set of Nancy Goes to Rio and Two Weeks with Love are wonderful for Jane Powell fans and they are also classic MGM movie musicals. In addition, people who are fans of the other actors in these films would do well to add this two DVD set to their collections.

Nancy Goes to Rio may not be the very best musical ever; but then again MGM standards of quality were so high that this is still a fine motion picture! They could have cut a couple of minutes here and there but the acting and those magnificent musical numbers were so good that it all kept me curious to see how everything would work out. The choreography and the cinematography are terrific.

Nancy Barklay (Jane Powell) wants her boyfriend Scotty (Scotty Beckett) to meet her mother Frances Elliott (Ann Sothern), a successful actress who is appearing in the final performance of a great Broadway play. After the show there's a huge party for Frances back at her New York apartment; and Frances' father Gregory Elliott (Louis Calhern) hams it up to be surrounded by young women--all in good fun, of course. Another guest at the party, Ricardo Domingos (Fortunio Bonanova) from Brazil, wants Frances to star in his new play. While Ricardo is impressed by Frances, just by chance he also meets Nancy--and the trouble and hijinks start when Ricardo likes Nancy enough to give her the part instead of her mother! Family friend and director Arthur Barrett (Glenn Anders) tells Nancy not to say anything so they can handle the leading lady change diplomatically.

Frances and Gregory are already in Rio when Nancy arrives. But before Nancy can even get to Rio by ship, the plot thickens. During Nancy's voyage to Brazil there's a huge mix-up while she's practicing her lines. Paul Berten (Barry Sullivan) overhears Nancy rehearsing her lines about how she's ""going to have the baby anyway"" and Paul jumps to the conclusion that Nancy is pregnant for real! Paul tells his business partner Marina Rodrigues (Carmen Miranda) about Nancy's ""situation"" and they try to help her. This leads to a few funny scenes aboard ship when it comes to what Nancy should eat at the dinner table and more misunderstandings greatly complicate matters.

Of course there's more to the plot than this but I don't want to give away spoilers! Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how everything works out and the musical numbers are terrific.

Two Weeks with Love is another classic movie musical from MGM. The plot moves along very well and the cinematography and choreography are exceptionally well done. The acting is convincing and the musical numbers are excellent; I especially liked ""Aba Daba Honeymoon"" performed by Debbie Reynolds and Carleton Carpenter!

When the action starts the Robinson family takes a two week vacation to a resort in the Catskill Mountains in New York. Horatio Robinson (Louis Calhern) and his wife Katherine (Ann Harding) are looking forward to their vacation while seventeen year old Patti (Jane Powell) is more focused on how she may attract young men on vacation. When the family gets to the resort it isn't long before Patti, her conniving ""friend"" Valerie (Phyllis Kirk) and other young women are swept off their feet by the handsome Demi Armendez (Ricardo Montalban) who is also staying at the resort.

The arrival of Demi Armendez sets up quite a competition between Valerie and Patti for his affections; but Patti never gets a chance to impress Demi because Valerie is always beating Patti to it--not to mention that Patti's parents think that at 17 she is a year too young to be going around with boys her age, let alone men! Worse yet for Patti, her parents refuse to let her wear a woman's corset to shape her figure; this causes Patti great embarrassment when others her age find out! Patti doesn't want Demi to discover she isn't wearing any corset for fear that she'll really turn him off and far prefer Valerie to her.

Of course there's more to the plot but I won't give away spoilers so you can enjoy this film as much as I did! The rest of the film shows how everything plays out.

Look also for Clinton Sundberg as Mr. Finlay, the resort owner; Carleton Carpenter as his son Billy Finlay and Debbie Reynolds as Patti's younger sister Melba. Gary Gray and Tommy Rettig play Patti's younger brothers McCormick and Ricky Robinson.

I highly recommend Two Weeks with Love and Nancy Goes to Rio for fans of Jane Powell, the other actors in these films and anyone who appreciates classic movie musicals. People who enjoy musicals with elements of romantic comedy will not be disappointed either.",1363910400,4,4598,4.765075376884422

3065384,5,B0011FDVD6,"This may be a little long, but I have so much to say.  I am a Jane Powell fan. I had never seen either film.  The treasure is the Jane Powell interview with Robert Osborne after ""Two Weeks with Love"".  Miss Powell goes into some interesting detail about M.G.M. and the studio system.  People will find this fascinating, confusing, and I suppose a little sad.  May I set the stage?  All of the studio's worked in the same fashion.  A talent discovered.  A star is born.  How much can we make?  A star in decline.  A star no longer!  M.G.M. was so perverse in the way they used their stars.  One could say that Marion Davies was replaced by Jean Harlow.  After Miss Harlow died in 1937, the studio needed a new Harlow.  Lana Turner!  The seven year contract held the star in check for three years.  If the studio picked up the option, the star got two more years, again the option for the last two years, to finish out the seven year deal.
  By 1942, M.G.M. had dumped; Marion Davies, Louise Rainer, Garbo, Crawford, Norma Shearer, Jeannette Macdonald, to name a few.  The famous, so called ladies director; George Cukor seems to be tied to the final films of so many female stars.  One wonders how much he really helped.  Well my point is; that M.G.M. needed a new Jeannette Macdonald.  Enter Miss Powell.
  This my idea, and a good one.  M.G.M. would fashion a new Macdonald in Powell.  The stars were designed to fit a certain mold, discard the star, and use the mold to make a new star!  Here comes miss Powell.  She was assigned to Lillian Burns, the drama coach who taught all of the M.G.M. ladies to try to sound alike.  Powell had little education.  By luck and by talent, Powell became a star.  But! One can see how the studio is constantly at her ""Look"".  The hair changes color.  The brows are raised and heightened.  They gave her the infamous Crawford marvelous mouth.  The weight changes.  In glorious color, Powell manages to survive and with the singing voice, she at once breaks my heart, and gives me joy and promise.
  Ann Sothern was a marvelous actress.  Best remembered perhaps for her role in; ""A letter to three Wive's"".  Playing Powells mother In; ""Nancy goes to Rio"" at about fourty years of age, she completed her contract at M.G.M.  Nine years earlier in the lead role in the charming, ""Lady be Good"" she played the side kick of a fading star; Eleanor Powell. Southern, occupied the fifties in her role as a very funny, very to the point, and always plucky secretary.  ""Nancy goes to Rio"" gives Sothern some wonderful moments.  Sothern and Powell and Louis Calhern do a heavenly number together; ""Shine on, Harvest Moon"".  Louis Calhern  brings the two ladies together in all the glamour that men and women share.  Yes! Sothern could sing, all three put a smile on your face.  I bring ""outdated music and film"" to my students, and they just listen, and say, ""please play it again""!  There is an interesting finale, with Powell doing a not bad, Ginger Rogers routine, yes the braids in the hair ala Rogers in; ""The Barkleys of Broadway"", flowing gown and a bunch of rather bored looking male dancers.  I could not take my eyes off Powell as she danced.  The movie seems fragmented, in bits and parts that don't mesh.  We are not aware the finale is the finale,, until suddenly; "" The End "" slams on the breaks.  For movie fans the barn set used in Judy Garlands last film at M.G.M. ""Summer Stock"", is easy to pick out.

  I was prepared to dislike Two weeks with Love, but it is A+.  The film was obviously a work of love.  The color is refined and rich, subtle and sure.  Watch Powell as she glides in a boat alone on a lake, in and out of the shadows.  The color range is as beautiful as a Monet painting.  The violet and mauve colors, the willows weeping adding to the shade, as well as the dappled sunlight.  The story line is sincere, one believes it, one is able to experience gaslit rooms, a different way of life.  The actors believe in what they are doing and it pays off.  The times may have changed, and life may move too fast for some,  but the theme of growing up, and fitting in; is timeless.
  Louis Calhern is the father in the movie.  He had a way of making it look so easy, and funny, and just a little elegant. Fun comparing his performance and his ""look"" in both films.  Louis Calhern turns up in many important films of the late 1940's 1950's.  Calhern was nominated for an Oscar for his role in ""The Magnificent Yankee"".  Ann Harding portrays the mother.  Hardings career is difficult to access.  She was a star for a while in the early talkies.  I suspect her films are sadly lost.  She had this very soft silk and velvet voice, and never seemed to get upset or hysterical,,, even though one would.  She played the wife of Frederic March in ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"".

  There are opportunities galore to run amok in ""Two weeks with love"".  But it just plays out in a natural and human way.  After viewing the two films please run the Robert Osborne interview with Jane Powell.  At one point she explains that she was planning to leave M.G.M..  Do the math.  If she signed a seven year contract in 1947-48.  It would have expired in 1954-55 with her last M.G.M. film ""Hit the Deck"" 1955.  At 24-25 she was washed up?  She made a few more films ,,,, some t.v. and then a slow fade?  A clue; Debbie Reynolds is in ""Two Weeks with Love"", was she M.G.M.s new Jane Powell?  This could very well be.  Miss Reynolds had a budding career of her own on her hands and a very tough road ahead with M.G.M. In 1964 Jane Powell was thirty five years old. Was there nothing but revivals and t.v. for her?  The answer is in the Osborne interview.  Jane Powell lived as an average person would.  Now and again the studio would call her with news of a film role, and she would go to work.  I do not think the lady had an idea as to how really good she was.  I have a feeling that she has come to accept her talent, as well as her place in film history.  She is out and about and letting a curious public have a look at her.  I highly encourage the ""Ruggles of Red Gap"" cd available through amazon, with the extra material featuring Jane Powell.  Recordings made in the 1950's.  The raw power of her voice, and the way she delivers a song  will leave the listener breathless.

  These films are in mint condition.  All we need is one of the great movie houses, Radio City Music Hall in N.Y.C. or The Detroit Fox.  Some popcorn, and the beautiful sound and color.  Not long ago I was in Santa Barbara California, I was thinking of Miss Powell, hey! it hit me.  ""A Date with Judy"" took place in Santa Barbara, I started to wonder where the Foster Fish Co. was,,,,,,,,,,,,, hey, I was having a ""Most Unusual Day"".",1326412800,23,6748,4.356451612903226

3065391,5,B0011FDVD6,"I'm 29, but through my mother's passion for classic musicals, I've learnt to love the productions from the 40's, 50's and 60's. And ""Two Weeks With Love"" turned out to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Together with An American in Paris or Singin' in the rain, this film is a perfect example of a solid script and amazing, funny and absolutely perfect acting. Jane Powell and Ricardo Montalban are truly believable when playing Patty and Demi, with the right combination of social criticism and humour. The film is full of surprises (maybe today's viewers would smirk at the ""special"" effects when the fireworks go off, but once you are watching, you forgive the age for the lack of technology back then) but the film is so entertaining, so warm, so easy to relate to, so splashed with heart-warming scenes, that every time I watch it I still get surprised, my heart still rejoices or suffers with Patty's misfortunes, and I still discover little winks to the audience, little details that I missed the other times... ""Two Weeks with Love"" is and will always be, an indisputable favourite.
""Nancy Goes to Rio"", on the other hand, does not have a very solid, logical script. I certainly do not think the songs are nearly as nice as the ones in ""Two Weeks..."" and the choice of actors---specially the male cast, exclusing the one who plays her grandad, in my opinion is totally amiss: the young kid looks too young, the older suitor, just too old... ""Nancy..."" is just an ok movie, but I don't think I would watch it again if given the chance. My reason to buy the combo was to watch ""Two Weeks..."" and I'm thrilled about it, and even if I don't watch ""Nancy..."" again---- well, it's TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY!! :)",1272153600,,1718,4.599348534201955

3299835,3,B0011FDVD6,"This 2 disc DVD release offers up two Jane Powell musical offerings for the year 1950,filmed and released in succession;Nancy goes to Rio released in March 0f 1950 and Two weeks with Love released later in November. Neither tend to light up the sky,so to speak,but are easy on the eyes and ears and generally a little above average musical fares;more showcases for the singing talents of its 21 year old star Jane Powell.
Nancy Goes to Rio concerns the story of a mother,Frances(Ann Southern) and her daughter Nancy(Jane Powell).Frances is an established stage star while Nancy is following in her mothers footsteps and paying her dues in lesser shows. They both live with Frances' father Gregory(Louis Calhern),an ex performer himself. When a producer from Brazil enters the picture he  offers Frances a part in his play and Frances immediately decides to go to Brazil to soak up the atmosphere and learn her lines. However the producer has second thoughts about Frances' age(the part is really for a younger girl)and after watching Nancy during a performance offers HER the part instead of her mother. Of course Nancy doesn't realize her mother has the same part and goes down to Rio to meet her. On the ship she meets bachelor Paul Berten(Barry Sullivan)who gets the wrong idea when she is rehearsing lines out loud and mistakingly thinks she is pregnant. In fact in short order everyone from the ships captain to its' doctor think she is in the family way. She is oblivious to it all and rebuffs what she thinks is Berten's advances,when he is really just showing sympathy. Nancy arrives in Rio only to finally find out that her mother has got the same part as her. She is terribly upset and steps out of the play. She suddenly shifts gears and decides to get married and Berten is the object of her affections. Alot of embarrassing moments happen between the two but when Berten meets her mother he falls instantly for HER.But not before Frances and her father have gotten over the ""fact"" that they think HE is the father of Nancy's ""baby"";and he gets a sock from Gramps to drive home the point. Once the dust finally settles the situation corrects itself and Frances steps down to let Nancy take the part and Berten and Frances live happily ever after.
The less satisfying of the two offerings here,mainly due to the meandering plot,Powell has many musical moments to shine and stand out. While watching this film I hadn't seen in years I was immediately taken back 14 years previously to 1936 and a young 15 year old singing angel and sensation Deanna Durbin. Durbin was without peer and she spawned a hunt by every studio thereafter to find another Durbin;like Powell. Some were better than others but suddenly something else hit me like a bolt of lightning. I checked my sources and yes,this film was a remake of a 1940 Deanna Durbin picture called ""It's a Date""! And I recalled another ""coincidence"";Deanna's smash/entry film was ""Three Smart Girls"" while one of Powell's earlier musical films was ""Three Daring Daughters""!Watch for ex-Little Rascal Scotty Beckett(now 21 years old also) as Nancy's boyfriend back home. And I needn't tell you to look out for Carmen Miranda because she virtually steals every scene she is in,as usual. She is the reason I got this film which was her second last and as always she never fails to disappoint. Carmen had some more serious than usual lines here and she is an absolute pro in her delivery. It is a shame she was relegated by studios to such trivial and typecast parts because she would have shone with much superior scripts,I'm sure. Watch for Hans Conried in a bit part as Frances and her father's Brazilian butler!
Two Weeks with Love concerns the story of the Robinson family,the patriarch Horatio(Calhern) is the towns' famous bandmaster. He along with the rest of the family of two boys and two girls and wife are set for a trip to their favourite resort in the  Catskill Mountains. Upon arrival daughter Patti(Powell) is not in the mood for gaiety. She is 17 trying to be 18 plus and going through much teenage angst. Much of it concerns what she thinks is her less than mature dress and especially her lack of a corset. A boy who works in the motel is smitten with Patti but Patti just can't reciprocate;while Patti's sister Melba(a young Debbie Reynolds) is the one who really digs him. In the midst of all this walks in a debonair Cuban(Ricardo Montalban) who sweeps Patti off her feet. However her friend(Phyllis Kirk) has designs of her own and constantly tries to trip her friend up to snare him for herself. There are alot of amusing mix ups during the course of the film until finally Mom and Dad realize that their little girl has grown up and her feelings for the Cuban are quite deep and sincere. In the end his intentions are made quite clear and Patti gets her man while finally blossoming into a woman.
I found this film had much more umphh to it than ""Nancy"",mainly due to the help of the light comedy throughout. Busby Berkeley choreographs the musical numbers in this film but it isn't the Berkeley of old. They are all competently done but anyone could have claimed credit for them. Debbie Reynold's is the stand out in this film as she literally steals many scenes away from the established star Powell. She is given alot of good comedic moments and her exuberance makes her shine in every one. In fact she gets to sing her first major song hit ""Abba Dabba Honeymoon"",and well done it is. Watch for a young Tommy Retig as one of Patti's younger brothers,soon to gain fame in ""The 5,000 Fingers of Dr T"".Funny enough Calhern played Powell's grandfather in ""Nancy"" but in ""Two Weeks"" he is now her father! You have to love the casting logic!
The special features on these discs are quite nice as both have a wonderful ""Pete Smith Specialty Comedy"" short(about one reel) and a Tex Avery Cartoon. Also both have their original theatrical trailers.
Technically the transfers are quite good and the colour is bright,clear and crisp.
In conclusion while I found Two Weeks with Love to be the better of the two films here as Debbie Reynolds shines throughout while Nancy goes to Rio does have its' moments;the best of which are supplied by wonderful Carmen Miranda. They are a little more than average fare but those hilarious Pete Smith shorts and Tex Avery cartoons complement them nicely.",1263686400,6,6363,4.716082659478886

3299838,5,B0011FDVD6,"A must for lovers of music and talent.  Take a trip back to the day when actors were performers, triple threats were the rule, rather than the exception.

Enjoy the amazingly wondrous talents of Jane Powell and add the new kid on the block Debbie Reynolds in one of her first on-screen ventures.  Talent in the days when this fare was the golden rule and audiences were treated well by pure talent and not visual effects, poor actors and story lines enhanced by computer technology.  Not to say there aren't some good movies today, there are but not with the sheer enjoyment of the viewer in mind, nor with the exposure to such glorious voices, needing no enhancements.

Few people of this generation can even say they know of people as talented as Miss Powell.  It's a certainty, sadly, that they've never listened to people with her extraordinary talent and ability.

The movie is light, the plot very simple, a coming of age story, but the talent amazing.  It is said this was Miss Powell's favorite film, Two Weeks of Love, by the experts at TCM.

My favorite parts, Oceanic Role, Abba-Dabba Honeymoon sung wonderfully by Carlton Carpenter and Debbie Reynolds, and I believe the reason the song became a hit.  And the dream sequence where Miss Powell so beautifully sings the love song from The Chocolate Soldier will take your breath away.

Return to the hey-day of the MGM musical.  A time when viewers were treated with respect and given the experience of culture and pure outstanding talent.  A time so sorely missed and so sorely needed.  But sadly, qualities decidedly not needed by today's generation.",1243036800,,1612,4.772563176895307

3299876,5,B0011FDVD6,"This two DVD set of Nancy Goes to Rio and Two Weeks with Love are wonderful for Jane Powell fans and they are also classic MGM movie musicals. In addition, people who are fans of the other actors in these films would do well to add this two DVD set to their collections.

Nancy Goes to Rio may not be the very best musical ever; but then again MGM standards of quality were so high that this is still a fine motion picture! They could have cut a couple of minutes here and there but the acting and those magnificent musical numbers were so good that it all kept me curious to see how everything would work out. The choreography and the cinematography are terrific.

Nancy Barklay (Jane Powell) wants her boyfriend Scotty (Scotty Beckett) to meet her mother Frances Elliott (Ann Sothern), a successful actress who is appearing in the final performance of a great Broadway play. After the show there's a huge party for Frances back at her New York apartment; and Frances' father Gregory Elliott (Louis Calhern) hams it up to be surrounded by young women--all in good fun, of course. Another guest at the party, Ricardo Domingos (Fortunio Bonanova) from Brazil, wants Frances to star in his new play. While Ricardo is impressed by Frances, just by chance he also meets Nancy--and the trouble and hijinks start when Ricardo likes Nancy enough to give her the part instead of her mother! Family friend and director Arthur Barrett (Glenn Anders) tells Nancy not to say anything so they can handle the leading lady change diplomatically.

Frances and Gregory are already in Rio when Nancy arrives. But before Nancy can even get to Rio by ship, the plot thickens. During Nancy's voyage to Brazil there's a huge mix-up while she's practicing her lines. Paul Berten (Barry Sullivan) overhears Nancy rehearsing her lines about how she's ""going to have the baby anyway"" and Paul jumps to the conclusion that Nancy is pregnant for real! Paul tells his business partner Marina Rodrigues (Carmen Miranda) about Nancy's ""situation"" and they try to help her. This leads to a few funny scenes aboard ship when it comes to what Nancy should eat at the dinner table and more misunderstandings greatly complicate matters.

Of course there's more to the plot than this but I don't want to give away spoilers! Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how everything works out and the musical numbers are terrific.

Two Weeks with Love is another classic movie musical from MGM. The plot moves along very well and the cinematography and choreography are exceptionally well done. The acting is convincing and the musical numbers are excellent; I especially liked ""Aba Daba Honeymoon"" performed by Debbie Reynolds and Carleton Carpenter!

When the action starts the Robinson family takes a two week vacation to a resort in the Catskill Mountains in New York. Horatio Robinson (Louis Calhern) and his wife Katherine (Ann Harding) are looking forward to their vacation while seventeen year old Patti (Jane Powell) is more focused on how she may attract young men on vacation. When the family gets to the resort it isn't long before Patti, her conniving ""friend"" Valerie (Phyllis Kirk) and other young women are swept off their feet by the handsome Demi Armendez (Ricardo Montalban) who is also staying at the resort.

The arrival of Demi Armendez sets up quite a competition between Valerie and Patti for his affections; but Patti never gets a chance to impress Demi because Valerie is always beating Patti to it--not to mention that Patti's parents think that at 17 she is a year too young to be going around with boys her age, let alone men! Worse yet for Patti, her parents refuse to let her wear a woman's corset to shape her figure; this causes Patti great embarrassment when others her age find out! Patti doesn't want Demi to discover she isn't wearing any corset for fear that she'll really turn him off and far prefer Valerie to her.

Of course there's more to the plot but I won't give away spoilers so you can enjoy this film as much as I did! The rest of the film shows how everything plays out.

Look also for Clinton Sundberg as Mr. Finlay, the resort owner; Carleton Carpenter as his son Billy Finlay and Debbie Reynolds as Patti's younger sister Melba. Gary Gray and Tommy Rettig play Patti's younger brothers McCormick and Ricky Robinson.

I highly recommend Two Weeks with Love and Nancy Goes to Rio for fans of Jane Powell, the other actors in these films and anyone who appreciates classic movie musicals. People who enjoy musicals with elements of romantic comedy will not be disappointed either.",1363910400,4,4598,4.765075376884422

3299881,5,B0011FDVD6,"This may be a little long, but I have so much to say.  I am a Jane Powell fan. I had never seen either film.  The treasure is the Jane Powell interview with Robert Osborne after ""Two Weeks with Love"".  Miss Powell goes into some interesting detail about M.G.M. and the studio system.  People will find this fascinating, confusing, and I suppose a little sad.  May I set the stage?  All of the studio's worked in the same fashion.  A talent discovered.  A star is born.  How much can we make?  A star in decline.  A star no longer!  M.G.M. was so perverse in the way they used their stars.  One could say that Marion Davies was replaced by Jean Harlow.  After Miss Harlow died in 1937, the studio needed a new Harlow.  Lana Turner!  The seven year contract held the star in check for three years.  If the studio picked up the option, the star got two more years, again the option for the last two years, to finish out the seven year deal.
  By 1942, M.G.M. had dumped; Marion Davies, Louise Rainer, Garbo, Crawford, Norma Shearer, Jeannette Macdonald, to name a few.  The famous, so called ladies director; George Cukor seems to be tied to the final films of so many female stars.  One wonders how much he really helped.  Well my point is; that M.G.M. needed a new Jeannette Macdonald.  Enter Miss Powell.
  This my idea, and a good one.  M.G.M. would fashion a new Macdonald in Powell.  The stars were designed to fit a certain mold, discard the star, and use the mold to make a new star!  Here comes miss Powell.  She was assigned to Lillian Burns, the drama coach who taught all of the M.G.M. ladies to try to sound alike.  Powell had little education.  By luck and by talent, Powell became a star.  But! One can see how the studio is constantly at her ""Look"".  The hair changes color.  The brows are raised and heightened.  They gave her the infamous Crawford marvelous mouth.  The weight changes.  In glorious color, Powell manages to survive and with the singing voice, she at once breaks my heart, and gives me joy and promise.
  Ann Sothern was a marvelous actress.  Best remembered perhaps for her role in; ""A letter to three Wive's"".  Playing Powells mother In; ""Nancy goes to Rio"" at about fourty years of age, she completed her contract at M.G.M.  Nine years earlier in the lead role in the charming, ""Lady be Good"" she played the side kick of a fading star; Eleanor Powell. Southern, occupied the fifties in her role as a very funny, very to the point, and always plucky secretary.  ""Nancy goes to Rio"" gives Sothern some wonderful moments.  Sothern and Powell and Louis Calhern do a heavenly number together; ""Shine on, Harvest Moon"".  Louis Calhern  brings the two ladies together in all the glamour that men and women share.  Yes! Sothern could sing, all three put a smile on your face.  I bring ""outdated music and film"" to my students, and they just listen, and say, ""please play it again""!  There is an interesting finale, with Powell doing a not bad, Ginger Rogers routine, yes the braids in the hair ala Rogers in; ""The Barkleys of Broadway"", flowing gown and a bunch of rather bored looking male dancers.  I could not take my eyes off Powell as she danced.  The movie seems fragmented, in bits and parts that don't mesh.  We are not aware the finale is the finale,, until suddenly; "" The End "" slams on the breaks.  For movie fans the barn set used in Judy Garlands last film at M.G.M. ""Summer Stock"", is easy to pick out.

  I was prepared to dislike Two weeks with Love, but it is A+.  The film was obviously a work of love.  The color is refined and rich, subtle and sure.  Watch Powell as she glides in a boat alone on a lake, in and out of the shadows.  The color range is as beautiful as a Monet painting.  The violet and mauve colors, the willows weeping adding to the shade, as well as the dappled sunlight.  The story line is sincere, one believes it, one is able to experience gaslit rooms, a different way of life.  The actors believe in what they are doing and it pays off.  The times may have changed, and life may move too fast for some,  but the theme of growing up, and fitting in; is timeless.
  Louis Calhern is the father in the movie.  He had a way of making it look so easy, and funny, and just a little elegant. Fun comparing his performance and his ""look"" in both films.  Louis Calhern turns up in many important films of the late 1940's 1950's.  Calhern was nominated for an Oscar for his role in ""The Magnificent Yankee"".  Ann Harding portrays the mother.  Hardings career is difficult to access.  She was a star for a while in the early talkies.  I suspect her films are sadly lost.  She had this very soft silk and velvet voice, and never seemed to get upset or hysterical,,, even though one would.  She played the wife of Frederic March in ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"".

  There are opportunities galore to run amok in ""Two weeks with love"".  But it just plays out in a natural and human way.  After viewing the two films please run the Robert Osborne interview with Jane Powell.  At one point she explains that she was planning to leave M.G.M..  Do the math.  If she signed a seven year contract in 1947-48.  It would have expired in 1954-55 with her last M.G.M. film ""Hit the Deck"" 1955.  At 24-25 she was washed up?  She made a few more films ,,,, some t.v. and then a slow fade?  A clue; Debbie Reynolds is in ""Two Weeks with Love"", was she M.G.M.s new Jane Powell?  This could very well be.  Miss Reynolds had a budding career of her own on her hands and a very tough road ahead with M.G.M. In 1964 Jane Powell was thirty five years old. Was there nothing but revivals and t.v. for her?  The answer is in the Osborne interview.  Jane Powell lived as an average person would.  Now and again the studio would call her with news of a film role, and she would go to work.  I do not think the lady had an idea as to how really good she was.  I have a feeling that she has come to accept her talent, as well as her place in film history.  She is out and about and letting a curious public have a look at her.  I highly encourage the ""Ruggles of Red Gap"" cd available through amazon, with the extra material featuring Jane Powell.  Recordings made in the 1950's.  The raw power of her voice, and the way she delivers a song  will leave the listener breathless.

  These films are in mint condition.  All we need is one of the great movie houses, Radio City Music Hall in N.Y.C. or The Detroit Fox.  Some popcorn, and the beautiful sound and color.  Not long ago I was in Santa Barbara California, I was thinking of Miss Powell, hey! it hit me.  ""A Date with Judy"" took place in Santa Barbara, I started to wonder where the Foster Fish Co. was,,,,,,,,,,,,, hey, I was having a ""Most Unusual Day"".",1326412800,23,6748,4.356451612903226

3299888,5,B0011FDVD6,"I'm 29, but through my mother's passion for classic musicals, I've learnt to love the productions from the 40's, 50's and 60's. And ""Two Weeks With Love"" turned out to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Together with An American in Paris or Singin' in the rain, this film is a perfect example of a solid script and amazing, funny and absolutely perfect acting. Jane Powell and Ricardo Montalban are truly believable when playing Patty and Demi, with the right combination of social criticism and humour. The film is full of surprises (maybe today's viewers would smirk at the ""special"" effects when the fireworks go off, but once you are watching, you forgive the age for the lack of technology back then) but the film is so entertaining, so warm, so easy to relate to, so splashed with heart-warming scenes, that every time I watch it I still get surprised, my heart still rejoices or suffers with Patty's misfortunes, and I still discover little winks to the audience, little details that I missed the other times... ""Two Weeks with Love"" is and will always be, an indisputable favourite.
""Nancy Goes to Rio"", on the other hand, does not have a very solid, logical script. I certainly do not think the songs are nearly as nice as the ones in ""Two Weeks..."" and the choice of actors---specially the male cast, exclusing the one who plays her grandad, in my opinion is totally amiss: the young kid looks too young, the older suitor, just too old... ""Nancy..."" is just an ok movie, but I don't think I would watch it again if given the chance. My reason to buy the combo was to watch ""Two Weeks..."" and I'm thrilled about it, and even if I don't watch ""Nancy..."" again---- well, it's TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY!! :)",1272153600,,1718,4.599348534201955

8241742,5,B0011FDVD6,"This is really a good movie - entertaining and enjoyable music! For folks who don't worry about the movie this one was made after, and just accept it on its own, should thoroughly enjoy this. 'Critics' make too much of Jane Powell over wonderful Ann Sothern. [Critics ruin a good movie and shouldn't be listened to any way! That is probably why this movie didn't take in as much paycheck! It was not due to the wonderful ladies! After all, it is like personal reviews - personal opinion!]  Yes, Jane is great, yet Ann's voice is so rich and pleasant to listen to, and just great to watch. If there was any 'irritating' portion, it was when Nancy/Jane tries a love-drippy act with Paul/ Barry Sullivan. The costumes are absolutely lovely - and, I will add, should be so lovely nowadays, 2016! Enhancing a woman! [Except possibly the brownish color evening gown, that really doesn't do much for loveliness, but some folks can get away with because the lady is lovely! Personal opinion :) ] The pastels are very flattering. And again, Ann Sothern was lovely and appealing no matter what!  And I enjoyed seeing Carmen Miranda in a simpler role and still add to the color! I enjoy seeing her lovely self without all the head gear! She also did so in a couple films with wonderful Alice Faye until studios did what the other review said and started phasing them out. One can't lose for this enjoyable movie. Just love it and wish for more of Ann Sothern's voice. They could have successfully included her in the closing number, such as a mom-daughter duet for an encore. {even if she had bowed out w/ option for a happy marriage :) in the show.] Just sit back and enjoy!",1466640000,,1664,4.543333333333333

8241750,3,B0011FDVD6,"There are excellent, appreciative reviews posted here for the wonderful Jane Powell. Such a shame she was not cast to her potential but her talent and personality (basically playing herself, but well) manage to capture her audience regardless of the material. MGM decided she would be the Deanna Durbin/girl next door and that was that. At least she really sang her own numbers. Perhaps ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" is her best cast role and my favorite so far. ""Nancy Goes to Rio"" appears to be the MGM second string crew  with the exception of Cedric Gibbons who seems always to be the art director. Surprisingly I was slightly tempted to fast forward through the musical numbers and instead enjoyed the cast and dialogue. Ann Sothern, Barry Sullivan, Louis Calhern, and even Carmen Miranda were delightful as was Powell. The musical numbers and choreography are blah and do not suit Powell particularly well but she shines through. For me Jane Powell is more enjoyable than Debbie Reynolds but both endured material beneath their talent with stellar exceptions like ""Seven Brides"" - worthy role for Powell and ""Singing in the Rain"" - worthy musical that brought Reynolds up to its standard which she never reached again. Coincidentally both of these films were regarded by MGM as ""so so"" box office potential not on the ""A"" list.

""Two Weeks of Love"" was the sort of period, family story that Mayer loved and is good at what it aimed to be.

Both of these movies are not too dated and retain pacing that modern viewers can be comfortable with. Unilike for examable MGM's ""Ziegfield's Follies which is nearly unwatchable except for some curiosities and the  pairing of Astaire and Gene Kelly in one number.",1419984000,,1713,4.876288659793815
