1203101,5,B00000F35F,"I am both a fan of John Masters (author of the historical novel, ""The Deceivers"") and a professional anthropologist dealing with the cultures of India. This film is an undiscovered masterpiece! It is faithful  to the written version in a rare way; but, it also portrays India, its  culture, its peoples, and its history during the Rajput era in a manner  that remains unexcelled by documentary films more explicitly tailored  toward so doing. I recommend this movie to anyone seeking a good mystery; a  good adventure; or a worthwhile excursion into Rajput era India. It is a  shame that it has not been reissued.

1203176,5,B00000F35F,"Usually, I like novels better than the films that are made from them. This movie helped me imagine more fully the world of pre-Raj 1830s India that Anglo-Indian novelist John Masters wrote about -- the landscapes, the clothing, the customs, the people. I was struck by the complex acting skills of the Indian cast, and later found out that many of the leads were famous (and rightly so) in the film industry in the subcontinent. Pierce Brosnan pales in comparison. Masters' novels of India past are great reads; this film fleshes out the picture.",1361232000,3,546,4.819148936170213

1203179,3,B00000F35F,"If the locals in India and Arabia accepted Sir Richard Francis Burton as one of their own, then I have no problem with Pierce Brosnan passing for Indian as well.  The subcontinent boasts a wide range of ethnic types, and in the 19th century if someone said he was from, say, Kerala, who in Rajasthan would know differently?  I'd accept the rationalization of a dark tan on Brosnan's character long before I would his feeble dark makeup, however.  The tan worked for Burton.  I doubt makeup would have done so.

Typically lavish Merchant-Ivory production: beautiful to look at, accurate, and filled with eye-candy.  Unfortunately, director Meyer seems to utilize only one camera position throughout the entire film.  This might work with a period romance, but THE DECEIVERS is full of action that calls for camera movement.  After awhile the repetitious positioning becomes downright boring, since it makes every scene look exactly like its predecessor, whether a cavalry charge or a two-shot full of dialogue.

Incidentally, that cavalry charge was concocted by someone utterly ignorant of military tactics.  The British cavalry goes racing down a dry riverbed while the bad guys (the Thugs) pick them off from high up on the river bank.  The charge is an invitation to a massacre.  But it looks pretty (apparently the main object of the film).  Potentially dramatic scenes are robbed of all urgency by the staginess of the direction.  The murder early in the film of a British officer and his two attendants could have been framed and shot better by any halfway decent B-horror movie director.

Brosnan does fine, the Indian actors all excellent, the gal playing Brosnan's wife is as wooden as a broomstick and about as alluring/sultry as a painted medallion, and her father a caricature.  Several subplots intrigue us (Brosnan's butler, a potential romantic rival) and then just evaporate with no resolution.  And as the reviewer from Argentina points out, if you can make a hunt for a wounded tiger boring, you have some serious problems with direction.

I'd say Kali should sue, but if the volume of donations at her main temple in Kokata is any indication, she doesn't need the money.",1345075200,2,2189,4.983471074380165
1203180,4,B00000F35F,"This is an entertaining film; however, it is not directed by James Ivory, as some reviewers imply; it is directed by Nicholas Meyer.  The producer, however, is Ismail Merchant, who later teamed with director James Ivory and created several sumptuous and intelligent films.",1263513600,2,272,5.325581395348837
1203181,3,B00000F35F,"Good production values, but here and as usual, these David-Lean-wannabes Merchant & Ivory tend to be pretentious (The Remains of the Day) when not downright pathetic (Le Divorce).

Good photography and a good recreation of the early XIXth century India, but probably is there where all verosimilitude ends. The hollywoodesque daring escape of the hero when surrounded by a multitude of thugs and his last minute rescue by the requisite cavalry regiment; his appropriate delivery of justice by his own hand or the betrayal by an unsuspecting friend indicate that the whole thing was 99% fiction (one Amazon reviewer even reports that the thugs never existed in reality).

You also have to suspend disbelief on the thugs accepting Pierce Brosnan (or any British officer) as one of their own. Let alone the impossibility of avoiding speaking with an accent when talking a foreign language; think of the colour of the skin (at one point, Brosnan is naked before a thug, who notices nothing) or the many cultural details a foreigner cannot possibly know, which could spell disaster any minute.

Many subplots (the seemingly ominous butler, the comrade-on-arms that tries to seduce the hero's wife and turns out to be something else) lead nowhere, suggesting the producers were trying to fill the 98 minutes with anything. Similarly, the film drags for the first twenty minutes until it starts moving.

The story is also handicapped with a tribute to extrasensorial nonsense: ""I've seen your husband in my dreams, and he is in danger"" says an Indian character, and the wife acts upon that --apparently reliable-- orientalism.

Summing up: the film is good and moderately entertaining, but it could be much better. They could have omitted the ""based on a true story part"" since probably the only factual bit was that in 1825 there was a country called India, with British soldiers riding around wearing funny hats.",1261612800,,1907,5.060509554140127
1203182,4,B00000F35F,"""The romance and the fiction of thuggee are seductive, but they are not part of the truth, only serving a European desire for India to be exotic, mysterious and dangerous. It was orientalism, the myth of the east, and surely should have died long ago."".(Kevin Rushby, Children of Kali, 2002).
To see ""The Deceivers"", having read Rushby's book, that correctly points out how the criminal myth never existed is fascinating. The movie is directly derived from John Master's 1952 novel, which is in its own an engrossing read. So the story is there, complicated, with a moral, or absence of moral and many subplots to explore. The film is a Merchan-Ivory production so the best non-Indian filmography on India that it was possible to get in the 1980's, the actors are all very good because the Brits are played by Brits and the Indians by Indians.
However, it must be seen as an imaginary story and not as the truth. The Thugs as such, a cult based on the goddess Kali never existed. Their existence was invented by the British Raj probably with the intent of repressing banditry in India, and further propagated by the nineteenth century novelist such as Sue, Meadows, Salgari.
The original British soldier on which William Savage, the story's hero is based is William Henry Sleeman a famous ""Thug exterminator"" of the first part of the nineteenth century, who lived in India for many years and had many Indian bandits jailed and killed.
If you are interested in the Kali cult and love movies, see ""Karan Arjun"" a Bollywood movie on Kali cult and reincarnation that entertains and makes you touch the essence of this religeous practice.
One point that makes the movie particularly intrigant is the fascination of Willam Savage with the concept of ritual killing, that never really leaves him also at the end of the story. He is like a controlled serial killer, who can live his true nature only outside his ""civilization"", in the natural environment of the colonial country.
This is a very good movie and an interesting example of ""Orientalism"" (E.Said). I suggest to view it with some historical backround, a touch of irony and great enjoyment of the characters (especially the Indians), costumes and locations.",1233446400,,2209,4.877659574468085
1203183,4,B00000F35F,"A truly mesmerizing and gripping story, based on true events.  Along with the main character, you will be wondering who to trust.",1232236800,2,129,4.863636363636363
1203224,3,B00000F35F,"Ismail Merchant's take on the Thugs, his long-cherished dream project The Deceivers, is less successful than Hammer's notorious Stranglers of Bombay despite having more to work with. John Master's novel is a good yarn and Michael Hirst's script is excellent, but Pierce Brosnan isn't a strong enough lead as the Brit (appropriately named Savage) who disguises himself as an Indian to gather evidence on the Thugs only to find that he enjoys killing too much for the good of his soul. Nor is Nicholas Meyer the right director - this needed a bolder widescreen treatment from an old-time sadist like John Guillermin to really catch fire. But it's still an interesting film that holds on the strength of its story, and when it does work, it works extremely well. The surprisingly bleak finale is a definite plus and quite beautifully handled.

Despite the fascinating story of the film's troubled production, the only extra is a trailer. You'll have to try to track down a copy of Hullabaloo in Old Jeypore, Merchant's slightly self-aggrandizing account of his myriad misfortunes during the controversial shoot the film in India - including the company finding themselves locked up at one point - and it's a worthwhile read, even if it should perhaps be subtitled `101 Reasons I'll Never Work With Tim Van Rellim Again.'",1141516800,5,1317,4.986363636363636
1203225,5,B00000F35F,"Based on a John Masters novel, Merchant Ivory Films brings to the screen a true and deeply disturbing tale of dark spirituality from exotic India, circa 1825.

Pierce Brosnan plays the part of William Savage (a rather interesting choice for a last name considering the subject matter of this film), a British Captain who accidently uncovers the existence of a sinister cult of assassins dedicated to the service and worship of the bloodthirsty Goddess Kali. They are the ""Thugee"", meaning 'deceivers' and they wander the mainroads disguised as holy pilgrims or jewel carriers. They befriend unwary travellers encountered along the way and quickly earn their trust, all the while intending to rob and kill them when night falls.

Unable to gain the support of his superior officers to help stamp out the robberies and ritualistic murders being carried out by this evil cult, Captain Savage decides to try and expose the Thugee cult by becoming one of them. He disguises himself as Gopal, a local villager who mysteriously disappeared some months earlier. This is an identity that he has taken once before. Gopal's wife has been plagued with re-occurring dreams of her husband's death since his absence and she now considers herself a widow. As was the custom of the time, she had decided to proceed with the ceremony of sati, self-immolation on a funeral pyre. Captain Savage had been successful in his brief masquerade as Gopal, fooling the distraught woman well enough to bring about a temporary postponement in her impending death. But would this same disguise work with the Thugee?

The disguise works and soon he is drawn into the inner circle of the Thugee. Initially utilized as a gravedigger, he is forced to passively observe the horrific ritual murders carried out by the assassins. However, in time his desire to destroy them is slowly but surely overshadowed by an evergrowing fascination with their ways and the black Goddess. He receives instruction in the strangulation methods used by the sect and is soon proficient in the process. Though he has yet to kill, it seems only a matter of time before he does.

The moment of truth is fast approaching. Gopal/Captain Savage is warned by Hussein, a fellow deceiver and the only one who knows his true identity, not to take part in an upcoming Thugee dedication ceremony to Kali. A form of communion will be taken amongst the believers distributed by a Priest of of the Goddess. It's just a small cube of sugar called the ""sweetness of Kali"", but it has been consecrated to the Goddess. To eat of ""the sweetness"" is to belong forever to Her. Convinced that his God is more powerful than this primitive Hindu deity he doesn't heed Hussein's warning and partakes of Kali's gift as the Priest recites, ""You are Hers, She is Yours.""

The ceremony turns out to be more powerful than anticipated. The spirit of Kali has now completely overshadowed the once honorable Captain and before long he strangles his first unsuspecting victim.

What an amazing depiction of psycho-spiritual transformation and the inherent dangers of tampering with ancient and powerful occult forces. The total interior devastation wrought upon Captain Savage is absolutely heartbreaking. You can almost sense the presence of Kali joyfully dancing in the unholy flames of the ""burning ground"" at the conclusion. She is truly the Goddess of Destruction. This film is all the more disquieting knowing it was based on a true account.

Filmed in India, the cinematography artfully and faithfully captures the time period and locations in this exotic tale of exploration into the darker corners of Hindu spirituality. Wonderful performances by all, especially Pierce Brosnan, Saeed Jaffrey (Hussein) and Neena Gupta (the widow).",1119830400,25,3751,5.050080775444265
1203226,3,B00000F35F,"This is an interesting exploration of the Thuggee cult of India, as it existed in the mid nineteenth century. Members of this cult worshipped the goddess, Kali, and were called ""Thugs"". Known to each other through secret phrases and rituals, the Thugs, who were an organized group of professional robbers, had a most interesting modus operandi. They would kill innocent travelers by garroting them with a weighted scarf, relieve them of their worldly goods, and then bury them so that they would seem to have vanished off the face of the earth. During their existence, members of the Thuggee cult were estimated to have killed over two million people, before being wiped out by the British, with the cooperation of the existing Indian government of that time.

This film, based upon a book of the same name by John Masters, explores this ancient, secret society. It features Pierce Brosnan as a British officer, William Savage, who comes upon this cult in action. He further investigates, but his efforts prove futile, until he manages to infiltrate this cult, disguised as a native of India. He does this with the aid of a Thug, who believes that the goddess Kali has turned her back on him.

As the film progresses, Gopal, as William Savage now calls himself, becomes enmeshed in the activities of the cult. So great is his involvement, that he is in danger of losing himself to its tenets. It is as if he were undergoing a personal psychosis. It is not until his Thug informant realizes what is happening to him and tries to assist him, resulting in British troops coming to the rescue, that Gophal/William snaps out of his role playing. It is William's infiltration of the Thuggee cult, however, that is the catalyst for subsequent action taken to wipe out this evil and murderous society.

This film, shot entirely in India, is well acted, for the most part. The only problem is Pierce Brosnan, who, in the lead role, is decidedly miscast, though he does a more than passable Indian accent. He is simply not a good fit for the role. Nonetheless, this is still an intriguing film that deals with a little known, though fascinating, segment of Indian history and worth watching.",1093824000,,2181,4.795212765957447
1203227,5,B00000F35F,"""The Deceivers"" is one of a generational series of deeply penetrating books by John Masters on India before it gained Dominion status (1947).  The British Colonel Savage faces one crisis.  His son, a Lt. Savage, later faces another critical series of events in India.  The second story is entitled: ""The Night Runners of Bengal"".
  Stay away from ""Bhowani Junction"" featuring Ava Gardner.  That low-caliber sequel severely smacks of ghostwriting.

1203228,5,B00000F35F,"I took a Indian Literature course (great stuff to study) and did a paper on this movie when it was first released. It is amazing how well it was produced. It captures a british soldier's intoxication with the eastern culture so much so that as he tries to infiltrate the Thugee cult (worshippers of Kali), he becomes one of them and it pretty much takes someone else to get him out. The Thugees were notorious for their orgasmic rituals of killing. Also, the word ""thug"" originates from their name of the cult. Somebody should release this on DVD. It's a great movie that didn't get wide spread release/recognition. Also, in this horrible age of re-hash...someone may want to look at remaking this movie of the modern viewer (which is still me).

1203230,5,B00000F35F,"THE DECEIVERS is a surpisingly captivating film, seducing us as well as the main character -- before any of us know it, we're all caught up in the Thuggee world.  The movie wisely underplays its hand, eschewing narration and letting us follow Captain Savage's descent into near-madness.  The movie also deserves plaudits for not giving us a cut-and-dried ""happy ending,"" making the film far more haunting than if the filmmakers had left things neat and tidy.
Pierce Brosnan turns in a sterling performance as Captain Savage, capturing every nuance of his situation.  Some reviewers have singled out Brosnan's performance for faint praise or outright disdain, but I can only figure that they're reacting to the ""Bond"" image rather than actually viewing Brosnan's performance (or bothering to truly evaluate and understand his career, which is punctuated with many challenging roles and first-rate performances, from a bit part in THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY to THE FOURTH PROTOCOL to THE TAILOR OF PANAMA).  Make no mistake, Brosnan's is a great performance, and THE DECEIVERS may be my favorite of his films.",1030579200,42,1101,5.168539325842697
1203231,3,B00000F35F,"This is a Merchant/Ivory film before they became masters of their craft, nonetheless this is a worthwhile film for those interested in the secret society of Kali worshipping assassins known as Thugs(pronounced Tugs), a society which some historians believe  began as a pagan cult in ancient times. What makes the Thugs so dangerous is that they are consummate actors and so able to pass themselves off as respectable citizens and thus befriend their victims. Furthermore the cult is impenetrable to the British who seek to flush them out because even those non-thug Indians who know of the thugs existence either fear reporting them or tolerate them because they serve a goddess.
Captain Savage is a soldier who at the beginning of the film finds himself attracted to an Indian woman about to commit sati. In an attempt to save her he 'goes native'.  This Indian woman  has captured his desire more than his new wife. As we get to know him we can see he is particularly vulnerable to the mysterious allures of the land he is in. In the Indian disguise which he takes great pleasure in wearing he begins to uncover the secrets of the Kali sect but as he uncovers the secrets of their strangely sensual form of murder he also becomes attracted to it for the pleasure of serving Kali it is said elicits the greatest bliss.
In a moment of deep delirium Captain Savage now in deep cover and a member of the sect he is investigating goes over to the other side....or does he?
The film leaves no doubt just which side Captain Savage comes out on but I won't spoil it for you. The film is admittedly as gaudy as the subject matter, nowhere near the majesty of later Merchant/Ivory productions, but it is a fascinating study of the strangely malleable nature of colonial identity.
The best acting here is done by the Indian actors, the English parts are all played by mere mediocrities. Brosnan plays the lead and, well, he does an adequate job. An actor with a believably dark side would have been better suited to take this perilous journey.",1013299200,17,2034,4.66016713091922

Here, he plays a British officer in British-controlled India who goes undercover to infiltrate a murderous cult called the Thuggee. Their method is to strangle their victims, rob them, and bury the bodies. Brosnan slowly loses his identity and starts to get off on the killing. It's what he learns about himself that is the most disturbing part of the story. By the end, when he throws away his crucifix, you know that his old beliefs and his wife's love can't help him any longer.

The production design including the costumes and period details was excellent. Unfortunately, the film never really took off.
