765272,5,6304039115,"This movie brings home one of the reasons why Southerners remember the war so much more vividly than the rest of the country. For many Southerners the war wasn't over ""there"" it was fought in their midst. In their barnyards, schoolyards and front yards, and in certain regions of the South, the war was fought with their neighbors.

This movie is just one story, but it reminds us of all the incidents in the war that never made it into the battle epics. The characters are civilians, and in the end nobody appears as clean as the fallen snow. Everybody is soiled by the war. This isn't an uplifting movie, in fact it is fairly depressing. It shows how inhumanity is a very human reaction. But, for anyone remotely interested in the Civil war, or how it is protrayed in modern media this movie is a must see.",1127088000,9,808,4.45945945945946
765273,5,6304039115,"The Civil War is the most ironically named of wars, for there was no civility to it. It was a ghastly, vicious, blood feud between countrymen and neighbors where decency was among the first casualties of war. That fact has often been lost in big sweeping dramas about the Civil War where we can focus on the grandeur of great armies in motion and the big concepts of honor and cause. Director Robby Henson forces our attention back to the ugly truth of the war by focusing on a much smaller story. No great armies clash in `Pharaoh's Army'. Instead, we see only a tiny rural community in the bitterly divided boarder state of Kentucky, where neighbors rein terror on each other according to their allegiances, and where a small group of Yankee soldiers comes foraging; stealing chickens instead of fighting Rebels.
The film opens with the funeral of a little girl, who is later that night exhumed and hurled without ceremony out of the cemetery; Union neighbors would not have the body of a Secesh's child resting with their kin. A later scene shows an old farmer and his wife who were murdered and thrown into their well as their house burns for the simple reason that they sent two sons to fight for the Union. Into this bitter savagery rides a small band of Yankee soldiers foraging food from Rebel's farms. They have not yet been in battle, and are more than a little chagrined to be stealing chickens rather than fighting Rebs. An accident to one forces them to hold up at the farm of Sarah Anders (Patricia Clarkson) a Rebel's wife who burns with a barely contained righteous rage against all Yankees, yet has no choice but to submit to their demands to protect herself and her boy. The Yankee captain (Chris Cooper) has not yet learned to hate from the war, and struggles to show as much kindness and decency as he can to these folk he is robbing of their substance. The heart of the film is the tense relationship that develops between the Yankee Captain and Mrs. Anders as they discover occasional moments of shared humanity, but are left starring at each other over the impassable, blood filled gulf of the war, and discover that in war, hate trumps kindness, and there is no decency.
Patricia Clarkson absolutely shines in her role as Sarah Anders. With a mere glance she is able to show the strength, pride, hate, longing, despair and fortitude that holds the fierce Mrs. Anders together. Chris Cooper matches her with his own brilliant and subtle portrayal of Captain Abston, tormented by his own gentleness as he struggles to be a soldier. Kris Kristofferson's cameo as the Preacher provides more ambiance than acting, but is still a nice touch. Shot on location in the hills of Kentucky, the film is as beautiful as its story is tragic.
Robby Henson succeeded admirably with `Pharaoh's Army' in showing  the human cost of the Civil War; not just in lives lost and blood shed,  but in the living's loss of their humanity. This film is a tragic masterpiece, and you should not miss it.

765274,3,6304039115,"PHARAOH'S ARMY has been called the greatest Civil War film ever made. Mmm, I think not, especially when considering such as GLORY, GONE WITH THE WIND, COLD MOUNTAIN, and GETTYSBURG (despite the silly false beards).

Patricia Clarkson is Sarah Anders, a Confederate sympathizer living in 1862 on an isolated hardscrabble farm on Meshack's Creek, Kentucky with her young son (Will Lucas). Sarah's husband is off fighting with the Rebs. Moreover, Sarah recently buried her daughter, only to have the body dug-up and flung aside by Northern sympathizers within hours of the internment. So, Anders has no love for Unionists, and hardly welcomes a 5-man Union Army foraging party led by Captain John Abston (Chris Cooper), which appears one day at her homestead to steal the chickens, bacon, and a cow to feed their comrades back in camp. Unfortunately, the soldiers' departure is delayed when one of Abston's men, Newt (Huckleberry Fox), tumbles off a rickety ladder and impales himself on a pitchfork, necessitating that he be placed in Sarah's own bed to be medically tended. Anders can only grit her teeth and wait.

PHARAOH'S ARMY is ostensibly based on a true recollection told to folklorist Harry Caudill in 1941 by an aged Kentucky mountaineer, presumably the Anders boy in the twilight of his life. While Clarkson and Cooper do an unimpeachable job portraying two characters striving to remain decent and civil in the most trying of circumstances, the original mountaineer's story is apparently so unembellished that the viewer might wish that the film's scriptwriters had lost their heads for a brief moment and taken some dramatic license. Abston recently lost his wife, and left a young son back on his own farm - one much like Sarah's. So, his resultant attraction to Anders is understandable. At one point, the two appear to be making a human connection that transcends the bitterness of the war, but Sarah's intransigent hatred of Unionists prevails, especially after one of the captain's men misbehaves. The film sputters to an understandable, yet perhaps unremarkable, finish.

The DVD's jacket implies that Kris Kristofferson, as a forbidding, Yankee-hating preacher, plays a major role. Yet, he appears only briefly thrice, and the film's editors might just as well have left him on the cutting room floor for all the impact he had on the plot, which would have been leaner and better had it just concentrated and enlarged on the Abston-Anders relationship.

PHARAOH'S ARMY isn't a bad movie, only unremarkable as an entertainment vehicle. Put another way, I wasn't engaged.",1098144000,10,2587,5.137767220902613
765275,5,6304039115,"I saw this film in 1996 and can still remember every scene.  Since then I've been waiting for it to become available on VHS.  It's a story that compells you to think about the horrors of war and the difficult moral choices both soldiers and civilians in the path of war must frequently face.  Like the film ""All Quiet On The Western Front""  it doesn't force you into taking sides (in this case with the North or South in the American Civil War) but merely makes you ask yourself ""What would I do if I were that character?""  A film can't go much deeper than that.  This film was done on a somewhat low-budget and it relied heavily on an excellent cast, perfect costumes and location, and remarkable direction from Robby Henson.  IT IS BY FAR THE BEST AMERICAN CIVIL WAR FILM YET MADE!
I hope to see much more from Director Robby Henson.  He truly has the potential to become one of middle America's great movie storytellers.",1036108800,40,923,4.4523809523809526
765276,5,6304039115,"""Pharaoh's Army"" defies formula. Instead of selling out for cliches and big stars, it relies completely on the excellent acting from a strong cast, the strength of a well written script, and a fascinating and bitter story. The result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast, with a heavy emotional current. One of the best I've ever seen about the Civil War, and I think it can owe that to the pleasure of being an independent film (if you like this film, try to see the brilliant indie Civil War film ""Wicked Spring"" as well).
""Pharaoh"" simply tells the true story of a small expedition/forage team of Union men who ride into a Confederate farm to take provisions, but end up stuck there because of an accident of one of the men. Tensions broil and relationships are made and broken. Nothing happens the way Hollywood would write it; this movie comes from the mind of someone who actually cares about quality film and the telling of history. Superb dialogue and plot exposition move along a film that looks highly professional, but often doesn't feel like you're watching a movie, more along the lines of hearing a story.
The film boasts an incredible performance from Chris Cooper who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role. He transforms, but is always at the height of believability and is easy to emotionally relate to. Patricia Clarkson is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in. She shares an interesting chemistry with Cooper's character and where she's the more severe of the characters, is still as easy to identify with. The rest of the cast is quite capable, and fill their roles in well.
The art design and the set are wonderful, and personally I love the cinematography. It all has the feel of a Civil War period photograph with the camera presenting strong contrasting colors and shadows and a tin-like metalic tint, but always keeping the naturalistic look of the rustic setting. They seem to have used natural lighting, but whatever they used works beautifully. Everything looks like it belongs where it is, it feels period, something I find rare in American period films. The actors act 19th century, not like 20th century people in old clothes.
Above all, this film is very personal. I think that as an indie it can afford it. The film is nearly flawless with an outstanding script that effortlessly creates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and lets them grow in a situation, as bad as it is. It doesn't fail in getting it's point across, and it gets it's point across without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war films these days. It's brave. It relies on it's characters, a fantastic script, human emotion, and in the cold hard fact that the Civil War wasn't all CGI, big stars, and hoop skirts.",1034726400,88,2846,4.751515151515152
765277,5,6304039115,"Anyone who is interested in the history of the ""Civil War"" ought to watch this movie. It is an honest account of an episode which happened daily during that war: a group of Yankee soldiers arriving at a farm in Kentucky requisitioning food for the Union army. The farmer is absent, fighting for the Confederacy and leaving behind wife and son.
Interesting are the emotions between the Captain and the farmer's wife, between the Captain and his soldiers, and, last but not least, the human aspects which come to the forefront within the course of the movie.
Again, anyone who is into an honest account of what happened and is not into bombastic Hollywood productions would be delighted having this movie.",1028592000,5,703,4.818181818181818
765278,5,6304039115,"This movie is the story of the wife of a Confederate soldier who is alone with her eleven year old son in the Cumberland Mountains of southern Kentucky during THE war.  Basic survival is their daily task.  Five Union soldiers descend upon their home seeking food and supplies.  Due to events beyond anyone's control, the soldiers end up staying for an extended period of time.
The best thing about this movie is that it does not play up to modern stereotypes nor political correctness.  This movie portrays each and every person as unique individuals with hopes, dreams, and quirks all of their own.  As everyone in modern times should try to understand, no matter what group of people under consideration, there have always been good, bad, and indifferent in each and every group.  All Yankees were not arson-rapists like Sherman and some of his soldiers.  All Confederates were not sadistic torcherers who sat up during the midnight hour beating all their slaves within an inch of their life.  People of the past were humans, plain and simple-some were good, some were bad--JUST LIKE TODAY.  This movie brings a portrayal of the past back to reality.
Each character, even though they have flaws of varying degrees as compared to one another, has redeeming qualities and unfulfilled good potentials.
Not only is this a great historical portrayal of an extremely difficult time of hardship, it is a great study of human character.  This movie should get more attention and acclaim.
Wonderful and riveting from the especially moving and emotional opening scene all the way through to the unexpected end.  Buy this, watch it, enjoy it, and remember it for years!  You will not be sorry.",1007683200,23,1684,4.911660777385159
765279,5,6304039115,"Kudos to director Robby Henson for a superlative directorial debut, as well as for his well written screenplay, which is based upon a true story. This is a film in the best indie tradition. It is an absolute gem. Taut and spare, it does more with less. Coupled with the excellent direction and screenplay are award calibre performances by Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson, as well as by the entire supporting cast.
The story takes place during the Civil War in 1862 in the state of Kentucky, which was a state uneasily divided in its loyalties, with some of its citizens favoring the Union and others favoring the Confederacy. The story revolves around the personal dynamics between a Union Captain, played with great sensitivity by Chris Cooper, and a woman, played with restrained bitterness by Patricia Clarkson, whose husband is fighting with the Confederacy.
Captain Abston and four of his men chance upon the home of Sarah Anders, while they are foraging for provisions in Kentucky. They descend upon her and her eleven year old son like locusts, plundering what little she has. Yet, thanks to the Captain, they show restraint. The Captain, a widower with a young son back home in Ohio, is drawn to this spare, bitter woman. When one of his men injures himself while on her property, requiring a period of convalescence before he can be moved, the Captain and Sarah begin a slow dance of unspoken courtship. The viewer sees Sarah awaken to the captain's interest in her by her choice of dress, by her glance in a looking glass. It is beautifully played out in the most subtle of ways, but is simply not to be, as their ideological differences put them squarely in opposing camps.
The subtlety and nuances in this film are finely drawn. It attempts to show the impact of war on people in a most personal way. The tension of war is always there beneath the surface, ready to bubble over, as conflict struggles with humanity. The ordinary tasks of one's daily life become almost poignant under the circumstances. Yet, it is always a question as to whether conflict will triumph over humanity. This film illustrates some of these issues in a very meaningful way. It is a small gem of a film that deals with some very big issues in a way that almost breaks one's heart. Bravo!",1006473600,13,2279,4.714285714285714

If you're looking for a multi-plot, action-packed, film with a cast of thousands, this is not the one for you.  If you can grasp the plot of a Shakespearean play and have the patience, this will work.  There is absolutely nothing bad about the acting.  All of the actors did very well considering the plot they had to work with.  Period clothing and weapons are correct, down to the last detail.  What little action that is included is an after-the-fact matter.  For example, in one ""action"" scene, the Yankees hear gunshots far off, go to investigate, find a smouldering burned-out farm cabin, with no one around the place.  Any bodies they found had been tossed down a nearby well, with the camera focusing only upon their horrified facial expressions.  Kris Kristofferson fans will be disappointed, as he has only a minor role in the film with three short appearances.  I really was expecting to see more Confederate farmers with guns then the only one sent by Kristofferson to drive off the Union soldiers.

The conflicts between a small band of Union soldiers and a southern woman and her son had me sympathizing first with one, and then the other. And then back again.

765721,5,6304039115,"This movie takes place deep in the hills of 1862 Kentucky somewhere near the Cumberland Gap. While her husband is off fighting in the Confederate Army, a farm woman and her 11-year old boy face bitterness when their Yankee neighbors down the way uncover the grave of the woman's daughter which they had to bury of recently. Shortly after relocating the grave to their own land, a foraging detail of 5 Union soldiers led by a Yankee captain played by Chris Cooper, come across their farm for supplies from the farms of enemy contraband. They're just about on their way when one of the Yankees hurts himself by falling on something sharp in the barn.
One of the reviews says that while the soldier is too hurt to be moved and has to recover, the Yankee officer and the farm woman kind of have a ""courtship"" going on. I just finished the movie 5 minutes ago and would have to disagree with that, seeing as the scenes are still fresh in my mind. It seems more like what the woman and the officer share is sort of an uneasy truce between each other. The captain is there because his orders are to send any found supplies down to the waiting hungry Yankee troops over in the Cumberland Gap, and the woman knows that his men have been trying to rob them blind, despite her best efforts to hide her food supplies however she can. So when the captain feels like he can offer the boy some tips on how to plant a corn crop, seeing as he has a farm of his own, the woman even suggests the idea of if he can really make them feel better after trying to rob them by making everything okay. He comforts her when she's at the grave of her daughter, but that is all I've seen of their ""courtship.""

The uneasy truce falls apart when the family dog takes a bit of the food that the Yankees have stolen and are cooking over a fire. One of the soldiers is pissed about that and makes a move to harm the dog. When the woman protests this, he tells her to ""Go to hell."" She throws a bucket at his back in retaliation and he tries to assault her, but the captain intervenes, just to have the soldier say sarcastically to him, ""I hope you get a piece."" That leads to another struggle and instead of looking grateful, the woman exclaims that she hopes they all kill each other.

The Yankee detail just about loses half of their men in the whole thing. One of the soldiers attempts to desert, despite the captain's threats to kill him if he does so. The soldier is killed, but I don't know if the captain pulled the trigger on him or if it came from the lone sniper hiding in the hills which pins down the entire detail for about 20 minutes or so. Once Chris Cooper tracks down the man and kills him, everyone is surprised to see that the sniper was really a Negro, who belonged to a preacher in that community.
The other man that dies is the wounded man. As the Yankee detail finally leaves, they depart with the family mule and even the bed with the wounded man on it. The boy goes after them in pursuit among the hills and the trees with a loaded pistol and kills the wounded Yankee up close, then while the rest of the detail is in complete confusion, he escapes into the hills and back to the farm. The captain goes back to the farm with the dead body and the mule, and even in his anguish, he can't bring himself to kill the woman and the boy, so he fires two shots in the air and leaves, hoping the dead man will at least get a Christian burial.

The best the Yankee soldier can get as a burial is being nudged into a small opening of a crevice left by some tree that partially toppled over. This movie happens to be a true story, as it says in the end that about 60 years later, the narrator of the movie went back to that same knothole where the Yankee was taken to. They may have survived the war, but the father in the Confederate Army certainly doesn't, meeting the same fate as the other 620,000 Americans in that war did.

If you're looking for a movie where there's plenty of battle-action, this certainly isn't the flick for you. But if you want a Civil War movie that describes daily life on the home front, especially on those who owned farms that had to deal with Yankee foraging raiders, this movie is an A-plus.

I am a Civil War buff but usually prefer epic films like, 'Gettysburg', 'Glory', and 'Andersonville'. I watched the film the first time and was very impressed by it and I continue to be more impressed. It is a little film but it has a lot of heart and contains excellent acting. 'Pharaoh's Army' just feels authentic. It really brings the aspect of the Civil War that it chooses to depict to life.

I really enjoyed the acting by Patricia Clarkson and Chris Cooper. They both feel very authentic. There is much good, understated acting by them. The rural farm life is brought back to life as is the fear of your supplies being plundered by an invading army. I think the film excels in this aspect as the acting done by the actors playing Cooper's soldiers and Clarkson's son is first rate. It really brings home that this was a very strange war of American vs American and that the average person on each side seemed to care less about 'The Cause'. Also, I found the character played by Kris Kristofferson to be interesting and very hard to figure out. The hatred of both sides of the war in Kentucky is brought out in a believable fashion.

I really recommend this film as a slice of American history as I think it really is a little treasure.

765786,5,6304039115,"I've had a DVD copy of ""Pharaoh's Army"" in my home collection for several years, and have watched it at least a half-dozen times, each time thoroughly enjoying this little-known, Indie film that escaped my attention when it was first released in 1995. First-time writer/director Robbie Benson deserves a lot of credit for this beautifully crafted, realistic, and subtly moving film about a slice of just a few days in 1862 during the Civil War, and a small group of foraging Union soldiers, whose lives briefly and tragically intersect with a woman and her 11 year old son on their back-woods Kentucky farm. Reportedly based on a true story, this short 90 minute film captures more of the tensions that were behind the American Civil War than scores of other big-battle epics about that singular American conflict. Those looking for massive battle scenes and sweeping panoramas of smoky battlefields should look elsewhere- but if you are a contemplative sort who appreciates fine acting, beautifully framed cinematography scenes, and a subtle and moving musical score, this film will suck you in like few others. Without anything more than several carefully spaced bits of dialogue between the few principal actors, this film speaks volumes for the North-South tensions that resulted in the Civil War, and the enduring impact that conflict has had on the USA to this day.

Sarah Anders (Patricia Clarkson) and her 11 year old son (Will Lucas) are trying to survive on their small Kentucky farm during 1862- her husband off fighting for the South, and their means of existence critically dependent on a few chickens, a cow, and tilling their land for crops to eat. Enter Captain Abston (Chris Cooper) and his small band of 4 Union soldiers, sent to forage food and supplies for the larger Union army campaigning in the area. Needless to say, what they want is what Sarah and her boy need to survive. After one of the Union soldiers is accidentally injured by falling on a pitchfork in her barn, the small squad is forced to stay for several days to allow the soldier to recover from his wound. The 4 supporting actors filling the roles of the Union soldiers (Chicago, Rodie, Newt and Neely) are excellent in their small roles- the sparse dialogue perfectly fits the times, and also speaks volumes about the reasons why ordinary farmers, butchers, and ordinary folks took up arms against each other. The two leads (Cooper and Clarkson) provide a wonderfully understated interaction of North vs: South, a human microcosm of the vast war. Kris Kristofferson has a brief but powerful presence as the local Southern preacher, with a black slave Israel (Mac Miles) who eventually initiates the inevitable violence that shatters the building tensions on the farm. No spoilers here, but the climax of this movie left me very moved, and stuck with me for a long time. The narrator's voice (that of the young boy, spoken in retrospect many years later) is also intersperced perfectly throughout the movie, and compliments the story very well.
The soundtrack is also very understated and subtle, and fits the time and the story in a beautiful way.
Cinematography is A+: the clothes and uniforms are very accurately detailed, and all the actors look their part. And for once, a period movie that also avoids modern slang language, and has the actors use dialogue that would be appropriate for 1862.
I give this movie 5 stars without reservation, but only for the viewer interested in a more contemplative take on what the Civil War was all about. I liken it in many ways to ""Ride With The Devil"", though the latter also clearly is more of an action film.
Civil War buffs will certainly appreciate all the subtle nuances of this film, but it's worth viewing even if you aren't of that ilk.
I just wish it had been a little longer. A real hidden gem.",1231113600,13,3835,4.846036585365853
765787,5,6304039115,"A terrific film about division and hatred.  I agree with a previous reviewer that this absolutely superior film defies comparison.  Nevertheless, the film is somewhat reminiscent of the excellent 'Ride with the Devil', a film about Confederate irregulars in Missouri, and even resembles, in some ways, 'The Last Valley,' with Omar Sharif and Michael Caine.  'The Last Valley' isn't about 'our' Civil war but about the even more devastating 30 years war in Germany.  Mercenaries have discovered a hidden valley in Germany that hasn't been totally 'eaten out' and devastated by war.  The mercenaries, led by Michal Caine as 'The Captain' will correct that quickly.  The local Burgomeister [Omar Shariff] convinces them that their best tactic is to overwinter there taking only what they require.  They do, putting them in prolonged contact with an unhappy civilian population.

In its own way, 'Pharaoh's Army' is an even better film.  Essentially decent men are ordered to do totally indecent things [""I Vas just taking orders""].  Union foragers in the Cumberland region of Kentucky raid Southern sympathizing farms taking everything that their hungry army requires.  Mostly what they want is food.  People...mostly women and children...who are already undergoing deep privation, have Yankee soldiers show up to steal everything that they can...hams, chickens, cattle, hogs, even horses.  Who knows how many of these poor people simply starved to death never making it to the rolls of 'honored dead' during the War?

This is the context of the film.  A young Union forager, while looking for hidden food, falls from a hayloft and is impaled on a farm implement [great material for a modern-day lawsuit, if you think about it].  His four companions, including 'The Captain' are obliged to stay until the soldier dies or recovers enough to be moved.  Therefore the Yankees are obliged to live beside the woman and teenage boy that they have robbed.

'The Captain' is a decent sort and really has no business in a looting/man-killing war.  He says he impetuously volunteered for Union service when his preacher exposed the scarred back of a runaway slave.  On the other hand, he is at heart a farmer and no airyfairy idealist.  He has a small farm, similar to the one he is looting, just over the Ohio River in Southern Ohio.  He soon finds himself plowing a field so that the family will have corn during the Summer.  You get the impression that the Captain would rather stay [his wife died two years previously] rather than continuing to 'Save the Union.'  It isn't to be and the story devolves into bloodshed and hatred.

One of the best things about the film is that it deeply explores the underlying issues of Civil War.  There is a young Union soldier, recently from Germany.  ""Why did you join?"" he is asked.  ""Because I was tired of making sausage.""  His motives go no deeper than that but, unlike many others he has thought about it.  "" There's not one Union soldier who would give up his precious life to free a bunch of...blacks,"" he says.  Here is the truth.  Anti-slavery/pro-slavery rhetoric was for the elites--those who didn't have to fight and die.  The soldiers, north and south, were fighting for Union/Secession, because they were drafted or because they couldn't stand the moral pressure at home. ""A rich man's War; A poor man's fight"", was the bitter cry.

Watch the movie, you'll be glad you did.  It may be especially pertinent at this particular time when again the whiff of disunion is in the air.

Food means life or death during times of crisis.  It takes that particular topic and explores it within a dramatic film setting.

I was really disappointed that Kris Kristofferson played such a low involvement part in a plot that failed to captivate me.

As a UK Civil War re-enactor I suppose I can respect those who viewed the film about man's inhumanity to man (stealing another man's family's food, whilst he's away fighting for the other side) without too much killing being depicted.

Unfortunately, I'd much prefer to re-watch Gettysburg, Gods & Generals, Glory etc, which to me are films about the sharp end of the war i.e. the battlefield and the hardship that those fighting in them had to endure, and some of the lunatic decisions made by those that sent them to their sometimes predicatable fate.",1200787200,4,965,4.670588235294118

765792,5,6304039115,"Let's face it, there aren't that many great Civil War films out there. ""Glory,"" ""The Horse Soldiers"" and ""Ride With the Devil"" are the only ones I recall off hand; ""The Blue and the Gray"" and ""Cold Mountain"" also have numerous good points. ""Gettysburg,"" on the other hand, is a bloated, melodramatic, artificial bore (made exclusively for Civil War buffs, whatever that is); I've never seen its prequel.

The peculiarly-titled ""Pharaoh's Army"" is a 1995 indie film about a real-life incident that took place in Kentucky during the Civil War. Because Kentucky was a border state the allegiances of its people were split between North & South. I'm sure it was hard to be neutral.

THE PLOT: A Union captain (Chris Cooper) and four soldiers invade a young widow's farm in the Kentucky wilderness (the widow is played by Patricia Clarkson); since her husband fought and died for the Confederacy they supposedly have the right to her livestock, even though she argues that she and her boy will likely starve come winter. One of the soldiers is accidently wounded and they are forced to stay for a few days. The captain attempts to be a gentleman and even helps out on the small farm, but he fails to win any kind of favor with the widow, who rightly views them as nothing more than invading enemies. Events turn deadly and the captain, even though a good-hearted gentleman, is forced into an intense position.

Although the story is based on real events and takes place during the Civil War, this is not an epic war film with big battle scenes, strategizing generals, etc. The entire film takes place in and around the widow's small farm and focuses soley on the events that take place there. This limited scope may turn some viewers off.

Even though this is a small indie film, the score, cast, acting and writing are all top notch. The story is fairly slow-paced and there are no cataclysmic events to arouse those with ADD. The first time I saw it, I thought it was good, but not great. I viewed it again about a year later (earlier this summer) and liked it even more. Lately images of this picture have popped into my mind and something occurred to me: The way the film plays out and is presented to the viewer is REAL LIFE. What I mean is that it's almost as if someone went back in time and actually filmed the actual events. This is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. I tire of all the silly hollywoodisms common in modern American cinema -- supposedly humorous one-liners, unrealistic action scenes, excessive explosions, melodrama, unconvincing dialogue, etc.

The ending is powerful as the captain, a good man, is thrust into a position of cold-blooded murder in the name of war. It's intense, and so REAL. The insanity of war can easily turn the best of us into heartless killers.

The cover of the DVD prominently features Kris Kristofferson, but his role as a pro-South Kentucky preacher is relatively minor.

FYI: ""Pharaoh's Army"" was acually filmed in Kentucky, no doubt near where the real events took place.

BOTTOM LINE: This is a small film about a minor peripheral incident during the Civil War. It's not a big league Hollywood picture with the corresponding melodramtic, pretentiousness like, say, ""Saving Private Ryan"" (although that film has some undeniable positive qualities, like the D-Day invasion, there are way too many forced, artificial moments and dialogue -- remember the moronic dog tag scene?). ""Pharaoh's Army"" is generally a quiet film and likely won't blow you away or anything. What it has in its favor, however, is unpretentious REALISM. It's refreshing; and it will stay with you.",1189209600,5,3621,4.7824
765793,4,6304039115,"I agree with all the kudos viewers have accorded this film. It's shockingly honest and even ""politically incorrect"" -- something almost unheard of in moviedom.

Whether anybody involved in the production meant it that way, Pharoah's Army (PA) is strongly pro-South in its viewpoint. It is in fact a microcosm of the ugly issues the war was really about. The North had plenty of problems (and plenty of SLAVES) and no to need moralize at anybody else, much less to straighten another country out with guns and bombs and torches. In the remoteness and quiet of a barn, the bluecoats sort out the Union army's patently feckless motivations, but in the end they're loyal to the federal juggernaut against all human impulses.

The Southerners (Sarah Anders and her son) aren't perfect, but are emblematic of the real South -- grossly put upon and violated. I simply cannot believe the story can still be told with such honesty in a dramatic production. For once, movie brutality has a purpose -- illuminating real-life brutality.

The cast of PA understands all this on some level, whether or not they'd  consciously agree with it. And they live the war all over again through this story, more meaningfully that I can remember it having seen it before on film (not even in Birth of a Nation or Gone With the Wind). The acting is near-perfect (even at its most stone-faced) and gets better with each viewing. You feel like you've known every character in real life somewhere before.

Normally I wouldn't recommend a movie with even mild vulgarities in it, but here again there's a point: showing up character. It's OK with me if nobody under 13 (maybe 16?) sees PA -- and responsible parents will explain all this to any kids they allow to see it.

My only real complaint is that you can't understand the dialogue at times. Anybody else? Also that a scene in which Anders and the captain hold hands over an ailing Yankee soldier (to weepy background music) strains credibility.

After facing the brutality of unionists in her county, mother and son hope to stay put on their modest farm stuck tightly between mountains and creek. A foraging party made up of 5 union soldiers from the gap arrive and the mother attempts to hide her livestock and food. The captain, played by Chris Cooper, while regretting his duty to take foodstuffs, is taken back by the farm, reminding him of his place and family back home. Due to an unfortunate accident to one of his men, the small platoon overstays it's welcome. The film captures the loneliness of the spirit in time of war as the mother does not know if her husband is alive or dead, nor does the captain know when he will return north to his farm. The innocence of the soldiers is captured very well as some are recent immigrants struggling to do their duty while it is apparent that most are of them are not professional soldiers, still raw recruits. The mother, played by Patricia Clarkson, guards the burial site of her daughter passionately and for a moment the captain and the mother find an almost spiriturtal bond,  both having lost something important in their life. Everything looks to be vintage 1864, the uniforms and materials all look like they are appropriate for the period. Reality steps in place as time for the soldiers seems to have a sense of foreboding. Worried about being captured by partisan rangers, they suddenly become the hunted in this shattering of a seemingly truce between the two parties. As violence enters the scene both parties revert to their respective sides of anger and frustration. The movie is very realistic with a tragic ending that could be more severe if not for the last minute use of rational thought. Kristofferson has a modest but convincing role as a revenge minded southern preacher. The scenery and materials are so rustically real, you have the impression that the farm's flatland is squeezed tightly by a mountain range in Kentucky or somewhere in Appalachia.

7859669,5,6304039115,"Interesting story and Chris Cooper does an excellent job as the lead character.  His emotions between empathy and anger towards the confederate woman is compelling.  For those who expect Kris Kristofferson to be featured as a main character in this movie as the cover leads you to believe, he is not.  He has only a very small (almost miniscule) but pivotal part.  I was interested to notice that Kris' daughter Tracy Kristofferson was one of the producers of this film.  Very good story and very good film that I would recommend.  It is set during the civil war but no epic battles only the human ones.  So do not be deterred thinking it is going to be bloody and gory, as there is shooting but I would not call a blood bath.  There are no war scenes.",1470182400,,752,4.437956204379562
7859670,5,6304039115,"A small but very well made film full of excellent veteran actors. The attention to period detail is good as is character development.

During the US Civil War a woman with southern sympathies alone with her child in the back woods is confronted by some northern military foragers. The film concentrates on their interactions involving hostility, self-questioning and some mutual understanding.

I like these small well made indie type films so gave it high marks.",1465776000,,463,5.16
7859671,5,6304039115,"The tale of a small event in the War of the Rebellion that is well presented.  While the event was not of any significance in the was, the tale shows how the nation was torn apart on a personal level.  Well done....and closed captioned for the hearing impaired.",1465689600,,261,4.416666666666667
7859672,5,6304039115,This movie just feels so authentic.  I can imagine such things happening and the sadness that would haunt you for the rest of your life.  This is what the Civil War was like emotionally I am sure.,1463184000,,196,4.27027027027027
