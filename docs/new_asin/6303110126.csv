7838194,5,6303110126,"This is the first fitness video I ever bought and I'm so glad that I did.  Not only does it give you an incredible workout, you learn cool dance moves.  Pepper kinda gets on my nerves because it seems like he doesn't know what he's doing sometimes, but the rest of them are good.  Donna's segment rocks, but I loved Joel's the best.  Must be something about the Charleston--I love learning to dance.  It is true that the quality isn't the best, but who cares!!  Just go with it and have fun!",1010880000,6,491,4.282608695652174
