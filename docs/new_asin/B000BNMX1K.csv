3537587,5,B000BNMX1K,"Justin Chang's review in Variety suggests the movie might have been titled East-Meets-West Side Story.  Yes, it takes only a few minutes into the movie to recognize the Sharks and Jets..  I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but wanted to see Derek Hough's dancing (always impressive).  Then I saw to my surprise that the choreography was by two of my favorite choreographers,  Napoleon and Tabitha Dumo.  The dance numbers in this movie live up to their reputations and to Hough's.  Hough learned tap just for the move (in two months) and as far as I can tell did a very credible job.  The taiko drum and dance crew, COBU, is very entertaining. I would have like to have seen more of them.  Bottom line: this is a dance movie, not a dramatic tour do force.  If you are a SYTYCD or dance crew fan, you should find the movie quite enjoyable.",1406505600,11,844,4.5
3537588,1,B000BNMX1K,"Mismatched romantic lead actors, garage sale wardrobes of leads, shallow and wooden emoting by leads, especially Derek Hough, superficially scripted and almost humorous, but not meant to be, relationships between friends and enemies, and  energetic but uninspiring and mixed up dance choreography - eastern Japanese drum and jumping routines paired with Hough's western hoofing -made me want to make a move away from this viewing.",1406419200,2,430,5.615384615384615
3537589,5,B000BNMX1K,"I enjoy watching this often.  Love Derek Hough in this move hope he does more movies, as an actor and or choreographer.",1406332800,7,119,4.409090909090909
3537590,5,B000BNMX1K,OMG that was an amazing movie and Derek can act!!!!!!,1406246400,7,53,4.4
3537591,5,B000BNMX1K,"I watched this movie in the theater while vacationing for a week in Arizona. LOVED IT SO MUCH that I watched it again before leaving! I couldn't wait to pre-order the DVD, and it arrived right on time. I eagerly sat down to watch it. I have watched the movie several more times now since it arrived.

The dancing in this movie is beyond fantastic. It's A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. The combination of tap, hip hop and taiko drumming, called COBU, is so novel, I found myself begging for more. I also found myself engrossed by the story line between ""Donny"", played by handsome and multi-talented Derek Hough of Dancing With the Stars, and ""Aya"", played by beautiful BoA Kwon, the Korean Queen of Pop.

The DVD is a must have, just for the bonus features alone. The DVD included deleted scenes, some of which I can't understand why they were deleted. They would have added significantly to the story line. The Bonus section also showed scenes from the making of the movie, concentrating on how Derek Hough learned to tap dance in just three months for this movie (kudos to him), and on his dance relationship with his co-star BoA. Prior to this movie, I had never heard of her. She's a singer, but what a dance talent she is!

Overall, I highly recommend this movie. Duane Adler, the screenwriter and director, outdid himself in this flick. Loved it more than his other Step Up movies. Too bad this movie was not promoted properly. It was an independent film with a limited release. Should have been shown all over, in my opinion.",1406160000,22,1515,4.603703703703704
3537592,5,B000BNMX1K,"I am so disappointed I didn't get to see this on the big screen. It wasn't shown in my state. :/ I got my DVD about 9 hours ago and I've already watched it twice. I LOVE IT!!! As a former competition tap dancer I am very impressed with how quick Derek picked up tap dancing. I've been waiting for someone to do a dancing movie with tap in it and this was awesome and bonus!, my favorite professional dancer is the leading man! Woo! I thought his acting was great. He has some really funny, sassy lines that crack me up. Love, love, love it!!!",1405987200,7,542,4.122641509433962

3537600,5,B000BNMX1K,Good chick flick. No cheesy singing. Which is a bit bittersweet personally. So guys can stomach it.  All though it did still have a couple of cheesy tap dance spots. Boa's hip hop dance moves are the best. Another Romeo and juliet type movie with a happy ending. So nothing to original it's just a feel good chick flick.  Very light on comedy also.,1480809600,,348,4.421875
3537601,4,B000BNMX1K,"I'm a big fan of BoA, and would have loved to see her show her singing talent; but the movie is about dancing and I really enjoyed the different dancing styles both solo and as a couple.  The music covers a wide spectrum and fits really well in supporting the dance numbers as well as the story line.  I highly recommend this movie for a date night.",1475193600,,349,4.1940298507462686

It gets the job done and it really entertained me. The rest of the cast is wonderful too. They each have a part to paly and they paly them. If you are expected Academy Award caliber...not here.

I am blown away by the storyline and choreography by Napolean and Tabitha D'umo in this film. While dancing, Derek Hough has an incredible beyond belief talent in every move he makes and his acting in his first major motion picture is suburb.  Kudos to writer and director Duane Adler.  I had never heard of Korean pop superstar BoA before this movie but she is fantastic.  There is a natural chemistry between BoA and Derek Hough. If only this independent film had gotten the proper promotion it deserved from its company.  Midstream, the company was sold to another and they chose not to put much energy into its promotion which is such a shame because so many are truly deprived of a fantastic West Side Story meets Romeo and Juliet dance genre movie.",1408838400,,885,4.758169934640523

3537685,1,B000BNMX1K,"I watch dance movies all the time and do not have high expectations for acting or plot. I only watch to see some good dancing. I felt like the dancing was minimal in the movie, only showing dance routines every once and a while.  And I have to say I was only really entertained by a few of the routines.
But it was hard to even enjoy that because the acting was so so sooooo bad!!! A dance movies should have a little acting and a lot of dancing and you will have a good movie since a lot of dancers are not great actors. These were not Step Up (1) quality actors and they were trying too hard to force the plot.  Too many acting scenes with horrific acting + not enough entertaining dance = an awful movie. One of the worst dance movies ever in my opinion.",1407542400,2,757,4.073825503355705

It's one and only redeeming quality was the drumming....very cool! The acting was super weak all around,which I can totally l tolerate for some wicked dancing. Super disappointing.....don't waste your time!!",1407456000,3,381,5.161290322580645

8294670,2,B000BNMX1K,"I'm old, so you'd think that I'd like tap, but I really prefer the dancing in Step up with Channing Tatum.
Derek Hough is a good dancer, but only a so-so actor & the dancing that was most interesting was when he was dancing with Lee & there wasn't much of that. The girls on the drums were ok, but not riveting.
There isn't much plot so you'd think that they'd stuff the movie full of dancing, but sadly there are only a few interesting dance numbers, those with Hough & Lee.
The rest of the movie is grade C",1494115200,,508,4.09
