7998347,5,B0000CABFE,"I want to let everyone seeing this know that this DVD is one of the ""Anime Test Drive"" DVD's that Central Park Media put out some time ago. I have this disc and it is the first 2 episodes of ""Record of Lodoss War"" and around 40 minutes of previews of other period shows. It was an attempt by CPM to sell box sets when they were relatively expensive around 10 years ago.

The image you see is naturally the back cover of the DVD.

This is not a bad show by any means,  but the same DVD is available very cheap elsewhere on Amazon. Search ""anime test drive"" and you will see more choices.

The 2 eps are IMO very good but are dated and consist of more than usual panning of stills, etc., but having said this, it still stands as one of the pillars of anime history.

I especially like the opening theme by Sakamoto Maaya; she has a wonderful voice and is still singing new songs today! (for instance, the opening of ""And Yet the Town Moves"", a wonderful series).

Thanks and your comments are welcome.",1378252800,,999,4.231578947368421
7998348,5,B0000CABFE,"These are a great way to watch the first episode or two of a series and the record of lodoss wars, are always amazing. Sadly the discount is expired now and if you are going to buy this disc you may as well pay the rest and buy the whole first volume or the show. Highly reccammend the show but without the 10 dollar rebate, WHICH IS EXPIRED BY OVER 5 YEARS, the disc is not wort it unless you are unfamiliar with the record of lodoss war shows. if you can get it for a dollar or two it's worth while however if you pay more than 6 dollars total you could have bought the first volume cheaper.",1314748800,,593,3.991596638655462
