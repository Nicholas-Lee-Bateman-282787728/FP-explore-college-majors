8120228,5,B000FBHCGE,"I am giving the DVD 5 stars for subject matter, the gloriously opulent galerie d'Apollon.  It is currently my newest art fixation, and I just don't feel it is given it's due in the pantheon of art wonders.  Something akin to an 80/20 rule seems to dictate which art subjects get exposure, where a large disproportionate amount of media is focused on a very small number of artists and their work, so I feel that efforts like this are well deserving of recognition.  The English language audio is overdubbed alongside the French as one reviewer noted, but it's a fairly common practice for documentaries.  My only complaint is that I felt a little too much attention was paid to Delacroix, largely because I beg to differ that his style was well suited for the gallery.  There are alot of extra features that focus on restoration and conservation.  A book was published commemorating the gallery and it's restoration; the English language version is ISBN 2070117995.",1199491200,,965,4.853658536585366
8120229,4,B000FBHCGE,"This is an elegant 80 minute film made in 2004 whose sole subject is the history and three year restoration completed in 2004 of the Apollo Gallery in the Louvre. The sumptuously decorated gallery in the heart of the French capital is perhaps most famous for its mid-19th century Delacroix ceiling paintings but its architectural and decorative history begins two centuries earlier with Louis XIV.

Like the great French cathedrals the Apollo Gallery took almost 200 years to complete - it was begun in 1661 under the direction of architect Le Vau and painter Charles Le Brun. The approximate 1800 square foot gallery with 45 foot high ceiling is decorated with an Italian-inspired program of allegorical painting and sculpture accompanied by a feast of golden filigree.

The DVD presents the film by Jerome Prieur in its original French language (without English subtitles!) as well an English version which presents the same French version with over-narration in English. While I cannot guess what may irritate another viewer, I have viewed the film in its English format with satisfaction but it is the original French language version that brings the highest order of satisfaction to the viewer who understands French or enjoys hearing it.

The film attempts to be comprehensive of its subject - we learn its history, iconography, the personalities involved in its creation and the activity of the team who patiently clean and restore the art work which cost about 7 million US dollars. While the film is both a visual and aural experience of the gallery under restoration conditions, it is the beauty of the art as well as its compelling historical creation which is the focus of the film.

Scholars providing ""talking head"" commentary are mostly French or French-speaking although there is one Englishman and one German - all of them apparently filmed inside the echoing gallery during restoration work. This panoply of expert observers include Genevieve Brec of the Musee du Louvre; Peter Burke; Gerard Mace and Philippe Beaussant, both writers; Alain Merot, Universite de Paris - Sorbonne; Michel Goutal, Architecte en chef des Monuments Historiques; among others.

Several panoramic gallery shots including slow moving close-ups of the painting, sculpture and other decorative art works orient the viewer to the interior space, while references to its Paris setting are scanty. Nonetheless, there are nice modern shots of Paris from the Louvre rooftops at morning and night as well as shots of period canvases of the exterior of the Apollo Gallery.

Each of the scholars is passionate. No American scholars are featured. There is one American voice heard toward the end of the film - a male of supposed college age - who the French filmmaker allows about 15 seconds to opine. It is almost enlightening under such constraints.",1190592000,,2834,5.136659436008677
8120230,1,B000FBHCGE,"This may be a good work for Francophiles.  Also, people who loved visiting the Louvre may treasure it.  However, this work was too boring and linguistically advanced for a high school French class.  Though the interviewees seem to be speaking in a chronological order, I also think this would bore high school history classes.

The menu asks if you want to hear the discussion in French or English. Because it seemed not to offer the French language with English subtitles, I chose English.  Instead of dubbing everything into English, a translator comes on when the experts are speaking in French.  This happens in many non-fictional programs for short interviews.  However, this became irksome for an entire work.  Imagine hearing an American speaking English loudly and a French person whispering in French simultaneously for 90 minutes.  It's that kind of annoying.  Since the French original quotes start before and end after the translation, I suspect some words or sentences were edited.

Most documentaries have 5 interviewees at most.  This had much, much more.  There was one woman and one English speaker.  There was an Asian expert speaking in French.  Americans who don't know that there are French nationals of East Asian descent may be surprised by this.

This is simply not a winning program and I am confident that there are better alternatives out there.",1174867200,,1372,5.058035714285714
