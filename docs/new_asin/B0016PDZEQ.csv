3162657,5,B0016PDZEQ,I bought this item used and it was in excellent condition. There were no wears or tears on it and the film itself was just excellent. Bravo to this seller and Bravo to the History Channel.,1309910400,6,188,4.25
3162658,3,B0016PDZEQ,"I thought that The History Channel would have done a great job in reviewing Dr. King's life, but I was quite disappointed.  It is my belief, after watching the ""Citizen King"" and ""Freedom Riders"" DVDs that this one has quite a few inaccuracies and doesn't do justice to telling a well-rounded story about Dr. King.  The man was not a saint - he one man doing extraordinary things.  There is no reason to excuse his human flaws any more than there is a reason not to acknowledge his accomplishments.  If I choose only one DVD to watch about King it would, hands down, be ""Citizen King.""  It is a much better, more balanced, historically accurate review of Dr. King's life and contributions.",1309737600,30,689,4.614754098360656

8263862,5,B0016PDZEQ,"Amazing documentary. It is really well edited for a great way of presenting the story through music and insight from the commentators. I used this for several years in my classroom as part of Black History Month, showing short segments over the course of a couple of weeks. The students also rated it as one of their favorite audiovisuals. They felt that the storytelling really made it feel ""real"" and helped understand the story of Dr. King's side in the Civil Rights Movement. There were many times when students cried while watching, both from sad moments and from exciting ones that just moved them.",1424908800,2,604,4.8173076923076925
