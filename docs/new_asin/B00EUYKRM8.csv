5944864,5,B00EUYKRM8,"As a western film collector , i thought the deal was excellent.  The quality is very good and i have to admit it is fun to see some of the young actors that pop into the show.

A side from the gum commercials its all good.  Don;t expect heavy plots and intrigue or any sense of continuity for that matter. Just watch and have fun.

 Now if only someone can take notes and make  a complete quality set of  Roy Rogers and Lone Ranger  shows on dvd",1411516800,8,445,4.0344827586206895

5944867,5,B00EUYKRM8,"The Gene Autry Show is a time machine back to when the good guys always won.  Simple plots to pass away a day.  Honesty, morals, virtue, justice and purpose are a staple of this show.  Familiar faces if you grew up in the 50s, 60s or 70s. The shows all seemed to be filmed in the Southwest and the scenery (albeit in black and white) is spectacular.  Don't expect anything in the way of cliffhangers or riveting plots.  Its just an old time, one half hour show, basic take on what the world should be like or maybe was like once.  Great product for a fair price.",1392595200,11,562,4.205607476635514

5944874,5,B00EUYKRM8,Having watched the Gene Autry show in syndication I was excited to pick this boxed set up!  Gene was a great role model to an impressionable boy who loved cowboy heroes. While this set has a few flaws and shows its age slightly it's still terrific!  Getting older I try and buy films with closed captions as much as possible and this set doesn't have any.  That being said the sound is very clear and I've had no problems listening to it.  I would recommend this set to all those who wish for good wholesome simpler times.  So saddle up partner and join Gene Autry and Champion for some great entertainment!,1421366400,4,607,4.4324324324324325

8609662,1,B00EUYKRM8,"I purchased this box set and found 1 episodes of the first season and 2 episodes of the second season did not play all the way through. I asked for a replacement. After getting the replacement I found the same problem. Some episodes would not play all the way through. I complained again.
After getting the second replacement I again found the same problem. It is obvious that the master that these discs were made from had a problem. The very same episodes did not play properly.
I will not purchase DVD's again that came from Timeless Media group.",1498435200,,549,4.555555555555555
