2996252,5,B000X1KWS6,"Who can forget the incomparable Peter Falk?  Whether he was playing the rumpled trench-coated seemingly bumbling Lt. Colombo or a sleazy tough guy or as in this movie an ""Angel"", his acting repertoire seemed to know no bounds.  The loss of one eye didn't seem to deter him but rather seemed to add character to his persona especially with age.  In this movie, which was made near the end of his career, along with the two others that formed a trilogy of sorts with his character ""Max"" being the tie in to all three, Falk gives a sometimes moving, sometimes comedic performance playing all sorts of characters that entertwines and directly affects the main player's stories.  These three films can be watched and enjoyed by the entire family.  There is no nudity, profanity or humping/bumping in any of them.  Recommend all three, A Town Without Christmas, Finding John Christmas and When Angels Come To Town.  All have recently become available for pre-order here on amazon.  Enjoy.",1418169600,7,982,4.873493975903615

2996257,5,B000X1KWS6,Fantastic movie.  I've been praying for this to come out on DVD since I first saw it on Hallmark Channel.  Peter Falk was outstanding in his role as the Angel named MAX.  So good that He was brought back to make two sequels to this movie.  This movie can dampen your eyes so keep a box of tissues handy.  Before the movie is over it will have your heart jumping with the joy of Chrsitmas.,1389139200,,388,4.12

2996271,4,B000X1KWS6,"Take a jaded journalist. Dispatch her to cover a sentimental story in a small town. Make this be during the holidays. Then shake or stir or whatever. You know a community is out of sorts when it has to cancel its annual Christmas pageant not once, but twice. In 2001's A Town Without Christmas, in embattled Seacliff, Washington, the 102nd Annual Seacliff Christmas Pageant won't be taking place. And in Seacliff a little boy named Chris writes a very grim letter to Santa, the contents of which catapult the entirety of Washington into tumult.

In Seattle, M.J. Jansen (Patricia Heaton) - television news reporter at KRT-TV and a heck of a hardened soul - chafes at being assigned to cover the Chris story. She's not down with the touchy-feely human interest stuff. She'd rather keep on exposing the gun issues in Seattle. She deploys to Seacliff, but under protest. What are the odds that, once arrived, she'll say something snarky like ""This place is super-Christmasy.""?

David Reynolds (Rick Roberts) aspires to be a children's author but right now is making ends meet by writing greeting cards. Oh, wait, he just got sacked. But not before receiving a mysterious package of anonymous original artwork. In tracking down the source of the artwork, David ends up in Seacliff and ends up tangled in M.J.'s assignment.

In Seacliff, where the media has swooped in, ""Operation Rescue Chris"" is in full swing; it's galvanized the community. But no one can find Chris. The letter, adorned with crude crayon angels, informs that the kid lives somewhere in the woods. Time is running out. Chris has promised some dire stuff to Santa.

I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. But I'm a corny chump and it's the holidays. And it's a well-executed movie. It's nice to see Patricia Heaton branching out of her role as the wry and level-headed wife from Everybody Loves Raymond. There are fantasy elements at play that are nicely worked into the narrative. There are diverse plot threads that, by the end of the movie, seamlessly weave together. Much about the story is predictable, but I like the reveal in the Chris storyline. Peter Falk is that mysterious guy who seems to pop up everywhere. Ernie Hudson offers up solid support as the TV news producer not shy of cracking that whip in service of nailing that hot button story. And this may be the best I'd seen of perennial television actor, Rick Roberts.

If you're reduced to a sentimental sap around December, then A Town Without Christmas is just another must-see family viewing. And if, for whatever reason, you're a fan of dying fishing industries - of which Seacliff is one - then this checks off that box, too. Essentially, here's the throughline: Save the child, save a marriage, save the salmon, save a little town, soften a reporter's heart, achieve a writer's dream.",1387152000,4,2835,4.801229508196721
2996272,5,B000X1KWS6,"Part of the ""Angel Max"" (with Peter Falk) series.  I watch this many, many times during the holidays.  ""Finding John Christmas"" is also part of this series.  Be sure to add these to your Christmas viewing.  I'm hoping ""When Angels Come to Town"" will be released. I've been watching these around the TV logos.  It's a treat.

2996276,5,B000X1KWS6,"""A Town Without Christmas"" is definitely among the best movies I have ever seen.

2996278,5,B000X1KWS6,"Here we go again--a terrific Yuletide movie that for some reason is only available on a Region 2 dvd.  I am very fortunate in that I have purchased a regionless dvd player (as mentioned in a number of my other reviews, prices are very reasonable now and they are as simple to set up as regular region 1 players so why everyone doesn't have one is beyond me).  This movie is an excellent example of why everyone should have one--it was shown on Lifetime years ago and as far as I know, has never been released on a Region 1 dvd.  It is also rarely shown on American television anymore (again a mystery), but there are actually three of these Christmas movies featuring Peter Falk as ""Max"", the-angel-who-might-be-Santa-Claus, all of which are terrific and none in a Region 1 dvd.  I was able to locate ""Finding John Christmas"" this year, which I think is not quite as good as this one, but this story of renewed belief in Christmas and a town rescued from imminent destruction is family friendly and very uplifting.  Patricia Heaton and Rick Roberts are both quite good as the leads, and the smaller roles are filled with stellar character actors.  And then, of course, we have the redoubtable Mr. Falk in one of my all time favorite roles for him, kind of goofy and just plain wonderful.",1352937600,,1287,4.54978354978355

3230749,5,B000X1KWS6,"Who can forget the incomparable Peter Falk?  Whether he was playing the rumpled trench-coated seemingly bumbling Lt. Colombo or a sleazy tough guy or as in this movie an ""Angel"", his acting repertoire seemed to know no bounds.  The loss of one eye didn't seem to deter him but rather seemed to add character to his persona especially with age.  In this movie, which was made near the end of his career, along with the two others that formed a trilogy of sorts with his character ""Max"" being the tie in to all three, Falk gives a sometimes moving, sometimes comedic performance playing all sorts of characters that entertwines and directly affects the main player's stories.  These three films can be watched and enjoyed by the entire family.  There is no nudity, profanity or humping/bumping in any of them.  Recommend all three, A Town Without Christmas, Finding John Christmas and When Angels Come To Town.  All have recently become available for pre-order here on amazon.

3230754,5,B000X1KWS6,Fantastic movie.  I've been praying for this to come out on DVD since I first saw it on Hallmark Channel.  Peter Falk was outstanding in his role as the Angel named MAX.  So good that He was brought back to make two sequels to this movie.  This movie can dampen your eyes so keep a box of tissues handy.

3230768,4,B000X1KWS6,"Take a jaded journalist. Dispatch her to cover a sentimental story in a small town. Make this be during the holidays. Then shake or stir or whatever. You know a community is out of sorts when it has to cancel its annual Christmas pageant not once, but twice. In 2001's A Town Without Christmas, in embattled Seacliff, Washington, the 102nd Annual Seacliff Christmas Pageant won't be taking place. And in Seacliff a little boy named Chris writes a very grim letter to Santa, the contents of which catapult the entirety of Washington into tumult.

In Seattle, M.J. Jansen (Patricia Heaton) - television news reporter at KRT-TV and a heck of a hardened soul - chafes at being assigned to cover the Chris story. She's not down with the touchy-feely human interest stuff. She'd rather keep on exposing the gun issues in Seattle. She deploys to Seacliff, but under protest. What are the odds that, once arrived, she'll say something snarky like ""This place is super-Christmasy.""?

David Reynolds (Rick Roberts) aspires to be a children's author but right now is making ends meet by writing greeting cards. Oh, wait, he just got sacked. But not before receiving a mysterious package of anonymous original artwork. In tracking down the source of the artwork, David ends up in Seacliff and ends up tangled in M.J.'s assignment.

In Seacliff, where the media has swooped in, ""Operation Rescue Chris"" is in full swing; it's galvanized the community. But no one can find Chris. The letter, adorned with crude crayon angels, informs that the kid lives somewhere in the woods. Time is running out. Chris has promised some dire stuff to Santa.

I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. But I'm a corny chump and it's the holidays. And it's a well-executed movie. It's nice to see Patricia Heaton branching out of her role as the wry and level-headed wife from Everybody Loves Raymond. There are fantasy elements at play that are nicely worked into the narrative. There are diverse plot threads that, by the end of the movie, seamlessly weave together. Much about the story is predictable, but I like the reveal in the Chris storyline. Peter Falk is that mysterious guy who seems to pop up everywhere. Ernie Hudson offers up solid support as the TV news producer not shy of cracking that whip in service of nailing that hot button story. And this may be the best I'd seen of perennial television actor, Rick Roberts.

If you're reduced to a sentimental sap around December, then A Town Without Christmas is just another must-see family viewing. And if, for whatever reason, you're a fan of dying fishing industries - of which Seacliff is one - then this checks off that box, too. Essentially, here's the throughline: Save the child, save a marriage, save the salmon, save a little town, soften a reporter's heart, achieve a writer's dream.",1387152000,4,2835,4.801229508196721
3230769,5,B000X1KWS6,"Part of the ""Angel Max"" (with Peter Falk) series.  I watch this many, many times during the holidays.  ""Finding John Christmas"" is also part of this series.

3230775,5,B000X1KWS6,"Here we go again--a terrific Yuletide movie that for some reason is only available on a Region 2 dvd.  I am very fortunate in that I have purchased a regionless dvd player (as mentioned in a number of my other reviews, prices are very reasonable now and they are as simple to set up as regular region 1 players so why everyone doesn't have one is beyond me).  This movie is an excellent example of why everyone should have one--it was shown on Lifetime years ago and as far as I know, has never been released on a Region 1 dvd.  It is also rarely shown on American television anymore (again a mystery), but there are actually three of these Christmas movies featuring Peter Falk as ""Max"", the-angel-who-might-be-Santa-Claus, all of which are terrific and none in a Region 1 dvd.  I was able to locate ""Finding John Christmas"" this year, which I think is not quite as good as this one, but this story of renewed belief in Christmas and a town rescued from imminent destruction is family friendly and very uplifting.  Patricia Heaton and Rick Roberts are both quite good as the leads, and the smaller roles are filled with stellar character actors.  And then, of course, we have the redoubtable Mr. Falk in one of my all time favorite roles for him, kind of goofy and just plain wonderful.",1352937600,,1287,4.54978354978355
