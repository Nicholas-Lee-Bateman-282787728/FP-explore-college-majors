5216100,4,B0090SI3DY,"If you've ever asked yourself what would happen if William Friedkin - director of The Exorcist and The French Connection - decided to make a drive-in movie, the answer is that he has and that Killer Joe is that movie.  The sub-title in the movie poster for Killer Joe actually sums up the film rather neatly:  ""A totally twisted deep-fried Texas redneck trailer park murder story"".  Except that it doesn't tell you that it's also one of the most darkly comic films to hit the theaters in years, joining the ranks of films like Delicatessen, Pulp Fiction and In Bruges, along with more over-the-top works like John Waters' Pink Flamingos, and Pedro Almodvar's Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!  Truly, Killer Joe is a cult film in the making.

The plot begins with Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) showing up one night in a run-down trailer park, banging on the trailer where his father lives.  Seems Chris's mother, Adele, has kicked him out of her place - again - and Chris is broke, angry and desperate; a bad combination in a guy who's not the sharpest tool in the shed.  Particularly when the shed - or trailer as the case may be - is filled with other tools of questionable sharpness like his father Ansel (a marvelously deadpan Thomas Haden Church), his father's new wife Sharla (Gina Gershon) and his sweetly not-all-there sister Dottie (Juno Temple).

Chris, it turns out, is in a situation.  A not-too-bright drug dealer and even worse gambler, Chris owes some fairly nasty people a lot of money and has no means with which to pay them.  And neither, obviously, does Ansel.  So why is Chris coming to Ansel?  Unfortunately for everyone, Chris has had an idea.  It seems that Chris heard from his mother's new husband Rick that his mother has a $50K life insurance policy and that his sister, Dottie, is the sole beneficiary.  Chris has also heard about a Dallas cop named Joe Cooper who has a rather interesting side-business:  he kills people for money.  So Chris has come to Ansel with the proposition that they hire this Joe Cooper to kill Adele, Dottie gets the insurance money, which they proceed to divide up in equal shares and then Chris can pay off the fairly nasty people before they kill him.

Enter Joe Cooper (a riveting can't-look-away performance by Matthew McConaughey). Dressed almost entirely in black from his cowboy hat and long coat and to his meticulous leather gloves and boots, Joe moves through the world like a rattler always ready to strike, with a voice so supremely controlled that he never has to raise it and cool blue eyes constantly assessing everyone and everything with calm dispassionate calculation.  From the moment this man-in-black enters the scene, two things are clear:  that the Smiths are clearly out of their depth and have no idea who - or what - they're dealing with, and that Joe knows immediately he's dealing with a gaggle of idiots.  Particularly when it becomes clear that they've called him in spite of the fact that they don't have the money to pay him, violating his number one rule:  cash payment in full, up front, no exceptions.  He tells Chris and Ansel to get lost and that their meeting never happened, but when he turns to go he sees Dottie outside, waiting prettily by his car.  And now it's Joe who has an idea.

Having already met Dottie when he showed up at the trailer and Chris and Ansel weren't there, Joe finds himself fascinated by Dottie's strange mix of sweet simplicity and almost freakish perceptiveness with regard to everything going on around her.  Turning back to Chris and Ansel, Joe makes them an offer he knows they won't refuse - since they don't have the money, he'll take Dottie as his 'retainer', to be his until such time as the job is done, the insurance money is collected and he gets paid.  Chris - whose brotherly feelings for Dottie it seems are more than a bit incestuous - loudly objects but is overridden by both Ansel's shrugging what-choice-do-we-have? resignation and his own desperation. And from that point on events begin to tumble out of whatever imagined control the Smiths thought they might have of the situation, building towards a truly freakish climax when things go wrong.

A lot of what makes Killer Joe work is the superb cast and their ability to play their roles absolutely straight without any disarming winks or nods to  the camera, and their ability to deliver bleakly funny lines without laughing themselves, as when Thomas Haden Church's slow-witted Ansel sourly asks Sharla ""Are you done fumigating the gates of hell?"" when she returns from freshening up.  Gina Gershon's Sharla is played to the trailer-trash hilt, a woman who might be slightly smarter than her idiot husband and step-son but who it turns out isn't anywhere near as smart as she thought she was being.  Emile Hirsch's Chris is delightfully pathetic, making you cringe as he careens from one bad decision to another, never apparently having the brains to know when he should quit no matter how many times he screws up and/or gets the crap beaten out of him.  But it is Juno Temple's Dottie and Matthew McConaughey's Joe that truly hold the film's center.  Temple finds the fine line that defines Dottie's mix of seeming innocence and uncanny perceptiveness and walks it subtly, bringing her character out in stages, like when Dottie casually says to a stunned Chris and Ansel ""I heard you all talkin' about killin' Mama.  I think it's a good idea.""  But it is McConaughey who delivers the most riveting - and disturbing - performance as Killer Joe.  It says something that being a contract killer turns out to be one of the more _normal_ aspects of this character, particularly where sex is concerned, which is probably a large part of what earned the film it's NC-17 rating.  The interactions between Joe and Dottie are priceless, particularly in the beginning, where Joe's rattlesnake finds himself repeatedly caught off-guard by this mouse he doesn't quite know what to make of, as in this exchange from their first ""date"" when Joe has dinner alone with Dottie:

Joe:  ""Tuna casserole! May I serve?""
Dottie:  ""How are you gonna kill my mama?""
Joe:  ""That's not appropriate dinner conversation, Dottie.""

It's a pity that a film like Killer Joe will probably get overlooked - or more likely, shunned - at Oscar time because McConaughey's performance as Joe Cooper is, in my opinion, his finest work to date and truly merits consideration for a Best Actor nomination.  All of the cast are truly outstanding in their performances, but McConaughey nails Joe Cooper in ways that will stay with you long after the film is over.  It really is an iconic performance.

Adapted from a stage play that Tracy Letts originally wrote back in 1991 and that had a nine-month off-Broadway run in 1998, Killer Joe is actually Letts' second collaboration with William Friedkin, the first being the equally controversial 2006 film Bug, with Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon, which was also adapted from another play written by Letts.

My only quibbles with Killer Joe as a film are a couple of scenes that went on a bit too long - most particularly the chicken-leg scene - which I felt diminished their over-the-top impact rather than enhanced it.  I also felt the take-the-camera-and-run ending was a tad too abrupt and not really satisfying.  The ending could definitely have used just a bit more, like one more telling line from Dottie, to round things out.  Other reviews have mentioned this but in the end you'll have to judge for yourself.

But these quibbles aside, Killer Joe succeeds in being a near-masterpiece of dark comedy and Southern Gothic drive-in/grindhouse art.  While definitely not for everyone, it is, I feel, a must-see film for anyone who likes their comedy truly dark and over-the-top disturbing beyond any boundaries of nicety.",1346630400,6,7814,4.803437967115097
5216101,4,B0090SI3DY,"William Friedkin has been around for many, many years but the man still knows how to direct a movie. Now in his mid-70s, his sense for movie-making is as sharp as it was 40 years ago when directing ""The French Connection"" and ""The Exorcist"" brought his wide acclaim.

""Killer Joe"" (105 min.) was originally screened at the 2011 Venice Film Festival but a battle with the MPAA over the film's NC-17 rating held up its US release for almost a year. The distributor LD Entertainment ultimately decided to release the film unchanged and with the NC-17 rating. The plot centers around Chris (played by Emile Hirsch), a small time drug dealer desparately in need of money, and lots of it. With the help and support of several others, including his dad and also his mom's boyfriend, Chris decides to hire a contract killer, Joe, played by Matthew McConaughey, to kill his mom and collect the insurance money. All I will say is that eventually Joe does his part of the deal, but that there are a number of complications. To give away more of the plot would really ruin your viewing experience so you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. This movie is a great example of a ""film noir"" and then some, hence I'd call it ""ultra-noire"".

There is a reason that this movie is rated NC-17, so if you are squirmish about violent scenes, do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. But if you can deal with that, you will be in for one wild and entertaning ride. There are several noteworthy performances. Let's start with Matthew McConaughey, who without a doubt brings a career-defining performance as Killer Joe. It's a shame it comes in a movie not a lot of people are likely to see due to the rating, as for me this is an Oscar-nomination worthy performance. Also bringing an astounding performance is Gina Gershon as Sharla, Chris' stepmother. Towards the end of the movie, when all hell breaks loose, she does one unforgettable scene that will raise the hairs on your neck. And last but not least is June Temple, as Chris' sister Dottie. Temple is rapidly building a name and profile for herself (she recently also was in The Dark Knight Rises and The Three Musketeers). In all, beware of the violence, but this is a very dark, yet entertaining and excellent movie. Miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, ""Killer Joe"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1346544000,44,2359,4.641148325358851

5216429,5,B0090SI3DY,"This is a nice trailer park set world crime thriller. Matthew Mcconaughey does a brilliant job as a corrupt cop who is also a hit man,as does Juno Temple as Dottie, a young slow minded in other characters eyes woman who, well is a bit dottie. The other actors aren't as good but they do enough that the story works and allows the two great acting performances to shine. Basically her brother has been kicked out of his mothers' home, so he bangs on his father's caravan in the middle of the night hoping for a place to crash. He tells his father his mother stole his drugs and swapped them for a car, he owes his drug boss five grand for the money or he's dead. The father tells him he hasn't got any money, so the son tells the father his mother has a $50 000 life insurance policy with his intellectually challenged adult sister Dottie as the beneficiary (who lives with the dad). He says he also knows this cop who will kill anyone for $20 000 and they should hire him. He of course wants $25 000 and money up front which they don't have. He offers after having met Dottie, to do the hit if they give him Dottie as a retainer. They of course do, and then we have the rest of the movie. So of course none of these characters are nice people, as what normal people would let that happen to their sister/daughter/stepdaughter.

With the title Killer Joe, you know it's going to be a violent film, there is some full frontal nudity, no sex scenes but there are scenes building up to them where you assume they happened and of course Dottie is only a part of them because she knows the guy before her is a hit man capable of killing her. A drumstick is used in a way that might have you choose alternative fast food options. Oddly some reviews mention a 12 year old girl, there were no children characters in this film. Dottie was probably the youngest and her character was 20 or something like that,at one stage she goes into a coping mechanism where she is reliving events when she was 12 years old, but that's pretty clear that's what's going on. I guess some people just get too distracted playing Candy Crush or something while they watch DVDs these days.",1484524800,,2159,4.330864197530865

5216498,3,B0090SI3DY,"Although visually excellent as a film product, this comes off as just another smirky laugh at the white trash: people who (presumably) aren't like the writer and director, and who don't have the financial and political clout to make trouble for the producers.  Continuing in the fine tradition of ""Tobacco Road"" or Ettore Scola's 1976 ""Down and Dirty"", we see another tribe of clueless degenerates overcome by their own incompetent malignancy.  If you were to pin down play and screenwriter Tracy Letts (obviously inspired by these prior examples) or director William Friedkin, they doubtless would tell you they were ""merely trying to explore the dark and twisted side of human nature as a lesson for all,"" etc.  Friedkin, in refusing to censor his finished product, defended himself thusly:  ""Cutting would not have made it mass appeal. Cutting it would have been the equivalent of what members of the United States government and military leaders said about the Vietnam War. They said, 'We have to destroy Vietnam in order to save it,' and that's what I would have done to Killer Joe. To get an R rating, I would have had to destroy it in order to save it and I wasn't interested in doing that.""  Friedkin's stand for political and artistic ""integrity"" must have been genuine, for the film was so disturbing to theater goers that it grossed under $40K on opening weekend.

There is a specific reason why such depicted paragons of human uselessness have Caucasoid complexions and twangy accents; why the original promo poster read ""A Totally Twisted Deep-Fried Texas Redneck Trailer Park Murder Story.""  Had Letts and Friedkin chosen Texas black or Latino characters to display said ""integrity"" their ""message"" would have been lost under a backlash accusing them of gross racism.  Only the mocking condescension and smug superiority of its promoters would have been evident, not the film's ""artistic complexity"" and ""strong character development"" that ""lifts it above caricature,"" etc.  If they had chosen middle or upper class Dallas whites - well, it would be a little too close to one's gated home, as well as condemned by conservatives as another ""leftist slap at successful Americans."" Better it is to follow the Erskine Caldwell path of class dumping on a group no one right or left will rise to defend.

Matthew Mcconaughey's performance is stellar: as an actor he could depict Jack the Ripper or Charles Manson with equal verve and authenticity.  Perhaps this film will open such opportunity, but better for him if Newton Knight in ""Free State of Jones"" remains his defining role.  At least here his poor white cast could voice some authentic dignity before their history would be hijacked by Caldwell, Lett and Friedkin.",1477353600,,2731,5.017699115044247

5216501,4,B0090SI3DY,"Holy Cow, is all I had to say after watching this unremittingly bleak essay on the worst in Humankind. I am becoming a big Tracey Letts fan, oh he of August, Osage County (the play, not so much the film) and a recurring guest-star role in Season Three of Showtime's outstanding Homeland TV Series, and this film version of his play reinforced my affection greatly. It is not easy to adapt a play that is really meant to occur in a confined space into a film that can fill up a wide movie or TV screen, but Letts (as screenwriter) and the great William Friedkin are more than up to the task. Joe fairly leaps off the screen from the opening scene, as I said in my title, a literal Train Ride Straight to Hell, the story/play that bearing comparison with the best of Harold Pinter or even the recently deceased Edward Albee. It is nearly perfectly cast, from relatively minor characters like the Drug Dealer who wants to kill Chris, all the way up to the tour-de-force performance by Matthew McConaughey. When this film was made, many already knew that McConaughey was more than just a pretty boy, although he had yet to give us his Oscar-winning turn in Dallas Buyer's Club. He probably should have been nominated, and won for his searing, holds only slightly barred performance as the eponymous Joe, because I can honestly say I have rarely seen a performance this good in a long, long time. It is said that most great actors and actresses say more with what they don't say, than what they do and if that is true McCounughey's Joe oozes, projects, and literally instantiates Menace like not character i can remember. Maybe Jack Nicholson in The Shining. This role is that good, and as I said before supported by a fabulous list of supporting characters. Thomas Haden-Church is  absolutely perfect as Chris' Dad, the criminally under-used Gina Gershon fabulous as Chris's stepmom, and of course Emile Hirsch nearly steals the show as Chris. But that show is most definitely Joe's and it does not disappoint. The phrase ""not for the faint of heart"" seems inadequate to descripe this film. But yes, it is.

This one makes the viewer appreciate the power of the actors while deploring the actions of the insidiously vile characters.  We must work out the conundrum in our own ways.
  A family of dim witted drug and booze addled trailer trash folks in Dallas also have no sense of loyalty, decency or goodness so we have a hard time emphasizing with them, except for the innocent and in some way mentally damaged young daughter (brilliantly played by British born Juno Temple).  She would have dominated the tale even fully dressed but she spent a lot of time scantily clad or naked so we really paid attention to her.  Thomas Haden Church played her spectacularly dim and dysfunctional father with understated strength.  Emile Hirsch plays the son and brother and I for one totally believed that he could only have made so many tragic mistakes so quickly because he was both stupid and high. The other actors also put in believable performances.
  But the reason I wanted to see this very hard R rated movie was to see Matthew McConaughey unleash his talent in a role where he successfully plays a psychopath.  His Killer Joe  simply has no feeling for other people, seeing them only as things to be used for his benefit.  Except for the young daughter with whom he forms a loving bond.  Which makes it worse because the daughter looks and seems to be about 16 and not right entirely in the head.  (Juno Temple actually was 23 at the time of filming, whew).  And McCouaughey sells it to the rails, which also gives one pause.  I do not want to know where he pulled this performance out from.
  A movie this powerful must have more than great performances from really talented actors.  The script had play write Tracy Letts to write it from his own play of the same name.  He knew just what he wanted.
  When I realized who directed things fell into place.  William Friedkin has made some 36 films, some of them quit famous and quite disturbing in their own way.  In 1973 (he has been doing this for a long time) he directed The Exorcist.  In 1970 he directed The Boys in the Band, perhaps the most realistic and sympathetic  film depiction of homosexual life in a generation.  In short, he can direct gripping, engaging films.
  So there we are, a really well done film about people we would never hope to meet but who are so realistically depicted that we recognize at least parts of them from real life.

5216551,4,B0090SI3DY,"[Moderate Spoilers] While not your typical movie-going experience and certainly not for the squeamish or fainthearted, the can't-beat cast makes this wild ride all worth it.  Matthew McConaughey plays ""Joe Cooper"" like it's his last movie role (fully committed), who's hired by ""Chris"" (Emile Hirsch) to ""off"" Chris' Mom for the insurance money (yes, you read that right), since Chris has drug-dealer debt and doesn't think anyone would miss her, in this jet-black comedy thriller, complete with an incessantly barking but otherwise seemingly harmless dog named T-Bone (Chris:""SHUT UP, T-Bone!"").  Joe's fee, however, creates another problem, and Joe only agrees if he can hold Chris' sister ""Dottie"" (Juno Temple, who looks like Renee Zelwegger's kid sister) as a ""retainer"" until the insurance money comes in! And Dottie ever so nonchalantly takes it in stride since apparently, according to her, her Mom once tried to kill her as a child!  Oh, did I mention Joe's a detective in Dallas, too, ""like Magnum P.I.""?! Oh, my!  Throw in Chris' infantile Dad (Oscar-nominee Thomas Haden Church, ""Sideways,"" TV's ""Wings,"" who's a real hoot) and second wife (a very game Gina Gershon), who also agree with the plan, shockingly, once they hear they'll get a piece of the pie...or will they? But that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Brace yourself, especially for the NC-17 version and blazing finale (there's also a presumably less-intense R-rated version).  You've been warned!

At least in the Exorcist there was a  Priest trying to make everything better. Nothing is good in Killer Joe. Every character starts out bad and ends up worse or much worse. We are not allowed to find anything to like. Our hero Killer Joe is the town Sheriff who is a hired hitman, basically a paid serial killer. Joe makes everyone he comes into contact with worse than they already are. The whole bunch of them just go descending down a maelstrom to the pits of depravity. Like fast food chicken these folks are ugly, greasy, fried out and unhealthy. After it was over I felt like I needed 1000 showers to cleanse myself.

5217016,5,B0090SI3DY,"Probably the sickest, the darkest, definitely the meanest movie I've seen in a long time. If you like dark movies, and/or you're just a fan of thrillers in general, this movie is for you!

First, let's mention the most excellent performance in the movie, Matthew McConaughey as (Killer) Joe Cooper. There are many a reason he's getting all this praise and this is certainly one of them. McConaughey is almost reptilian in this movie. The way he moves, the way he calculates, the way he talks, it's barely close to that of a human being, more like a cold hearted snake.

Of course there are other great performances like Thomas Haden Church as Ansel, Judo Temple as Dottie, and Emile Hirsch as Chris. But let's be honest here, McConaughey is the true show stealer.

I think the best part of the film is also unrealistic and yet terribly realistic it is as the same time. The characters here are depicted a little ridiculously at times but never to the point where you're doubting if they could exist in real life.

There's only two problems I have with this movie and they are purely marketing problems. First off is the fact that it's marketed as Black Comedy when it's really not. Sure there are funny moments every now and then but for the most part it's played terrifyingly straight.

Second and this is also a fair warning to those who want to buy this DVD. If you've seen the movie in theaters, just beware that this is (as far as I know) no different. The ""Unrated director's cut"" is just the theatrical cut to distinguish it from the R rated version they made so it could be sold in more stores.",1448668800,,1602,4.510344827586207

5217018,4,B0090SI3DY,"Not a movie you want to watch with your kids.

Quite a different role for Matthew McConaughey to play. As a fan of some of his more off-the-wall movies, this movie had me forgetting that it was the typical Romantic Comedy Matthew, and instead just the very strange character he played here.

There are a couple disturbing scenes in this film. Having only seen this film once and over a year ago, those scenes still stick out. Almost like the gimp scene in Pulp Fiction. Just a ""glimpse"" of what's going on, but you understand what's happening & it's....disturbing.

Interesting character development overall. I found this film to be pretty off-the-wall, not your normal run-of-the-line. It held my interest from beginning to end.",1447286400,,729,4.9105691056910565

5217333,4,B0090SI3DY,"In 2006, William Friedkin directed Tracy Letts's Bug from Letts's screenplay (a must-see dark comedy about contagious paranoid dementia). That worked out so well, they paired again to bring Letts's first play to the screen. You'll find it quite something to behold, a showcase for Letts's ability to pull some of our species worst traits front and center, portray their offensiveness vividly, and then have us look at them aghast while tittering as tempers flare and blood flies--well, his is a special talent, indeed.

Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch), a no account and inveterate gambler, owes $6,000. He can't pay it and is desperate, as a loan shark has threatened to kill him. He begs his father, Ansel (Thomas Haden Church), for the money. However, dad is even more of a deadbeat than he is. Chris then reveals that his mother, his father's ex, has a life insurance policy that will pay $50,000. He pitches the idea of contracting mom's death. Dad sees the merit in it without asking the source of the information. Dottie (Juno Temple, who really captures the essence of Dottie), Chris's sister, of whom he is protective, overhears the conversation. She's 20, an innocent, a virgin, who longs for escape from her situation. She endorses it as a good idea. Dad's second wife, Sharla (Gina Gershon), joins in as well, while constantly berating Chris as a moron. Obviously, nobody much likes mom. More obvious, Chris has given the murder of his mother some thought, as he has the likely executioner lined up. That is Killer Joe (Matthew McConaughey, buttoned up and terrific), a police detective with a hitman sideline.

As you might guess, the Smith family is a collection of dim bulbs, ne'er-do-wells who lack even the ability to dream big. Letts plays up every bad trait they possess with both caricature and their casual acceptance of the idea of murdering mommy. Naturally, being as mentally dull as they are, they overlook a few very important details that set the stage for an ending worthy of a Shakespearean tragedy; that is, bloody.

Of these characters, many will find Joe the most fascinating. While the family is disheveled and dumb and always in disarray, Joe is tailored in his dress, respectful in his demeanor, clear in his thinking and communication. Behind the faade of correctness you sense lurks a different person. You would think such as man would steer clear of the Smiths. He would have, too, had he not caught a glimpse of adorable Dottie and decided he wanted her as the Smiths's retainer in lieu of the payment they did not have. Plenty of weirdness stems from Joe's fateful decision.

If you enjoy the film, you might like to read the play&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Killer-Joe/dp/1559364513/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Killer Joe</a>. Or, perhaps you might read the play first and see how the various performances correspond with your conceptualization of the characters. You'll notice that the film expands somewhat on the play, including the loan shark and his minions, and moving scenes out of the trailer. Otherwise, the film is the written play brought to life.",1434067200,,3140,5.09126213592233

5217336,1,B0090SI3DY,"This movie has a sick and unremarkable plot. What is remarkable that McConaughey took on the role of a sicko child molestor within such a dead ended flick. You keep thinking this movie is going to go somewhere, but it really just dies, dies, and then dies somemore....especially at the end of the movie. They do throw in enough facial beatings of both men and women to likely satisfy most sadist and vilographers....so if you are into this kind of thing, maybe you will enjoy this movie. Watching Mathew McConaughey sexually abuse and expose a twelve year old girl must also be enjoyable and titilating for some perverts out there. The pornification a child is definitely intended to appeal to a lower and deviant market segment. I found it revolting and out of character for McConaughey. For those turned on by vilography, this flick probably hits the mark so long as you don't need a plot to go along with the vilography.

With Matthew McConaughey (10 points); Emile Hirsch (10 points); Gina Gershon (8 points); Juno Temple (7 points); and William Friedkin directing (35 points); plus, prolly a 30 point script...i'd expect a 100 point movie, at LEAST.  It falls short, and i'm not exactly sure why.  You bring those elements together, you should be sittin' down for a 142 point film.  The extra 42 points being the 'magic' of this stew.  I feel that in films, the sum should ALWAYS greater than the sum of its parts; but, here it's about equal, roughly.  It's lacking in a depth, and/or breadth that i expect from Friedkin.  It feels like one of those movies that's fallen victim to that modern of afflictions: trying to tell a 2.75 hour story in 1.75 hours.  The HD actually does it no favors; and, in fact may well have benefited from a less pristinely lit, more grainy approach.  Something to give it more gravitas.  Something to make it feel gut-wrenchingly real...something A LA 'Devil's Rejects', or 'Gummo'.  The actors delivery, and the writing itself, is too 'pristine'; too 'clean' and sterile for a story so (potentially) vile, and 'dirty' on so many levels.  Ditto the sets and costumes, too, if you ask me...or, well, in my opinion.
Still a great watch, and would make the purchase, again, even with hindsight...or, foresight, or whatever.  I'd prefer to have had the option of renting it.  I think for a lot of people, waiting 'til you can rent it, is prolly a swell idea...unless you're a big fan of Friedkin, the cast; or, collect movies.  Certainly worth watching; but, whether or not it's the kind of movie that'd warrant a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th+ watch...i dunno.
P.S.-That point system is just, pretty much, made up just as an example.  The points aren't reflective of any measurable distinction,  are more variables than actual/perceived quantitative worth.  Werd.

However, I am including a BIG caveat.  It's probably one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen, funny and horrific almost simultaneously--and this without vampires or zombies or more historically familiar movie monsters.

5217878,2,B0090SI3DY,"Firstly, if this movie aims at portraying the typical trailer-trash stereotype, it would be well served not casting clean-cut actors as uneducated, indifferent cavaliers.

Here's why [potential spoilers ahead]

Thomas Haden Church and Emile Hersch (which I rate as a really good actor) play father and son duo, Ansel and Chris Smith. Chris (Emile Hersch) approaches Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) with the idea of having his mother (and Ansel's ex wife) killed and then splitting the insurance payout (For which his sister, Juno Temple's character, Dottie, is the sole beneficiary).

Here's my problem:
The way in which Chris proposes to his father, that they should have the mother killed, is in such a cavalier way. It's like they're discussing some trivial subject for which the outcome would have no significant meaning. We know Chris's says ""he's always hated his mother"" and that he has physically abused her before. Chris then says he knows a police officer (Matthew Mcconaughey's Joe) who moonlights as a hired killer. The scenario could be believable as I would put nothing past uneducated, red-neck trailer trash from hatching a plan like this, and believing it to be genius outlay.
The main issue is, throughout the movie, Emile and Thomas seems to be too ""clean-cut"" for this sort of task. Also, they're not at all convincing of being uneducated to the level of stupidity (which is a requirement for the plan they're hatching).
They don't have that ""dirty scourge"" you would expect. Throughout the movie, Emile's hair is neatly kept (even though it's long). His facial hair is perfectly trimmed. His teeth, a glorious white. He seemed all bright-eyed and bushy tailed. He's a supposed drug dealer, but doesn't have the street smarts that comes with dealing (yes, I know this movie has a certain dark comedy air about it).

I do love the lines these actors had at their disposal. It's just that they're too clean-cut to to do it justice. Which is a shame considering the make-up department did a phenomenal job with violent scenes (blood, wounds, bruises, etc.)

On to Matt's Killer Joe, good, creepy acting. Nuff said.

Dottie's character... spot on.

But the best female performance I have seen in a long time has to go to Gina Gershon's portrayal of Sharla Smith (Ansel's wife and stepmom to Chris and Dottie). She is the only reason why I gave this movie an extra star otherwise, I would have to give it one star.

Hope I succeeded in not giving away too many spoilers.",1392681600,,2481,4.890476190476191
5217879,5,B0090SI3DY,"An exciting and provocative movie with some  lowlife characters!

However, if you want to see some great acting, thoughtfully played out scenes, and moments that will stun you in your seat - this is the movie for you.  Especially if you've noticed Matthew McConaughy is breaking away from stupid romantic comedies, and moving into a serious, respectable acting career.  This is his best performance.

5217961,1,B0090SI3DY,"Why anyone would want to watch the director's cut of a movie that features what had to be at least 15 strait minutes of a bloody and beaten woman being forced to perform oral sex on a chicken leg, is beyond me. Sure, I should be blaming the author...blah blah blah...it's not the actor's/director's fault, etc, but this film made me feel horrible to watch. Too often in movies, rapey violence can get severely indulgent. I have to say I resent these qualities, even in classics like A Clockwork Orange. I wish I could say that the cliffhanger ending of Killer Joe was a disappointment, but just like Very Bad Things and Trainspotting, I was just glad to see that this movie was over. It's not just the subject matter, but also the way it's handled. I loved Witherspoon and Sutherland in Freeway, and I laughed hysterically despite the appalling image of a strangled grandmother's corpse. Maybe I'm a sucker for a redemption/revenge type plot, but I don't like movies that make me feel horrible about humanity. Lovelace left me with a better feeling than this movie, but I can say it was a good movie simply because it told the truth. There is a big difference between telling the truth about indulgent people in real life, and just indulging in a rapey make-believe that is not based on reality. However, on screen it can be a very thin line. I may be in the minority among people who are too numb to be offended, but I personally could use an additional rating system to warn me of torture or rapey scenes.

That's mostly the play, I guess, which Tracy Letts himself has dubbed a ""young man's play,"" but it's not like Friedkin held anything back. I kept thinking ""courage of one's convictions"" as I was watching (through my fingers).

Others have found this play/movie ""condescending""; I wasn't feeling that at all, but these are characters who aren't easy to watch and from whom some viewers may want to distance themselves by any means necessary.

Despite the ultraviolence, fans of ""Night of the Hunter"" and the original ""Cape Fear"" will probably want to check this one out. There aren't many actors today who have even a fraction of Mitchum's presence, and McConaughey has that and arguably greater chops.

5218036,4,B0090SI3DY,"Tracy Letts' work typically portrays the lowest of the low in humanity and Killer Joe is no exception.  Because his work is so controversial and in-your-face, subtexts and even key overt elements are often overlooked.  For example, I have never read a single review that explores the reason Dottie is the way she is - she clearly suffered brain damage when her mother tried to asphyxiate her in her infancy, an incident she claims to actually remember.  In addition to the obvious disgust elicited by her dim-witted father's and ""devoted"" brother's willingness to have this fragile, virginal creature defiled by Joe as a ""retainer"", the brother's sexual desire for her is palpable.  One oddity is despite the fact people are shown vomiting, bleeding, and spitting on the floor, the trailer in which the main action takes place is and remains relatively neat and clean in appearance.  The actors all turn in genuine performances. If you've seen the play, you will never think of Killer Joe as anybody but Matthew McConaughey again.  While the other performances evoke emotions ranging from deep pity to utter disgust, McConaughey makes Killer Joe a person anybody in their right mind would fear from the moment they met him.  The violence is graphic, but believable.  We need to be reminded of the consequences of real violence sometimes lest we all succumb to the GTA mentality that it's all just a game we could go out and replicate in real life without harming anybody or anything - a mentality that may have resulted in recent mass shootings at malls, movie theaters, workplaces, etc.  If you want to see a film that moves you on an organic level, see this.

5218037,3,B0090SI3DY,"This repulsive movie came from a repulsive play and it plays like a play in some regards. Not one character here is decent; except perhaps the son who at least tries to free his sister at the end . but even he is a grotesque person. In fact , what makes this movie so repulsive is that you just know that there are people really like that out there.  And this is about rotten trashy people that are the scum of society. At least the kids in this story have a excuse as they were raised by the monster of a father character.  I work in schools and meet people that frankly starve their kids for dope money. or worse abuse them etc, even pot heads can be that low. But this group didn't need drugs to be the lowlifes they are , they just are trashy people. And that's what the play is about. , however the ending is left , with a open ending that surely the play did better? well maybe  NOT!. IF you don't want to watch a movie about horrible people that will sicken your stomach , then don't watch this film. But it is ok as a strange study in complete familial dysfunction I guess.  If you can get past the ending. Mathew mconoanay is pretty chilling in his psychopathic role here. And he's the ""killer' in killer joe. HE's A evil police and hit man. who , would be caught in reality eventually as people talk. and he's known to way too many people inthis film, Perhaps they should have made him a straight criminal , that would be someone that would be easiest to actually get away with murdering people . Anyways, unlike a horror film , the family in this isn't too far removed from a disgusting reality that may exist in your town. THis will leave you with a nice bad taste in  your mouth. Which is what they were trying to do when they made the film. SO on that level it's a success, I would say this is a easy movie to hate, or you can enjoy the parade of human garbage as they self destruct here.  And that's the goal. SO the movie is good at depicting what it wanted to.. This is not for kids though. It's a cult flick for sure. And it is watchable on that level for sure. But be warned , this is not for most viewers who don't like rancid stories about rotten people!.  There was a great song from the 1960's , by the kingsmen, (the guys who did the song ""louie louie) called 'killer joe' , I wonder if the play writer ever heard it?  oh well...  this looks great in hd , but the film is set in just a few places , just like a play , so don't except , too much scenery!.",1379116800,2,2478,4.0718685831622174

On film it's all up close and most of the humor is drained from it - there's no audience laughing to let you know what's funny - and what's left is the uneasy, sick horror of the whole situation. There are a few great scenes that make you squirm appropriately, like Joe's creepy seduction of the 21 year old virginal girl, but the violence is in your face, bloody, and unpleasant. The play's most notorious scene - Joe forcing a woman to fellate a drumstick - was hilariously awful and horrifying onstage, but in the movie it's almost unwatchable and ghastly.

However, in this disturbing but (in my perspective, also hilarious) movie, Matthew shows a crazier side to him. Sure, anyone who's bothered to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation can see that he could deliver an odd personality when given the chance but rather than the hilariously wild man he's demonstrated before, this movie gives him a chance to show that on-the-edge kind of guy where anything can make him tick, and he's completely unpredictable. The chicken leg scene is a delight (watch the movie and that scene will make you rethink taking a chicken leg ever again). With the help of the actor who portrays (sorry, I don't know this actor's name) Ansel, this movie comes out to be comical. Without the aforementioned, I would be a little unhinged.

As Chris failed to come up with money (cash in advance), Joe only agrees on the condition that he can have Dottie (Juno Temple) Chris' sister as a ""retainer.""

The relationship between ""Killer Joe"" and Dottie (played by quirkily attractive Juno Temple) that is surprisingly sweet at times could have been developed into something more interesting - something William Friedkin, director of ""The French Connection"" and ""The Exorcist"" is not interested in.

1- The screen play is poorly adapted from what can only be described as a sketch of a play. The story just doesn't develop and the dialog is halting.
2- A lot of the acting is bad. Sure McConaughey and newcomer Juno Temple are excellent but all of the others give transparent performances. When bad acting is as consistent as this I tend to think it's the fault of the director.
3- Very, very, graphic violence. Watching this movie made me feel like I was suffering. In a movie where the storyline doesn't go anywhere it seems that the entire reason it exists is to showcase blood and
4- Beaver. I don't know the last time I've seen that much bush. Seriously. When a viewer sees something jolting and intruiging like naked lady parts it makes you think something interesting is going to happen so you stick around and watch the movie when you otherwise may have turned it off.

It is difficult to believe that this was a stage play - the gore and brutality would be difficult to reproduce without  CGI. But then it comes courtesy of William Friedkin who has never been know for subtlety.

The story is not terribly unique: a drug dealing kid Chris(Emile Hirsch) needs money to pay off a bad gambling losses and hires a  hit man who happens to also be a cop and a detective and is known only by Joe (Matthew McConaughey)  to kill his degenerate mother for her life insurance money which is to go to the woman's daughter Dottie (Juno Temple) who lives with Chris' and her dad (Thomas Haden Church) and her new sleaze bucket mother (Gina Gershon). Of course it all goes terrible wrong with beatings and broken promises and retainer deals, but the whole ugly family gets it in the end with a family dinner  that is unlike any ever seen in film endings. KFC chicken legs will never seem the same!

Oddly enough the cast is so fine that it makes the entire grisly mess watchable.

I have watched it several times now - and all the actors are just superb! This movie explores the human limit of darkness, and how things only seem bad, and then just keep getting worse. This movie is well made - no scene is wasted.

I think that the real culprit of the events originates with the character of the mother. It is the absent character, and this character start the events years before they take place. Killer Joe is just a benefactor of the absent mother's original darkness/ fault - and in many ways he is there to salvage what is best in the dysfunction of the family. I keep coming back to what is killer Joe really a killer off? He is able to judge the situation correctly right away, and sees the unspoken truth. His stare hurts because he sees down to the uncomfortable truth and inner being. He gives a choice, and he provides what was asked for - at a price of course.

5218479,5,B0090SI3DY,"If there is a theme to William Friedkin's Killer Joe, I believe it is stated by ol' Joe himself in Latin: The buyer should beware. That is essentially how I feel about you considering this movie. Not because its bad, far from it, but if you're looking for that easy going Matthew McConaughey from all his romantic comedies or you were looking for a great movie to watch with the kids tonight, you may want to consider buying Sahara instead. Now if you're looking for a sick, despicabley good time with a family that pushes the term 'dysfunctional' to its breaking point, this may be right up your alley. This is McConaughey in what might be his greatest role, hands down. At a time when he seemed to be becoming a one trick pony who's no-shirt-antics were quickly becoming old and one note, the character of Killer Joe Cooper is a dark, meticulous and downright menacing figure that you can't take your eyes off of (no matter how much you may want to). He takes it to a place that is so bizarre by the end, its almost not human. Conversely, there is humor in the movie, albeit the darkest of dark humor you can get, from the foul-mouthed, somewhat dim-witted Smith family. Emile Hirsch kicks ass as a guy in way over his head. Its a real shame that he hasn't had enough praise for some of his performances like this and Into The Wild, which he so greatly deserves. Most of the pure comedic moments come from Thomas Hayden Church as the father. Gina Gershon gives a surprising performance from the moment she enters the film (and the first inclination that this movie is clearly rated NC-17). Lastly, Juno Temple squares out the cast of brilliantly acted characters as Dottie, the jail-bait sister who is surprisingly lucid for a girl so clearly not all there. So if you're looking for something dark, twisted, funny at points and horrifying in countless others, or if you're looking for a quick way to wean yourself off fried chicken for a while (trust me here), you may want to think about picking this flick up tonight.

Initially, his good looks combine with his smooth and relaxed manner paint a big contrast with the ""trailer trash"" caricatures of the family that hires him, but McConaughy does a great job of letting the crazy out later on.

5218550,4,B0090SI3DY,"The movie is about a young man who's a drug dealer, has the drugs he supposed to sell stolen from what we believe to be his mother, fact later dictate it might not be true, but the audience never knows.  Anyway the drug dealer finds out there's a 50,000 dollar life insurance policy for his mother that's left in his sisters name.  He then plots with his dad, who's now remarried, his Wife and the sister to kill his mother, The hear of this detective/hitman Joe.  They try to hire him but there's a problem they can't pay Joe the money for the hit because they need the mom to be dead to collect the money.  So Joe whose taken with the virginal innocent sister, takes her as collateral in all the terms imaginable.

Some of the problems for me is we never really meet the mother's boyfriend, I felt if we met him it would have filled in a gap in storytelling that's left open.  The movie ends at the climax, like when the movie enters the climax it just stops and cuts to black, it right at a powerful scene when a character is at their breaking point.  The first scenes fill fake as we get used to the characters and just how dumb they are, but after a couple minutes they had me convinced. The last scene of the movie which is like thirty minutes long is so good and intense it was hard to turn away, even though you want to.

The movie has great performances all around, the stand outs being Gina Gerhon, Matthew McConaughey and Juno Temple.  The rest of the cast does fine but seems to be playing catch up, when they're around.

The comedy of the film is in how shallow and stupid the main characters are, and how the southern pleasantries are mixed into these intense scenes.  I laughed at how absurd everything is like the drug kingpin telling him how much he likes him, but you don't have my money so I'm about to beat the crap out of you but I do really like you, remember that.  I laughed out loud twice once during that scene and one other.

The movie was originally released as NC-17 I don't know if I'm just used to HBO shows like True Blood, and Game of Thrones, or other show like Dexter and Spartacus, but nothing seemed all that extreme. There one intense scene where someone in forced to do an act which makes you feel pretty disgusting, yet can't turn away.  There is a couple of bush shots, and one's a close up in  a scene that's meant for shock value, and there are various boobs through out.

I'd recommend this movie for lovers of dark dark comedy, people who loved the movie Funny Games,  People that want to see Matthew McConaughey step out of his just a charming guy thing, not to say he's not charming in this he is but his character is the devil and uses his charm as a weapon.",1360886400,2,2706,4.25390625
5218551,4,B0090SI3DY,"Killer Joe(released July/12)stars Matthew McConaughey as Det. Joe Cooper,Emile Hirsch as Chris Smith,Juno Temple as Dottie Smith,Gina Gershon as Sharla Smith,Thomas Haden Church as Ansel Smith,and Marc Macaulay as Digger Soames. Deftly directed by William""the Exorcist""Friedkin,this southern trailer park family story,involving murder with a twist,is an intriguing yet sometimes disturbing film. One minute it's sending up its redneck roots,and the next the action gets as intense as anything you've ever seen.
The story introduces us to the Smith family;father Ansel,his life,a slow learning curve,his overbearing son Chris,who treats his dad like a child,Chris's sister Dottie,who is the youngin' of the family,a virgin and quite withdrawn due to""family"" issues,and Ansel's second wife Sharla,who is not a home body,to be sure. It's the old joke,if you look ""dysfunctional"" up in the dictionary,you would find their pictures there. Chris it seems has gotten himself into a little jam. He owes the local money man $10,000 and no one in the family has it to give. He is so desperate that he takes the advice of a friend by the name of Rex. Rex tells his buddy that there is a Dallas police detective by the name of Joe that does hits as a sideline. If Chris employs Joe to take down his father's ex wife,the recipient will receive $50,000...that being his young sister Dottie. And besides,Joe only charges $20,000. It sounds like a plan to Chris,who talks to his father about it. He actually gets him drunk,to be specific,at which time dad agrees to go along with it.
The rendezvous is made and in walks Joe. Joe explains with a calm demeanour and in simple terms,the rules of the contract. And oh yes,his fee is $25,000,not $20,000*gulp*.The two agree to Joe's terms but Chris tells him they have no fee,in advance. They want to wait until the cheque comes in,so to speak,in order to pay him. Joe is having none of this and starts to walk out,when he thinks of an idea. He has seen Chris's younger sister and has taken a shine to her. He will take her as a retainer in lieu of payment,until the cheque clears.
Chris has been weaving and dodging his creditor,Digger,all over town. His boys eventually catch up to him and Digger and he catch up on the local goings on,with Chris apologizing for not being able to make Diggers party the past month. Digger says he really likes Chris but his boys are going to have to do a number on him anyways. And if the money is not paid within two days,he will be officially six feet under. Chris comes home,bleeding profusely,to a real cozy homestead with Joe living temporarily with the Smith clan. Chris is getting antsy about his sister's relationship with Joe and he asks him to call off the hit. Joe shows Chris the trunk of his car,which reveals he has already done the deed. Chris is forced to drive with Joe to a remote location and put the body into another vehicle,which Joe promptly torches,to hide any evidence of foul play.
The next day Mr and Mrs Smith are at the lawyers office to talk about his ex's will. Chris and Dottie are waiting for them when they come out and the news isn't good at all. It seems the will isn't payable to Dottie but to Rex. Joe smells something rotten. With a little snooping and a little ""pressure"" put on Rex,Joe confronts Ansell and Sharla at the dinner table after their return from the funeral. Joe's eyes and words are all aimed at Sharla. He asks her about the insurance money. Then he goes onto some nude pictures he ""obtained"" of and from Rex;the case from which they came out from,we had seen earlier in Sharla's possession. There are some extremely tense moments as Joe gets quite violent with Sharla and all Ansell can do is watch,horrified. It seems Sharla has been having an on going affair with Rex for sometime and that the insurance money was for $100,000,not $50,0000! It was all a scam on Rex and Sharla's parts to get the money for themselves.
Chris meanwhile arrives home and things quickly turn sour as Chris tells Joe to leave his sister alone. Faster than you can say ""chitlins"",the two are wrestling on the floor. Unbeknownst to the rest,Dottie gets the gun Chris had pointed at Joe. Joe has announced he and Dottie are to be married,while Chris says that she is coming away with him. Dottie gets up to leave and both are after her attention,when she spins around and shoots Chris. She then shoots her father and points it at Joe. It is then she reveals she is pregnant. Joe's face beams as he asks Dottie to put the gun down. Just as her finger moves back to the trigger,the film cuts to black.
Will she shoot,or won't she?It was a great spot to leave it. Matthew McConaughey absolutely nailed his part as the cowboy hat wearing Dallas cop,with his ultra calm demeanour and affectations. Thomas Church also really nailed his character as the man-child/father of the Smith clan. Each and every other actor were totally into their parts and brought their characters individual idiosyncrasies to vivid life. There was nothing that wasn't believable about these people. The film had some extremely intense and sexually oriented moments though. Everything up to the confrontation scene near the end,I bought and had little problem with. The part where Joe is forcing Sharla to ""swallow"" a drumstick I thought was just over the top and unnecessary. That is my only criticism of the film. When it wasn't intense it could tug on the heart strings,especially when we learn of Dottie's background. Then at other times the film had a good sense of humour,such as the straight up funny moment when Sharla picks a thread off of Ansell's suit shoulder,and the arm falls down. This is American Gothic on steroids!
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all a wonderful film about dysfunctionality in the south,set amongst a murder with a twist. McConaughey is fabulous in his part,and the rest of the cast rise to the occasion also,bringing their characters to life. Warning some scenes can be sexually graphic and are not for anyone under their late teens. Recommended.",1360886400,,6129,4.761278195488722

5218558,4,B0090SI3DY,"Well, if you like your humor dark, real dark and you like your violence sudden and unexpected and you like your nudity all up front, have I got a movie for you.  In a film featuring a family of a dictionary-perfect picture of ""trailer trash,"" we get an early look at what is to come.

Chris (Emile Hirsch), the 20 something son comes banging on the trailer home of his erstwhile family, locked out in a driving rainstorm in north Texas.  Answering the door is his stepmother, Sharla (Gina Gershon) with her bushy bush staring young Chris in the eyes.  It appears the boy owes the local loan sharks $6K and could lose his life if he doesn't quickly come up with the money.  Ansel (Thomas Haden Church), Chris' father doesn't have any money and doesn't seem to care much either.  Certainly Sharla is no help as she hates Chris and just about everybody else.  Chris' virginal sister Dottie (Juno Temple) completes the brood.

They discover that Chris and Dottie's mother and Ansel's ex-wife has taken out a $50K life insurance policy and believe young Dottie is the beneficiary.  Everyone hates the alcoholic/drug addicted ex.  Even Dottie, as her mother tried to smother her as a youngster.  Remember, I said it was dark.

Enter the picture Dallas detective Joe Cooper (brilliant Matthew McConaughey).  It seems Joe also has a sideline.  Murder for hire.  Only problem is that Joe can't get paid until the life insurance policy is cashed.  So Joe makes a deal after seeing sweet, innocent young Dottie in the flesh.  He will use her as collateral, or a retainer as Joe explains it.

All the characters are perverted, but only smooth talking Joe has anything between the ears.  The film has a couple twists and turns that will keep you guessing between scenes of the dysfunctional family.  Directed by the long absent William Friedkin (""The Exorcist""), the film is not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach.  It is likely you will never eat another KFC fried chicken leg again.",1360454400,2,1978,4.691860465116279

5218640,5,B0090SI3DY,"""Killer Joe."" What is this film: Violence porn? Image porn? Pointless? Visual prurience? Dark unto indecency? Oh yeah, all this and more! Except pointless. ""Killer Joe"" has very serious messages, but not for any of its characters. All of these characters, except perhaps the girl, are lost (the viewer learns at the end just how lost), but the girl is redeemable, perhaps.

But as usual, I get ahead of myself. Matthew McConaughey is Killer Joe, a cop by day, a killer, an assassin by night, that is, for a high cost. In this case paying his price is dependent upon killing a woman for her life insurance earmarked for her 12-year-old daughter (yes, she looks much older and surely has the luscious body of a mature woman, but she plays 12). Joe demands a retainer and demands the girl. McConaughey's sexual encounter with this child-woman is a piece of prurient perversion gone amuck. Shocking? That's too weak. Unconscionable for sure. Sick, indeed, but the scene is very necessary in delineating Joe's character. He is not just a cold-hearted, brutal killer--he is a whacked-out sick-o, deserving of absolutely no sympathy. The viewer will never look at McConaughey the same way again. He's not just a pretty face--he's a talent now with nothing left to prove. He can do comedy. He can do romance. He can do serious. Now he can do evil.  Denzel Washington did it, too.

Thomas Hayden Church is the biological father of two children with his ex-wife, now married to another man. There's a generous life insurance policy assigned to her daughter. It's a complicated, twisted plot about the whys and wherefores of the intended plan to kill the woman. Joe carries it off with inhuman indifference.

Then the twist is revealed and an already ugly situation turns gruesome and shockingly violent. One scene involves a chicken leg and the plumped lips of a very attractive Gina Gerson. From this point on, many reviewers were reviled by the apparently meaningless violence and resulting bloodbath. But I disagree. I think Director William Friedkin had a very serious message. Whether my take on the movie corresponds with his is irrelevant. It's how I see what the director has given me. I put my own stamp on this creative process with my interpretation.

Here it is: As an English teacher I taught ""Lord of the Flies"" every year to high school seniors. I've always thought this novel essential to any curriculum and a good education. It teaches moral lessons, social bonding both good and bad, the infiltration of evil and its overpowering attraction and its subtle and blatant take over and extinguishing of all moral ambiguity. By novel's end morality is being burned and evil is rampant and all-consuming. I used to ask those seniors: Tell me. What happens when these boys go home? What will they become? What will they do? Or, now, I might ask: Who are you-- to each boy survivor (a new lesson gained from ""Flight"" with Denzel in a new acting situation. After you've played a rabidly corrupt cop, you might get any kind of role as Denzel does here). Who are you, indeed.

The key scene in ""Lord of the Flies"" occurs at the edge of the beach when one of the little ones is sitting and playing with a crab. It's called play, but it's a control issue on the verge of death of the crab. One of the older boys is casually throwing stones around the boy, never hitting him, but wanting to. Mores dictate that we don't throw stones and especially not to hit. But the thought is there. He intentionally does not--yet. On the other hand the boy will possibly kill the crab by happenstance, or not.

The characters, all of them, except perhaps the girl, have taken that step beyond missing long, long ago. The first time opens the door. Isn't there nearly always a second? Well, I've done it once, blah, blah. Until there's a blood bath. Clearly, the director is making his message visibly potent: evil is a dark path leading to despair, pain, and possibly annihilation. Is this where you are heading? Who are you?",1360368000,,4006,4.730659025787966

Killer Joe is a sleazy thriller nominally set in Dallas but actually unfolding in a backlot trailer park of the collective crime movie unconscious. The plot is strictly by-the-book noir (a murder for insurance money), and though the characters all have names it's easier to keep track of them by their film archetypes: there is the Implacable Cold-blooded Villain, the Kid in Over His Head, the Dumb Guy, and the Femme Fatale. Killer Joe tries to mix it up by throwing a wild card into the mix, Dottie, the virginal teenaged sister of the KiOhH who is offered as collateral to hitman Joe (Matthew McConaughey, cast effectively against type). Joe moves in with her and her family until the money comes through (a conceit that probably isn't such a distracting implausibility on stage) and the two start a kinky relationship that consists of creepy jailbait lust on his part and Stockholm Syndrome on hers. Even though he keeps them offscreen for much of the running time, Friedken's willingness to jump into the muck of their ugly power game is the heart of the film. Early on he inserts a few strategically gratuitous nude shots of actress Juno Temple as a way of saying to the audience ""leer away, guys"", and midway through is a seduction/domination scene that recalls the business in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Velvet/dp/B003U74NQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Velvet</a>&nbsp;involving Dennis Hopper, Isabella Rossellini, and a tank of nitrous. We don't know what to make of Dottie. One minute she's guileless to the point of seeming mildly retarded, and the next she's chirpily approving a plan to kill her mother. The idea appears to be to have her character act as a discordant piece that throws the rest of the stock noir elements into jarring relief. This almost works, but Dottie is too weird, too much of a writerly conceit even within the stylized world of the movie, and the third act confrontation in which things go inevitably south plays out like an exercise, without real tension. If you get more than halfway through the movie you should stick around for the last shot, in which the familiar lovable goofball Matthew McConaughey creepily emerges from beneath the shell of sociopath he has played up to that point, but don't feel compelled to make it that far. Watch Bug instead.",1360022400,,2613,5.4068627450980395
5218645,3,B0090SI3DY,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  Probably the most shocking thing about 'Killer Joe' is not its over-the-top violence (particularly toward women) but the fact that the film is based on playwright Tracy Letts' play of the same name and that he is ALSO the author of the excellent Pulitzer Prize winning drama, 'August: Osage County'. How could Letts be the author of such a superb work as 'Osage County' and also churn out such sensationalistic 'pulp fiction' as 'Killer Joe'? The gap in time probably explains it: 'Killer Joe', the stage drama was originally written in 1991 and 'Osage County' came out first in 2007. Obviously Letts has matured tremendously since the early 90s.

  'Killer Joe' is not without its good points. I would have to agree with critic Rex Reed's assessment that the ""uncompromising trashiness"" was ""perversely riveting, until the ending, which pours on the gore like barbecue sauce."" It's a story about a Texas 'trailer trash' family, whose amorality is unwavering. One is riveted by just how far these clueless nitwits will go as they plot the murder of one of their own.

  The murder plot is set in motion by Chris, who plans to pay a debt to loan shocks, by murdering his mother for her insurance money. He comes to believe, after speaking with his mother's boyfriend, Rex, that his virginal teenage sister, Dottie, will inherit the money. Joining in on the scheme is Chris' real dad, Ansel, along with his new wife, Sharla, as well as Dottie, who was abused by their mother as a child.

  After Chris hires a Dallas police detective, Joe Cooper (who moonlights as a contract killer), he makes it clear that he won't commit the murder without being paid first. When Chris indicates he won't be able to collect the insurance money after his mother is dead, Joe agrees to accept a 'retainer'--which happens to be Dottie. As a result Joe enters into a sexual relationship with the alluring teenager. It's perhaps at this point in the film that I began to suspect that one of director Friedkin's motives in story-telling was decidedly prurient in nature (cases in point: the obsession with Dottie's nude body and the unpleasant way in which Joe seduces Dottie; scenes in which little is done to advance the plot).

  After Chris has a change of heart and wants to call off the murder, Joe makes it clear that the killing has already taken place (he matter of factly shows Chris his mother's dead body in the trunk of a car, and then sets it on fire!). The plot becomes even more dark when the family realizes that gullible Chris was duped by Rex, who is the actual beneficiary of the insurance money, not Dottie.

  The final twist has Joe revealing that Sharla knew all along that the insurance policy was actually double ($100,000 and not $50,000, as Chris previously believed) and that Sharla was having sex with Rex and was set to share in the settlement. Friedkin, unfortunately, is not set to leave things at that. The dark comic mood of the film is lost when Joe beats Sharla to a pulp. Wait there's more! Joe simulates a scene of forced oral sex utilizing a piece of Kentucky Fried Chicken (ugh!).

  Without the extremely dubious scene where Joe beats up Sharla and simulates oral sex, the denouement may have been more palatable. Dottie turns the tables on both her brother and her father by shooting them. And the final scene has her finger on the trigger, ready to blast Joe to smithereens as well. It seems a fitting end to these lowlifes but what exactly is the point of all of this?

  'Killer Joe' is worthwhile for its shock value; however Mr. Friedkin provides us no explication for his character's actions. He's saying, enjoy the ride as I reveal just how low these amoral lowlifes will sink. Unfortunately, at times, he reveals an unnecessary and excessively nasty side to his characters, that have no place in a narrative which is designed strictly to amuse and entertain.",1359849600,6,3931,4.721815519765739

Mathew McConaughney is OUTSTANDING and the other cast members are excellent as well.,1358294400,2,378,4.23943661971831

5218940,4,B0090SI3DY,"I'll start with a disclaimer that, YES, the movie is extreme in a lot of ways. If you are offended by profanity, nudity, and the challenging of morals OR, you simply wanted to watch McConaughey smile his way through a typical male-lead role, then this isn't for you. This movie IS for audiences who want to see the darker and more desperate side of humanity. Most of the characters are not good people and you probably won't sympathize with them but this story is about characters rather then relation to the audience. This is the kind of movie that dares the viewer to go outside their comfort zone and experience terrible things at least from the comfort of your couch. McConaughey goes out on the ledge and delivers an ambitious performance as ""Killer Joe"", a terrible guy, but he's probably one of the most interesting characters you'll see on screen recently. I'm not sure what some of these disappointed people were expecting from watching the trailers but nothing about this movie said it was going to be a ""light-hearted, comedy with happy, relatable characters"". And you might as well ignore the complaints about the budget being $10 million. This isn't an action movie with CG and car crashes to pay for so who needs $50 million? These actors joined this movie (and in some cases, took a pay cut) in order be a part of a very different movie with interesting (yet disturbing) characters.

Violent and some times gory (certainly not the kind of film I normally endorse)  I highly recommend this film to an adult thinking audience.  The sexual scenes are gritty and absurd.  As a woman, I found them disturbing.  To watch this film you have to step away from what you feel is moral and right and just observe how the characters interact . It is as if all the wacky crap in America got boiled down into a thick soup of insanity.  If for no other reason, see this movie to see Juno Temple as the waif like Dotty.

5219104,4,B0090SI3DY,"This is one movie that I'm still trying to wrap my brain around. Talk about a dysfunctional family! This one is one for the books. Matthew McConaughey is great as Joe, the contract killer who also happens to be a Cop. Enter a young man who has run out of ways and ideas to get money he owes drug dealers. So he comes up with a scheme to kill his mother, the initial cause of his trouble, for the insurance money. But he needs help...he goes to his father who is more upset that he is not the benificiary to the insurance money even though he is married to someone else. The sister is the innocent in all but even she cannot claim full innocence since she goes along with the scheme mainly because her ""slow"" mental capacity is due to her mother. But they have no money up front to give Joe, so he takes her as a retainer fee. What evolves from there is truely one for the psychology books as they try to get the insurance money, save the sister from Joe and survive the hate they have for one another. McConaughey is great as Joe and a credit to his acting ability as he portrays a very cold,calculating and sick killer. His scene in the kitchen with the stepmother and fried chicken leg is intense and will leave you holding your breath especially as they begin turning on each other. This is not a movie for everyone as I believe one reviewer stated and definately not your typical murder for hire movie. There is nudity which could have been left out without harming the plot line but other than that, this is one movie that will probably not win awards but is worth seeing.

Chris (Emile Hirsch) is a young coke dealer who is in hock for $6,000 for 2 ounces that was fronted to him and apparently stolen by his mom. Okay I know that is too much for 2 oz. and no one fronts drugs, but go with it. His equally slow witted dad (Thomas Haden Church) lives there as well as his step mom (Gina Gershon). To round out the group is their dog Tebow and child-like sister Dottie (Juno Temple) who reminded me of the Hillbilly Ninja (Google it) in one scene.

Chris believes his real mom, who he suspects stole from him, has a $50,000 life insurance policy and names the half witted Dottie as the beneficiary. Their plan is to hire ""Killer Joe"" (Matthew McConaughey)a Dallas detective who moonlights as a gun for hire. Without the up front money, Joe takes Dottie as a ""retainer"" to the ire of Chris who perhaps loves his sister a little too much. This provides us with a very erotic scene between Juno and McConaughey.

There of course is a problem with the expected twist, and another twist thrown in just in case you thought you were clever, although there are clues that most of us would ignore.

5219300,5,B0090SI3DY,"`Killer Joe' is a GREAT film!

Matthew gives his best performance since 'A Time To Kill', but completely different and very daring, particularly for Matthew who has unfortunately been wasting his considerable acting talent on insultingly ridiculous films such as `Failure to Launch', `Fool's Gold', and numerous other insipid offerings.  We seemed destined to wait for `Dallas Buyers Club' to catch even a glimpse of Matthew's talent again, but `Killer Joe' rescued us with an uncharacteristically risky, rich, and surprising performance by McConaughey.

I recommend `Killer Joe' to anyone who can appreciate an R-rated film (Killer Joe, originally NC-17, is not rated on this recently released DVD.) We've seen so much nauseating unnecessary violence in films that had nothing whatsoever to offer; whereas this film has an overwhelming amount of entertainment value along with its violence.

The entire cast was pitch-perfect with a particularly understated but rewarding performance by Thomas Haden Church. Wm Friedkin at 76 delivered an amazing directing job and Letts' writing was top-notch!  The edgy dialogue was simultaneously jolting and smooth.  Best of all, the humor was startlingly black, but oh soooo delicious!

'Killer Joe' is a stunningly 'different' film that stuns and entertains every sense!!!!",1357171200,3,1313,5.567839195979899
5219301,3,B0090SI3DY,"Billy Friedkin must have been trying to emulate the Coens or Tarantino when he decided to make this one. But if so, it's a poor imitation; no one can handle black comedy like the Coens. There is no subtlety or wit in this film, but I have to admit that there is a bit of humor, if you don't mind being hit over the head with it like a sledgehammer. There are people this stupid out there, I guess. You do hear about husbands and wives being killed for the insurance money, over pathetically tiny policies like $25K or $50K. So in a sense one could say that the subject matter for this film has been 'ripped from the headlines'. But who cares? Everything has been dumbed down to the point that even a person with the IQ of Haden-Churches' stupifyingly moronic Ansel--I'm guessing 75?--would be able to follow this plotline.
And it seems all so patently false to me, particularly the actors and the roles they are playing. Gina Gershon is a spectacularly beautiful 'older' woman, whose perfect body is obviously the result of countless hours of gym sculpting and careful dieting, perhaps even surgical enhancements, hardly the type of woman who'd live in a trailer park, work in a pizza joint, and be married to a cretin like Ansel. Haden-Church is a big, handsome, he-man type of guy, and I found it hard to believe he could be so idiotic and so ineffectual. Then we have McConaghey. I didn't buy him as the big, bad, killer rogue detective. Like Tom Cruise, he is a very slight, small man--I'm betting he had to stand on a box to tower over Emile Hirsch--and I can't understand his appeal to women. There are very few scenes of just he and Haden-Church together, because Haden-Church is probably twice his size. It would have been better to have Haden-Church play his part. To me, MM just seems like a poser, a little guy acting tough, like Stallone or Cruise. His black get-up of cowboy hat, shades, leather jacket, pants and boots was laughable, not menacing. These people are all too good-looking to be credible in their roles.
But if you assume that the entire movie is just a caricature of redneck behavior, then you might be entertained. But this is the opposite of enlightening or creative. I didn't find it funny, as so many others have done, because it is so witless. Not one of Friedkin's better movies.",1357171200,,2313,4.575903614457832

5219342,5,B0090SI3DY,"William Friedkin scared the pants off us with the classic THE EXORCIST.  Although there are no supernatural demons in KILLER JOE, the same visceral effect is achieved with this disturbing tale of the evil men do.  Based on a 1991 stage play, Friedkin hasn't just filmed a stage play.  Though mostly confined to a mobile home, the movie is so perversely hypnotic, you can't take your eyes off the screen.
Originally rated NC-17, KILLER JOE is brutal, violent, sexually repulsive, crammed with pervasive foul language.  Along with Friedkin's amazing direction,the movie's greatest strength is the stunning performance of Matthew McConnaughey as the vile title character.  Hints of his potential were evident in A TIME TO KILL, FRAILTY, THE LINCOLN LAWYER and even the flatulent MAGIC MIKE.,  But Matt proves there's more to him than picturesque pecs in this film.  He is riveting, repugnant and remarkable.  An Oscar nomination would be appropriate if more people had seen the film.  Kudos also to B-movie veteran Gina Gershon who is devastating and gives a whole new meaning to finger lickin good in one of the most disturbing scenes in recent film history.  This performance should open many doors for Gershon.  Thomas Haden Church is excellent as the addle-brained father/husband whose simple-mindedness masks an inherent evil---a volcano waiting to erupt.  Juno Temple as Dotty is as evil as Joe--in a pseudo-innocent manner.  She is quite chilling.  While Emile Hirsch is serviceable as ne'er do well Chris, he is overshadowed by the cast around him.
KILLER JOE is not an enjoyable film per se, it is a movie experience to admire and appreciate for its sheer audacity and the talent involved.",1356998400,4,1695,5.094202898550725

5219430,5,B0090SI3DY,"In the opening moments of director William Friedkin's KILLER JOE, you're going to know whether or not you're the target audience for this film as Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch; INTO THE WILD; MILK) is let into his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church; SPIDER-MAN 3, SIDEWAYS) and stepmother Sharla's (Gina Gershon; SHOWGIRLS, BOUND) trailer by Sharla who is wearing nothing but a shirt. If you repel in moral disgust and indignation, you're really not going to like this film at all. If you are unsettled, find it funny, or shaken by this moment, then you are probably someone that will enjoy this twisted amorality play.

Chris is desperate. He owes more than he can pay to some violent bookies and hatches a doomed scheme to kill his birth mother for her insurance money. He gets his father in on the scheme by assuring that a near-mythical hit man named Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a Dallas homicide detective, will do the job. But since they don't have the money, they only have one option available: Joe will do the job with a retainer on receiving the $25,000 he demands for his work. The problem is that the retainer is Chris's sister Dottie (Juno Temple; THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, ATONEMENT), a beautiful, innocent and very strange young woman. Once things are set in motion, the film begins to reach a fever pitch of hilarity, violence and disturbing sexuality leading to its unforgettable final act, which has events likely to stay with you for some time.

Friedkin collaborates once again with Tracy Letts, a playwright who also adapted another of his plays, Friedkin's 2006 much more disturbing BUG and this is yet another thing that will very likely polarize audiences. The highly-stylized direction and dialogue have the sensibilities of being more theatrical than cinematic, but Friedkin and his decades of experience bring the visual fabric of this film to very vivid life. The script is something like the deranged love child of Sam Shepard and surrealist Maria Irene Fornes; hyper-real at certain points and terrifically bizarre at others. Another thing about this film is that I don't know exactly what the differences might be between this ""Unrated"" cut and its theatrical NC-17 cut, but they can't be too far removed from one another. It's not a film packed with scenes of sexuality or extreme violence; in fact, there are really no ""sex scenes"" to speak of. But the film does have scenes of explicit nudity, and the one scene guaranteed to garner its NC-17 rating is not a scene I will describe here, but it's a scene of sexual violence involving fried chicken that, frankly, you can never unsee. Again, this is NOT a film for the faint of heart.

As far as the performances, they are career highs for just about everyone involved. Hirsch brings as much sympathy and relatability to an intensely unlikable character; Gershon, who hasn't really been seen in quite some time, gives easily her best performance since BOUND; Haden Church is wonderfully funny as the unforgivably dim Ansel, and his deadpan delivery and facial expressions are in top form. But the real triumpths belong to Temple and McConaughey, who do the best work of their careers thus far here. Temple, who hasn't been in much, and rarely in a highly-featured role, shines with a radiant beauty and wide-eyed innocence particularly as she regales with stories of her only boyfriend that she had in the third grade, and the way she describes the attempt on her life by her mother. McConaughey owns this film with what is truly his best work to date. He does away completely with the charming good-ole-boyness that he often brings to his work, and instead oozes menace with an evil intelligence that allows him to be so good at what he does, a steely gaze that is almost hypnotic, and a calm demeanor that holds something much more frightening beneath it.

KILLER JOE seems to exist in the same sub-genre of film (what I, and others call ""Redneck Noir"") as The Coen Brothers films BLOOD SIMPLE and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. While it includes many of the tropes of noir, it also turns them on their heads with such bravura and skill that it puts most other modern neo-noir films to shame. It's a terrifying and challenging masterpiece of filmmaking, and it's a shame that most audience members looking to see a dark comedy with Matthew McConaughey The Movie Star are going to be sorely disappointed because Matthew McConaughey The Actor has arrived, and I look forward to seeing many more films with THIS Matthew McConaughey in them.",1356825600,13,4512,4.825581395348837

The look of the film is colorful and well saturated, not washed out by any means. It looks beefy. Very cinematic, nothing in scenes that shouldn't be there. This movie is up there with the best of Tarantino in terms of dialogue, cinematography, and explosiveness. The acting is awesome. Great kudos to Juno Temple's innocent Dottie, Thomas Haden Church's mum's the word and ""Yes, sir"" dimwitted and humble Ansel, and Gina Gershon's cheating Sharla.

5219507,4,B0090SI3DY,"William Friedkin is a director people either love or hate.  Interestingly, ambiguity in human nature is the theme most often explored in his films.  This film is populated with few, if any likeable characters.  Though they are interesting!  Much has been said about Matthew McConaughey's performance, and indeed it is noteworthy.  Much better than his overrated Magic Mike.  I particularly like Emile Hirsch as the dim wit that hatches a convoluted plan to kill his mother. There are also good performances from the rest of the cast.  There's a certain surrealism to Killer Joe.  You watch most of the movie in disbelief.  Is this for real?  The seedy locale-supposedly Dallas (the movie was shot in New Orleans) is perfect.  I dare say they couldn't have picked more suitable locations to support the dilapidated world these people live.  Shot beautifully, and edited with a pace that reminds you that Friedkin is the same man that gave us two near perfect films (The French Connection. and The Exorcist) Both still stand after 40 years.  I don't think this effort reaches that level of excellence, but it is apparent that you are watching the work of one of the most underestimated directors ever.  Friedkin has never gotten his due. Killer Joe proves he is still able to deliver a visceral, exciting, and original movie experience.  Check out some of his other films:  To Live and Die in LA, Rampage, Cruising, Sorcerer, Bug, and of course the aforementioned French Connection and Exorcist.  All explore the duality of man and make for compelling viewing.  As a viewer of a Friedkin film you are never quite sure where the characters stand, or how you feel about them, and there are no tidy answers. You are usually left with more questions.  Not typical hollywood fluff.  When he came to prominence as a filmmaker, movies that provoked thought were popular.  He hasn't waivered as a filmmaker-the taste of the audience has!  Killer joe definitely provokes,and jolts-like a double shot of red bull.  Warning:  this film has some scenes of intense violence.  I had to look away twice, but wasn't distracted.  It seemed relevant, and indicative of just how depraved a world these characters live.  The film is funny and repellent at the same time.

5219569,5,B0090SI3DY,"William Friedkin's `Killer Joe' is one of the most shocking, vile, disgusting, sick and twisted piece of white-trash film noir that I have ever seen. I think it's also one of the best films of the year.

The film revolves around 21 year old Chris Smith (played with hyperactive intensity by Emile Hirsch) who attempts to clear himself of a mountain of debt by hiring a hit-man to kill his estranged mother, in order to collect $50,000 of insurance money. With a gang of loan sharks threatening to take his life, time is an issue. Chris runs the idea by his father, Ansel, at the local strip joint, and while the dim-witted Ansel is hesitant at first, he ultimately agrees that it would be a great idea. The next day, Chris hires ""Killer"" Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to do the job for him. Joe is an detective by day, as well as a hit man on the side. He asks for an advance payment of $25,000, but Chris is unable to pay. As a result, Joe takes Chris' twenty year old sister, Dottie, as a ""retainer"" until he receives his money. Ansel's wife Sharla (Gina Gershon) is hesitant at first, as she doesn't trust Chris because of his tendency to be unreliable; however, she plays along regardless.

In the meantime, Joe and Dottie enter into a sexual relationship and become quite fond of one another. This agitates Chris to no end, and before the credits roll, everything goes straight to hell in a blood-soaked, much talked about finale.

Make no mistake - this film earns the NC-17 rating and then some. It is not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. The notorious ""chicken leg"" scene is just as abhorrent and disturbing as you've probably heard, and is the sole reason for the NC-17 rating. William Friedkin is on top of his game here and pulls no punches. The sordid lives of these disgusting characters are graphically brought to the screen, written for the screen by Tracey Letts' in an adaptation of his stage play. This Southern-gothic noir is beautifully shot by Caleb Deschanel, and the score by Tyler Bates is appropriately twangy and unsettling.

The performances are uniformly amazing. McConaughey is at the top of his game here. This is an Oscar worthy performance, unlike anything that the actor has every accomplished before. Gina Gershon is incredible in her role as the double-crossing Sharla. Juno Temple is in full-on Lolita-mode as Dottie, creating a complex character with many unpredictable quirks. Thomas Hayden Church plays against type as the stupid, southern-fried redneck, Ansel. Finally, Emile Hirsch is fantastic as Chris, delivering his best performance since his underrated contribution to `Milk'.

`Killer Joe' is a fantastic film, but once again, it is only for the brave. The faint hearted and easily offended are advised to steer clear.

`Killer Joe' is 1 hour and 45 minutes, rated NC-17 for ""graphic disturbing content involving violence and sexuality, and a scene of brutality"", released by Lionsgate. Available on Blu-ray and DVD.",1356566400,8,2980,4.844793713163065

I won't describe it so as to avoid a spoiler, but it takes you completely out of the movie and has you either laughing or shaking your head at the director for including the scene. Also, as I'm sure others have lamented, the unresolved ending is not a device that leaves the audience with any satisfaction.

Chris (Emile Hirsch) owes money to the local mob and decides to kill his mother because he heard from his mother's boyfriend that she has a life insurance for $50,000 and that he and his sister are the only beneficiary. That should have been the first warning sign for Chris already that things are not going to turnout nicely! He hires Joe (Mathew McConaughey) who is a cop and part time professional killer. But Joe asks payment upfront and because Chris cannot afford it, Joe takes his sister Dottie (Juno Temple) as a retainer. This is the second warning sign for Chris!

The acting is really great but the movie really lacks a real interesting plot and assumes that all people living in trailers are pure trash. Gina Gerson runs around totally naked for the first five minutes of the movie. Nothing to see there, it is ugly, grotesque, and poorly done!

Emile Hirsch, his performance was very forced and he is unbelievable every time he threatened to beat Thomas Hayden Church's character, ridiculous. The story was as much a waste of paper as it was a waste of celluloid. A degenerate family out witted by the boyfriend of the woman he tricked them into killing. A mentally challenged, sexually abused daughter (Nell meets Texas chain saw massacre' stir in Bangkok Dangerous and add a twist of any Jerry Springer episode of recent memory) and you'll have the movie ""Killer Joe""

5219662,5,B0090SI3DY,"Chris has a problem: he's into some bad people for some big money.  When he discovers his mother has a large life insurance policy in her name, he schemes with his deadbeat father and his stepmom to kill his mother.  To do this, he turns to Joe Cooper.  Joe's a police detective with an unusual side job: he's a contract killer.  Joe only has two rules: if you get caught, you never heard of him; and you always pay up front.  When Chris confesses a problem with the latter, Joe quickly finds a solution, taking Chris's child-like sister Dottie as a retainer.

KILLER JOE is dark.  It is very dark.  Nor is this apparent from the get-go; it slowly builds atmosphere, spiraling upward into a roaring crescendo of an ending.  The film is anchored by the central performance from Matthew McConnaughey, who nails every line, every stare, every step he takes.  McConnaughey plays off of his trademark charm; Joe is a nice guy...until he lets the act slip for a heartbeat, and you see the psychopath underneath.  McConnaughey's performance is so strong and forceful, you have to take a step back and realize that he's not the only actor in the movie.  In fact, the entire central cast is surprisingly good.  Emile Hirsch, as Chris, embues an otherwise despicable character with a sense of conscience.  Thomas Hayden Church provides much of the levity here; and yet, there's something unnerving about his performance, as though he's only a step or two away from becoming as crazy as Joe.  Gina Gershon's performance is haunting and hilarious; the same goes for Juno Temple, as the innocent Dottie.  Dottie threatens to be the least interesting character here; yet, thanks to Temple, Dottie comes across as a fully fleshed-out young woman.  Her and McConnaughey's scenes, despite their rather blandness compared to some of the film's extremes, are among the hardest to watch.

KILLER JOE is not a film for the squeamish.  It was filmed as NC-17, and it doesn't shy away from it.  There's nudity and there's violence, all of it hard to watch.  Tracy Letts' pitch-perfect screenplay (based on his own stage play) not only embraces its white-trash underpinnings, it dives in face-first.  And yet, the film is actually a comedy--a dark comedy, to be certain, so dark that some of the humor isn't immediately apparent (McConnaughey, in the bonus features, admits to not ""getting"" it on his first read).  One moment you're laughing; the next, you're trying not to wince.  Throughout it all, your attention is riveted to the screen.

I believe this is a modern masterpiece and shows just how great William Friedkin can be. He nailed this and made a movie for adults. Well deserved NC-17. Appropriate for sure. Just once in a while Hollywood can make a truly awesome piece of cinema.
Matthew M., who I never warmed to as an actor, was stunning! What a wonderful performance. Sick, creepy, debauched, mean, charming... I could go on. The other cast members were superb!

It's a rather simple film, but personally I found that to be one of the main qualities that made it work.  Both the individual characters, as well as their individual relationships with each other was perhaps the best aspect to Killer Joe.  Just enough plot to keep you around in order to witness one helluva awesome performance by Matthew McConaughey.

McConaughey's performance in the last 20min. or so of this film is truly brilliant as far as I'm concerned.  He doesn't always deliver, but when he does it's always well worth the price of admission.  I feel he did as good of job in Killer Joe as the last great film I watched of his which was Lincoln Lawyer(5 star film imo).

I'm sure lots more people will rank this movie 1star, and describe it as horrible given it takes a certain depth upstairs to appreciate.  For the simple viewer, the rich artistic aspects will most likely be missed by them in this film, thereby making this movie pointless or stupid to them.

William Friedkin still hasn't lost his touch as a filmmaker even though audiences haven't given such praise since his movies are off the wall crazy and have no plot. After watching this movie, you will be asking yourself, what the hell just happened but you can see how that contributes to the darkly comic nature of the film. Like I said, the film's major problem is the plot because there is no plot and the pacing of the movie is extremely slow. I wouldn't even say there is an ending because there is no resolution.

The cast is amazing, William Friedkin directs the heck of it and Tracy Lett's dialogue (who adapted his play of the same name) just sparkles with trailer trash ingenuity and also hilarity at multiple points. I also wasn't prepared for how darkly comic the film was even as it goes further off the rails in terms of overall depravity as the film goes along to a truly crazy climax which involves a twisted act that was solely responsible for the film's theatrical NC-17 rating (which I don't agree with, but the MPAA has proven time and time again that they hate independent films).

  William Friedkin... wow!
  Decades ago -- thanks to ""The Exorcist"" -- one could see that Mr. Friedkin possessed, let's say, some unusual sensibilities.  More often than not, however, he kept them under wraps.  And gave us some great, more mainstream, films like ""The French Connection,"" ""To Live And Die In LA,"" and the underrated ""The Sorcerer.""
  But, back to those ""sensibilities...""
  A few years ago, Mr. Friedkin gave us ""Bug.""  Which, I'll admit, I'm in no hurry to ever see again.  Yet -- to sort of borrow from the film -- ""Bug"" did mange to get under my skin.  And seems to have set the table for ""Killer Joe.""  Meaning that with ""Bug,"" Mr. Freidkin may have been getting warmed up to deliver us the gem that is ""Killer Joe.""
  I'll leave it to others to describe ""Joe's"" plot.  And point.
  But while watching ""Joe,"" I felt a bit like Alex in ""Clockwork Orange.""  In that my eyelids were propped open and I was unable to avert my gaze from what was on the screen.  Even though I wanted to.  Watching (Spoiler Alert!) someone get their face bashed in with a 28 oz. tomato can (for what seemed like minutes)... hard to think of that as great cinema, but, somehow -- in ways I don't begin to understand --it was.
  Anyway, ""Killer Joe"" is Mr. Friedkin at his best...  him sticking a mixmaster into one's head and turning the switch to the ""high"" setting.

When drug dealer Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) loses his stash of cocaine, he winds up in serious debt to some violent thugs.  Chris comes to his father (Thomas Haden Church) with a plan; they should hire someone to kill Chris' biological mother so that his emotionally damaged sister Dottie (Juno Temple) can claim the life insurance.

The hitman of choice:  depraved Dallas detective and part-time murderer Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey). Because the plan is crazy to begin with, there is no place to go but down.  Amid loads of NC-17 violence, the scheme spirals out of control, with one unforseen event setting off another as the bodies pile up.

It is a story between a Texas family and a hired killer based on a play by the to-be-watched playwright Tracy Letts and directed by the master filmmaker William Friedkin.
Among the master filmmakers, Friedkin is one of the few who continues to produce brilliant films with wisely selected independent projects.
His latest film is an expertly directed and acted film by the ensemble team headed by the continue-to-amaze Matthew McConaughey and the brilliant script with an engrossing story which seamlessly mixed macabre with humor, with excellent cinematography, art direction and music.
Other than McConaughey, Emile Hirsch, Juno Temple, Gina Gershon and Thomas Haden Church gave everything they have to this film.
The only negative aspect of this film is the violence which is excessively done, in my view.

5219909,4,B0090SI3DY,"The plot is simple in this film.  It is the execution which makes it.  A family that is the living embodiment of the term trailer trash, complete with the trailer, decides to knock off another family member to collect the insurance. They need to hire a hitman, who is also a Texas lawman, to do the deed and that brings Killer Joe into this family. Every cross and double cross imaginable emerges from this hiring and the film is a combo of hilarity and mayhem.

This film is a major comeback for director William Friedkin, who is now 76 years old. His movies have never been for the faint of heart.  They are all violent. So I don't view one of his movies expecting it to be placid in any way. Matthew McC is the lead as killer Joe and he does a wonderful job.  I haven't liked his roles in his rom com career and if this is the end of his rom comming, I am all for it.  He seemed to move in this direction with ""Lincoln Lawyer"" and then built on that performance with this role. The only other actor I can picture giving this performance is Woody Harrelson as this performance reminds me of his role in NATURAL BORN KILLERS.

We are in for many other treats with this film besides McC and Friedkin though. Emile Hirsch plays the dumbest drug dealer who has ever trod the dust in the trailer park. Everything he undertakes is a disaster. Thomas Haden Church plays his father and you can see the acorn did not fall from the tree.  These are the two who hire the hitman. The father's slatternly wife is played brilliantly by Gina Gershorn, who is unrecognizable in her trailer trash get up. Her extended scene with Matthew McC is the best in the film. Caleb Deschanel is also on board for his as usual brilliant cinematography.

My favorite Friedkin film is CRUISING with Al Pacino, which virtually everyone hates, including Pacino.  So if you have doubts about this film, read some reviews by amazon reviewers who don't like virtually all of Friedkin's work, as I do.

I am giving this four stars instead of 5.  It is very, very good.  Maybe even 4.5 stars.  However, it is not the EXORCIST, FRENCH CONNECTION, or CRUISING, all Friedkin films. It is also not TRUE ROMANCE, the five star film it most closely resembles.

5219912,5,B0090SI3DY,"Few films contain such a palpable mix of dark comedy and brutality as William Friedkin's Killer Joe. The film reunites Friedkin with writer Tracy Letts, who last worked together on 2006's Bug. That film was a memorable little oddity that polarized audiences. If you have the stomach for it, Killer Joe is the superior film. For Friedkin, whose career was built on successes he had decades ago, it's a roaring comeback. For the star Matthew McConaughey, it's a career renaissance. In the last year, after serving time as the go-to guy for romantic comedies, McConaughey has begun taking on more daring roles and this is his most daring yet. It's also his best performance.

Most of Killer Joe takes place in a trailer park somewhere in Texas, home of the Smiths, a family of rednecks for whom the word `philistine' was almost certainly invented. Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) is a drug dealer whose mother has stolen his stash and left him desperately in debt to some guys who will kill him unless he comes up with $6000. Learning of his mother's $50,000 life insurance policy for which his sister Dottie (Juno Temple) is the beneficiary, Chris approaches his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) about the prospect of having his mother killed. Not only would this solve Chris' problem, but it could lead to a big payday for Dottie, Ansel and his current wife Sharla (Gina Gershon). The person to do it is Joe Cooper (McConaughey), a Dallas detective who moonlights as a hitman. After they meet with Joe, he demands $25,000 in advance that Chris and Ansel are unable to provide. But Joe is willing to negotiate and will accept a retainer; Dottie.

There's no telling who is working against each other in the Smiths family. Although they lack any semblance of sagacity, their ignorance spawns both humor and horror. There's a sardonic glee in the way their story unfolds; we never know the length of stupidity they're capable of. The only redeeming character is Dottie, who seems mentally slower than her family (quite a feat), yet innocently more aware.

Letts' script is an adaption of his own play yet, unlike many stage adaptations, there's never a sense that this was made for the stage. One reason is Friedkin's fearless direction and the other is Caleb Deschanel's unflinching cinematography. Killer Joe was initially rated NC-17 (eventually surrendered) and it's hard to recall a film that so deserves it. This is a violent, bloody, misogynistic, and often sadistic film that basks in its lurid tendency to push the envelope. However, there's much more to Killer Joe than mere shock value. It's self-aware and crackles with great dialogue and memorable performances from everyone involved. It jumps right into the plot but slow burns with quiet intensity before erupting into total chaos, fueled mostly by McConaughey's menacing and frightening performance.

Before becoming a romantic-comedy heartthrob McConaughey appeared in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation and for all that film's shortcomings, he did an exceptional job playing crazy. Even with that performance on his resum, who could've foretold McConaughey could deliver such a memorable performance that allows him to exploit his natural charisma and charm to play completely against type and make Joe Cooper's ferocity and stark brutality all the more shocking? The performance is so unconventional and horrifying that it won't lead him to an Oscar, but few will argue what an Oscar-caliber performance this is. The other stand-out is Church, playing a character so stupid it takes the right kind of actor to keep it from bubbling over the top. Church's comically silly facial hair and his gift for deadpan make Ansel the comic relief of the film, but he keeps the character from seeming contrived or false within the film's context. He's a gifted actor who never fails to please and surprise.

The conclusion of Killer Joe features a long scene involving McConaughey, Church, Gershon, and a chicken leg that stands out as one of the most nail-bitingly intense scenes of any film this year. It's hard to anticipate a scene more startling or suspenseful. Here McConaughey reaches deep into his acting range to show the depths of Killer Joe's (both the movie and character) depravity; this is the moment where he totally sheds the rom-com image. If the Academy were more willing to award edgy, brave performances, this moment would almost certainly win him an Oscar. It's a scene that bristles with energy and no matter how chaotic and shocking it becomes, you can't look away.

Killer Joe is a film that gets in your head and stays there. It's a shocking and powerful film that makes a devastating impact. It's certainly entertaining, but make no mistake, it's not for the faint of heart and will disgust and revolt many an audience member. It's one of the most disturbing films of 2012. It's also one of the best.

5219913,1,B0090SI3DY,"I had the recent misfortune of watching William Friedkin's filmed version of ""Killer Joe"". The storytelling is shrill, adolescent, and contrived. The plotting is creakier than the creakiest B-movie Film Noir plot. There is not one likeable, intelligent, or interesting character in the play. The Killer character is directly borrowed(or stolen) from Jim Thompson, but has none of that grand existential menace that Thompson could so effortlessly put into his sleazy psycho characters. The sexual shaming scene with the ""K-Fry-C"" just doesn't work, not even with A-list actors giving it their all. It's just ugly and stupid and goes on too long. It's unfortunate that a fine actress like Gina Gershon can't find better work opportunities. This story is like something a mixed-up 18 year old kid wrote for his first playwriting workshop at a state college. I don't know any of Letts's other work, and I probably shouldn't have started here. But I can't believe that anyone who wrote something this awful, small, and cheap could ever have written anything that won national awards for literature and theatre. The worst crime here is the way the author condescends to his characters. These are not real people. They're boutique white trash, deliberately drawn to be as stupid and petty as possible. If these characters were black, latino, or native indian, the author would be branded a racist. I want my time back! I want someone to whack that plummy pedantic douche Friedkin across the face with a dead bluefish, or a sack of wet horseS#!t. Seriously, folks. It is that bad.",1347408000,11,1572,5.026819923371647
5219914,3,B0090SI3DY,"Tracy Letts' brilliant black stage comedy has been made darker, bloodier and not quite so funny in this NC-17 collaboration with director William Friedkin. I loved the devastatingly funny and audacious stage play but found myself uncomfortable with a number of scenes in the movie. Why is it necessary to ramp up the sex, violence and gore for movies? I guess Friedkin will never learn that overkill is overrated.

The movie is extremely well-acted, so I can't complain about this sterling cast:
  * Matthew McConaughey (""Magic Mike"") continues to grow as an actor. As Joe, the cop who takes ""side jobs,"" he is chillingly effective, particularly as you notice his courtly manners, good grammar and icy no-nonsense style.
  * Emile Hirsch (""Savages"") is Chris, the dumb cluck who owes more debts than he can ever repay. His reaction goes from petulance to panic. It's his solution, an insurance scam, that starts things rolling. Hirsch gets better and better.
  * Juno Temple (""The Dark Knight Rises"") is Dottie, the brain-damaged young woman who serves as the family's ""retainer"" for her brother's deal. There is never a moment when we doubt her intellectual limitations, and she makes a good tuna casserole.
  * Thomas Hayden Church (""We Bought a Zoo""), sporting the world's scraggliest beard, is Ansel, the cuckold father of Dottie and Chris. He is so bewildered and terrorized he can't even help himself!
  * Gina Gershon (""How to Make it in America"") is Sharla, Ansel's faithless wife.

As was true in the stage play, the most effective elements in this story are the ones we DON'T see, which is why I am so disappointed by all of the things we DO see: Lots of violent beatings, gun play, and prolonged sexual innuendo. At least with the DVD from Amazon.com, you can use the fast forward.",1347235200,8,1792,4.858552631578948
5219915,5,B0090SI3DY,"The late Roger Ebert said in his review for ""Killer Joe"" that the film left him speechless--and that's saying a lot, especially from a guy who's seen a lot of films. Rated NC-17, this was only available at the Opera Plaza Theater in the city (SF), but the small theater was packed! The audience laughed, gasped and--just like Ebert said--were rendered speechless by the shocking, blood-soaked finale.

An inevitable cult classic, there are many scathing scenes (one including the creative use of a chicken drumstick), and a lot of slick, smooth dialog--especially from Joe (brilliantly played by Matthew McConaughey) who just happens to be an officer of the law who moonlights as a killer for hire.

Hats off to veteran director William Friedkin, at 76 he has lost none of the edge he displayed in the 70's with his gritty police thriller ""The French Connection"", or his synth-infused masterpiece from the 80's ""To Live & Die in L.A."". The story, adapted from a play by Pulitzer Prize winning author Tracy Letts (""Bug""), is right up Friedkin's alley, behind the bloody black humor his fatalistic view of human nature still shines through.

There's horror in ""Killer Joe""; audiences cringed with pure horror back in the 70's with ""The Exorcist"", this time they gasped and giggled at the same time.

The overriding criticism against this film is that its characters are deplorable, and that the ending was ""unsatisfying"". Question: who says a film has to have likeable characters? Your film school instructor? Ever seen Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull""? The main character (Jake La Motta) is near sub-human, but the film is now considered a classic character study of a self-destructive, sadomasochistic man. And the ""unsatisfying"" ending--well, if you want a classic climax and resolution check out the top 10 grossing films in America, and steer clear from anything that isn't in the top 10.

P.S - Friedkin fans, as the screen cuts to black and Clarence Carter's 80's song ""Strokin"" starts blaring, don't we nostalgically recall the ending of Friedkin's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cruising-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B00005JO5L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cruising (Deluxe Edition)</a>, the film Al Pacino still refuses to talk about?",1346630400,124,2272,5.443181818181818

8533490,1,B0090SI3DY,"Synopsis:  Low-life Chris Smith (portrayed by Emile Hirsch) needs to pay off a loan shark or he'll be killed.  He turns to his dad Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) and step-mom Sharla (Gina Gershon) for assistance, but they don't have any money.  He then concocts a plan to kill his biological mother for an insurance pay out but needs to enlist the assistance of ""Killer"" Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) in order to carry this out.  Since they have no money, Joe takes Chris's sister Dottie (Juno Temple) as his ""retainer.""  Though Chris needs the money (and gets jumped for being broke), he doesn't approve of the relationship between Joe and Dottie and wants to end it.  Will they go through with the act of killing the mother?  What could go wrong?

Basically, the portions of this movie which weren't there purely for shock value (albeit through violence or sexual content, sometimes both) were slow-moving and tedious.  I cannot believe this film was rated as high as it was.  While I can accept the actors did the best with what they good, the direction didn't tell much of a captivating story and basically gave us a story which serves as an excuse to see Gershon, Temple, and McConaughey engage in full frontal nudity.  The NC-17 was well deserved considering the actual penetration shots in the ""incriminating"" photo sequence, but it would've been better had it told a better story.  The ending, above all else, was utterly ridiculous and basically had me laughing at the movie (not with it.)

I don't recommend this to anyone.",1515974400,,1533,4.805343511450381
