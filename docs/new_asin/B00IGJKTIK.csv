8641999,2,B00IGJKTIK,"What I liked... some of the video shots of corvids in their natural habitat near the coast. I live in this area and enjoy watching all the corvids by my home. The negative aspect to this ""documentary"" is the Director constantly stating why he likes ravens more than crows. As the film goes on, the obvious slant towards ravens becomes way too predictable. If you enjoy the raven & crow equally, the directors constant reminders to his preference of ravens may annoy you. I enjoy a more objective documentary.",1506643200,,508,4.719101123595506
8642000,4,B00IGJKTIK,"Pretty fascinating. After a totally useless and seemingly distracted and unrelated introduction, the narrator shows tons of footage of crows and ravens and explains his observations of what the main differences are in crow and raven personality and society. Worth watching if you're fascinated with either of these two birds.",1431734400,2,325,5.52
8642001,4,B00IGJKTIK,"This documentary contains lots of video sequences of both ravens and crows.  After watching it, you'll learn how to distinguish the difference between these two birds when observing them in flight, when just hearing their calls, or when seeing them perched.  For all of it's positive aspects, I wish this video would have gone deeper into discussing more about raven and crow behavior.  The video could have made more of a potential teaching moment.",1426982400,,449,5.04054054054054
8642002,2,B00IGJKTIK,"As a viewer of many nature programs I was disappointed with this film. The narrator  and producer spent most of the film comparing raven and crow playful behavior and discussing the ways to identify each species. I was hoping that he would discuss their eating habits, differences in culture and chick raising. Basically I was bored.",1425945600,,333,4.946428571428571
8642003,1,B00IGJKTIK,"Just so we're all totally clear about this film: It is shot on cell phone while some guy talks about how he feels about ravens.  This is a home movies-grade hobbyist project and while I commend the creator for his hard work, to call it a documentary is borderline willfully misleading.",1419120000,,285,4.588235294117647

8642006,5,B00IGJKTIK,"If you're entertained by corvids, or think you might be, this will be a worthwhile purchase.  It's a fun way to glean useful information and to see the birds in their natural environments.",1397606400,,188,4.696969696969697
