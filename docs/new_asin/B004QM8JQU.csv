6282942,3,B004QM8JQU,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN POTENTIAL SPOILERS

At the beginning of the film, Ash, Brock, and Dawn are watching a match of the Pok&eacute;mon Baccer World Cup at a Pok&eacute;mon Center.  While watching the television, a man exhibits his team, which consists of the Legendary Pok&eacute;mon Raikou, Entei, and Suicune.  Ash and his friends are traveling to Crown City to watch the next match live.

Meanwhile, Zoroark and Zorua are traveling in a plane.  During the trip, they find themselves face-to-face with the three Legendary Pok&eacute;mon.  Watching from above is Grings Kodai, the man who appeared on the television with the Legendary Pok&eacute;mon, along with his assistant, Rowena.  Zoroark is held captive by Kodai, and a Ninjask swoops down and takes Zorua.  Zorua manages to escape, but falls from the plane.  This Pok&eacute;mon uses its illusion ability to transform into Skiploom, which allows it to fall a little more gracefully toward the ground.  Ash, Brock, and Dawn end up getting lost on the way to Crown City, and save Zorua from a group of Vigoroth.  Using telepathy, Zorua explains about Zoroark going to Crown City.  The three trainers agree to help Zorua.

Kodai uses an image of Zorua to blackmail Zoroark into destroying Crown City by disguising as Raikou, Entei, and Suicune.  At the same time, Kodai sends out a public message framing Zoroark as the culprit.  The Ledendary Pok&eacute;mon Celebi also becomes involved in this story.  Can Ash and his friends figure out what Kodai is up to and stop him before it's too late?

Once again, attempts were made to combine computer graphics with traditional animation.  Unfortunately, the CG stands out just as badly, if not a little worse, than in previous films in the Pok&eacute;mon franchise.  As I watched this film with my children, at least one of kids kept cracking jokes about the bad computer animation.  The musical score is rather similar to what has been heard in previous Pok&eacute;mon films; since I enjoyed the music in the earlier films, I also enjoyed hearing the pieces in this film.

When it comes to the actual story of the film, I thought there was the potential for a decent story; however, the execution was a little on the weak side.  I found that this film had a harder time keeping my interest than many of the earlier films in the franchise.  At this point in the franchise, it feels as if the director is relying more on a formula when producing the films.  This film runs for an hour and a half, but I think the film may have been a little on the long side for the story it was trying to tell.  My youngest child got really fidgety after we hit the one hour mark; perhaps a runtime of 70-80 minutes would have been a little better.

Zoroark Master of Illusions was released as a single disc DVD.  On the disc, you can watch the film, use the setup menu to choose if you want to have English subtitles and which English audio option you want, and you can choose where in the film you want to start watching.  When it comes to the subtitles, this disc includes a way to turn them off in the menu if your player decides to default to showing the English subtitles.

Like the previous three DVD releases of the Pok&eacute;mon films, Zoroark Master of Illusions does not include any special features.  Personally, I would recommend buying a copy of Zoroark Master of Illusions if you can find it somewhere that's selling it for under $15.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD through the King County Library System.",1327363200,7,3550,4.705024311183144

But Pokemon movies 1 to 9 and then this are all great films for all ages! Zoroark is an amazing epic pokemon with power and Zorura is a sneaky but cute little pokemon. The amount of graphics are so amazing and possibly CG. When it shows Suicune running with water behind it, it looks like real water.

This is the first film to present all three of the legendary beasts in one film, Entei, Suicune and Raikou. It even shows the Shiny versions of them. A great film that will go in my top favs of pokemon films!",1317254400,15,701,4.223880597014926

6282969,5,B004QM8JQU,"When Pokemon first came out in America, I was 10. It was perfect, since Ash was supposed to be 10 in the series as well. Obviously, as a kid, this was a great first connection to draw me in, as I'm certain it was intended to do. So, as a very long time Pokemon fan of the games and anime/manga series, I give this animated movie my 100% seal of approval. I'm a big Zorua/Zoroark fan, which drew me right away.

Firstly, the film has a certain amount of shared techniques and approaches towards the storytelling as other films, which is not a bad thing. What I like is that it does feel like a distinct storyline. It's not a matter of the world ending, but instead is a story of rather twisted and immoral villain using any means to achieve his ends. I was quite angry throughout the film, but in a good way. I say this, because the villain they wrote was completely rotten and what he does makes you want to jump into the film and try to stop their plans yourself. Some of the things they do range from mean, to cruel, to downright shocking. One of the scenes (which I won't spoil) I was both glad to see them push the limits of, but also surprised it made it in. It brought out the darker side of the series that the games (and Japanese mangas in particular) show, that usually doesn't come even close to making it in the anime.

As far as quality is concerned, I really appreciated the blend of traditional Pokemon animation with the higher quality CG effects. It came together quite well. Naturally, the music and voice acting was on par with pretty much any great Pokemon film or episode, so when it comes to the actual film from a technical perspective, it certainly leaves nothing out.

Lastly, Zorua is downright adorable, and in the film they did a great job of showing the characters as they should be. One thing (psuedo spoiler, I guess?) is that Zorua uses a form of telepathy to communicate. Seems pretty obvious that it was for the sake of making the movie easier to go through, having another Pokemon that can speak human language provides easier understanding and storytelling.

All in all, it's a pretty solid flick. I certainly got quite attached to Zorua and Zoroark, and got my heartstrings yanked on the whole time. A couple of the scenes reminded me of when I saw the very first Pokemon film in theatres, and I'm very happy that their ability to convey a great story hasn't weakened in the least. Absolutely recommending!",1409443200,,2442,4.456375838926174

6282971,4,B004QM8JQU,It's quite a good movie but the voice over is awful. I recommend getting the original Japanese if you're into that kind of anime.,1394496000,,129,4.416666666666667
6282972,5,B004QM8JQU,"I've loved Pokemon ever since it first came out when I was wee little girl back in the day and I can say without a doubt I still am a hard core Pokemon fanatic. I admit though, there are some movies made for the franchise that are amazing and some that are...not so much but it could also come down to favorites as well.

Zoroark and Zorua have become my favorite Pokemon of all time and I found this movie to not only be entertaining to watch (and held my attention throughout the film which is NO small feat when it comes to me) but also an emotional rollercoaster ranging from 'Awws' to flat out hatred towards the bad guy (which is how it should be!) to tearing up and crying, even cheering for Ash and company to prevail...even when I know they will, this movie pulled me in still!

Yes, there's a LOT of Pokemon cruelty in this film but in my opinion it's a subject that's sad but true in not only our world but also in the Pokemon world (The Pokemon world is a parallel to ours AS THE CREATORS WANT IT TO BE) and not only is cruelty shown here, its also shown in the games and even the anime show! Anyone remember the first season where a trainer dumped Charmander  for being too 'weak' and left it to die in the rain!? Yeah, this has been touched upon before in the series, no one went ape s*** about that back then and they shouldn't do it now 'just because these are newer' is not a reason to hate on it! I like it!

Why? Because it helps to teach children, our NEXT GENERATION that people who are cruel and devious do these things to innocent creatures for their own personal gain and should be fought against! We should cherish our world and every living thing in it and to stop evil and greed from consuming all we know and love and is real endeavor to fight for, it's worth the battle! So humbug on anyone hating on this movie for that reason only, open your mind to what the film is trying to subtly teach to those watching, if it wasn't made that way you wouldn't become as attached to the Pokemon suffering! You wouldn't want to jump into the TV to join Ash & company and their quest to make things right! The Pokemon are FAR from ignorant and know who are the good humans to the bad! Anyway...

The story is great, some Pokemon movies seem to lack the ability to draw me in at times but this one managed to suck me in completely, my only complaint about it would be the CGI parts, they really end up knocking me out of the film because they look so out of place. Yes CGI has been in Pokemon films from the very beginning and they try to hide it but, maybe because of budget issues, time constraints or that machines aren't really their best strength when drawing it all out (though I doubt it since I've seen motorcycles and cars drawn out) I just ignore it as it seems only the larger, vehicles, mostly airborne ones are made in CGI (the Beautilfies in beginning of this movie are also CGI but they tried to hide it...sort of) I'm not going to hold it against the movies overall rating since it's sort of something someone who has seen all the movies would expect to see at least once.

All in all, if you're looking for a newer Pokemon movie to watch I would greatly suggest this one if not as a must have than at least as a must see and let you be the judge from there!",1394409600,,3290,4.181388012618297
6282973,5,B004QM8JQU,"All I can say is that my girlfriend (who's a huge fan of Pokemon) gave me this movie. Basically, if you like Pokemon at all and you haven't seen this movie, then make sure you get it! It's a very heartwarming and touching story, and I assure you that it worth seeing at least twice!",1377561600,,282,4.1454545454545455
6282974,5,B004QM8JQU,"At first I was skeptical about this movie due to some of the comments I read but after actually watching it, I was impressed. I been never felt upset with any pokemon movies and wasn't upset with this one either. The movie does become kind of sad due to how they treat Zoroark and it gives you an angry feeling but in the end Zoroark overcomes the bad guys! The song at the end really stuck to me as well. Defitnitly a great movie to watch!!",1377302400,2,441,4.1395348837209305

6282982,1,B004QM8JQU,"Sorry, but the Pokemon Crew just went too far with this one.  Actually, the Pokemon films have been getting more violent, and the villians WORSE every year.  Unfortunately, FIGHTING has always been a big part of Pokemon.  You learn to catch Pokemon as a kid, and you train them to fight in staged battles agains other Pokemon...FOR FUN?  Whose fun?  Really!  As a card game, I can sort of accept this, and with Battrio video games, it does get exciting and challenging...but the big battles on the TV shows have always really bothered me, and the villians in the movies have been some of the most wicked people one can ever imagine.  (Do children, let alone adults need this?????)  Forget all their names, but the villians in all the films are horrible.  I just do not enjoy many of the movies at all because of them.  And our villian in THIS movie is just THE WORST.  He uses a pshycic Pokemon to  make Zoroark think his kid (Zorau) (sp?) is being tortured...NOT FUN TO WATCH.  Zoruaku is maniputaled, and caused SO MUCH agony by the villian.  He has those fake versions of the other Pokemon cause SO much horrible damage, and he had, and contiues to torture Celebi...I was so glad to get out of that Theatre, and will NEVER watch this Pokemon moive ever again.  By the way, except for the battles, I am a HUGE Pokemon fan, and have an enormous collection of Pokemon things.  But the movies have not been up on my list, and this one is certainly the most violent, and worst.  And even the Pokemon Crew realized this!  Not sure if was feedback from parents, or children, or who, but the next Pokemon movie (2011) had NO VILLIAN AT ALL!  The King was misinformed of some tradition, and sort of accidently used Victimi in a not very good way, but had thought he was doing what he was supposed to do.  Ash of course straightened him out, and the King realized his mistake (won't spoil any more of the plot).  And the new movie (2012) not only has NO VILLIAN, it barely has any humans!  It is story of Pokemon living amongst themselves.  I do not quite understand yet exactly all that happened, why Kelodi had to go and fight the dragon, but he sort of had to, to join some Pokemon club, or whatever.  NO VILLIAN at all.  So even the Pokemon Crew realized they had really pushed the violence envelope a bit too far with THIS 2010, Zoroark moive.  Skip it.",1345593600,,2351,4.421911421911422
6282983,4,B004QM8JQU,"This movie was an interesting one. Zoroark: Master of Illusions had a pretty good storyline, action was good, special effects weren't too bad, etc. The movie did a good job showcasing the newest Pokmon from the Unova region.

The ""illusions"" part of the movie is really fun, and there are several of my favorite legendaries in this film as well. There's a pretty clever villain and a nice mix of action and drama. The movie starts off quickly and doesn't waste time getting into the story.

8643731,3,B004QM8JQU,"Zoroark: Master of Illusions is the fourth movie in the Diamond & Pearl series although its completely separate from the previous trilogy. Its also one of the very few Pokemon movies not based around a legendary Pokemon. The other obvious non legendary star was Lucario from Lucario and the Mystery of Mew although Lucario shared billing with the legendary Mew. Ash and crew come across an illusion wielding Zorua who can take on the appearance of other Pokemon as well as humans. The plot is rather convoluted with the villain trying to scare everyone out of Crown City using the illusion powers of Zoroark in order to get ahold of Celebi in order to augment precognition powers that he already possesses.

This is not a bad movie but it feels like a major step down from the previous three. There are some neat moments as when Zoroark imitates the three Legendary Beasts, Entei, Suicune and Raikou and attacks Crown City but overall I found this film forgettable. In fact, Im reviewing this after my second viewing and I barely remember much of anything from my first viewing several years ago. I also don't think the animation was anywhere near what I saw in the Diamond/Pearl trilogy. Whats interesting is that this film was a FAR bigger financial hit in Japan than the previous three films. On the other hand, its the lowest rated of the Diamond/Pearl films on IMDB by a smidge so perhaps there were extenuating circumstances on why Zoroark made so much money.

This film kinda bored me but other than the convoluted plot I cant really point to anything that I thought was terrible. Other people may feel differently and love it. I admit Zoroark is a pretty cool design for a Pokemon.",1491782400,,1689,4.702702702702703
