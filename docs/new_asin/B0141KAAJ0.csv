8729293,3,B0141KAAJ0,I bought this because I'm a big fan of Big Time Wrestling. The matches are all in color. The quality for most of the matches is very good. The match with Abdullah The Butcher starts somewhere in the middle. At the end of another match another segment flickers in for a second and stops. There is no transition between matches. Sometimes they abruptly stop and the video goes black then another match starts. The final match between The Sheik and Mark Lewin stops before it is finished. A graphic is put up saying not all matches during the 1970's and 1980's were recorded from beginning to end. Some of the words in this graphic were even spelled wrong. The cover of the dvd says there are 16 matches. There are only 14. The audio is also out of synch in spots were you see the announcers talking. It would have been nice to include dates and places where and when these matches took place. Very poor editing. Fun for the nostalgia.,1498176000,,932,4.456140350877193

8729299,5,B0141KAAJ0,"Another classic from these guys. Big time wrestling was a great promotion and can't wait for #2. They show a variety of name wrestlers based off their hit TV show including the Shiek which is in two matches. The quality is good and when you consider most of it is 40 years old then its great. I see others criticize some of the quailty on other releases by these guys and I think wow, keep them coming and don't listen to them I mean its great to have this line of releases. Please keep them coming. The Funks, The Shiek, Bobo Brazil, and many more....",1455062400,,552,4.266666666666667
8729300,3,B0141KAAJ0,"Before there was the media blitz of the 1980s in wrestling with Cyndi Lauper, Mr. T, Muhammad Ali and Liberace, there was what many call the golden age of professional wrestling. Before the million dollar budgets, fanfare and pyro. It was all about men getting in a squared circle and facing off man-a-mano.

In the 1970s there was a promotion based in Detriot known as Big Time Wrestling and this promotion boasted of some the greats in the history of wrestling. This new release features 16 matches from the glory days of Big Time Wrestling.

The two hour program features legends of wrestling such as Abdullah the Butcher, Austin Idol, Haystacks Calhoun Bobo Brazil and the great Dory Funk Jr. The main event of this program features a rare Mark Lewin vs. The Shiek encounter.

The quality of the matches on this DVD are a little less the spectacular, but when you think about the fact that in this era a lot of production companies were not saving copies of their programs because they didn't see how they could make money with them later. So copies did not survive.

All in all this is a nice little collection of a time capsule of wrestling from many years ago. So if you are a fan of classic wrestling pick up this collection. Head over to[...] or your local video provider and pick this one up today!

8729301,1,B0141KAAJ0,Very dissapointed in this video. They implied that this video is about the Sheik and his matches in Big Time Wrestling. The quality of the video is terrible and it's very poorly done. There was no thought to putting this DVD together as the matches where not of much significance with a lot of lower card talent. Audio was just terrible and it's a shame because this is a legendary promotion with a lot of great matches that they could have shown.,1453766400,,447,4.463414634146342
