8382232,4,B002VKB6VY,"""Love + Hate"" is a modern day Romeo and Juliet love story. Writer and director Dominic Savage, successfully adapts the theme of the two star-crossed lovers, torn between the love for each other and the ties to their families. Placing them in an unfortunate ultimatum in which they must choose, one or the other.

The pair of British actors who play the Romeo and Juliet of this story, have superb chemistry on screen. Taking into account that the film is set in the metropolitian area of Liverpool, the actors have accents that match as such. The dialect creates instant audience likability, although takes a keen listener to comprehend. I adored the innocent attraction, and subtle flirtation the two characters shared. The viewer is rooting for their relationship to succeed, however is confronted with the question, ""at what cost?""

I didn't rate this film 5/5 because at the climax of the tension between the families, it became unbearable to watch. I didn't actually finish the movie until a couple days later, when I was compelled to have resolution. Also, I believe the scenes of sexuality between the secondary characters could have been cut completely. I don't believe they were at all necessary for further development of the plot.

On a final note, if the viewer is a fan of heartbreaking, romantic films such as Titanic, Romeo + Juliet, A Walk to Remember, Tristan and Isolde, or Becoming Jane, then they should definitely consider watching this film!",1263513600,2,1463,4.963265306122449

The day it vanished from the onDemand menu was one of the saddest days of my young life.  And now I can't even find it on DVD. I just don't understand why it can't be available in America! I mean, don't they want people from outside the UK to buy it?! I love love LOVE this film!!! I hope eventually it does make it to usa compatible dvd format :D",1251676800,,474,4.075268817204301
8382234,4,B002VKB6VY,"I am just upset that i can not get this dvd on a region 1 setting. I would love to buy this movie, i first saw it on the sundance channel and when i saw it again, i recorded it on a vhs tape.
They need to put it on a region 1 so a broader audience would be able to see it",1247702400,,271,3.3174603174603177
8382235,5,B002VKB6VY,"This movie was the greatest movie I've ever seen. I've watched it over 10x and I'm still not over it. The acting was fantastic, the relationships felt 100% real. The music was perfect for every scene, and all the singers were great. I really enjoyed how the romance was sweet, but not disturbingly so. All in all the best Romance movie for those who don't really like Sappy-sweet movies.",1218153600,,387,4.6231884057971016
8382236,4,B002VKB6VY,"This a beautiful take on the Romeo and Juliet story...the intimacy of the characters makes for a very special story.  The actors are terrific on all levels and make each one of their characters seem like someone you know.  The music fits every scene and helps to set the tone of that moment while describing the feelings that are being aroused by both the characters and the audience.  It's simple, humble and classic filmmaking with two intelligent characters realizing who they want to be and deciding if they have the guts to follow their heart...One of my fave movies of 05 and I can't wait to get it into the US (properly formatted) for DVD",1198540800,,645,4.591304347826087
