Just be aware that this and some of the other FIRM DVDs put out have worn out fast.  I used Super Cardio approximately once a week for the last four months. I keep my DVDs in a case where they are protected and do not rub up against other DVDs. There are no visible scratches on the DVD whatsoever. However, after ""sticking"" on a particular frame in places since about a month after purchasing, it now will not pause at all onscreen. It also will not go forward to the next scene or flip back to the beginning of the chapter with my arrow buttons on the remote. Nor does it budge if I go to the DVD player itself and hit the buttons on the front panel. The same problem existed in my portable DVD player, too, so it wasn't my player acting up. If I get a sip of water or need a second to put away a piece of workout equipment, I cannot pause the DVD now! I have to go to the menu and manually select the next scene from the menu. Very aggravating when you're trying to keep the heart rate up during a cardio workout. I have no kids or anything that get into my DVDs and scratch them up or anything. I've had this happen with four or five different FIRM workouts now. Whether that is just the nature of DVDs one uses as often as once a week or so, I don't know, but my VHS tapes lasted a lot longer than this! Disappointing. Wish they were all available in digital format instead...",1421193600,2,1477,4.146341463414634
