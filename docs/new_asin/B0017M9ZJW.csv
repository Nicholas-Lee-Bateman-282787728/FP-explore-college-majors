8266638,5,B0017M9ZJW,"It is truly amazing what the male of any specie will do for the attention/ affection of the ladies! After watching this movie there should be no question as to whom holds the power over whom & redefines the term ""weaker sex""!",1391904000,,225,4.380952380952381
8266639,5,B0017M9ZJW,I used this in my ecology class and my college students loved it.  Had all kinds of questions and insights to share after that with their classmates.  I even got them thinking about human mating displays at clubs and they thought that would huge fun the next time they went out.  The photography and info are good and the film is very informative.,1348963200,2,347,4.476190476190476
8266640,3,B0017M9ZJW,"This program acts like ""what females want"" and ""what males will do"" are two totally separate things.  However, what gets included where is somewhat arbitrary.  For example, peacocks were in the ""females"" half and lyre birds in the ""males"" half, but both males in the species show fancy plummage to attract mates.

The documentary may be using the ""sugar and spice"" versus ""snakes and snails"" method.  The ""females"" half showed more mammals and birds while the ""males"" half showed more insects, reptiles, and spiders.

In the ""females"" installment, they still shows male animals being more active.  It wasn't like a human woman saying ""Whoever can run a marathon and earn a Ph. D. can have me!""  The documentary still shows a lot of male activity and female passivity.  Further, when females are doing an act, it came up in the ""males"" section.  They shows animals that can take in different males' goo and later choose which sample it'll use.  This work is fascinating in terms of non-monogamy as well.  I think we humans assume men will be more promiscuous.  However, this work speaks of female animals that reproduce with one male but use another male to care for the young.  Male animals killed by female sex partners are shown in the ""males"" half, but it can be asked, ""Don't some females WANT to copulate and eat consecutively or concurrently?""

The work also focuses on study methods.  Scientists get to show how their work is novel or eye-opening.  This work shows process over results in many instances.

One researcher said, ""Look at how [human] women prefer the guy in the tuxedo over the [human] man in jeans.""  There could be more comparisons than that.  This program speaks a lot about male animals singing, dancing, or playing an instrument.  This may vary by culture, but many human females have romantic or sexual preferences for males that perform well in those three areas.",1286841600,3,1891,4.85
