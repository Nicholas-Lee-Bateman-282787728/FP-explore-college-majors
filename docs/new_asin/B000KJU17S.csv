8157635,1,B000KJU17S,Not the Jim Norton I know and love. This movie was weird and awful,1467849600,,66,3.7857142857142856
8157636,2,B000KJU17S,"A down on his luck bar owner and a collection of his misfits friends plot a hair-brained scheme to rip off a local post office.  Among those friends is an old lady with massive bingo wings, a guido who probably flunked out of the 8th grade, and Jim Norton, the reason most people watched this low budget excuse for a movie.  Norton's stupid face receives very little screen time, and he's given even less time to unleash the crude jokes on which he's built a modest career and a rabid following.

Putting Norton on the cover is disingenuous at best, since his performance is so understated and far from a comedy routine that includes disturbed quips about Dakota Fanning.  Very disappointed.  This is obviously low budget and the actors are below average.  The reason to watch it is Norton, and he's restrained to the point of boredom.  Watch a few Comedy Central roasts instead; you'll get more comedy.

8157637,1,B000KJU17S,"I purchased this DVD at Ted's Crappy DVD & Cotton Ball Emporium.  My favoritest lil fella in the world, Dr. James Norden, doesn't have anywhere near as big of a part in this movie as you'd think, considering he's on the front cover of the DVD.  Hopefully, he's at least getting a few pennies from the sales, so that he can continue his treatments.",1228003200,,347,4.40625
8157638,5,B000KJU17S,Norton was funny with his acting.  I bought this movie just to see him.  The rest of the characters were good also.,1216512000,,115,4.181818181818182
8157639,5,B000KJU17S,"Having had the pleasure of helping out behind the scenes on this movie while it was being filmed in Bayonne, as well as being an actress who has experience both behind and in front of the camera, I tend to view movies in a most different way, especially having seen first-hand what kind of work went into this film, as well as having the opportunity to see the finished product. ""Crooks,"" in my own eyes, is a purely wonderful piece of work and I would definitely suggest this movie to others.",1202428800,,493,4.428571428571429
