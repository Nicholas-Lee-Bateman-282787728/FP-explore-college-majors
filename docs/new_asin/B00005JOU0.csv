1607639,1,B00005JOU0,"well, unless she continues with projects like this. She's done some great work on Veronica Mars! but this won't be the highlight of her career, that's for sure. Pulse has a re-used plot, the scares are laughable, not that much makes sense. when u see the laundry get thrown out of the dryer, it's laughable instead of scary. the whole movie is a complete joke, it's brainless, the acting is sub-par, it's gore-free pretty much & in ways it's better that way but the plot is just so ridiculous that you just can't believe that this is actually happening. Pulse was an attempt to scare the audience but fails in every aspect of a true horror film. Kristen Bell, well I just thank God she Veronica Mars! otherwise, her acting career would've been over before it started. as for the rest of the cast, they'd be lucky to end up with a job at McDonald's, part-time.",1155945600,2,859,4.512820512820513
1607640,2,B00005JOU0,"I had high hopes for Pulse. I really did.  I loved the quiet subtlety and surreal creepiness of Kairo, the Japanese original, and thought the remake could only make a good thing better.  Boy, was I wrong.

With the exception of a few key scenes lifted directly from the original(the woman walking in slowmo, the girl distengrating into ash, the crashing plane), the American remake does not resemble Kairo at all.

One of the key complaints of Pulse is that the plot is disjointed and ambiguous.  Kairo, the Japanese version, is even more ambiguous.  Nothing is explained at all: the websites, the red tape, the spirits.  The ambiguity of the plot added an extra element of creepiness, almost as if this was happening to you and you have no idea why.  It also left the plot up to your own interpretation and had a fairly bleak ending (which I liked).  Essentially, the plot to Kairo is the afterlife is finite and souls have nowhere to go so they use modern technology to manifest themselves in the real world by causing the living to become depressed and suicidal.

With the remake Pulse, the ambiguity of the plot combined with the over explanation of everything that happens results in a jumbled mess with lukewarm scares. The souls are changed into evil spirits wanting human lifeforce. A weird computer virus is introduced and more characters were added which did nothing to further the story.  The psychiatrist character annoyed me to no end, the dream sequences were pointless and if I'm not mistaken the scene when the person jumps off the tower was completely cut (another scene lifted from Kairo).  I liked the gray and blue lighting reminiscent of The Ring remake but everything was grungy and dirty. Apartments were dark and dusty, bathrooms were mildewy and grimy.  The special effects were excellent but were squandered away on a poorly written and badly acted movie. It was more entertaining watching the group of kids in front of me react to the movie than it was watching the movie.  There were even unintentional moments of humor that had me and my friend laughing out loud for minutes on end.

There ought to be a law that prevents Hollywood from ever remaking another Japanese horror movie again. Overall, Pulse left me so disappointed.  It truly let me down and I really, really did want to like it.  Wait for video or better yet rent the original.",1155772800,5,2369,4.739024390243903
1607641,2,B00005JOU0,"""The Grudge"", like this film a remake of a Japanese horror movie, helped Sarah Michelle Gellar convince skeptics that she could make the transition from small screen to large.  This movie might have done the same for Kristen Bell but, alas, it is not up to the standards (such as they are) of ""The Grudge"" or the Naomi Watts vehicle ""The Ring"".  The plot is jumbled, never fully explained, and more repulsive than scary.  As has become common in horror movies, the entire film (either through lighting or film-processing) appears as if shot under flourescent lamps that wash out colors and are extremely unflattering to the actors; every tiny imperfection of the flesh is exaggeratedly clear and distinct.  The actors' makeup hides nothing yet is itself grotesquely obtrusive.  Kristen Bell can surely be more beautiful than this on the big screen.  She manages to project some of her intrinsic charm despite the obstacles, but it is overcome by the general dreariness.  The movie, supposedly set on campus in Columbus Ohio, seems to have been shot in some neo-Stalinist architectural hell, perhaps in Eastern Europe.  I'm sure Ohio State was never like this.  Until near the end there are only four or five locations among which the movie cycles repetitively back and forth in a distinctly low-budget manner.  So . . . order season 2 of ""Veronica Mars"" on DVD and hope for a better opportunity for Kristen next time round.",1155686400,10,1423,4.891666666666667
1607642,3,B00005JOU0,"This is my Department but Along the lines of horror......

Lets see ,

Well the movies has an ok kind of first beat to it.

With the good also comes the bad,

I liked the movie but it kinda seemed a little too drawn out.

More or less a lotta talking so people who cant stand to be patient

to follow the story should probably stay away or they might fall

asleep.

Aside from the Bad I liked the horror or freak factor parts in the

movie they can make you jump, so if your in for a quick boost out

of your seat you might wanna check it out.

All in all its an ok average movie but the hype that they put

into selling it im not sure if it really lives up to its own

pulse.

1607643,2,B00005JOU0,"DOA - Good premise, but horrible acting and even worse direction. The actors are as monochrome as they come. Only gets two stars because of the special effects. Don't waste your money.",1155600000,,184,4.78125
1607644,1,B00005JOU0,"Based on the Japanease version KAIRO, this thriller centers a group of college students who discover that a computer hacker unwittingly pirated a strange wireless signal that opens a doorway for evil spirits to cross over into the world. The evil spreads like a virus, and the students must race to find a way to stop it. As dreary and dark as it was, the movie has no sense of the word scary. And humiliates itself with boredom and gloominess. And has us laughing whenever a scary part occured. Even though the movie had the potential of being good, it failed to do so in a non scary, repulsive way that makes us all wonder why it was created in the first place.",1155427200,5,663,4.3983739837398375
1607645,1,B00005JOU0,"What this movie had going for it:

1.) Good CGI and cinematography

What it didn't have:

1.) Suspense - no buildup at all; it jumps right into the climactic conclusion from moment one.

2.) Character development - none!  Just people you know nothing about dissolving into black ooze.  Even the Jason and Freddy Krueger movies did a better job of making you care about the victims.  All you know about these people is that they sleep around and like to hack into computers.

3.) Good acting - self-explanatory; none of the cast members are likely to have an Academy Award in their future.

4.) A coherent plot - if the ghosts are dependent on the communications network, then why don't they disappear after the infrastructure collapses?  Only one of many silly blunders.

It short it was like so many other films these days - a paper thin story used to showcase cool special effects.  Think ""Van Helsing"" and ""The Ring 2.""  PURE CRAP.",1155340800,3,934,4.656441717791411
1607646,2,B00005JOU0,"okay, i am a HUGE horror movie fan. and this actually looked pretty scary, even though i knew it wasn't going to be AMAZING. IT WAS TERRIBLE!!! i saw it with people who get scared very very easily, and even they said it sucked. it had no story, was not scary AT ALL, so i really don't recommend this",1155340800,3,299,4.084745762711864
1607647,5,B00005JOU0,"Now, THIS is a scary film! I didn't have high hopes for this one, thinking that it wouldn't live up to the Japanese version it remakes. But I was pleasantly surprised to find Pulse a vastly entertaining horror flick; it contains taut pacing, a dense, ominous atmosphere, and a spookily rendered unveiling of its horror elements. I relished its against-all-odds, apocalyptic flavor. The premise, that of malevolent ghosts accessing the real world via our rapidly advancing communications technology, is an update (upgrade?) on the that age-old plot of spirits affecting us from beyond the grave. And when done with panache, great energy and earnest concerted effort by cast and crew - like in Pulse - it's a thing of horrific beauty.

Pulse is the remake of the Japanese horror movie Kairo, directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa (Cure, Charisma, and Bright Future).  Kurosawa is known for eschewing obvious, traditional shock values and opting instead for an introspective, somewhat withdrawn, and unsettling style which seeps into the head and burrows under the skin. His favorite themes have to do with disaffection, the immersion or loss of identity, and how society ultimately affects us as individuals. Pulse, the American version, of course, dumbs it down enough for the mass consumers and somewhat reduces Kurosawa's film into a less contemplative but still exhilaratingly frightening boo-fest. Having said that, Wes Craven, who is credited with the American adaptation, does find sequences in the film to insert several searing images to reiterate Kurosawa's thoughtful conceits. Interspered throughout the horror are quick touches on the themes of desolation, alienation, our over-dependence on machines, and the individual loss of identity thru submergence in technology. Viewers of Kairo will, I believe, find this version rewarding and entertaining, even if, ultimately, it's from a common denominator level.

This film echoes The Ring in the depiction of its pale, grainy, pixel-challenged apparitions, and The Terminator in its apocalyptic, end-of-the-world tone. From the opening shot, Pulse is in ""boo"" mode and consistently stays so for the entire film. The scares come fast and often, and while most of the set-ups are seen a mile away, the payoffs are nevertheless big and unnerving. I agree that the laundry room scene and the ghost car attack are damned intense. There's a scene involving a friend breaking into Josh's apartment and also a bathtub scene that I thought were pretty spooky.

The actors are laudable. The star is obviously Kristen Bell (she of Veronica Mars fame), who plays Mattie; and she nicely carries the film. Her supporting cast also does a good job of keeping it down to earth, yet, when the scene calls for it, is able to reveal stark fear, without going over the top. Christina Milian as Mattie's best bud Izzy is endearing and sexy hot in her low hung jeans. Jonathan Tucker as the tortured Josh is particularly effective in his eerieness. The always reliable Ron Rifkin (Alias) has a small appearance as Mattie's psychologist. Ian Somerhalder, in my eyes, is decent as the stubbled Dexter.

This is an excellent movie to take your buddies and is even a better date movie (I guarantee arms will be grabbed and crushed in vise-like grips many times, if you're into that). A friend of mine, in the midst of screening Pulse, started wondering about the ghosts' motivations and raison d'etre (""so they suck your life out, and then what?""). I slapped him on the head with a popcorn bucket. When a movie is this terrifyingly entertaining, you can forgive it a lapse or two, no? Four and a half stars.",1155340800,8,3630,5.083892617449664
1607648,4,B00005JOU0,"A very noticeable feature of ""Pulse"" is its consistently monochromatic color scheme; every shot is drenched in grainy, unpleasing shades of blue and gray. It gave the film quite a surreal quality, as if it were filmed with an obsolete form of celluloid. What a perfect look for a horror movie, especially for one that revolved around computer technology and online video feeds. It works even better when a series of cyberspace ghosts are added to the mix. We never get a real sense of what they look like (which I found effective), but based on some very distinct glimpses, I gathered that they're pale, grayish figures, and they flicker in and out of our world like random computer glitches. Their presence gave legitimacy to the moody visuals, and that made the movie much more entertaining. I also enjoyed the dialogue; it remained true to horror movies without getting hokey. And no wonder; the screenplay was co-written by Wes Craven, a true master at creating believable dialogue.

In the tradition of films like ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge,"" ""Pulse"" is an American remake of a Japanese horror movie. ""Kairo""--released in 2001 and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa--was just as much a social statement as it was a supernatural thriller, focusing on isolation in the midst of a highly technological world. This emphasis on humanity could be one of the reasons why the American version was at times is a little difficult to follow; it was as if certain things were purposely meant to be ambiguous, despite the fact that the audience is dying to know what the hell is going on. Spirits are entering the world of the living via the Internet, evil spirits that supposedly want life again. Even though their motive is not exactly crystal clear, we are given enough of an explanation to keep us from lapsing into total confusion.

It all starts when one of the ghosts attacks a college student named Josh (Jonathan Tucker). He had been wandering around a school library looking for someone named Douglas Zieglar (Kel O'Neill). Why he was attacked and what he wanted with Zieglar is unknown. All anyone does know is that he's now acting incredibly strange. Mattie (Kristen Bell) had been worried about him for days; not only has he not been returning her calls, he also leaves a single, ominous message on her answering machine. When she decides to see him, she fails to grasp why he's become so detached and why his apartment is in shambles. Papers are all over the floor. Dust and dirt coat everything. The food in the refrigerator is covered with maggots. There's even a dying cat in his closet (why this had to be included is beyond me). He ultimately commits suicide right in front of Mattie, which understandably leaves her angry, confused, and scared. Luckily, her friends--Izzie (Christina Milian), Stone (Rick Gonzales), and Tim (Sam Levine)--are all there to support her.

One night, while sending each other instant messages over the Internet, someone with the screen ID ""Josh"" repeatedly sends each of these characters a message saying, ""Help me."" Initially unwilling to accept this as a supernatural occurrence, Mattie attempts to locate Josh's computer and find out who's behind the message. She tracks it down to a man named Dexter McCarthy (Ian Somerhalder), a gruff-looking loner type. During their meeting, Mattie discovers two things: 1) the computer is not even plugged in, and 2) it's still in the trunk of Dexter's car.

That's when all the bad things start to happen, not just to the main characters, but to all of the American public, as well. The news continually reports a massive rise in suicides, none of which seem to be connected. But when Dexter opens Josh's hard drive, things start falling into place. It contains scores of video captures, all of which don't reveal too much to the audience other than some cryptic, disturbing imagery. We're led to believe that they're videos of people killing themselves. However, we never actually see it happen; what we do see are blank, expressionless faces, ones that seem genuinely tired of living. We also see the blurry image of a ghost in the background, hinting at some kind of possession. But the fact is that we don't really know what's going on; death is only insinuated, not spelled out for us.

Still, the videos are effectively creepy in their simplicity; they each had a distinctly underground feel to them, as if a snuff website had been hacked into. What makes them even creepier is that they somehow get sent to everyone's computer, each time preceded by the question, ""Would you like to meet a ghost?"" When the link is clicked, the videos play, giving the ghosts access to our world. They then attack anyone in their path, sucking the will to live directly out of their bodies.

The only thing that seems to keep these spirits at bay is special red tape, first seen covering the windows and door of Josh's bedroom. Three days before he died, he sent Mattie a three-pack of the stuff through the mail. Attached was a note saying, ""It keeps them out. Don't know why."" Maybe it interferes with their frequency. Maybe it's too strong to let electronic signals penetrate it.

Maybe I'm analyzing the specifics too deeply; all that matters is that the tape is the one and only method of protection. (Did anyone but me see the connection to duct tape and a nuclear attack?) And people are going to need a lot of it. That's because the ghosts are spreading everywhere, and it's all because they can travel through a computer signal. The cities are no longer safe, and panic inevitably ensues. Ultimately, the survivors are forced to flee towards technology-free areas called dead zones (which is a fancy name for an undeveloped area). Only one hope remains: a computer virus that Josh had been developing. If Dexter and Mattie can locate Zieglar and upload the virus into their city's hard drive, things just might go back to normal.

Will they succeed? I obviously can't say, and I'm sure most people won't find that aspect of the story interesting. However, the fact that this remake is also making a social statement can't be easily overlooked. Technology is very much the enemy in this story; the ghosts use it purely as a means of control and domination over those that are living. The symbolism in ""Pulse"" is in no way subtle. Granted, the message it's giving isn't exactly new. But the way it's given certainly is, and I think that's what I liked the most about it. Yes, it seems like an average, meaningless horror movie on the surface, but underneath, I think it's actually trying to say something.

However, it's open for debate whether or not it's trying to say something important. It may not be saying anything at all; maybe it truly is just a meaningless horror film, solely created to scare the audience. ""Pulse"" doesn't leave you with definite answers, even when explanations are given. The plot is a mixture of pop out scares, psychological analyses, and technological phobias, all of which initially seem incompatible but eventually come together nicely. If it weren't for the fact that there's no gore, sex, or nudity, I could say that there's something in it for every kind of horror movie fan. But that's all right; much like life, you have to take what's offered and make the best of it. This is a very adequate horror movie, and it's sure to please anyone looking for a decent ghost story.",1155254400,9,7384,4.79874213836478

Original film was too dark and tech too old to draw me in -- and this one, while not meriting 5-stars, did take the original concept and RUN with it, IMO.  The acting was good enough to elevate this film above low-budget horror by quite a bit.  Add to that very respectable special effects and this one held my interest.  Heavier on the sci-fi than the ghost genre, ultimately, and looks like it spawned a couple sequels.  For J-horror purists, this might not satisfy, but if you LIKE J-horror remakes, you ought to enjoy this one.  Not on par with The Ring or The Grudge but not MILES away either.  Recommended.

1608101,2,B00005JOU0,This movie did not make any sense at all. It was just all over the place. I did not like it at all. I would not recommend it. Don't waist your time.,1403222400,,148,3.65625
1608102,4,B00005JOU0,"I watched this after seeing the original Asian version after.

Now I LOVE horror, particularly supernatural/paranormal.  I don't really like the bloody stuff like Hostel or Texas Chainsaw Massacre--they [in my opinion] lack plot.  Now, back to Pulse.  I don't really know why it got such a low review.  It was filmed well, acting was good.  If I could pretend I hadn't seen the original, I might still think it was a little predictable but so is Stephen King.  I look for a good story, and I think this film had it.

People may slander this film because it isn't like the Asian version.  Unlike the Grudge, which I thought was pretty much a direct copy of Ju-On, this film is not.  For one, it is easier to understand than the Asian version.  The Asian version had far more plot lines/characters.  It also had a lot less dialogue and more cinematography? Is that what you call it when it seems like a bunch of photographs?  Visually pretty but the focus was not so much on the paranormal but on the feelings of the characters and unspoken thoughts--I liked it the first time but the second time it seemed too long and less like a paranormal and more like a character study.

I think that this film may be hit or miss for many.  People who want graphic violence, like Hostel, or a more in your face paranormal, like Insidious won't find that here.  And die hard loyalists who loathe the idea of a remake--well they probably won't like it either.

I did not give the film five stars because I reserve that for films that still unnerve me/scare me if I watch it multiple times.  Like IT.",1403136000,,1584,4.45993031358885

Then the person becomes haunted by a ghost. If the ghost comes in contact with the person, the person loses their will to live and they either kill themselves, or they turn into ash. In the movie, people in the city are dying one by one and the story focuses on a girl and her friend who are trying to find a way to stop the apocalypse from happening.

This movie remakes many scenes from the Japanese film, but changes most of the ending. If you decide to watch this movie, make sure you watch the UNRATED version, because that version has several scenes that are adapted from the Japanese film.

1608167,2,B00005JOU0,"Well, this remake is certainly as bleak as the original film was; they definitely got the DOOM part right.  But, as ghost stories go, this one didn't.  The whole concept of an invasion of spirits, using technology as their way into this world, is puzzling to say the least.  There are far easier ways to gain egress than waiting for someone to use their computer in just the manner needed to open the way.  I kept thinking, what was the theme of this movie anyway, misery loves company?  Why was the sole intent of these malevolent spirits to infect the living and make them want to die?  We can't have life anymore so no one else should have it either.  That seems a rather abstract purpose.  Say they got their way and everyone living is suddenly dead, now what?  As a plot, there's nowhere to go with this type of story.  And that's the problem with this movie, there's far too many question and precious little in the way of answers.  To start with, too much red tape.  Are these spirits traveling here via sound waves or light waves?  Technology gets the blame no matter what, that's a convenient scapegoat.  Technology/progress has always held a negative connotation by those who would rather we kept everything the same, always.  Using that thin thread of mistrust as a basis for a ghost story is patently ridiculous.  Is technology the new boogeyman?  There are certainly enough movies maintaining that it is.  For me, it's far scarier being without it than utilizing it on a daily basis to make life easier.
I just couldn't take this movie seriously.  To put it on a basic level, it just wasn't scary; it didn't offer anything fresh.  I don't fault the actors, just the premise.  A case of too much atmosphere and nothing else.",1351382400,,1736,4.58957654723127
1608258,4,B00005JOU0,"Usually American remakes of Asian films absolutely suck with very few exceptions and this remake of Pulse is one of those exceptions.
It is a completely different movie than the original and not as good but decent enough to be worthy of a rental. I would not recommend purchasing the movie on disc as one viewing will be all you will probably want. It is definitely not worth adding to a video library but is entertaining enough to watch once.
I enjoyed it a LOT more than I expected I would and it was definitely worth the price I paid to rent the thing from Amazon to have streamed to my television by my Roku Box.
I am not exactly one to rely on for favorable reviews so if I say this is worth renting I assure you that I am not simply being ""polite"", but am truly expressing my opinion of the movie. If you liked the American version of The Ring, you will like this as well. That movie was also one of the very rare exceptions to the American Film Industries inability to satisfactorily remake an Asian film as was Pulse.

If you've ever seen an 80s movie where the scenes take place in a smoke filled bar, then that is exactly what you are gonna be watching in this so called
""Stunning Hi Def 1080p transfer"".... Uh....Yeah...Right. Hi Def mosquito noise more like it, but if you like watching mosquito noise in HD, then this is for you.
If you've ever watched the Blu Ray of Predator then you know exactly what I'm talking about.

This is worse.

In my opinon there are no artifacts or ""jaggies"" like you get watching an upscaled dvd. So its actually above an upscaled 1080i dvd, but below a true 1080p BD.

The colors are flat, they are not bright, but the picture is sharp in the sense that there are no artifacts. Just that never ending cloud of smoke, mosquito noise etc.

Pulse is a film that seeks to exploit the technology crazed nature of recent generations. its plot revolves mainly around a large group of deaths centering around a college that seem connected somehow to a website where the victims commit suicide,live before a webcam. the plot is interesting at first but as the story unfolds, more and more plot holes give little incentive to care about the story or the characters. I found that the antagonist's weakness, red duct tape, to be both ridiculous and poorly thought out. the antagonists are never explained well and the way they ""cross over"" seems unrealistic and at this point in the story, there is little to tie into the earlier incidents. in fact, the entire story makes little sense and remains shallow and uninspired throughout.",1337558400,,909,4.9868421052631575

1608264,3,B00005JOU0,"What I liked about this movie was it made cell phones and other electronic devices the bad guys. I have always disliked the way cell phones and things like instant messages really divide people instead of bringing them together. Those commercials... where they brag about how they ""bring people together"" - using those exact words - and then show groups of people on a subway, waiting for a bus, hanging out on a basketball court... and none of them are paying attention to each other. They are all staring down at the little plastic device in their hand. Bring people together, ha! I'd laugh if it weren't so depressing.

I'd rather see a serious movie about the horrors of society instead of a horror movie about the horrors of society, but oh well. We need special effects to keep up entertained these days. Evil spirits coming through on channels opened by electronic devices doesn't have much to do with people being overly obsessed with their phones or other electronics, or being too dependent, or people using technology to make a fortune off of others at their expense... but it was an interesting idea. A very disturbing idea.

To tell you the truth, if Ian Somerhalder wasn't in this movie, I would not have bought it. This movie is also the full-screen edition. In my opinion ""Pulse"" is more of a suspense movie than a horror movie. I don't like scary movies at all so this works out great for me. I loved all of the actors in this movie. They are very believable. I was a little surprised at the end of the movie. Most movies go for the happy ever after, or you think the worst is over, but not this one. This movie also comes with special features. It has deleted and additional scenes, creating the fear: making ""Pulse"", the visual effects of ""Pulse"", ""Pulse"" and the paranormal, 2 feature commentaries with the filmmakers, theatrical trailer.

The only thing I really did not enjoy about the movie was that the characters were not developed very well. The cast members in this movie did a good job keeping up with the fright of the film but their individual characters were very static. The characters did not change much throughout the story and none of them brought too much to the story line that wouldn't have been there just with the basic plot. I wish we could have been able to see more of the characters and how they handled situations other than just how they freaked out when they got scared. I would not say that the acting is poor because I think the actors did well with what they had to play with, but I think that the story should have offered more development and insight into each character. Other than a character development flaw, I thought the film was pretty good. I would recommend it to people who like to be scared and don't mind static characters and a story that is similar to many that have been done before.

This film had a plot that could have been used differently, but since it wasn't, it really doesn't break a single mold. It basically is the mold. It's about a virus that breaks loose, causing anybody using electronic devices or anybody in a Wi-Fi area, to get their life sucked out of them from these-looking holographic-ish creatures, causing them to basically commit suicide. Maybe the film should have just been about contacting the dead through electronic devices. It sounds a bit better at least. The film did have some good and scary pop-outs though, but the whole story and ending, were really neurotic. It wasn't anything shocking. It was actually really dumb. Altogether, it was a pretty horrible movie. About as horrible as ""One Missed Call"", which I'm pretty sure even the original Japanese versions of both those movies are horrible, too, so I guess it doesn't really matter.

That it is the worst remake to come along in quite sometime, if not the overall worst film ever made, a huge disappointment and a waste of celluloid. Well, in over thirty years of watching horror movies, I'm here to tell you that I've seen far worse that are more deserving of such -ahem- praise. The tale is about Mattie who is in the next room when her boy friend, Josh, commits suicide which is happening alot on their college campus and in several other areas across the country. She and her remaining friends begin finding out about what's behind the suicides which are ghosts who are coming back to earth via electronic means and sucking the life force out of folks like Josh who happen to be accessing their computers, cell phones, PDAs, etc(anything electric). Mattie ends up meeting Dexter who newly owns Josh's computer. Both figure out that a guy named Ziegler is responsible for starting everything in the first place and that Josh was trying to fix the problem before hanging himself. That's, ultimately, when both can either save the world or let it be taken over by the ghosts. Sadly, this is where the movie falls and becomes a disappointment.

Personally, I thought the movie was alot better than some of the other drivel passing for American remakes of Japanese horror movies. Even though the finale was anti-climatic, it was still worth watching. Do I recommend it? Well, I'd recommend the original Kairo first...but yes.

1608333,2,B00005JOU0,"I saw PULSE (the ""unrated"" version) just 5 days ago, and I feel even now that I can hardly remember half of what happened in the film...so generic and uninteresting did it turn out to be.

The film has a promising premise.  Ghosts are using the internet to enter into our world, because they operate on a frequency that we've now been able to tune in to.  I like that...it's a clean, simple concept that could have gone in a million directions.  In PULSE, at least initially, it appears that the dead are someone able to infect those who encounter them online...essentially turning the living into death-craving half-zombies.  Basically, they compel their occupants to commit suicide.

This all gets kicked off when the boyfriend of college student Kristen Bell commits suicide, more or less in front of her.  Then various friends of hers do stupid things to get themselves killed as well, even though they figure out basically what is going on fairly early on.

This is one of those films where the low-budget has led the director into creating a world that isn't entirely recognizable.  The main characters are all college students (I think)...but they never go to class and none of them live in apartments or dorms.  They seem to prefer seedy loft-like spaces that have peeling paint, no lighting, moisture on the walls, etc.  There are virtually no adults in the film at all...only poor Ron Rifkin, who must have lost a bet and was forced to play the world's most ineffectual psychiatrist.  I presume he filmed his scenes with Bell in one day...and not a single moment of their time together adds anything to the film.

PULSE starts out as a horror story, but by the end, you realize it has morphed into a science fiction film...an apocalyptic one at that.  The concluding minutes of the film are so far removed in tone, scope and genre from the opening minutes that it is kind of flabbergasting how jarring it is.

In the early going, the film generates a few chilling moments.  Just the images of ghosts captured on the computer monitors are creepy, and the early scenes carry a sense of foreboding.  But these same mildly successful elements are almost literally repeated time and time again, to vastly diminishing returns each time.  The movie becomes tedious pretty quickly.

No one gives a particularly effective performance, mostly because the characters are almost utterly generic.  Bell gains no points with me for her efforts.  Ian Somerhalder (who was Boone on LOST) plays a computer geek, of sorts, who seems to become something akin to a love interested for Bell...but for no discernible reason.  He is also quite unbelievable in his role.  Samm Levine, a star of FREAKS AND GEEKS, turns up here, and that put a smile on my face until I realized this character was a complete cipher.

This film, perhaps, rises to the level of the low-budget films that make up the AFTER DARK HORRORFEST DVDs...horror films that couldn't muster up a theatrical release.  It feels cheap.  It feels self-important.  And worst of all, it is boring.  It certainly does NOT get the PULSE racing (sorry to end with a bad pun, but it's no worse than the ending of this film.)",1227225600,,3168,4.752747252747253

Despite great cinematography and special effects work, the movie is saddled by a ridiculous script that works too hard explaining the back-story yet still winds up making no sense. What's worse, they obviously had a budget and several well known actors.  This could have been a good movie, but it succeeds only in startling those with jittery nerves.

If I ever saw the original, I have since forgotten it or the differences are too many for me to draw the connection.  It doesn't really matter what this movie is based on.  It simply does not stand on its own.

The Good

The dark filming and subtle lighting of the film do deserve some credit.  They definitely add to the mood of the intersection between the worlds of the living and the dead.  Yes it has been done before, but achieving this look is still technically challenging.  The muted colors and darkened pallet are used in a way that actually aids in the story.  So kudos to the director of photography and the cinematography team.

The special effects are also relatively well done. Although I still have a gripe in the fact that they are sometimes misused to create rippling and fuzzy fade-ins where the monsters or ghosts appear.  Still, that seems to be more of a flaw of editing or direction.  Whoever did the CGI work here deserves a lot of credit.  Unfortunately that is where the bulk of the positive ends.

The Bad

*Mild spoilers*
The story focuses on some college friends in a small town where research into an expanded wireless communications band has allowed *creatures* or *ghosts* to cross over into the world of the living.  As more people commit suicide and as their friends disappear, our young heroine much search for the answer in the form of a computer virus to disable the servers that are allowing these creatures to cross into our dimension.  These creatures seek out the living to take their life force away.  Nothing about this story in and of itself is unacceptable.  This is horror after all.  But they go to great lengths to explain how this might be possible.  In fact, the excessive explanations of the impossible are coupled with some things that are never explained, like that silly red tape.  On top of that, some of the lines that are given to these actors make no sense in the context of the movie.

The story line is so ridiculous as to prevent any rational person from suspending disbelief.  That's hard to do to a horror fan.  We can watch Mike Myers get shot 30 times and accept that he can get back up.  We are willing to accept space monsters coming to earth to eat us.  The fact that this story was so loosely written as to be unbelievable is terribly disappointing.

And if you want your movies to be filled with action, be prepared for Achilles heel number two.  Not only is the plot silly, but the story takes forever to get there and drags on in an ineffective attempt to create angst or dread.

Some of the acting is ok, but plenty of it is bad too.  And when you have terrible lines to deliver, it doesn't make acting any easier.  They definitely seemed to over-rely on the exaggerated scream here.

*Mild Spoiler Ahead*
If you know anything about technology, you will not want to watch this.  For example, there's a point where these creatures can apparently use cell phones to locate the living (apparently, they have access to CDMA and GSM technology).  The heroine stares at her phone and notices the bars as the radio bulletin warns against using computers or cell phones.  The monsters appear.  But once they get to a *dead zone* the monsters disintegrate.  Hmmmm.  Do you think you might want to turn your phone OFF???  Now I know where the idea for all those Verizon *dead zone* commercials came from.

The movie also has an oversimplified ending.  The solution to the problem is both silly and poorly depicted.  Granted the action does pick up above the occasional ghost jumping out at you to startle you.  When you finally reach the conclusion, you will probably experience more laughter than dread.

Conclusion

In my humble opinion, this movie was a missed opportunity.  If you are just looking for a few hours of mindless fun, this might still do it for you.  But if you know anything about how technology works, don't like slow moving movies, don't like dark noir movies and aren't easily startled by ghosts jumping out of nowhere, then this will bore you more than it will scare you.  And if you are critical of the many remakes of Japanese horror movies that don't live up to the originals, this probably fits in that group too.  Only see this if you have a free rental or it's on cable, but don't buy this DVD till you've seen the movie a few times.

1608337,4,B00005JOU0,"PULSE reminded me a little bit of IMPULSE with Tim Matheson and Meg Tilly from the 1980s, but it's not as good.  Its Japanese origins show up in its lackluster pacing and its dependence on a group of pale, powerful, angry ghosts who can not be stopped.  Once I see that an American movie was based on a previously existing Japanese one, I sort of stop hoping for a happy ending, I already know everyone is going to die (unless there's a child in it who can somehow reach back to a dead child ghost and get them to stop harassing today's adults), and there are so many movies nowadays in which everyone dies, and the blue filter is pumped up to fill the screen with industrial angst, enough already.

What a tragedy that low ratings cancelled TV's VERONICA MARS and stranded poor Kristen Bell in a movie career that does nothing but insult her.  It's sort of like what happened to Sarah Michelle Gellar ended, but SMG walked out of Buffy, so it's her own stupid fault, whereas if this were the best of all possible worlds VERONICA MARS would still be on the air, Logan and Piz perhaps squaring for an all-out competition now for Veronica's favors.  Instead we have PULSE.  It's sort of like a parody of VERONICA MARS' difficulties dealing with her mother.  Here we see the mother trying to call Mattie, Mattie trying to call the mother, then an hour later she tries again, then the movie forgets all about her.

Please, someone, take poor Christina Milian out of the movies.  She can't really act and nobody should have to play that scene where she's in the laundry room, the washer opens from within, and a ghost or something invisible starts throwing her laundry, one item at a time, out of the washer into the floor, splat.  Splat.  Splat.  And that's her best scene!  It's another horror movie where every person of color goes long before the white people.  You'd think Hollywood would learn a lesson but oh, no.  The friends of color are seemingly there just to perish and give their white co-stars some good discovery scenes: ""Why, Izzie, why?""  ""No, Stone, no!""  Nevertheless this movie has some important points to make and has warned me of the danger of turning on my computer and cell phone.  Got to go.",1217376000,,2212,4.542929292929293
1608407,2,B00005JOU0,"Pulse is a horror movie, with a modern twist. Being in the so called digital 'myspace' age the internet seems necessary, it wouldn't be complete without the terror lurking within. Ghosts of some sort in some odd manor established the internet as a haunting ground! They can effect wireless gear, cell phones, and printer as well.

 The concept seems a bit cheesy, but in all honesty it is somewhat original. The characters are presented with a chaotic mass suicide problem sweeping their city. The suicides seem not to be linked in any manor, but have touched home base with the leading female character (Mattie). To not spoil the movie, some frequencies were not meant to be touched... Some computers hide details on these events. Ghost will try to claim your will to live. Certain objects help prevent the ghosts from entering, but how long can one survive without the will to live?

As appealing as that may sound, the movie suffers from a short length (88 minutes), the effects are not too great, and the movie never really 'built' up. Upon understanding the basic plot, it feels like it's already over before it truly began! The ending felt rushed, and the scare factor was minimal.

1608408,3,B00005JOU0,"Pulse is not your average story of the Internet killer kind of thing. It is a story about a college student who has hacked his way into someone's computer and released a virus, or so they think. Weird things begin happening to those who use the Internet and people start to die or disappear.

The whole thing is focusing around the hacker's girlfriend who is trying to put a stop to this madness while losing her friends around her one by one.

I thought the movie was pretty entertaining and suspenseful up until the ending of the movie. The ending I was not pleased with one bit. I have not read the book this thing was based on, but the movie fan likes to see a happy ending, where all is safe, everything's over, life goes back to normal, and maybe it closes on one last demon remaining who has a quick clap sound effect to show it's not over, of the hand punching out of the ground, that sort of thing... not what they did for this movie.

If it was based on Mars, you might believe it, but it ends in a disbelief of reality that really spoiled the finale of this movie.

The overall FX and plot is OK, it was one of the better films I had seen for a while, well, up until the ending of the movie. It's pretty entertaining, but it just needed an alternate ending to help make it a better film.",1214697600,,1298,4.18

1608413,2,B00005JOU0,"The title notwithstanding, this film barely has a pulse of its own.  What should have been an exciting thriller somehow comes across as one of the most boring apocalyptic films I've ever seen.  The writers and directors were totally focused on the characters fighting to keep their wills to live from being sucked right out of their bodies - but what about my will to live?  As a viewer, I was fighting to survive, as well.  With electronic ghosts of ill-defined boredom closing in on me with each passing minute and a maze of loose ends to navigate along my way, I consider myself lucky to have come out the other side with my sanity intact.

So, what is this Pulse, anyway?  Well, if you don't know, the movie surely isn't going to tell you - not until you're closing in on the end of it, anyway.  By then, you won't even care.  Sealing yourself in a small area with red tape keeps the pulse out, though, for what it's worth.  Personally, I didn't have a problem with the pulse - not as long as it kept eliminating such uninteresting characters as you'll find littering this film.  The most comatose of the bunch is Josh (Jonathan Tucker), the dumb hacker who manages to unleash this whole business on the world in the first place.  Mattie (Kristen Bell) could use some serious training in the art of applying mascara, but you still wouldn't think the girl would be hard up enough to actually like this dweeb.  Through the magic of cyberspace, Josh can't stop being annoying even in death, which leads Mattie and her gang of college buddies into this whole pulse business.  Then, before you can say Bob's your uncle, the whole world is full of people either missing or walking around as empty shells of themselves (which actually sounds a lot like real life, come to think of it).  So - you guessed it - it's up to Mattie and her new hacker friend to basically save the world.

But how do you stop the pulse, especially when no one in the movie has really bothered to explain just what the heck it is, anyway?  Ah, there's the rub.  The writers, I'm sad to say, decide to take the easy way out, so don't plan on a wham bam ending to come along and suddenly make you want to stand up and cheer.  They don't even bother to address one of the seemingly important secondary plot points they kept bringing up all through the film.  Why introduce something into a film on several occasions if you aren't going to follow up on it at all?

Pulse is a sad case of the ""if you can't beat them, remake them syndrome"" sweeping Hollywood in the last few years.  In this case, even Wes Craven seems to recognize the fact that Asian horror is far superior to American horror.  I haven't seen the Asian film that Pulse was based on, but it had to have a stronger story that this film did.  Hollywood tends to grab an Asian film, disembowel it of all its juicy story goodness (substituting a hefty helping of CGI effects in its place), and expect it to be a success.  Maybe someday they'll all figure out that this strategy just doesn't work.  No matter how spiffy the CGI is, Pulse's special effects still cry ""The Ring"" in most viewers' ears.  Let me completely doom this movie's prospects for you by comparing it to Fear Dot Com - remember how awful that was and how completely let down you felt after watching that trainwreck of a film?  You're going to feel the same way about Pulse.  Enough said.",1205625600,3,3387,4.419354838709677
1608414,4,B00005JOU0,"Countless previews for this film peaked my curiosity and I had to pick it up.  The premise is pretty simple, that something in our world of electronics has linked us to a realm of the dead.  The delivery and development is handles well in a spooky manner as some college students start to be aware that something odd is starting to happen.  News broadcasts provide the viewer with a larger view of the problem.  What caused the breach?  Can it be sealed?  Is there any hope whatsoever?
Some of these questions are answered by the end of the film and some are left for pondering.  I enjoyed the overall creep-level of the film although I found some of the ending a bit un-thought out.  For instance, If the dead only have power through electricity and a town is abandoned by the living, who is providing the electricity?  Can a city be in flames and still have a fully-functional power grid?  If cell phones are a problem, can you increase the area they don't work in by destroying the towers?  Unfortunately, these questions are not answered.  But still, by film's end hackles will be raised and fans of creepy movies will feel satisfied.

1608416,2,B00005JOU0,"""Pulse"" is neither thrilling nor scary. I'm sorry to say this, but that's my impression. Some of the film's gloomy images of the deserted buildings and their interiors are effectively shot, but the story about some otherworldly existence coming through the internet to the physical world needs more refreshing approach than dark-lit library, strange images reflected in the mirror, or young men and women screaming and running around.

Kristen Bell is Mattie, whose boyfriend, she finds, is terribly depressed. She later discovers the true reason of his trouble in the strange images stored in his PC. The story looks like a rip-off of ""The Ring"" (or ""The Ringu"" if you like), but the difference is that the spooky entity behind the small screen is far more powerful than a ghost-like little girl coming out of a well.

As you know this is a remake of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's ""Kairo"" (aka ""Pulse"") made in 2001. He is often associated with such Japanese directors as Hideo Nakata and Takashi Shimizu, but Kurosawa is the most European in his filmmaking. He opts for slower narrative and less explanation that is fascinating to some viewers, frustrating to others. Whatever your reaction may be, this measured pace and ambiguity is his strength, so retelling Kurosawa's tale literally does not make much sense because in his case tension comes not from the logics, but from the atmosphere. His is like a zombie film without zombies, but surely Hollywood studio thought differently, inserting CG-created images here and there.

Where Kurosawa's ""Kairo"" successfully builds up the tension by not telling much about what is really going on, ""Pulse"" (or its characters) talks too much, trying unnecessarily hard to explain the logics of the ""invasion."" I am talking about the theories of red duct tapes, black ashes on the wall, and the means of infection. The more the characters talk about them, the sillier the film becomes and in fact that is exactly what happens in the final 15 minutes.

It is not just the reported studio tinkering and the clichd narrative that considerably damaged the remade film. It is that you just cannot remake some kind of film and ""Kairo"" is one of them.",1202688000,2,2176,4.953424657534247
1608487,1,B00005JOU0,"I figured this film would be a complete vomit when I got it for free while buying Rob Zombie's remake of HALLOWEEN.  The folks at DIMENSION must be pretty desperate to unload this nonsense if they have to give it away as a freebie.  Now I have to be bothered with getting this wretched, sensless, vile, waste of film out of my house because I would truly be embarrassed if anyone saw it in my home and thought that I was stupid enough to purchase it.

This film represents EVERYTHING that is wrong with American Horror cinema today.  There is not a single interesting or original idea in the entire film.  How much did DIMENSION have to pay Earl Dietman of WIRELESS MAGAZINE for his cover quote ""Unlike ANY horror film you've seen before or will ever see!  The scariest movie of the year!""  Of course the film is exactly the same old boring, PG-13, CGI, desaturated nonsense that the movie-by-committee system has been throwing at us for the last four or five years.  We've all seen everything in this incoherent, ugly film OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  When will film studios get the idea that CGI digital visual effects are tired, boring and simply no longer interesting?
CGI is not a substitute for IDEAS or SCARES, and of course PULSE has neither one.

There is also that matter of the hideously ugly look of this film.  Every single frame from start to finish is tinted a cold blue, which is of course supposed to make the film look serious, artistic and important.  Naturally, anyone who isn't brain dead will recognize immediately that this is just a cheap gimmick to make it seem like the viewer is watching SOMETHING when instead we are really watching NOTHING AT ALL.  No ideas, no scares, no humor, no art, no likeable characters.  NOTHING  That is what this film is.  It is an abundance of nothing.

Lets talk about the cast.  Suffice it to say that everyone sleepwalks through the entire film.  The entire cast as if they are on their way to a fashion magazine photo shoot, wearing clothes that would be impossible for the average American to afford.  Kristen Bell even takes a bath wearing full eye makeup (which is applied so heavily that she looks as if she has just time-warped out of a scene with Liz Taylor in CLEOPATRA).  There is nothing that could be remotely called acting going on anywhere in this botched incomprehesible mess.

Sadly, it has become a safe bet that if a horror film is released in the United States by any major studio, or if the name Weinstein is associated with the film, then you will be watching an idiotic, CGI filled train wreck.  Now of course there are the occasional exceptions to that rule (DISTURBIA, CABIN FEVER, GRINDHOUSE) but in general, studio film making has sold out so bad I don't believe they even know what a real horror film looks like any more.  Too bad the folks at DIMENSION don't take a look at films being released by true independents like ASYLUM, RAPID HEART, ECHO BRIDGE etc.

PULSE is certainly the worst film I've seen since SOUL SURVIVOR and in fact, it may be the worst film I've ever seen . . . EVER.  It is such an insulting, insipid, uninspired, artless heap of garbage.  A cinematic bowel movement.  Every single blue tinted, washed-out frame of it is an assault on what good film making should be.  It is really past time to simply boycott this stuff.  The fact that I got this film for free somehow makes it all even worse.  It is as if DIMENSION was saying, ""You simply have to watch this garbage, and we know that no individual with even the slightest big of discernment would ever pick up this stinking pile of dung, so we will give it you free of charge because we think you deserve it.""

I can't believe I ranted this long over such a rotten film.  Shame on everyone involved in making this rotten, wretched, hideously ugly film.

1608489,2,B00005JOU0,"First of all, this is a gorgeously shot movie. Dark scenes and brooding overheads at times verge on the mastery of say Tim Burton. But that's where the positives end.

I have never been a fan of `electronic horror', though certain Japanese films (such as `One Missed Call') do manage to keep my interest. Here, the story itself is ridiculous, as the world is being taken over by `something that escaped from a computer!'. Yeah, if that sounds bad, try watching TV's Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars) mouth the most idiotic dialogue ever heard (""I'm Scared, I really am"", ""Why did this have to happen? Why!?"" etc) and you have an idea of just how bad this is. Usually amazing Ian Somerhalder returns to the screen in a very boring role, and the movie follows the lead actress' attempts to solve the mystery and get out of town safe. To say this was an insult to ones' intelligence is an understatement.

Another thing - is CG really dead? I mean, the effects here started off good, and then went spectacularly bad (such as a plane crashing - so obviously fake) that it was difficult to retain interest in the movie, even in a campy way. Sadly, this is no showcase for anyones' talents. The best part is the first five minutes where a boy is attacked by a `computer demon' in a library. Sad to say, it all went downhill from here.

1608564,3,B00005JOU0,"A film that skirts uncomfortably close to ""date movie"" quality, with some excruciating bits of dialogue, usually expelled by blonde princess Kristen Bell who looks like daddy bought her an acting diploma. The cast at times seems like a second-string ""Dawson's Creek,"" which chips into the flow of an otherwise engrossing -- and satisfyingly creepy -- outing. The monster, (WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD) here represented by ghosts that have latched onto a new type of broadband and spread through computers like a virus, never devolves to the level of corny or boring, even if the premise seems a stretch. Examples of films that do stoop to that level are ""Thirteen Ghosts"" (take the special sunglasses off and the ghosts can't even mess with you) or ""The Descent"" (wherein once one of the hiker chicks decides to get their girl power on, she's tearing apart that sun-deprived beast with her fists, the gollums no more fearful than water balloons). It's hard to watch a technology-centric horror movie without think of ""Ringu,"" -- and ""Poltergeist"" could have been much more frightening under that director's wand -- because there's always that scene where the music is tweaking your eardrums with strands of anticipation, and you see a TV in a room and it's either showing static or there's a ghastly face on the screen, this time upgraded to a computer monitor. ""Pulse"" pays homage mostly, thankfully, to Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead."" By bringing in reports from the outside world, we are put inside their world: We are watching the same screen as the characters. These reports tell us the computer virus is spreading like wildfire and effectively turning everyone it touches into zombies: Their will to live is sapped once the ghost comes through the wires -- or wireless. And just as Romero was criticizing consumerism, director Jim Sonzero, albeit through Kiyoshi Kurosawa, who directed the original Japanese version, is commenting on man's abuse of nature, taken to mythic proportions like the story of Prometheus, as portrayed by Dr. Frankenstein. It's ultimately about man vs. machine, like a much slicker, more complicated and more fully clothed ""Saturn 3.""

Look, I'm not a J-horror buff, so I don't know how this stacks up against the rest, but I gather from others' comments this isn't the sort of film you frame your J-horror term paper around. ""Pulse"" is to horror what ""Starship Troopers"" is to sci-fi; an entertaining romp, a sort of homage to the genre that pokes plenty of fun at contemporary society -- I mean how else can you interpret the red electrical tape that keeps out the ghosts than as a jab at Homeland Security's duct tape debacle?",1173398400,2,2653,4.948430493273543

So I was kind of looking forward to this movie.  But the Japanese original was subtle and unorthodox in plot by American standards.  There's not really a story as such, as much as a slow unfolding of a mood of dread, punctuated by gradually escalating shocks.  In this American redo the special effects run riot.  The Japanese version whispered its terrors; this movie hammers you over the head LIKE SOMEONE WHO TYPES IN ALL CAPITALS. The big case-in-point and the one that aggravated me the most was the famous shot near the end of the Japanese film, that confirms that the world is coming to an end.  It's a brilliant coup that is absolutely breathtaking.  The same shot shows up in this remake, but it's so surrounded by other tacky FX that its impact is completely lost.  And it's not even half as convincing or real-looking as the Japanese scene anyway, which is ironic because that probably cost a fraction of this one.  A bad job all around, and I'm only giving it an extra star because of the presence of Bell, who is so cute she almost makes it worth sitting through.  Almost.",1173052800,,1252,4.624434389140271
1608697,2,B00005JOU0,"Pulse is yet another remake of a Japanese horror film, but this one boasts that it has a screenplay by horror master Wes Craven.  Whether or not that's true, Pulse doesn't offer much that we haven't seen before in the tons of drivel, PG-13 horror remakes before it.  The ungodly good looking young cast, including Veronica Mars' Kristen Bell, Lost's Ian Somerhalder, Jonathan Tucker, and Christina Millian; are pretty much nothing worth noting either, but is that really a surprise.  That aside, there are some wonderfully creepy moments to behold thanks to some great CGI effects, and the film's apocalyptic ending is a nice shot in the arm to boot.  Those good points aside, the rest of Pulse is horror fodder, even with some re-edited moments to remove the PG-13 rating.  Worth a look if for some reason you like the films to come out of the wave of Japanese PG-13 remakes, but otherwise there is plenty of other horror films that are far better and far more deserve your time.",1172793600,,980,4.707602339181286

1608700,2,B00005JOU0,"I wasn't expecting much from Pulse, and with such low expectations, I wasn't disappointed. It was everything a one- or two-star movie could hope to be.

What I did find disappointing was that they had a good idea somewhere, but everyone working on the film, top down, seemed to miss it. Then again, it was a remake of a Japanese horror classic (and Japanese horror films rarely, if ever, make sense), so they weren't trying to find an original story. Pity.

In an otherwise quiet college town, the suicide rate is skyrocketing. Eventually our heroes, Mattie (Kristen bell) and Dexter (Ian Somerhalder) realize that there is a virus, of sorts, in ""the system"", and odd, silvery specter-like creatures are the cause of it. These creatures, never explained, put themselves face-to-face with their victims and then it seems that they inhale and suck some essence from their victim, which feeds them - somehow. It makes for good viewing, but it doesn't make much sense. And because it doesn't make sense, we're not ""creeped-out"".

Since I'm reviewing this as the DVD, and not the film, I'm giving it two-stars - because for the first time that I can recall, the special features were subtitled. As I'm hearing impaired, I normally miss out on the special features, and even though these special features weren't all that exciting, I was able to watch them.",1171497600,3,1351,4.8652173913043475

But here I go anyway, Kristen Bell (Vernonica Mars) is trying to find out how her friend/boyfriend died and it leads to a discovery of a virus that causes people (including the viewers) to want to kill themselves, because they lose their will to live (again including the viewers).

The virus is spread through computers where unsuspecting idiots log onto a website that shows grainy video that is very jumbled and messy, but not in the least bit disturbing. The people then start dying after ghosts of sorts find these people and drain their life force to try and come back to life (I think or maybe they just want to make the live people in the film as lifeless as the movie itself).

The film fails on just about every level, as a mystery it is not good, the twists (the few that exist) are not suprising in the least. As a horror movie it really fails, no scares at all, (only thing scary is how people thought it was a good idea to greenlight this junk). This is really not very good to say the least, the acting is bad all around, no scares in sight, or plausible story for that matter and nothing worthwhile at all. Even the special effects are pretty lousy and the ending is really stupid, all I have to say is ""Turn off the (insert bad word here) cell phone"" and the problem will stop. * out of 4 stars.",1171324800,,1458,4.317518248175182

This movie started out really good but just got worse until the end.  It wasn't scary AT ALL! I'm a huge fan of horror movies and sorry people this was not scary.

What really irked me is the inconsistancy of the movie.

1.  First of all, the audience is told by a charachter in the movie that this computer virus makes people want to kill themselves, but thats not what we see! We see one charachter commit suicide and the rest die another way.  (I'll try not to spoil the plot).

2. In the beginning it was taking people days to die (or kill themselves...or whatever was happening) by the end they were dying within hours.  It's like the longer the movie got the quicker everyone died.

3. The charachters were to one dimensional to me.  We don't get to know anyone.  I'm telling you, there was one charachter that I was glad to see die!

I don't know.  It wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either.  I'd spend $2-$3 to rent it, but not $17 to own it.",1171324800,,1067,4.182266009852217
1608703,3,B00005JOU0,"In yet another Japanese remake gone horribly wrong, Pulse gives us a group of college kids essentially running from the Y2K bug.

Kristen Bell and Christina Milian headline a group of college kids who screwed up and downloaded a virus of some sort.  It's worse than Melissa, and as soon as the movie starts, it affects them personally.

First things first, I don't think someone could hang themself with CAT5 cable; nonetheless, Bell's boyfriend, Josh, commits suicide because he didn't update his McAfee virus definitions.  As the rest of the kids go through their technologically-dependant lives, it soon becomes clear that there is some sort of Trojan Horse haunting them and giving them some form of the plague.

From there the movie decays into a combination of ""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"", ""8MM"", and a poorly made bondage flick.  People die; shock scenes occur; spooky ghosts appear; and the only people that can escape are finally happy about their T-Mobile coverage area.

If you can get past the complete plagiarism of several other movies, then the acting and special effects make the movie bearable and somewhat worthwhile.  The electronic ghosts are pretty cool, and the flickering lights gave me a slight case of epilepsy.  It's worth watching as long as you have a tendency towards masochism, and you know absolutely nothing about computers.  It could easily be a really long marketing campaign for Norton, McAfee, or Mac computers, but at the very least Kristen Bell and Christina Milian are in it.",1171065600,2,1511,5.008
1608704,2,B00005JOU0,"For a film named ""Pulse"" and utilizing high-speed communications and modern technology as the catalyst for terror, this movie sure is a snoozer.  Let's face it folks, cellphones, computers, etc. are sure fun to mess with on your own, but they are downright boring to watch someone else use them in a film.  In ""Pulse,"" deadly, ghost-like beings have somehow figured out how to cross into our world via the internet, cellphones, etc.  When they make it to our side of the web, they suck the will to live out of their victims, eventually leading to suicide.  That's it in a nutshell.  It's boring, not scary at all, and full of modest performances from a cast headed up by Kristen Bell and Christina Milian.

If you've read the Stephen King novel, ""Cell,"" you've already got the jist of what the writers (including Wes Craven, who's quickly losing his status in the horror world thanks to clunkers like this) are trying to tell people.  If we rely too much on technology, it will eventually bite us in the rear.  Of course, in King's book, cellphones are used to turn people into zombies, essentially ""rebooting"" their brains and downloading new information into them.  In ""Pulse,"" we have unexplained beings from another place (most likely Hell) who are out to take the lives of the living.  As in ""Cell,"" when our heroes reach ""dead zones,"" things get a little bit easier as far as the life-sucking part goes.  However, much like ""Cell,"" the viewer is given a bland resolution to the tale.

This movie is just one of many remakes of Japanese horror flicks like ""The Ring 1 & 2"" and ""The Grudge 1 & 2.""  I've seen a few of the Japanese originals and most of the American remakes and I've learned one thing from them:  Japanese horror is boring and American retread horror is worse.  Don't get me wrong, I don't consider a film scary based on the amounts of blood and gore contained in them.  I base how scary a movie is on how suspenseful and terrifying it is.  In the case of the Japanese spookers and their American counterparts, neither are too scary.

If you're bored and have nothing better to do, check out ""Pulse.""  If you're a fan of Craven, this film will definite let you down.

It did have alot of scares and thrills to it. It definately had the flavor of the Ring and White Noise mixed into one. It was a little different to the horror genre and a welcomed one at that. Maybe everyone should try seeing the unrated version instead of complaining that it was rated PG-13. Again, that is just my opinion. What I definately do think is that the director should have left the deleted scenes in the movie. This would have given it a little bit more explaination to the film.

The best thing about PULSE is that they had the great sense to give KRISTEN BELL from Veronica Mars the title role. Understandably, PULSE is way beneath her. This girl can sing, dance and carry a television series, but she is pretty well wasted with this boring piece of film.

The movie is actually fairly good as Mattie (Bell) struggles to uncover why her boyfriend has slipt into a deep depression and seclusion. She enters his deteriated apartment and watches him emerge from behind a sheet of plastic. From that moment on, the film drags and bores with mild scares and the same technology kills theme we saw in THE RING.

We get an old man's head under bath water, we get arms and legs flailing around in a dryer, we get a large face puzzle sent through a computer printer and we get ghosts standing around being ghostly.

Ultimately, PULSE just plain falls flat as a movie that didn't push the envelope far enough. The characters trudge around in the dark throughout the entire film, seemingly avoiding the fate of the rest of the world, despite being the closest to the source, and ultimately disappoints.

Finally, this is just another film in a long slew of disappointing remakes from Japan that are tagged with a PG-13 rating and have only one purpose... to get teenagers money.",1169424000,,1513,4.651685393258427

The inferior ""White Noise"" had a similar idea, and I also noticed references to ""The Night of the Living Dead"". All in all, I thought first-time director Jim Sonzero has made a stylish, beautifully shot suspense film, and I don't feel like I wasted my time.

How do you take an intriguing concept and suck the life out of it?

Moody Lighting. Pretty People in Peril. Screaming and Running. Oh, and let's not forget a monster. Gotta have a Monster.

But poor Jim really isn't entirely to blame, he just captained the vessel onto the rocks. Wes Craven wrote the screenplay and if there is an indiviual that can be pointed at as the source for the dumbing down of American horror it would have to be him. To see how bad a movie can end up just look at his latest. Literally. Whatever is his latest, that is how bad it can be.  Just try to watch Cursed, for instance.

I think he actually hates horror movies and desperately wants to direct music videos.

Anyway, Pulse.

Wow. Where to begin?

How about with the monster.

This is a ghost story, There are no soulsucking monsters needed.

Ghost stories are about atmosphere. They deserve to be slow and creepy and get in under your skin so you think about them for days after. They are supposed to make the hair on the back of your neck raise at just the image of an empty room. How is this a difficult concept. Why can't Americans make a decent ghost movie?

Because there are no soul sucking monsters to portray.

Pretty People in Peril. We have nothing but those. All very attractive in their clean cut psuedo-grunge. Spewing dialogue that only a forty year old man would believe that college teens would say. If college students ever actually start talking this way we might as well shut down the universities and send them all to work at McDonalds and Wal-Mart.

Running and Screaming? In the first 5 minutes.

Ah, and the soul-sucking monster. Also in the first 5 minutes.

Does anyone remember when the monster wasn't revealed until the end of the movie?

If the trailers of today's movies didn't give you the entire substance then this trend should ruin movie watching. Wes and Jim introduce the monster before they've even introduced the cast. Maybe to save us time. We can now leave without missing anything. Except the Over-the-Top Visuals. A series of cliches strung together does not make for viewing enjoyment unless this is all you're used to, and then, mores the pity.

And then it goes down hill.

See the original. It will at least cause you to be involved as you try to figure out what is happening as the characters try to figure out what is happening.

1608801,3,B00005JOU0,"PULSE is yet another Japanese horror film remake, upgraded with state-of-the-art CGI and even bolstered with teen fave actors.  The story basically deals with a computer program that has proliferated through WiFi connections throughout the world (computers, handheld gaming systems, PDAs, telephones, etc) that access the internet.  The program allows evil spirits to enter our world and they do horrible and eerie things to anyone they come in contact with.

Kristin Bell (VERONICA MARS) plays Mattie, the college student looking for answers for her boyfriend's suicidal hanging.  Ian Somerhalder (Lost) stars as Dexter, the living-on-his-wits guy who ends up being the hero lead.  The movie was directed by Jim Sonzero.  Horror-guru Wes Craven and Ray Wright wrote the screenplay.  The movie is based on Kiyoshi Kurosawa's KAIRU.

The movie looks sharp and edgy, and the subtle loss of color throughout the film to where the final climatic moments are pretty much in black-and-white is really good.  Kristin Bell delivers a solid performance, but there's not much character to work with.  Somerhalder had to deal with much the same thing.  The soundtrack is awesome, offering some chilly bits that can frazzle the nerves if you're watching it alone in the dark (as I was).

Although several effects in the movie are genuinely scary and stomach-turning, the overall experience just didn't live up to the hype.  Maybe I've seen too many horror movies over the years to be truly surprised, but I wanted something more from this film.  The movie never really explains where the ""dead,"" if that's what they are, came from.  Or why they wanted to suck the souls from the living.  Or anything in the way of truly scientific or supernatural.  The story just ground through till its inevitable conclusion with some neat effects and bits along the way.  (Such as the scene in the laundry room, which is probably the most powerful one in the whole movie.)

PULSE is definitely worth a rental and a look, but not necessarily a keeper.  Except for the true horrorphile.  The special features, although not packed, are a welcome addition.

Likewise, I enjoy many of the American adaptations (""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge""). But this film (much like the adaptation of Dark Water) simply misses the mark.

Kristen Bells' performance is flat and uninspired. I see on IMDB that she is a television actress . . . it shows. She adds nothing to the film. And, while she may have been a fine minor character, she could not carry the film as a lead. On the other hand, Samm Levine proves himself worthy of the ""big-screen"" . . . though underwritten, his part was well-executed (pun intended). . . I hope to see more of this young actor in future films!

Though seemingly original (to American audiences) the overall theme of the film is flawed. We typically do not see invasion/infection films which involve specters, ghouls, ghosts, or the undead. It is a clash of the public and the private  . . . and while this is quietly reflected in the theme of technology invading our living space, it is not thoroughly expressed. Hence, the films reads as two sub-genres uncomfortably mashed together. Certainly, this is a theme which could have worked . . . it could have been horrific . . . and that is the problem. The Ring skillfully expressed the world's anxiety of technology . . . Verbinski was not heavy-handed with his message . . . it simply lingered on the surface of the work . . . hauntingly. How I long for more of that!!

There was not a single startling moment. The ""creepiness factor"" was zero. There was not even the old ""make-the-audience-jump-for-a-cheap-thrill""
moment. This is the most disappointing aspect of the film . . . it simply fails at being horror.

Make very sure you listen in 5.1 to this film, because several scenes make the most of this technology. More and more, the invasive edits that destroy stories are making unrated versions the defacto quality versions.
The story is pretty straight forward, but the scare factors come from the slow build, and the theatrical edition had the slow build elements deleted.
Also, the DVD menu is a great design. The deleted scenes are, once again, ones that should not have been. The making of, and the Special FX elements are very good. Also, with two commentaries, forget about the directors, and focus on the second one with Joel Soisson and others... not only is the second one more informative, but its damned entertaining.
Another first rate Romanian shoot, just goes to show that low cost does not mean low value, just that MPAA approved means the story is eviscerated.

1608866,2,B00005JOU0,"Wow. I don't really know where to begin in berating this movie. Let's start with the plot. Oh wait, what plot? Somehow a hacker releases spirits from a server and allows them into the real world. They want to attack people and 'steal their will to live.' Seriously. Their WILL TO LIVE. Not their soul or their life or even their skin a la Hellraiser... no, just their will to live. Once the will to live is taken, the people become depressed and kill themselves... oh wait, not always, sometimes they just turn into a pile of ash. Anyway, they're coming through our internet cables, our cell phone signals, and even wifi... but red tape keeps them from walking through your door. I still don't know if your wifi signal calls them to walk over to where you are or if they actually come through the systems... that's not defined at all. Somehow everyone in this city starts getting attacked by the ""will to live goblins""... everyone except our main heroinne and her hunky new friend who bought her dead boyfriend's computer. The will to live goblins know that those two are the main characters, so they leave them alone. Too bad, because the movie could have been a lot shorter if they'd gotten to them quicker.

The cinematography is cool: but the style has already been seen (and put to much better use) in The Ring and The Grudge.

The acting is pretty poor, but you can't entirely blame the actors when they have to say lines like, ""All the classrooms are half empty... and NO ONE is TALKING about it!"" Righhhhht.

The surprise ending that's mentioned on the back of the DVD case is actually a surprise... but not in a good way. It's more like the definition for ""cop out"". It seems like they ran out of time and money and said, ""instead of saying we quit... let's just say that it's a surprise.""

There's also NO REASON for this to be an UNRATED version. The violence is hardly graphic, the ""will to live goblins"" are barely scary, there's no sexual connotations, and the ""F"" word is used once... the unrated version is just a gimmick.

Kinda like that book ""Cell"" by Stephen King where those who had cell phones turned into zombies and those who didn't use them were the survivors.  The plot was interesting, the ghosts were scary, but the acting was lacking. A lot of eye candy in the film, with young and hot Christina Milian and Kristen Bell... but their acting left more to be desired.  The storyline was good enough, but it just left you wanting more.

As I wrote in the review for ""WHITE NOISE"", a film somewhat similar, if the Movie Gods existed, they could merge the two films and you would have a really decent horror film, maybe even a great one.  White Noise had the star power (sort of) and part of the plot (the beginning half) and PULSE had the eye candy, the scary ghosts, and the rest of the plot, with an 'R' rating instead of 'PG-13' and we have a great movie worthy of an a academy award!

1608868,4,B00005JOU0,"After all the bad stuff I heard about this movie I rented it with pretty low expectations; I just wanted to see the star of my favorite show (Kristen Bell of ""Veronica Mars"") in a horror film.  To my surprise I really got into it.  It's not particularly scary, but it's got an amazing look and style to it; definitely made me think of the Silent Hill video games.  Bell and the rest of the cast provide better acting than most movies of this nature.  Overall I really got caught up in the film.  ""Pulse"" is nowhere near as good as ""The Ring,"" but it's definitely better than ""The Ring Two"" and ""The Grudge"" movies.  Worth a rental at least.",1166054400,24,640,4.291666666666667
1608869,2,B00005JOU0,"I almost have given up on horror films these days. I usually just rent them out now for comedy- which is exactly what this film did for me. Yes the beginning was a bit on the creepy side sure, but after 40 minutes it just grows boring to the point where I started losing interest. So maybe because of that I missed a few things but it's obvious now by some of the other reviews here that it wasn't only I left confused at the end as I tried to place the entire film together. Overall this film does will not, I think, satisfy long time horror fans, but just gives the same old formula of many new horror films coming out with a plot that doesn't keep you too long. It is creepy in some spots sure, but nothing that will keep you up at night or even an hour after the film.

So yeah basically average actors are trying too hard to be scared play out a rather odd plot that doesn't fully make sense even towards the end. Matter of fact it just gets more confusing then. The ending is odd to say the least and yet by then I could have cared less. Nothing keeps you in your seat in this film except the curiosity of what is really going on and an interesting explanation on even how it is possible. And you only get loose ends regardless so I do not recommend this film. There are better horror films out there, both new and old.",1165968000,4,1325,4.096153846153846
1608870,1,B00005JOU0,"Ok, this review has no reflection on the writer or actors/acteresses.  The plot was good, the acting decent, but filming sucked.  This is so bubble gummy anyone who is thirteen years old or younger would enjoy.  I will list my reasons why.

1: WHAT IS UP WITH THE METAL SCREECH IN EVERY HORROR MOVIE BEFORE SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS?  The metal screech isn't scary its annoying and it needs to be stopped.  Did we hear a metal screech in The Hills Have Eyes, Hostel, High Tension, The Grudge, or The Ring, no we didn't.

2: THE EFFECTS SUCKED! I felt like I was watching a cartoon.  Listen take notes from old school.  The Exorcist, Jaws, Cujo, The Shining, Alien, Candyman, or Hellraiser,none of these movies were animated by computers, they used old school effects that looked real.  It pisses me off that Hollywood is so sold out that people cant dig into their pockets and come up with an effect that looks real or half way decent.

3: WHAT THE HELL IS WITH THE FLASHBACKS AND IRRITATING BLUE FILTER? This is so distracting, every flashback or dream had that blasted metal screech. ANNOYING!  Also the film jumped around it reminded me of a music video from the 90's.

For future work please document the hard works of the following writers/directors: Alexandre Aja, Eli Roth, Miike, Clive Barker, Stephen King excluding Dreamcatcher and many more.  If your going to do a horror movie make it worth it!",1165881600,5,1402,4.669387755102041
1608871,3,B00005JOU0,"*Pulse* was an ok movie.  I wasn't pleased with the loose ends in the story and the ending.  I was looking forward to see a scary movie.  (Is there no such thing as a scary movie these days?!?!)  The cover makes it look like you'll jump from your seat 3 feet high and scream your head off.  Alas, that was not to be.

The movie opens with Josh looking for a fellow, Ziegler, in a dark library.  Now, why anyone look for someone in a library with the lights off?  Suddenly, a phantasmic face appears and attacks Josh.  We don't know what happened next.

The next scene, we see Mattie with her friends at a bar.  She's worried about Josh.  She hasn't heard from him in days.  Apparently, they had a big fight and have broken up or on the verge of doing so.  The next day, Mattie goes to Josh's run-down apartment.

Josh allows her to come in.  Mattie notices that he's lifeless like a zombie and his talks are enigmatic.  He tells her to wait in the living room while he goes to another room.  She takes a quick survey around the apartment.  There are maggots everywhere.  She hears muffled meows from somewhere and goes to investigate.  She discovers a bloody, emaciated cat.  (The movie never explained what the cat was doing there or why it was in that condition.  We don't even know if Josh ever had the cat as a pet.)  Next, she hears a noise in the next room where Josh went.  That's where she discovers that Josh committed suicide.

Mattie cannot be comforted over Josh's suicide.  She blames herself for not recognizing the signs.  However, pretty soon, she starts to get messages from Josh.  Her friends are also getting messages from Josh.  It seems that Josh is communicating from ""the other side"".

It looked like the movie was building up to a wonderful suspense, with some scary moments, but it never happened.  There were too many loose ends that made you wonder.  These little questions in your head do distract you from the movie.  For example, after Stone gets attacked by a ghost, Tim goes to check up on him.  When Tim arrives, he discovers Stone halfway merged with a wall, which he'll soon disappears into.  Again, no explanation of the merging with the wall.

Eventually, Mattie tracks down Dexter, who bought Josh's computer from the landlady.  Dexter discovers Josh's video files.  From there, they were able to locate an address for Ziegler.  However, Ziegler doesn't really prove to be much help.  In fact, he's a cheesy paranoid character, which definitely didn't help the movie.  Ziegler only provides a brief vague background of how these ghosts came into being.  Ziegler had tampered with some unknown frequencies which released, with Josh's help, these ghosts into reality.  These ghosts have slowly been eating up humanity.

Throughout the movie, Mattie notices that there are less and less people everywhere.  People are just simply disappearing...into ashes.  It seems that people are safe when they're in a ""dead zone"" (no electronic signal).

Dexter discovered that Josh created a virus that would eradicate the ghosts.  Dexter and Mattie go to some basement to feed the virus into a computer central system.  Dexter uploads the virus.  It seems like it going to be a success.  However, the computer shuts down and reboots itself, rendering the virus useless.

The apocalyptic ending was an ""OMG"" moment.  The narration will make you feel like you've watching a movie version of *The Outer Limits* episode.  Like I said, I was so looking forward to a scary movie but didn't get that.  The movie was so-so because of the story's loose ends and ending.",1165881600,,3585,4.711974110032362
1608872,4,B00005JOU0,"Ahh, Kristen Bell jumps from the CW to the big screen with America's recent adaptation of the horror movie, Pulse. It does me good to see my Veronica Mars' heroine on the big screen where she attempts to command the stage in this lukewarm horror movie.

Bell plays Mattie, a smart and witty girl who is dating a depressed and somewhat reclusive Josh...or so we are lead to believe. After Josh goes M.I.A. Mattie decides to visit him at his apartment to find him acting odd. He looks pale and lifeless as he tells Mattie to ""wait here"" while he commits suicide.

Nothing new for our Mars' heroine right? She solved the death of Lily Kane, so this one should be a cake walk. But unfortunately, Mattie doesn't have daddy dearest by her side nor the elements of reality.

After getting several messages from Josh on her computer after his death, Mattie decides to do a little detective work. She tracks his computer down to a Dexter McCarthy, and finds what is on his hard drive truly disturbing. ""Do You Wanna See A Ghost,"" the computer asks, as it later turns out that Josh has let these creatures loose from the computer and is now accessible through any electronic device. Mattie is not going up against any rapists or has been movie stars in this one, she is going up against the dead.

So what are these creatures motives? The chance to be given life again and that's what they take from our batch of characters, including a lifeless performance by pop sensation Christina Millian. Bell's character is strong, with a backbone and a sense that reality can be bent and there is something supernatural that can't be explained. After all, how else can these suicides be constantly occuring and teachers walking in front of buses. Not to mention that the student population is dramatically on the decline and Mattie is the only one who seems to notice.

""It's coming for us. It's the end of the world,"" says the man at the local diner. Followed by a few jolts from our pale friends and the creepiness of hearing them through the walls, the film really can't make the audience jump like viewers would want, but it is complicated to make that happen these days. After all, everything now is ""been there, done that"" territory.

As for the script, it does not offer much with character background except for Mattie and Josh and pales in comparison to other characters. However, it does shed some light on the Kairo adaptation to explain the odd shadows on the walls and how the creatures are stealing the lives of others.

For 90 minutes, the movie does offer some entertainment. Minor chills, minor suspense, but huge on the computer animation makes this movie a decent film to watch for the fun of it. So unless you got a date with someone on the internet or a better movie to watch, grab some red tape and journey on what is to believed the unknown.

But you may tend to ask yourself the same question Mattie did to Dexter when first looking at Josh's computer; ""Why are we watching this again?"" For sure entertainment, Mattie. Sure entertainment.",1165795200,4,3043,4.611829944547135

Something about some attractive teenagers using text messaging and cellphones constantly, and then their souls are sucked out by gray, bald demons.  I guess.  Again, I don't know.  Whatever happens, it isn't scary, it's just sort of boring.  The entire film is the color blue, so if you watch it through a pair of 3-D glasses and keep your left eye closed, you won't be able to see anything.

Filmed in murky blues and near whites at times, the movie drudges along with incoherency a main ingredient of the storyline as a lovely lass investigates why her boyfriend committed suicide.  Kristen Bell and Ian Somerhalder try valiantly, but others such as Ron Rifkin and a brief cameo by resident nutcase Brad Dourif only serve to show how hard it is to make a good horror movie these days.

1608971,2,B00005JOU0,"""Pulse"" comes breezing into theaters as the latest remake of a Japanese horror film. J-horror is lucrative these days, as was demonstrated by ""The Ring,"" ""The Grudge,"" and their sequels. Problem is, something keeps getting lost in translation. In general, Japanese horror films (like much of Japanese culture) involve the clash between the old and the new, between tradition and technology. In ""The Ring,"" a vengeful ghost implanted itself, virus-like, on a VHS tape. In ""The Grudge,"" a jealous murder caused an ordinary house to become possessed by a force of supernatural fury. But while the original films are based around understatement and slowly-mounting terror, the American versions tend to abandon that for a slick production design and lots of ""Boo!"" moments. While watching ""Pulse,"" all I could think was, same old, same old.

The plot is barely coherent, but I'll do my best. Kristen Bell (from ""Veronica Mars"") stars as a college student named Mattie who, along with some forgettable friends, goes to the single ugliest school in the country, a dismal maze of industrial concrete, crumbling plaster, rust, cracks, mold, and rot. Their geographic location (Columbus, OH) is never stated, probably to avoid offending the people who live there. You know how college students in movies always live in apartments that they could never afford in real life? ""Pulse"" overturns that rule by showing us apartments that only a college student would be desperate enough to live in. Everything seems to be in a state of decay -- including Mattie's boyfriend, Josh (Jonathan Tucker) who no one has seen for days. Mattie drops by his apartment to find the place in a disgusting state and Josh looking and acting like a zombie. While she's there, he wanders into a closet and hangs himself. We already know something of Josh's fate: in the film's opening scene, he goes poking around a spooky library and gets attacked by a flickering, half-seen creature. And there was something weird on his computer screen...

While Mattie struggles to get over Josh's demise, more questions pop up. Why'd he do it? Why were his bedroom windows covered in red electrical tape? And if he's dead...who's IM'ing Mattie and her friends from his account? Mattie finds that his computer has vanished from the apartment, but eventually locates its new owner, a two-bit hacker named Dexter (Ian Somerhalder from ""Lost,"" playing more or less the same role). When Dexter plugs in Josh's machine, all he can find is a glowing line of text -- ""Do you want to meet a ghost?"" -- and some grainy, unsettling video footage of hollow-eyed kids in various stages of suicide. He and Mattie join forces to figure out what's going on, while the supporting characters are systematically dispatched by horror movie clichs. (Never, never, NEVER do laundry alone in the basement!) Mattie herself keeps having encounters with the flickering phantoms, though they never actually attack her, maybe 'cause she has top billing. Meanwhile, fragments of news footage hint that something terrible is happening all over the country, maybe the world. Seems Josh did some hacking of his own, and opened the wrong file, and unleashed....ghosts, or demons, or something. The movie never pauses to explain itself; the new character who pops up near the end to reveal the source of the horror isn't helpful at all. Isn't it weird how characters in a movie can explain so much while explaining nothing? ""Silent Hill"" had the same problem. The ending of ""Pulse"" is supposed to be all grim and apocalyptic, but all I could think was: Yay! They're finally away from that butt-ugly school! I mean, if I had to attend there, I'd be pretty suicidal too.

""Pulse"" isn't a total loss, though its best elements are still pretty derivative. The production design is moody and atmospheric, saturating the screen with melancholy blues and greens -- too bad ""The Ring"" already used that trick. The sound design is jagged and unsettling and serves to heighten what little tension there is -- but again, it's nothing that hasn't screeched and crackled and gurgled on soundtracks before. The special effects are sufficiently polished and provide us with some of the best moments, as the cyber-ghosts waver and jitter across the screen and their victims, sucked dry of their will to live, disintegrate into patches of black mold. The actors do the best they can with what little they've got -- I like Bell, Somerhalder, and Christina Milian (as Mattie's best friend), and I wished they were in a movie that gave them more than one emotional state. (Bell is ""Angsty,"" Milian is ""Sassy,"" and Somerhalder is ""Just Plain Out Of It."") Oh, and creepy character actor Brad Dourif (""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Child's Play,"" ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" and about a million other things) pops up in a random cameo, the subtext of which is ""Look! It's creepy character actor Brad Dourif in a random cameo!""

I guess the bottom line is...stick with the Japanese original. ""Pulse"" isn't an awful movie, just an uninspired one. I can't think of anything in the film that I hadn't already seen. Decades from now, ""Pulse"" will probably be shown in film study classes as a prime example of how, at the start of twenty-first century, Hollywood had barely an original idea in its head. Maybe that's why the cyber-ghost-demon-things are so intent on wiping us out: hiding in their digital lair, spying on humanity, they said to each other, ""Enough is enough! Let's take over the planet before the humans make a bland, assembly-line horror movie about us! Oops, too late.""",1156550400,36,5578,4.949839914621132
1608972,3,B00005JOU0,"Pulse (Jim Sonzero, 2006)

Okay, the good news: Pulse was a whole lot better than I expected it to be, given that it's an adaptation of a Japanese horror film, is directed by an unknown, is scripted by the long-past-his-prime Wes Craven, is cast with the usual young-and-beautiful TV actors, and bears little resemblance to the original film. (I attribute this betterness to the complete absence of Roy Lee.)

The bad news: it's certainly not the film it could have been.

But this is beside the point. The real point of this review is to ask a question that has, previously, been a hypothetical one for film snobs like me: why don't we get good remakes of Japanese horror films in America? Because, folks, this question is no longer hypothetical (and I can no longer attempt to answer it with ""Roy Lee""). I can tell you exactly why it is.

What is it that makes Pulse stand head and shoulders over your basic Japanese horror film remake? One thing: where Japanese horror films do a lot of leaving of gaps and making the viewer work for it (and Kairo, Kiyoshi Kurosawa's original film, is notorious for this), American horror films, and especially those that are remakes of Japanese horror films, fill in those gaps. The viewer isn't supposed to work at all when watching a Hollywood horror film. Now, Pulse does fill in some of the gaps in the usual Hollywood way, but it leaves a number of them. And guess what it is that American reviewers, critics, pundits, and armchair quarterbacks are complaining about? You got it-- the fact that the viewer has to work is being lambasted, and the movie is being called ""disorganized"" and ""incoherent."" So why won't you get good remakes of Japanese horror films in America? Because the American public doesn't want them. They were destined to think this movie sucks.

And it doesn't, really. Sure, it's not Kairo. And there are some silly missteps, and a couple of scenes that appear for the sole purpose of throwing in special effects (the ""elevator scene"" from the trailer, with the two little ghost kids, is a prime example), but overall it works. It's certainly miles better than the recent horrors that were the remakes of Dark Water, The Hills Have Eyes (see? We can't even remake American movies right!), The Grudge, The Ring Two, etc. etc.

Mattie Webber (Veronica Mars vixen Kristen Bell) is a university student in Columbus, Ohio. [feel free to insert jokes about Columbus liberally throughout the rest of this review.] Her boyfriend Josh (Jonathan Tucker, recently of Hostage and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake) has been out of contact for a week, so she heads over to his apartment to see what he's up to. While she's there, he commits suicide. Mattie and the rest of her friends-- roommate Isabell (Torque's Christina Millian), Stone (Roll Bounce's Rick Gonzalez), and Tim (Samm Levine, whose small role in Broken Lizard's Club Dread is unforgettable) try to figure out why Josh killed himself-- and why his suicide seems to have sparked a rash of others, along with an even bigger wave of simple disappearances. Eventually, Dexter (Lost's Ian Somerhalder), who bought Josh's old computer from his landlady, also gets roped into things. (I can't really stick it in a quick plot summary, but I feel compelled to point out that there's a quick, and absolutely wonderful, Brad Dourif cameo here that almost made me stand up and cheer.) There's an abundance of red duct tape, as well.

As I said before-- you're going to have to work for this. If you go to the theater expecting to turn your brain off and watch mindless action, Pulse is not the film for you. Sonzero is not going to hand you everything on a plate, spelled out in Alpha-Bits. You will have some dots to connect. (It probably helps to have seen the original, as well.) But with some thinking, it's pretty easy to grasp. The real star of the show here, though, is the subtlety with which things are shown as Sonzero builds up to his big, but quite understated, revelations. ""Subtle"" is not a word one is often able to use with Hollywood productions. This could be another reason the film is charged with incoherence; people weren't paying attention. Man, wouldn't that be a surprise?

The movie's biggest flaw, especially in comparison with its predecessor, is the ending-- specifically, Kristen Bell's ""let's spell out the big underlying theme"" voiceover, which is utterly unnecessary, not to mention surprising in a film that had delivered it so well up until then. Points off for stupidity on Craven's part.

But the best thing about this movie, perhaps, has nothing to do with the movie itself-- it was coming out of the theatre and watching everyone immediately reach for their cell phones. I just sat and watched them and chuckled to myself. ***",1156377600,9,4770,4.779126213592233
1608973,3,B00005JOU0,"Going into ""Pulse"" my expectations had this film as a possible Worst Movie of the Year candidate. First, it was pushed back on the release schedule, then not screened for critics, then ravaged by critics. When I told my friend at work that I was going to see it I was accused of being stupid and having the hots for Kristen Bell. And while both of those things may be true, my system for selecting movies is 100% random (lots of coin tosses are involved), so there was no stopping me. What I found was a serviceable genre film that at least had enough box office strength to fill the Times Square theatre I saw it in. However, despite a few interesting ideas ""Pulse"" is a minor failure. Kristen Bell, one of our brightest young actresses, helps make the point that TV is a more relevant medium than film in 2006. Why watch her play an idiot on the big screen when you can watch her play a smart, confident, funny female role model on the small screen? But horror is the new comedy and people didn't show up for a female role model. People do show up to be part of a communal experience in which you don't watch the movie, you experience it.

The film seemed to be going for a creepy vibe as opposed to a downright scary or violent one. For most of the film this vibe worked. I didn't care about the characters, but I did care about the world they inhabited. I especially liked the use of red to enhance to mood. The plot involves a group of vapid teenagers who succumb to creatures that are sneaking through the internet. Unfortunately, it doesn't always make sense. Some characters go live in another dimension, some vanish into thin air, some develop nasty black stains all over their body. I was scared a few times but never felt as though director Jim Sonzero earned them. The scares were telegraphed from a mile away and I blame the theatre atmosphere more than filmmaking skills for those scares. Had I been watching this film on DVD the number of scares I experienced would probably have been zero.

The main point of the film is clearly to indict our not too bright younger generation and their over-reliance on communication technology. Early on Mattie (Bell) proclaims that her relationship with her boyfriend had been reduced to text messaging, and that she is avoiding her mother's phone calls.  In other words, she is sleepwalking through her relationships, the most human or human experiences. And modern technology is helping her do this. Then later, when the characters start being struck by the internet monsters they become zombiefied shells of humanity, and then they die. The point is really driven home by the fact that Mattie is constantly carrying around her cell phone (like all teens and 20-somethings I know). That a certain cell phone provider obviously paid for product placement is beyond ironic. ***",1156032000,4,2829,4.631474103585657

7942519,1,B00005JOU0,"I find it really difficult to believe that the 4 and 5 star reviews are real - I have to suspect they are mostly friends or employees of the producers, because this movie is just definitively terrible. Virtually ZERO character development, no backstory, and an absolutely absurd plot. No reason for the ghosts to do what they're doing. A totally stupid explanation for what is going on. None of it matter by the end - which is lame, unsatisfying, and just silly - because the total lack of character development means we don't give a rat's rear end what happens to any of these characters.  I'd love to give better detail, but can't figure out how without spoilers.",1513123200,,665,4.635593220338983

7942523,3,B00005JOU0,"This was a film i saw when it came out,as a teenager in theaters.it was eerie then,so I snagged it really cheap & figured ""why not"" trip down memory lane and I found myself annoyed by how overwhelminglyndark the film was when it was shot.that plays a big role in the star/film quality. All in all it beats 1 Missed Call...it was ok for its day. Kristen Bell does a great job as the lead role,she acts well,better than the others.altho the film has a dwindling cast at a rapid pace.dig it.",1506124800,,488,4.315217391304348
