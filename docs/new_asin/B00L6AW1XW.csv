6472807,5,B00L6AW1XW,"A thought provoking psychological isolation horror film not to be missed or underestimated..

6472809,5,B00L6AW1XW,In the last decade most of the horror genre is basically torture porn - so it's great to see a suspense and psychological horror film like Dead Within. It's plenty frightening and tension filled and still manages to develop three dimensional characters with a real relationship and personality. Highly recommended.,1410134400,4,314,5.3
6472810,5,B00L6AW1XW,I'm not a huge horror movie buff but the cool thing about Dead Within is that it's as much an intimate character drama as it is a horror movie.

6472853,5,B00L6AW1XW,"Zombie movies definitely aren't my thing, with the exception of Evil Dead, Cabin in the Woods, World War Z, and now - Dead Within.  You KNOW a movie was good when it effects you on unlimited levels, yet it was pretty much shot in one small location (with only 2 characters) for the entire time and those major details don't even occur to you until the film is long over.

Truthfully, I would have only given it 4 stars because 5 stars basically puts it up there with my all time favorites such as Let the Right One In or The Orphanage, but here's my justification for lucky # 5:

1.  I watched this movie at 8:30 in the morning.  It was my attempt to fall back to sleep, assuming it was going to suck big time and I'd be tongue wrestling Derek Jeter in my dreams before any sleep-blocking action arose.  However, this isn't one of those horror movies where you watch people clinking wine glasses to old times for an hour first, LOVE it.

2.  Not only did I watch the entire movie, at 8:30 am, but I put on a proven snoozer afterwards and while I was dead asleep I had the CRAZIEST dream ever about my Mom being a hot latin dance queen in need of an exorcism!

I can totally understand why others many not have fancied it and totally think this movie is for people with intense (and weird) imaginations, but just like that serving of green peas your were force fed as a child - you won't know until you try it.",1416614400,,1409,4.20817843866171

6472877,4,B00L6AW1XW,"This was an entertaining and thoughtful film.  I would have done things a little differently with the ending, but still - a suspenseful movie that keeps you guessing with some implied and actual plot twists that provide some great thrills.",1414713600,,239,4.975

6472880,3,B00L6AW1XW,"The zombie holocaust seems to be taking over horror films these days. It seems like there is a new zombie movie being released each week. Where THE WALKING DEAD led the way for this new increase in interest in the genre, the knock offs have been nothing more than excuses for an over abundance of gore and lack of story telling. That's not true with DEAD WITHIN.

Rather than take the characters involved in the story out into the world to watch them battle zombies we instead centralize the story to take place in their home, fortified and made safe to prevent being attacked. Located in the woods a stone's throw from civilization, Mike and Kim have been holed up in their cabin for 6 months. The only time away from one another is when Mike heads out to salvage for supplies to keep them alive.

What makes this different from most zombie flicks today is that it focuses on the couple and not the zombies. Sure there is a zombie fight tossed in when we see flashbacks to another couple that visited and turned at some point but the main concept here is the couple. What makes it even more interesting is that you begin to wonder as it moves forward if there really is a zombie attack going on or did Mike make Kim believe this in order to keep her to himself in the cabin? Or could it just be that Kim has gone insane?

The answers to these questions come up before the credits role but the journey to that point makes for an interesting film. No one usually takes into account the problems that survivors would face on a day to day level and when they do it's always a quick flash and then back to action. Here we see a couple trying to live off of what they can find and some times that means sharing a single can of peaches for your only meal that day. Not only that but the only person each of them has contact with day after day each other. That's got to take its toll after a while.

Things slowly begin to spiral downward. When Mike is gone for longer than usual, while at the same time a group of wolves approaches the house, things become tense. If that weren't enough Kim begins to reveal more of the story of what went down with their friends as well. What we see here is less a tale of survival and more a story of a woman's descent into madness.

While I doubt I'll watch this again it was interesting the first time around. It kept me watching until the end and offered a new view of the whole zombie genre that many never seem to consider. If you're a fan of the genre of or horror films in general I'd recommend watching it. It might not be one to keep on the shelf but it's worth one viewing at least.",1413763200,4,2621,4.2235528942115765
6472881,5,B00L6AW1XW,"Dead Within is not your traditional Texas Chainsaw type of horror movie. I found it to be more of a psychological thriller with multiple layers. Amy Cale Peterson, the lead actress, was superb. Dean Chekvala also did a fine job. I highly recommend it.",1413158400,3,251,4.7272727272727275
6472882,1,B00L6AW1XW,Boring film with little to no scares. The wife character is a pain in the ass ingrate.  you can make a movie about cabin fever without giving your audience a blow by blow description of someone's boredom.,1412899200,2,204,4.513513513513513
6472883,1,B00L6AW1XW,Absolutely terrible movie unless you enjoy watching two people sit in a room and do nothing. Shouldn't even call this a zombie movie as you barely ever see one.,1412553600,2,160,4.551724137931035

6472886,1,B00L6AW1XW,Depressing and claustrophobic.  Also a bit predictable. Found myself skipping through it and still didn't manage to watch the end.,1412208000,2,130,5.5
6472887,2,B00L6AW1XW,"The film opens with two couples celebrating and then the next thing you know there are just two people living in a remote cabin who have barricaded themselves in because of some unknown zombie like infection. Mike (Dean Chekvala) dares to go outside to scrounge for food while his wife Kim (Amy Cale Peterson) stays inside and goes squirrelly from cabin fever. That is the entire film and nearly all of it is filmed from inside the cabin. Two characters, one setting, boring dialogue. It was like watching ""The Road"" as I kept waiting for an explanation or something to happen or the scenery to change.

If you want to watch a zombie film, without zombies, that is character driven, this could be your film. Why someone would make something like that, I have no idea.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, brief sex, brief nudity.",1412121600,2,817,4.706293706293707
6472888,3,B00L6AW1XW,"I'm honestly not sure if I liked this movie or not?!  I was confused as all get out at the end.  I feel that a clearer explanation should have been given, but as far as there only really being 2 cast members, the film holds up surprisingly well.  I guess I could say that I DID ""like"" it, but I really don't see myself watching it again.  I found the filming rather intriguing but couldn't help but constantly pick apart everything knowing that SOMETHING was wrong, but just not knowing exactly what?!  But hey, I guess that's what actually added to it's charm?!

Dean Chekvala (mike) nailed his part!  He was able to make me believe that he was both in love, but total controlling over his wife.  At first, I found his controlling rather unsettling, but as the movie progress, I began to understand more and more as to why he wouldn't ""allow"" her certain freedoms.  Amy Cale Peterson (Kim) on the other hand, while being totally convincing in her role fell short on her ""anger"" scenes.  It seemed to me that she was almost scared to use cuss words?  But that aside, she did a REALLY good job!  I can only imagine how difficult it is to act alone.  Not only in a single scene, but for at least half the movie?!

Final Verdict:  You should check it out!",1412035200,3,1252,4.359307359307359
6472889,5,B00L6AW1XW,A sign of a good movie to me is one that has me gladly debating and thinking about what happened long after the movie is over.  This one had that for me.  The longer we spent with the characters in the cabin the more I sympathized with the cabin fever they were experiencing and just wondering what is really going on outside that cabin and who can you really trust...,1411862400,4,368,4.242857142857143
6472890,1,B00L6AW1XW,"The Dead Within has divided critics with many praising it as a gem of a small film while others consider it simply a snooze-fest that goes nowhere.  Count me among those in the latter group.  Oh, I know what Director Ben Wagner is going for here; I just don't think he succeeds.  99% of the film takes place on a single set with a pair of actors.  Mike and Kim are survivors of a global pandemic who have taken refuge in a remote cabin.  While the word zombie is never uttered it is strongly suggested or at the very least, a viral strain, similar to films like 28 Days Later which turns the infected into homicidal maniacs.

Each day Mike goes out to scavenge for ever-dwindling supplies leaving Kim in the cabin alone.  Before long the isolation and trauma over her dead baby, who became infected, begins to tear at Kims sanity.  She becomes delusional, imagining a park ranger talking to her over their radio but the voice soon turns to taunting Kim over her baby.  Kim and Mikes relationship begins to fracture amidst her mental breakdown as Kim becomes suspicious of Mike and his supply runs.  This leads to a predictable confrontation between the couple in the films climax.  But you will likely be nodding off long before that point if you have not shut it off completely.

Its 91 minute runtime seems at least twice as long as Wagner repeats the daily routine of Mike going out for supplies, Kim remaining in the cabin going crazier by the moment, and Mike returning for dinner.  Clueless Mike cannot seem to recognize that Kim is falling apart with each day but he too, may have been thrown off by the horrendous acting.  The lack of a protagonist also derails the film.  Were told there are infected peopleonce or twice we hear some growls, but we never actually see any of these infected people except in a very brief flashback.  Is the threat actually real or perceived?  Mike returns on a couple of occasions seemingly with the legions of Hell fast on his trail but once he makes it inside the cabinnothing. No pounding or clawing at the door, no shrieking from the infected, just nothing.  When you have a production with a small cast and a tight set, the actors have to be able to carry the action and that is where Dead Within fails.  The leads are stiff, unconvincing, and uninteresting.",1411776000,8,2304,4.548543689320389
6472891,1,B00L6AW1XW,"The first few moments did seem pretty promising and than a flop. All of the four and five stars has to be the promoter or production. It could have been better. We all know that everyone is capable of cracking under pressure, and nonetheless the impulse would turn psychological for most people to live under such conditions as this ""self destruction"" outcome. Don't say it's a zombie film and it's not were going to expect a zombie film. If this film is psychological it should have been the title for peek sake.

This whole movie was shot in a small four wall shack, seriously. NO ZOMBIES? The dog looked scary, guess how? Through a peep whole! It's a waste of money folks. If your interested in seeing two people crack under pressure in one room have at it. If you want a real zombie movie and gore plus self destruction keep moving.

Now I know why it's called ""Dead with in"".",1411776000,4,880,4.459627329192546

The story sounded promising, so did the first few minutes and then...this was the worst most low budget film .Only 2 people in the whole movie =that  only works when you have  a really good quality dialogue/screeenplay and  very talented actors.

6472896,4,B00L6AW1XW,"I liked this film although I thought it was just a little too long. An unnamed plague infects most of mankind and what they become is not pretty. Two of the few, if any, survivors are trapped in an isolated cabin, gradually running out of food and water as well. Although one of them goes out regularly to look for provisions, it's getting more and more difficult to find anything and increasingly dangerous to venture out.  It's utterly claustrophobic and a bit monotonous but what else would life be like if you were certain you'd be killed if you stepped outside into the unknown?

I agree with other reviews that this was a borning movie. My biggest complaint is that the movie is full of holes within the plot. As a viewer you never find out how this ""plague"" was came about, how it spread, is it airborne?  It is inferred that this ""event"" occurred while a group of friends are at a cabin, however, aside from a 2 minute flashback clip you never learn how the friends become infected (did this happen during dinner?) and why the 2 ""survivors"" did not become infected.  The viewer never learns how the baby became infected nor, how how the dog, Teddy, became infected...wait, there is a dog?  The viewer doesn't even realize how the dog fits into the storyline until the credits are rolling and a flashback scene showes us the dog?
