2683729,5,B000K7UBYI,"My twins, both age three, are devoted fans of Dora the Explorer, and Musical School Days delivers more of what they crave - Dora's wide eyed delivery of simple, positive dialogue that encourages them to participate in the story and in the activities of the characters.

Musical School Days does a good job of introducing a lot of Spanish vocabulary and creating situations for the child audience to repeat and use the new words.  We have four Dora DVD's and Musical school is the most popular.",1180828800,24,493,4.72093023255814
