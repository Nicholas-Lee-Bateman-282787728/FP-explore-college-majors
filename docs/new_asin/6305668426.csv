1065035,5,6305668426,THE MOVIS IS BASICALLY ABOUT 3 FRIENDS THAT GREW UP IN THE WOOD..INGLEWOOD THAT IS.

It definitely took me back to the days when all those great R&B songs were out and to my first crush and first boyfriend, etc. This  movie just put together a whole bunch of good looking black people into a  story that's not about violence or any kind of negativity, just pure fun;  it's what life is all about for those of us who appreciate but can't fully  relate to life in the hood. It was so much fun. I loved every minute of it.  The story was great; the acting was convincing, the plot was realistic and  it's a movie I will always think about with a huge grin on my face. Two  thumbs way up in my book!",948412800,36,698,3.9784172661870505

I don't mind seeing black actors, but these fellows lacked the finesse of a Sidney Poitier or Billie Dee Williams. The producers and directors of these movies need to make more discerning judgments of who they pick for the parts and roles that are created by a script. I would not pay fifty cents to see this garbage. I hope my one star review changes the bell curve on this movie.

1066884,4,6305668426,"Though Ive seen The Wood in .gif sets and random mentions, due to it being released during the great Black renaissance of film in the 90s, it was never really on my radar. If just because, for one, I was born in the early 90s, and also because between The Best Man, Jasons Lyric, Love & Basketball, and many others, those films were the ones set on a pedestal and heralded as some of the best Black movies of the 90s, if not ever. Making you wonder if The Wood just got swept up because there was so many good movies that what it provided was more so normal than exemplary, or if maybe it was a disappointment? Hence why despite Omar Epps, Taye Diggs, and Sanaa Lathan being in it, their other movies from the 90s are the go to ones when you bring their names up.

Characters & Story

The story splits the focus between Mike (Omar Epps/ Sean Nelson), Slim (Richard T. Jones/ Duane Finley), and Roland (Taye Diggs/ Trent Cameron). As adults, the focus is Rolands upcoming marriage to Lisa (LisaRaye McCoy) which he is getting cold feet about. To the point he goes to Tanyas (Tamala Jones) house, the woman who was his first love, after getting ridiculously drunk. From there, the boys reminisce about how far they have come, when they were making bets about grabbing girls booties, getting the most numbers, or who would lose their virginity first, to becoming men. Though when the film focuses on the past, Roland isn't the featured character but Mike. Which leads to an about even split between the movie focusing on Rolands problems in the present, and Mikes relationship with his boys, as well as his love interest Alicia (Sanaa Lathan/ Malinda Williams). Making for an interesting take on the coming-of-age sub-genre.

Praise

Before I watched this movie, I didn't see The Wood as one of the best films with a Black majority cast, from the 90s or ever, but I felt my opinion was instantly changed as soon as the jokes started rolling in. For with Mike and Slim breaking the 4th wall, and not taking any of Rolands BS, and them cracking jokes on each other, you see a beautiful brotherhood. One which likely suffered some trials and tribulations, but overall I don't think these men could think of anyone else they would want to share their joy or pain with.

As for their younger selves, to me that is where the best parts of the movie come from. If just because it seems so rare to find coming of age stories featuring young Black or Brown people which doesnt have heavy handed topics like we saw in Precious or Pariah. And while Alicias brother was a Blood, there isn't some overdone examinations of gang culture and all that. These young men are just horny teens who want to get with a cute girl, and for Mike, make love to the one who really mattered.

Criticism

Leading to perhaps the sole issues I have with this movie: Taye Diggs and the storyline of the adult versions of Mike, Slim and Roland. You see, in the film, as noted, the present day features Roland getting cold feet and getting drunk. Something which Taye Diggs doesnt play well in a comical, nor deep, way at all. In fact, he comes off so annoying you really do hope Slim will punch him in the face. Though what is the real problem with Roland is that he seems like an odd person to focus on. If just because Mike is the focus of their early years together and during that time Roland, much less Slim, aren't developed to the point you feel like you should give a damn about them as adults. Also, what doesnt help is Mike is so likable and charismatic that honestly it makes you question why in the adult years are we focused on Roland marrying Lisa? Especially when, after who knows how many years, Mike is getting to see Alicia for the first time. And with their relationship being built up so much when they were kids, the little we get to see when they are adults seems like a wasted opportunity. Add on us meeting Tanya, Rolands first love, and us not fully understanding why they broke up, much less why Roland and Lisa got together, and honestly it makes the story of the adults pale in comparison to what their younger selves have for a story.

Overall: TV Viewing

While certainly the films which are better remembered, and more often named, aren't without issues, they are a bit more consistent. And, in all honestly, despite The Best Man coming out after this movie, this honestly seems like the type of film which wasted a good story that Malcom D. Lee just so happened to have already planned to capitalize on. For getting cold feet before marriage, and having drama on the way to the altar, is a good premise. Especially when you add in this idea of the best man trying to make sure one of their close friends make it to the alter; however, between the kids having a better story than the adults, and Roland being a terrible focus considering how much Mike was built up, I have to label this as TV Viewing. For while the problems of the film certainly don't make this something which shouldnt be considered a classic, it is just the main plot it sort-of focuses on was sadly done better months after its release.",1410652800,,5101,4.470461868958109

The cast is really what makes the movie, from the warm and mature performances of the three friends and their classmates as we watch them go through high school together, to the strong and sexy performances of the best friends as young men, grown and moving up but still (which is another key positive for me) remembering the bond with your past.

1067535,5,6305668426,"The Wood is a funny and heartwarming coming of age film that uses its all star cast effectively instead of wasting them like movies these days tend to do.

The Story: Roland(Taye Diggs) is having cold feet on his wedding day and his friends, Mike(Omar Epps) and Slim(Richard T. Jones) try to help him get over it. While they help him overcome his anxiety of getting married, Mike recalls their younger years growing up in Inglewood California. Mike recalls how he first met Slim and Roland and his childhood love Alicia(Malinda Williams).

Taye Diggs, Omar Epps and Richard T. Jones are all great. The chemistry they have together makes the movie fun as it moves along. There are a lot of funny moments in this movie(when Mike gets beat up by Alicia's brother, The vomit scene,Mike dancing with a plush toy bunny and the dance scene when Mike rises to the occasion and tries to play it off) and some warm moments.

What I like the most about The Wood is its brutal honesty. The people in this movie are realistically portrayed(just like most of Rick Famuyiwa's movies). Now I know most prudes are going to detest how these boys in this movie act but just remember one thing: THEY ARE KIDS! If this movie would have had these youngsters thinking about anything other than girls it wouldn't be realistic. Movies that show us human beings as imperfect will always get slammed by pseudo-intellectual bourgeoisie puppets but who cares what they think.

In conclusion The Wood is an excellent coming-of-age movie that is necessary requirement for any fan of Black Cinema. Two Thumbs up.",1258416000,2,1580,4.755474452554744

I'm very unhappy with my purchase.  My recommendation to you is that you read every single piece of information before you purchase movies that were formatted for another country.  This is the catch when you buy movies at cheaper prices.",1146787200,6,407,4.704225352112676
1067729,3,6305668426,"It's good to see the variety of newer, unexplored subject matters that movies like these tried valiantly to portray back in 1999.

Particularly if you like the refreshing comedy angle TV shows like ""Everybody Hates Chris"" uses, you'll more than likely get into this movie.

""The Wood"" is another buppie (Black Urban Professional)/black middle class slice of life/coming of age kind of movie.

It's decent enough with a solid story line, good acting and good writing though I'd recommend seeing 1997's Soul Food, 2000's Love & Basketball, 2002's Brown Sugar and 1997's Love Jones before watching this one.

Aside from seeing a good black movie where the focus isn't on race, violence or some grim circumstance (althouth these films do have a significant place), the only truly special moments I took away from this film were a couple of unforgettable catchphrases.

I won't give them away.  Watch this and you'll know what I'm talking about when you hear them.

If you or anyone in your circle is the kind of person that's always throwin' up timeless funny movie quotes, this is another one that's got some unforgettable gems.

Other than that, unfortunately, I don't think ""The Wood"" will be talked about that much in say 10 years.

Nothing groundbreaking here.",1144800000,2,1261,4.966666666666667

1067731,5,6305668426,"If anyone ever wants to see a great movie then they should go to see The Wood. The wood is one of the most funny movies that I have ever seen. It is a great comedy but at the same time it is a good love story. The wood is a movie that will have you laughing and feeling all romantic at the same time. There are a number of things about this movie that makes it better than others.

 If you are a person who enjoys new movies that are set in a different time settings then the wood is for you.  The wood will take you back. It will have you reminiscing about your adolescent years. The wood is set in the 1980's in Inglewood California. It is about three teens who grew up at a time when gang activity was really high. Still the movie still remains to be very comedic.

 The wood is such a good movie because most of the people who watch the movie can relate to it. The characters in this movie go through things that most people have gone through.

 There was a line in this movie that summed up how most teenage guys think.  The line was ""I'll never be tide down to one woman. For the rest of my I'll be mackin and hangin.""

 The wood is a very good movie. It is a very good movie because it makes the watcher think about their teenage years. Most people who watch this movie can relate to it. Over all the wood is a great movie to see.  I urge any person who wants to see a good movie to go and see it.",1114128000,3,1404,3.9257950530035335

Omar Epps and Taye Diggs headline this amusing tale.  Oh what adventures these guys had while growing up in Inglewood.  One can truly see the struggles that Mike had as a new kid fitting in.

Its a little odd that the flashbacks were so much from the point of view of Mike rather than Rolland.  The excessive cussing can drain on the nerves as well.  However, the amusing adventures of the trio of Rolland, Mike, and Slim outweigh any drawbacks.",1097625600,3,590,4.669902912621359

The Wood does exactly this as it shows friends, who generally care for one another and their life through school and into adulthood.  I commend this movie because it is correct.  I had so many of these experiences.  I love the bully scene and hitting the girl butt, and his uncertainity of getting married.

I my for this movie is so strong. when it first came out on dvd I watched it at least 4 times a day for like three times a Months.

1067847,3,6305668426,"The Wood was undoubtedly a comeback for MTV Films. (Do you know anybody who saw Joe's Apartment?) It's the story of three men: Roland (Taye Diggs), Slim (Richard T. Jones) and Mike (Omar Epps), who have been friends since youth. At one point Roland, who never considered settling down EVER, had planned to marry his girlfriend, but on the big day he is nowhere to be found. As Mike and Slim search for him, they reminisce on the day they first met. Roland and Slim had already known each other, and Mike was the new guy at school. In order to fit in, he would do basically anything Roland and Slim told him, including going after Alicia, the best-looking girl in school. After going the wrong way in doing that, Alicia's gangbanging brother Stacey goes after him, but that subsides, and for some reason Mike and Alicia become friends.
Back in the present, Mike and Slim finally track down Roland, who has such cold feet that he is now drunk out of his mind. After he gets cleaned up, the three of them go shopping, which spurs another memory: when they were at the school dance. Roland and Slim made up a contest for who could get the most girls' phone numbers. Mike went along with it unenthusiastically, for the only girl he was interested in was Alicia. He did end up getting her number, and her number alone. Although Roland and Slim ended up getting several girls' numbers, they both agreed that Mike's one number was bigger than all their numbers combined.
Later on they hold another contest...for who can lose their virginity first. Roland and Slim lost theirs with no trouble. Mike lost his as well, to Alicia, but he didn't tell them about it because he decided it was more important than a contest.
This movie was good, but there were a few things wrong with it. Roland was the former womanizer, and Roland was the guy getting married. So why did all the flashbacks revolve around Mike? Also, we know Roland was drunk, but the regurgitation scene was a little too graphic. He was throwing up nonstop for a full minute. Still, this is one of the better black movies I've seen. Just don't compare it to Soul Food or Love & Basketball.",1020384000,3,2142,4.537467700258398

Taye Diggs and Omar Epps star, but the real winners are the actors who play the younger version of their characters.  LisaRaye also makes a nice appearance as the fiancee.  Unfortunately, this gets a 3-star rating mainly because there are virtually no extras on this package.  All we get is a trailer.  No documentary.  No interview.

1067907,5,6305668426,"I am a black Englishwoman and saw this video with two of my four brothers and my cousin (she was visiting from the U.S.). I have to say that it was  one of the best evenings we could remember. We laughed so much, not only  because of the dialogue and its brilliant delivery, but also in total  recognition of ourselves in these characters. Yes! Even over the pond in  London our childhoods were eerily similar to those portrayed in this funny,  honest and affectionate look back at the mid-eighties and how it shaped our  futures. I actually wanted more - to know what happened at college, etc and  I certainly wanted to see the 'happy-ever-after'. As all of the other  reviewers have pointed out, it does make a change to see a movie with  strong performances about ordinary lives. Of course the drugs and violence  exist, but not everyone can relate to it and people shouldn't have to have  it thrust in their faces every single time they want to see a movie about/  concerning black people (international). Thank God for the Spike  Lee-inspired new wave making films like this, The Best Man, Love Jones,  Soul Food. Now white people have even less reason for failing to get to  know us as equals with the same highs, lows and loves as any other race.  These films will all be added to my home collection for repeated viewing.  One of my other brothers will be getting it for his birthday and the other,  I'm sure, is smiling down from Heaven at this fantastic film.",969408000,,1468,4.517110266159696
1067908,4,6305668426,"This is one of those movies that takes you back.  It takes you back to the  moments you spent being one or all of hte characters represented growing  up.  It takes you back to the wretched, laughable moments of puberty where  the changes in your body- in your head if nothing else- changed the shape  of your life and the status- and amount- of your friends.  And it takes you  forward into the realization that those moments of insecurity and epiphany  that are the hallmarks of your youth follow you right into the major life  changes of your adulthood.
I personally would have liked it more if there  was another sub-plot to compliment the one of Taye Diggs' character coming  to terms with his adult choice and love decision- mariage- and the fear it  inevitably brings up. Something like divorce in one of their families, or  the death of a friend, making them a trio insytead of the quartet they  could possibly have been.  For me, it would have made the overarching theme  and messages much stronger and not fed into the somewhat stereotypical view  that only men are afraid of weddings, for no apparent reason.  But the  movie scored for me regardless; it has enough laughable truths and tender  moments between young men to carry you right through to the end.

After seeing this Omar Epps has gone up another level on my acting list, same thing for Taye Diggs.  Sanaa Lathan didn't have a big  part as I thought she was going to, but her pretty face was enough.  I  thought young Mike was a real good actor and that he needs to play in more  movies.  I was born in the 80's so I don't know what it was like being a  teenager then b/c i am one now, but I can relate to how the characters at.  It's a movie that will be timeless and last forever b/c it doesn't matter  what kind of neighborhood you're from it still deals with camaraderie and  friendship till the end.  That's the main theme that really surfaced at the  end and at the wedding.  Well, I thought this movie was really good and I  was glad that it didn't have to deal with drugs b/c that's been played out  and black casts and directors need to start thinking of movies that have  more substance to them.
