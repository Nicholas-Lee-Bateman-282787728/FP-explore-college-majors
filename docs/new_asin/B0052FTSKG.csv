I really like how you can create your own workout routine and put it all in the order that you prefer.",1280188800,,210,4.146341463414634

4529994,5,B0052FTSKG,"If you are not one for general aerobics however want to get fit using a workout video this is a fun way to do it.
If you love sports this is great.",1279411200,,147,3.625
4529995,5,B0052FTSKG,"Just received this DVD yesterday and tried it out, I wasn't sure how much I was going to feel it based on one of the reviews I read...but man, my heart was pumping and I was sweating like crazy, as if I just did a spinning class!  Definitely sore today (the day after)!!  I like how it's sports related moves, the soccer and track and field sections are good!  I also like the special ""booty bonus"", you can definitely feel it working your glutes!  So, I'd recommend this!  I love Kendra!",1279238400,17,488,4.318681318681318
4529996,4,B0052FTSKG,"I will be the first to admit that I am not a big fan of Kendra.  I typically find her to be the most annoying of the three Girls Next Door.  She didn't do much to help my view of her in this DVD.  I felt like she was trying too hard to be cute and came off a little fake except in the bonus ""booty"" section.  That was the only time I felt like she was being real.

Even though I'm not a fan of Kendra, I saw the preview video Amazon had up and it actually looked like it would be a lot of fun, so I gave it a shot....and I was surprised.

The sections are very short and go by quickly since the exercises are done in 30 second intervals.  For some 30 seconds feels just right and for others 30 seconds is too short.  I'm actually used to doing interval training in minute intervals so for the most part it ended up being a little easier than what I'm used to although I haven't done personal trainer style interval training in some time (thus why 30 seconds for some exercises felt just right).

I've mentioned in another review that I have wrist issues which made part of the Track & Field section impossible for me to do (unfortunately).  There is an exercise in Football that also requires going down to the floor but it is manageable.  That being said, the Kickboxing, Soccer and Basketball sections I found to be the most fun.

Other than fact that Kendra comes off a little fake at times, I felt that the time between the sections was a little slow and gave me too much time to rest, even though I was jogging in place the whole time.  There is handful of jumping exercises so if you live on the second floor of an apartment building, like I do, you can't jump as high as you'd like without upsetting your neighbors.  Kendra changes outfits for each section and even though she says she's ""tired"" and even takes a break a couple of times, it is very obvious that she isn't as tired as she's pretending to be, but that's OK.  In the warm up her trainer becomes slightly annoying by counting to three before each stretch is done, but the counting is nice during the intervals.  They do preview the moves for you so you do know what you're going to be doing which is a nice touch.

I know it sounds like I'm giving it a negative review, but all of the things I hate about the DVD don't really matter because I enjoyed the actual workout so much.  The sections go by fast and by the time you start to get tired the intervals are over.  I'd really like to give it 3.5 stars but since I don't have that option, I went with 4 because I do think that a lot of people would have fun doing it.  I just hope that if she ends up making a second DVD that it is more challenging (45-60 second intervals) but equally as fun.",1278806400,3,2715,4.1254752851711025
4529997,4,B0052FTSKG,I preordered this disc because I knew Kendra would come across as her fun loving self even while exercising.  I was right!  And the different sports segments topped it off; they really were fun; I actually enjoyed working out!,1278720000,,226,4.769230769230769
4529998,5,B0052FTSKG,This video was worth every penny! I didn't know what I'd get -- she isn't a fitness professional and doesn't make workout tapes for a living but i just love the fact that she is REAL and has a can-do attitude. I love it more than I love tapes made by workout pros. This was great if you are looking for a cardio-only workout. The time flew by.,1278201600,,343,4.0588235294117645
4529999,4,B0052FTSKG,"I'm an at-home fitness dvd addict and own over 100 different styles from old-school Cindy Crawford to Tamilee Webb to Tracy Anderson...Kendra's dvd is divided into five simple 6 minute sections with different themes (basketball, football, soccer, etc.). The moves are very easy to follow and Kendra has a refreshing honest can-do spirit but for an intermediate to advanced exerciser the program lacks weights, toning and anything particularly innovative or challenging. There is NO use of free weights or bands or other toning equipment....even on my first try of the video I added 5lb weights and a 4lb fitness ball to use on the basketball section (if you're a bit creative incorporating weights is not too difficult and really increases the burn).

This video is primarily for newbie exercisers who want a fun albeit simple cardio program.",1277337600,39,842,5.145985401459854
4530000,5,B0052FTSKG,this is a great workout dvd. i felt a great burn and sure did sweat the first time i did it. and can not wait to do it again. i plan on doing it every day. thank you so much Kendra and Nick for making this workout dvd.,1277164800,5,218,3.5625
4530001,5,B0052FTSKG,"It's perfect for burning off calories & getting your body ready for more challenging workouts. I had gained a lot of weight from a series of events, this DVD along with a low carb diet helped me shed of 88 lbs & get back on track. If you're already fit & looking for a challenge there are billions of tapes out there for you. This one is for those of you who got out of shape & are ready to get back in shape.  They don't splice it to where you're watching a super stud doing a perfect marathon of which you can't keep up.. She & her eye candy coach made this enjoyable. She did this after her son was born & still had a little (very little) weight left to shed.",1393977600,,662,3.9774436090225564
4530002,5,B0052FTSKG,"I really do love this workout-I skip the kickboxing segment,as many reviewers said it was too easy,but the sports segments are so much fun! I get real sweaty but Kendra and her trainer are so much fun that I enjoy doing this even on days I have zero motivation. I also like the short segments that I can mix and match-this one is a winner!",1390608000,,339,4.230769230769231

4530006,5,B0052FTSKG,"If anyone missed out when BE A KNOCKOUT WITH KENDRA's series was initially released, I highly recommend it. Kendra's routine is more realistic than Tracy Anderson's back breaking routine. Plus, trainer Nicky Holender is gorgeous!",1368144000,,229,5.571428571428571
4530007,5,B0052FTSKG,"Out of all my workout DVDs this is slam down my favourite. I have difficulty looking graceful when I use dance videos due to having been it by a car and thrown thirty feet in the air. With Kendra I do not have to look graceful I just have to move, puch and kick. I love it! I also love that I can choose which section I want to do. I started with warmup and one sport, now I do three sports. I like it that I do not have to jump right into a thirty minute workout. I do however agree with another comment, the warm up is cheesy.",1367452800,,528,3.809090909090909
4530008,5,B0052FTSKG,"I just love Kendra to begin with and I love working out, so this was a win-win for me.  The menu options that allow you to customize your workout are awesome!  I always finish the DVD covered in sweat and exhausted.  it's a must buy.  The customized workout also allows you to not get bored and do the same thing every time.",1364342400,,324,4.17741935483871
4530009,5,B0052FTSKG,This DVD is just what I was looking for. I do it several times a week now. It was also an excellent price and arrived well before I was expecting it.,1363910400,,149,3.838709677419355
4530010,4,B0052FTSKG,"I really like this workout but I wish it was a little more intense. I also like that it is different. Sometimes I get a little bored with workout DVDs, but not this one.",1361318400,,169,4.0
4530011,5,B0052FTSKG,"I love this workout video!  I have done so many other excercise videos: zumba, turbo jam, denise austin, etc. but none seem to have the effectiveness of this one.  This one makes me feel a difference and works much better than any other for me to get in shape.
I did this video a couple of times a week for about a month or two before my wedding and it helped me tone up and lose some weight without dieting.
If you like a sports type workout than this is for you.  It is not dancey, it is definitely a ""sports cardio""/interval type workout, and you will feel it afterwards if you put your energy into it.
It is broken up into short segments (5-6 minutes) of different sports excercises(soccer, basketball, football, track & field, kickboxing) and then 30 second intervals within each of those, so the time passes quickly and there is enough variety to keep it interesting and not get bored.
I like Nicky as the sports trainer (good looking soccer player with an English accent :) )and Kendra is funny.
I highly recommend this video!",1360540800,,1033,4.48404255319149
4530012,4,B0052FTSKG,"This was pretty much what I expected it to be (super corny) but additionally it was an awesome workout!!  It was definitely challenging but each ""move"" is only 30 seconds, so it's over almost as soon as it's getting really tough.  Plus each segment is only 6 minutes long, so each segment feels pretty easy, and makes you want to go ahead and combine all of the segments.  I definitely got my heart rate and body heat up.  It's super cheesy, but that's what I expected and part of the fun!

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because sometimes it seems unfinished or unprofessional.  During some of the moves when only Kendra is doing them and the trainer is pointing out what to do, she will stop and interrupt to laugh in the middle of the set.  Also, I felt like some of the sets were missing 1 or 2 reps.  Pretty annoying... But overall it's a great workout.",1359936000,,871,4.300613496932515
4530013,5,B0052FTSKG,I loved how this video had short segments that you could do one at a time or back to back. With a baby it was easy for me to get a quick workout in and entertain a little one with my moves.,1357171200,,189,3.5238095238095237
4530014,5,B0052FTSKG,Great workout because you can pick and choose which ones you want to do.  She mixes it up and keeps it fun!,1356652800,,107,3.8636363636363638
4530015,4,B0052FTSKG,"I love to workout and wanted to involve my kids in my excercise, so I chose this video.  It has been great for all of us, experienced and beginer.  All of the moves are heart pumping athletic moves.  It's plenty to give me a great workout, yet the moves are basic enough for the kids to be able to get a good workout as well.",1354665600,,325,3.9692307692307693
4530016,5,B0052FTSKG,"I love Kendra anyway. I think she is a positive person, she is beautiful, fun, funny, and has such a zest for life.  I enjoy her work out.  It is cardio, no floor work. so not alot of toning, just alot of sweating and heart pumping to get your blood flowing and burn fat and calories.  she is just entertaining and fun to listen to and to watch.  Good work out.  It is sports orientated. they go thru different sports and modify exercises kinda relating to each sport (example,. football and soccor and basketball)",1342310400,2,514,4.425531914893617
4530017,1,B0052FTSKG,"She is so annoying and fake that I couldn't even finish the DVD.  Maybe if I muted it, I would be able to handle it.",1339372800,,116,3.64
4530018,5,B0052FTSKG,"I love this workout DVD! I've been on-again/off-again over the past couple years and it still motivates me.  There are 6 different workouts all which are about 6-7 minutes long, which is great because I always feel like I've accomplished more when each is done and if I only have a limited time to workout, I can still fit in 3 workouts in under 20 min.  It's true that it's not super hard so I can see extreme fitness lovers not liking it but I yo-yo within 10-15 lbs and each time I get back into this DVD I lose the weight, tone up and never get bored or exhausted.",1338336000,2,568,4.154545454545454
4530019,5,B0052FTSKG,"I know some people didn't give a good review on this, but I must admit I love this dvd! I wish that I could attach pics of myself that I took when I started this Dvd 4 weeks ago vs a pic a took yesterday! I had my son back in April 2010, and only weighed 131 the day he was born. I've since dropped without any exercise to 117, but struggled with ""back fat"" rolls and a muffin top.

I have been working out to this dvd 5 days a week and have lost several inches already and you can tell a huge difference! I do the work out 5 days a week, plus I have been doing 200 crunches and 25 push ups.

I love Kendra's show, but I will say like others that she is a little annoying on this dvd. She looks off screen a lot and says annoying things. I just either ignore it or I mute it and turn music on depending on the day lol. Everything is sports related, other than the Booty Bonus (which is amazing, and not hard at all!). You can choose to do a few segments and then take a break and pace yourself, which I did the first week.

If you are looking to lose a lot of weight, I don't know if I would suggest it. If you are not worried about numbers and looking to get rid of a muffin top and tone your body up, I would 100% say this is the dvd for you! Really great to lose baby weight!",1327881600,3,1278,3.7969924812030076
4530020,5,B0052FTSKG,"I just finished my first workout with this dvd, and was pleasantly surprised!  I first decided to make the purchase based on the other reviews I read on this site.  It almost doesn't matter if you're a Kendra fan or not, because she definitely acts like a real person during the workouts (getting exhausted, not acting like every exercise will be easy, etc.), but also not a whiner.  She actually motivated me to work for it!  Since she had baby Hank, her body is still a work in progress, and something I think most women will love to see :)  I hate looking at women who have perfect figures in workout dvds!  For some reason it's less motivating for me.  But thats just me.

I like the fact that each workout is separated into 6 mins each, plus the warm up and cool down.  It goes by fast!  Plus the awesome feature that you can customize your own workout made me pretty happy because you can constantly mix things up to confuse your muscles :)  I was also happy that these exercises were a challenge, but also very doable!  And afterwards you don't feel like your going to pass out.  I felt refreshed and invigorated!  I used to work out a few days a week this past spring and summer but had a long break!  This was my first workout since then, and was happy that I could finish the dvd!

I loved that I didn't feel like I was killing myself in the exercises!  They didn't have push ups, sit ups, etc (stuff I hate).  No floor work!  Just be prepared to do lunges and hopping around.  The only floor work you have to do is the bonus booty exercises, and even those aren't a pain to do :)  After you finish the dvd you FEEL IT!  In a good way.

Like my mom says, ""Any workouts will work, as long as you stick with it!""  How true that is, and this DVD really makes me feel like it won't be a chore to do a few times a week.  If you just watch your eating (like I have to) and do this DVD a few times a week, you should get in great shape!",1323043200,,1939,4.093085106382978
4530021,4,B0052FTSKG,Great video. Great workout for my buns! I have tried several work out videos in the past and haven't had interest in sticking with it. Kendra makes it fun and keeps me motivated! Thank you Kendra,1317772800,,195,4.444444444444445
4530022,4,B0052FTSKG,"I received this DVD a few weeks ago and was slacking at starting it, today was my first time doing it. I just had a baby one year ago and have not really done any good workouts. Well, I can say that this really got my heart pumping and had me feeling like passing out!!! Man! I'm glad I purchased it and do recommend it to all new mommas...I want to keep the extra weight because I was always underweight with no curves, now I have some curves but just want to tone them up a little, I think this dvd will do it! =)",1317081600,,515,3.914285714285714

4530024,4,B0052FTSKG,"I orginally got this dvd because i am a fan of Kendra. I love her bubbly and fun personality!
When i ordered it, i thought it would be a light easy workout! Its not supper hard but its not supper easy either. Its just in the middle.
Four things i really like is:
1.) She is bubbly throughout the whole workout but is still like any other women and sometimes has hard with certain moves
2.) her and her trainer (nicky) have a great relationship and he actually use to be on the same socccer team as David beckahuam
3.) its based on sports but is still really fun even if your not into sports (like me)
4.) you can costumes design your workout (chose which workouts you wanna do and in the order) or you can just do them all.
If you get this dvd make sure to do the booty bonus (my favorite part of the workout)",1310515200,,809,4.09433962264151
4530025,5,B0052FTSKG,"Kendra says in the video, I'm going to help you kick your own ass, and that's exactly what she does.  I felt like I was getting results immediately.  The different agility moves she uses are a lot of fun and they bring me back to my days of playing sports.  If you don't like the order she uses, you can customize it to the order you like.  All around I think it's great!  Some might compare it to the ""insanity"" workout, I believe it has similarities, but it is probably a little easier, but you can make it as intense as you want, that's what's so great about it! Definitely LOVE IT!!",1307923200,,586,4.196428571428571

Sorry Kendra but this is a joke next to Jillian Michaels workouts! I bearly broke a sweat and each of the moves wasn't even done long enough to even feel the burn or your muscles working at all! This is a great workout for women 80 years older and up! I gave it 3 stars because i think Kendra is great, is a great inspiration and has done a great job losing all her baby weight. But c'mon people, lets be real, we've all seen her show and she did not do this workout to lose all that weight! (like they say she did in the  workout dvd) You will probably lose some weight (not much), along with some serious dieting doing this dvd but if you are looking for a real workout to get some serious results, Jillian Michaels kicks your ass!!!",1301011200,3,908,4.129943502824859

4530032,4,B0052FTSKG,"I bought this about a month ago & I'm enjoying it. There's a bit of a cheesiness factor, but if you ever watched The Girls Next Door without getting annoyed you'll be fine. The music isn't that great, but the moves aren't complicated so you can always mute the audio & workout to your iPod. The sports drills give you a great cardio workout that's time efficient. There are 5 different segments (football, basketball, soccer, track & field, kickboxing) plus a booty workout that you can mix and match. Each segment is broken up into 30 second intervals, which makes it great for beginners. You'll work hard without over-exerting yourself (I tried Jillian Michaels & could barely function the next day). If you're at an intermediate or advanced fitness level, you won't break a sweat with this unless you do the entire workout- try P90X or something!

I've tried many dvds and the thing I like about this is it is a good workout but it stops just when you think you cant do it anymore. so if your like me and just starting out this is a great workout. If you cant keep up with them then you just stop and run in place as they suggest. I think its great and feel great after just 2 days of doing part of it. you can also customize it and pick which workouts you want to do also. It includes all the sports type exercises you see players doing. Love it and this one is a keeper. Great job Kendra!!,1297382400,,681,3.8714285714285714

4530039,4,B0052FTSKG,"awesome dvd. Kendra is a great work out buddy. The trainer is HOT. Great aussie accent. Makes the time fly. The moves can be challenging, but not impossible to do. Great workout. Felt it the next day!",1291507200,,200,4.4324324324324325
4530040,4,B0052FTSKG,"I originally looked into this DVD because I am a huge Girls Next Door fan and thought that doing Kendra's workout would make exercising more tolerable. Additionally, I wanted a fun workout to do on the days that I didn't feel like going to the gym. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this workout.

I like to challenge myself when it comes to these types of things, so I always do the whole DVD from start to finish, and by the time I'm done I am wiped. This is a perfect workout if you want to stay at home but really get your heart rate going with some cardio. I use it on the days when I have a lot of energy and want to break up the normal routine. I was always an athletic girl so the whole theme of integrating sports with working out really grabbed my attention.

If you're interested in buying this DVD, I say do it. If you're looking for a fun way to mix up the usual routine every here and there- this is it.",1291334400,,923,4.065934065934066

Last season, I saw the episode where she was having a hard time losing the baby weight, which was hard to believe being that she's a celebrity. It made me feel as if she's  just another person (not famous) which encouraged me to buy this workout video. I enjoy this video, it allows you to customize your workout and it also has the booty bonus workout (really works). I recommend this video to those who want lose those extra pounds and also to support Kendra!",1289952000,2,517,4.385416666666667

4530044,4,B0052FTSKG,"I didn't expect much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a great, low impact, cardio workout. Kendra is her usual goofy self.  I didn't mind the banter between she and her trainer b/c it made the time go by fast.  I especially liked the option to customize your own workout by selecting the segments in the order you prefer (I arrange them from easiest to hardest).",1284940800,2,378,4.529411764705882
4530045,5,B0052FTSKG,"I had a baby 3 years ago now and gained 50 lbs throughout my pregnancy.  Although I lost all of the extra weight within 6 months of having my baby, I gained about 20 lbs back when I stopped breastfeeding.  I have tried SO many different workout videos and exercises to lose these extra stubborn pounds and tone up but nothing seemed to really make me want to do it again.  I just purchased Be a Knockout with Kendra mainly because I love watching her show and I think that she has a great energy but also because I saw how great she looked after only a few months of having baby Hank.  After only one time of doing the exercises in the video I honestly already feel my legs and butt getting toned.  The moves are so easy but you can feel them working as you're doing the video!  I especially liked the football section of the video because it was fun and I could really tell that the moves were helping to tone my legs and butt!  I HIGHLY suggest this video to anyone who is trying to lose a few lbs and really tone their body!",1284681600,3,1027,4.130653266331659
4530046,4,B0052FTSKG,"I really liked the video. I was able to keep up even though it had been while since I had worked out. I'll not really a girly type of person, but wanted to get into shape not look like a bodybuilder. The routine was easy and could complete all of the exercises within an hour. If you don't have a whole hour to workout you can pick the exercises that work best for you.  There are only 2 things that I did not like about the video.  You do have to keep the remote close by as at the end of each exercise it goes back to the menu and you have to select the next exercise. This isn't too bad, as you can grab a sip of water during this time. And the second thing, Kendra's trainer just kept talking about how great Kendra was. She is his favorite celebrity and he repeats it several times over the course of the video. For the most part the video is fun and I really like doing it and have already seen results.",1283385600,,909,3.989010989010989
4530047,4,B0052FTSKG,"I have watched GND and Kendra's show even though she can be quite annoying. What intrigued me about this video is that it's centered around sports. I love sports and was hoping to find something that I could do in the mornings to start motivating me to work out more. I found exactly what I was looking for.

As others stated, it consists of 5 sports-themed workouts that are approximately 6 minutes each. Although that sounds like nothing, the moves are intense so you definitely feel it. The warm up is cheesy and the kickboxing portion isn't very challenging so please don't judge the DVD on that alone and turn it off. Track and Field was really difficult for me because by that time I was so winded and my legs were killing me that I could barely attempt it! There are no weights incorporated but if people need more of a challenge, they can add ankle/hand weights or even hold some weights in your hands. I definitely don't need that just yet.

What I really like about this DVD is that you can customize your workout. I have soooo many workout DVDs and I get annoyed when I want to skip around but have to go back to the main menu, select the workout, wait out the 'consult a physician blah blah blah' before I can begin. By that time my heart rate has gone back to regular! With this, you can pick which workouts you want to do, hit 'begin workout' and they play in succession! Another thing I appreciated is that during some of the moves, Kendra can't even complete them. Even when she does, she's breathing just as heavily as some of us probably are. In some of my other workout videos, the instructor goes nonstop and barely breaks a sweat sometimes. Meanwhile, I'm gulping water like my life depends on it, sweating like crazy and panting like a dog in heat! So that was nice to see!

The dialog between Kendra and the trainer is highly annoying. It's very forced. She also looks off camera a lot so I'm not sure if she's reading queue cards or looking at the baby because apparently he was there. As I do this more, I'll probably just put the tv on mute!

I did the video yesterday and was definitely sore this morning but not 'I can't get out of the bed' sore. It was very rewarding. So much so that I was motivated to get up and do it again this morning.

I would definitely give it a try.",1281484800,15,2304,4.324074074074074
4530048,4,B0052FTSKG,"I tried&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Be-A-Knockout-with-Kendra/dp/B003NVSNTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Be A Knockout with Kendra</a>&nbsp;for the first time last night.  I was pretty skeptical at first, but after viewing the preview of it on Amazon I thought it looked upbeat and fun.  It was delivered on Tuesday, so I decided to try it out last night.

Overall, the workout was great.  It left me feeling sweaty, tired, and motivated to do more!  The DVD comes with 6 sports themed segments.  I think each segment is around 5-6 minutes in length, plus there is a warm-up and cool down.  You can choose to 'create your own' workout and mix and match segments, or you can 'play all' and do the complete workout.  I chose the complete workout option.

The warm-up was pretty easy and Kendra and the trainer laugh and joke most of the time.  The first segment was kickboxing and it was very easy.  Very low energy puches and kicks and not much cardio other than the 'base move', which is jogging in place.  I was beginning to be skeptical, but by the time I got through the 3rd segment I wanted to turn the DVD off.  No, not because I was bored... because I wasn't sure I could make it through another segment.

Though I , unfortunately, can't say I am the most fit person out there.. this workout defininitely was uncomfortable towards the end.  It pushed my cardio and strength to the next level.

Basically, if you can get past the fact that Kendra is in this workout and don't mind her forced comments or smile... this is a really effective and fun sports themed workout.

Here is a summary of my review:

Pro's:

Lots of options for workouts with the chaptered index and 'create your own' feature
Total workout is less than 40 mins for all segments
Good cardio conditioning
Ok strength conditioning using own body weight
Fun sports related drills
Con's:

Slow pace in the warm-up and kickbox segments
Kendra does a 'silly' base move (ie some type of booty shake) during each segment
Kendra says "" If I can do it, you can do it!"" (insert fake smile) over and over and over and over
Other general 'Kendra-isms'

It is really hard for me to find a cardio workout dvd that I actually enjoy doing and don't feel silly doing. It was challenging but incorporated so many different fun moves with 30 second intervoles that it never got boring, I was always excited to see what would come next! Needless to say, I was definitely sweating after every single workout. The only reason I rated this exercise dvd 4 stars was because I was a little dissapointed in how short the exercise segments were, I thought they should be longer.. at least 10 minutes each.

The 30 second bursts per movement are challenging but do-able and I never feel like I want to give up.  It also helps that Kendra is trying to work off the baby wight, as am I so watching her gives me a ""if- she- can- do- it, I- can- too"" feeling.  I recommend this DVD to anyone, but especially to new moms who have trouble losing those last ten pounds and who can never get away from the baby long enough to get to the gym.",1396310400,,582,4.263636363636364
