8281753,4,B001B3LIOM,"AMERICAN OUTLAWS

Released in 2001, ""American Outlaws"" is yet another rendition of Jesse James, Cole Younger and their Gang. This one focuses on the end of the Civil War and the first few years of the gang's activities,which lasted a whole decade in reality, from 1866-76, ending with the foiled Northfield, Minnesota, bank robbery on September 7, 1876. Jesse & Frank escaped while the others were captured or died. While Frank tried to settle down to a normal life in Virginia Jesse restarted the gang in 1879, but was shot by Robert Ford, one of his trusted gang members on April 3, 1882.

""American Outlaws"" is highlighted by a great cast with palpable chemistry, including Colin Farrell as Jesse, Scott Caan (aka 'Danno') as Cole, the beautiful Ali Larter as Zee, Jesse's girlfriend/wife, and Timothy Dalton as the lead Pinkerton. Gabriel Macht, Will McCormack, Nathaniel Arcand and Gregory Smith are also on hand as notable members of the gang. The film plays it fairly serious accented by a fun, joie de vivre spirit, sorta like Indiana Jones in the wild West. You can tell the cast had a blast during filming. This is the exact opposite of the grim ""The Long Riders"" from 1980, which is arguably the best and most accurate film about the James-Younger Gang.

As far as historical accuracy goes with ""American Outlaws,"" well, there was a group of outlaws in Missouri called the James-Younger Gang and they did rob banks, trains, and stagecoaches in Missouri, Kentucky, Iowa, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas, West Virginia and Minnesota (whereas Jesse's later group continued the gangs' criminal legacy in Alabama, Missouri, Louisiana and Mississippi), other than this the historicity is pretty butchered for the sake of rousing Western entertainment. See ""The Long Riders"" for a more austere and accurate version of the tale.

BOTTOM LINE: Even though ""American Outlaws"" loses points for inaccuracies and implausibilities, it scores high in overall entertainment value. It's a turn-off-your-brain-and-have-a-blast kind of Western. The movie performed poorly at the box office in 2001 and Roger Ebert gave it a scathing review. Ebert compared it to 1972's ""The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid,"" which he praised. This was strange because that film wasn't exactly realistic either; in fact, it's a veritable parody or black comedy. These movies shouldn't be compared in the first place since ""American Outlaws"" details the gang's first year in action and ""The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid"" the gang's final bank robbery, a whole decade later. Furthermore, the two films are expressly opposite in tone: ""American Outlaws"" makes the wild West larger-than-life and ALMOST fun while the other film de-glamorizes it, making it profane, ugly and idiotic. In any event, ""American Outlaws"" is seriously rollicking Western lore worthy of one's video library.

The film was shot in Central-East Texas (great locations, by the way) and runs a short-but-sweet 94 minutes.

YOUNG GUNS II

Released 1990, ""Young Guns II"" details events as told by 90 year-old ""Brushy Bill"" Roberts, who claimed to be Billy the Kid in 1950, shortly before his death. The plot is essentially accurate to history, revolving around Pat Garrett (William Petersen) being hired to track down Billy (Emilio Estevez) and his gang, which includes Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), Doc Scurlock (Keifer Sutherland), ""Arkansas"" Dave Rudabaugh (Christian Slater) and Henry William French (Alan Ruck). James Coburn (who played Pat Garrett in Sam Peckinpah's 1973 film ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"") is on hand as John Chisum while Viggo Mortensen plays one of Garrett's men.

This sequel to 1988's ""Young Guns"" is almost as good and in some ways even better. For instance, the 80's pop rock score of the former is replaced by excellent music from Alan Silvestri, which has some moving parts. Speaking of 80's rock, Jon Bon Jovi has a couple of songs on the end credits (""Blaze of Glory"" and ""Billy Get Your Guns""). Billy the Kid was only 21 when he supposedly died in 1881 and Estevez does a good job of capturing the wild axx punk whereas Chavez and Henry are the most likable characters. On another pictorial front, the Southwest cinematography nicely captures the Old West.

Besides these positives, the highlight for me was Jenny Wright as Jane Greathouse. One of her scenes is topped off by an unexpected ""Whoa Mama"" moment. This is the first and only time I've heard of her or seen her. Her career unfortunately fell apart shortly after this film due to substance abuse, but I hear she's healthy now, albeit no longer interested in acting.

You don't have to view the first movie to enjoy this one; but it wouldn't hurt.

The film runs 104 minutes and was shot in Arizona and New Mexico

8281758,5,B001B3LIOM,"I have many western movies and have even worked on a few myself. This 2 movie set contains two of the best westerns ever made. American Outlaws is absolutely a must own western. Dramatic telling of the Jesse James, Cole Younger Gang. Almost every role is played so well it is wonderful. A note on historical accuracy.....Many highly rated and/or expensive westerns to make were awfully loose with historical fact. This account of Jesse and Frank James and every character is charming and follows the actual events much closer. It accurately sets the main theme for the events following the American Civil War. Folks in Liberty, Missouri were being robbed of their land by railroads, very doubtful dispatch of Union Soldiers, rising of the Pinkertons, etc. The James Gang was locally popular for all the right reasons.
