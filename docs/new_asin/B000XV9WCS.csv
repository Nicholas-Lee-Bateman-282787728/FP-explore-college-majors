8229995,5,B000XV9WCS,"The first season particularly of this series was special and it's a real shame that the series ended so quickly.  If you never saw it, the series was about allowing people who were in a limbo-like state after a death experience go back to a turning point in their lives and allowing them to choose a path that might change their lives.  Sort of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" like.  D. Howard",1369180800,3,385,4.394366197183099
8229996,2,B000XV9WCS,"I bought these DVDs over a year ago, but just recently got around to watching them.  I thought I was getting two seasons worth of one of my favorite shows, but instead only got two episodes per DVD.  Be sure to read the fine print carefully!",1360540800,5,241,4.217391304347826
8229997,5,B000XV9WCS,"It's fantastic, very good! I like it so much! My favourite episode is ""Even Steven""! It's magic to think that there are  second chances in life!",1325116800,,144,4.538461538461538
