It is disturbing,but not in a real heavy way. Pretty much,one of those made for tv style films,but fun in its own manner... Check it out on CHILLER TV and you will see what I mean.

8478217,3,B005LKH6KQ,"I had read about this movie for a while but the only way I could see it was by buying a non-USA version from Australia from Amazon.  I watched this on my PC running Windows 7 and media player without any problems whatsoever (and I did not have to fiddle with region encoding settings).

I guess because I had such difficulty tracking down a copy of this movie, I had set unreasonable high expectations from the actual production.  I would have to classify this as being roughly on par with an extended version of the ""Hitchhiker"" series.  The production values are good enough.  The plot did drag in some places but the ending did have a minor twist.

It is still worth owning but it might be worth waiting for either a used copy or for a less expensive United States region encoded version.",1334620800,4,791,4.458333333333333
8478218,3,B005LKH6KQ,"<strong>Victim</strong> (Matt Eskandari and Michael Antony Pierce, 2010)

<em>Victim</em> was one of the few horror flicks the Capitol Theatre showed during its one-week-only late-night runs in 2011 that I didn't get a chance to go see on the big screen, so I was quite happy to find it wandering in the gutters of Netflix Instant. I'll start by saying I didn't like it nearly as much as I did a number of the films I was able to catch theatrically from that series (<em>Stake Land</em>, <em>Trollhunter</em>, <em>We Are What We Are</em>, etc.), but despite its amateurishness and tendency to over-rely on its twist ending, it's not a bad little movie (and its twist ending makes a helluva lot more sense than does that of <em>The Silent House</em>).

Plot: spoiled rich guy (Stephen Weigand in his first screen appearance) tries to pick up a waitress in a bar while drunk. Upon leaving the establishment, he is jumped and sedated. When he comes to, he is in a cage in the basement of a mansion, looked over by the engimatic Dr. Volk (<em>Very Bad Things</em>' Bob Bancroft) and Volk's silent, sadistic henchman Mr. George (<em>Con Air</em>'s Brendan Kelly). Spoiled rich guy, who remains nameless throughout the film (by design, if you're paying attention), has to figure out what Volk and George want from him, given the small, sometimes changeable collection of objects in his prison cell, as well as find a way to escape before they are able to proceed with their nefarious plan (cue demonic laughter).

And I wish I could tell you what the nefarious plan is, because it's pretty brilliant, and while the road we take to get from ""where the big twist is set up, years before the film takes place"" to the events in the film itself is--to say the least--wildly farfetched, I have to give the directors credit for telling this story in a stylish enough way that what is basically torture porn becomes something with a heart, no matter how black and twisted that heart may be, and a decent amount of humor. I wasn't expecting that, and I won't deny that I felt a few moues of discomfort at the amusement I was getting out of the denouement (I'm pretty sure we were supposed to be amused, but it still struck me as uncomfortably sexist), but it's worth overlooking the microbudget on this one, even if you don't normally indulge in this sort of low-budget foolishness. I mean, it played theatrically in Cleveland, for heaven's sake, how obscure can it really be? ** ",1327449600,,2465,4.738927738927739
