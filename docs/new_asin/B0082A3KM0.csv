8524214,1,B0082A3KM0,Arrived on time but one of the episodes kept skipping. Not happy.,1474761600,,65,4.5
8524215,2,B0082A3KM0,"This soap has what could be a great storyline, but the way it is presented is deplorable.  The actors are not well-suited for their parts and it seems that their acting is forced.  Also there is often a lot of noise in the background, so I found myself having to adjust the sound volume a lot.",1388880000,,293,4.214285714285714
8524216,2,B0082A3KM0,"The characters make no sense, nor do their circumstances, nor do the way they resolve their dilemmas, and it takes much too long to cover any narrative territory. If the woman who had the abortion was so upset about having to take that decision, why did she do it, and what claim does she have on our sympathies given that she lies to her husband regularly? That bad a marriage is a problem rather than a drama, and given how awful the woman is, why doesn't her best friend run off with the husband? The idea that dividing a grammer school into competing groups as a way to improve education is laughable. These students are not interested in learning no matter how much they are begged to do so. Why bother? It might have played better as a farce about trying to improve schools rather than as a soap trying to come to grips with a social problem.",1356480000,5,848,4.3734177215189876
8524217,5,B0082A3KM0,This is one of the best UK dramas on DVD. I got my copy at Barns & Nobles last week. I'm not sure why it's still on Pre-Order on here. But it is a very gripping show. I don't wanna spoil anything for anyone. If you think high school students have drama you have not seen anything yet. The teachers may be worse. I could not stop watching it. Anyone that likes UK shows needs to see this! If you're not sure look it up on wikapedia & it might change your mind!,1344297600,8,459,3.946236559139785
