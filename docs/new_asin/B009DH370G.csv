8540277,5,B009DH370G,Everyone seemed to work collectively to make this movie a success.,1419465600,,66,5.090909090909091
8540278,4,B009DH370G,"The Secret Of Monte Cristo with Rory Calhoun who is always a favorite is a very good movie, and quite interesting to watch",1395964800,,122,4.3478260869565215
8540279,3,B009DH370G,"This is a rather dull and overlong swashbuckler, though Rory Calhoun does a better job than I expected.  He's assisting the daughter of a man who holds part of a map leading to the treasure of Monte Cristo.  They join with the others holding the remaining fragments and set off in search of the loot, encountering treachery and banditry on the road.  Fine for swashbuckler completists, eminently skippable for all others.",1389830400,,421,4.901408450704225
8540280,3,B009DH370G,"Don't let the poster or DVD box fool you. Both show a virile Rory Calhoun, stripped to the waist, wearing tight pants and boots, with a sword raised in phallic fashion. Alas, no such pose occurs in the movie. Rory - pushing 40 at the time of filming - remains fully clothed throughout. In fact he and all the other members of the B-level cast look as if they've just stepped from the dressing room of the Acme Costume Company. Rory plays an ex-British Army captain in the year 1815 who becomes involved in a search for fabled treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. It's the old plot about a treasure map cut into four pieces, each piece now held by a different person. As ""costumers"" go, this kills time pleasantly enough but it's shallow and predictable and Rory Calhoun continually seems to be not only on the wrong continent but in the wrong half-century as well. And then there's the matter of his not taking off his shirt.",1377734400,,928,4.464705882352941
8540281,2,B009DH370G,"i got mistaken by the ""Conde of Monte Cristo"", this one is fair movie at most. the transfer is ok but does not worth the 20 bucks",1372550400,,129,3.814814814814815
8540282,4,B009DH370G,"""Secret of Monte Cristo"" (or ""Treasure of..."" as it was titled in the UK) is no classic of the swashbuckling genre, but it's been a favourite adventure film of mine since childhood. There's plenty of action (enthusiastically of not too competently staged), some gorgeous Italian locations and a pleasant cast giving its all. On the minus side, the print is in very poor condition, badly scratched and faded; it is however presented in its full widescreen ratio, which makes a welcome change after years of pan and scan TV showings. The steep prices on these Warner Archive DVDs might put some people off, but if you're a swashbuckling fan like me, Warner's latest batch of costume pictures is likely to prove to tempting to resist.",1352419200,4,731,4.856
8540283,4,B009DH370G,"Robert Baker and Monty Berman were in the Fifties in direct competition with
Hammer films. With their Tempean Films they, like Hammer produced a series
of low budget B film Noirs usually with American stars in the lead to ensure a
USA release.
Generally the Tempean films were slicker and more well made than the Hammer
entries with THREE STEPS TO THE GALLOWS,THE GILDED CAGE and TIGER BY THE TAIL
being top-notch little thrillers.
When Hammer struck box office gold with their gothic horror films Baker and
Berman followed with films like BLOOD OF THE VAMPIRE,FLESH AND THE FIENDS
and JACK THE RIPPER.They even used Hammer ""regulars"" like Peter Cushing and
Jimmy Sangster.
Baker and Berman then went into the Swashbuckler genre;which Hammer were soon
to follow up with. Hammer even employed Baker and Bermans ""house"" director
underrated genre master John Gilling.
THE SECRET OF MONTE CRISTO is an entertaining romp and looks more expensive
than it probably cost to make with lavish sets and attractive locations.
The cast seem to be having a really good time and its fun to see Western star
Rory Calhoun in a different setting.
While not as good as  Hammer classics like PIRATES OF BLOOD RIVER and
CAPTAIN GLEGG it is certainly a notch or two above later Hammer efforts like
DEVIL SHIP PIRATES and THE SCARLET BLADE.
All in all a fun romp and a must for Rory Calhoun fans.",1349913600,4,1373,4.793248945147679
