3589658,4,B001FZQOPO,"Full of information and well told. Violent times and lives but the film does not descend to graphic violence, which would have been a temptation. Of very high standard as has been all of the Phil Grabsky work that I have seen.. Recommended to all interested in History and the present political scene.",1407110400,2,301,4.69811320754717
3589659,4,B001FZQOPO,"I didn't really like the Constantine episode much; it was rather unfocused and visually flat. However, the Julius Caesar episode was exemplary. Not only are the scholars represented all of the highest caliber, but they are all erudite while also being very down-to-earth. I use these videos in the (college) classroom, and they are good tools for pulling together reading and sparking discussion and questioning.",1403395200,2,412,5.3538461538461535
3589660,4,B001FZQOPO,"While by no means having the ability to be comprehensive in the time-frame covered and some fine details are often missing, the series nevertheless is well-narrated and gives viewers a nice outline of the lives of the Emperors concerned and the issues they faced as part of their rulership.

The episode on Octavian is interesting, one the one hand it avoids ""taking the side"" of the much more romanticised Marc Antony (in many flims etc)and a view often portrayed of him as bad ""Tyrant"" who supplanted a 'democratic' system, and instead they work to illustrate how he was seen by people as the key to stability and the prevention of civil war. On the other hand everything he did is laced with a certain amount of judgement. There is the slight tinge of judgement in the narrative, that all was cynical politicking when there is the genuine prospect he was well considered by the populace given the construction projects and stability he oversaw. Nevertheless the series does well in stating how Augustus ""surpassed"" Julius Caesar. Despite often being seen in his shadow, Augustus nevertheless did a good job in his posturing and manoeuvering.

The episode on Nero has done a good job of trying to emphasise ""what could of been"" in terms of attempts by Seneca et al to give him a principled and well advised upbringing rather than just allow the extent of his later excesses to colour how they portrayed him.

The discussion from nicely engaging Academics to accompany direct quotes of contemporaries (and provide context) is a good mix. Interestingly it errs away from the trend for the character re-enactment style of footage often now seen in many documentaries on the History channel for example. I think the series did well, as while interesting these can sometimes make a series look cheesy and so the series retains a good intellectual edge.

Overall, it is worth considering that the documentary series is really an examination of the various critical turning points in the life of the Empire and the Emperors who presided over them. In terms of the Emperors lives specifically, it is really a discussion of the key political decisions and directions taken, and some of the personal issues and background that influenced these. It is not the type of discussion that gives in-depth discussion or understanding of any crucial battles for example.

If I had to consider anything it is missing, although in its very title the series purposefully is discussing the Caesars, and Marius was not an Emperor as such, I think it would have been nice if the series had broadened its scope and included Marius and the Army reforms he initiated as part of the series, as Marius and his reforms were rather crucial in the development of the Roman civilisation, even if it was during ""Republican"" times.

Overall, this series is nice to have and useful on the DVD rack or on the bookshelf in conjunction with other material and books on the Roman Empire.",1306195200,3,2948,4.850894632206759
3589661,4,B001FZQOPO,"Each of the six documentaries in this set is 47 minutes long. The series has to really simplify these Caesar's histories, but it does tell their stories well. I found the scholarly contributions (comments from  academics) informative. It is also well directed by Phil Grabsky. My only complaint is the lack of informative imagery to accompany the narration. The slow motion close-ups of classical buildings, paintings, sculpture, as well as sand, roads and sky are beautiful to look at, but they don't add anything to what we are being told. And I almost never knew what I was looking at. For example, was that really an ancient portrait bust of the person being discussed, or was that just a generic bust?",1285545600,16,706,4.8347107438016526
3589662,5,B001FZQOPO,"I'm  surprised how few reviews there are of this excellent series. It's a fascinating look at six of Rome's critical politicians and emperors, from Gaius Julius to Justinian, with quotes from contemporary observers and excellent commentary from leading British historians. I checked it out of my local public library. It's a treat for serious students of Rome, young and old, with penetrating insights into human ambition, the drive for power, and the legacy of the ancient world. More cerebral than the usual video fare and probably not for those solely interested in video-game battle simulations or dramatic reenactments of the HistoryChannel variety. These episodes succeed in conveying a sense that, over a period of more than 2,000 years, both how little and how much has changed in the realm of politics and society. This one stands out among a limited number of available, intelligent,documentaries about noted Roman emperors.",1276992000,19,934,5.3108108108108105
3589663,5,B001FZQOPO,I have to disagree with R.A Vlasic.  I was really pleased when I started to view this series [I still have two episodes yet to watch].  My kids have been getting a lot out of it too - they're studying Roman history at college.  I think the series is a way to get a good overview of the Roman Empire through the lives of the 6 most famous Emperors.  The cinematography is stunning; the narration is easy to follow and the opinions of the experts add a human touch making the history really easy to absorb.  Buy it and learn something you didn't know before.,1233792000,26,556,4.257142857142857
3589664,2,B001FZQOPO,"The quality of this video and the efforts made to produce it do not warrant the price of it.  One is used to better historical presentations of ancient Rome from the History channel and other television presentations.  I should have previewed the item before purchasing it, and I would recommend that others do the same.  Save your money.",1229731200,11,338,4.793103448275862

8303205,5,B001FZQOPO,Singles out Julius Caesar as a thug who was a great general but a poor administrator. Yet Nero was misunderstood but great architect!,1473292800,,133,4.826086956521739
8303206,5,B001FZQOPO,"This documentary is very well done. Historically accurate, in line with most history books. A bit repetitious but other than that it was good.",1463875200,,142,4.958333333333333

8303209,3,B001FZQOPO,"To be succinct, My opinion is that it is too loaded with modern takes on ancient behavior. Any time we try to put our rules on historical facts, we tread on a very sharp line. Most of the history of Julius Caesar is only available in his own words (as written by a scribe, no doubt). The rest is only in military texts. Other's views, even if contemporary, must be taken with a dose of salts. We didn't live then; if we did, do we remember it correctly? Was he tough? yes. Did he have to be? well, you gotta better way to do it? We need to give Rome and Romans a break. They did the best  they could, and a lot of their results still stand. What will history say about us, if anything? ... sammy",1442102400,2,695,4.036231884057971
