2274422,5,B0009A40F2,"I was shocked when seeing a release date for the Animated Rambo Series because ir has not been on TV for about 15 years in the USA, and is wanted by fans where ever you read about it online and no one has it completely,only 4 more volumes are needed to complete it, 11 are on this and the other volume due, 65 were made in total, hopefully they will bring another 2 volumes out by Chrismas and another 2 early next year to complete the series

Rambo was based on the successful movie franchise of the same name starring Sylvester Stallone as freedom fighter John Rambo. The cartoon series debuted in April of 1986 as a five part mini series, and was renewed in September as a daily cartoon. Unfortunately the series only last one season and was cancelled in December of the same year(65 episodes were made in total.

In the cartoon, Rambo was now part of a team called The Force of Freedom which went on missions around the world

battling against the evil organization S.A.V.A.G.E., led by General Warhawk. Although the cartoon was filled with lots of fighting and gun fire, there was never any sensational violence, blood or gore, and rarely did anyone ever die. Rambo used violence as a last result and relyed on quick thinking and fast moves to outwit his opponents. It is a very good classic.

2274423,4,B0009A40F2,"well here is a cartoon that is a little too american/patriotic for its own good, but it was a time when we all looked up to heros and love that they could defeat anything and anyone.
i just don't like the order that the episodes play out i mean sometimes there is a character in the series that has been with rambo for example say a whole dvd and suddenly dvd 2 that character presents it self as they have never meet before thats just confusing specially if u are a kid watching this,

but it was probably how it was writen back in the 80s so the are forgiven however i have all dvds of rambo and since the don't playout in the order i want it im not sure what the last episode is plus im pretty sure im missing a couple of episodes and i have duplicate episodes also, so minus for that.

but still since i like this show i recomend to all that are in to action and classic good guys vs bad guys its a must to see",1355788800,,914,3.9619565217391304
2274424,5,B0009A40F2,"This is a great cartoon to have in your collection. Not only is the voice of Rambo by Neil Ross (Lion-o of the Thundercats cartoon series) but it is a great action cartoon. the thing i like most about this series is that when Rambo fires his weapons actual bullets are being fired, not lasers as most other cartoons. The only thing bad about this cartoon release is that the episodes are not in the correct order of television release but if you can get a episode list, you could watch them in the correct order. Other than that, this is a great dvd.",1217030400,,550,4.298076923076923
2274425,5,B0009A40F2,"Although I never watched this series as a child growing up in the 1980's...I have truly enjoyed watching them on DVD!
If you haven't seen them...check it out!",1210723200,2,158,4.678571428571429
2274426,3,B0009A40F2,"My fondest memory of this show was catching it on VHS. My first thought was Ruby-Spears Enterprises trying to one-up Marvel/Sunbow Productions G.I. JOE's audience. The only difference was it had real gunplay, yet no blood. I must admit that RAMBO was not the most obvious choice for a cartoon, but the action was credible. I give it that. Now why couldn't they do this for DOC SAVAGE?",1200787200,,384,4.661764705882353
2274427,5,B0009A40F2,"Its too bad for the region code,but I like the cartoon so much! :)",1171324800,,66,3.7857142857142856
2274428,4,B0009A40F2,these cartoons are the animation is just like most of the other cartoon that came out in the 80s here you get 65 episodes on 6 dvd. one fault the episodes are not in order  if you use the menu right on your dvd there are 11 episodes on each disk,1155427200,,245,3.803921568627451
2274429,4,B0009A40F2,"Rambo and the Force of Freedom fights against the S.A.V.A.G.E. evil forces led by General Warhawk and his hechmen who tries to impose their will and control different countries in the world.

The Pentagon has Colonel Samuel Trautman and the Force of Freedom in charge of dealing with all situations that compromizes the world's peace.

Expert mechanic Turbo,master of disguise Kat and ninja White Dragon helps Rambo on his tasks against Sgt. Havoc and an all sort of villanins and mercenaries.

I used to watch this when I was a kid and I like it. Graphic violence is show but noone is hurt(audiencies are 5 and up).

Overall a great entertainment.",1135814400,2,648,4.8108108108108105
2274430,1,B0009A40F2,"What a Rip Off - Only 2 episodes per disc.

I am not only a big fan of the Rambo animated series, I also had the chasnce to work on it. So, when I found out the episodes were coming out on dvd, I pre-ordered them without researching more info on the discs set for release. The discs list about 11 episodes, but only have 2. I thought this must be a mistake somehow. I then played the disc in a few players and still only episodes appeared.

A friend asked me did I really belive that 11 episodes would be fit on one disc if not double-sided? Which this is not. I have returned both volumes 1 - 2 for refunds. What a Rip Off!",1125619200,2,624,3.9444444444444446
2274431,5,B0009A40F2,"Man, it's awesome to finally get back to the action with RAMBO and the Force of Freedom after all these years!  Kudos to Lion's Gate for bringing this underrated Ruby-Spears classic to DVD.  Don't be misled by the cartoonish cover art; this is the original, violent-but-bloodless animated series you remember from 1986.  For proof of this, look no further than the screenshots on the back of the case -- one of which shows our intrepid hero wrapped in heavy chains and being attacked by voracious rats!  Inside said case you'll find a single disc packed with a whopping 11 episodes of gun-blazing, knife-wielding, flame-throwing fun!  (Note: The episode selection screen displays only two episodes at a time; you have to hit the arrow in the lower right-hand corner to see more.)  Oddly, the shows are in a completely random order...a veritable grab bag of Ramboness, if you will.  Based on a guide I found on the Internet, the episodes on this disc are numbers 43; 3; 18; 15; 29; 14; 59; 13; 34; 7; and 11.  Strange; but random Rambos are better than no Rambos, right?  With so much great content for such a great price, it's not surprising that the video is a little grainy and the audio is sometimes a bit muffled (even though the case says they're ""digitally mastered"")...but grainy Rambos are better than no Rambos, right?  So lace up your army boots, sheathe your bowie knife, tie a red bandana `round your forehead and join John Rambo, Colonel Trautman, KAT and Turbo in their never-ending battle with the diabolical General Warhawk and his minions: Sgt. Havoc; Gripper; Nomad; Dr. Hyde; Black Dragon; Mad Dog (a.k.a ""Spike"") and Jerkface (yes, Jerkface).  ""Get me Rambo,"" you say?  Well, you've got him!",1124150400,10,1711,4.802047781569966
2274432,5,B0009A40F2,"I never thought I would see this cartoon again! RAMBO was one of my favorite cartoons growing up, I used to watch it all the time! I was shocked to see it was being released. I just picked up the 2 volumes at WAL-MART today!! Having Wal-mart selling it is real good it will get alot of exposure they had it in the first cabinet with there new DVD releases!! Talking about making a come back!! If you have never seen this cartoon I highly recommend it! A classic from the 80's! I hope Lions Gate releases the rest of the series I feel that if these sell good they will so tell your friends RAMBO IS BACK!!!!",1118793600,5,606,4.1440677966101696
8058769,5,B0009A40F2,"Hilarious. Two things make this great. One is that Rambo will be sitting in an office but still can't wear a shirt, but the best is his fact of the episode. Like Venice is known for their glassworks.",1469404800,,199,4.2631578947368425
