Many scenes with cool street performers and cute animals in almost every shot keep it interesting and fun. It teaches good values like forgiveness without being preachy. It is low budget but they clearly spent money on good writers and the actors are believable. I'm surprised a big studio hasn't picked this up. I really enjoyed this and highly recommend it.",1479600000,,497,4.472527472527473
