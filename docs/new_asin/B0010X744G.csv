3053686,5,B0010X744G,"This tv mini series is really fun. You go on a trip with DG as she meets and befriends the people of the O Z while trying to reain her memories, save her family and thwart her evil sister. I like how Cain was characterized as a TinMan (Police for the mystic man). The characters are likeable and believable, and the scenery and costumes were amazing. Well scripted and well acted out.",1482883200,,384,4.347222222222222

3053696,5,B0010X744G,"This is a unique twist on the Wizard of Oz only that Zooey Deschanels  acting is only ok. All the other actors, actresses did an amazing job. I would recommend it. Very sci-fi, did not expect that.",1474070400,,197,4.324324324324325

Oh and no cussing!",1472428800,,162,3.7941176470588234
3053699,5,B0010X744G,One of SyFy's best movies.  A nice take on the Wizard of Oz for adults.,1470009600,,71,3.7333333333333334
3053700,5,B0010X744G,I love this remake of the Wizard of Oz,1467936000,,38,3.3333333333333335
3053701,1,B0010X744G,"Other than guessing who's who -- oh, there are the flying monkeys, oh, that guy must be the cowardly lion, are the parents Uncle Henry and Auntie Em? -- this series is a whole lot of boredom.  DG -- Dorothy Gale, what a no-brainer there.  Alan Cummings is very entertaining as the Scarecrow, the rest of the cast is just meh.,  This is the hugest snoozefest from a long line of insomnia breakers out of the hands of master rip-off artist Nick Willing.  How the hell he managed to get Richard Dreyfus sucked into this sack of crap is a true mystery, and  Dreyfus gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm not really enchanted by Nick Willing's appropriation of other people's ideas.  Geeze, at least Gregory Maguire was original enough to get a Broadway musical out of his borrowed material.",1467676800,,829,4.5608108108108105
3053702,4,B0010X744G,Good movie,1466812800,,10,4.5
3053703,4,B0010X744G,"Is it a classic like the 1938 film? No, it has some issues. But it is well worth the purchase of the DVD set. The effects are only so-so considering the level they are at in 2007. More SyFy channel than major motion picture quality, but I don't think that detracts a great deal from the story. They aren't horrible, just could have been better.

But the story itself is very good. It may be a bit contrived to make some of the plot elements work but I'm fine with that. The characters reimagined is what I like. DG (Dorothy) is not a clueless teenager who flounders around in the story seemingly overwhelmed. The tin man used to be lawman (Tin badge, get it?), the lion is actually another species with telepathic powers and the scarecrow was a brilliant adviser to the queen but had half of his brain removed by the evil ruler. Much more believable to me than a group of anthropomorphized beings.

Like I said, I can't see this one becoming an icon of cinematography to last for decades. It drew me into the story enough that I watched all 4 1/2 hours in one sitting just because I couldn't leave it hanging at the end of each episode. And it was worth it to lose a little sleep to see it. I doubt I'll marathon watch it again, but I certainly will watch it again. I have no problem recommending this mini-series to my friends who like the sci-fi/fantasy genre.",1464048000,3,1362,4.358267716535433
3053704,5,B0010X744G,This is one of my favorites and the discs were of high quality.,1461801600,,63,3.923076923076923
3053705,5,B0010X744G,"An amazing family movie that gives plenty to talk about.

Pros: good direction
Great actors
Solid script

Cons: slow in places
A bit long

However my review is based on watchinb this as a movie, not a mini series, which it is.",1461196800,,226,4.333333333333333
3053706,4,B0010X744G,Very interesting dark re-imagining.,1460851200,,35,8.0
3053707,2,B0010X744G,"I wanted so much to like this miniseries. I glimpsed it on SciFi once and it looked like a good time, but minus a few good ideas--a Tin Man being a police officer, the Scarecrow literally being a man without a brain--it is just slow and plodding. The effects and sets are good, and it's obvious the creators meant well. Alan Cumming and Neal McDonough try their damnedest to salvage it but Zooey Deschanel spends the whole thing staring confusedly around and speaking in a vague monotone. If she had one believable expression in the whole thing, it might just be endearing, but as it is, she's Alice wandering vapidly around Wonderland with none of the original's charm. The plot approaches interesting a few times as it meanders along, only to take a hard left into cliche and predictable. It's just a waste of talent. I can't recommend it at all unless you really love the original story...and even then, you'll be disappointed.",1460160000,,930,4.711656441717792

3053716,5,B0010X744G,"Tin Man is by far the best re-imagining of the Wizard of Oz
(Except Return to Oz) which is very underrated

If you are a fan of the original this is a must see
Because it's so cleaver to tell the story in such a fresh new way
***** Star cast,

Great Visual effects,
Some of the best color's in a made for tv mini-series! The production values are on par with big budget Hollywood films

3053723,5,B0010X744G,"A real extravaganza ,Zoeey makes a real quirky Dorothy. I have read the entire series of books and I think this remains true to the series if you postulate a few simple rules of magic.

3053726,5,B0010X744G,"When L. Frank Baum wrote The Wizard of Oz he intended to write an American Fairy Tale without any danger or nightmares. Thank heavens that the eleven collaborators on the classic movie ignored that whole thing. Though the movie is still under copyright Baum's Oz is in the public domain. This wicked variation on a theme is clever, quirky, and a lot of fun. Not perfect, but a bold attempt that was worth watching again.",1440806400,,420,4.613333333333333

The cars looked like they were from the 1930s and the military vehicles looked like they were from World War II they were. I have seen other movie do similar things.

3053840,4,B0010X744G,Another really good TV to DVD movie. The story line is a refreshing take on The Land of Oz. The only downside is that there are a few parts of the movie where it is dry.,1398124800,,169,3.7222222222222223
3053841,4,B0010X744G,"I suspect this came from the same team that created the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice/dp/B0031DDG9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice</a>&nbsp;mini-series. It has all the same characteristics I liked so much in that one. It honors the original without trying to redefine the characters, or wedge new story into the old plots, or capitalize on the name to suck viewers into an unrelated plot. Instead, it follows a parallel path, brushing closely at times, adamantly its own creature while maintaining respect for the beloved stories and movie that begot it.

Taken by itself, it's a more-than-passable modern kind of fantasy - gritty, noir at times, boiling with unresolved tensions and unexplored strengths that give plenty of room for each character to expand. Visuals are strong, even if they tend to rely on icons more than new imagery, but that's a fair way to get time-bounded story telling up and running. And, there's plenty here to echo today's headlines: harsh interrogation, deep-cover agents, S/M overtones in the Evil Sorceress and her corsetry. But, when you line it up against the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/classic-rendering/dp/B00CNW9ZI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">classic rendering</a>, that's where it really stands out. Old and new at the same time - riffing on the old as a jazz guitarist might, but respecting it.

3053867,5,B0010X744G,I have watched Tin Man 4 times in the last 3 months. It is an excellent production based on The Wizard Of Oz. There is also a bit of Indiana Jones as well. The cast is excellent and features Zooey Deschanel in the starring role. I will definitely add this movie to my collection.,1394323200,,279,4.185185185185185

3053869,5,B0010X744G,"I love Tin Man.  I watch it over and over -- and it never disappoints.  It's my favorite retelling of the Wizard of Oz story.  This Blu-ray 2 Disc Set has the complete set of extra interviews with the cast as well as a mini-doc about the making of The Mystic Man's cabaret act.  (I particularly enjoyed the interview with Raoul Trujillo who played Raw, the visionary who sees with his heart.)

For fans of the 1939 film Wizard of Oz, there are ""easter eggs"" imbedded throughout Tin Man -- some obvious and some very subtle.  Just spell Ahamo backwards. I dare you. Grin. Sure, Tin Man has flying monkeys -- but they're really scary and fly out of tattoos that adorn the evil witch Azkadellia's cleavage. We're talking scary *cool.*  The scarecrow character, Glitch, is brought to life by Alan Cumming -- whose head sports a snazzy zipper.  The cowardly lion, is the aforementioned Raw,a gentle seer. Toto is there, too, but he's played by the incomparable Blu Mankuma, familiar to sci-fi fans from the New Outer Limits.  But Tin Man is truly carried by Zooey Deschanel as DG and Neal McDonough as Wyatt Cain the Tin Man of the title. DG is a strong female lead that I'd feel comfortable being a role model; and the Tin Man himself is a Good Man.

This OZ -- the outer zone -- is peopled with munchkins, robot nurture units, and a Kind Queen, held prisoner by her daughter. And because it was filmed in beautiful British Columbia, the world of the O Z is truly lovely.  Combine the old and new, and you have this lovely fantasy for the ages. All this and Blu, too!

I cannot give this edition of Tin Man enough stars.  It's delightful.  It's haunting.  And it's one of my favorite miniseries ever.  Get Tin Man and know the wonder of the O Z.  In its own way Tin Man is a classic -- every bit as much as 1939's Wizard of Oz. Enjoy!",1393372800,,1830,4.366863905325443

3053871,5,B0010X744G,Sy-Fy certainly did a beautiful job re-imagining the Wizard of Oz with this one.  I won't give away too much so that you can enjoy this if you haven't seen it.  But for example tornadoes are like transporters between Earth and Oz and the tin man is a law enforcer.  The whole thing plays out very much like the original Oz.,1392336000,,323,4.262295081967213

3053906,2,B0010X744G,"Wow this is truly awful. Zooey Deschanel has all the acting range and emotional authority of a sponge. She reacts to being thrown into a unique fantasy world as though she'd seen it all before and it wasn't as good as last years Burning Man. The writing is almost as bad, trite and lame being two words that spring instantly to mind. However the art direction isn't bad, and its relative competance saves the series from being the one star bomb it actually is.

3053927,4,B0010X744G,"To reiterate, the verbal part of the soundtrack contains no subtitles and is difficult to manage for the hearing impaired.  One hears enough to enjoy it  but not enough to follow many parts in detail.
One need fear little or no interference with gratification from the potential memory clash with the classic musical based on the same original. There is no singing to Arlen and Harburg tunes, and no attempt to duplicate the unique qualities of Bert Lahr, Ray Bolger and Jack Haley, much less, Margaret Hamilton (the wicked witch) or Billie Burke (The Good Witch).
Standing on its own, this is an entertaining version of the Frank Baum original, with a less distinguished cast than assayed the parts in the late thirties, but with a different set of expectations (straight acting) than pertained in the earlier work. The cast does a good job in a situation where overacting is invited by the situations played. No doubt to subdue the almost inevitable (with the older audience) temptation to recall the earlier musical score, this one has a strong musical background, often emphasized in scenes.
Unless divided into its component three parts by the listener, there is a tendency toward tedium. More than 90 minutes at a time is a bit overlong. Stick to the episode lengths and I think you will find it more enjoyable.
There is an adequate display of  visual phenomena but not up to the level, BIG pictures today accomplish with the computer based imagery. All in all, I think this will prove good family watching in most homes.",1380672000,4,1527,4.820610687022901
3053928,5,B0010X744G,"In my opinion this is one of the best if not the best TV sci-fi fantasy films of all time.  Superb cast, excel. special effects and very
provocative story lines; in my opinion one of the most imaginative ones.  Terrific casting of Zooey Deschanel  as ""DG"" and a fine supporting  cast
though I wonder if the producers tried to get Zooeys older sister Emily to play her ""evil"" sister.  Perhaps she was tied up with  BONES productions
which started around the same time this film was being made.  I was absolutely enchanted by Zooey who I never heard of before this film.  I generally
do not like actors-actresses very much and have little respect Hollywood (or weird) though I do occasionally take in a movie now and then.  I love
good fantasy and sci fi movies and this one fills the  bill. It was Zooey in this film that eventually led me down the road to BONES TV program which
I fell in love with.  And Emily along with Zooey I think are amoung the two most beautiful women I have ever scene: perfect in every way from glorious blue eyes to brunette hair ( do not like blonds!).  I am still enchanted with them though FOX seems to be paring down the partnership with
Booth a bit, something I do not like.  And I would like to see Zooey make a few more cameo appearances with her sister, playing her sec. cousin.  They both can act as well as sing beautifully.
  But more on the TIN MAN.  I just love the way throughout the film there are subtle and sometimes not subtle references to the great MGM move THE
WIZARD OF OZ, now of course is owned by WARNER BROS.  Some parts of the O.Z. (OUTER ZONE) are not very nice (sort of like New Jersey) and Central
City, the Emerald City of the O.Z., is becoming more like Detroit under the tyranny of the beautiful but nasty Sorceress who also is the sister of
DG.  The TIN MAN gets his name from being a policeman at one time before he gets locked up in a kind of old fashioned diving suit like device.  This tale is a long one, about 4&1/2 hours without commercials but is very enjoyable.  I did not see it on TV until I watched it on my DVD set (I bought
from AMAZON of course!).  I have watched the replays later on TV.  I don't wish to say more for those who might read my little lines of whit, and
have not seen the film, but if you like fun, heroism, feisty (and beautiful) Zooey, good special effects and a happy ending then this is for you.
This is really not a childrens movie but there really isn't anything in it that is offensive either.  Good clean fun!!

3053946,4,B0010X744G,"OK first and foremost the movie is a very good CONTINUATION of the original Wizard of Oz movie. For those of you who have not read the book it is nothing like the movie except the main characters, Dorthy and the Witch.
  Now the main point. THIS IS NOT A REMAKE, UPDATED VERSION or RETELLING of the original story! This movie takes place many many years after the original series (L Frank Baum wrote several). Oz has grown up (as all civilizations do) and it's leadership has failed and it is now under the rule of a new ""bad witch"". Zooey's character is not Dorthy Gail but a descendant and she has no idea of anything Oz related. Yes she is named DG, Oz is called the O.Z. and several other characters are redefined. It is modern and updated.
I cannot understand everyone making comparisons between the ""old and new versions"". Even the Editorial Review gets it wrong!
Please watch this movie on it's own merits and forget the '39 movie. Much like the new movie ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" it is a standalone story that expands the universe of Oz.",1372636800,2,1048,4.453125

The main charactor, DG, you eventually find out, is decendent of the original Dorothy. This is the only spoiler I've give.

If you liked the original ""Wizard of Oz"", you'll like ""Tin Man"". Tin Man is not a musical.

Tin Man starts out a little slow but quickly picks up speed as you become enthralled in the mysteries surrounding our characters. I gave it four stars because I really don't feel that Zooey Deschanel gave the best performance...she came off very fake in her acting. But the other actors and story made up for her lack of acting and by the end of the series I found it easy to overlook it.

If you enjoy the land of OZ, you'll enjoy this story.",1366243200,2,648,4.015503875968992
3053988,5,B0010X744G,"I'll start with the fact that this movie was originally a SciFI Channel movie. Best actors:  Alan Cumming for Glitch, Neal McDonough as the titular Tin Man, and the remarkable ""evil"" Azkadelia played by Kathleen Robertson. This is a darker, more believable, and more adult tale of OZ.

While I absolutely love the story telling expertise in this film and most of the acting abilities of the actors in the movie,I will have to say that the actress playing Dorothy Gale was out of her element in this one. The acting was wooden (though she loosened up toward the end) and you can see the rest of the actors attempting to help and support her. However, I would have to say it is the director's fault that the Dorothy ended up stilted rather than tough.

That being said,The acting only detracted a little from the story. It is a tale of struggle between good versus evil. Dorothy starts off as a teen in the corn belt of America, attempting to liven up her dull existence while also trying to figure out the rest of her life.

Suddenly, everything she thought she knew about her ""parents"" and herself gets turned upside down when a twister arrives bearing unwanted guests. Assassins bent on killing Dorothy invade their home. In an attempt to save Dorothy she is shoved into the tornado.

Of course the result is she is dumped into the land of OZ. Here is where the acting becomes somewhat wooden. Perhaps she was trying to portray shock and dismay.

Dorothy ends up captured my ""munchkin"" types who put her in a cage dangled high in the trees where they are hiding from the Witch's men. She meet the Glitch who literally had part of his brain removed by the witch and a zipper placed in his head. Every so often his mind glitches while trying to remember some thing important that is in the other part of his brain, thus the nickname. Later it turns out he was the court adviser to the Queen and a very gifted inventor. Neal McDonough does a great job with this (he  has had other really great roles after this one, like that of Loki in the last Avengers creation) and is quite believable.

They escape when the witch's men  invade the little gathering and they take off down the road and come across the ""Tin Man"". He is locked in a tin suit (similar to an old fashioned diving suit with the big helmet) and forced to watch the execution of his wife by the witch's men over and over. Dorothy finds out that he was a policeman for the Queen in the Emerald city and was called Tin Man for the badge he wore. The actor does a great, believable job being the tough silent type and eventually warms up to the other characters.

Toto turns out to me a shapeshifter who used to teach Dorothy and her sister Azkadelia (who is actually the witch causing the havoc in the kingdom) magic and he shape shifts into a scottie terrier.  His loyalty is suspect during most of the movie and adds much suspense.

Well, I don't want to spoil everything for you as there are many more surprises in store for the watcher and much more to the story. Suffice it to say that my grandchildren will see this in a few more years, but it is definitely going into my favorites.",1366070400,,3147,4.416234887737478

This isn't the Oz you remember.  This is ""the O.Z."", or ""Outer Zone"".  Beautiful landscapes, elaborate costumes, and great make-up work.  Excellent casting choices, a wonderful score, and special effects that make you say ""wait, this is the SyFy Channel?"".

This isn't for the younger kids.  I would recommend this for hardy 10-12 year olds, or anyone over 13 who is okay with scary parts.  The wicked witch is still very, very wicked (and manipulative).  She just got uglier!  The flying monkeys are uglier.  A new creature is introduced called the ""Pa'pae"" (I know I'm not spelling that right), that aren't exactly pretty.

3054034,4,B0010X744G,"Several years ago, the SyFy channel decided to take a crack at re-inventing the classic Wizard of Oz, a noble task, that many have tried and failed. I didn't know what to expect, but I assumed it would be some variation of the classic tale, hoping it would be more the like books and less like the films. Tin Man is defiantly not for kids and takes a unique approach to the classic story. In this version, OZ is not the friendly loveable place with strange characters and happy times for all. It's a dark story, about a dark place, where presently there is a lot of pain and misery. The big twist in the story is that this OZ is centuries past the one visited by Dorothy Gale. In the Outer Zone (O.Z.), Dorothy Gale is a revered as the start of the royal families bloodline, but she has been dead for centuries! That being said, quite ingeniously, the future residents of the O.Z. parallel the old story, but not because they have to, they are in a sense mocking the original story in subtle ways. There's D.G. (Zooey Deschanel), the girl from the other side, who was forced into the O.Z., with no memory of ever having been there before. She soon meets Glitch, (Alan Cummings) a man who had part of his brain removed for disobeying the Queen. As they try to figure out what is happening around them, they run into a man (Neal McDonough) being punished in a Tin Man suit. This man was a Cop or Tin Man in the O.Z. who was deemed a threat, and put into this horrible form of torture. Finally, they come to the rescue of a native healer, named Raw (Raoul Trujillo), who has become trapped by carnivores and is about to become dinner. Together they go to see the wise man, to find out how to proceed in helping D.G. The Wise Man (Richard Dreyfuss) turns out to be a drugged out magician doing parlor tricks! There are a million other parallels to the original story that make the journey through the O.Z. that much more enjoyable. Zooey Deschanel is the star and even though people often mistake her unique style of acting for inexperience, she was the perfect choice to play D.G. The other standout is veteran character actor, Neal McDonough, who gives a gut wrenching and strong performance as the tortured former cop, in search of his family. The rest of the supporting cast was equally as impressive, taking you through the full range of emotions. As I said before, this is certainly not the OZ you grew up with and it's certainly not what I expected. Everything from the special effects, to the story, and even the modernization, was extremely impressive. It really is a shame that this was only a three part mini-series, but this would have made for one hell of a regular series. Some of the parallels are obvious, but there were plenty of times where I legitimately forgot that I was watching The Wizard of Oz. Leave the musical for the kid, this is what Frank Baum had in mind when he started this series, and it's most defiantly meant for mature audiences only.",1361491200,3,2967,4.455882352941177

3054082,1,B0010X744G,"I can't believe I watched the whole thing!

I should have turned this off after D.G. arrives in O.Z. and meets a zipperhead, a person who has had their brains removed, and yet still is able to walk and talk and interact with people.  By the end of the mini-series, I was convinced the scriptwriter was a zipperhead.

Aside from the zipperhead character, which should be more than enough to tell you the kind of thinking that went into writing this alternate universe story, there was the oddest collection of primitive technology, steampunk technology, superscience and magic all mixed together in a random fashion.

People drove cars that looked like they were new during the 1930s and the military drove what looked World War II military vehicles.  The military reminded me of World War II German soldiers.

There were iron maiden style suits you could lock people in for years that provided all the nourishment that anyone would need to survive.  I wasn't sure if that was supposed to be science or magic.  The one person we meet who has been imprisoned for years (very long hair and beard) is able to walk out without the expected atrophied muscles I would have expected under the circumstances.

There were holographic projectors that displayed images in broad daylight that were real enough to confuse onlookers into thinking they were the real thing.  Was this science or magic?

There were robots that were so lifelike that D.G. never knew that her (foster) parents were actually robots.  Nobody living in contemporary Earth knew they were robots either.  Pretty impressive technology.  Although when the robot parents returned to their hometown, they were met with a very steampunk cyborg.

An evil witch, who manages to be imprisoned without a body for 500 years is helped by D.G. to escape her prison and take of the body of her older sister, Azkadellia.  Shortly thereafter Azkadellia kills D.G.  Their mom brings D.G. back to life but loses all her magical ability in the process.  All her magic has been transferred into D.G.

Then there is the evil witch sister, Azkadellia.  She is able to teleport, keeps flying monkeys stored on her chest as tattoos and sucks souls out of people that displease her.  When she is not using a teleporting spell to visit her imprisoned mom, she uses horses rather than cars for transportation.  Did I mention yet that they have the ability to move between (teleport?) Earth and O.Z.?

The evil witch has built a machine, that wouldn't be out of place in a World War II epic, which is supposed to be the power plant for some kind of laser to be used to end the world.

Whenever the evil people use their streampunk technology (mind control devices, prison doors, brain in a jar computer with the adding machine interface) the controls never look like they could possibly be functional.

Are you with me so far?

There are plenty of other examples of why having a brain makes this a difficult mini-series to watch.  Instead I will go to the stake in the heart of this story.  The moment when I had to ask myself, how could I have wasted that much time watching this came near the end when D.G. talks Azkadellia into fighting the influence of the 500 year old witch that inhabits her body.  This is the 500 year old witch who has killed D.G. once already, the 500 year old witch who eats the souls of people that bother her, the 500 year old witch who enslaved the whole land, the 500 year old witch who personally killed or ordered killed many people, the 500 year old witch who imprisoned many people (a massive prison is featured in a couple of scenes), the 500 year old witch who enlisted an army to do her evil bidding, the 500 year old witch who had enslaved Azkadellia for years, after all that, all it took for Azkadellia, to fight off the evil witch was D.G. saying please fight.  Even better, when did this fight happen?  Not when the evil witch is tired or recovering from exerting herself.  No, this takes place with the evil witch at the height of her powers after she managed to gain possession of the all powerful green gem.

I'm sorry, but as bad and as dumb as the mini-series was up to this point, the ending is so over the top bad and so unbelievable that I had to write this negative review.",1344988800,8,4257,4.603448275862069

The poor director thinks it's a deep, pyschological story but it is just bizarre, infantile and unoriginal with nearly each frame trying to be more hyperbolic than the previous. Before purchase an indication of level of mentality of this film would have been honest.

Devices? Using ""double-location"",why does the wicked sister translocate to the mother on the island but then spend just-behind pony chases through the forest? There is Aristotelian transmigratiom man/dog/ dog/ man/ dog and Hansel and Gretel magic buttons to mark the trail. A ""Round the World in 80 Days"" balloon; ""Star Wars"" redwoods and Ewoks (with painted faces and feathers) and  tree walks; a hat and coat from Ark Raiders and jumping into the gorge from Butch Cassidy and his sun dancing friend, ""beam me up"" to the moon ""Scotty"" - and so on.

The totally wooden, unimaginative ""action doll"" Dorothy (poor, actual actress Garland supposedly inspiring this!) can suddenly use her face muscles in the last scene. Was botox used along with the drops to over-bulge her ""expressive"" eyes. At least the out-of-focus camera work early in the film  -to be ""spooky""? was abandoned for clear, good light filming in the 3rd series.

3054089,5,B0010X744G,"This was a fantastic film, with enough affectionate references to the ""original"" Wizard of Oz that it bordered on being homage, but far darker and edgier than the 1939 classic ever dreamed of being. The visual effects are wonderful, as are the characterizations and most of the acting (sorry, but I just didn't care for Deschanel, who displayed two facial expressions throughout the whole thing). The rest of the movie made up for her, though, and was a thoroughly enjoyable romp down the yellow brick road.

There was a element of sadness for me, though. I suppose I'm nostalgic for what I remember as a brighter, more cheerful past. In today's world, anything as light-hearted, sweet, and joyful as the original (flying monkeys notwithstanding) wouldn't have a chance. Like the residents of OZ, it's as if we're living in a post apocalyptic world, full of fears and hate and dangers. That there is hope at the end of the road (the yellow brick one, of course) is my only consolation. I just wish today's young people could be treated to films that aren't always dark and edgy.

Do not expect a remake, or even a modernisation of the classic. Tin Man is inspired by the Wizard of Oz but is virtually a brand new story with just enough referances to pay homage to the original, this though is not a bad thing. this is a very original story with some very intriguing plots and twists.
Zooey Deschanel is brilliant as D.G an outsider to the Outer Zone but clearly on a path of destiny, a path that reminds her of forgotten memorys. Zooey does well carrying the story and the other charactors, her big blue eyes and her on screen presence is the glue that holds the story together
This is a Sci fi channel original and is very much belongs in the sci fi genre, but also has elements of Lord of the Rings.
This is a story of adventure, friendship, good, evil, and a story of sisters and family.

3054122,4,B0010X744G,"Sadly, the german DVD is edited down to just 86 minutes so I ordered this Blu-Ray and hey... its a very interesting Version and return to Oz.

Not only Neal McDonough (""Desperate Housewives""), Zooey Deschanel, Kathleen Robertson (Claire in ""Beverly Hills 90210"") and Alan Cumming and Richard Dreyfuss are interesting actors, also Ted Whittall (""Smallville"" as Rick Flag)as Ahamo (return spelled Omaha), Dan Payne (also once guest in ""Smallville"") who play the longcoat leader , Craig Veroni (""Stargate Atlantis"" in Season 1) have a nice appearances.

Those longcoats troups remember me somehow to Gestappo in the WW2. Hm.. for some fetish fans could be any scenes interesting (Leather/Rubber Uniforms/Clothes).

Very nice are the trivias / references to the original 1939 THE WIZARD OF OZ Movie:

The Housenumber where D.G. (for Dorothy Gale) is living has the number 39. It can been seen in a scene before the storm is beginning. Its a reference to the year of 1939.

During the dream sequence, DG is asked if she's been having dreams again, and she says, ""Yeah, in Technicolor."" ""TEchnicolor"" was the camera process who gave the 1939 movie the wonderful color.

The officer who's giving D.G. on the beginning of the movie a ticket for her driving has the name Gulch. A reference to Miss Gulch.

Near on the beginning of part 2, DG calls her father ""Popsicle"". In the ""Wicked"" stage version its also mentioned but by Glinda the Good Witch.

My mind: the Mini-Serie is very nice and interesting. The special effects are sometime not quite perfect and looks cheap (any creatures!). Others looks very good.

The picture quality is good. The soundtrack is english and contains english subtitles (which I need sometime as help).

Also very nice - the bonus-features have a lenght of approx. 155 minutes and are interesting (Interviews, behind-the-scenes documentaries).

FAZIT: Of course, its quite different from the 1939 movie which was very magic and beautiful. No other new movie/remake will get his ""magic"". Don't try to compare it. Zooey Deschanel is not Judy Garland, Neal McDonough is not THE Tin Man like Ray Bolger it was. Also Richard Dreyfuss is not Frank Morgan was as the Wizard etc.

3054123,2,B0010X744G,"I WANTED this to be good - the concept is great; a gritty, violent, dark retelling of the Wizard of Oz. The budget was not small - the CGI effects are better than most TV series (way better than Primeval, maybe on par or slightly better than Supernatural) and the sets, costumes, and a few moderate to big name actors (Richard Dryfus), the camera work is great and has some cool, interesting, and at times unconventional cinematography. The GLARING flaw is the poorly written dialog and whoever directed the actors didn't have a clue what he wanted - nor a very good eye for yelling ""cut"" when a line isn't delivered and everyone stands around for a few seconds in uncomfortable silence while the actor is reminded of the line (which audio guys took out in post).

More than anything, I'm baffled as to why the lead playing DG (Zooey Deschanel) - the Dorothy equivalent - would be cast in ANYTHING but bit parts. Shes HORRIBLE!!! No emotion in her face or voice, she slurs lines, says words wrong, shes stiff and robotic, and in general - at this moment in her career anyhow  - she has no right to be called ""actress"" - she doesn't act. I think 100% of those uncomfortable silences were brought waiting for her to say a line. How did Zooey get past the demo reel review stage? Shes cute - she looks the part - and that's where it ends. She must have known somebody important or had some serious clout with the director to be kept on here. No director handed a budget this big would keep someone as incapable as this on as lead for more than a week of rehearsals. I'm sure this hurt his career something fierce. UNLESS - Zooey was directed to be like this - in which case the director should be or should have been blacklisted. Any way you cut it, its tremendously jarring and sad. Kathleen Robertson was also lacking, but not as significantly. Surprisingly, Alan Cummings - normally a fun and natural actor - delivered his lines with a sense of ease but feels totally out of place and lacking rhythm with his lines. His role comes across like hes not sure what to do half the time. Maybe the director is to blame for all this - i dunno. I just wanted it to be so much better.

I guess this had so much promise that I'm downright angry at it being ruined by a crap director or a few apathetic actors/actresses cast in the headlining roles -  whichever is the case. I know I'm being harsh, but I'm also being honest. The director may be to blame - but its clear Zooey want ready for this role no matter how you look at it. Its like shes super stoned in every scene, and looks lost amongst a sea of capable actors. My opinion anyhow.

Not everyone is a train wreck though - props to the saving grace talents; Callum Keith Rennie (always a pleasure to watch), Richard Dreyfuss of course, Neal McDonough (always stable, consistent - a solid actor, especially in hard-edged roles like this). Two stars for everything done right - no love on the other two and a half stars due to the brick wall of awfulness that won't let me see past the lead characters to enjoy the rest. Yes shes that bad. I would've given this 4 1/2 stars if I couldn't believed in her character for even half the time - she didn't sell it and didn't even seem to try.",1325808000,3,3232,4.353233830845771

3054130,4,B0010X744G,"Critics have written about how this production is kind of a mess, and they're right.  The story is languid far too often, it feels like it could have lost an hour at least, there are all kinds of characters introduced and never seen or referenced again, they travel to all kinds of places they don't really need to, it's obvious how much the production is trying to mimic Lord of the Rings, Zooey Deschanel is great to look at on screen but much of the time it feels like she's playing herself rather than a character (or that she's high).  And after all of that, it has this incredibly abrupt and (for me, anyway) unsatisfying ending.

That said, I still enjoyed watching this.  Some critics have written that the multiple references to the Baum original or the movie were too obvious or corny, but I enjoyed catching all the references amid the sometimes very dark story.  I also liked the steampunk aesthetic.  And most of the people involved make a valiant effort: the special effects are fine for TV; the sets and costumes all look great; the little girls do a fine acting job in the flashbacks (sometimes I felt like I'd rather watch a whole show about them); Dreyfuss is obviously slumming (he must have needed some quick cash) but is enjoyable to watch, even just for the ""what is he doing in this?"" factor; Cumming is not great but perfectly fine, though I never quite got what his character was about; Kathleen Robertson as the villain seems to be enjoying herself the most out of the main cast (apart from Dreyfuss), though what the intention of her character's final plan was remains a mystery to me (it seemed like she already ruled over everything, so why did she need to make the O.Z. dark - just for the metaphorical value?); Callum Keith Rennie is great as Zero, and shows some real terror in his 'torture' scene, though his character is a fairly one-dimensional bad guy.

Just like Lord of the Rings, I found the first installment to be the strongest.  The ending is certainly worthwhile just to see the resolution of the story, but like most stories, the part where everything is set up and the characters and their ultimate purposes are introduced tends to be the most interesting.  There seems to be a very good balance between realism and adventurism in the first part that is lost in the second two.  When they jump off the cliff, it's a great moment that reminds you you're watching a fantasy adventure.  By the time the story gets to electrocution and torture and characters weeping over graves, it's good dramatic stuff but the balance between the serious and the fantastical that I thought really made the first part just vaporizes.

I personally thought the ending was too abrupt, and I would have liked even just one shot of the future of the O.Z. with D.G. and her sister in their rightful places and with Ambrose advising and the Tin Man doing whatever he would do and so on.  Just a ten-second shot right before the closing credits would have been sufficient.  Maybe someone thought that a sequel was possible so they ended it like that, but there was a lot of material they could have lost to make room for a little glimpse into the O.Z.'s future.

When Deschanel's character finally figures out who she is and remembers all the history she's a part of and what really happened to her sister, it's a very good dramatic moment which reveals a depth to the script that almost makes up for all the flaws in the production.  There are a few moments like that where this story succeeds, so keep them in mind when you're sitting through the parts that don't.",1323302400,2,3585,4.578125

That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but as it stands I cannot recommend it. The story is predictable and poorly written. The director doesn't utilize the strengths of the actors, who have the potential to be good. Overacting seems to be encouraged. Some acting is better than others, but subtlety is totally nonexistent in any of the characters. Was this written for children? Not sure who the audience is supposed to be, but sure wasn't written for me.

The production design was pretty good. The makeup was horrid. Being a fan of the LF Baum books, I wish that someone would do a series that was as scary and dark as the original books.

3054142,2,B0010X744G,"So, I clicked this show because I'd seen SyFy's ""Alice"" - which I really liked by the way - but this is no ""Alice"".  It has promise, some of the characters are endearing - ok, maybe only Glitch - the idea tries to be fresh, some of the adaptations are fun and clever, and the special effects aren't bad considering it's age.  However, the acting can be painful, the plot is very slow and confusing, and the music and sound effects are often louder than the dialog and not what I would term great.

DG (Dorothy) is...not great...she runs oddly, has a tendency to seem rather whiny, and her motivations seem lacking.  The Tin Man was a great idea, but his acting isn't great and he seems rather stereotyped.  Raw bears little or no resemblance to the Cowardly Lion and his character is very undeveloped.  Glitch - the Scarecrow - is probably the best, his acting is good and he's funny.

However, the characters weren't my biggest complaint - don't get me wrong, I have complaints, but they weren't the worst part. The worst part is not even the poor acting, but rather the fact that this could've been great, but it just ended up forgettable. Many of the adaptations of characters and ideas from ""The Wizard of Oz"" were good, but so often they just ended up weird or confusing or incomplete.  The first episode was the best (but it did drag quite a lot) after that I just felt like I needed to finish the series for the sake of finishing it.

This is absolutely a dvd collection to add to your shelves. I remembered it vividly from its original broadcasting on the SciFi network and it still remains just as awesome. The characters are lovable, plausible and the kind of people you are inclined to care about greatly despite all of them being strangers. You get surprises and twists, you'll even have laughable moments. At the end, maybe you'll feel as I do and wish that the Scifi network would hit the magic note with other fairytales and childhood stories. Neal McDonough is perfectly cast as the jaded ex cop with a heart of gold. Same with Raoul Trujillo as Raw, you just feel the characters and in doing so, you connect with them. Anna Galvin I found particularly vulnerable yet touching in her role.",1319760000,,895,4.670886075949367

This isn't the most original story - it can't be, right?  It's based on The Wizard of Oz.  However, the integrating of new ideas with references to the original story makes it something quite enjoyable.

Sci-Fi/Sy-Fy is really good at making cheesy movies, and this isn't the cheesiest.  It's easy to take the campy references to Oz (calling it the O.Z.), or D.G. the main character (Dorothy Gale), but as a whole, it's worth taking the time to watch.  The creativity in weaving the different character stories together was done well, even though there is a lack of continuity in the story - it's forgivable.

As for all ages, I don't think so. First of all a few bad word were used during the movie, some parents will not like it and last but not least, some may find the fantasy a little dark for children.

They put together an interesting tale/vision, which struggled with my love of the original film throughout, which I think is at the core of just enjoying this unique view. Just remember, we aren't in Kansas anymore, and I think you'll be engrossed in this series, perhaps best saved for rainy days due to its length.

There are no Subtitiles on the 2 disk SE DVD release. None.

That means all of us hard-of hearing folks can't watch this even after buying or renting it. Epic Fail folks. That leaves millions of people out in the cold.

Since the DVD reviews are linked under the BluRay release as well that came out in 2010, I am still trying to find info on that release. Amazon doesn't list subtitles on the bluray product description, but a few other sites do on the BluRay. Anyone know if this is true?

Netflix recently uploaded a version with subtitles to instant watch, so I finally was able to watch this for the first time in 2011, 4 years after it came out.

Some of the special effects could have been a little bit better - like the Papae (sp?).  They looked completely computer generated.  There was not enough depth to them.  I enjoyed each character, but the actress who played the evil sister, Azkadelia had such a wide range of emotions displayed across her face in a matter of seconds that I stand in awe of her acting ability.

3054181,4,B0010X744G,"Fan's of the books be warned. Nothing in this mini-series follows the book. In that sense it is truly ""inspired by"", and not a screen adaptation of existing work.

As to the actual movie itself.  It has interesting characters who grow and develop over time The outdoor sets that are amazing, and the indoor sets that are quite impressive. It is a made for TV series and some of the green-screen and CGI work is glaringly obvious, but it's the story is strong enough to cary over those moments.

Now about the cast. Most of the time they range from solid to excellent. But DG and Azkadellia have a similar approach to life. I can actually see this from two points of view.
First  I don't know if the producers were trying to hit the ""strong silent type"", or if someone took to much prozac, but in some very high stress situations they respond with a attitude that channels every 13 year old eye rolling ""yeah, What-ever!"". It does not mater that certain death is in front of them, or they just suffered a major emotional trauma, they become stoic.
Second, it may actually make sense. At one point DG says: ""Well, I guess this is not a dream."" and that makes a lot of sense. If you where asleep one minute, and the next you where running from nazi SS troops in leather coats, and hanging in a bird cage while tiny little blue and red painted elf warriors discussed torturing you while a dude with a zipper in his head watches you from the ceiling I think a certain amount of detached ""wow, no more chili fries before bed"" attitude is appropriate. I mean who believes something like that could actually happen? And with all that hits DG over the course of 6 days about her parents, her extended family, and her life who can blame her for becoming a bit blase about new emotional drama.

Overall, a good series that kept me engaged, and which I felt was a fun look at the story of OZ from a different viewpoint. Worth watching, but definitely not a program for children.",1298678400,,1966,4.419889502762431

Set several generations after the original OZ tale, this is the story of Dorothy Gale's great granddaughter who has to fight against her possessed sister to save OZ. For those who are fans of the original story, look for details cleverly interwoven into or scattered throughout the story that echo the original tale in some way. There are many and each time I watch it, I catch more. Brilliantly done.  The Tin Man was played very powerfully by Neal McDonough - he almost steals the show, for those with a heart. Zooey Claire Deschanel is just wonderful as DG; while her acting is considered deadpan by some, her face is so expressive - I know people in real life just like DG's character. Kathleen Robertson is delicious as the evil Azkadellia. In fact, most of the actors are well suited for their characters. For me, the only exception is the guy who plays DG's real dad. He was OK, and may be a fine actor, I just didn't think he was best person for this particular role. But the rest - great.

3054203,4,B0010X744G,"...it's hard to put my finger on what exactly is missing in the chemistry of this series, but perhaps it lies in the inability of the director to decide who the main audience is.

In any case, I'm glad that I saw this re-telling of Baum's ""The Wizard of Oz.""  Tin Man's OZ is not the largely sweetness and light Oz of the 1929 version's fame.  This Oz is ""The O.Z"" (O.Z. = ""outer zone"").  This is the O.Z. of a cruel princess/witch who wishes to plunge the O.Z. into perpetual darkness and rule with an iron fist forever.

D.G. is a post-HS aged young-woman who lives on a sleepy farm somewhere in the midwest.  She has recurring dreams about a far away place, and she renders those dreams into drawings and paintings. She works as a waitress in a dreary diner, and knows that she was meant for something more.  That something more, at least in her mind, never included the Outer Zone...which of course, she enters.

The acting is strong at times, weak at others, but entertaining throughout.

I enjoyed the different slant that the writers took in this post-Wizard of Oz and emerald city view of the Outer Zone.  There are Gestapo-like ""long-coats"", evil scientists in the employ of the princess, an Outer Zone resistance movement, and D.G. gets dumped into the middle of this.

All in all a good made-for-TV mini-series hosted by the Sci-Fi Network.  I liked the cast, the story's premis, and what the director did with it, for the most part.

For example, I really loved the new take on the Tin Man.  He was a real man, not some empty tin suit... who had actually been trapped in some kind of metal man shaped torture chamber.  Inside this metal suit he was forced to re-live the most horrible moment of his life over and over and over again for years... until DG saves him.  On the other hand... I did not like the new modern interpretation of the scarecrow.  I felt that Glitch's character... was really just kinda stupid.  With a zipper down the center of his head to show he was missing half his brain, and how he keeps forgetting things...  I though this character could have been developed better.

3054221,3,B0010X744G,"I agree with the other reviewer who said this falls short of the original intent to make this an adult version of the classic children's movie. The acting is sub-par all the way through, except maybe Richard Dreifuss' Mystic, and the comical Glitch. The others are carboard characters with no complexity at all. The production is surprizingly good for a TV series, but the attempt to fuse the different genres is pretty cheesy. We have heroic quest fantasy a la Lord Of The Rings, a fairy tale (Alice in Wonderland), distopian science fiction story (Brave New World), post-apocalyptic action-adventure (Waterworld, Mad Max). Many scenes and characters are out of place, like the entire ""Resistance"" army. They cannot resist anything at all - the witch and her army are too powerful. The witch's army and Gestapo-like secret police is pretty redundant as well - isn't a witch supposed to have magic to do all that for her? The WW2 machines especially seemed ridiculous. Also the whole Dune scene in front of the Witches Castle (which itself is like the Dark Tower in Two Towers) seemed highly unoriginal.

That said, I still like the way the plot gradually unfolds to reveal more about the heroine and the villain, and the way they are intimately connected. And there are some interesting scenes involving magic, such as the demon-like dark witch possessing Askadelia, and her eventual exorcism at the end.

On the whole this is a highly derrivative, un-original work, albeit a very entertaining one.",1280448000,4,1499,4.968127490039841
3054222,4,B0010X744G,"""Tin Man"", a 3 part mini-series that aired on the Sci-Fi channel in 2007, is a re-imagining of the Wizard of Oz.  But unlike the classic 1939 movie, which despite its overtones of evil, was basically a bright and cheerful place, ""Tin Man"" is much darker and apocalyptic (and in a sense, truer to the novel by L. Frank Baum.)

The story follows D.G., a young woman in Kansas who lives at home on a farm, working as a waitress in a local diner, and yearning for a more exciting life, one where she better fits in.  Without giving anything away, she is transported to the O.Z. (the Outer Zone) and meets up with updated versions of the tin man, cowardly lion, and scarecrow, who help her on her quests.  However, while giving the occasional nod to the 1939 film, the story and characters in ""Tin Man"" are basically brand new, and are entertaining and imaginative.

For a miniseries, the special effects are quite good and very realistic.  The actors are, by and large, talented and fit well into their characters, especially Alan Cumming as Glitch (the scarecrow), and Neal McDonough as the Tin Man.  I had some problems with Zooey Deschanel's portrayal of DG, though.  While Ms Deschanel is extremely talented, I felt that the scope of her character's emotions was too limited and too bland, when greater passion and amazement would have been more appropriate.

While I enjoyed the story as a whole, I also thought some of the dialog was a bit too stilted and/or trite at times, and that there were several holes in the plot that could have been better explained.  Again, without trying to give anything away, the evil witch has her purpose, but it's never really clear why she wants to do it, especially as the likely impact would be the end of the world.  The first two episodes were better in this regard, while the third (and final episode) felt a bit rushed.  I also would have liked a slightly longer and more conclusive ending after DG and company defeat the witch.

Taken as a whole, though, this is a good miniseries.  It runs to about 4  hours of actual viewing time, and is well worth watching.  I liked how they turned the story of the Wizard of Oz inside out, along with the superior productions values, and how well the actors fit their roles.",1280361600,4,2255,4.558312655086849
3054223,5,B0010X744G,"WE ALL KNOW the Tin Man is the guy looking for a heart. But in the three-part series broadcast on SyFy (formerly SciFi), we have ""...a team of characters missing parts who, as a group, complete each other,"" as Raoul Trujillo (Raw/Cowardly Lion) says in the making-of.

Sounds a lot like the original, yes? Still, the overriding quest in this new take - from the Wicked Witch, Azkadellia (Kathleen Robertson) to D.G./Dorothy Gale (Zooey Deschanel) herself - the theme is finding heart as in love and courage.

In a clever script from Steven Long Mitchell and Craig W. Van Sickle directed by Nick Willing, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" both book and film, have been filtered through a rusty steam punk lens for an exciting sci-fi twist. Gadgets made up of ancient office machines and what looks like Dr. Frankenstein's original set define the O.Z. or Outer Zone. The Scarecrow is now Glitch (Alan Cumming), once the most intelligent man in the universe, now a zipper-headed goofball in search of his missing brain. (Find it bottled in Dr. Frank's lab in  the W.W.'s industrialized castle.)

D.G. - Dorothy - wears bootcut jeans and rides a motorcycle in old Kansas where she works as a waitress in a blue gingham apron. (Who wouldn't want leave that behind?) ToTo is a shape shifter. The Cowardly Lion - or Raw - has leonine characteristics and is a member of an empathic race, captured and used by the W.W. in order to glean secrets from her enemies.

The Tin Man/Wyatt Cain (Neal McDonough) is an Old West style law enforcer complete with cool hat and six gun. He also rides a white horse. When introduced, Cain is found in a gruesome metal diving suit contraption, a device that continually replays the most horrific day of sustaining him physically. His heart is hardened by grief while the others are shattered, yet they band together to fight the evil that has overtaken the O.Z.

That would be the gorgeous Wicked Witch who dresses in extreme, body sculpting style - golden body armour, leather, satin  - and whose flying bat monkeys come to life through tattoos inscribed on her cleavage.

Visually, ""Tin Man"" is a treat with all its imaginative characters, costumes and sets. Effects are not always the best. Those flying monkeys, for example, are sometimes painfully rendered. Some efforts, such as the green house and double eclipse, look amateurish. However, it all blends in well with the story; color and detail are movie quality, especially in high-def. A stereo soundtrack sounds good; viewers will enjoy re-watching and listening for classic Oz references. An original score by Simon Boswell has a lush, almost classic sound.

Extras are carried over from the DVD collector's edition and make lively viewing once the series concludes. The best would be ""Beyond the Yellow Brick Road: The Making of Tin Man,"" a detailed behind-scenes exploration with interviews from cast and crew. This is a film adults can enjoy on their own or together with young ones. It might even make a decent, two-night double feature with the classic ""Wizard of Oz"" - or pair it with Nick Willing's most recent SyFy homage, ""Alice,"" a reboot of ""Alice in Wonderland.""",1279843200,2,3147,4.845437616387337

3054230,4,B0010X744G,"Tin Man is a miniseries that was shown on the Sci-Fi channel and which came out in December of 2007. It stars Zooey Deschanel (as D.G.), Neal McDonough (as Cain, the Tin Man), Alan Cumming (as Glitch, the Scarecrow) and Raoul Trujillo (as Raw, the Lion).  It is based upon the Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum but adds a lot of fantasy and science fiction and takes many, many liberties.  The characters are based on Wizard of Oz characters and the land is the O.Z. (Outer Zone).

At the beginning of the series, we meet DG, a teenage waitress in Kansas that is tiring of her life there, feels that there is something that makes her different from the people that she works and lives with (even though she can't put her finger on exactly what) and is haunted by dreams of a woman with lavender eyes telling her that a storm is brewing. And a storm does come - Azkadellia (played by Kathleen Robertson), aka the Wicked Witch - sends a troop of her long coat policemen to kidnap DG and bring her back to the O.Z. DG escapes by jumping into the travel storm that brought the longcoats to Kansas and meets, in short order, Wyatt Cain, Glitch and Raw in the O.Z. The troop learns that Azkadellia is searching for an emerald with which to permanently cause the O.Z. to become dark and that D.G. inherited that knowledge when DG's mother revived her after Azkadellia killed DG using dark magic. Therefore, DG is the key to Azkadellia's success. The group then begins a search to find the Mystic Man (played by Richard Dreyfuss) in the hopes of stopping Azkadellia from ruining the Outer Zone.

I had high hopes for this movie/mini-series. The concept was very promising - an updated, edgier version of the saccharine movie and children's book that we all know. And in some ways it delivered, but in some ways it did not.  I really liked Zooey Deschanel - she totally redefined Dorothy and was just fun.  McDonough was appropriately cast as the Tin Man, as was Alan Cumming as the Scarecrow. I didn't like the Tin Man though at all, the character was just too two dimensional. He was driven too much by cynicism. The story was an interesting re-telling of the previous version and I thought it was pretty creative.",1272844800,2,2203,4.508771929824562

3054246,5,B0010X744G,"Most everyone has seen the ""Wizard of Oz"" with Judy Garland, and perhaps even ""Wiz"" with Michael Jackson. But nothing compares to the version called TIN MAN, which is THE STORY OF OZ, that the ORIGINAL author had written years ago. Walt Disney made it a ""family classic"" for all to enjoy as a family. Even the Wiz was created to show off all of Michael's well known capabilities with similarities that followed the ""Wizard of Oz"" to some degree.

But the Tin Man fantasy series is completely mind blowing, and I almost missed seeing it when Sci-Fi channel offered it, not knowing that it would take me into the original author's incredible mind. He created a story with all the elements of fear, love, humor, hate and finally reconciliation. IT IS the Wizard of Oz as it should be read or seen. It's worth it many times over. What a treat of creative fantasy from years ago! And the actors sealed the deal for me as well.  Even my creative daughter in Portland raved about it.

The wizard, the evil witch, Toto, and most of the names you undoubtedly expect when watching an OZ movie show up - but in much different ways than what you would expect. Tin Man is the story of DG and her quest to save her mother and stop the evil witch.

Tin Man takes the Wizard of OZ and re-imagines it without concern for the original film and by freeing themselves of the baggage the writers took this story in fantastical directions. Tin Man is a fun ride through familiar yet completely new lands.

3054271,4,B0010X744G,"When I first saw the commercials for this show on television, I thought that it was a re-do of the old classic The Wizard of Oz. First that thought most be expelled if you are under the same impression. This show is not a re-do even though the main character goes by the name D.G. (which I assumed was Dorothy Gale) and there are characters who are obviously supposed to parallel the original characters. But never fear the show does address the parallel between the two, with an ah-hah moment near the end.

I never liked the original Wizard of Oz and the first time I watched this I watched with trepidation, however I was pleasantly surprised to like this version. One thing to keep in mind is that this show is very long, but put into several part for the ease of showing on television. I find that this can be either helpful or annoying depending on how you deal with sitting and watching a show for long periods of time. The first two parts are on the first DVD and the rest is on the second along with bonus features. I consider this one of the downsides, because who wants to change DVDs in the middle of a show. It is slightly reminiscent of long movies on VHS that had intermissions so you could change the tape.

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this show and DVD set. And am glad that it came out on DVD. Just remember before purchase that this is not the original!",1263600000,6,1373,4.33852140077821
3054272,2,B0010X744G,"This is a rather pointless, but not altogether unwatchable, rendition of what you may have enjoyed as a child. Frankly, I'm still not too old for witches and munchkins, even at the age of 50-something. It's just that sci-fi has been added when it really didn't need to be.

The two sisters Dee-Gee (for Dorothy Gale) and Azkadellia, both are attractive antagonists, but the problem with the entire plot is that the wicked Azkadellia's chief goal throughout this entire story is to just blow up the Outer Zone (OZ). That's it, nothing more, except that she has many, many people with homes and families who are assisting her in this.

My thought was: Why????

It would be one thing is she wanted the same old power and gain routine that bad people want, but no, she wants to vaporize the entire zone. And it doesn't make sense. And if this is so science fiction, why do we need witches, anyway? Sci-Fi should not interject itself into fantasy and vice versa. Yet here were have technical wonders being admired by a magic-casting sorceress. And why would her evil minions support her in the destruction of OZ? What do THEY get out of it?

3054277,2,B0010X744G,"I really wanted to like this series.  I love the cast, and I love both the books and movie of The Wizard of Oz.  But Tin Man was a disappointment in almost every respect.  The acting, even by those who've been good in other movies, was spotty.  No one except Richard Dreyfuss turned in a solid performance throughout.  The story was a taped-together hash of Star Wars, Dark City, Star Trek, and a dozen better shows.  Even the theme music (repeated endlessly and overbearingly) sounded like Harry Potter.

The whole thing seemed listless.  The actors didn't seem to be putting much into it, the pace was slow and uneven, and most of the design & art direction was uninspired.  It's completely mediocre, and riding on the coattails of Oz seemed like an act of desperation.  It did not earn its link to the Oz books/movies in any way.  The connection was arbitrary and pointless, though the only modicum of fun was spotting the old familiar faces (Oh!  There's Toto!  Hey, there's the wizard!).  But it seemed unsure what connection, if any, existed in its universe between events in The Wizard of Oz and events in Tin Man.  Most of the time the links were random, and when it did try to make a real connection it didn't make much sense.  On its own merits, as a fantasy adventure, it has nothing interesting to say or show.  Casting itself in the tradition of Oz doesn't help much.  There are some good laughs, and the evil witch is inspired and frightening, but otherwise this is a slow and unmemorable series.",1259366400,6,1510,4.57089552238806
3054278,2,B0010X744G,"It was just awful.

A lot of potential in the premise (or rather multiple premises), but ruined by piss-poor direction -- that's the only explanation for the fact that EVERY actor in this woebegotten teleplay seemed to be reading their lines under the influence of a narcotic.  Or under the influence of formaldehyde.

And the lines they should've been putting some, er, acting, into were also dreadful -- some good ideas here (actually, too many... it would take an encyclopedia to map out the stolen ""homages"" to various genres) but terrible, terrible writing.

For a low budget, though, the sets, special effects imagery and photography were quite good.

Too bad overall.... I really wanted to like this one.

It's marvelous!  Amazingly innovative storyline, full of surprises and some serious twists on the original story, but which does not ignore the most important elements of the original cast and story line of Oz.  Dorothy Gale, the original Dorothy character, even puts in a ""black-and-white"" cameo appearance toward the end of the film, handing off her legacy to the ""new"" Dorothy - now known as DG.

The plot line keeps you guessing from start to finish!  The Wicked Witch of the West appears to be absolutely gorgeous until the 3rd hour of the film, the Wizard of Oz, played by Richard Dreyfus, is still a hero, but it's DG's father who helps DG most to save the world, and saving the world of the ""Outer Zone"" - (OZ) is what this tale is all about.  The Tin Man is an amazing hero as well, as is the scarecrow.  There is nothing juvenile about this tale of magic, bravery, the building of trust between friends and the recognition of true heroism.  There's plenty of humor, surprises and action in this story, and I found it thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.

3054284,5,B0010X744G,"I just finished watching Tin Man and I am left with total amazement!

I honestly thought that this made for TV mini series movie would be decent, and I can tell you I am truly wrong. It was not decent, but truly superb all the way around.

I thought that the alteration of an original script icon being that of the historic Wizard of Oz, would make for an interesting film, but unable to  captivate the viewer as a result of too much interfering with the original theme. Again, I was wrong. I am in shock and awe for how good this film is. I honestly believe it is the best TV mini series I have ever seen. My past favorite was Stephen King's Storm of the Century, but this tops that for sure.

If you have the films, The Princess Bride, The Goonies, Indiana Jones, The Neverending Story, Robin Hood, The Watcher in the Woods, and any other great classics that I have forgotten, and enjoyed those, than this is nothing short of those classics!  This film incorporates themes from all of the movies listed above.

While the duration of this film is nearly 4.5 hours you will realize throughout the film that the development of the plot really grows on you. This is why I had to watch this movie in one sitting. I honestly don't like movies that are more than 2-2.5 hours long. I remember sitting in the theater for Gangs of NY and I wanted to leave after the 2 hour mark.  With The Tin Man, I couldn't believe that 3hrs past and I was sad that there was only 90 minutes left!

This movie is a true masterpiece for how technology can be a great asset to incorporate many genres of an adventure/fantasy/sci-fi movie into one film without taking away from the great script and storytelling that goes on.  You will feel emotion for these characters and think about your own family and the ties that you have.  This theme makes the movie suitable for the entire family, whether you're a 32 year old adult as myself, or an 8 year old boy or girl.

It is important to realize that this is a new version of the Wizard of OZ. There will never be another original, but there is no reason why this film, Tin Man, cannot become a classic. If you are expecting a remake or close theme to the original I guarantee after 45mins you will have forgotten about those expectations.

I remember hearing about mixed reviews of the Return to OZ, 1985, and I personally have not viewed it because it got a lot of bad reviews probably because it tried to follow to the original story line too much. Well folk, Tin Man doesn't do that! It is a modern version of how power, technology, and society in the hands of evil can be developed.

If the original Wizard of OZ wasn't so powerful of a tale there is no way such a movie like, The Tin Man, could ever be produced.

The acting and cast were great all around in this film. I am so happy to have found this movie and I am quite surprised I never heard of it. The only reason I did is because I was searching for info on the new 70th Anniversary Edition of the original Wizard of OZ that is coming out on Blu-Ray at the end of September of 2009.

There you have it folks. I think I gave a decent review for how great this film is without discussing the plot in great detail.

3054304,4,B0010X744G,"""Tin Man"" is an interesting specimen of a mini-series. Based on the ""Wizard of Oz"" books by L. Frank Baum, I was initially under the impression that this was either a contemporary version of the 1939 movie or a revisionist treatment of the original children's book. Then once the film started, I realized that it was a complete re-imagining of the subject matter, in which familiar aspects of the book and movie had been redesigned in a sort of ""alternative Oz"", now called the O.Z. (short for Outer Zone). Then, in the third installment of the film, ""Tin Man"" changes again, and is revealed to be a sequel, with direct mention - and even a cameo appearance - by Dorothy Gale herself. As such, ""Tin Man"" defies any attempts to classify it. But that is only fitting considering the source material, which been involved in a range of retellings over the years, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-Wizard-of-Oz-100th-Anniversary-Edition-Books-of-Wonder/dp/0060293233/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 100th Anniversary Edition (Books of Wonder)</a>, to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wizard-of-Oz/dp/B00000JS62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wizard of Oz</a>, to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-to-Oz/dp/B0000DZ3EN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return to Oz</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-The-Life-and-Times-of-the-Wicked-Witch-of-the-West-Harper-Fiction/dp/0061350966/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (Harper Fiction)</a>&nbsp;to the stage-show spectacular. I also recall watching an animated cartoon on Saturday mornings based on Oz.

As such, I'm hesitant to give away too much of the plot for ""Tin Man"". Coming into this movie completely cold as to what to expect, half the fun was watching it all unexpectedly unfold. Basically, a young woman called DG is swept away (literally) from her life as a small-town waitress and into a world with which she feels a strange affinity.

Picking up her own versions of the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion, DG begins to traverse this strange new world on a variety of quests - for her parents, for answers, for the wizard, for memories, for her captive friends, for emeralds, for the struggle against evil...for a lot of things actually. As it turns out, the O.Z. is under the ever-growing control of the evil sorceress Azkadelia (give a girl a name like that, and how do you expect her to turn out?) who has the usual plans to take over the world with the help of a doomsday machine that only needs one last McGuffin to activate its power.

If you're sensing a healthy amount of snark in these opening paragraphs, that's because the first half-hour or so of this sprawling mini-series is difficult to warm up to. DG wears a blue-and-white gingham waitress uniform and stands momentarily in a beam of sunlight (cue eye roll). The first inhabitants of the O.Z. she meets are midgets dressed as...turkeys? I guess they were this version's idea of the Munchkins, but as members of a secret resistance hiding out in the forest, I'm not sure why they decided to dress themselves up in feathers and colourful war-paint.

Azkadelia is every clichd villain you've ever seen rolled into one. She stomps around in a dominatrix outfit, cursing and pouting, and doing things like killing inept henchmen and telling the next in line that: ""you've just been promoted."" Even worse, there are tattoos on her cleavage that turn into this adaptation's version of the winged-monkeys...in order to release them she sheds her outer-garment and thrusts her breasts toward the camera.

I was about to switch it off, but then all of a sudden...it got better! Most of the interest of the story is contained within the twists and turns concerning DG's discovery of the world and its connection with her own past, ultimately making this a story about a long-separated family trying to reunite. There's more to Azkadelia than some gold latex and an evil hairdo, as we find in her tragic back-story that gives her evil acts a purpose. And our three companions: Glitch, Cain and Raw, as the respective Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion, each get their own sub-plots that work well in the context of the over-arching tale. Furthermore, it's fun to see the creators playing around with the source material, such as a new rendering of the Yellow Brick Road, the reinterpretation of the Wizard as a ""Mystic Man"" who is perpetually high on vapours, or the literal use of a ""tin man"" in corporeal punishment, all providing echoes of the familiar story.

This is particularly true when you realize that this is the Oz of the future, taking place many years after the events that we know of in Baum's original story. What with its vaguely steam-punk, retro, mechanical atmosphere, it's easy to believe that this is an Oz that has evolved from our original understanding of that world, with the same blend of Old World resonance and newfangled technology that was present in the book. Sadly, they skipped the opportunity to add in a few details of Baum's book that have not yet made it to the screen, such as the talking field mice or the city of china people...but hey, you can't have it all.

Acting is also a mixed bag. As the protagonist, Zooey Deschanel relies on a droll, cynical tone which mostly works in her favour, but sometimes comes off a little strange. In a critical moment when her life as she knows it is turned completely on its head, she responds with sarcasm and exasperation. It rings rather false. However, her casual demeanor does serve to ground the film, and really - who could resist those big blue eyes? Neal McDonough gets the most attention as the titular Tin Man of the title, and plays his part well, but the real stand-out is Alan Cummings as Glitch, who manages to be both comedic and poignant in his portrayal of a man who has lost the greater part of himself and mournful of his awareness of this loss. There's a reason why Dorothy told the Scarecrow she'd miss him most of all, and Cummings reminds us why.

However, some of the acting, particularly among the supporting characters, is sub-par. I won't name names; suffice to say, you'll know it (and wince at it) when you see it. It's always frustrating when an expensive and generally well-made production is bought down by a lack of talent in its cast. Likewise, some of the special effects are very good, usually the rendering of the scenery and the cyclone, whereas others are awful - the CGI feeders for example.

As many have already noted, this is not for kids, as there are several sexual situations, violent scenes and coarse language. There's nothing inherently wrong with having such things when the need arises, but in this case there's little reason for it except in the attempt to darken things up. Parents would be reluctant to share this with their kids, and that's a shame considering some of the trite dialogue seems as though it was specifically written for children. It's like they're not quite sure who their audience is.

And of course, what would an adaptation like this be without an array of in-jokes, references and winks to the audience? As such, prepare for police-officers called ""Gulch"" and kids who remind each other to watch out for lions, tigers and bears *oh my!* When DG is asked: ""Had that nightmare again?"" She replies: ""In Technicolour,"" and variations of things like ""Have a heart,"" ""I've lost my marbles"" and ""Show some back-bone,"" are oft-repeated (guess what characters they refer to. Go on, guess). And that's just off the top of my head. As with everything else, some work, some don't.

On the whole, I enjoyed myself. Though it's very long, the story moves at a brisk state, and the production design is beautiful - definitely eye-candy as far as I'm concerned. I'd recommend it, just so long as you know what you're getting into before you start watching: as ""Tin Man"" is almost certainly not what you'd expect!",1236384000,3,8133,5.1771863117870724
3054305,5,B0010X744G,"Special effects are a little corny, but other than that, it's a great mini-series.  You fall right back into the old story you remember, and enjoy the new characters and interesting story.  Definitely worth watching.",1234656000,,216,5.142857142857143
3054306,4,B0010X744G,"For many people, THE WIZARD OF OZ is one of their favorite films of all time.  Frank L. Baum's original story became a hugely popular and critical success not long after it was published and the story of the THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ and over 100 years later is still popular and hugely influential (look at the massive success of the musical WICKED). Despite this, nowadays many people have never read the original story or books that Baum wrote.  If they had they would begin to see that Oz isn't necessarily the bright and always cheerful place that the 1939 pictured.  Oz was a fantastical place, but like in all fairy tales, evil and darkness is lurking in the shadows.  Just take the flying monkeys.  Many people think that monkeys are cute and sometimes they are.  But monkeys are also very cruel creatures that like to play with their own feces and can be quite vicious and the idea of monkeys that can fly and are large enough to lift a lion is very frightening.  There's all kinds of creatures like that in Oz, proving that beneath the glitter Oz can be a very scary place, indeed, and a modern update of the tale would make for a spectacular movie.

Thus, the Sci-Fi Channel stepped in and updated the story with the airing of TIN MAN in December 2007.  TIN MAN follows a young woman named DG (Zooey Deschanel).  DG is living in rural Kansas.  She works as a waitress at the local diner in town, rides a motorcycle, keeps getting chased around by Police Officer Gulch, and dreams of moving to a different place and living a more exciting life.  DG is a fantastic artist and great mechanic. She also starts having bad dreams that start to occur more and more frequently.  Late one night DG is awaken by a giant tornado, with a group of armed men in long coats, headed towards the family farmhouse.  Before she can really understand what is happening DG is being chased by the men in long coats and is pushed by her parents into the twister and taken to a completely different world, the O.Z. She undergoes a series of adventures and is joined in her quest to find her parents by a man who has had his brain taken out and has a zipper on his skull, a man who was locked in an iron suit for over a decade who used to be a police officer or ""Tin Man"", and a humanoid lion who has the gifts of healing and telepathy.

I saw the advertisements for TIN MAN when it first aired, but was unable to watch the special. It's a shame because the mini-series became the single highest television event for the Sci-Fi Channel in their history.  After a former student recommend that I watch the series, I made sure to watch it when it aired again in March 2008 and later watched the DVD.  The overarching story is familiar, but the O.Z. is a much different and darker place than the Oz that people are probably familiar.  I found the story fascinating.  The film features a great cast of highly talented actors which gives the production a slightly higher level of creditability than many other Sci-Fi specials.  The special effects are spectacular and the score is riveting.

With that said, there are a few weaknesses in the script. For instance, the timeframe that the story takes place incredible if not impossible and the whole idea of the flying monkeys being magical tattoos that fly off the wicked witch's chest is more than a bit unsettling.  I also was disappointed by the third part of the series.  The first two parts of the series were well plotted, but the third section is rushed and concludes rather abruptly.  The story would have been better if the final act was extended and more evenly paced with a satisfying epilogue.

Still the TIN MAN is a great film. It updates the story of THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ without minimizing it and in fact extends the legend of Oz.  Also, unlike many others who have seen the film I think TIN MAN is perfectly suitable for most viewers, including children.  TIN MAN is a fairy tale.  Fairy tales are supposed to have an element of darkness and suspense in them because fairy tales are really about life and sad, dark, and scary things exist in life.  Besides, flying monkeys really don't exist and if they did we should all be scared of them anyway.

Recommended for people who enjoy films with a good story, people who enjoy quality fantasy films, and people who have actually read some of the original Oz books,

The DVD includes several extras including the making-of featurette ""Beyond the Yellow Brick Road--The Making of TIN MAN""; behind the scene footage of director Nick Willing; a blooper reel; interviews with Nick Willing, Alan Cumming, Neal McDonough, and Zooey Deschanel; the original TIN MAN trailer, and trailers for THE MIST and THE HOGFATHER.",1234396800,18,4711,4.546208530805687

- The whole ""Grey Gale"" thing was really unnecessary. (no spoiler, you'll see when you get there)

I would like to say that Zooey portrays a wonderful heroine.  All heroes don't have to start at the bottom of their personalities to make a story.  DG has very strong traits to begin with and makes complete sense when you learn her background and inherant family traits.  Women can be portrayed as strong, logical and unflustered by crisis and grow from there.  Heroes are what we love for being themselves and being better at being themselves.

For those of you expecting a nice revisiting to the land of OZ, you will be thoroughly disappointed.  This revamped take on the classic fairytale does very little other than make very loose references to the original. For those of you who love sci fi, and wish that SOMEBODY would just try to make a fairytale with science fiction, then you might enjoy this.

Tin Man basically is a nice mixture of science fiction and magic rolled into one.  As I said before, there is very little reference to the Wizard of Oz except for one scene at the end where DG goes into Dorothy's black and white Kansas to retrieve the Green Emerald.  Other than that, the whole movie is an exciting story of mystery, suspense, with a plot that will keep you interested until the end.

There are some scary images, but I certainly wouldn't stop the average tween sci-fi enthusiast from seeing it.  And as with any fairytale, there is a predictable, but still somewhat heart-warming happy ending.",1229212800,,999,4.706896551724138
3054323,4,B0010X744G,"Prepare yourself for surprising and unexpected twists and turns in an Oz that even Judy Garland wouldn't be able to recognize. This time it's Zooey Deschanel as DG (i.e. Dorothy Gale), the traveler, or ""slipper"" between worlds who finds herself in a perilous situation that makes the original 1939 film look like a carefree walk in the park. Though this is a made-for-television mini-series the production values are stellar and the cast superior. I don't think Zooey has ever let me down and her courageous companions; Alan Cumming, Neal McDonough and Raoul Truijillo add a lot of energy and personality to keep the audience focused on this somewhat overly lengthy production. Kathleen Robertson was also a big plus as DG's older, allegedly evil sister Azkadellia, adding a much appreciated touch of sexuality to keep the adult, male audience occupied.

What really makes this storyline unique and entertaining is the massive use of creative license to adapt the original plot, landscape and characters into a new imaginative vision while still maintaining a credible link with the original cinematic classic. The first indication one gets that this tale will be different from what they're used to comes just by reading the title chosen for this mini-series. Why would they omit Oz and Dorothy from the title and call it `Tin Man'? To be sure more surprises lay ahead for the intrepid viewer. The second major change is the clever way in which the word Oz is changed from the name of a place to an acronym of a place. It's not Oz anymore, it's the O.Z. meaning the Outer Zone. Yes there are lots of subtle alterations like this to keep the viewing audience on its toes.

I was also pleased by the updated metamorphosis taken place within the ranks of DG's trio of fellow sojourners. The Scarecrow was no more, now replaced by Glitch (Cumming), a lobotomized human with a prominent zipper down the middle of his hairline, an ex-cop named Cain (McDough) nicknamed Tin Man because of the badge he used to carry and Raw (Truijillo), a member of a race of empathic, hairy, lion-like beings who possess the ability to read minds. Even little, loveable Toto has returned, but not in a form you would have ever anticipated. Toto is only the animal form of a shapeshifter known as Tutor when in human form. Be prepared for a lot more changes than just the few mentioned here.

On the negative side I'd have to mention the Evil Witches scheme to bring permanent darkness to the O.Z. wasn't very original. If you've seen `Kull the Conqueror' ('97) or `Hellboy ('07) you've seen it before. The other drawback is the length of the production which is a common concern when it comes to mini-series. About midway through you might find yourself losing interest, however If you make it to Part 3 the storyline accelerates and you'll find yourself infused with a shot of adrenaline with the introduction of several unanticipated plot maneuvers that will carry the now invigorated viewer to the end.",1226188800,2,2983,4.833659491193738

Still, these are very minor flaws when looked at as a whole and ones that can be forgiven.

My close-second (after Return to Oz) favorite film rendition of Oz is the recent SciFi miniseries, Tin Man. It keeps all the magic and fairy tale of the original works, but this time infusing it with new energy and more modern twists. This is a much more adult version of Oz, but it still maintains the perfect balances of magic and meaning, fairytale and modern images, and it is still distinctly American.

Baum, I believe, would have loved this clever adaptation of his stories. It totally keeps the spirit, the meaning, the heart, and the magic of the Oz tales. The magic is still here in the form of the American fairy tale: a brilliant blending of bits of American life (subberbia fallen, a doomsday machine, drugs, bars and psychics) and mechanisms (robots, super computers, hippie vans) with the land of the fairy (witches, monsters, princes and princesses). The symbolism/meaning of Baum is still here; the commentary on American life is still here.

DG (played by the wonderful Zooey Deschanel, who maintains a difficult balance between wide-eyed child and cynical adult, human and magical creature), like Ozma and other Oz heroines, is a little lost girl on her journey through a warped and symbolic version of her own world. She is a lost princess on the search for her identity. Like Dorothy, her greatest strength is her courage and her ability to make odd friends along the Brick Road.

In the O.Z., DG meets up with symbolic and damaged characters that help her on her way. The Scarecrow figure, Glitch, was once a high ranking bureaucrat, a Daedalous figure that made amazing inventions, some of which are being corrupted and used for great evil by the new government. Here is the threat of the cleverness and American inventiveness and modernization. Even worse, Glitch's brain has been tampered with, reducing him to a gibbering, amnesia-ridden idiot. He doesn't know who he was or what he has fallen from. The Tin Man, Cain, was locked in a tin box and forced to watch his family tortured and killed over and over again. A jaded ex-cop (or Tin Man), he may not be made out of metal, but his heart is certainly absent. Raw, a psychic and spiritual character, is part of a species that is abused for their powers and abilities. The evil witch, Az, uses drugs, spiritualism, brainwashing, torture, and machines to keep her power and do evil.

The production design is very clever. It keeps the magic and mystical nature of Baum's fairy tale (particularly reflecting the illustrations of the books with the girls costumes). It also borrows from the 1930s period (the time of the original film), but warping it into more Film Noir, so that--visually--we have the same world. For instance, the cars and nightclub, the girl's hair styles. Mixing fairy tale images with the Film Noir is a brilliant blend that creates modern darkness and an otherworly feel. Other images are a nod to the original story, particularly the bronze machines with very visible bolts and the electric beams. There is plenty of modern culture mixed in, too. This Oz, just as Baum's Oz, is populated by robots (who actually raised DG) who live in a now-run-down 1950s suburban town that was once a near-Utopia but is now reduced to rubble. DG's father flies a hot air balloon, just as the original wizard did.

The story has enough twists and turns and revelations, darkness and triumph, to maintain the many hours of the miniseries. But the real appeal is all the images and effects, the many very likeable and complicated characters played by quite talented actors. If you're a fan of the original Oz books, or just an adult that likes a good fairy tale, check this one out. It's from the guys that gave us the fantastic and thoroughly clever adult fairy tale, The 10th Kingdom. I hope they'll be giving us more, too.

Also, the DVD quality is fantastic (so much better than the televised version).",1215734400,3,3912,4.795252225519288

3054349,3,B0010X744G,"One thing that I missed from the 90's was the mini series. Back then they had some great ones, such as Stephen King's the Stand and Golden Years, It, just to name a few. I know there were others, but the titles of these evade me at the moment.

So, I was very pleased to see that over the past couple of years there have been several new mini series that have popped up, and quite a few of them have been from the Sci Fi Channel.

And, thanks to DVD's, I've been able to purchase these DVD's and have been able to watch these mini series at my leisure... which usually means watching the entire thing in one shot because my wife hates to wait.

The first one I bought and watched was the mini series called Tin Man. This was a re-imagining of the classic Wizard of Oz.

And I do mean re-imagining.

Now, I have stated before I've never read the original Oz novel, but I did read Wicked. I will also state that this mini series had far more in common with the Wicked novel than it did the original Wizard of Oz movie starring Judy Garland.

D. G., a young woman working as a waitress feels that she doesn't belong. Sure, her family loves her dearly and they are close, but she never felt at home.

Well, as you can imagine, there is a good reason for this. This world, the family she's with, she doesn't actually belong here at all. She was actually born in the O.Z, or the Outer Zone.

And it isn't until she finds herself under attack from complete strangers in the middle of a storm that she learns the truth.

One unexpected tornado ride later, she finds herself deposited in a strange and unsettlingly familiar world.

It's in this world that she discovers her true heritage, and the truth behind her parents, and the people she believed were her parents.

Just like in the original movie, D.G. finds companions on her journey. A former Advisor to the Queen, who's had his brain removed, the Tin Man, a police officer with vengeance on his mind, and a hirsute man who can see images through emotions - and who is quite the coward.

Sound familiar?

The mini series is a quest. D.G. has to locate the powerful Mystic Man in a Vegas like city to find out where she needs to go next and what she's to do to fulfill her destiny.

Visually it was quite impressive, although the acting was pretty average, as none of the actors in the movie really stuck out in my mind.

The movie starred Zooey Deschanel starred as D.G., Alan Cumming as Glitch, Neal McDonough as the Tin Man, Raoul Trujillo as Raw, Kathleen Robertson as Azkadellia and Richard Drefuss as the Mystic Man.

I have to admit that despite the fact that it had so little to do with what I remember about the Wizard of Oz, I was enthralled by the mini series and I did enjoy it.

Even though it was quite clich in parts.

The one thing that set it apart from a full length series is that it had a clearly defined beginning, middle and end. There really wasn't any `filler' as you would find in a typical series, which meant that the writers could tell the story in one shot.

I hope that this won't be construed as a spoiler, but near the end of the mini series it is discovered that it is, in fact, more of a sequel than an actual re-imagining. I don't know about other people, but I liked that.

The world itself is a mixture of magic and modern technology. You have powerful sorcerers, people who can read thoughts, Tornados that can break the barriers between worlds, but you also have gun-slingers, automobiles and the like.

It was worth watching, and I found it quite enjoyable. It certainly has renewed my interest in the mini series, something we haven't seen in a very long time.

This, at the time of me writing this review is just the first of four mini series that I have and will be watching. The Lost Room, Triangle and the Andromeda Strain.

3054355,5,B0010X744G,"When the Wizard of Oz was first released during the Great Depression, my Dad was a ten year old providing for his family by farm labor (picking cotton by hand etc) in the Arizona ""farmland"" around Eloy Arizona. When I was a child he related the story to me of how he paid to get in to see The Wizard of Oz for the first time, he traded the metallic tops off of milk bottles.

When I was a boy growing up in the wonderland now known as the ""OC"" (five miles from Disneyland, 1 mile from Knott's berry farm (of course back then it was a berry farm) and 12 miles from Huntington Beach) my favorite day of the year was the night that The Wizard of Oz would come on TV. Then, in 1967 when we got our first ""Color TV"" I loved it even more. Then came the age of VHS, and DVD and as my children grew up, we have watched the Wizard of Oz over and over every year, and the My first grand-daughter got old enough to watch it, it also became a favorite of hers. So for Four generations The Wizard of Oz has been a favorite in my family.

So when I saw advertisements, for Tin Man on Sci-Fi Channel, I had a certain amount of trepidation for watching what I assumed would be a retelling of one of my all time favorite films. I didn't get around to setting the TIVO to record it when it came on and I forgot all about it until I saw it for sale at a club store. I still didn't want to get it enough to buy it until one of my colleagues told me how much he liked it. So.... This weekend I got around to buying TIN MAN.

Here is my take.

Tin Man is not a re-telling of The Wizard of Oz. It takes place in the future of Dorothy's visit. It is a darker slightly more mature tale, probably not appropriate for pre-teens.

Wizard of Oz was a wonderful musical, Tin Man is a straight up fantasy. I think this is a wise decision.  Musicals should be left to Disney for the time being.

Wizard of Oz, had really cutting edge effects for the time, but are quite cheesy by today's standards, Tin Man had amazing special affects. Wizard of Oz had very funny parts, which were kind of lacking in Tin Man. Metaphors were different in both movies some played better in one, and some better in the other. But the two big metaphors still stand out, from the Wizard of Oz home is the place that is important, and in Tin Man family is who is important.  I also liked the aspect of redemption and resolution that was the gist of the story of Tin Man.

So is Tin Man destined to be a classic on the order of the Wizard of Oz? I'd say probably not. Is it a very good way to spend a few hours of your time? Absolutely, it is one of the best new things I have seen in quite some time. Is it well spent money? Absolutely, I think I will watch this several times more, just not as many times as I have watched the Wizard of Oz.

If you like a fantasy film with a modern twist, beautifully filmed with a bit of cheese on top, then this is a film for you",1210636800,2,2912,3.979416809605489

3054358,4,B0010X744G,"I must admit that I was hesitant to watch SciFi Channel's revisioning of ""The Wizard of Oz"" due to the fact that they were heavily promoting it.  I've learned through the years that 95% of all films, television series, and music that is heavily hyped is usually not that great in the end.  I was pleasantly surprised with this excellent story written by Craig Van Sickle and Steven Long Mitchell.  The tale centers around D.G., a young girl who doesn't feel like she fits in her hometown.  Her parents always talk of better times in a town that seems otherworldly.  Little does she know that there is another place in the magical and mystical O.Z.  When she's chased into a tornado, D.G. finds herself in a world where the wicked Azkadellia and her goons (including flying monkeys) are out to retrieve a secret from her that she doesn't even know she has.  Along the way, D.G. meets a group of unlikely heroes like the goofy Glitch, the sensitive Raw, and the standoffish Cain.  What's D.G.'s secret? Who's the Mystic Man?  What destiny awaits D.G. and her friends?  Watch ""Tin Man"" to find out.

Directed by Nick Willing, ""Tin Man"" features an excellent cast.  The lovely Zooey Deschanel portrays D.G.  Kathleen Robertson is wickedly fun as Azkadellia.  Alan Cumming shines as Glitch, and steals many scenes in this film.  Raoul Trujillo, who's known to fans of SciFi Channel's ""Frankenfish"" as Ricardo, displays solid emotion as the tortured Raw.  Richard Dreyfuss does an excellent, albeit brief, job as the Mystic Man.  Neal McDonough portrays the title character, and his performance begs the question as to why he hasn't broken out as a legitimate star in his own right.

The special effects are very good for a made-for-TV story.  The music is above par as well.  Willing drives the story along at a solid pace, littering it with a nice blend of humor, suspense and action.  Fans of  L. Frank Baum's book and the classic film adaptation will see plenty of nods to both.

The DVD's special features are okay, but nothing really stands out except for the interviews of the primary cast.  McDonough and Cumming provide the most interesting interviews.  There's a gag reel that's more of a silly documentary than actual goofs. There is also""On The Set With The Director,"" and ""Beyond The Yellow Brick Road,"" which gives the viewer a look behind the scenes.

As a whole, SciFi Channel and co. have outdone themselves with this mini-series.  They acquired a solid cast, good special effects and excellent direction and produced a wonderful new vision of a classic tale.  Highly recommended to fans of fantasy and sci-fi as well as fans of children's fantasy tales.  There is a bit of language and some violence, but parents should feel safe letting their older kids (seven and up) watch this film with them.

3054360,3,B0010X744G,"Tin Man was a Sci Fi Channel mini-series where a more modern look is taken of Frank Baums The Wizard of Oz.  As with the original, the main character is a young lady from Kansas, rather than going by the name Dorothy though, she's called DG.  Also rather than being the cheerful girl who sings us along the Yellow Brick Road we have a young lady who's a little darker and feeling she's missing something in her life.  Btw, for those not familiar, OZ in this telling is short for Outer Zone.

The Good
I loved the Tin Man character.  Neal McDonough does a very good job showing us a man with heart and I also loved the setup for why he's that way.  Alan Cumming does a good job as Glitch (the Scarecrow), and I enjoyed Kathleen Robertson (the wicked witch) and Zooey Deschanel (DG)in the first portion of the movie.  Also, Richard Dryfus does a great job as the Mystic Man (the Wizard).  Very interesting...
Story wise I loved the set up for the characters.  The background for DG, Glitch, Tin Man and Raw (the Lion) are interesting.  I also found myself interested in DG's family background, the relationship to the Wicked Witch, and also the relationship between this telling of the Wizard of Oz and the original (very nicely done when DG meets Dorothy Gale).  The other big plus is showing  OZ as being a dark place.  This was best shown with Central City.

The Bad
The worst bad was the bad guys.  Zero was a Zero.  The bad guys were incompetent and you almost have the feeling that if it weren't for the flying monkeys that DG and the rest would have walked away with everything.  In the story telling department part 2 dragged a little.  Some movements in the story were abrupt; others weren't finished very well because they chose to follow the stereotype.  The worst part of this is when we go from the Central City to the Ice Palace on the Northern Island and DG meets her sister and becomes her prisoner.  Other weaknesses included Raw and his kind; while nice it just didn't sell as well as it might have; and the bad guys equipment.  A surplus M-3 halftrack, an armored car, and some guys running around in dusters with firearms just didn't impress me.  If the director would have dropped the WWII surplus and the dusters it might have been better.

These were lacking to put it simply.  Yes they have interviews with the director (in about three different versions) but nothing that moved me.  I was looking for cut scenes, wardrobe, and there one called Bloopers I was expecting Bloopers rather than looking at the behind the scene staff.

The Rating
I'll call this one 3.5 stars.  I enjoyed the setup but the middle part almost put me to sleep.  I do admire the effort that was done with this and I do believe the director should have had a real shot at a true mini-series (three episodes isn't enough.  1 or 2 more would have been better for the story).  That said, I don't believe this is truly 4 star material.  It's enjoyable and I'll watch it again but it's not something that will draw me to it on a regular bases.",1209254400,5,3051,4.443243243243243

Return to OZ with DG for the adventure of a lifetime. DG is stuck in a dead end job and is a part time student at a community college when suddenly men in black appear and try to kill her and her parents. Her parents throw her into a Tornado and she lands in the O.Z.

So many people are bored with the original version of the 'Wizard of OZ' and the new generation needed an updated version. The cast is marvelously enchanting and the director and crew are truly 'Wizards' in their own right and the writing is inspired. ""There's no place like the O.Z.""",1208908800,2,745,5.526315789473684

Great acting, great cast, great plot ... although the ""blooper reel"" wasn't really what you'd expect when you think of a blooper.  There's really only one line mess up and it's up for debate over whether Alan Cummings did it on purpose.  I think he did.",1208649600,,628,4.513274336283186

3054369,5,B0010X744G,"""Tin Man (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"" is a superb reworking of both L. Frank Baum's ""Wizard of Oz"" and the classic 1939 film loosely based on it, skillfully weaving elements of both, while creating a world uniquely it's own. This is an Oz with real magic, and equal parts of wonder, humor, and terror, a land I didn't want to leave!

Much of the credit goes to the Jill E. Blotevogel, Steven Long Mitchell, and Craig W. Van Sickle teleplay, which avoids the slavish devotion to the 1939 film of previous ""Oz"" incarnations. While it tackles some classic questions from the original movie, head on (""Was Glinda actually Dorothy's mother, as her character was the only one in the film without a Kansas counterpart?""), it also reminds viewers that Baum's book wasn't only an American fairy tale, but a cautionary fable of industrial 'progress' butting heads with an agrarian society. Oz is a land of change, a multitude of cultures, and the uneasy coexistence of sorcery with a rising machine culture.

Keeping all this from becoming too 'heavy' is director Nick Willing's tongue-in-cheek humor, and a terrific cast, headed by Zooey Deschanel as a less-than-reverent DG. Her skepticism and growing awareness of her actual role in events is the core of the film, and she is quite wonderful. Equally good are her companions, Alan Cumming as zipper-headed ""Glitch"" (his brain was stolen), Neal McDonough as an ex-lawman (first encountered imprisoned in a metallic 'suit'), and Raoul Trujillo (looking remarkably like Bert Lahr) as a cowardly member of a lion-like telepathic species. Yes, Toto is here, too (but there is a surprise I'll let you discover when you view the film!)

The witches and wizards are a major treat of the film, although Richard Dreyfuss' role, based on the Wizard of Oz, himself, is smaller than you'd expect. However, lovely Kathleen Robertson, as the wicked witch Azkadellia, is fabulous, with an old crone within her every bit as ugly as Margaret Hamilton!

There is so much to enjoy in ""Tin Man"", and so many subtle references to Baum's vision and the 1939 film, that it simply can't be viewed only once. I've watched it three times, and I'm STILL finding things...

The story line is thin and predictable. The acting is weak with the oh so bad forced dialogue. The CGI's are all substandard at best. The fight scenes are so bad you could see a foot of space between the characters who were supposedly getting hit. This whole thing is not convincing in any way shape or form.

Don't get me wrong. I am not the kind of person to dole out bad reviews. I like most fantasy fiction and much science fiction and appreciate it for where it originated and how it is done. This dvd just turned me off.

I would not recommend anyone to buy this. Maybe rent it first and then make up you own mind.

3054399,4,B0010X744G,"First off, the first thing you see is the cover. Well, the holographic foil on the paperboard sleeve is pretty striking. (Wait... The paperboard sleeve is the collectible O-Ring packaging?) Only problem is... the original cover design (and an early poster) were pretty dynamic. This falls a little flat.

Okay, when you insert the first DVD (both of which look pretty nice, but you can easily tell which one is which), you get the copyright notice, the company notice, some previews (which I didn't note, but there's quite a few), then the menu has a nice animation, and a nice little movie showing clips from the whole series. (Disc 2 is the same, without the previews.)

Disc 1 has Part 1 and Part 2 on it, no special features. Also absent is alternate language tracks, alternate audio tracks (so no commentary), and subtitles. (There is also no Closed Captions, but this isn't on a DVD menu.) There are scene selections, eight scenes for each part, and the scene selections for each part run into each other, reminding you that these are both parts of one story.

The story opens with a young woman named DG who lives in Kansas with her folks. She has strange dreams where she sees strange scenes and a beautiful woman with lavendar eyes speaks and sings to her. She is a free spirit, ready to tease Officer Elmer Gulch (yes, you heard right) on her motorcycle.

But a storm is coming...

DG and her parents are surprised one night by men in strange trenchcoats. DG is led to the roof by her parents and is made to jump into a tornado!
DG awakes in a strange country, where she finds ruin from her house in Kansas, no sign of her parents, and midgets who capture her, believing her to be a spy of the Sorceress Azkadelia. While imprisoned, she meets Glitch, a man with a zipper in his skull. Half of his brain has been removed, so ""sometimes my synapses don't fly right."" He reveals that DG has entered ""The O.Z.,"" the Outer Zone.

DG and Glitch escape, and wind up rescuing Wyatt Cain, a Tin Man, one of the Mystic Man's police force. Cain helps them save Raw (a ""viewer,"" a half beast/half man race. Raw himself bears a resemblance to the portrayals of the Cowardly Lion by Bert Lahr and Ted Ross.) from becoming dinner in the Fields of the Papay.

As they take the Old Road (or ""The Brick Route"") to Central City, DG discovers that the O.Z. is in fact her home. She finds her ""parents"" (or, as they call themselves, ""nurture units"") are more android than human. In fact, they are not her parents. Her mother seems to be the mysterious woman from her dreams.

DG and her comrades make it to Central City, where they see the Mystic Man, who reveals that DG needs to unlock her memories, so DG must go north.

As DG journeys the O.Z., she (and we, as the audience) discovers many fascinating items of her past. Azkadelia is wicked, or is she? Who are her parents? Who was the other girl she lived with in the O.Z.? What secrets lie in the past of Glitch and Cain? And what is the Emerald of the Eclipse, and where is it?

The acting in Tin Man is superb. Zooey Deschanel as DG is endearing, although some feel her natural charm was wasted on the role. Alan Cumming is hilarious and serious as Glitch, pulling off the role with a professional air. Neal McDonough is dead-serious as Cain, but can be emotional when he needs to. Raoul Trujillo is excellent at re-inventing the mighty, sniveling beast. And Kathleen Robertson... WOW! She pulls off evil in a way that rivals Tilda Swinton!

The special effects and CG are almost believable. Not quite lifelike, but these work excellently.

The story is captivating and intriguing. The writing is simply delicious. However, something lacks: there is a lot of backstory not explained in the 4 & 1/2 hours that Tin Man approximately runs for. I would like to see the story continue, myself. Maybe a sequel, or TV series, or series of sequels?

The video quality is very good. I believe it's the best definition you can get on a standard DVD. The episodes have been extended. There are additional little scenes, like more fun with Glitch, more evilness with Azkadelia, and more tracking with Cain. These scenes neither make the series better nor make it worse.

Disc 2 only has Part 3 and the Special Features. Part 3 is also extended.

In addition, the opening title card and credits are now absent from parts 2 & 3 (but the video is still there) and there is no end credits on parts 1 & 2, and the opening credits on part 1 and the end credits on part 3 have been expanded to cover the entire series.

The Special Features are quite good, making this another rarity when it comes to Oz DVDs. (Very few have good special features.)

First up is the ""Beyond the Yellow Brick Road: The Making of Tin Man"" feature. This was aired on SciFi about a week before the miniseries (and was also a popular bootleg download and the only feature available on bootleg Tin Man DVDs), so this makes it a nice addition.

Next up is a new documentary: ""On The Set With The Director,"" a documentary that, once again, goes behind the scenes and lets the cast and crew talk about working with director Nick Willing.

Now we have the ""Blooper Reel."" Ah, yes. We all love to see the cast mess up on their lines and cues... except that doesn't happen much here. It's mostly the crew joking around and the cast having downtime. Still fun to watch, but it should have been called by a different name.

Next up is raw footage of interviews with Nick Willing, Zooey Deschanel, Alan Cumming, and Neal McDonough. Some of this, if you're watching the special features sequentially, will sound familiar, as some of it was used in the featurettes. You can also faintly hear the interviewer asking questions and the director, actor or actress listening to them. This can be a little distracting, but most of the time it is bearable. Sadly, Miss Deschanel is not a good interviewee. She even has to ask the interviewer to re-state the actual question. We do learn some interesting things about the cast and crew, though.

Finally is the full-length Tin Man trailer. This was all over the Internet, and probably on SciFi, too, so you've probably seen it.

All in all, if I had to rate this DVD on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give it an 8. Lack of subtitles, closed captioning (come on, fans whipped up a set of subtitles for the bootleg video files), and the special features, while there is a considerable amount, could have been a bit better.

I say, add it to your Oz collection. It's probably the best re-imagining of Oz that goes far-out while not raping Baum's original vision that we'll get for a long time.

If you buy the DVD at Borders, specially marked DVDs have an exclusive premium, an acetane pouch with a third disc inside the case.

The menu is not unlike the Special Features on Disc 2. We have three selections here. The first two are fancily titled interviews with Kathleen Robertson and Raoul Trujillio. These are much like the interviews on Disc 2, the actor and actress not in costume, seated in what looks like one of the sets, answering questions from the same interviewer, who we can't hear any better than we could before. Both Kathleen and Raoul interview very well, and the interviews are a little over ten minutes long each.

The other item is over a half-hour long. It shows behind-the-scenes footage of the Mystic Man's show, including a deleted item wherein Zooey Deschanel's DG asks the Mystic Man for help. (We also get a good look at some decor at the show: a pillar shaped like a cyclone with many farmhouse items being spun around in it.) However, the repeated takes of the Mystic Man's show gets old very quickly. To be sure, this gives you a taste of what it's like to work on a film, but when you're not involved, it gets dull.

As with many premium bonus DVDs, this disc is not completely satisfying, but it is nice to see these uncut interviews with Kathleen and Raoul. As afore mentioned, the behind-the-scenes of the Mystic Man gives us a realistic glimpse of how much time is taken to shoot a scene that runs for just a few minutes. Altogether, not a bad addition.

This is a movie the entire family can enjoy.  Tho it is quite a different take from the Oz version we are used to seeing, everything is explained. No sex and some tame violence.

Ms Deschanel had one expression-----wide-eyed something for every situation that came along.  The story lurched along with big gaps in the story line.

3054404,4,B0010X744G,"Tin Man is a Sci-Fi channel miniseries that came out in late 2007.  It is a remake of the Wizard of Oz story; supposedly set several generations after the original Judy Garland version of the Wizard of Oz.  As a remake, many things have changed.  First of, Dorothy is not a blond-haired, blue-eyed prudish girl.  Instead, we have DG, a disillusioned tomboyish teenager with black hair and a subtle ""whatever"" attitude.  She is transported to the OZ (short for Outer Zone) by a tornado, but once there the story is very different.  She does meet a tin man, who is actually a local sheriff.  There is a cowardly lion, though with very impressive powers, and instead of a scarecrow, we have a lobotomized scientist with hidden martial arts skills.

This OZ does have a wicked witch, though instead of old and ugly, she is actually a hot babe who dresses provocatively.  Like the original version, there is a great secret revealed, though here it relates to the wicked witch.  I personally like this story better as it is very original, with none of the traditional cliches.  So I give this a 5/5 stars for the storyline.

However, the execution could have been better.  The audio and visual effects were all believable, and the cinematography was good.  What was lacking was the costumes.  For a land far far away, all the good guys wore dresses similar to what Americans wore during the 1940s and 50s.  And the witch's henchman dress eerily like Nazis.  So lack of innovation in the costume.  The soundtrack is also quite repetitive, and seems better suited for trailer music.  A movie like this deserves a full blown orchestral score.  So for execution, I give this movie 3/5 stars.

My final disappointment was the lack of subtitles.  Overall, a good movie and worth the time to watch it.  But not spectacular.",1206403200,,1810,4.712460063897764

There are the obvious parallels: Cain/Tin Man, DG/Dorothy, Azkadelia/WWotW, etc. and then there are the more subtle things. DG's calm manner and witty one liners mirror Dorothy's easy acceptance of a world that should have been terrifying, the trek to the Northern Palace, the ways in which each was injured during the fight at said Northern Palace, etc.

3054429,1,B0010X744G,"This was disappointing overall. I was excited when I heard they were doing a sci-fi version of the story, but in the back of my mind there was this gnawing doubt that turned out to be dead on correct. Hollywood, especially television, is a wasteland with very few pleasant spots, and here is yet another tumbleweed rolling by.
I understand that a great deal of people enjoyed this miniseries which Sci-Fi Channel dubbed 'The Event of the Year'. I am not attacking them, I am simply expressing my own opinion of this presentation.

For me this was simply another digital effects laden film that did not have very much to offer. The idea of a new twist on L. Frank Baum's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (which is what this miniseries was touted as being) sounded interesting, but the result was pure disappointment. The creators of this project seemed to not have even cracked open the original Baum book. When I first learned that this was going to be based on the book, I hoped for scenes that involved the Quadling Country, the China People, the mice, the green eyeglasses, a one-eyed witch with control over bees and wolves. What I got was typical fare of today's TV movies, and it wasn't surprising at all. Sci-Fi Channel's original movies are hardly good entertainment anyway.

It's a shame because this movie could have been good. Between the original book and the MGM musical, there is much to play with in terms of story and themes. But it was all lifeless, washed out looking, dull, and even cringe-inducing at times. ""The little bitch has gone to see the wizard."" Come on. Really? And the Azkadelia character (or Vidalia or Azkaban or whatever she's called) had just two expressions: icy suppressed rage and snide sarcasm. Not a threatening villain in the least for me. And the whole sisters plot idea is from the moon.

The Oz material is really a children's territory, and when you twist it into adult fantasy it doesn't work well at all. See Gregory Macguire's novel ""Wicked"" with its adult themes, byzantine writing style, and transformation of an evil witch into a misunderstood misfit and an animal rights activist. Eeew.

And at times, ""Tin Man"" almost shows glimmers of interest, but then a character will open his mouth and say the most cliched, trite bit of corny drivel, and remind you instantly that you are watching something that is not good. It's unfortunate that so much potential was there and yet the end result was just another shoddy piece of Hollywood nonsense.",1202342400,33,2492,4.735023041474655

3054431,3,B0010X744G,"WARNING:  SOME SPOILERS

I loved the premise behind this--a darker, more adult, epic fantasy version of the Wizard of Oz.  I was actually pretty psyched about seeing this.  Did it deliver?  Well, kind of.

The plot moves along at a good clip for the most part, and the special effects are surprisingly well-done for a made-for-TV miniseries.  I liked that the monkey bats seemed to be some sort of puppetry or stop motion rather than entirely CGI.  But overall, I was left with the feeling that this series could have been so much better.

One of the biggest problems for me was the dialogue.  Tin Man suffers from a severe case of ""writer speak""--characters spout lots of ""clever"" lines that no real person would ever say.  It doesn't help that Zooey Deschanel seems to be locked into a narrow range of acting.  I don't know if it's her fault or the director's, but regardless of what's going on she conveys a deadpan, sardonic nonchalance.  When she's swept into another world by a supernatural storm, she takes it in stride with a shrug and a quip.  When the munchkins (now a bunch of psychotic, ugly tree-dwelling trolls) discuss torturing her for information, she seems only mildly disgruntled.  ""You're out of your tiny minds,"" she tells them, in the same complaining tone someone might say, ""This burger is overdone.""  I understand that they wanted her to be a tough heronine.  Fine, but a little bit of realistic human emotion wouldn't hurt.  A lot of the cutesy abbreviations got to me, as well.  Dorothy Gale is now ""DG.""  Oz is ""the O.Z.""  I'm surprised the Wizard wasn't ""the Big W"" or something.

My other main complaint is the villain's motive, or non-motive, rather.  Azkadallia wants some special emerald she can put into a machine that will blot out the sun and engulf the O.Z. in darkness.  Why?  What is that going to accomplish?  In the original Wizard of Oz the Wicked Witch is one-dimensionally evil for no reason--which is forgivable, considering that it's a children's book.  Tin Man is supposed to be a more serious, adult version of the tale, so I was hoping for a more complex and realistic villain.  There's a bit of a twist toward the end revealing that Azkadallia is possessed by some kind of evil entity resembling a witch, but that doesn't change much.  We still have a main villain (the witch entity) who does evil things for no apparent reason.  No moral ambiguity here.

Despite all this, I don't regret watching Tin Man.  There were some genuinely funny moments and enough twists and turns in the plot to keep me engaged.  But though it was entertaining, I didn't feel like it really left me with anything to think about.",1201996800,104,2657,4.681818181818182

Ok, so they kept the flying monkees but they took the liberty to do an entirely different show and went an entirely different direction that I ever would have thought possible.

I have seen Zooey in other movies and have felt that her deadpan characters were charming and worked for the most part in other movies.

3054451,4,B0010X744G,"I've been dieing for a good Fantasy mini-series to come along for awhile now. It's been awhile since Merlin or the 10th Kingdom. Tin Man may hack the Wizard of Oz story to bits trying to recreate the story and it succeeds in being entertaining even if it is silly. Tin Man is just fun and well acted and I honestly didn't even want it to end. Neal McDonough (Walking Tall) I always thought of as poor man's Ray Liotta but he gives what should be a star making performance. He gives the more interesting performance of the mini-series. He plays Cain who's a former Tin Man ""the name of the police of the O Z"" who is a broken man due to his haunting past.

  I always had a crush on Zooey Deschanel since Elf but I'm still not even sure if she was good as DG or not. She has a lovely voice so the one part I think she really shined is when she sings in one part. Other than that she acts just a little too dopey and expressionless. Alan Cumming is fun as a bit of a fruit ""but cool fruit lol"" that had his brain stolen by Azkadellia ""the Witch"". I find it strange that he doesn't remember much yet he remembers that he can dance and takes out some guards with his dance moves. But hey it's all good fun anyway. Kathleen Robertson as Azkadellia makes a sexy villain but the fact that the flying monkeys fly out of a tattoo on her cleavage almost kills an almost flawless and fun mini-series. Oh plus you might even find it dumb that the Cowardly Lion's name is...Raw and that he's a....psychic or that Toe Toe is a shape shifter.

3054478,5,B0010X744G,"I agree this is a brilliant re-imagining of the original Wizard of OZ. There are such masterful turns and metaphors that take time to figure out long after viewing. For instance, it took me time to realize that the Grey Gale referred to the original version which was in sepia and when DG encounters Dorothy  Gale she is in black and white with the exception of her slippers and the red 39 on the heart outside the farmhouse (referring back to the original year the Wizard of Oz was made)--but the Dorothy Gale that DG found was gray (the gray gale). Also the way that Emerald City gets reused as the quest for the Emerald and power. Alot of people have questioned the title of the mini-series because the tin man wasn't the central character but I think that the tin man becomes a metaphor for the way that each character is locked in their own prison helplessly watching as destruction seems to fill their lives and they fight to get out of those prisons. The end was a bit schmaltzy for my taste -- all the twists and turns in the plot kept me hopping so I was expecting a bit more of bang. I thought the performances were first-rate and the difficulty of taking an overly dramatic musical and turning it into a drama that was believable and not overblown was key--I think Zooey Deschanel's DG was spot on in having the right amount of sarcasm and bewilderment and she really pulled you into the story. I am awaiting the DVD--it will be refreshing to watch it in one sitting instead of across three nights. Other critics have been less than generous to this effort but it isn't the sort of thing that one grabs at one sitting--it really does require that you think back to the details of the original as well as become involved in a new world. I can't say enough good things about Tin man. It is so smart on so many levels that I think it flew over so many critics heads and they just didn't want to spend the time to figure out how the plot grabbed so many details from the Wizard of Oz and used them to tell a whole new story. I highly recommend this for everyone.",1198022400,10,2069,4.332474226804123
3054479,5,B0010X744G,I was shocked on how great of a story this was and the parts of the wizard of oz all meant something different which made it even more interesting. The visuals int he movie were amazing (minus the creatures)but the scenery was beautiful to say the least. I would recommend watching this is you are into fantasy epic films,1197936000,4,321,4.4576271186440675
3054480,5,B0010X744G,"I have to say, during the first little bit of it, I was skeptical.  But, by the time I finished the first third (it was a three part mini-series), and started the second third from my DVR, I was TOTALLY hooked.  I couldn't get to the second third of it fast enough.  It is an excellent adaptation.  I can't wait for the DVD.  I am a HUGE fan of adaptations with a twist, and this was definately a good book adaptation.  I watched all 6 hours of it in one night.  It was amazing.  WELL worth the time to watch it.  Though the ending was a little bit predictible, especially once you learn what happened to the girls, but it is still VERY well acted, and VERY well put together.  I have not seen a ""Made For TV"" movie/mini-series that has captured my attention like this since Dr. Zhivago.  Well WELL done!  Thank you!",1197849600,4,816,4.2272727272727275
3054481,5,B0010X744G,"I really enjoyed this mini-series, which I just finished watching this afternoon (I've got kids, so it took me a while...). Anyway, I REALLY enjoyed this movie, which is why I gave it five stars. The acting was great, the characters flawless. However, I found the ending unsatisfying. I understand there were time constraints, but the movie just kind of ended abruptly with no satisfying tying together of all the plot-lines (like Glitch getting his brain back and Cain and his son finding closure with Adora's death and Zero, to name just a couple). The movie would have been better had it spent a bit of time actually tying everything up. I'm one of those people who, when a story ends, likes to see all the loose ends tied up nice and tidy. That's why I personally LOVED the ending to the Lord of the Rings movies. Everything was tied up beautifully. I hope the DVD includes a bit more of a proper ending than the original airing did.",1197763200,5,937,4.550295857988166
3054482,5,B0010X744G,"""Tin Man"" exceeded my wildest dreams! Forget blowing ""The Wizard of Oz"" out of the water; ""Tin Man"" blew ""The Wizard of Oz"" out of the universe! The story was so deep and original it was amazing. The acting was surprisingly great as well, especially for the four main characters. I HIGHLY suggest watching/buying this show/movie! The only negative thing I can think of is the title, it doesn't really fit. The title should have been ""The O.Z."" or something like that.",1197676800,4,467,4.7073170731707314
3054483,5,B0010X744G,"I was rewatching the making of Tin Man and noticed that there are scenes that they show in that, that did not make it into the final product. A main one is when (spoiler) Cain finds where his family has taken refuge (pt2) and he see what his son was exposed to while in the tin suite, His wifes death by Zero. In the making you see a lot of that scene and Cain shutting down the device. And they talk about alot of storyline they had to cut out. I hope they put that back in or at least put it on the DVD when it gloriously comes out. I know I'm already in line for it. I hope they spoil us with a lot of extras and another mini series or series. I'll take either, but it needs the original cast. NO recasting. Love Tin Man! See yeah down the old road.",1197590400,7,752,3.8896103896103895
3054494,5,B0010X744G,"It is rare that a remake or reinterpretation of a story can surpass an original classic, but this is definitely an exception. Tin Man was very well written to provide a different twist into the story of OZ and then tie it back to the orginal. The cinematography and special effects put the requisite 'bigger than life' feel to this story, and the casting and acting couldn't have been better. This was the first time I've seen Zooey Deschanel at work and her visual expressions coupled with her down-to-earth acting made this story really come together. Two thumbs up!",1197331200,6,568,4.747474747474747
3054495,5,B0010X744G,"Anyone looking for a remake should turn the other direction. Instead what you get is a TRULY FANTASTIC movie that plays as a sequel of sorts to the original classic. This is a twisted, wonderful, and very unique spin to the Wizard of Oz. I stress that this is NOT a remake, but an original plot with elements of the original story thrown in.

Be patient. It does have a slow start, but keep watching, and you will be amazed. With its darker vibe, I would not recommend it for younger audiences, but adults should be enthralled. Great ""character"" acting and wonderful imagination top it off. Alan Cumming does an excellent job as Glitch, the brainless sidekick. Neal McDonough is perfect in the masculine role of a ""Tin Man"". Kathleen Robertson is also perfection as the wicked Azkadellia.

The DVD lacks a bit with special features, but the enhanced graphics and sound make it worth the purchase.

With a reported budget just under $20 million for a six-hour made-for-TV Movie, my kudos go out to the special effects team. It's no movie fare (this is Sci-Fi), but it certainly is eye-catching; really something to see. Standouts are ""Central City"" and the ""Ice Palace"".

This is pure entertainment for those with lengthy and active imaginations.

I highly recommend this for all sci-fi and fantasy lovers!

If there is one flaw, it's the ending. It tied up the basic loose end, but not everything, and I suspect a sequel is in the works. Considering the record breaking ratings, I would hope!

Here's to a sequel!",1197331200,5,1513,4.730038022813688

My only complaint was the way they tried to link it to the original Dorothy Gale.  Not enough time had gone by unless time flows very differently in the OZ.

It was also interesting to see how they would do this or that part from the original in this one. They are all there all though you might not get it right away.

The acting was good, especially the TinMan, Glitch, and Raw.",1197244800,5,515,4.151515151515151

I will certainly purchase the DVD so I can enjoy escapism to its fullest.",1197244800,4,379,4.588235294117647
3054502,5,B0010X744G,"If you are expecting ruby slippers and a cackling green lady, you are in for an awakening of your own.  Growing up with singing munchkins, I realized, hey, I am a grownup.  And SciFi seemed to realize it too with a magnificent departure from the 1939 MGM film to a brilliant, futuristic, decadent, and sometimes apocalyptic telling.  The reinventions of characters and fantastical sets soon transport you from the familiar to a place you find yourself hard to take your eyes off of-- from phosphorous-glowing trees, desolate paths, Metropolitan-like art deco palaces, and underworlds unlike anything and then again reminiscent of a certain alphabet city pre-Rudy.

The story itself is not for the kiddies.  Mine were told continuously to leave the room, go play, and find something else to do.  But the grown up fairy tale is long overdue.  The story actually had twists, turns, and menacing meaning-- much more substance and meaning than the trifles the network and cable gurus seem to thrust down our throats.

I honestly cannot wait until the DVD comes out to feast my peepers on the rich masterpiece SciFi laid out for the holidays.  (A much better smorgasborg than the Cheeto-fare of Lifetime).

And for just desserts-- SciFi scored an incredible coup with incredibly gifted actors perfectly tailored for each role-- most notably Alan Cumming for Glitch, Neal McDonough as the titular Tin Man, and the remarkable ""evil"" Azkadelia played by Kathleen Robertson.

Evil no longer is a personality trait to just carry a plot, but in this series, actually has a real beginning, reason to exist, and a true part in throughout the series up to the climatic end.  This series is like a force of nature that I found myself carried away in-- somewhat like DG.",1197244800,209,1753,4.925170068027211

That being said, I really enjoyed it, all six hours of it on the Sci-fi channel.  Anyway, I will definitely be purchasing this when it comes out.

DG -- Dorothy Gale, what a no-brainer there.  Alan Cummings is very entertaining as the Scarecrow, the rest of the cast is just meh.,  This is the hugest snoozefest from a long line of insomnia breakers out of the hands of master rip-off artist Nick Willing.  How the hell he managed to get Richard Dreyfus sucked into this sack of crap is a true mystery, and  Dreyfus gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm not really enchanted by Nick Willing's appropriation of other people's ideas.

3288200,4,B0010X744G,"Is it a classic like the 1938 film? No, it has some issues. But it is well worth the purchase of the DVD set. The effects are only so-so considering the level they are at in 2007. More SyFy channel than major motion picture quality, but I don't think that detracts a great deal from the story. They aren't horrible, just could have been better.

But the story itself is very good. It may be a bit contrived to make some of the plot elements work but I'm fine with that. The characters reimagined is what I like. DG (Dorothy) is not a clueless teenager who flounders around in the story seemingly overwhelmed. The tin man used to be lawman (Tin badge, get it?), the lion is actually another species with telepathic powers and the scarecrow was a brilliant adviser to the queen but had half of his brain removed by the evil ruler. Much more believable to me than a group of anthropomorphized beings.

Like I said, I can't see this one becoming an icon of cinematography to last for decades. It drew me into the story enough that I watched all 4 1/2 hours in one sitting just because I couldn't leave it hanging at the end of each episode. And it was worth it to lose a little sleep to see it. I doubt I'll marathon watch it again, but I certainly will watch it again.

The effects and sets are good, and it's obvious the creators meant well. Alan Cumming and Neal McDonough try their damnedest to salvage it but Zooey Deschanel spends the whole thing staring confusedly around and speaking in a vague monotone. If she had one believable expression in the whole thing, it might just be endearing, but as it is, she's Alice wandering vapidly around Wonderland with none of the original's charm. The plot approaches interesting a few times as it meanders along, only to take a hard left into cliche and predictable. It's just a waste of talent.

3288294,5,B0010X744G,Yes this syfy miniseries entertain me. I definitely recommend it. The cars looked like they were from the 1930s and the military vehicles looked like they were from World War II they were. I have seen other movie do similar things. The binding the different areas then add magic gives it a different look and feel. So Yes it did entertain me.,1416096000,,342,4.532258064516129

Actually, i hated the first 23 minutes, I couldn't tolerate another minute. Zooey's performance was forced and amateur. When the 'munchkins' appeared, I was done. Creepy, but not in a good way. I knew I was taking a chance with this one and I lost. I'll never get those 23 minutes back. So disappointed.",1414108800,2,419,4.526315789473684

3288337,4,B0010X744G,Another really good TV to DVD movie. The story line is a refreshing take on The Land of Oz. The only downside is that there are a few parts of the movie where it is dry.,1398124800,,169,3.7222222222222223
3288338,4,B0010X744G,"I suspect this came from the same team that created the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice/dp/B0031DDG9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice</a>&nbsp;mini-series. It has all the same characteristics I liked so much in that one. It honors the original without trying to redefine the characters, or wedge new story into the old plots, or capitalize on the name to suck viewers into an unrelated plot. Instead, it follows a parallel path, brushing closely at times, adamantly its own creature while maintaining respect for the beloved stories and movie that begot it.

Taken by itself, it's a more-than-passable modern kind of fantasy - gritty, noir at times, boiling with unresolved tensions and unexplored strengths that give plenty of room for each character to expand. Visuals are strong, even if they tend to rely on icons more than new imagery, but that's a fair way to get time-bounded story telling up and running. And, there's plenty here to echo today's headlines: harsh interrogation, deep-cover agents, S/M overtones in the Evil Sorceress and her corsetry. But, when you line it up against the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/classic-rendering/dp/B00CNW9ZI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">classic rendering</a>, that's where it really stands out. Old and new at the same time - riffing on the old as a jazz guitarist might, but respecting it.

3288364,5,B0010X744G,I have watched Tin Man 4 times in the last 3 months. It is an excellent production based on The Wizard Of Oz. There is also a bit of Indiana Jones as well. The cast is excellent and features Zooey Deschanel in the starring role. I will definitely add this movie to my collection.,1394323200,,279,4.185185185185185
3288365,4,B0010X744G,It was fun to watch and my daughter loved it.  My daughter has always loved the Wizard of Oz and it was a cool take on the story.,1393459200,2,129,3.607142857142857
3288366,5,B0010X744G,"I love Tin Man.  I watch it over and over -- and it never disappoints.  It's my favorite retelling of the Wizard of Oz story.  This Blu-ray 2 Disc Set has the complete set of extra interviews with the cast as well as a mini-doc about the making of The Mystic Man's cabaret act.  (I particularly enjoyed the interview with Raoul Trujillo who played Raw, the visionary who sees with his heart.)

For fans of the 1939 film Wizard of Oz, there are ""easter eggs"" imbedded throughout Tin Man -- some obvious and some very subtle.  Just spell Ahamo backwards. I dare you. Grin. Sure, Tin Man has flying monkeys -- but they're really scary and fly out of tattoos that adorn the evil witch Azkadellia's cleavage. We're talking scary *cool.*  The scarecrow character, Glitch, is brought to life by Alan Cumming -- whose head sports a snazzy zipper.  The cowardly lion, is the aforementioned Raw,a gentle seer. Toto is there, too, but he's played by the incomparable Blu Mankuma, familiar to sci-fi fans from the New Outer Limits.  But Tin Man is truly carried by Zooey Deschanel as DG and Neal McDonough as Wyatt Cain the Tin Man of the title. DG is a strong female lead that I'd feel comfortable being a role model; and the Tin Man himself is a Good Man.

This OZ -- the outer zone -- is peopled with munchkins, robot nurture units, and a Kind Queen, held prisoner by her daughter. And because it was filmed in beautiful British Columbia, the world of the O Z is truly lovely.  Combine the old and new, and you have this lovely fantasy for the ages. All this and Blu, too!

I cannot give this edition of Tin Man enough stars.  It's delightful.  It's haunting.  And it's one of my favorite miniseries ever.  Get Tin Man and know the wonder of the O Z.  In its own way Tin Man is a classic -- every bit as much as 1939's Wizard of Oz. Enjoy!",1393372800,,1830,4.366863905325443
3288367,5,B0010X744G,"Piggybacking off the Wizard of Oz, this movie delights and entices the imagination about what happens after Dorthy left and challenges your mind with what ifs.  The cinematography and costuming are beautiful and a treat to the eyes.",1392940800,,232,5.105263157894737
3288368,5,B0010X744G,Sy-Fy certainly did a beautiful job re-imagining the Wizard of Oz with this one.  I won't give away too much so that you can enjoy this if you haven't seen it.  But for example tornadoes are like transporters between Earth and Oz and the tin man is a law enforcer.  The whole thing plays out very much like the original Oz.,1392336000,,323,4.262295081967213
3288379,5,B0010X744G,This was an entertaining and very modern twist on the Wizard of OZ.  A good story regardless of the connection to the original story.  We thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie.,1392076800,,176,4.833333333333333

3288403,2,B0010X744G,"Wow this is truly awful. Zooey Deschanel has all the acting range and emotional authority of a sponge. She reacts to being thrown into a unique fantasy world as though she'd seen it all before and it wasn't as good as last years Burning Man. The writing is almost as bad, trite and lame being two words that spring instantly to mind. However the art direction isn't bad, and its relative competance saves the series from being the one star bomb it actually is. It gets five hipster points for continually refering to OZ as ""the Oh Zee"", blech.",1386374400,,543,4.494949494949495

3288424,4,B0010X744G,"To reiterate, the verbal part of the soundtrack contains no subtitles and is difficult to manage for the hearing impaired.  One hears enough to enjoy it  but not enough to follow many parts in detail.
One need fear little or no interference with gratification from the potential memory clash with the classic musical based on the same original. There is no singing to Arlen and Harburg tunes, and no attempt to duplicate the unique qualities of Bert Lahr, Ray Bolger and Jack Haley, much less, Margaret Hamilton (the wicked witch) or Billie Burke (The Good Witch).
Standing on its own, this is an entertaining version of the Frank Baum original, with a less distinguished cast than assayed the parts in the late thirties, but with a different set of expectations (straight acting) than pertained in the earlier work. The cast does a good job in a situation where overacting is invited by the situations played. No doubt to subdue the almost inevitable (with the older audience) temptation to recall the earlier musical score, this one has a strong musical background, often emphasized in scenes.
Unless divided into its component three parts by the listener, there is a tendency toward tedium. More than 90 minutes at a time is a bit overlong. Stick to the episode lengths and I think you will find it more enjoyable.
There is an adequate display of  visual phenomena but not up to the level, BIG pictures today accomplish with the computer based imagery. All in all, I think this will prove good family watching in most homes.",1380672000,4,1527,4.820610687022901
3288425,5,B0010X744G,"In my opinion this is one of the best if not the best TV sci-fi fantasy films of all time.  Superb cast, excel. special effects and very
provocative story lines; in my opinion one of the most imaginative ones.  Terrific casting of Zooey Deschanel  as ""DG"" and a fine supporting  cast
though I wonder if the producers tried to get Zooeys older sister Emily to play her ""evil"" sister.  Perhaps she was tied up with  BONES productions
which started around the same time this film was being made.  I was absolutely enchanted by Zooey who I never heard of before this film.  I generally
do not like actors-actresses very much and have little respect Hollywood (or weird) though I do occasionally take in a movie now and then.  I love
good fantasy and sci fi movies and this one fills the  bill. It was Zooey in this film that eventually led me down the road to BONES TV program which
I fell in love with.  And Emily along with Zooey I think are amoung the two most beautiful women I have ever scene: perfect in every way from glorious blue eyes to brunette hair ( do not like blonds!).  I am still enchanted with them though FOX seems to be paring down the partnership with
Booth a bit, something I do not like.  And I would like to see Zooey make a few more cameo appearances with her sister, playing her sec. cousin.  They both can act as well as sing beautifully.
  But more on the TIN MAN.  I just love the way throughout the film there are subtle and sometimes not subtle references to the great MGM move THE
WIZARD OF OZ, now of course is owned by WARNER BROS.  Some parts of the O.Z. (OUTER ZONE) are not very nice (sort of like New Jersey) and Central
City, the Emerald City of the O.Z., is becoming more like Detroit under the tyranny of the beautiful but nasty Sorceress who also is the sister of
DG.  The TIN MAN gets his name from being a policeman at one time before he gets locked up in a kind of old fashioned diving suit like device.  This tale is a long one, about 4&1/2 hours without commercials but is very enjoyable.  I did not see it on TV until I watched it on my DVD set (I bought
from AMAZON of course!).  I have watched the replays later on TV.  I don't wish to say more for those who might read my little lines of whit, and
have not seen the film, but if you like fun, heroism, feisty (and beautiful) Zooey, good special effects and a happy ending then this is for you.
This is really not a childrens movie but there really isn't anything in it that is offensive either.  Good clean fun!!

3288443,4,B0010X744G,"OK first and foremost the movie is a very good CONTINUATION of the original Wizard of Oz movie. For those of you who have not read the book it is nothing like the movie except the main characters, Dorthy and the Witch.
  Now the main point. THIS IS NOT A REMAKE, UPDATED VERSION or RETELLING of the original story! This movie takes place many many years after the original series (L Frank Baum wrote several). Oz has grown up (as all civilizations do) and it's leadership has failed and it is now under the rule of a new ""bad witch"". Zooey's character is not Dorthy Gail but a descendant and she has no idea of anything Oz related. Yes she is named DG, Oz is called the O.Z. and several other characters are redefined. It is modern and updated.
I cannot understand everyone making comparisons between the ""old and new versions"". Even the Editorial Review gets it wrong!
Please watch this movie on it's own merits and forget the '39 movie. Much like the new movie ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" it is a standalone story that expands the universe of Oz.",1372636800,2,1048,4.453125

Tin Man starts out a little slow but quickly picks up speed as you become enthralled in the mysteries surrounding our characters. I gave it four stars because I really don't feel that Zooey Deschanel gave the best performance...she came off very fake in her acting. But the other actors and story made up for her lack of acting and by the end of the series I found it easy to overlook it.

If you enjoy the land of OZ, you'll enjoy this story.",1366243200,2,648,4.015503875968992
3288485,5,B0010X744G,"I'll start with the fact that this movie was originally a SciFI Channel movie. Best actors:  Alan Cumming for Glitch, Neal McDonough as the titular Tin Man, and the remarkable ""evil"" Azkadelia played by Kathleen Robertson. This is a darker, more believable, and more adult tale of OZ.

While I absolutely love the story telling expertise in this film and most of the acting abilities of the actors in the movie,I will have to say that the actress playing Dorothy Gale was out of her element in this one. The acting was wooden (though she loosened up toward the end) and you can see the rest of the actors attempting to help and support her. However, I would have to say it is the director's fault that the Dorothy ended up stilted rather than tough.

That being said,The acting only detracted a little from the story. It is a tale of struggle between good versus evil. Dorothy starts off as a teen in the corn belt of America, attempting to liven up her dull existence while also trying to figure out the rest of her life.

Suddenly, everything she thought she knew about her ""parents"" and herself gets turned upside down when a twister arrives bearing unwanted guests. Assassins bent on killing Dorothy invade their home. In an attempt to save Dorothy she is shoved into the tornado.

Of course the result is she is dumped into the land of OZ. Here is where the acting becomes somewhat wooden. Perhaps she was trying to portray shock and dismay.

Dorothy ends up captured my ""munchkin"" types who put her in a cage dangled high in the trees where they are hiding from the Witch's men. She meet the Glitch who literally had part of his brain removed by the witch and a zipper placed in his head. Every so often his mind glitches while trying to remember some thing important that is in the other part of his brain, thus the nickname. Later it turns out he was the court adviser to the Queen and a very gifted inventor. Neal McDonough does a great job with this (he  has had other really great roles after this one, like that of Loki in the last Avengers creation) and is quite believable.

They escape when the witch's men  invade the little gathering and they take off down the road and come across the ""Tin Man"". He is locked in a tin suit (similar to an old fashioned diving suit with the big helmet) and forced to watch the execution of his wife by the witch's men over and over. Dorothy finds out that he was a policeman for the Queen in the Emerald city and was called Tin Man for the badge he wore. The actor does a great, believable job being the tough silent type and eventually warms up to the other characters.

Toto turns out to me a shapeshifter who used to teach Dorothy and her sister Azkadelia (who is actually the witch causing the havoc in the kingdom) magic and he shape shifts into a scottie terrier.  His loyalty is suspect during most of the movie and adds much suspense.

Well, I don't want to spoil everything for you as there are many more surprises in store for the watcher and much more to the story. Suffice it to say that my grandchildren will see this in a few more years, but it is definitely going into my favorites.",1366070400,,3147,4.416234887737478

This isn't for the younger kids.  I would recommend this for hardy 10-12 year olds, or anyone over 13 who is okay with scary parts.  The wicked witch is still very, very wicked (and manipulative).  She just got uglier!  The flying monkeys are uglier.  A new creature is introduced called the ""Pa'pae"" (I know I'm not spelling that right), that aren't exactly pretty.

3288531,4,B0010X744G,"Several years ago, the SyFy channel decided to take a crack at re-inventing the classic Wizard of Oz, a noble task, that many have tried and failed. I didn't know what to expect, but I assumed it would be some variation of the classic tale, hoping it would be more the like books and less like the films. Tin Man is defiantly not for kids and takes a unique approach to the classic story. In this version, OZ is not the friendly loveable place with strange characters and happy times for all. It's a dark story, about a dark place, where presently there is a lot of pain and misery. The big twist in the story is that this OZ is centuries past the one visited by Dorothy Gale. In the Outer Zone (O.Z.), Dorothy Gale is a revered as the start of the royal families bloodline, but she has been dead for centuries! That being said, quite ingeniously, the future residents of the O.Z. parallel the old story, but not because they have to, they are in a sense mocking the original story in subtle ways. There's D.G. (Zooey Deschanel), the girl from the other side, who was forced into the O.Z., with no memory of ever having been there before. She soon meets Glitch, (Alan Cummings) a man who had part of his brain removed for disobeying the Queen. As they try to figure out what is happening around them, they run into a man (Neal McDonough) being punished in a Tin Man suit. This man was a Cop or Tin Man in the O.Z. who was deemed a threat, and put into this horrible form of torture. Finally, they come to the rescue of a native healer, named Raw (Raoul Trujillo), who has become trapped by carnivores and is about to become dinner. Together they go to see the wise man, to find out how to proceed in helping D.G. The Wise Man (Richard Dreyfuss) turns out to be a drugged out magician doing parlor tricks! There are a million other parallels to the original story that make the journey through the O.Z. that much more enjoyable. Zooey Deschanel is the star and even though people often mistake her unique style of acting for inexperience, she was the perfect choice to play D.G. The other standout is veteran character actor, Neal McDonough, who gives a gut wrenching and strong performance as the tortured former cop, in search of his family. The rest of the supporting cast was equally as impressive, taking you through the full range of emotions. As I said before, this is certainly not the OZ you grew up with and it's certainly not what I expected. Everything from the special effects, to the story, and even the modernization, was extremely impressive. It really is a shame that this was only a three part mini-series, but this would have made for one hell of a regular series. Some of the parallels are obvious, but there were plenty of times where I legitimately forgot that I was watching The Wizard of Oz. Leave the musical for the kid, this is what Frank Baum had in mind when he started this series, and it's most defiantly meant for mature audiences only.",1361491200,3,2967,4.455882352941177

Now I have that VHS still, it's been watched so often by me and the rest of my family that we were getting audio problems and the tape would skip.

I tried to find this in the stores near by but no one seemed to have it, I'm not sure why but they didn't. So I came here and I found this.

We got it quickly and we watched it as soon as I opened it. There were no problems at all, and I like the fact that we now have it on dvd because I can't watch VHS's in my room anymore(My old player got it self fried....not sure how...) So now I can watch this when I want to without bothering anyone else.",1351036800,,739,3.670886075949367
3288579,1,B0010X744G,"I can't believe I watched the whole thing!

I should have turned this off after D.G. arrives in O.Z. and meets a zipperhead, a person who has had their brains removed, and yet still is able to walk and talk and interact with people.  By the end of the mini-series, I was convinced the scriptwriter was a zipperhead.

Aside from the zipperhead character, which should be more than enough to tell you the kind of thinking that went into writing this alternate universe story, there was the oddest collection of primitive technology, steampunk technology, superscience and magic all mixed together in a random fashion.

People drove cars that looked like they were new during the 1930s and the military drove what looked World War II military vehicles.  The military reminded me of World War II German soldiers.

There were iron maiden style suits you could lock people in for years that provided all the nourishment that anyone would need to survive.  I wasn't sure if that was supposed to be science or magic.  The one person we meet who has been imprisoned for years (very long hair and beard) is able to walk out without the expected atrophied muscles I would have expected under the circumstances.

There were holographic projectors that displayed images in broad daylight that were real enough to confuse onlookers into thinking they were the real thing.  Was this science or magic?

There were robots that were so lifelike that D.G. never knew that her (foster) parents were actually robots.  Nobody living in contemporary Earth knew they were robots either.  Pretty impressive technology.  Although when the robot parents returned to their hometown, they were met with a very steampunk cyborg.

An evil witch, who manages to be imprisoned without a body for 500 years is helped by D.G. to escape her prison and take of the body of her older sister, Azkadellia.  Shortly thereafter Azkadellia kills D.G.  Their mom brings D.G. back to life but loses all her magical ability in the process.  All her magic has been transferred into D.G.

Then there is the evil witch sister, Azkadellia.  She is able to teleport, keeps flying monkeys stored on her chest as tattoos and sucks souls out of people that displease her.  When she is not using a teleporting spell to visit her imprisoned mom, she uses horses rather than cars for transportation.  Did I mention yet that they have the ability to move between (teleport?) Earth and O.Z.?

The evil witch has built a machine, that wouldn't be out of place in a World War II epic, which is supposed to be the power plant for some kind of laser to be used to end the world.

Whenever the evil people use their streampunk technology (mind control devices, prison doors, brain in a jar computer with the adding machine interface) the controls never look like they could possibly be functional.

Are you with me so far?

There are plenty of other examples of why having a brain makes this a difficult mini-series to watch.  Instead I will go to the stake in the heart of this story.  The moment when I had to ask myself, how could I have wasted that much time watching this came near the end when D.G. talks Azkadellia into fighting the influence of the 500 year old witch that inhabits her body.  This is the 500 year old witch who has killed D.G. once already, the 500 year old witch who eats the souls of people that bother her, the 500 year old witch who enslaved the whole land, the 500 year old witch who personally killed or ordered killed many people, the 500 year old witch who imprisoned many people (a massive prison is featured in a couple of scenes), the 500 year old witch who enlisted an army to do her evil bidding, the 500 year old witch who had enslaved Azkadellia for years, after all that, all it took for Azkadellia, to fight off the evil witch was D.G. saying please fight.  Even better, when did this fight happen?  Not when the evil witch is tired or recovering from exerting herself.  No, this takes place with the evil witch at the height of her powers after she managed to gain possession of the all powerful green gem.

I'm sorry, but as bad and as dumb as the mini-series was up to this point, the ending is so over the top bad and so unbelievable that I had to write this negative review.",1344988800,8,4257,4.603448275862069

3288583,1,B0010X744G,"What a sad, over-the-top apeing of so many film cliches and so typical of American nastiness, violence- ""death rays', flame-throwers -and guns-of course. The poor director thinks it's a deep, pyschological story but it is just bizarre, infantile and unoriginal with nearly each frame trying to be more hyperbolic than the previous. Before purchase an indication of level of mentality of this film would have been honest.

Devices? Using ""double-location"",why does the wicked sister translocate to the mother on the island but then spend just-behind pony chases through the forest? There is Aristotelian transmigratiom man/dog/ dog/ man/ dog and Hansel and Gretel magic buttons to mark the trail. A ""Round the World in 80 Days"" balloon; ""Star Wars"" redwoods and Ewoks (with painted faces and feathers) and  tree walks; a hat and coat from Ark Raiders and jumping into the gorge from Butch Cassidy and his sun dancing friend, ""beam me up"" to the moon ""Scotty"" - and so on.

The totally wooden, unimaginative ""action doll"" Dorothy (poor, actual actress Garland supposedly inspiring this!) can suddenly use her face muscles in the last scene. Was botox used along with the drops to over-bulge her ""expressive"" eyes. At least the out-of-focus camera work early in the film  -to be ""spooky""? was abandoned for clear, good light filming in the 3rd series.

3288586,5,B0010X744G,"This was a fantastic film, with enough affectionate references to the ""original"" Wizard of Oz that it bordered on being homage, but far darker and edgier than the 1939 classic ever dreamed of being. The visual effects are wonderful, as are the characterizations and most of the acting (sorry, but I just didn't care for Deschanel, who displayed two facial expressions throughout the whole thing). The rest of the movie made up for her, though, and was a thoroughly enjoyable romp down the yellow brick road.

There was a element of sadness for me, though. I suppose I'm nostalgic for what I remember as a brighter, more cheerful past. In today's world, anything as light-hearted, sweet, and joyful as the original (flying monkeys notwithstanding) wouldn't have a chance. Like the residents of OZ, it's as if we're living in a post apocalyptic world, full of fears and hate and dangers. That there is hope at the end of the road (the yellow brick one, of course) is my only consolation. I just wish today's young people could be treated to films that aren't always dark and edgy.

Do not expect a remake, or even a modernisation of the classic. Tin Man is inspired by the Wizard of Oz but is virtually a brand new story with just enough referances to pay homage to the original, this though is not a bad thing. this is a very original story with some very intriguing plots and twists.
Zooey Deschanel is brilliant as D.G an outsider to the Outer Zone but clearly on a path of destiny, a path that reminds her of forgotten memorys. Zooey does well carrying the story and the other charactors, her big blue eyes and her on screen presence is the glue that holds the story together
This is a Sci fi channel original and is very much belongs in the sci fi genre, but also has elements of Lord of the Rings.
This is a story of adventure, friendship, good, evil, and a story of sisters and family.
It is hard to write a review without giving to much away.
Fans of the original Wizard of Oz will enjoy as long as they keep an open mind with an understanding that this is an original story, otherwise they will feel dissapointed.

3288619,4,B0010X744G,"Sadly, the german DVD is edited down to just 86 minutes so I ordered this Blu-Ray and hey... its a very interesting Version and return to Oz.

Not only Neal McDonough (""Desperate Housewives""), Zooey Deschanel, Kathleen Robertson (Claire in ""Beverly Hills 90210"") and Alan Cumming and Richard Dreyfuss are interesting actors, also Ted Whittall (""Smallville"" as Rick Flag)as Ahamo (return spelled Omaha), Dan Payne (also once guest in ""Smallville"") who play the longcoat leader , Craig Veroni (""Stargate Atlantis"" in Season 1) have a nice appearances.

Those longcoats troups remember me somehow to Gestappo in the WW2. Hm.. for some fetish fans could be any scenes interesting (Leather/Rubber Uniforms/Clothes).

Very nice are the trivias / references to the original 1939 THE WIZARD OF OZ Movie:

The Housenumber where D.G. (for Dorothy Gale) is living has the number 39. It can been seen in a scene before the storm is beginning. Its a reference to the year of 1939.

During the dream sequence, DG is asked if she's been having dreams again, and she says, ""Yeah, in Technicolor."" ""TEchnicolor"" was the camera process who gave the 1939 movie the wonderful color.

The officer who's giving D.G. on the beginning of the movie a ticket for her driving has the name Gulch. A reference to Miss Gulch.

Near on the beginning of part 2, DG calls her father ""Popsicle"". In the ""Wicked"" stage version its also mentioned but by Glinda the Good Witch.

My mind: the Mini-Serie is very nice and interesting. The special effects are sometime not quite perfect and looks cheap (any creatures!). Others looks very good.

The picture quality is good. The soundtrack is english and contains english subtitles (which I need sometime as help).

Also very nice - the bonus-features have a lenght of approx. 155 minutes and are interesting (Interviews, behind-the-scenes documentaries).

FAZIT: Of course, its quite different from the 1939 movie which was very magic and beautiful. No other new movie/remake will get his ""magic"". Don't try to compare it. Zooey Deschanel is not Judy Garland, Neal McDonough is not THE Tin Man like Ray Bolger it was. Also Richard Dreyfuss is not Frank Morgan was as the Wizard etc.

This version has his own charme.",1326153600,3,2227,4.989189189189189
3288620,2,B0010X744G,"I WANTED this to be good - the concept is great; a gritty, violent, dark retelling of the Wizard of Oz. The budget was not small - the CGI effects are better than most TV series (way better than Primeval, maybe on par or slightly better than Supernatural) and the sets, costumes, and a few moderate to big name actors (Richard Dryfus), the camera work is great and has some cool, interesting, and at times unconventional cinematography. The GLARING flaw is the poorly written dialog and whoever directed the actors didn't have a clue what he wanted - nor a very good eye for yelling ""cut"" when a line isn't delivered and everyone stands around for a few seconds in uncomfortable silence while the actor is reminded of the line (which audio guys took out in post).

More than anything, I'm baffled as to why the lead playing DG (Zooey Deschanel) - the Dorothy equivalent - would be cast in ANYTHING but bit parts. Shes HORRIBLE!!! No emotion in her face or voice, she slurs lines, says words wrong, shes stiff and robotic, and in general - at this moment in her career anyhow  - she has no right to be called ""actress"" - she doesn't act. I think 100% of those uncomfortable silences were brought waiting for her to say a line. How did Zooey get past the demo reel review stage? Shes cute - she looks the part - and that's where it ends. She must have known somebody important or had some serious clout with the director to be kept on here. No director handed a budget this big would keep someone as incapable as this on as lead for more than a week of rehearsals. I'm sure this hurt his career something fierce. UNLESS - Zooey was directed to be like this - in which case the director should be or should have been blacklisted. Any way you cut it, its tremendously jarring and sad. Kathleen Robertson was also lacking, but not as significantly. Surprisingly, Alan Cummings - normally a fun and natural actor - delivered his lines with a sense of ease but feels totally out of place and lacking rhythm with his lines. His role comes across like hes not sure what to do half the time. Maybe the director is to blame for all this - i dunno. I just wanted it to be so much better.

I guess this had so much promise that I'm downright angry at it being ruined by a crap director or a few apathetic actors/actresses cast in the headlining roles -  whichever is the case. I know I'm being harsh, but I'm also being honest. The director may be to blame - but its clear Zooey want ready for this role no matter how you look at it. Its like shes super stoned in every scene, and looks lost amongst a sea of capable actors. My opinion anyhow.

Not everyone is a train wreck though - props to the saving grace talents; Callum Keith Rennie (always a pleasure to watch), Richard Dreyfuss of course, Neal McDonough (always stable, consistent - a solid actor, especially in hard-edged roles like this). Two stars for everything done right - no love on the other two and a half stars due to the brick wall of awfulness that won't let me see past the lead characters to enjoy the rest. Yes shes that bad. I would've given this 4 1/2 stars if I couldn't believed in her character for even half the time - she didn't sell it and didn't even seem to try.",1325808000,3,3232,4.353233830845771

3288626,5,B0010X744G,Very good story. Well made movie. Long but perfect to get the story told. Zooey was good in this part.,1323648000,,102,4.15
3288627,4,B0010X744G,"Critics have written about how this production is kind of a mess, and they're right.  The story is languid far too often, it feels like it could have lost an hour at least, there are all kinds of characters introduced and never seen or referenced again, they travel to all kinds of places they don't really need to, it's obvious how much the production is trying to mimic Lord of the Rings, Zooey Deschanel is great to look at on screen but much of the time it feels like she's playing herself rather than a character (or that she's high).  And after all of that, it has this incredibly abrupt and (for me, anyway) unsatisfying ending.

That said, I still enjoyed watching this.  Some critics have written that the multiple references to the Baum original or the movie were too obvious or corny, but I enjoyed catching all the references amid the sometimes very dark story.  I also liked the steampunk aesthetic.  And most of the people involved make a valiant effort: the special effects are fine for TV; the sets and costumes all look great; the little girls do a fine acting job in the flashbacks (sometimes I felt like I'd rather watch a whole show about them); Dreyfuss is obviously slumming (he must have needed some quick cash) but is enjoyable to watch, even just for the ""what is he doing in this?"" factor; Cumming is not great but perfectly fine, though I never quite got what his character was about; Kathleen Robertson as the villain seems to be enjoying herself the most out of the main cast (apart from Dreyfuss), though what the intention of her character's final plan was remains a mystery to me (it seemed like she already ruled over everything, so why did she need to make the O.Z. dark - just for the metaphorical value?); Callum Keith Rennie is great as Zero, and shows some real terror in his 'torture' scene, though his character is a fairly one-dimensional bad guy.

Just like Lord of the Rings, I found the first installment to be the strongest.  The ending is certainly worthwhile just to see the resolution of the story, but like most stories, the part where everything is set up and the characters and their ultimate purposes are introduced tends to be the most interesting.  There seems to be a very good balance between realism and adventurism in the first part that is lost in the second two.  When they jump off the cliff, it's a great moment that reminds you you're watching a fantasy adventure.  By the time the story gets to electrocution and torture and characters weeping over graves, it's good dramatic stuff but the balance between the serious and the fantastical that I thought really made the first part just vaporizes.

I personally thought the ending was too abrupt, and I would have liked even just one shot of the future of the O.Z. with D.G. and her sister in their rightful places and with Ambrose advising and the Tin Man doing whatever he would do and so on.  Just a ten-second shot right before the closing credits would have been sufficient.  Maybe someone thought that a sequel was possible so they ended it like that, but there was a lot of material they could have lost to make room for a little glimpse into the O.Z.'s future.

When Deschanel's character finally figures out who she is and remembers all the history she's a part of and what really happened to her sister, it's a very good dramatic moment which reveals a depth to the script that almost makes up for all the flaws in the production.  There are a few moments like that where this story succeeds, so keep them in mind when you're sitting through the parts that don't.",1323302400,2,3585,4.578125

3288638,2,B0010X744G,"The story is an interesting derivative- I won't say adaptation, because it isn't even remotely like the original LF Baum books. That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but as it stands I cannot recommend it. The story is predictable and poorly written. The director doesn't utilize the strengths of the actors, who have the potential to be good. Overacting seems to be encouraged. Some acting is better than others, but subtlety is totally nonexistent in any of the characters. Was this written for children? Not sure who the audience is supposed to be, but sure wasn't written for me.

The production design was pretty good. The makeup was horrid. Being a fan of the LF Baum books, I wish that someone would do a series that was as scary and dark as the original books. Even adapted, the LF Baum books would be amazing with the right director, writers, production design and actors.",1322265600,2,885,4.746753246753247
3288639,2,B0010X744G,"So, I clicked this show because I'd seen SyFy's ""Alice"" - which I really liked by the way - but this is no ""Alice"".  It has promise, some of the characters are endearing - ok, maybe only Glitch - the idea tries to be fresh, some of the adaptations are fun and clever, and the special effects aren't bad considering it's age.  However, the acting can be painful, the plot is very slow and confusing, and the music and sound effects are often louder than the dialog and not what I would term great.

DG (Dorothy) is...not great...she runs oddly, has a tendency to seem rather whiny, and her motivations seem lacking.  The Tin Man was a great idea, but his acting isn't great and he seems rather stereotyped.  Raw bears little or no resemblance to the Cowardly Lion and his character is very undeveloped.  Glitch - the Scarecrow - is probably the best, his acting is good and he's funny.

However, the characters weren't my biggest complaint - don't get me wrong, I have complaints, but they weren't the worst part. The worst part is not even the poor acting, but rather the fact that this could've been great, but it just ended up forgettable. Many of the adaptations of characters and ideas from ""The Wizard of Oz"" were good, but so often they just ended up weird or confusing or incomplete.  The first episode was the best (but it did drag quite a lot) after that I just felt like I needed to finish the series for the sake of finishing it.

I would say that if you were looking for a new perspective on ""The Wizard of Oz"" or if you had some time to spare, watch it.

This isn't the most original story - it can't be, right?  It's based on The Wizard of Oz.  However, the integrating of new ideas with references to the original story makes it something quite enjoyable.

Sci-Fi/Sy-Fy is really good at making cheesy movies, and this isn't the cheesiest.

As to the actual movie itself.  It has interesting characters who grow and develop over time The outdoor sets that are amazing, and the indoor sets that are quite impressive. It is a made for TV series and some of the green-screen and CGI work is glaringly obvious, but it's the story is strong enough to cary over those moments.

Now about the cast. Most of the time they range from solid to excellent. But DG and Azkadellia have a similar approach to life. I can actually see this from two points of view.
First  I don't know if the producers were trying to hit the ""strong silent type"", or if someone took to much prozac, but in some very high stress situations they respond with a attitude that channels every 13 year old eye rolling ""yeah, What-ever!"". It does not mater that certain death is in front of them, or they just suffered a major emotional trauma, they become stoic.
Second, it may actually make sense. At one point DG says: ""Well, I guess this is not a dream."" and that makes a lot of sense. If you where asleep one minute, and the next you where running from nazi SS troops in leather coats, and hanging in a bird cage while tiny little blue and red painted elf warriors discussed torturing you while a dude with a zipper in his head watches you from the ceiling I think a certain amount of detached ""wow, no more chili fries before bed"" attitude is appropriate. I mean who believes something like that could actually happen? And with all that hits DG over the course of 6 days about her parents, her extended family, and her life who can blame her for becoming a bit blase about new emotional drama.

Made for TV, it shows - very poor CG (screams Sci Fi original) and just worse than mediocre acting it relies heavily on the story which can be repetitious given the delivery format.  As a Blu Ray I was not impressed.  We originally watched the show on DVDs from Netflix and there's little in the way of a discernible difference to a non audio/videophile.  So why did I buy it?  We really enjoy the story, the fantasy is fun even if poorly delivered.  And when I bought it, it was a single digit price for the Blu Ray, cheaper than the DVD copy.

Set several generations after the original OZ tale, this is the story of Dorothy Gale's great granddaughter who has to fight against her possessed sister to save OZ. For those who are fans of the original story, look for details cleverly interwoven into or scattered throughout the story that echo the original tale in some way. There are many and each time I watch it, I catch more. Brilliantly done.  The Tin Man was played very powerfully by Neal McDonough - he almost steals the show, for those with a heart. Zooey Claire Deschanel is just wonderful as DG; while her acting is considered deadpan by some, her face is so expressive - I know people in real life just like DG's character. Kathleen Robertson is delicious as the evil Azkadellia. In fact, most of the actors are well suited for their characters. For me, the only exception is the guy who plays DG's real dad. He was OK, and may be a fine actor, I just didn't think he was best person for this particular role. But the rest - great. Oh, and the soundtrack - while not a musical like the original OZ movie, the soundtrack is well done. Anyway, one of the too few times that SyFy channel lives up to its motto of ""Imagine Greater.""

3288700,4,B0010X744G,"...it's hard to put my finger on what exactly is missing in the chemistry of this series, but perhaps it lies in the inability of the director to decide who the main audience is.

In any case, I'm glad that I saw this re-telling of Baum's ""The Wizard of Oz.""  Tin Man's OZ is not the largely sweetness and light Oz of the 1929 version's fame.  This Oz is ""The O.Z"" (O.Z. = ""outer zone"").  This is the O.Z. of a cruel princess/witch who wishes to plunge the O.Z. into perpetual darkness and rule with an iron fist forever.

D.G. is a post-HS aged young-woman who lives on a sleepy farm somewhere in the midwest.  She has recurring dreams about a far away place, and she renders those dreams into drawings and paintings. She works as a waitress in a dreary diner, and knows that she was meant for something more.  That something more, at least in her mind, never included the Outer Zone...which of course, she enters.

The acting is strong at times, weak at others, but entertaining throughout.

I enjoyed the different slant that the writers took in this post-Wizard of Oz and emerald city view of the Outer Zone.  There are Gestapo-like ""long-coats"", evil scientists in the employ of the princess, an Outer Zone resistance movement, and D.G. gets dumped into the middle of this.

All in all a good made-for-TV mini-series hosted by the Sci-Fi Network.  I liked the cast, the story's premis, and what the director did with it, for the most part.

However, after watching it, I was only mildly impressed.  It was entertaining and I liked a lot of the twists, but a lot of it felt cheesy and rushed.  For example, I really loved the new take on the Tin Man.  He was a real man, not some empty tin suit... who had actually been trapped in some kind of metal man shaped torture chamber.  Inside this metal suit he was forced to re-live the most horrible moment of his life over and over and over again for years... until DG saves him.  On the other hand... I did not like the new modern interpretation of the scarecrow.  I felt that Glitch's character... was really just kinda stupid.  With a zipper down the center of his head to show he was missing half his brain, and how he keeps forgetting things...  I though this character could have been developed better.

3288718,3,B0010X744G,"I agree with the other reviewer who said this falls short of the original intent to make this an adult version of the classic children's movie. The acting is sub-par all the way through, except maybe Richard Dreifuss' Mystic, and the comical Glitch. The others are carboard characters with no complexity at all. The production is surprizingly good for a TV series, but the attempt to fuse the different genres is pretty cheesy. We have heroic quest fantasy a la Lord Of The Rings, a fairy tale (Alice in Wonderland), distopian science fiction story (Brave New World), post-apocalyptic action-adventure (Waterworld, Mad Max). Many scenes and characters are out of place, like the entire ""Resistance"" army. They cannot resist anything at all - the witch and her army are too powerful. The witch's army and Gestapo-like secret police is pretty redundant as well - isn't a witch supposed to have magic to do all that for her? The WW2 machines especially seemed ridiculous. Also the whole Dune scene in front of the Witches Castle (which itself is like the Dark Tower in Two Towers) seemed highly unoriginal.

That said, I still like the way the plot gradually unfolds to reveal more about the heroine and the villain, and the way they are intimately connected. And there are some interesting scenes involving magic, such as the demon-like dark witch possessing Askadelia, and her eventual exorcism at the end.

On the whole this is a highly derrivative, un-original work, albeit a very entertaining one.",1280448000,4,1499,4.968127490039841
3288719,4,B0010X744G,"""Tin Man"", a 3 part mini-series that aired on the Sci-Fi channel in 2007, is a re-imagining of the Wizard of Oz.  But unlike the classic 1939 movie, which despite its overtones of evil, was basically a bright and cheerful place, ""Tin Man"" is much darker and apocalyptic (and in a sense, truer to the novel by L. Frank Baum.)

The story follows D.G., a young woman in Kansas who lives at home on a farm, working as a waitress in a local diner, and yearning for a more exciting life, one where she better fits in.  Without giving anything away, she is transported to the O.Z. (the Outer Zone) and meets up with updated versions of the tin man, cowardly lion, and scarecrow, who help her on her quests.  However, while giving the occasional nod to the 1939 film, the story and characters in ""Tin Man"" are basically brand new, and are entertaining and imaginative.

For a miniseries, the special effects are quite good and very realistic.  The actors are, by and large, talented and fit well into their characters, especially Alan Cumming as Glitch (the scarecrow), and Neal McDonough as the Tin Man.  I had some problems with Zooey Deschanel's portrayal of DG, though.  While Ms Deschanel is extremely talented, I felt that the scope of her character's emotions was too limited and too bland, when greater passion and amazement would have been more appropriate.

While I enjoyed the story as a whole, I also thought some of the dialog was a bit too stilted and/or trite at times, and that there were several holes in the plot that could have been better explained.  Again, without trying to give anything away, the evil witch has her purpose, but it's never really clear why she wants to do it, especially as the likely impact would be the end of the world.  The first two episodes were better in this regard, while the third (and final episode) felt a bit rushed.  I also would have liked a slightly longer and more conclusive ending after DG and company defeat the witch.

Taken as a whole, though, this is a good miniseries.  It runs to about 4  hours of actual viewing time, and is well worth watching.  I liked how they turned the story of the Wizard of Oz inside out, along with the superior productions values, and how well the actors fit their roles.",1280361600,4,2255,4.558312655086849
3288720,5,B0010X744G,"WE ALL KNOW the Tin Man is the guy looking for a heart. But in the three-part series broadcast on SyFy (formerly SciFi), we have ""...a team of characters missing parts who, as a group, complete each other,"" as Raoul Trujillo (Raw/Cowardly Lion) says in the making-of.

Sounds a lot like the original, yes? Still, the overriding quest in this new take - from the Wicked Witch, Azkadellia (Kathleen Robertson) to D.G./Dorothy Gale (Zooey Deschanel) herself - the theme is finding heart as in love and courage.

In a clever script from Steven Long Mitchell and Craig W. Van Sickle directed by Nick Willing, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" both book and film, have been filtered through a rusty steam punk lens for an exciting sci-fi twist. Gadgets made up of ancient office machines and what looks like Dr. Frankenstein's original set define the O.Z. or Outer Zone. The Scarecrow is now Glitch (Alan Cumming), once the most intelligent man in the universe, now a zipper-headed goofball in search of his missing brain. (Find it bottled in Dr. Frank's lab in  the W.W.'s industrialized castle.)

D.G. - Dorothy - wears bootcut jeans and rides a motorcycle in old Kansas where she works as a waitress in a blue gingham apron. (Who wouldn't want leave that behind?) ToTo is a shape shifter. The Cowardly Lion - or Raw - has leonine characteristics and is a member of an empathic race, captured and used by the W.W. in order to glean secrets from her enemies.

The Tin Man/Wyatt Cain (Neal McDonough) is an Old West style law enforcer complete with cool hat and six gun. He also rides a white horse. When introduced, Cain is found in a gruesome metal diving suit contraption, a device that continually replays the most horrific day of sustaining him physically. His heart is hardened by grief while the others are shattered, yet they band together to fight the evil that has overtaken the O.Z.

That would be the gorgeous Wicked Witch who dresses in extreme, body sculpting style - golden body armour, leather, satin  - and whose flying bat monkeys come to life through tattoos inscribed on her cleavage.

Visually, ""Tin Man"" is a treat with all its imaginative characters, costumes and sets. Effects are not always the best. Those flying monkeys, for example, are sometimes painfully rendered. Some efforts, such as the green house and double eclipse, look amateurish. However, it all blends in well with the story; color and detail are movie quality, especially in high-def. A stereo soundtrack sounds good; viewers will enjoy re-watching and listening for classic Oz references. An original score by Simon Boswell has a lush, almost classic sound.

Extras are carried over from the DVD collector's edition and make lively viewing once the series concludes. The best would be ""Beyond the Yellow Brick Road: The Making of Tin Man,"" a detailed behind-scenes exploration with interviews from cast and crew. This is a film adults can enjoy on their own or together with young ones. It might even make a decent, two-night double feature with the classic ""Wizard of Oz"" - or pair it with Nick Willing's most recent SyFy homage, ""Alice,"" a reboot of ""Alice in Wonderland.""",1279843200,2,3147,4.845437616387337

3288727,4,B0010X744G,"Tin Man is a miniseries that was shown on the Sci-Fi channel and which came out in December of 2007. It stars Zooey Deschanel (as D.G.), Neal McDonough (as Cain, the Tin Man), Alan Cumming (as Glitch, the Scarecrow) and Raoul Trujillo (as Raw, the Lion).  It is based upon the Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum but adds a lot of fantasy and science fiction and takes many, many liberties.  The characters are based on Wizard of Oz characters and the land is the O.Z. (Outer Zone).

At the beginning of the series, we meet DG, a teenage waitress in Kansas that is tiring of her life there, feels that there is something that makes her different from the people that she works and lives with (even though she can't put her finger on exactly what) and is haunted by dreams of a woman with lavender eyes telling her that a storm is brewing. And a storm does come - Azkadellia (played by Kathleen Robertson), aka the Wicked Witch - sends a troop of her long coat policemen to kidnap DG and bring her back to the O.Z. DG escapes by jumping into the travel storm that brought the longcoats to Kansas and meets, in short order, Wyatt Cain, Glitch and Raw in the O.Z. The troop learns that Azkadellia is searching for an emerald with which to permanently cause the O.Z. to become dark and that D.G. inherited that knowledge when DG's mother revived her after Azkadellia killed DG using dark magic. Therefore, DG is the key to Azkadellia's success. The group then begins a search to find the Mystic Man (played by Richard Dreyfuss) in the hopes of stopping Azkadellia from ruining the Outer Zone.

I had high hopes for this movie/mini-series. The concept was very promising - an updated, edgier version of the saccharine movie and children's book that we all know. And in some ways it delivered, but in some ways it did not.  I really liked Zooey Deschanel - she totally redefined Dorothy and was just fun.  McDonough was appropriately cast as the Tin Man, as was Alan Cumming as the Scarecrow. I didn't like the Tin Man though at all, the character was just too two dimensional. He was driven too much by cynicism. The story was an interesting re-telling of the previous version and I thought it was pretty creative.",1272844800,2,2203,4.508771929824562

Even the Wiz was created to show off all of Michael's well known capabilities with similarities that followed the ""Wizard of Oz"" to some degree.

But the Tin Man fantasy series is completely mind blowing, and I almost missed seeing it when Sci-Fi channel offered it, not knowing that it would take me into the original author's incredible mind. He created a story with all the elements of fear, love, humor, hate and finally reconciliation. IT IS the Wizard of Oz as it should be read or seen. It's worth it many times over.

(which I assumed was Dorothy Gale) and there are characters who are obviously supposed to parallel the original characters. But never fear the show does address the parallel between the two, with an ah-hah moment near the end.

I never liked the original Wizard of Oz and the first time I watched this I watched with trepidation, however I was pleasantly surprised to like this version. One thing to keep in mind is that this show is very long, but put into several part for the ease of showing on television. I find that this can be either helpful or annoying depending on how you deal with sitting and watching a show for long periods of time. The first two parts are on the first DVD and the rest is on the second along with bonus features. I consider this one of the downsides, because who wants to change DVDs in the middle of a show.

The two sisters Dee-Gee (for Dorothy Gale) and Azkadellia, both are attractive antagonists, but the problem with the entire plot is that the wicked Azkadellia's chief goal throughout this entire story is to just blow up the Outer Zone (OZ). That's it, nothing more, except that she has many, many people with homes and families who are assisting her in this.

My thought was: Why????

It would be one thing is she wanted the same old power and gain routine that bad people want, but no, she wants to vaporize the entire zone. And it doesn't make sense. And if this is so science fiction, why do we need witches, anyway? Sci-Fi should not interject itself into fantasy and vice versa. Yet here were have technical wonders being admired by a magic-casting sorceress. And why would her evil minions support her in the destruction of OZ? What do THEY get out of it?

This is more like Hellboy Meets the Wizard, only there's not Hellboy to keep things at least a little interesting. Still, you may like it. I liked it enough to watch it, but afterwards thought of a number of deficiencies that just rubbed me the wrong way.",1262649600,5,1392,4.578313253012048

3288774,2,B0010X744G,"I really wanted to like this series.  I love the cast, and I love both the books and movie of The Wizard of Oz.  But Tin Man was a disappointment in almost every respect.  The acting, even by those who've been good in other movies, was spotty.  No one except Richard Dreyfuss turned in a solid performance throughout.  The story was a taped-together hash of Star Wars, Dark City, Star Trek, and a dozen better shows.  Even the theme music (repeated endlessly and overbearingly) sounded like Harry Potter.

The whole thing seemed listless.  The actors didn't seem to be putting much into it, the pace was slow and uneven, and most of the design & art direction was uninspired.  It's completely mediocre, and riding on the coattails of Oz seemed like an act of desperation.  It did not earn its link to the Oz books/movies in any way.  The connection was arbitrary and pointless, though the only modicum of fun was spotting the old familiar faces (Oh!  There's Toto!  Hey, there's the wizard!).  But it seemed unsure what connection, if any, existed in its universe between events in The Wizard of Oz and events in Tin Man.  Most of the time the links were random, and when it did try to make a real connection it didn't make much sense.  On its own merits, as a fantasy adventure, it has nothing interesting to say or show.  Casting itself in the tradition of Oz doesn't help much.  There are some good laughs, and the evil witch is inspired and frightening, but otherwise this is a slow and unmemorable series.",1259366400,6,1510,4.57089552238806

A lot of potential in the premise (or rather multiple premises), but ruined by piss-poor direction -- that's the only explanation for the fact that EVERY actor in this woebegotten teleplay seemed to be reading their lines under the influence of a narcotic.  Or under the influence of formaldehyde.

And the lines they should've been putting some, er, acting, into were also dreadful -- some good ideas here (actually, too many... it would take an encyclopedia to map out the stolen ""homages"" to various genres) but terrible, terrible writing.

For a low budget, though, the sets, special effects imagery and photography were quite good.

Too bad overall.... I really wanted to like this one.

3288778,5,B0010X744G,"Tin Man is a 21st Century adult send-off of The Wizard of Oz, first made as a feature length film, then broadcast in 3 parts on the Sci-Fi channel, and now, thankfully, available in DVD 2-disk set.  It's marvelous!  Amazingly innovative storyline, full of surprises and some serious twists on the original story, but which does not ignore the most important elements of the original cast and story line of Oz.  Dorothy Gale, the original Dorothy character, even puts in a ""black-and-white"" cameo appearance toward the end of the film, handing off her legacy to the ""new"" Dorothy - now known as DG.

The plot line keeps you guessing from start to finish!  The Wicked Witch of the West appears to be absolutely gorgeous until the 3rd hour of the film, the Wizard of Oz, played by Richard Dreyfus, is still a hero, but it's DG's father who helps DG most to save the world, and saving the world of the ""Outer Zone"" - (OZ) is what this tale is all about.  The Tin Man is an amazing hero as well, as is the scarecrow.  There is nothing juvenile about this tale of magic, bravery, the building of trust between friends and the recognition of true heroism.  There's plenty of humor, surprises and action in this story, and I found it thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.

3288781,5,B0010X744G,"I just finished watching Tin Man and I am left with total amazement!

I honestly thought that this made for TV mini series movie would be decent, and I can tell you I am truly wrong. It was not decent, but truly superb all the way around.

I thought that the alteration of an original script icon being that of the historic Wizard of Oz, would make for an interesting film, but unable to  captivate the viewer as a result of too much interfering with the original theme. Again, I was wrong. I am in shock and awe for how good this film is. I honestly believe it is the best TV mini series I have ever seen. My past favorite was Stephen King's Storm of the Century, but this tops that for sure.

If you have the films, The Princess Bride, The Goonies, Indiana Jones, The Neverending Story, Robin Hood, The Watcher in the Woods, and any other great classics that I have forgotten, and enjoyed those, than this is nothing short of those classics!  This film incorporates themes from all of the movies listed above.

While the duration of this film is nearly 4.5 hours you will realize throughout the film that the development of the plot really grows on you. This is why I had to watch this movie in one sitting. I honestly don't like movies that are more than 2-2.5 hours long. I remember sitting in the theater for Gangs of NY and I wanted to leave after the 2 hour mark.  With The Tin Man, I couldn't believe that 3hrs past and I was sad that there was only 90 minutes left!

This movie is a true masterpiece for how technology can be a great asset to incorporate many genres of an adventure/fantasy/sci-fi movie into one film without taking away from the great script and storytelling that goes on.  You will feel emotion for these characters and think about your own family and the ties that you have.  This theme makes the movie suitable for the entire family, whether you're a 32 year old adult as myself, or an 8 year old boy or girl.

It is important to realize that this is a new version of the Wizard of OZ. There will never be another original, but there is no reason why this film, Tin Man, cannot become a classic. If you are expecting a remake or close theme to the original I guarantee after 45mins you will have forgotten about those expectations.

I remember hearing about mixed reviews of the Return to OZ, 1985, and I personally have not viewed it because it got a lot of bad reviews probably because it tried to follow to the original story line too much. Well folk, Tin Man doesn't do that! It is a modern version of how power, technology, and society in the hands of evil can be developed.

If the original Wizard of OZ wasn't so powerful of a tale there is no way such a movie like, The Tin Man, could ever be produced.

The acting and cast were great all around in this film. I am so happy to have found this movie and I am quite surprised I never heard of it. The only reason I did is because I was searching for info on the new 70th Anniversary Edition of the original Wizard of OZ that is coming out on Blu-Ray at the end of September of 2009.

There you have it folks. I think I gave a decent review for how great this film is without discussing the plot in great detail.

3288801,4,B0010X744G,"""Tin Man"" is an interesting specimen of a mini-series. Based on the ""Wizard of Oz"" books by L. Frank Baum, I was initially under the impression that this was either a contemporary version of the 1939 movie or a revisionist treatment of the original children's book. Then once the film started, I realized that it was a complete re-imagining of the subject matter, in which familiar aspects of the book and movie had been redesigned in a sort of ""alternative Oz"", now called the O.Z. (short for Outer Zone). Then, in the third installment of the film, ""Tin Man"" changes again, and is revealed to be a sequel, with direct mention - and even a cameo appearance - by Dorothy Gale herself. As such, ""Tin Man"" defies any attempts to classify it. But that is only fitting considering the source material, which been involved in a range of retellings over the years, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-Wizard-of-Oz-100th-Anniversary-Edition-Books-of-Wonder/dp/0060293233/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 100th Anniversary Edition (Books of Wonder)</a>, to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wizard-of-Oz/dp/B00000JS62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wizard of Oz</a>, to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-to-Oz/dp/B0000DZ3EN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return to Oz</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-The-Life-and-Times-of-the-Wicked-Witch-of-the-West-Harper-Fiction/dp/0061350966/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (Harper Fiction)</a>&nbsp;to the stage-show spectacular. I also recall watching an animated cartoon on Saturday mornings based on Oz.

As such, I'm hesitant to give away too much of the plot for ""Tin Man"". Coming into this movie completely cold as to what to expect, half the fun was watching it all unexpectedly unfold. Basically, a young woman called DG is swept away (literally) from her life as a small-town waitress and into a world with which she feels a strange affinity.

Picking up her own versions of the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion, DG begins to traverse this strange new world on a variety of quests - for her parents, for answers, for the wizard, for memories, for her captive friends, for emeralds, for the struggle against evil...for a lot of things actually. As it turns out, the O.Z. is under the ever-growing control of the evil sorceress Azkadelia (give a girl a name like that, and how do you expect her to turn out?) who has the usual plans to take over the world with the help of a doomsday machine that only needs one last McGuffin to activate its power.

If you're sensing a healthy amount of snark in these opening paragraphs, that's because the first half-hour or so of this sprawling mini-series is difficult to warm up to. DG wears a blue-and-white gingham waitress uniform and stands momentarily in a beam of sunlight (cue eye roll). The first inhabitants of the O.Z. she meets are midgets dressed as...turkeys? I guess they were this version's idea of the Munchkins, but as members of a secret resistance hiding out in the forest, I'm not sure why they decided to dress themselves up in feathers and colourful war-paint.

Azkadelia is every clichd villain you've ever seen rolled into one. She stomps around in a dominatrix outfit, cursing and pouting, and doing things like killing inept henchmen and telling the next in line that: ""you've just been promoted."" Even worse, there are tattoos on her cleavage that turn into this adaptation's version of the winged-monkeys...in order to release them she sheds her outer-garment and thrusts her breasts toward the camera.

I was about to switch it off, but then all of a sudden...it got better! Most of the interest of the story is contained within the twists and turns concerning DG's discovery of the world and its connection with her own past, ultimately making this a story about a long-separated family trying to reunite. There's more to Azkadelia than some gold latex and an evil hairdo, as we find in her tragic back-story that gives her evil acts a purpose. And our three companions: Glitch, Cain and Raw, as the respective Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion, each get their own sub-plots that work well in the context of the over-arching tale. Furthermore, it's fun to see the creators playing around with the source material, such as a new rendering of the Yellow Brick Road, the reinterpretation of the Wizard as a ""Mystic Man"" who is perpetually high on vapours, or the literal use of a ""tin man"" in corporeal punishment, all providing echoes of the familiar story.

This is particularly true when you realize that this is the Oz of the future, taking place many years after the events that we know of in Baum's original story. What with its vaguely steam-punk, retro, mechanical atmosphere, it's easy to believe that this is an Oz that has evolved from our original understanding of that world, with the same blend of Old World resonance and newfangled technology that was present in the book. Sadly, they skipped the opportunity to add in a few details of Baum's book that have not yet made it to the screen, such as the talking field mice or the city of china people...but hey, you can't have it all.

Acting is also a mixed bag. As the protagonist, Zooey Deschanel relies on a droll, cynical tone which mostly works in her favour, but sometimes comes off a little strange. In a critical moment when her life as she knows it is turned completely on its head, she responds with sarcasm and exasperation. It rings rather false. However, her casual demeanor does serve to ground the film, and really - who could resist those big blue eyes? Neal McDonough gets the most attention as the titular Tin Man of the title, and plays his part well, but the real stand-out is Alan Cummings as Glitch, who manages to be both comedic and poignant in his portrayal of a man who has lost the greater part of himself and mournful of his awareness of this loss. There's a reason why Dorothy told the Scarecrow she'd miss him most of all, and Cummings reminds us why.

However, some of the acting, particularly among the supporting characters, is sub-par. I won't name names; suffice to say, you'll know it (and wince at it) when you see it. It's always frustrating when an expensive and generally well-made production is bought down by a lack of talent in its cast. Likewise, some of the special effects are very good, usually the rendering of the scenery and the cyclone, whereas others are awful - the CGI feeders for example.

As many have already noted, this is not for kids, as there are several sexual situations, violent scenes and coarse language. There's nothing inherently wrong with having such things when the need arises, but in this case there's little reason for it except in the attempt to darken things up. Parents would be reluctant to share this with their kids, and that's a shame considering some of the trite dialogue seems as though it was specifically written for children. It's like they're not quite sure who their audience is.

And of course, what would an adaptation like this be without an array of in-jokes, references and winks to the audience? As such, prepare for police-officers called ""Gulch"" and kids who remind each other to watch out for lions, tigers and bears *oh my!* When DG is asked: ""Had that nightmare again?"" She replies: ""In Technicolour,"" and variations of things like ""Have a heart,"" ""I've lost my marbles"" and ""Show some back-bone,"" are oft-repeated (guess what characters they refer to. Go on, guess). And that's just off the top of my head. As with everything else, some work, some don't.

On the whole, I enjoyed myself. Though it's very long, the story moves at a brisk state, and the production design is beautiful - definitely eye-candy as far as I'm concerned. I'd recommend it, just so long as you know what you're getting into before you start watching: as ""Tin Man"" is almost certainly not what you'd expect!",1236384000,3,8133,5.1771863117870724
3288802,5,B0010X744G,"Special effects are a little corny, but other than that, it's a great mini-series.  You fall right back into the old story you remember, and enjoy the new characters and interesting story.  Definitely worth watching.",1234656000,,216,5.142857142857143
3288803,4,B0010X744G,"For many people, THE WIZARD OF OZ is one of their favorite films of all time.  Frank L. Baum's original story became a hugely popular and critical success not long after it was published and the story of the THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ and over 100 years later is still popular and hugely influential (look at the massive success of the musical WICKED). Despite this, nowadays many people have never read the original story or books that Baum wrote.  If they had they would begin to see that Oz isn't necessarily the bright and always cheerful place that the 1939 pictured.  Oz was a fantastical place, but like in all fairy tales, evil and darkness is lurking in the shadows.  Just take the flying monkeys.  Many people think that monkeys are cute and sometimes they are.  But monkeys are also very cruel creatures that like to play with their own feces and can be quite vicious and the idea of monkeys that can fly and are large enough to lift a lion is very frightening.  There's all kinds of creatures like that in Oz, proving that beneath the glitter Oz can be a very scary place, indeed, and a modern update of the tale would make for a spectacular movie.

Thus, the Sci-Fi Channel stepped in and updated the story with the airing of TIN MAN in December 2007.  TIN MAN follows a young woman named DG (Zooey Deschanel).  DG is living in rural Kansas.  She works as a waitress at the local diner in town, rides a motorcycle, keeps getting chased around by Police Officer Gulch, and dreams of moving to a different place and living a more exciting life.  DG is a fantastic artist and great mechanic. She also starts having bad dreams that start to occur more and more frequently.  Late one night DG is awaken by a giant tornado, with a group of armed men in long coats, headed towards the family farmhouse.  Before she can really understand what is happening DG is being chased by the men in long coats and is pushed by her parents into the twister and taken to a completely different world, the O.Z. She undergoes a series of adventures and is joined in her quest to find her parents by a man who has had his brain taken out and has a zipper on his skull, a man who was locked in an iron suit for over a decade who used to be a police officer or ""Tin Man"", and a humanoid lion who has the gifts of healing and telepathy.

I saw the advertisements for TIN MAN when it first aired, but was unable to watch the special. It's a shame because the mini-series became the single highest television event for the Sci-Fi Channel in their history.  After a former student recommend that I watch the series, I made sure to watch it when it aired again in March 2008 and later watched the DVD.  The overarching story is familiar, but the O.Z. is a much different and darker place than the Oz that people are probably familiar.  I found the story fascinating.  The film features a great cast of highly talented actors which gives the production a slightly higher level of creditability than many other Sci-Fi specials.  The special effects are spectacular and the score is riveting.

With that said, there are a few weaknesses in the script. For instance, the timeframe that the story takes place incredible if not impossible and the whole idea of the flying monkeys being magical tattoos that fly off the wicked witch's chest is more than a bit unsettling.  I also was disappointed by the third part of the series.  The first two parts of the series were well plotted, but the third section is rushed and concludes rather abruptly.  The story would have been better if the final act was extended and more evenly paced with a satisfying epilogue.

Still the TIN MAN is a great film. It updates the story of THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ without minimizing it and in fact extends the legend of Oz.  Also, unlike many others who have seen the film I think TIN MAN is perfectly suitable for most viewers, including children.  TIN MAN is a fairy tale.  Fairy tales are supposed to have an element of darkness and suspense in them because fairy tales are really about life and sad, dark, and scary things exist in life.  Besides, flying monkeys really don't exist and if they did we should all be scared of them anyway.

Recommended for people who enjoy films with a good story, people who enjoy quality fantasy films, and people who have actually read some of the original Oz books,

- The whole ""Grey Gale"" thing was really unnecessary. (no spoiler, you'll see when you get there)

DG has very strong traits to begin with and makes complete sense when you learn her background and inherant family traits.  Women can be portrayed as strong, logical and unflustered by crisis and grow from there.  Heroes are what we love for being themselves and being better at being themselves.

For those of you expecting a nice revisiting to the land of OZ, you will be thoroughly disappointed.  This revamped take on the classic fairytale does very little other than make very loose references to the original. For those of you who love sci fi, and wish that SOMEBODY would just try to make a fairytale with science fiction, then you might enjoy this.

Tin Man basically is a nice mixture of science fiction and magic rolled into one.  As I said before, there is very little reference to the Wizard of Oz except for one scene at the end where DG goes into Dorothy's black and white Kansas to retrieve the Green Emerald.  Other than that, the whole movie is an exciting story of mystery, suspense, with a plot that will keep you interested until the end.

There are some scary images, but I certainly wouldn't stop the average tween sci-fi enthusiast from seeing it.  And as with any fairytale, there is a predictable, but still somewhat heart-warming happy ending.",1229212800,,999,4.706896551724138
3288820,4,B0010X744G,"Prepare yourself for surprising and unexpected twists and turns in an Oz that even Judy Garland wouldn't be able to recognize. This time it's Zooey Deschanel as DG (i.e. Dorothy Gale), the traveler, or ""slipper"" between worlds who finds herself in a perilous situation that makes the original 1939 film look like a carefree walk in the park. Though this is a made-for-television mini-series the production values are stellar and the cast superior. I don't think Zooey has ever let me down and her courageous companions; Alan Cumming, Neal McDonough and Raoul Truijillo add a lot of energy and personality to keep the audience focused on this somewhat overly lengthy production. Kathleen Robertson was also a big plus as DG's older, allegedly evil sister Azkadellia, adding a much appreciated touch of sexuality to keep the adult, male audience occupied.

What really makes this storyline unique and entertaining is the massive use of creative license to adapt the original plot, landscape and characters into a new imaginative vision while still maintaining a credible link with the original cinematic classic. The first indication one gets that this tale will be different from what they're used to comes just by reading the title chosen for this mini-series. Why would they omit Oz and Dorothy from the title and call it `Tin Man'? To be sure more surprises lay ahead for the intrepid viewer. The second major change is the clever way in which the word Oz is changed from the name of a place to an acronym of a place. It's not Oz anymore, it's the O.Z. meaning the Outer Zone. Yes there are lots of subtle alterations like this to keep the viewing audience on its toes.

I was also pleased by the updated metamorphosis taken place within the ranks of DG's trio of fellow sojourners. The Scarecrow was no more, now replaced by Glitch (Cumming), a lobotomized human with a prominent zipper down the middle of his hairline, an ex-cop named Cain (McDough) nicknamed Tin Man because of the badge he used to carry and Raw (Truijillo), a member of a race of empathic, hairy, lion-like beings who possess the ability to read minds. Even little, loveable Toto has returned, but not in a form you would have ever anticipated. Toto is only the animal form of a shapeshifter known as Tutor when in human form. Be prepared for a lot more changes than just the few mentioned here.

On the negative side I'd have to mention the Evil Witches scheme to bring permanent darkness to the O.Z. wasn't very original. If you've seen `Kull the Conqueror' ('97) or `Hellboy ('07) you've seen it before. The other drawback is the length of the production which is a common concern when it comes to mini-series. About midway through you might find yourself losing interest, however If you make it to Part 3 the storyline accelerates and you'll find yourself infused with a shot of adrenaline with the introduction of several unanticipated plot maneuvers that will carry the now invigorated viewer to the end.",1226188800,2,2983,4.833659491193738

The premise of a young girl (who may or may not be the granddaughter of a well known WoO character, I won't spoil it) who travels to another dimension to save the O.Z. is not new, but the steampunk twist on it is.

That's not to say that everything was perfect, mind you. At times the plotline seemed to lag a little and there were many developments that seemed to be somewhat unexplained or left to the side in hopes of a sequel or tv series. Still, these are very minor flaws when looked at as a whole and ones that can be forgiven.

My close-second (after Return to Oz) favorite film rendition of Oz is the recent SciFi miniseries, Tin Man. It keeps all the magic and fairy tale of the original works, but this time infusing it with new energy and more modern twists. This is a much more adult version of Oz, but it still maintains the perfect balances of magic and meaning, fairytale and modern images, and it is still distinctly American.

Baum, I believe, would have loved this clever adaptation of his stories. It totally keeps the spirit, the meaning, the heart, and the magic of the Oz tales. The magic is still here in the form of the American fairy tale: a brilliant blending of bits of American life (subberbia fallen, a doomsday machine, drugs, bars and psychics) and mechanisms (robots, super computers, hippie vans) with the land of the fairy (witches, monsters, princes and princesses). The symbolism/meaning of Baum is still here; the commentary on American life is still here.

DG (played by the wonderful Zooey Deschanel, who maintains a difficult balance between wide-eyed child and cynical adult, human and magical creature), like Ozma and other Oz heroines, is a little lost girl on her journey through a warped and symbolic version of her own world. She is a lost princess on the search for her identity. Like Dorothy, her greatest strength is her courage and her ability to make odd friends along the Brick Road.

In the O.Z., DG meets up with symbolic and damaged characters that help her on her way. The Scarecrow figure, Glitch, was once a high ranking bureaucrat, a Daedalous figure that made amazing inventions, some of which are being corrupted and used for great evil by the new government. Here is the threat of the cleverness and American inventiveness and modernization. Even worse, Glitch's brain has been tampered with, reducing him to a gibbering, amnesia-ridden idiot. He doesn't know who he was or what he has fallen from. The Tin Man, Cain, was locked in a tin box and forced to watch his family tortured and killed over and over again. A jaded ex-cop (or Tin Man), he may not be made out of metal, but his heart is certainly absent. Raw, a psychic and spiritual character, is part of a species that is abused for their powers and abilities. The evil witch, Az, uses drugs, spiritualism, brainwashing, torture, and machines to keep her power and do evil.

The production design is very clever. It keeps the magic and mystical nature of Baum's fairy tale (particularly reflecting the illustrations of the books with the girls costumes). It also borrows from the 1930s period (the time of the original film), but warping it into more Film Noir, so that--visually--we have the same world. For instance, the cars and nightclub, the girl's hair styles. Mixing fairy tale images with the Film Noir is a brilliant blend that creates modern darkness and an otherworly feel. Other images are a nod to the original story, particularly the bronze machines with very visible bolts and the electric beams. There is plenty of modern culture mixed in, too. This Oz, just as Baum's Oz, is populated by robots (who actually raised DG) who live in a now-run-down 1950s suburban town that was once a near-Utopia but is now reduced to rubble. DG's father flies a hot air balloon, just as the original wizard did.

The story has enough twists and turns and revelations, darkness and triumph, to maintain the many hours of the miniseries. But the real appeal is all the images and effects, the many very likeable and complicated characters played by quite talented actors. If you're a fan of the original Oz books, or just an adult that likes a good fairy tale, check this one out. It's from the guys that gave us the fantastic and thoroughly clever adult fairy tale, The 10th Kingdom. I hope they'll be giving us more, too.

So, I was very pleased to see that over the past couple of years there have been several new mini series that have popped up, and quite a few of them have been from the Sci Fi Channel.

And, thanks to DVD's, I've been able to purchase these DVD's and have been able to watch these mini series at my leisure... which usually means watching the entire thing in one shot because my wife hates to wait.

The first one I bought and watched was the mini series called Tin Man. This was a re-imagining of the classic Wizard of Oz.

And I do mean re-imagining.

Now, I have stated before I've never read the original Oz novel, but I did read Wicked. I will also state that this mini series had far more in common with the Wicked novel than it did the original Wizard of Oz movie starring Judy Garland.

D. G., a young woman working as a waitress feels that she doesn't belong. Sure, her family loves her dearly and they are close, but she never felt at home.

Well, as you can imagine, there is a good reason for this. This world, the family she's with, she doesn't actually belong here at all. She was actually born in the O.Z, or the Outer Zone.

And it isn't until she finds herself under attack from complete strangers in the middle of a storm that she learns the truth.

One unexpected tornado ride later, she finds herself deposited in a strange and unsettlingly familiar world.

It's in this world that she discovers her true heritage, and the truth behind her parents, and the people she believed were her parents.

Just like in the original movie, D.G. finds companions on her journey. A former Advisor to the Queen, who's had his brain removed, the Tin Man, a police officer with vengeance on his mind, and a hirsute man who can see images through emotions - and who is quite the coward.

Sound familiar?

The mini series is a quest. D.G. has to locate the powerful Mystic Man in a Vegas like city to find out where she needs to go next and what she's to do to fulfill her destiny.

Visually it was quite impressive, although the acting was pretty average, as none of the actors in the movie really stuck out in my mind.

The movie starred Zooey Deschanel starred as D.G., Alan Cumming as Glitch, Neal McDonough as the Tin Man, Raoul Trujillo as Raw, Kathleen Robertson as Azkadellia and Richard Drefuss as the Mystic Man.

I have to admit that despite the fact that it had so little to do with what I remember about the Wizard of Oz, I was enthralled by the mini series and I did enjoy it.

Even though it was quite clich in parts.

The one thing that set it apart from a full length series is that it had a clearly defined beginning, middle and end. There really wasn't any `filler' as you would find in a typical series, which meant that the writers could tell the story in one shot.

I hope that this won't be construed as a spoiler, but near the end of the mini series it is discovered that it is, in fact, more of a sequel than an actual re-imagining. I don't know about other people, but I liked that.

The world itself is a mixture of magic and modern technology. You have powerful sorcerers, people who can read thoughts, Tornados that can break the barriers between worlds, but you also have gun-slingers, automobiles and the like.

It was worth watching, and I found it quite enjoyable. It certainly has renewed my interest in the mini series, something we haven't seen in a very long time.

This, at the time of me writing this review is just the first of four mini series that I have and will be watching. The Lost Room, Triangle and the Andromeda Strain.

3288852,5,B0010X744G,"When the Wizard of Oz was first released during the Great Depression, my Dad was a ten year old providing for his family by farm labor (picking cotton by hand etc) in the Arizona ""farmland"" around Eloy Arizona. When I was a child he related the story to me of how he paid to get in to see The Wizard of Oz for the first time, he traded the metallic tops off of milk bottles.

When I was a boy growing up in the wonderland now known as the ""OC"" (five miles from Disneyland, 1 mile from Knott's berry farm (of course back then it was a berry farm) and 12 miles from Huntington Beach) my favorite day of the year was the night that The Wizard of Oz would come on TV. Then, in 1967 when we got our first ""Color TV"" I loved it even more. Then came the age of VHS, and DVD and as my children grew up, we have watched the Wizard of Oz over and over every year, and the My first grand-daughter got old enough to watch it, it also became a favorite of hers. So for Four generations The Wizard of Oz has been a favorite in my family.

So when I saw advertisements, for Tin Man on Sci-Fi Channel, I had a certain amount of trepidation for watching what I assumed would be a retelling of one of my all time favorite films. I didn't get around to setting the TIVO to record it when it came on and I forgot all about it until I saw it for sale at a club store. I still didn't want to get it enough to buy it until one of my colleagues told me how much he liked it. So.... This weekend I got around to buying TIN MAN.

Here is my take.

Tin Man is not a re-telling of The Wizard of Oz. It takes place in the future of Dorothy's visit. It is a darker slightly more mature tale, probably not appropriate for pre-teens.

Wizard of Oz was a wonderful musical, Tin Man is a straight up fantasy. I think this is a wise decision.  Musicals should be left to Disney for the time being.

Wizard of Oz, had really cutting edge effects for the time, but are quite cheesy by today's standards, Tin Man had amazing special affects. Wizard of Oz had very funny parts, which were kind of lacking in Tin Man. Metaphors were different in both movies some played better in one, and some better in the other. But the two big metaphors still stand out, from the Wizard of Oz home is the place that is important, and in Tin Man family is who is important.  I also liked the aspect of redemption and resolution that was the gist of the story of Tin Man.

So is Tin Man destined to be a classic on the order of the Wizard of Oz? I'd say probably not. Is it a very good way to spend a few hours of your time? Absolutely, it is one of the best new things I have seen in quite some time. Is it well spent money? Absolutely, I think I will watch this several times more, just not as many times as I have watched the Wizard of Oz.

If you like a fantasy film with a modern twist, beautifully filmed with a bit of cheese on top, then this is a film for you",1210636800,2,2912,3.979416809605489
3288853,5,B0010X744G,"Good acting, but even more, it's got a fascinating script. Takes everything from ""The Wizard of Oz,"" but turns it on its head and adds a dark side to it all. Really good special effects. ""Oz"" for the 21st century.",1210550400,,213,4.35

3288855,4,B0010X744G,"I must admit that I was hesitant to watch SciFi Channel's revisioning of ""The Wizard of Oz"" due to the fact that they were heavily promoting it.  I've learned through the years that 95% of all films, television series, and music that is heavily hyped is usually not that great in the end.  I was pleasantly surprised with this excellent story written by Craig Van Sickle and Steven Long Mitchell.  The tale centers around D.G., a young girl who doesn't feel like she fits in her hometown.  Her parents always talk of better times in a town that seems otherworldly.  Little does she know that there is another place in the magical and mystical O.Z.  When she's chased into a tornado, D.G. finds herself in a world where the wicked Azkadellia and her goons (including flying monkeys) are out to retrieve a secret from her that she doesn't even know she has.  Along the way, D.G. meets a group of unlikely heroes like the goofy Glitch, the sensitive Raw, and the standoffish Cain.  What's D.G.'s secret? Who's the Mystic Man?  What destiny awaits D.G. and her friends?  Watch ""Tin Man"" to find out.

Directed by Nick Willing, ""Tin Man"" features an excellent cast.  The lovely Zooey Deschanel portrays D.G.  Kathleen Robertson is wickedly fun as Azkadellia.  Alan Cumming shines as Glitch, and steals many scenes in this film.  Raoul Trujillo, who's known to fans of SciFi Channel's ""Frankenfish"" as Ricardo, displays solid emotion as the tortured Raw.  Richard Dreyfuss does an excellent, albeit brief, job as the Mystic Man.  Neal McDonough portrays the title character, and his performance begs the question as to why he hasn't broken out as a legitimate star in his own right.

The special effects are very good for a made-for-TV story.  The music is above par as well.  Willing drives the story along at a solid pace, littering it with a nice blend of humor, suspense and action.  Fans of  L. Frank Baum's book and the classic film adaptation will see plenty of nods to both.

The DVD's special features are okay, but nothing really stands out except for the interviews of the primary cast.  McDonough and Cumming provide the most interesting interviews.  There's a gag reel that's more of a silly documentary than actual goofs. There is also""On The Set With The Director,"" and ""Beyond The Yellow Brick Road,"" which gives the viewer a look behind the scenes.

As a whole, SciFi Channel and co. have outdone themselves with this mini-series.  They acquired a solid cast, good special effects and excellent direction and produced a wonderful new vision of a classic tale.  Highly recommended to fans of fantasy and sci-fi as well as fans of children's fantasy tales.  There is a bit of language and some violence, but parents should feel safe letting their older kids (seven and up) watch this film with them.  Just be ready to ""cough"" when Azkadellia make a remark about D.G. and where she happens to be going.",1210204800,6,2910,4.773547094188377

3288857,3,B0010X744G,"Tin Man was a Sci Fi Channel mini-series where a more modern look is taken of Frank Baums The Wizard of Oz.  As with the original, the main character is a young lady from Kansas, rather than going by the name Dorothy though, she's called DG.  Also rather than being the cheerful girl who sings us along the Yellow Brick Road we have a young lady who's a little darker and feeling she's missing something in her life.  Btw, for those not familiar, OZ in this telling is short for Outer Zone.

The Good
I loved the Tin Man character.  Neal McDonough does a very good job showing us a man with heart and I also loved the setup for why he's that way.  Alan Cumming does a good job as Glitch (the Scarecrow), and I enjoyed Kathleen Robertson (the wicked witch) and Zooey Deschanel (DG)in the first portion of the movie.  Also, Richard Dryfus does a great job as the Mystic Man (the Wizard).  Very interesting...
Story wise I loved the set up for the characters.  The background for DG, Glitch, Tin Man and Raw (the Lion) are interesting.  I also found myself interested in DG's family background, the relationship to the Wicked Witch, and also the relationship between this telling of the Wizard of Oz and the original (very nicely done when DG meets Dorothy Gale).  The other big plus is showing  OZ as being a dark place.  This was best shown with Central City.

The Bad
The worst bad was the bad guys.  Zero was a Zero.  The bad guys were incompetent and you almost have the feeling that if it weren't for the flying monkeys that DG and the rest would have walked away with everything.  In the story telling department part 2 dragged a little.  Some movements in the story were abrupt; others weren't finished very well because they chose to follow the stereotype.  The worst part of this is when we go from the Central City to the Ice Palace on the Northern Island and DG meets her sister and becomes her prisoner.  Other weaknesses included Raw and his kind; while nice it just didn't sell as well as it might have; and the bad guys equipment.  A surplus M-3 halftrack, an armored car, and some guys running around in dusters with firearms just didn't impress me.  If the director would have dropped the WWII surplus and the dusters it might have been better.

Special Features
These were lacking to put it simply.  Yes they have interviews with the director (in about three different versions) but nothing that moved me.  I was looking for cut scenes, wardrobe, and there one called Bloopers I was expecting Bloopers rather than looking at the behind the scene staff.

The Rating
I'll call this one 3.5 stars.  I enjoyed the setup but the middle part almost put me to sleep.  I do admire the effort that was done with this and I do believe the director should have had a real shot at a true mini-series (three episodes isn't enough.  1 or 2 more would have been better for the story).  That said, I don't believe this is truly 4 star material.  It's enjoyable and I'll watch it again but it's not something that will draw me to it on a regular bases.",1209254400,5,3051,4.443243243243243

3288866,5,B0010X744G,"""Tin Man (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"" is a superb reworking of both L. Frank Baum's ""Wizard of Oz"" and the classic 1939 film loosely based on it, skillfully weaving elements of both, while creating a world uniquely it's own. This is an Oz with real magic, and equal parts of wonder, humor, and terror, a land I didn't want to leave!

Much of the credit goes to the Jill E. Blotevogel, Steven Long Mitchell, and Craig W. Van Sickle teleplay, which avoids the slavish devotion to the 1939 film of previous ""Oz"" incarnations. While it tackles some classic questions from the original movie, head on (""Was Glinda actually Dorothy's mother, as her character was the only one in the film without a Kansas counterpart?""), it also reminds viewers that Baum's book wasn't only an American fairy tale, but a cautionary fable of industrial 'progress' butting heads with an agrarian society. Oz is a land of change, a multitude of cultures, and the uneasy coexistence of sorcery with a rising machine culture.

Keeping all this from becoming too 'heavy' is director Nick Willing's tongue-in-cheek humor, and a terrific cast, headed by Zooey Deschanel as a less-than-reverent DG. Her skepticism and growing awareness of her actual role in events is the core of the film, and she is quite wonderful. Equally good are her companions, Alan Cumming as zipper-headed ""Glitch"" (his brain was stolen), Neal McDonough as an ex-lawman (first encountered imprisoned in a metallic 'suit'), and Raoul Trujillo (looking remarkably like Bert Lahr) as a cowardly member of a lion-like telepathic species. Yes, Toto is here, too (but there is a surprise I'll let you discover when you view the film!)

The witches and wizards are a major treat of the film, although Richard Dreyfuss' role, based on the Wizard of Oz, himself, is smaller than you'd expect. However, lovely Kathleen Robertson, as the wicked witch Azkadellia, is fabulous, with an old crone within her every bit as ugly as Margaret Hamilton!

There is so much to enjoy in ""Tin Man"", and so many subtle references to Baum's vision and the 1939 film, that it simply can't be viewed only once. I've watched it three times, and I'm STILL finding things...

The fight scenes are so bad you could see a foot of space between the characters who were supposedly getting hit. This whole thing is not convincing in any way shape or form.

Don't get me wrong. I am not the kind of person to dole out bad reviews. I like most fantasy fiction and much science fiction and appreciate it for where it originated and how it is done. This dvd just turned me off.

3288896,4,B0010X744G,"First off, the first thing you see is the cover. Well, the holographic foil on the paperboard sleeve is pretty striking. (Wait... The paperboard sleeve is the collectible O-Ring packaging?) Only problem is... the original cover design (and an early poster) were pretty dynamic. This falls a little flat.

Okay, when you insert the first DVD (both of which look pretty nice, but you can easily tell which one is which), you get the copyright notice, the company notice, some previews (which I didn't note, but there's quite a few), then the menu has a nice animation, and a nice little movie showing clips from the whole series. (Disc 2 is the same, without the previews.)

Disc 1 has Part 1 and Part 2 on it, no special features. Also absent is alternate language tracks, alternate audio tracks (so no commentary), and subtitles. (There is also no Closed Captions, but this isn't on a DVD menu.) There are scene selections, eight scenes for each part, and the scene selections for each part run into each other, reminding you that these are both parts of one story.

The story opens with a young woman named DG who lives in Kansas with her folks. She has strange dreams where she sees strange scenes and a beautiful woman with lavendar eyes speaks and sings to her. She is a free spirit, ready to tease Officer Elmer Gulch (yes, you heard right) on her motorcycle.

But a storm is coming...

DG and her parents are surprised one night by men in strange trenchcoats. DG is led to the roof by her parents and is made to jump into a tornado!
DG awakes in a strange country, where she finds ruin from her house in Kansas, no sign of her parents, and midgets who capture her, believing her to be a spy of the Sorceress Azkadelia. While imprisoned, she meets Glitch, a man with a zipper in his skull. Half of his brain has been removed, so ""sometimes my synapses don't fly right."" He reveals that DG has entered ""The O.Z.,"" the Outer Zone.

DG and Glitch escape, and wind up rescuing Wyatt Cain, a Tin Man, one of the Mystic Man's police force. Cain helps them save Raw (a ""viewer,"" a half beast/half man race. Raw himself bears a resemblance to the portrayals of the Cowardly Lion by Bert Lahr and Ted Ross.) from becoming dinner in the Fields of the Papay.

As they take the Old Road (or ""The Brick Route"") to Central City, DG discovers that the O.Z. is in fact her home. She finds her ""parents"" (or, as they call themselves, ""nurture units"") are more android than human. In fact, they are not her parents. Her mother seems to be the mysterious woman from her dreams.

DG and her comrades make it to Central City, where they see the Mystic Man, who reveals that DG needs to unlock her memories, so DG must go north.

As DG journeys the O.Z., she (and we, as the audience) discovers many fascinating items of her past. Azkadelia is wicked, or is she? Who are her parents? Who was the other girl she lived with in the O.Z.? What secrets lie in the past of Glitch and Cain? And what is the Emerald of the Eclipse, and where is it?

The acting in Tin Man is superb. Zooey Deschanel as DG is endearing, although some feel her natural charm was wasted on the role. Alan Cumming is hilarious and serious as Glitch, pulling off the role with a professional air. Neal McDonough is dead-serious as Cain, but can be emotional when he needs to. Raoul Trujillo is excellent at re-inventing the mighty, sniveling beast. And Kathleen Robertson... WOW! She pulls off evil in a way that rivals Tilda Swinton!

The special effects and CG are almost believable. Not quite lifelike, but these work excellently.

The story is captivating and intriguing. The writing is simply delicious. However, something lacks: there is a lot of backstory not explained in the 4 & 1/2 hours that Tin Man approximately runs for. I would like to see the story continue, myself. Maybe a sequel, or TV series, or series of sequels?

The video quality is very good. I believe it's the best definition you can get on a standard DVD. The episodes have been extended. There are additional little scenes, like more fun with Glitch, more evilness with Azkadelia, and more tracking with Cain. These scenes neither make the series better nor make it worse.

Disc 2 only has Part 3 and the Special Features. Part 3 is also extended.

In addition, the opening title card and credits are now absent from parts 2 & 3 (but the video is still there) and there is no end credits on parts 1 & 2, and the opening credits on part 1 and the end credits on part 3 have been expanded to cover the entire series.

The Special Features are quite good, making this another rarity when it comes to Oz DVDs. (Very few have good special features.)

First up is the ""Beyond the Yellow Brick Road: The Making of Tin Man"" feature. This was aired on SciFi about a week before the miniseries (and was also a popular bootleg download and the only feature available on bootleg Tin Man DVDs), so this makes it a nice addition.

Next up is a new documentary: ""On The Set With The Director,"" a documentary that, once again, goes behind the scenes and lets the cast and crew talk about working with director Nick Willing.

Now we have the ""Blooper Reel."" Ah, yes. We all love to see the cast mess up on their lines and cues... except that doesn't happen much here. It's mostly the crew joking around and the cast having downtime. Still fun to watch, but it should have been called by a different name.

Next up is raw footage of interviews with Nick Willing, Zooey Deschanel, Alan Cumming, and Neal McDonough. Some of this, if you're watching the special features sequentially, will sound familiar, as some of it was used in the featurettes. You can also faintly hear the interviewer asking questions and the director, actor or actress listening to them. This can be a little distracting, but most of the time it is bearable. Sadly, Miss Deschanel is not a good interviewee. She even has to ask the interviewer to re-state the actual question. We do learn some interesting things about the cast and crew, though.

Finally is the full-length Tin Man trailer. This was all over the Internet, and probably on SciFi, too, so you've probably seen it.

All in all, if I had to rate this DVD on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give it an 8. Lack of subtitles, closed captioning (come on, fans whipped up a set of subtitles for the bootleg video files), and the special features, while there is a considerable amount, could have been a bit better.

I say, add it to your Oz collection. It's probably the best re-imagining of Oz that goes far-out while not raping Baum's original vision that we'll get for a long time.

If you buy the DVD at Borders, specially marked DVDs have an exclusive premium, an acetane pouch with a third disc inside the case.

The menu is not unlike the Special Features on Disc 2. We have three selections here. The first two are fancily titled interviews with Kathleen Robertson and Raoul Trujillio. These are much like the interviews on Disc 2, the actor and actress not in costume, seated in what looks like one of the sets, answering questions from the same interviewer, who we can't hear any better than we could before. Both Kathleen and Raoul interview very well, and the interviews are a little over ten minutes long each.

The other item is over a half-hour long. It shows behind-the-scenes footage of the Mystic Man's show, including a deleted item wherein Zooey Deschanel's DG asks the Mystic Man for help. (We also get a good look at some decor at the show: a pillar shaped like a cyclone with many farmhouse items being spun around in it.) However, the repeated takes of the Mystic Man's show gets old very quickly. To be sure, this gives you a taste of what it's like to work on a film, but when you're not involved, it gets dull.

As with many premium bonus DVDs, this disc is not completely satisfying, but it is nice to see these uncut interviews with Kathleen and Raoul. As afore mentioned, the behind-the-scenes of the Mystic Man gives us a realistic glimpse of how much time is taken to shoot a scene that runs for just a few minutes. Altogether, not a bad addition.

(Thanks to Sharon of Curiozity Corner for confirming the existence of the Borders DVD and identifying the material the pouch is made of.)",1207094400,2,8255,4.518443997317236
3288897,3,B0010X744G,"The black and white ""The Wizard of Oz"" movie this is not, but is it a good mini series that departs from Dorothy's ruby slippers and explores a much deeper and modernized side of the fantasy world created by L.

She seems to be in a trance for most of the movie with furrowed brow prominent in almost every close-up and then at the end she turns into a smiling, happy go lucky girl with actual emotion.

There's a Dorothy, who's called ""DG""; a tin man (meaning ""a cop"" here) who was stored in a steel casing for years; the scarecrow is ""Glitch"", a man whose facial features resemble Ray Bolger's (the scarecrow from the 1939 movie), but was an assistant to the good queen and got his brain taken out; the cowardly lion is ""Raw"", who is a psychic.  The travellers must travel through incredible lands (beautiful, fabulous sets and good special effects) to face many dangers as ""DG"" seeks out her real mother and tries to re-unite with her family.  This is a movie the entire family can enjoy.  Tho it is quite a different take from the Oz version we are used to seeing, everything is explained. No sex and some tame violence.  It feels like you're playing a video game, reaching a different level as the group reaches a different land.  It's gripping, fascinating, sometimes humorous, unlike anything I've seen before.

By the time the show played, I was really looking forward to it.  Unfortunately, it did not deliver at all and reminded me of SciFi's saturday night homemade cheap horror flicks.
Ms Deschanel had one expression-----wide-eyed something for every situation that came along.  The story lurched along with big gaps in the story line.  I just read an article in a magazine that gave this show an A+ so I thought I would check here and see what real people were saying.  I guess I am out of touch or something because I see alot loved it but for my part it was a very large disappointment.

3288901,4,B0010X744G,"Tin Man is a Sci-Fi channel miniseries that came out in late 2007.  It is a remake of the Wizard of Oz story; supposedly set several generations after the original Judy Garland version of the Wizard of Oz.  As a remake, many things have changed.  First of, Dorothy is not a blond-haired, blue-eyed prudish girl.  Instead, we have DG, a disillusioned tomboyish teenager with black hair and a subtle ""whatever"" attitude.  She is transported to the OZ (short for Outer Zone) by a tornado, but once there the story is very different.  She does meet a tin man, who is actually a local sheriff.  There is a cowardly lion, though with very impressive powers, and instead of a scarecrow, we have a lobotomized scientist with hidden martial arts skills.

This OZ does have a wicked witch, though instead of old and ugly, she is actually a hot babe who dresses provocatively.  Like the original version, there is a great secret revealed, though here it relates to the wicked witch.  I personally like this story better as it is very original, with none of the traditional cliches.  So I give this a 5/5 stars for the storyline.

However, the execution could have been better.  The audio and visual effects were all believable, and the cinematography was good.  What was lacking was the costumes.  For a land far far away, all the good guys wore dresses similar to what Americans wore during the 1940s and 50s.  And the witch's henchman dress eerily like Nazis.  So lack of innovation in the costume.  The soundtrack is also quite repetitive, and seems better suited for trailer music.  A movie like this deserves a full blown orchestral score.  So for execution, I give this movie 3/5 stars.

My final disappointment was the lack of subtitles.  Overall, a good movie and worth the time to watch it.  But not spectacular.",1206403200,,1810,4.712460063897764

Tin Man is not a cinematic, theatrical masterpiece. It is what it is: a T.V. miniseries, and it's one of the best I've ever seen. Like The 10th Kingdom from years and years ago it incorporated just enough from my memories of reading those childhood stories to be nostalgic while being edgy and 'modern' enough to hold my attention now.

There are the obvious parallels: Cain/Tin Man, DG/Dorothy, Azkadelia/WWotW, etc. and then there are the more subtle things. DG's calm manner and witty one liners mirror Dorothy's easy acceptance of a world that should have been terrifying, the trek to the Northern Palace, the ways in which each was injured during the fight at said Northern Palace, etc.

3288926,1,B0010X744G,"This was disappointing overall. I was excited when I heard they were doing a sci-fi version of the story, but in the back of my mind there was this gnawing doubt that turned out to be dead on correct. Hollywood, especially television, is a wasteland with very few pleasant spots, and here is yet another tumbleweed rolling by.
I understand that a great deal of people enjoyed this miniseries which Sci-Fi Channel dubbed 'The Event of the Year'. I am not attacking them, I am simply expressing my own opinion of this presentation.

For me this was simply another digital effects laden film that did not have very much to offer. The idea of a new twist on L. Frank Baum's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (which is what this miniseries was touted as being) sounded interesting, but the result was pure disappointment. The creators of this project seemed to not have even cracked open the original Baum book. When I first learned that this was going to be based on the book, I hoped for scenes that involved the Quadling Country, the China People, the mice, the green eyeglasses, a one-eyed witch with control over bees and wolves. What I got was typical fare of today's TV movies, and it wasn't surprising at all. Sci-Fi Channel's original movies are hardly good entertainment anyway.

It's a shame because this movie could have been good. Between the original book and the MGM musical, there is much to play with in terms of story and themes. But it was all lifeless, washed out looking, dull, and even cringe-inducing at times. ""The little bitch has gone to see the wizard."" Come on. Really? And the Azkadelia character (or Vidalia or Azkaban or whatever she's called) had just two expressions: icy suppressed rage and snide sarcasm. Not a threatening villain in the least for me. And the whole sisters plot idea is from the moon.

The Oz material is really a children's territory, and when you twist it into adult fantasy it doesn't work well at all. See Gregory Macguire's novel ""Wicked"" with its adult themes, byzantine writing style, and transformation of an evil witch into a misunderstood misfit and an animal rights activist. Eeew.

And at times, ""Tin Man"" almost shows glimmers of interest, but then a character will open his mouth and say the most cliched, trite bit of corny drivel, and remind you instantly that you are watching something that is not good.

3288928,3,B0010X744G,"WARNING:  SOME SPOILERS

I loved the premise behind this--a darker, more adult, epic fantasy version of the Wizard of Oz.  I was actually pretty psyched about seeing this.  Did it deliver?  Well, kind of.

The plot moves along at a good clip for the most part, and the special effects are surprisingly well-done for a made-for-TV miniseries.  I liked that the monkey bats seemed to be some sort of puppetry or stop motion rather than entirely CGI.  But overall, I was left with the feeling that this series could have been so much better.

One of the biggest problems for me was the dialogue.  Tin Man suffers from a severe case of ""writer speak""--characters spout lots of ""clever"" lines that no real person would ever say.  It doesn't help that Zooey Deschanel seems to be locked into a narrow range of acting.  I don't know if it's her fault or the director's, but regardless of what's going on she conveys a deadpan, sardonic nonchalance.  When she's swept into another world by a supernatural storm, she takes it in stride with a shrug and a quip.  When the munchkins (now a bunch of psychotic, ugly tree-dwelling trolls) discuss torturing her for information, she seems only mildly disgruntled.  ""You're out of your tiny minds,"" she tells them, in the same complaining tone someone might say, ""This burger is overdone.""  I understand that they wanted her to be a tough heronine.  Fine, but a little bit of realistic human emotion wouldn't hurt.  A lot of the cutesy abbreviations got to me, as well.  Dorothy Gale is now ""DG.""  Oz is ""the O.Z.""  I'm surprised the Wizard wasn't ""the Big W"" or something.

My other main complaint is the villain's motive, or non-motive, rather.  Azkadallia wants some special emerald she can put into a machine that will blot out the sun and engulf the O.Z. in darkness.  Why?  What is that going to accomplish?  In the original Wizard of Oz the Wicked Witch is one-dimensionally evil for no reason--which is forgivable, considering that it's a children's book.  Tin Man is supposed to be a more serious, adult version of the tale, so I was hoping for a more complex and realistic villain.  There's a bit of a twist toward the end revealing that Azkadallia is possessed by some kind of evil entity resembling a witch, but that doesn't change much.  We still have a main villain (the witch entity) who does evil things for no apparent reason.  No moral ambiguity here.

Despite all this, I don't regret watching Tin Man.  There were some genuinely funny moments and enough twists and turns in the plot to keep me engaged.  But though it was entertaining, I didn't feel like it really left me with anything to think about.",1201996800,104,2657,4.681818181818182
3288929,5,B0010X744G,"When I first heard that this show was being done into a mini-series instead of a movie I was all pysched.  Then I started reading things on the Sci-Fi website about it and thought, what a minute, where are the little people, the wicked witch, the flying monkees?  Ok, so they kept the flying monkees but they took the liberty to do an entirely different show and went an entirely different direction that I ever would have thought possible.  I TIVO'd the mini-series and decided to wait until all three nights were taped so I could watch them all at once because I know me, once I get hooked I can't wait for the next episode, by the way, SETTLE THE WRITERS STRIKE, PLEASE!  OK with that being said, I found this mini-series well WRITTEN (writers), well acted, and directed.  I like how they introduce each character and you get to figure out which of these is the scarecrow, lion, and tin man.  Toto isn't what toto seems to be but I won't say anymore, you will have to watch it to see.  Richard Dreyfuss as the Wizard gave a great performance as did Zooey Deschannel, Neal McDonough, Alan Cumming, Raoul Trujillo, and Kathleen Robertson.  I can't wait for the release on DVD, I already have it pre-ordered through Amazon.  If you are into Sci-Fi or fantasy movies and series, then I highly recommend you give this mini-series a shot.

Most all of the characters were great and the actors that played them did a fabulous job.  The biggest problem was Zooey Deschanel.  Her acting was sub-par at best.  Her character had no personality and her emotions were almost non-existent.  I have seen Zooey in other movies and have felt that her deadpan characters were charming and worked for the most part in other movies. But,  for Tin Man they really needed to pick an actor that had the ability to show some sort of emotion and did not look like they were walking through the whole mini series in a fog.

All in all I enjoyed this mini series.  The other actors and the creative twist on the Wizard of Oz was what made this show.  If we could go back in time and put another actress in the lead, I would have given Tin Man 5 stars.",1200182400,8,946,4.176795580110498

It went on and on. They could have easilly made it a two-parter. I was surprised to see everybody on here liked it that much.
One question comes to mind: Why was the series called ""Tin Man""? It certainly wasn't really about him.
The writing wasn't that good. It often felt like a play. The music was pretty lame. Constantly hearing that same short theme through all 3 episodes.
After seeing the show I cancelled my pre-order. Maybe some day at half price.

3288948,4,B0010X744G,"I've been dieing for a good Fantasy mini-series to come along for awhile now. It's been awhile since Merlin or the 10th Kingdom. Tin Man may hack the Wizard of Oz story to bits trying to recreate the story and it succeeds in being entertaining even if it is silly. Tin Man is just fun and well acted and I honestly didn't even want it to end. Neal McDonough (Walking Tall) I always thought of as poor man's Ray Liotta but he gives what should be a star making performance. He gives the more interesting performance of the mini-series. He plays Cain who's a former Tin Man ""the name of the police of the O Z"" who is a broken man due to his haunting past.

  I always had a crush on Zooey Deschanel since Elf but I'm still not even sure if she was good as DG or not. She has a lovely voice so the one part I think she really shined is when she sings in one part. Other than that she acts just a little too dopey and expressionless. Alan Cumming is fun as a bit of a fruit ""but cool fruit lol"" that had his brain stolen by Azkadellia ""the Witch"". I find it strange that he doesn't remember much yet he remembers that he can dance and takes out some guards with his dance moves. But hey it's all good fun anyway. Kathleen Robertson as Azkadellia makes a sexy villain but the fact that the flying monkeys fly out of a tattoo on her cleavage almost kills an almost flawless and fun mini-series. Oh plus you might even find it dumb that the Cowardly Lion's name is...Raw and that he's a....psychic or that Toe Toe is a shape shifter. I found that all silly yet I just couldn't stop watching and I hope everyone that watched it gave it a chance. It would be nice if something like Tin Man is released on Sci-Fi every year, well as long as it's this fresh and fun.",1198972800,3,1755,4.140762463343108

But I thought this was an extremely interesting and dramatic interpretation of the original. No singing here! The acting was good, I liked DG's ""sleepy"" performance and I loved Alan Cumming's Scarecrow character. I also love the fact that the Pretender writers wrote so many parallels to their previous show. Jarod could be seen in the Tin Man, searching for his family, the Sorceress was like a Miss Parker recast, and the lion had empath powers just like Angelo. I suppose the Scarecrow could have been a Sydney/Broots mix. Other minor parallel characters made appearances as well and this mini series was like a blending of The Pretender and the Wizard of OZ.

3288975,5,B0010X744G,"I agree this is a brilliant re-imagining of the original Wizard of OZ. There are such masterful turns and metaphors that take time to figure out long after viewing. For instance, it took me time to realize that the Grey Gale referred to the original version which was in sepia and when DG encounters Dorothy  Gale she is in black and white with the exception of her slippers and the red 39 on the heart outside the farmhouse (referring back to the original year the Wizard of Oz was made)--but the Dorothy Gale that DG found was gray (the gray gale). Also the way that Emerald City gets reused as the quest for the Emerald and power. Alot of people have questioned the title of the mini-series because the tin man wasn't the central character but I think that the tin man becomes a metaphor for the way that each character is locked in their own prison helplessly watching as destruction seems to fill their lives and they fight to get out of those prisons. The end was a bit schmaltzy for my taste -- all the twists and turns in the plot kept me hopping so I was expecting a bit more of bang. I thought the performances were first-rate and the difficulty of taking an overly dramatic musical and turning it into a drama that was believable and not overblown was key--I think Zooey Deschanel's DG was spot on in having the right amount of sarcasm and bewilderment and she really pulled you into the story. I am awaiting the DVD--it will be refreshing to watch it in one sitting instead of across three nights. Other critics have been less than generous to this effort but it isn't the sort of thing that one grabs at one sitting--it really does require that you think back to the details of the original as well as become involved in a new world. I can't say enough good things about Tin man. It is so smart on so many levels that I think it flew over so many critics heads and they just didn't want to spend the time to figure out how the plot grabbed so many details from the Wizard of Oz and used them to tell a whole new story.

But, by the time I finished the first third (it was a three part mini-series), and started the second third from my DVR, I was TOTALLY hooked.  I couldn't get to the second third of it fast enough.  It is an excellent adaptation.  I can't wait for the DVD.  I am a HUGE fan of adaptations with a twist, and this was definately a good book adaptation.  I watched all 6 hours of it in one night.  It was amazing.  WELL worth the time to watch it.  Though the ending was a little bit predictible, especially once you learn what happened to the girls, but it is still VERY well acted, and VERY well put together.

Anyway, I REALLY enjoyed this movie, which is why I gave it five stars. The acting was great, the characters flawless. However, I found the ending unsatisfying. I understand there were time constraints, but the movie just kind of ended abruptly with no satisfying tying together of all the plot-lines (like Glitch getting his brain back and Cain and his son finding closure with Adora's death and Zero, to name just a couple). The movie would have been better had it spent a bit of time actually tying everything up. I'm one of those people who, when a story ends, likes to see all the loose ends tied up nice and tidy. That's why I personally LOVED the ending to the Lord of the Rings movies. Everything was tied up beautifully.

In the making you see a lot of that scene and Cain shutting down the device. And they talk about alot of storyline they had to cut out. I hope they put that back in or at least put it on the DVD when it gloriously comes out. I know I'm already in line for it.

Tin Man was very well written to provide a different twist into the story of OZ and then tie it back to the orginal. The cinematography and special effects put the requisite 'bigger than life' feel to this story, and the casting and acting couldn't have been better. This was the first time I've seen Zooey Deschanel at work and her visual expressions coupled with her down-to-earth acting made this story really come together.

3288992,5,B0010X744G,"Anyone looking for a remake should turn the other direction. Instead what you get is a TRULY FANTASTIC movie that plays as a sequel of sorts to the original classic. This is a twisted, wonderful, and very unique spin to the Wizard of Oz. I stress that this is NOT a remake, but an original plot with elements of the original story thrown in.

Be patient. It does have a slow start, but keep watching, and you will be amazed. With its darker vibe, I would not recommend it for younger audiences, but adults should be enthralled. Great ""character"" acting and wonderful imagination top it off. Alan Cumming does an excellent job as Glitch, the brainless sidekick. Neal McDonough is perfect in the masculine role of a ""Tin Man"". Kathleen Robertson is also perfection as the wicked Azkadellia.

The DVD lacks a bit with special features, but the enhanced graphics and sound make it worth the purchase.

With a reported budget just under $20 million for a six-hour made-for-TV Movie, my kudos go out to the special effects team. It's no movie fare (this is Sci-Fi), but it certainly is eye-catching; really something to see. Standouts are ""Central City"" and the ""Ice Palace"".

This is pure entertainment for those with lengthy and active imaginations.

I highly recommend this for all sci-fi and fantasy lovers!

If there is one flaw, it's the ending. It tied up the basic loose end, but not everything, and I suspect a sequel is in the works. Considering the record breaking ratings, I would hope!

3288999,5,B0010X744G,"If you are expecting ruby slippers and a cackling green lady, you are in for an awakening of your own.  Growing up with singing munchkins, I realized, hey, I am a grownup.  And SciFi seemed to realize it too with a magnificent departure from the 1939 MGM film to a brilliant, futuristic, decadent, and sometimes apocalyptic telling.  The reinventions of characters and fantastical sets soon transport you from the familiar to a place you find yourself hard to take your eyes off of-- from phosphorous-glowing trees, desolate paths, Metropolitan-like art deco palaces, and underworlds unlike anything and then again reminiscent of a certain alphabet city pre-Rudy.

The story itself is not for the kiddies.  Mine were told continuously to leave the room, go play, and find something else to do.  But the grown up fairy tale is long overdue.  The story actually had twists, turns, and menacing meaning-- much more substance and meaning than the trifles the network and cable gurus seem to thrust down our throats.

I honestly cannot wait until the DVD comes out to feast my peepers on the rich masterpiece SciFi laid out for the holidays.  (A much better smorgasborg than the Cheeto-fare of Lifetime).

And for just desserts-- SciFi scored an incredible coup with incredibly gifted actors perfectly tailored for each role-- most notably Alan Cumming for Glitch, Neal McDonough as the titular Tin Man, and the remarkable ""evil"" Azkadelia played by Kathleen Robertson.

Evil no longer is a personality trait to just carry a plot, but in this series, actually has a real beginning, reason to exist, and a true part in throughout the series up to the climatic end.  This series is like a force of nature that I found myself carried away in-- somewhat like DG.",1197244800,209,1753,4.925170068027211

8239162,5,B0010X744G,"This well made for TV mini-series Directed by Nick Willing will hold your attention from the beginning. All the actors were well chosen and Zooey Deschanel as DG will enchant you. At first it seems like any other contemporary contrived script that was just using a snappy title. Then you think this is Smallville and where is Clark? Then slowly the story unfolds and before you realize hat has happened you are caught up in the intrigue of a complex story with all of the elements found in Frank Baum's original story but actually better designed. The film, even though being promoted as the darker side of OZ, in reality is just a little more down to earth or up in the sky fairy tale.

DG grows up in a rural town by elderly loving parents. There she is a waitress tat is contemplating of going out into the wide world. She has strange dreams of another world. Before her parents can tell her, the other world becomes a reality and DG becomes the target or key to an insidious plot to destroy the O.Z.",1512000000,2,1003,4.421621621621622
