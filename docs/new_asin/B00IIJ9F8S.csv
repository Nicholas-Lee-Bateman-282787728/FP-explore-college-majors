8642348,1,B00IIJ9F8S,"The movies included are great, but this economy edition includes an incredibly annoying amount of outdated trailers loaded at the front of each disc. You cannot skip or fast-forward and they play every time. If you're the type who watches movies over and over, this gets old real fast. It was so bad we chucked this set in the trash, would actually rather replace each movie on Bluray for twice the cost each if it means no forced ads.",1493683200,,435,4.518987341772152
8642349,2,B00IIJ9F8S,"Looks like a cheap chinese bootleg, for the price I guess I can't complain too much. At least it played. Picture looks zoomed in, footage is blurry and grainy even for SD. DVD setup menu didn't work.",1490140800,,199,4.405405405405405
