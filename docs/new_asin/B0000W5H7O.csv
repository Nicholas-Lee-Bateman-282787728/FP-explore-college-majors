8003986,4,B0000W5H7O,"I liked this movie better than ""The Blob"" even though I'm a fan of Steve McQueen.  I think this movie is more of an adult ""blob"" movie whereas ""The Blob"" to me was aiming more at the teenage market.  I liked the music score as it seemed to enhance the suspense as it would build to climax after climax... :)  ""X-the Unknown"" is definitely worthy of inclusion in your horror/science fiction collection.  The other half of this double feature didn't impress me.  I only bought this DVD to get ""X-the Unknown"".  ""Four Sided Triangle"" I found to be a yawner and I fell asleep after about 15 minutes of it.  (besides, I have all the Frankenstein movies I need!)  The price was a little steep, I think, but I paid it to get ""X-the Unknown"".",1299196800,,734,4.385185185185185
8003987,5,B0000W5H7O,"Kudos to Anchor Bay Entertainment for restoring these two black and white classic science fiction horror films from Hammer.  Both have audio and video that are sharp and pristine.  They are presented in full frame which is how they must have appeared in the theatres because the credits are not chopped off.  Both have exclusive ""World of Hammer"" episodes but I never watch them because they contain too many plot spoilers.  Only ""X the Unknown"" has a theatrical trailer.

  ""Four Sided Triangle"" is a modern Frankenstein type film.  Two geeky scientists create a reproducer that can duplicate anything that is mineral, vegetable or animal.  One of them, Robin, has a beautiful girlfriend, Lena.  Bill becomes exceedingly jealous when Robin and Lena are married.  Lena allows Bill to use her to create a duplicate.  As always, there are tragic consequences whenever men play God.

  ""X The Unknown"" is similar to ""The Blob.""  Instead of blood, the creature in ""X The Unknown"" must feed on radiation.  It will destroy anyone who crosses its path.  At first, it gives it victims severe radiation burns that eventually kill them.  As it feeds on radiation, it continues to grow bigger and stronger until it is literally melting the flesh off its victims.  Can an atomic scientist, Dr. Royston (Dean Jagger), stop it before it destroys all of mankind?

  ""X The Unknown"" is definitely the more terrifying of the two features.  It contains more carnage and mayhem as the blob-like creature menaces an entire village.  It is very much along the vein of the famous Quatermass series:  ""Quatermass Xperiment,"" ""Quatermass 2"" and ""Quatermass and the Pit.""  I bought this double feature primarily for ""X The Unknown"" and considered ""Four Sided Triangle"" a bonus film which contains less horror and more romance.  This package is highly recommended for fans of Hammer films.",1243641600,,1863,5.019672131147541
8003988,4,B0000W5H7O,"This Hammer Studios double feature is well-worth seeking out if you're a fan of Brit horror and/or science fiction.

""X"" THE UNKNOWN is England's answer to ""The Blob."" Dean Jagger stars as an American atomic research scientist working over in England who, in his spare time, is attempting to perfect a method of electronically neutralizing radioactivity. His efforts have thus far proved fruitless. Then one afternoon things get decidedly more exciting when the town where Jagger works has an unusual visitor: a sentient lifeform from the bowels of the earth, which has suddenly decided to come topside and pay a visit ...and re-establish itself as supreme ruler of the surface world! Dean and his Brit pals, (the eternally wonderful Leo McKern among them), soon find themselves in some extremely deep dookey when the thing gets a bit hungry - and starts dissolving everyone in sight. Now Dean's gotta use his noodle to solve a fairly unique problem: how do you kill a large mass of angry, wet dirt AND do it without blowing up the Earth? ""X"" is an engrossing, intelligently-written, well-acted horror actioner, with some exceptional chills & thrills and some pretty decent for the time gore F/X shots. It really entertains, which is no small feat since it's essentially a film about killer mud. :-D

FOUR-SIDED TRIANGLE isn't bad but it's not great either. Basic plot revolves around a scientist who has the hots for this one chick but she's all about some other guy.  So... Mr. Science decides to clone her in order to have a copy for himself. Problem solved, right? Well, not quite since his new clone girlfriend goes and falls for the other guy too. Whoops! What's a lonely mad scientist to do? Think of this movie as an old school Chick Flick with mild sci-fi overtones.

Thankfully, these Hammer double bill releases are on separate discs, not those crappy flipper disc jobs so many other outfits (cough*MGM & Universal*cough) are using for many of their double feature releases. The video & audio quality on both films are very good, especially considering the ages of the respective films. EDIT: Tragically, this double bill release is now OOP (out of print) so you'll have to pay out the wazoo if you want a copy. I should have bought a dozen DVDs, kept one for myself and sold the rest!  Bummer. Hopefully this set will be re-issued one day. Or better yet, remastered in Blu-ray format!  5 STARS for ""X"" and 3 STARS for Four-Sided Triangle.",1241913600,,2450,4.821428571428571

8003990,4,B0000W5H7O,"If you remember way back when, you will appreciate the availability of the Hammer movies.  These movies were shown infrequently and truthfully I never saw the Four Sided Triangle before. I'm not a film critic so I won't go there. Enjoyed them both.  I would love to get my hands on Quartermass and the Pit on DVD.",1190764800,,313,4.473684210526316
8003991,4,B0000W5H7O,"I purchased this with just reviews and a general understanding of the movies. I was pleasantly suprised. Four Sided Triangle is an interesting story on cloning and the obligitory warnings of playing God. Pretty good acting and original story. Not a lot for true ""horror"" but a good sci fi movie none the less. Special effects were interesting and relates to what was seen in the original ""The Fly"". As for X The Unknown you will be reminded of ""The Blob"" although you need to remember that X came out a year previous. The idea is releatively the same. A bunch of goo terrorizes a local area. Although The Blob has been shredded by some, I think it is still a good movie. X rates up there as well. It is in black and white which true ""old"" movie fans will appreciate. The acting is solid and the story is interesting and will keep your attention. A worth while twosome to add to your collection.",1140566400,20,894,4.424242424242424

8003993,4,B0000W5H7O,"Anchor Bay Entertainment has begun releasing the lesser-known Hammer films in an economical 'two-fer' format, following behind MGM and their 'Midnight Movies' format.  That's great news for those of us who haven't gotten around to purchasing these films individually, as they were originally offered, but bad news from those who have already bought the films when they were originally released to DVD in the single movie format at full price.  The discs and special features offered though this set are the same as when they were offered in a single disc format, but now they are two for the price of one.  I can't help but wonder if the original releases weren't selling very well, so Anchor Bay recovered them and re-released them in this more economical 'limited edition' sets.  Who knows?
Anyway, the first film, The Four Sided Triangle (1953) is a decent melodramatic science fiction thriller dealing with, what I figure was a relatively new concept at the time, of human cloning.  The story involves mainly three individuals, Bill, Robin, and Lena.  Bill, coming from a solid background and a wealthy family, is the practical one, while Robin is the flipside of the coin, coming from a poor family, exhibits the dreamer-like qualities of a true visionary, but also suffers the highs and lows of what could be considered a manic-depressive personality.  Lena is sort of in the middle, obviously desired by both men, although she can only choose one.
The men, fresh back from college, develop a machine that can perfectly reproduce anything, and this opens up a wealth of possible opportunities, and also allows Bill to profess his love to Lena, prompting their marriage, much to Robin's dismay.  Robin, bored with the practical applications of the machine already, looks towards new frontiers of duplicating organic matter, and decides one the process is perfected, he should like to duplicate Lena.  It works, but not without complications.  All in all, not a bad movie, and it seems pretty original for the time, even though it does borrow from the Frankenstein mythos a little bit.  The film is slow moving, so patience is required.  The surprise ending seemed a bit contrived and fantastical, but the production values were pretty good, making for an interesting, if drawn out, experience.
X - The Unknown (1957) is the much better of the two films here, presenting a very intelligent and wonderful science fiction story that presents the notion of an ancient life form that lives within the Earth and rises through a fissure, seeking out sustenance in the form of radioactive materials.  Dean Jagger stars and presents a thoroughly likable character surrounded by a strong supporting cast.  Some of the horror elements were quite a bit more visceral that I would have expected, but made for fun and interesting viewing leading up to a suitably climatic finish.
I really liked the notion that the creature, a giant blob of inky, gooey material, wasn't from outer space, but something that has been on this terrestrial plane for a long time, much longer than man.  I also appreciated the complications that developed as the characters discerned information about the creature, providing real depth to the story, and elevating this film above the average 'creature feature'.
Both films look and sound great, with minimal deterioration present in the prints provided, and contain the special features related to their original, independent releases, with The Four Sided Triangle disc containing a Hammer World of Horror episode titled The Curse of Frankenstein and X- The Unknown disc the World of Horror episode titled Sci-Fi and an original trailer for the film.  Also included in the case are two reproduction cards for promotional material on each film.  A great value if you are coming in late in the game, and it does say limited edition on the front of the case, so supplies may be limited.

8003994,5,B0000W5H7O,"""X - The Unknown"" rests squarely in the ""Quatermass"" camp of an intelligent scientist facing off with the British military against a bizarre threat to humanity. The movie was specifically made to follow-up on the commercial success (and critical acclaim) of the very first ""Quatermass"" movie (""The Quatermass Xperiment) made just the year before. American actor Dean Jagger (probably best known for his role as ""General Waverly"" in ""White Christmas"") plays the ""Quatermass"" character (here named Dr. Adam Royston), called in to investigate when an Army unit doing geiger-counter training exercises witnesses an earthquake and the opening of an apparently bottomless fissure. (Another tidbit - his investigative partner, police inspector McGill, is played by the most well-known of ""The Prisoner""'s Number Twos, Leo McKern!) Soon afterwards (as is always the case) there's death and destruction, and Royston has to come up with something to neutralize the menace of a creeping, radioactive blob. (The American ""The Blob"" wouldn't show up for two more years.) Gruesome (for their time) special effects of melting and smoking flesh raise this apart from more timid US efforts of the day, and the soundtrack is by ""Quatermass"" composer James Bernard. Extraordinarliy atmospheric, filmed almost entirely at night with authentic-feeling Scottish locations, a terrific and over-looked classic from Hammer.
But wait! There's more! Watching the opening of ""The Four-Sided Triangle"", and you will be forgiven if you think immediately of ""How Green Was My Valley"". We're treated to a nostalgic look at a small English village, with a winsome voice-over by the town ""Doc"" (played by James Hayter, seen in ""Oliver!"" as well as a few ""Avengers"" shows). Doc tells us the story of three children, two boys and the girl they both loved. The girl (Lena) grows up to be Barbara Payton (""Bride of the Gorilla""), and the two boys Robin and Bill (John Van Eyssen and Stephen Murray) are inventors both still under her spell. She (finally!) decides on.....Robin, but Bill isn't willing to leave it at that. With the help of a ""replicator"", he creates a perfect duplicate of Lena. Too perfect, it seems, because even the duplicate prefers Robin! VERY good acting, much better than we usually see in this kind of movie. And the music is by classical composer Malcolm Arnold!
These two discs show British science fiction at its best (well, except for ""Quatermass"" ;-) and are a bargain at this price. I recommend them most highly!",1075680000,31,2504,5.169950738916256
