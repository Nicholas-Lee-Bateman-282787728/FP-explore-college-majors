An Amazon reviewer by the name of grateful user left a review about this DVD collection on October 9, 2012. The review states: ""Either this disk was used and abused, or is it as copy of a copy of a copy... Terrible quality."" So far, I have viewed three of the feature length movies and five of the short films. I have also spot checked the rest of them. This is a two disc set containing eight feature movies and seven short films. That is a lot of information crammed onto each disc and frankly, I wasn't expecting much in the way of quality. I made the purchase regardless, and was delightfully surprise. The quality was quite nice, and far exceeded my expectations. Grateful user must be a ""tougher grader"" than I am, or I must be easily pleased. So, in matters of quality, I guess only you can be the judge.",1349395200,55,3106,4.645985401459854
