2400464,5,B000B5XOS4,"It is a MUST to see!!!  Hilarious all the way!!!
We think Harold Lloyd is the best of all the comedians.
To us 1st. Harold Lloyd, 2nd Buster Keaton, 3rd. Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy.
Cornelia Strohmeier of San Jose, CA",1396656000,,227,4.404761904761905
2400465,5,B000B5XOS4,Lloyd delights all ages with his antics and cliffhanger comedy. He's one of the greats ever to shine on the silver screen. I enjoy him better than Keaton and Chaplin. Lloyd is in a class by himself.,1396051200,,198,4.378378378378378
2400466,4,B000B5XOS4,"Volume 3 is a must have for Lloyd fans, but it is the least of the 3.  But it still better than almost any comparable comedy collection!  Great shorts (Haunted Spooks is included), & Hot Water is one of the feature films, but Volume #1 has Safety Last, Girl Shy, & Why Worry, & Volume 2 has The Kid Brother, The Freshman, & Grandma's Boy.  Great quality DVD with lots of extras.",1364083200,4,378,4.222222222222222
2400467,5,B000B5XOS4,"I like this the most of Lloyd's picures . It was fascinating to see ""old "" New York and Coney Island",1362441600,,100,3.8095238095238093
2400468,5,B000B5XOS4,"I got this set because one of my favorite silent comedies ""Speedy"" was on it.  It is truly a comedy gem.  So are so many of the others in this terrific collection.  If you are not already a fan of Harold Lloyd, you will be after watching these.",1327017600,5,244,4.041666666666667
2400469,5,B000B5XOS4,"Volume 3 of this collection will entertain you and your children for hours.  We have children ages 6, 12 and 15 and they all thought these Lloyd movies were funny.  The two adults in the family thought so too, but we also marveled at the overall excellence of the videos.  Lloyd was a comic genius, though many people have forgotten that.  His sight gags are often extended pieces that build up to a climax -- not just a ten second bit but one that may last several minutes.  The photography in the most famous movie here, Speedy, is astounding for its time -- and the movie gives a great historical perspective on what New York looked like at the time -- both in panorama form and on-the-street perspective.  The Babe Ruth bit is funny, but the whole movie is superior all the way through.  The chase scenes through busy NYC streets are incredible.  The character actors used form this era are gems.  ""Hot Water"" is a gem, with great comic acting by the cast, extended gags, and a final scene that brings together several themes in the movie in a comedic climax.  Some of the stunts in the movies are breath taking.  Lloyd said in an interview with Harry Reasoner (available to view on You Tube) that he did his own stunts and that in fact he was in dangerous situations in some scenes.  It sure looks like Lloyd was ""performing without a net"" in some of the scenes.  I was only vaguely familiar with Lloyd, but after seeing this one volume I am putting him right up there with Chaplin for creativity.  Also, Lloyd is someone who you can identify with as he undergoes his travails.",1326240000,7,1582,4.466898954703833
2400470,5,B000B5XOS4,"This was purchased for the Library's DVD collection.

It is popular and is checked out often.  Harold Lloyd was a genius and his comedies are legendary.",1295395200,,152,4.8076923076923075
2400471,4,B000B5XOS4,Enjoyed seeing what life was like so many years ago. Movies as our great grandparents would have seen them. A world that has long since disappeared.,1242345600,3,148,4.730769230769231
2400472,5,B000B5XOS4,"Speedy, one of the 3 films included is an essential document of old New York.  Coney Island, old Pennsylvania Station (exterior), street scenes and street cars and more.  Its all magnificently restored to pristine quality.  The story told is also performed well by a master of the silent screen.  The 2 other films are similarly restored and performed, but the magnificence of speedy's capture of New York stands out as one of the best documents of the early filmed city (along with various short subjects documenting the city such as those by Edison's studio).  Thank you for finally releasing this on DVD.",1217635200,17,607,4.911764705882353
