7796950,5,1568555989,This is a great video and very informative. If you want to learn what is happening now and in these last days this is a must see video. This is one of the best christian documentarys I have ever seen.,1299283200,2,200,4.025
7796951,1,1568555989,This is completely bonkers - the kind of thing that would make Christianity a laughing stock were its political implications not so sinister.,1136592000,5,141,5.173913043478261

If you would like to know more just check out Matthew:24, Revelation:13, and 2 Thessalonians:2.",1087257600,8,245,4.857142857142857
7796953,5,1568555989,"If you're trying to explain the End Times (i.e., the 7-year Tribulation, 3.5-year Great Tribulation) to your family, friends or associates, you won't find a better video than this one. Includes running commentary by Dr. Ed Hindson, Dr. Thomas Ice, Dr. Larry Poland and Dr. Tim LaHaye. Excellent presentation of material, news and documentary footage, plus state-of-the-art graphics and special effects. Wish there had been a DVD version for easy access to chapters.
Actually the only doctrinal issue that I would differ with is LaHaye's statement of the world's population by mid-trib whereas I would say the Scriptures more accurately presents this figure at the end of the Tribulation. Don't let this keep you from ordering the video.
They really did their homework to come up with a decent presentation on this topic and spent the money for terrific production values. I recommend it especially to pastors who are trying to quickly get their church ""up to speed"" on these issues. This has to be one of the best videos on this subject ever produced. No drama, just Bible prophecy presented with news footage plus a few actors to portray some of the main characters.
Too bad they didn't note that Moslems had planted a graveyard in front of the Eastern Gate of Jerusalem during the Turkish rule. Knowing that the Messiah, Christ, would have to qualify as a Levite priest, they walled up the Eastern Gate and planted a graveyard in front of it. Levite priests are forbidden by Scripture to go through a graveyard. Somehow, I don't think this will be a problem for Him! (there are a lot of shots of the Eastern Gate of Jerusalem, with the graveyard in front of it, in this movie).
Get the movie and show it to your family and friends!",1030060800,27,1733,4.78
7796954,3,1568555989,"Not bad to watch, if you are not aware of the signs leading to and during the end times.  I've already looked into the end of the age more thoroughly thru Bible prophecy, also while listening to Christian radio and it didn't  really present me with anything I didn't already know.  I was hoping that  this video would use more computer generated animation to act out what  might occur during the rapture and tribulation period according to the  scriptures.  It does present the rule of the anti-Christ well using live  action and computer graphics and it has plenty of scenes of wars throughout  the world at various time periods in the 20th century.  In conclusion, it's  good to present this to an unbelieving friend, but if you are a devout  Christian, it's a bit slow.",959126400,16,772,4.637037037037037
