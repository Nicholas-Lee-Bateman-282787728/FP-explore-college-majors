5402018,2,B00AA0LDT2,"Don't like the setting of the video, its dark and hard to see...
Don't like the moves or the sequences...
Not inspiring and I love dance...
Not worth the money!",1361836800,3,160,4.366666666666666
5402019,4,B00AA0LDT2,"I have only done the first and the third DVDs, but I absolutely love them! The dance dvd is very challenging at first and takes a lot of concentration to get the steps down. But once you do it is a fabulous workout!! I find I am focusing so much on the moves that the time goes by very fast!
These are not good dvds if you are just starting out. I would suggest these dvds for the person that already works out, but wants to try something new and challenging. I consider myself in decent shape and I have been working out via running, biking, the gym and Tai-bo 3 to 4 times a week for the last 15 years and these dance dvds really kick my butt! (C'mon, we didn't expect a workout from Madonna to be easy did we?)

It is a great set to do if you want to kick up your work out to the next level. I love it because I feel I am challenging my cardio, stamina and muscles even more. And I swear my thighs seemed to thin down after consistently doing the first DVD twice a week in addition my other work outs.  Also, a bonus is that Nicole has a very pleasant personality. Its hard to do a work out dvd if the instructor annoys you(as many do annoy me). But she is very likeable and easy to listen to and watch.",1361059200,10,1206,3.979338842975207
5402020,4,B00AA0LDT2,"I work out a lot!! These discs give a great quick heart pumping workout...my only complaint is the format. I think the tutorial should be first, instead she warms you up, then gives the tutorial (which is good, offering alignment cues & modifications), but by the time that is done, you are cooled down, just reversing the order make sit so much better",1358035200,20,352,4.603174603174603
5402021,4,B00AA0LDT2,"Disclaimer: I've only worked my way through the first 2 DVD's, so my opinion may change later!

Pros: I love the music! And Nicole Winhoffer is not annoying; I actually like her.

DVD 1: Though I have rhythm and like to dance, I'm not a ""dancer"" dancer. It took me a couple mind-boggling (and at times exasperating) sessions to get each of the dance moves down, but now that I know the routines, it doesn't feel like exercise--just fun. I get my sweat on and my heart rate up without even realizing it. Each routine (minus the instruction) is only about 10 minutes, which is a bit short for me, but I just keep repeating the routines to get my full hour workout.

DVD 2: Fun, crazy, and challenging. I can definitely feel my arm muscles. I haven't perfected this one yet, but it feels good to make progress. (Um, the splits? Yeow!!)

Cons: I have wood floors and can't imagine doing this workout on carpet. So if you have carpet only, I'm not sure I'd bother (you'll likely wear a hole in the carpet and/or work up so much static, you'll be shocking every person you touch all day). I'm hesitant about the chair workout because all my chairs are upholstered, flimsy plastic, or wood, and I don't want to subject any of those to my scuffy shoes or full, sweaty weight. I may have to buy a chair specifically for that DVD.",1357257600,35,1320,4.397540983606557

5402024,5,B00AA0LDT2,I haven't completed all 4 dvds yet but I love the workouts so far. The music is very upbeat and dancing beats crunches any day! It's the only workout series in my collection that I actually wake up and look forward to doing.,1374710400,2,224,4.232558139534884
5402025,4,B00AA0LDT2,This video series is like taking a dance class from a tough good teacher. So far I love it. But this series is not for the uncoordinated.,1374537600,4,137,4.111111111111111

5402028,1,B00AA0LDT2,"The worst exercise DVDs I have ever purchased.

I wouldn't  recommend these to anyone.",1369526400,2,178,4.5625
5402029,3,B00AA0LDT2,One has to have some background in dancing. Be prepared to sweat a lot. It can be hard to follow but stay with it if you want to look like Madonna.,1369008000,,147,3.774193548387097
5402030,1,B00AA0LDT2,This was not what i expected. If you are not already in pretty good shape this series will not work for you. The first and third tapes are basically learning a dance routine and you do it over and over. The second take which is an actual exercise tape is so over the top you need to already be in good condition to even attempt it. I didn't review the fourth tape.,1364428800,7,364,4.069444444444445

8548866,2,B00AA0LDT2,"If you aren't already in really good shape, forget it. This is definitely not for beginners (people new to exercise or DANCE), or for people with a lot of weight to lose (or just bad joints). You need a LOT of stamina and strength to do these workouts, seriously. One of the DVDs has you basically planking the entire time. That's not why I rated 2 stars, though. If it wants to be a tough workout series that's great. But I do have legitimate complaints.

1 The dance workouts (2 of the DVDs) are horribly lit. These are challenging high-energy routines. It's hard enough for me to keep up without having to also play Where's Waldo to see what the instructor is doing. The set looks like an abandoned warehouse that is totally dark except for one big spotlight shining straight down on the middle of the floor. Cool idea but the execution is botched. The instructor spends 90% of the time in the DARK part of the room, and when she does come into the light, she stays at the very edge, and only for a quick second before she retreats back into darkness like a vampire. It's so dumb. To make things worse, in nearly all of the routines she is wearing a mostly black outfit and in some of the routines she's wearing ALL black. Like, come ON. I can't frigging see anything but little glints of light bouncing off her ponytail..

2. If you only have a carpeted area to work out, the upper-body-focus DVDs will be useless for you. The way it works is that you basically plank (get in a push-up position) the entire time and have small towels under each foot. You then use your toweled feet to slide around, and to ""run' against the floor. This is an incredible workout - too much for me if I'm being honest - but it would be completely impossible to do this on carpet. You need a hard floor or your feet can't glide around.

3. The final DVD is lower-body-focus, and it requires a chair, and it better be an extremely stable, sturdy and strong chair. You will not be simply using this for balance while you do calf raises, oh no. You will be getting up and standing on this chair while you do kicks and things, at a kinda-fast pace. If you don't have a safe chair you could get very hurt.

Criticisms 2 and 3 may not seem fair but it's too inconvenient for me to consider it a good home workout. You should be able to do it (SAFELY) in an average home. Many people, especially apartment dwellers, do not have hard floors, so that's one useless DVD; and how many people have a really strong sturdy chair at home? Dining chairs don't count because they tend to have narrow backs (and padded seats) and you need a chair with a wide back to do the routine safely and effectively. In the video, the instructor uses a chair that resembles an extra-wide seat (no cushion) that you'd find in a waiting room or something, but of course hers is made of metal so it doesn't slide around or buckle or do anything dangerous like a plastic waiting-room chair might do - it's just not the typical type of chair people are going to have at home. So that's another DVD that is potentially useless to the consumer.

Getting through these DVDs made me wish I lived in a place where Madonna's Hard Candy gyms are located (and that I could afford to join), because I would take the classes. These routines would be great to do in a gym, with an instructor and without the idiotic mood lighting. I just don't think the two floor-routine DVDs work very well for home - not for most people. And the lighting in the 2 dance DVDs is simply inexcusable.",1406160000,6,3522,4.354642313546423
8548867,4,B00AA0LDT2,"I used to hate cardio, but this workout is fun.  Dancing along with Nicole is challenging, but in a way that doesn't feel like the same old boring workout videos I have purchased in the past.  I actually look forward to doing these videos.",1398643200,,239,4.409090909090909
8548868,5,B00AA0LDT2,It's a perfect work out for me. doesn't have a lot of stuff I cannot do b/c of my balance problems. Will keep using it as I try to get rid of this weight.,1398384000,,154,3.5588235294117645
8548869,1,B00AA0LDT2,"You would think after you learn the steps you would go into the routine, but instead you have to jump around the disc to find the routine connected to what you just learned & the ""instructor"" just performs it. Stick to Shaun T if you want a good, instructive video. In addition some of the workouts requires a slippery floor surface or hard plastic mat thing to slide on... would have been good to know this before I bought it. The seller was good, but these videos stink compared to others.",1397347200,,491,4.406593406593407
