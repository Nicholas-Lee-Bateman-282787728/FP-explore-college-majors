8456123,5,B00542PTAA,I always disgusted the royal family during Diana's living years because of their treatment of her and it just gets worse in death.  I honestly don't know how those 2 boys cannot be asking questions. It is gross to think of the way that Henri Paul has been SO defamed. What is even more sickening is that the royal family are trying to ban this film.  I really feel that there should be NO place in society for the British royal family. They are not human.,1382745600,,455,4.27906976744186
8456124,4,B00542PTAA,"Oddly enough I only became aware of the whole Diana conspiracy theories by listening to Howard Stern the day he interviewed the father of Dodi, years after the interview. I have to say it's fascinating and probably true that Diana's death was not simply an auto accident. I've read that ""car crashes"" are pretty standard MO for deaths of well known and controversial figures around the world for what it's worth.

_______________________________________________
Pros about the movie:
-There was an actual letter where Diana stated that she feared that she would be killed in a car ""accident"" and that it would be at the behest of the the Royal Family. Amazing!
-Lots of good Diana footage where she states her views of the royal family and what she thought they thought of her.
-Lots of very suspicious FACTS that surrounded both the crash and the aftermath are compelling and would make any reasonable person suspicious of the version of the verdict that was broadcast by the British and world media.
-The French government has refused any access to the Dr's that treated Diana at the crash site and the ambulance ride stating that it was in the interest of national security to forbid it.
-Diana was under surveillance by British, American and French intelligence. Not really a surprise but none of the information on that surveillance has ever been released.
-The Queen actually DID strip Diana of her titles! Incredible!
-I could actually see how the Royal Family didn't want Diana possibly marrying a Muslim as Prince Phillip does seem and look like a real Nazi sympathizing scumbag. I read his mother was schizophrenic. And no one who looks at Charles could think he's an OK guy, yuk.
-The mysterious death of a photo journalist who said he was there, in the white Fiat, and took pictures. Although he was shown in footage smoking a cigar in his white Fiat, so this would perhaps explain why his body was burned in his car. If he killed himself with two bullets to the head, and yes that's possible, it would be possible he had a lit cigar in the car with him at the time. Of course the keys were never found and the doors were locked, so it's too fishy for me to be a suicide.
-The sneaky and typically British subtle, dry wording of the verdict, i.e. ""it was unlawful killing by the following cars"", NOT necessarily the reporters who were following her just following cars! The film states that Diana's car left the paparazzi well behind by the time they were even close to the tunnel and that motorcycles as well as the white Fiat were seen entering the tunnel at the same time.
-NONE of the street CCTV cameras captured ANY of the cars movement anywhere near the tunnel, that's crazy!
-MANY other details and facts that are compelling and puzzling.
_______________________________________________
The Bad
-The ""undercover"" journalist part is a bit silly and overwrought, we get it the British press is both actively and passively in the Royals pocket. I think the various BBC scandals over the last few years have shown that.
-I didn't really like the snarky music video sections overlayed with various images, not all are even of Diana.
-I think the Howard Stern thing was really kind of a joke on Dodi's father. Someone must have told him that Stern is taken seriously as far as in depth news about things like this. He's not, his show is FUNNY, that's it. I think it was pretty silly to put that edited on-air interview in there.
-A lot of the people interviewed look a little off to me and some, notably the actual filmmaker, look positively disheveled and scrappy.
-Too much needless innuendo, sinister voice type of stuff as well as silly stuff like pointing out that the jurors rolling court aka bus got a flat while in Paris etc.
-The silly parts about Dodi included because his father bankrolled this whole film don't help its goal of being taken as serious fare. I'm not diminishing his death but they could have toned down that stuff, this is all about Diana's death really not so much about a playboys.
____________________________________________________________

-I'm undecided about the whole land mine thing. Yes Diana was campaigning against outlawing them just before a crucial international meeting to ban them took place. And President Clinton did support her before BUT did vote AGAINST the ban in the end and was the only western leader to do so although then that means the British leader did then right? I'm not so sure that's really much of a driving force for her murder though.
-This film really makes you think differently about modern England and the REAL power the Royals have over a LOT of the political and legal establishment and thus over England as a whole. I no longer think the Royals are simply figureheads but they do actually run the vast majority of the country as real rulers. I feel it's a convenient myth presented to the world by the British elite that it is a real democracy. The British are just so well trained, it comes natural to them to obey everything they are told by the British elite, reminds me of how terrified and harried the servants are in Downton Abbey but no one seems to notice that.
-The fact that this film can't even get distribution in AMERICA and certainly not in England is a really VERY damning thing.

In short, yes I do believe she was murdered at the behest of the British Royals and it has been covered up successfully. I think this was done so Charles could marry a ""proper"" subject as well as to extinguish the possibility of Diana marrying and maybe even having a child with a Muslim or some other undesirable in the eyes of the Royals. Also that she was too much of a loose cannon free spirit, totally unlike the Windsors: she endangered their image. Do you know how sweet the Royals have it? They carefully craft this image worldwide as figureheads only, with no real power so no real controversy ever has come up involving them in regards the actions of the British government as controlled by them using patronage(lordships etc) informally to ALL of Britains on-the-record decision makers! Brilliant! In the USA politicians, military officials and presidents are constantly in trouble over their decisions but I've NEVER heard anything of the sort across the pond. I'd argue that the British Royals are more powerful than any President has ever and could ever be. Thank God for 1776.",1372896000,2,6374,4.745716862037872
8456125,5,B00542PTAA,"I saw this movie at a screening in LA, probably in 2010, and was shocked by the quantity of evidence provided for a killing and cover-up.  I am still surprised that such a large quantity of leads has not resulted in a reopening of an investigation.

The remainder of this post is excerpted from a review/summary that supports my recollections of the documentary.  It was written by ""The Rebel of Oz"" and copied on 23 May 2013 from http://therebel.org/editorials-sorted-by-title/587825-the-unlawful-killing-of-princess-diana-and-dodi-al-fayed.  I deleted paragraphs containing the author's opinions and describing the legal demands for takedown of the documentary from that site.

_________________________________________

It becomes clear, when watching the documentary, that Dodi's father deeply loved his son and was shattered by his death. Why would he spend millions to produce and promote a documentary on the suspicious circumstances surrounding his death and shortly later take it off the market without giving much reason? The only explanation that makes sense is that he has been put under enormous pressure to do so. Not only has he been bullied to take his film off the market, but the blackmailers made it his problem to prevent others from republishing it.

...

The documentary the Windsors don't want you to watch

So let's go back to the ""Unlawful Killing"" documentary and see what all the fuss is about. The film starts by showing a letter from Diana, hand-written to her butler, predicting her own violent death. It says, ""My husband is planning `an accident' in my car. Brake failure & serious head injury."" Less than two years later her prediction came true.

The documentary next shows numerous people saying that her death was murder. Mohamed Al-Fayed, Dodi's father, goes even further. He goes on record in the documentary saying that it was a slaughter by the `bloody racist' royal family. He thinks the royal family got his son killed because they were too racist to accept a foreign, Muslim step-father or a Muslim half-brother or half-sister for the future king.

The film maker himself, Keith Allen, points out how ""chillingly convenient"" it was for the Windsors that the crash happened when it did. Mohamed Al-Fayed describes how Diana, in the two weeks she stayed for a holiday with her sons at his house, was worried that exactly that kind of accident would happened to her as it did shortly after. It would appear that she got warned.

The inquest

The documentary mainly focuses on the massive inquest at the Royal Court of Justice, dismissed by several speakers in the film as a cover up. They criticise that Charles, in spite of being implicated by Diana's letter as trying to kill her exactly the way she died, wasn't required to appear as a witness. It talks about how the Royal Court of Justice first sought to conduct the inquest without a jury, an attempt that got only overturned because of public pressure. It questions the impartiality of an inquest conducted at the Royal Court of Justice led by a ""coroner"" who has sworn his allegiance to the Queen, in a case where members of the royal family are the prime suspects. Not very surprising then for the film maker that the coroner appeared at times to have already made up his mind about the outcome of the inquest, before it had even started.

The whole point of the inquest was to examine the suspicious circumstances surrounding the car crash. Was it a pure coincidence that Diana had told many people that she had been warned by a confidential source in the palace, that Prince Philip had plans to deliberately kill her in a car crash, exactly the way she died? Why didn't the CCTV cameras along the route of the crash car apparently record anything, a `coincidence' the crash shares with the 7/7 London Tube attacks? Were the driver's blood samples tampered with to make him appear wildly drunk while seeming to be sober? Why were Diana's phone calls being bugged by the American NSA? Why were Diana's seat belts jammed on the night of the accident, preventing her from - as she normally would - wearing a seat belt, which probably would have saved her life? Why didn't the police identify the owners or driver of any of the five other vehicles involved in the crash? And why did it take ambulances 2 hours to transport Diana to the nearest hospital?

According to the film, the suspicious circumstances didn't stop there. Even before the end of the medical examination of his body, the French press already published headlines according to which the driver was ""as drunk as a pig"". That's in spite of the fact that according to his hotel bill he had only had 2 Ricards, less than a quarter the amount of what French authorities claimed that he had drunk. Road sweepers were allowed by the Police to clean the site of the car crash, within hours of the accident. The film points out the similarity to the case of the Pakistani politician Benazir Bhutto, where the site of his murder was hosed down by police almost immediately after the attack, obviously because it is easier to claim it was just an accident if the evidence is washed away.

At the end of the inquest, the jury had heard so much suspicious information that the coroner heading the inquest could not take any risk. In his three day instructions to the jury, he told the jury to ignore the eye-witness statements and forbid the jury to even consider the possibility of murder. The jury, however, ignored the coroners instructions and spent a whole week to carefully examine the evidence for themselves.

The media

The film also examines the negative attitude of the media towards the inquest, obviously considering it to be a waste of time. It was quite common for the journalists observing the inquest to fall asleep or manicure their fingernails instead of paying attention to the witnesses. They were only interested in information confirming the ""established consensus"", established before the start of the inquest, that drunk driving and harassment by paparazzi had caused the crash, and ignored all the witness statements contradicting it. Any different view was regarded as ""odd"" and ""conspiracy theory"". Part of the problem, according to the film, was the fact that it was the royal correspondents, not legal journalists who were covering the inquest, in spite of the fact that Diana no longer had royal status at the time of her death. You cannot expect impartiality of journalists like the BBC's royal correspondent, whose job it is solely to ""suck up to the royal family"" and portray it in the most favourable light possible. But even if they had wanted to, they wouldn't have understood the detailed evidence or how the establishment was manipulating behind the scenes which and how much evidence they were allowed to see. That's why they didn't question, for example, why the Royal Court censored into incomprehensibility letters of Prince Philip written to Diana. The Royal Court went even as far as forbidding close friends of Diana to tell the inquest about deeply hostile letters of Princess Philip written to Diana not long before her death.

The accident itself

The movie then describes the accident itself based on the reports of several witness statements in the inquest. Diana's powerful Mercedes Benz quickly left the following paparazzi behind. When they entered the tunnel, they were surrounded by 4 motorcycles and a white Fiat Uno. Suddenly a very bright flashlight blinded Diana's driver, making him lose control and crash head first into a concrete pillar. None of the other vehicles got ever identified. It's been verified by the French police that none of the vehicles was driven by any of the paparazzi waiting in front of the hotel that night. They have all been accounted for. That didn't stop the British media though from misrepresenting the inquest's verdict - in a massive world-wide misinformation campaign led by the BBC - as saying that it was the following paparazzi who caused the crash. What the inquest actually established was that the vehicles surrounding Diana's car in the tunnel caused the accident.

The ambulance

The most bizarre circumstance of the accident was probably the behaviour of the ambulance. Several ambulances arrived soon at the scene of the accident. Given the time of the day, after midnight, the streets were virtually empty. And yet, it took the ambulance carrying Diana 81 minutes to drive her to the near-by hospital, without making radio contact with the headquarter. That's on top of the 37 minutes it took the oddly behaving doctor in sole charge of treating Diana, Jean-Marc Martino, to move the still conscious from the undamaged back of her car into the ambulance. If she had received prompt hospital treatment, the expert witnesses at the inquest all agreed, Diana would have survived.

The role of the MI6

The film coughs at the claim by the head of MI6 towards the inquest that his agency has never killed anyone in the past 50 years. It shows former MI6 agent Richard Tomlinson, an inquest witness, who has written a book titled ""The Big Breach"" describing how MI6 had planned to murder the Serbian leader exactly the same way how Diana, Dodi and her driver were killed: making his car crash in a narrow tunnel by flashing a very bright light into the driver's eyes. The MI6 boss was obviously lying, a view supported in the film by another former senior MI6 agent, Baroness Daphne Park, who clearly states that she's been involved in murders on behalf of the MI6.

Diana's campaign to ban anti-personnel landmines

According to the film, MI6 and other secret services had more reason to want Diana dead than just her plan to get married to a Muslim: her highly effective support for the world-wide campaign to ban anti-personnel landmines. Her involvement caused huge anger amongst Western governments and the armament industry. It even caused the British defence minister Nicholas Soames to call Diana on the phone and tell her, ""Don't meddle in things you don't know anything about. Accidents can happen.""

Diana's murder happened just three weeks before the Oslo conference to ban anti-personnel mines. Without Diana as the most prominent ambassador of the conference, most of the world's media no longer bothered to attend. Bill Clinton was the only government leader attending the conference who voted against a world-wide ban on landmines. If Diana had been still alive, he would have to do so while looking into Diana's eyes. According to the film, many observers believe that's the real reason why she got killed, but the coroner of the inquest wasn't interested in that line of thought.

Dodgy autopsy results

The autopsy of the driver, which stated that he was highly drunk, in spite of having had only two Ricards that night and appearing completely sober on the hotel CCTV captured when leaving the hotel, was performed by Professor Dominique Lecomte, a doctor notorious for her involvement in French government cover-ups. Her autopsy was ripped apart by other medical experts as completely incompetent and having made several critical mistakes, as was Dr. Lepin's result of the blood sample taken of the driver, which was found to have been highly likely tampered with. Professor Lecomte and Dr. Lepin both refused to attend the inquest, after being ordered by the French government to do so to protect the French state's secrets and interests. When specialist later wanted to examine whether the DNA of the blood samples was identical with that of the driver, they were told by the French government that those samples no longer exist.

Police corruption

Diana had not only spoken to numerous friends about her ex-husband's family planning to kill her in a car accident and mentioned it in a letter to her butler. She had also written a letter to her lawyer about it who passed it on to the police. In spite of her being later killed exactly in the way described in her letter, the chief of police kept the letter concealed for three years, knowingly breaking the law by concealing this devastating evidence. He was rewarded handsomely by the Queen by being made a `Lord'.

Not only did the autopsy report make false accusations about the driver's alcohol level, it even suggested that he was a severe case of alcoholic. The English police tried to support this false claim by searching the driver's apartment twice for alcohol. The first time they went there, they could only find a bottle of champagne and a  empty bottle of Martini. Unsatisfied with the result they went in again, and this time they found enough alcohol to stock an entire bar.

Diana's embalmment

In spite of no longer being `Royal' at the time of her death, Diana was embalmed within hours of her death, according to the film, to make it impossible to perform a pregnancy test. Not only were her organs removed and destroyed, but so was the blood sample taken from her at her arrival at the Paris hospital. The film suggests that this was to avoid any suggestion that Muslim blood had entered the royal blood lines.

The Queen's private secretary

Sir Robert Fellowes was the highest ranked representative of the Windsors appearing at the inquest. Under oath, he claimed to have been on holidays for the entire period before and after the accident. Yet, the diary of Tony Blairs' press secretary Alastair Campbell clearly states that she met Mr Fellowes on several occasions through the period he claimed to have been on holidays. Diana had mentioned to friends before that he was one of the three people she was most afraid of. She believed that Mr Fellowes hated her with a passion and wanted her out of the Royal family. The film suggests that Mr Fellowes had a leading role in the arrangements for her death.

The Fiat Uno

The prime suspect to have caused the crash is the driver of the Fiat Uno which was seen by numerous witnesses. Neither the English nor the French police was apparently able to identify him, and yet one of the best known paparazzi, James Andanson, with connections to secret services, drove exactly that kind of car. Andandon who made a fortune selling pictures of British royalties and other celebrities to the media, lived in France and was known to have followed Diana and Dodi in their last holiday before the accident. He was not part of the paparazzi crowd waiting in front of the Ritz hotel owned by Dodi's father. When interviewed by French police about his whereabouts, he made contradictory statements, as did his wife and son who served as his alibis. In spite of these circumstances, the investigation against him was dropped and the search for the Fiat Uno ended without result. The inquest made no further attempt to establish who was driving the implicated car.

In 2000, Andason was found dead in his blazing car on a Ministry of Defense owned field outside Montpellier. He had no car keys with him and the two firemen who found him had seen two bullet holes in his skull. The French police however decided that he had committed suicide. The film maker comments that you don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to find it hard to believe that a man shot himself in the head twice and then set his car on fire.

Royal family

The last third of the film goes in full attack on the Windsors. It criticises the huge cost to British tax payers, their racism towards non-Whites and their initial strong support for Hitler. It accuses the Queen mother, her husband, as well as Prince Philip and his sisters to have been highly supportive of Nazi Germany, at least initially. It goes on to ask why the British people still tolerates the monarchy. It accuses British officials of corruption because they were more loyal to the monarch than to the people and care more about earning a knighthood than obeying the law. The film goes even as far as calling the British royal family mafia-style gangsters.

Later in the film Prince Philip is quoted as saying that if reincarnation existed he would like to be reborn as a deadly virus, so he could do something about over-population. This quote must be seen in the context of Prince Philip being the highest ranked Scottish Rite Freemason, a secret society known to aim for a `big cull' reducing mankind to a `sustainable level' of 500 million, that is a reduction of 93%.

The most controversial part of the documentary is an interview with leading British clinical psychologist Oliver James, describing Prince Philip as someone without any internal sense of right or wrong. According to James, Prince Philip is completely selfish and does not care about anybody else. In his expert opinion, Prince Philip is on par with notorious psychopathic mass-murderers.

Summary

The main film very convincingly argues that - in the light of the long list of suspicious circumstances and cover-ups - it would be too much of a coincidence that Diana got killed exactly at a time when Western secret services and armament manufacturers were infuriated about her anti-personnel landmine campaign and the Windsors about the prospect of a Muslim step-father and Muslim siblings to the future British King.
