2532708,4,B000ERVJOA,"If you are new to exercising at home and are looking to make a single purchase to meet virtually all of your exercise needs, this DVD set by veteran instructor Kathy Smith just might fit the bill.  You get three complete workouts:  an interval-style cardio workout, a weighted upper body work, and a lower body workout.  Brief descriptions of each are listed below.

Functionally Fit Peak Fat Burning.  A well-done, 42-minute aerobic workout for advanced beginner to intermediate exercisers. It uses an interval training strategy, which involves alternating high intensity cardio bursts with slower recovery periods.  It offers lower-impact options and plus toning work for the lower body.

Secrets of a Great Upper Body.  A solid workout targeting all of the major muscle groups in the entire upper body. Includes detailed instructional portions between each exercise as well as helpful form cues.  The entire workout is about 32 minutes long, which includes a 6-minute abs/back portion.

Secrets of a Great Lower Body.  This 40-minute workout targets all of the muscles of the lower body using the low-rep overload principle.  A chair is used for some of the moves, and ankle weights are optional.  As with the upper body workout, there are detailed instructional portions between each exercise as well as helpful form cues.

In all three of the above workouts, the moves are pretty basic, so more experienced exercisers might find them to be boring.  However, Kathy is an enthusiastic instructor who is perfect for motivating beginners, and thus I would definitely recommend this DVD set to anyone who is just starting out.",1184112000,27,1626,5.129277566539924
2532709,4,B000ERVJOA,"I think this is the best workout I have used and I have tried plenty.

I would recommend it for intermediate users.",1173312000,5,115,4.2272727272727275
2532710,5,B000ERVJOA,"I'm an intermediate/advanced exerciser, and this set of workouts from Kathy Smith is one of my favorites.  As everyone always says, Kathy is a great instructor.  She's upbeat and encouraging but never insincere or annoying, and her cues and explanations are helpful and to the point.  I'm no expert on weight training, but from my point of view the upper and lower body workouts are incredibly thorough -- I worked muscles I'd never thought about working -- and the format (an explanation and demonstration precede each new move) makes it easier to get the correct form.  The 40-minute cardio workout alternates 6 higher intensity intervals with segments of ""active recovery"" and lower body moves, but my heart rate stays elevated the entire time, and I finish feeling like I've had a good day's worth of exercise, especially if I use the ""advanced modifiers"" Kathy presents.  The moves are very simple and easy to pick up, but never too boring.  Overall, if you can get past the eighties fashion and production values, this is a very effective set of workouts, and a great deal.",1171065600,14,1079,4.868852459016393
2532711,5,B000ERVJOA,"I really enjoy this dvd I have most of Kathy Smith's excercise tapes. this one  they demonstrate the proper technique on each excercise, And you can ""break"" up the segments too. You Don't have to do the whole dvd in one  day if you don't feel like it. Each segment works different Muscle groups and she explains along the way. You can't miss with Kathys excercise videos/DVD's!",1162684800,4,377,4.611940298507463
2532712,2,B000ERVJOA,"This is not my favorite of Kathy Smith's DVDs.  I do generally enjoy her workouts, but with this this DVD I don't care for the extra long introductions (which you cannot skip over), and also the fact that she does cheesy voice overs for the workouts as opposed to talking throughout the routine.  Additionally, the music she chose is horrible, elevator music and not at all motivating.  I've done the workouts a few times but mostly this one is sitting on the shelf.",1159920000,10,466,4.590361445783133
2532713,5,B000ERVJOA,"Finally, ""Secrets of a Great Body-Upper Body"" and ""Secrets of a Great Body-Lower Body"" have come to DVD!  It's an added bonus that ""Functionally Fit- Peak Fat Burning"" is thrown into the mix on this DVD, too.

If you're just starting out, this single DVD with these three workouts is really just what you need, because you can do ""Upper Body"" one day, ""Functionally Fit"" the next, and ""Lower Body"" the day after.  Then take a rest day, and repeat the sequence.  There you have a whole week of workouts that fit easily into your schedule, and you're giving your muscle groups adequate rest so that you keep seeing results.

If you've been exercising for a while, you can still benefit from this DVD.  The workout really does grow with you.  Just get heavier weights.  I started using this workout when I was in college.  I used 3, 5, and 8-pound dumbbells and really worked my muscles.  Then it started feeling ""easy,"" and besides, I'd gotten a DVD player and so my VHS workouts stayed on the shelf while I rocked out with other workout systems.  It's been 4 years since I did this workout, but the minute the DVD came, I put it in and used my current weight range (8 to 15 pounds for upper body and 10 to 25 pounds for lower body) and this workout still packs a wallop.  You need to shake up your routine once in a while to keep seeing results, and going back to the low-rep overload method Kathy Smith employs in ""Upper Body"" and ""Lower Body"" is a great way to do just that.  Also, there are some exercises, such as Calf Raises and especially Center Trap Shrugs, that are fairly rare on exercise videos, but are so important to do, nonetheless.

This DVD is such a great value, with three great workouts for the low price.  The workouts will grow with you, and for extra challenge, you could always do the seated work on a ball instead of on a chair, so you can add a little twist on the workouts yourself.  It's important for beginners to pay attention to the explanations of each muscle group, so you know just what you're working and why, and more advanced exercisers could use that time to give their muscles a good stretch, get a few more reps in, or choose their weights for the next exercise.  Even if you're devoted to another workout system, this is a great DVD to add to your mix to keep your muscles confused so you keep seeing results!",1157241600,64,2348,4.398148148148148
2532714,4,B000ERVJOA,"Great upper and lower body workout with an aerobic section also. My only comment is that the upper and lower body workouts do have detailed explanations of each move, so it's not as flowing if you like to keep moving all the way thru the exercises.",1154390400,14,248,4.413043478260869
2532715,5,B000ERVJOA,I was looking for a home work out so I could reclaim a shapely figure without expensive equipment or endless reps. This is it. The lower body work out requires a step and a chair. For the uppper body work out you will need a few small dumbbells and a pillow. Not expensive equipment at all. The exercises are very effective and Kathy gives clear directions and alternate moves for beginners. (like me),1148083200,39,401,4.506849315068493
2532716,5,B000ERVJOA,"This is a complete program on one DVD and it is Kathy Smith--what more could you ask for.  It gets the Upper Body, Lower Body and Cardio in one complete pkg.  These might be ""classics"", but they are still great workouts.  Can't wait for the others to come out Kathy!!",1147996800,12,267,4.3
2532717,5,B000ERVJOA,"I was hoping for this to happen one day and now is here!  This is a great value CD with Kathy's best weight and cardio complete programs consoildated on one CD!  Great job and thanks, Kathy!",1147910400,16,190,4.25
2532768,5,B000ERVJOA,"great video, especially for someone (such as myself) who hasn't had an exercise routine for a while.  easy-to-follow steps, but really gets your heart pumping!!",1265500800,2,160,5.4
2532769,2,B000ERVJOA,"I am a huge Kathy Smith fan, but I did not like this nearly as much as her other workouts. I found the lower body workout to be a bit boring--the music was way to mellow. I didn't like the introductions before each segment and I found the pace to be too slow. Also, Kathy seemed to be missing her usual energy. For toning, I would instead recommend her Lift Weights to Lose Weight, Volume 1.

However, I did enjoy the cardio segment, which is why I gave the dvd two stars. It's a nice workout if you don't have a lot of time. It gets you moving and is a good pace.",1247011200,7,564,3.9911504424778763
2532770,5,B000ERVJOA,"She always manages to get you to work up a sweat in a very small space!

Anytime you get Kathy Smith for a workout, any kind, you can't go wrong.",1244764800,,145,3.8333333333333335
2532771,3,B000ERVJOA,"This a great work out, the body sculpting is particularly good. I gave it 3 stars because Kathy sounds like she is reading cue cards, so that really put me off.",1237334400,2,160,4.193548387096774
2532772,5,B000ERVJOA,This is a balanced well rounded workout. I use this more for the strenght training selections - but will do the arobics every once in a while. You get your moneys worth with the work outs.,1234742400,2,188,4.25
2532773,5,B000ERVJOA,"This is a great value for a fitness DVD. It contains Kathy's Functionally Fit Fat Burning Workout, Secrets to a Great Upper Body Workout and Secrets to a Great Lower Body Workout. I like all three workouts. The cardio is about 30 minutes (including warm-up) and consists of higher impact intervals with lower impact recovery, including some lower body toning and a little balance work. Basic choreography and a great aerobic workout. The upper and lower body toning segments are really good workouts too, both about 40 min. They use body weight for some moves and weights for others, I can increase the weights as I gain strength. Surprising calf and shin work, I really felt those the next day. Kathy's a little quick between segments and you may need to back-up to catch the first moves, but that's minor. These are a little older workouts, maybe from the 90's(?), but very elegantly filmed and not dated. Overall, great workouts for the price.",1231632000,9,946,4.809815950920245
2532774,4,B000ERVJOA,"I borrowed this workout from the local library before I decided to buy it.  What I like about it is you get effective sculpting of the upper and lower body.  The upper and lower body sculpting segments are each about 40 minutes long.  It's different from a workout that concentrates on weight training.  Each move is displayed by one of Kathy's exercise group members to ensure you do the moves properly before you begin the exercise.

There is a cardio segment where you can follow at a slower pace or the ramped-up pace by emulating the exercise group member you choose.  When it becomes a little more intense, a 2-minute timer appears on the screen so you know you will be working at that capacity for a short time.  This is also about 40 minutes long.

This is like getting 3 separate workouts in one DVD!",1223337600,,809,4.493150684931507
2532775,4,B000ERVJOA,"Worth adding to your collection, especially at this Amazon price!  Kathy has always been one of my favorites.  She does a great job explaining her moves, and keeps a smile on her face!",1194480000,,184,4.545454545454546
2532776,5,B000ERVJOA,"A friend who's been raving about Kathy Smith for years has kindly let me borrow some of her Smith DVDs and I'm hooked for life!

The Peak Fat Burning Workout delivers. I've done it three times over the past 9 days and have lost four pounds. I usually go for a walk on alternate, low-intensity days, but today I tried Kathy's Latin Rhythm Workout&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kathy-Smith-Latin-Rhythm-Workout/dp/B000ILYYVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kathy Smith - Latin Rhythm Workout</a>&nbsp;instead and loved that too.

I've always used a treadmill or bike for high-intensity cardio, but Peak Fat Burning is more effective and more fun. I'd always thought interval training was just another gimmick, but it works!

I also like the fact that I get a good workout but I also get those rest periods for lower body work. It isn't really a rest because you're working those muscle groups hard, but it does give you a chance to catch your breath. After I finish Peak Fat Burning, I feel energized. Other aerobics DVDs I've tried wore me out so much, I nearly fell asleep at my desk. Interval training really does burn fat and it won't leave you feeling like a rag doll.

I hate doing strength training and always quit too soon. Kathy is so encouraging, I've managed to do the lower body and upper body workouts the whole way through. I've only done each of these workouts once the past week, but that's a big improvement for me!

My goal is to learn about more good home exercise DVDs and setup a rotation. The Super Slimdown Circuit is my cornerstone for my eventual home exercise library.",1193788800,2,1632,5.029629629629629
2532777,4,B000ERVJOA,"The toning really burns.  I don't like the circuit, because the toning in between the aerobic doesn't feel like it's doing anything.  The cardio bursts are tough, though.",1186272000,3,170,5.035714285714286
8113757,5,B000ERVJOA,"It's an oldie, but surely a goodie. So glad I was able to find this video still for sale! There is no other workout that works quite as well as this winning combination when you need to tone up. Thanks Kathy!!",1448409600,,209,4.121951219512195
8113758,2,B000ERVJOA,"Granite all of the traditional aerobics workouts are from the nineties and early 2000 but even so this was clearly compliation Kathy Smith workout that were introducing weight lifting to women like maybe in the eighties based on the breast. Granite all of the traditional rover to work out there from the ninety's and early 2000 but Even so this was clearly Compile a shin Of kathy smith work out that work introducing Weightlifting to women like maybe in the eighty's face on the draft. It's super slow any upper body only focus is on 3 areas: deltoid, pecs, triceps. She states you need to lift heavy weight and do low reps but she does a lot of workout without weights and higher reps. This is what I would classify as a good attempt in the early days of weight lifting butt we are beyond this free type of workout. Not Kathy's usual dead ringer.",1438214400,,849,4.483870967741935
8113759,4,B000ERVJOA,"All in all a good DVD. I really bought this for the Functional Fitness portion, as my original Functional Fitness DVD finally burned out. The other two
workouts are good, altho a couple times getting into position fast enough was a problem for me, but probably not so much for a younger person.",1425945600,3,294,4.566037735849057

8113761,5,B000ERVJOA,"This is a great workout. Especially the lower body section. I have bought this dvd as a present for friends. Very do-able, about a 25 to 30 min workout for upper and lower body each, and a separate section for abs. Kathy is a great instructor and great on camera. She doesn't talk too much and gives you just enough info on what you're doing. I highly recommend this dvd.",1311984000,,371,4.314285714285714
8113762,4,B000ERVJOA,"This is a good workout.  I work out regularly and yet found my muscles ached a little the day after this workout.  Because of the different mixes on the DVD, I can do a workout Monday and get a different workout on Tuesday; so it's like getting 2 DVD's in one...a good value for the cost.

The one complaint I have is the editing is off in a couple spots. Although Kathy does show proper form for each new exercise there's a couple times when there is no time allowed for getting into position or for transitioning to the new exercise; she goes right into it and you lose the first few reps.  I have noticed this with other DVD's by other instructors as well.  I recommend the DVD.",1300752000,3,681,4.248062015503876
8113763,5,B000ERVJOA,aerobic or upper body or lower body.  Harder than what we were doing.  Lots of reps.  We like the aerobic part as it does 2 min at speed and then 2 min slower all the way through.  Great conditioning. Kathy Smith: Super Slimdown Circuit,1291852800,,236,4.295454545454546
8113764,5,B000ERVJOA,"I get the most use out of the Functional Fitness interval routine on this dvd but it's great to have the 2 'Secrets' workouts, too.  I had the upper body workout on vhs back in the day - love it! but the instructions get old after the first 5 or so times you do it.",1281398400,,265,3.8181818181818183
8113765,5,B000ERVJOA,"This 3 in 1 is awesome!! The upper body workout is perfect for anyone biginner or advanced and a nice break from the peak fat burning workout that really gets the heart going. Again VERY easy to follow workouts that really get results!! And if you are worried about the amount of room in your home to workout...don't be, you don't need a ton of space to do these workouts.",1272067200,5,372,4.328571428571428
8113766,5,B000ERVJOA,"This is a great workout DVD.  I found the upperbody workout not as challenging as I'm used to, but I've also been weight lifting for 17 years.  But it had some great new moves I don't normally do and have now incorporated them into my routine.

  The lower body workout was a challenge, but I will admit I don't do enough down there.  Lets just say my butt hurt, and you'll be mad at Kathy Smith for a few days afterwards.  I could feel it working after only a few weeks, my jogging, everything was stronger, and it helps me with my job because I do a lot of standing.

  Finally, the cardio workout was good, she brings in some strength training inbetween cool downs, but I feel like I could do a little more..........So I do!",1266278400,,727,4.240875912408759
