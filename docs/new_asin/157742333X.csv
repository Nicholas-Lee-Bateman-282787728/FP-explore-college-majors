Compassion and love was the message i got from clown white, also there is a certain magic as actors are canadian and as icing on the cake bruce cockburn has incredible music to the soundtrack. Can't recommend enough this movie I bet over half the people reading this review will not be sorry to view it.the million dollar question is whatever became of  Mark Christopher Dillon who played Jason? enjoy!",1411516800,,1039,4.51595744680851
8501541,5,157742333X,"I was up late writing a term paper last semester in the computer room in the library, and I was all bummed because my frat brothers were partying with the Pi Phis.  So I went into this chatroom, after I finished writing my introduction, and some dude from Australia recommended some movie called ""The Clown at Midnight"", but I forgot by the time I got to Blockbusters and rented ""Clown White"" instead.
Apparently, ""clown white"" is a color that make-up artists use to describe the color of makeup that clowns put on their face (if it is a white clown).  And the movie is so awesome!!!  Its about a little boy who is all sad cause he's deaf, and he meets this white clown who cant talk or anything, but the clown is funny and nice to the boy, and the boy ends up all happy even though he cant hear.
At first I was watching it by myself, but then R-Dawg (he's the chef at our frat house) came in and watched it with me.  Next thing you know, half of my brothers are in there watching it.  This has to be one of the most classic movies about clowns!!!
And now its a tradition at our frat house.  After every party we throw starts to wind down, everybody crowds into the lounge and we put in ""Clown White"".  The chicks really dig it, and I feel good that I turned my whole frat onto ""art films"", especially ones with clowns.",1037923200,4,1319,4.2103174603174605
8501542,1,157742333X,"Call me a traditionalist, but I just didn't ""get"" this movie. It's about Adolphus, a high-fashion, heavily made-up, futuristic robot alien who visits Earth in a mission to reenact Snow White with a troupe of mimes he meets in a deli. For realism, Adlophus uses his shrink ray (which actually looks like a hairy dill pickle) to shrink 7 of the mimes to be the 7 dwarves. Personally, I found the use of real little people -- shirtless and smeared in clown makeup -- extremely tasteless. Of course, Adolphus plays Snow White and is extremely wooden and not believable at all. He definitely needed acting lessons and a shower. At times, the movie was overly artsy: the apple biting scene took 35 minutes (it was just Adolphus biting an apple over and over again!) and the ""Mirror on the Wall"" was just stock footage of an obese man eating a cheeseburger in a restaurant.

I was very angry because I thought this was a children's movie and I showed it at my son Van's 7th birthday party and the kids all cried and didn't want cake after the movie. I'm just thankful they were too young to pick up on how offensive this movie was to women.
Parents: this is NOT a movie for children. This is a movie for mimes and maybe small clowns. Don't make the same mistake I did.",1037923200,2,1261,4.435344827586207
