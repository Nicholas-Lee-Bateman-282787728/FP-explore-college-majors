By the end of the documentary, I felt I had taken the same journey of discovery that Rachel took.  I felt I knew the homeless people as well as I know my friends.  Watching ""Without A HOme"" is a very special experience, an experience I recommend to everyone.",1316995200,6,400,4.378378378378378
4849110,5,B005NL7WL6,"This is such a brave and heartful film that will change your life in a profound way.
Fleischer captures the many faces of homelessness and returns us to the basic spirit of humanity which has the capacity to heal even the most seeimingly hopeless of individuals. Without  A Home bears witness to the fact that basic human kindness can transform someone's life...including your own.",1316649600,6,381,4.953125
4849111,5,B005NL7WL6,"Rachel Fleischer has put together a harrowing film on the homeless in Los Angeles. In actually getting to know the people on the streets rather than just showing facts and figures, one gets to really understand the impact, sadness, and sometimes the horrors of living on the street. Even beyond that, it is Rachel's journey as she slowly comprehends what it really means to be homeless. Rachel is one of us - someone who is saddened by this condition but maybe never fully thought it through. She takes the courageous step of entering this world and taking us with her.

Although some scenes can be dramatic and heavy, it is a very watch-able film and very entertaining due to Rachel's screen presence. It biggest strength is that this is not a movie that throws this cause in your face or tries to guilt trip you into volunteering at a shelter. She merely opens the world for you to see and then you can form your own conclusion.

Highly recommend.",1316649600,18,949,4.609467455621302
4849112,4,B005NL7WL6,"Filmmaker Rachel Fleischer with her ""Without a Home"" provides an intimate look into the lives of several homeless people and inspires the viewer to appreciate their own lives and think twice about pre-judging the homeless. I ran into one of her subjects at the bus stop near my house, recognized him from the film and stopped to have conversation with him. I would not have done so had I not seen the film. Even if you don't want to give donations to a homeless person, a hi or a smile just may inspire hope in them.",1316649600,3,516,4.385416666666667

8480648,5,B005NL7WL6,"""Without A Home"" is a rare gem of a documentary.  At once personal, topical, sincere, pressing, and heartfelt.  Rachel oozes empathy for a topic, for a people, that are often disregarded and left out in the cold - both literally and figuratively.

8480650,5,B005NL7WL6,"Rachel Fleischer has created a gem of a documentary with her study of homelessness in Los Angeles.  The point of view is extremely personal, since through the actual act of conducting the interviews and shooting the film,  the traditional lines between documentarian and subject are often seen in a state of flux.
