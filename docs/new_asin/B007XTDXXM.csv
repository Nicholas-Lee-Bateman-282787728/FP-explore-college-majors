No fancy makeup (though his makeup jobs are, of course, superb). No far-flung setting. It's a man playing two very different characters on screen: his character and the character's fictional brother, which he uses as a cover for his illegal activity. (It's the premise...not a spoiler, I promise.) The audience is in on the ruse and it's a good one.

The musical score was fitting and well-recorded. Many thanks to the Warner Archive for making such films available. With the shrinking number of theaters that will play such films, it's a great thing for me, as a 30 year old, to be able to see these films at all.",1353715200,7,1291,6.505813953488372
5114310,4,B007XTDXXM,"Not as well known as Chaney's most popular films, Phantom & Hunchback, this still is a great film and showcases Chaney's talents even if he's not covered by make-up. This film would make a great back to back double feature with The Penalty I think. This is on the Warner Archive Made on Demand DVD service, Ive ordered most of the Chaney films and this will be no exception. The market just isn't big enough anymore to create wide releases for these types of films Im not even sure if this has ever recieved a release on home video before so grab it now and add it to your silent/Chaney library. West of Zanzibar recently released as well, thats worth getting too!",1337904000,10,664,4.450819672131147
8523008,5,B007XTDXXM,"It is a modern day miracle that we are able to see this movie at all, albeit only on DVD, since so may of Chaney's movies are considered lost.  I am 61 years old and have been a Chaney Sr. fan since seeing the Hunchback of Notre Dame at the Bizou theatre in Kansas City around 1978.  The great things about The Blackbird are numerous.  Released in 1926 in the early years of MGM and Chaney rising to his peak after the Phantom of the Opera, it displays one of his most memorable performances.  Reminiscent of the 1919 film ""The Miracle Man"",  Chaney uses his amazing and rare talents as a contortionist to portray a pain-ridden cripple as only Chaney can pull off with such credibility.  Renee Adoree gives a beautiful and heart-felt performance as well.  Renee Adore films are rare, since her life was ended early by tuberculosis in 1933.  Owen Moore, notable for being Mary Pickford's first husband, plays the third character in the menage a trois.  The weird storyline is typical of director Tod Browning and is somewhat similar to a later Chaney/Browning film ""The Unknown "".  The DVD appears to be a presentation by TCM and includes a very nice orchestral score by Robert Israel.

Not much bad I can say about this film.  There are a couple off-color subtitles that could be considered racist and do not contribute to the story line, but that is indicative of the time period of Hollywood in the 1920s.  There is some evidence of nitrate deterioration in a few frames, but overall the print is clean, sharp and has nice contrast.  Amazing for a film that is 93 years old.  I highly recommend this film for silent and classic film enthusiasts as well as novices.",1526083200,,1666,4.581081081081081
8523009,5,B007XTDXXM,"This is an enjoyable 1925 black and white silent film for 76 minutes starring the man with a thousand faces, Lon Chaney. I wrote in my earlier review, my first review of a Lon Chaney film, that I thought he overacts. I change my mind. Yes, he acts in a more dramatic fashion than all other actors in the film, with many contortions of his face, but this adds to the entertainment. I learnt to like his overacting.
In this film, which is easy to follow despite being silent, Chaney plays a criminal who sometimes acts as The Blackbird, a tough in the worst part of London who robs people. At other times he acts as The Bishop, a very kind man who helps people and whom people love. He takes The Bishop role to hide when the police are after him.
The main plot is that he falls in love with a woman who falls for another man. He does all he can to break up that relationship.
A subplot is that his former wife is still in love with him and wants to help him.",1501804800,,956,4.117647058823529
8523010,4,B007XTDXXM,"Preposterous but enjoyable silent melodrama, with Lon Chaney great (as usual) as a man with two identities.  He appears alternately as The
Black Bird -- a tough, heartless, low-life and thief, or his brother The Bishop -- a gentle, kindly soul, with a deformed body who runs a home for the poor and otherwise homeless (A character invented by the black bird to help cover his tracks, not out of any real goodness of heart).

While it seems silly to think no one ever puts together that the two brothers, who are never seen together, are really the same man, Chaney does such a terrific job, and the film has such a nice, dark sense of humor that its possible to squint and look past that stretch.  (BTW  this is no spoiler, the audience is in on the trick in the 1st few minutes).  Tod Browning does his usual solid job, creating some nice atmosphere and visuals, and the acting is generally pretty restrained for a silent film.  This a movie where you can really appreciate how sophisticated silent actors and directors had gotten with telling stories with body language and facial expressions.  At times there is dialogue with no title cards, but you can always get just what is being said from the acting and the context.

The story involves the normally heartless Black Bird getting pulled into a love triangle, and the tragic consequences for all.  Not a great film, or a  necessary part of film history, but I was happy to have seen it, and to have it in my collection to re-visit.

The Warner Archive transfer is not bad at all for a film this age, although I found the score a little over-the-top and literal at times (a character merely mentions going to a night club in passing, and suddenly theres 20 seconds of jaunty and distracting night club music  a lot of that kind of thing).",1461628800,,1793,4.53416149068323
8523011,3,B007XTDXXM,"The Blackbird (1926) was the fourth (out of 10) teaming two of the biggest stars of the silent era  director Tod Browning and actor Lon Chaney.

Tod Browning (1880-1962) was one of the most unusual of all Hollywood directors, and thats saying a lot when you consider the list of characters includes Wild Bill Wellman, John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Alfred Hitchcock, etc. Brownings peak was in the silent era, when he produced such classics as The Unholy Three (1925), London After Midnight (1927), and The Unknown (1927), but he is best known for the classic Dracula (1931) and for Freaks (1932). Browning was the first and truest of the American directors to adopt the German expressionist techniques and themes, and he embraced them to such an extent that he outdid the originals.

His films, especially the ones with Chaney, can be hard to watch, since they involve mutilated and deformed people, with themes involving revenge, sexual exploitation, murder, and mayhem. He often set his films in carnival shows (where he had once worked) and often employed carnival acts as part of the plot.

Lon Chaney (1883-1930) was one of the biggest stars of the silent era. Known as The man of 1000 faces, he was capable of disguising himself completely in service of his roles, which could be as diverse as a hunchback (Hunchback of Notre Dame), a legless man (The Penalty), an armless man who throws knives with his feet (The Unknown) or a monster (Phantom of the Opera). He enjoyed crime stories and stories that involved circus performers, and he was famous for the 10 films he made with Tod Browning. His life was the subject of the 1957 film Man of 100 Faces starring James Cagney.

By 1926 when he made this film he had already made nearly 100 films, and was at his peak. Unfortunately IMO this is one of his lesser films. The crippled Bishop shows none of the spectacular physical contortions Chaney was capable of, and his double role as The Raven shows none of his tremendous versatility as an actor. None of the supporting players give notable performances, including the dashing Own Moore (1884-1939) who is best known as Mary Pickfords first husband, and silent film sexy star Renee Adoree (1898-1933).

The best part of the film is the settings which seek to reproduce Londons Limehouse section.",1450828800,,2297,4.817258883248731
8523012,4,B007XTDXXM,"Perhaps, one of the lesser known collaborations between Lon Chaney Sr. and director Tod Browning--""The BlackBird"" has all the conventional trappings of a Chaney/Browning film; or any Chaney Sr. film now that I think about it. One of those trappings being the ""love triangle"" as it seems that Chaney spends a fair amount of time pining for a woman who ends up falling in love with another man.

This film also has Lon playing a double role--no elaborate makeups to disguise himself with--just the master craftsman contorting his body to play the part of the crippled ""Bishop"", and his nefarious brother ""The Blackbird."" Apparently, the Blackbird needed a cover to help hide his criminal activities and thus the part of the Bishop comes into play.

""The Blackbird"" starts off a bit slow, as we the audience are introduced to all the principal characters, but picks up steam towards the end. Overall, I can see why this movie is not one of the more well-known Chaney/Browning collaborations--not that I'm saying it's bad, far from it. It's a good movie & if you're a fan of Chaney Sr. then you will definitely add this one to your collection. Now, if someone could only find a surviving print of ""London After Midnight.""

8523013,4,B007XTDXXM,"I am grateful for this Warner Archive release of the Turner Classic Movies version of this rare Tod Browning film. Up until now I only had it on a VHS tape which was dubbed from a PAL released in the U.K. The picture quality was OK but the transfer was a little too fast (typical of PAL transfers) and the music score was inappropriate. Now this film and several other of Lon Chaney's MGM films are seeing the light of day giving us the opportunity to really see ""The Man of a Thousand Faces"" at work. As another reviewer pointed out, there is little makeup involved but Chaney's body language is extraordinary especially as the crippled missionary proprietor, The Bishop.

The story is a typical offbeat Chaney love triangle where his Limehouse criminal Dan ""Blackbird"" Tate is in love with French puppet performer Renee' Adoree who is in love with a sophisticated jewel thief played by Mary Pickford's first husband Owen Moore in the performance of his career. The Blackbird's alter ego is the fake cripple The Bishop which gives Chaney the opportunity to distort his body (see DVD cover). Strangely enough the criminal Chaney looks just like Albert Finney while Moore's West End Bertie could easily have been the inspiration for The Penguin in the Batman comics.

As is usually the case with Tod Browning, this film is a deft combination of striking visuals coupled with a far-fetched but strangely believable plot that is anchored in the grotesque. The black box puppet show of Rene Adoree is a classic example of this. It startles when it's first seen and once seen it's hard to forget. As is also typical of Browning, the ending is rather sudden. Nevertheless THE BLACKBIRD leaves an impression thanks to a couple of powerhouse scenes. The confrontation between The Blackbird and West End Bertie in Bertie's apartment is a classic. This release is also aided memorably by TCM's commissioned background score. While it isn't a top drawer offering, it's never less than compelling.",1432252800,3,1985,4.8698224852071

8523015,3,B007XTDXXM,"London's seedy Limehouse district has been rocked by an audacious crime spree, but, really, that's almost an afterthought in this film. THE BLACKBIRD is brought about courtesy of yet another collaboration between ""The Man of a Thousand Faces"" and Tod Browning, director of creepy cinema. It's one more exploration into the grotesque, one more exercise on the theme of deformity. Chaney and Browning have done better, but this isn't bad and it's certainly interesting.

Lon Chaney tries on dual roles. He plays Dan Tate, a notorious Cockney thief what's arrived at a most unconventional alibi and a way to elude the police. As ""The Blackbird,"" Tate thumbs his nose at the law whilst staging his daring robberies. Then he skulks away and assumes the guise of his saintly brother, him whom appreciative folks have dubbed ""The Bishop."" The Bishop is a gentle missionary beloved by all and he is a cripple. This allows Chaney to apply his contortionist skills. In this film, Chaney doesn't really play up his ""Man of a Thousand Faces"" rep. The gimmick this time lies in how he distorts his body to play up the illusion of an exaggerated physical disability.

Wouldn't you know it, a woman triggers the Blackbird's downfall. He finds himself on the losing end of a romantic triangle. The Blackbird has fallen head over heels for the vivacious French stage performer, Mademoiselle Fifi Lorraine (Rene Adore). But so has his crooked rival, West End Bertie (Owen Moore). West End Bertie is posh where Dan Tate is coarse, and it's this polish that impresses Fifi more. So there's the Blackbird, seething and scheming up a spiteful revenge.

THE BLACKBIRD came out in 1926, so it's a silent flick. But this is Lon Chaney, a man who is decidedly more than the sum of his make-up kit. Chaney can emote like a mother, with his eyes and with his expressive gestures. Unlike his other films, his character here exhibits no redeeming quality. He's a straight-up villain, and despicable. Early on, you suspect that his ex-wife, Limehouse Polly (Doris Lloyd), who still has feelings for him, may yet prove to be his salvation. But this isn't one of them feel-good pictures. Probably because Chaney's character isn't at all sympathetic, but I found THE BLACKBIRD to be only moderately entertaining. It's always fun to watch Chaney ply his craft because there always seems to be a macabre hook to his performance, but I thought the underworld melodrama plot itself - when you remove Chaney's dual roles conceit - unfolds in pedestrian fashion. I did like the (literally?) twist ending. If O. Henry had been in a foul mood and decided to write a story, it may have ended this way, which is cruel and ironic. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1366416000,2,2705,4.825431034482759
8523016,4,B007XTDXXM,"The Blackbird (1926) is a typically deranged underworld melodrama from the Tod Browning/Lon Chaney canon. It has, lamentably, never been made available to the home video market, even though the restored print shown on TCM is in quite good condition and, surprisingly, is missing no footage. The Blackbird is also one of the most visually arresting of Browning's films.

Browning opens the film authoritatively with close-ups of Limehouse derelicts fading in and out of the foggy London setting. Lon Chaney plays dual roles, of a sort. He is the debilitated cripple Bishop who runs a charitable mission in the squalid Limehouse district. Bishop's twin brother is Dan Tate, better known as the vile thief The Blackbird. Actually, in this highly improbable (and typical, for Browning) scenario, Bishop and the Blackbird are one and the same. The Blackbird feigns the role of his own twin brother as a front, which means contorting his body as he acts as if he's in excruciating pain (shades of Chaney, behind the scenes).

The Limehouse district unanimously loves the Bishop and dreads the Blackbird, save for the Blackbird's ex-wife, Limehouse Polly (Doris Lloyd, the only one of the principals players who did not die young). Polly inexplicably still loves and believes in Dan. In a vignette, Browning does not hesitate to show the ugliness of the Blackbird's racist side (an extreme rarity for the time), but the Blackbird has a slither of a soft spot himself for French patroness and music hall marionette performer Fifi (Renee Adore).

Dan is competing for Fifi's attention with his partner in crime, West End Bertie (the amazingly prolific silent actor Owen Moore). At times, Bertie resembles a virile, monocled Bond villain. The suave Moore makes a worthwhile nemesis for the grimy Chaney. Unlike the Blackbird, Bertie is willing to convert from the dark side, for the love of a classy woman. Of course, this turn of events arouses jealousy and leads to intensified competition between the former partners, a frame-up job, and an ironic twist of fate when the two ""brothers"" will merge into a third, ill-fated persona.

The scenes of Chaney frantically changing identities with constables from Scotland Yard waiting below are deliriously incredible. The constables buy it, and so does an audience open to allowing the capered stream to wash over it.

Browning spins his elastic yarn a bit like Albert Finney's Ed Bloom in Big Fish (2003). Aided enormously by Chaney's energetic conviction, and with his penchant for a tenebrous, commanding climate, Browning pulls the ultimate con job on his audience. During its running time we are so drawn into the commanding perversity of  Browning's fable that the inherent haziness of the narrative's essence rarely obscures his inclusive vision.
