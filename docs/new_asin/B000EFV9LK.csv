8108959,5,B000EFV9LK,"When I found myself unwillingly homebound after the Christmas holidays because of subzero weather, (on top of being recently widowed and without so much as a household pet for company), I knew I was going to need a really, really high-powered anti-depressant that would also last long enough to get me through the upcoming days and nights without losing my mind.

That was when I remembered the ""I, Claudius"" VHS tape gift set that had been sitting, unviewed, on a top shelf for at least a year. After seeing complaints by other reviewers about editing cuts in later DVD versions and agreeing with them, I came across this VHS set. However, while I immediately ordered it, I had never found the time to watch it after it arrived.

Now, after recalling how much my late husband and I enjoyed this series when it was first broadcast in the mid-1970's, as well as its length, I said ""Aha!"" because I had found my anti-depressant. With nothing but time on my hands, I pulled the ""I, Claudius"" box down from its perch on the top shelf and fired up the old VHS player. Then I put in the first tape, settled in the recliner with a cup of tea, hit the Play button on the remote and, from that moment on, it was ""Oh, my!""

If there were any way to give this VHS edition more than five stars, I would, because this production is every bit as gorgeous today as it was when I first watched it in the 1970's. The tapes ran flawlessly, the color and settings are superb and, as for the acting, what can I say?

For two entire days, I forgot my depression and, instead, became happily immersed in this magnificent historical marathon. By its exquisitely scripted portrayal of the scandalous, often shocking behavior of Ancient Rome's rich and famous as well as their high calorie lusciousness, conspicuous consumption and glory this BBC series has achieved an almost matchless level of pure entertainment and just plain fun that leaves most of today's multi-million dollar movie offerings, celebrity gossip, ""reality"" and talk shows (and, lest we forget, soap opera), in the dust.

Now my only problem is what to watch next.",1389052800,,2109,4.64343163538874
