(though I really like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood too). too bad it never quite got completed. still, it's a must for anime fans, especially of the fantasy genre.",1451260800,,305,5.244897959183674

8471320,5,B005G7WGIQ,"Amazing anime, blu-ray quality very good given the source material wasn't intended for widescreen or HD.  So glad I could finally grab this one!",1422403200,,144,5.0
8471321,5,B005G7WGIQ,"One of the greatest anime of all time. This belongs alongside the best Disney, Ghibli etc. stories. This is great to watch with your kids as well. This is one every anime fan should have in their collection.",1419120000,,207,4.473684210526316
8471322,4,B005G7WGIQ,Great series. My only problem is that the Japanese audio is 5.1 surround sound. So it sounds really weird coming out of my tv speakers which is only stereo. Same thing with my computer which only has stereo speakers. I don't know why the choice was made to make the Japanese audio playable for only surround sound 5.1. Other than that I have no problems with this.,1412640000,,364,4.447761194029851
8471323,5,B005G7WGIQ,"It is an incredible product. The story is impressive and the quality of the Blu-ray is superb. One thing you must know before buying it. Because it is an old series, the aspect of the video is 4:3 no 16:9 or 16:10. If that does not bother you (like me) it is a superb addition to your collection. The image quality is incredible and the dub in English is quite good. As a fan of anime, if you haven't bought this series, what are you waiting for do it.",1384560000,,452,4.089887640449438
8471324,5,B005G7WGIQ,"This is the second installation of The Twelve Kingdoms and by now you have a solid idea of what this anime is about. It's still really slow in unraveling what's going to happen to the protagonist (which doesn't show up all that often on this one). But the other stories in this box set is just as awesome and majestic and the protagonist. Again, the story is very slow and there is a lot of back story that's being dumped on you, but it's only to help you understand the world that the protagonist was tossed into.

Just sit back, relax and enjoy this wonderful masterpice.",1371340800,,573,4.40566037735849
8471325,5,B005G7WGIQ,"I was truly blown away by this. My girlfriend came in around episode 13 during a recap and was like OMG how can you remember all those weird terms.
I admit normally this would be frustrating and a problem, however when you start to get it it is so rewarding. This show is so good it creates a desire to have a deeper understanding of the world and does not feel like a chore at all. And trust me, I hate learning new things.
When you can explain the difference between Keiki and Renrin, and why they are names what they are, you are winning!",1357862400,,541,4.161904761904762
8471326,5,B005G7WGIQ,"This is an amazing anime that I would recommend to anyone.

Amazon has fast shipping, they shipped my copy on 10/18/2011 and it arrived on 10/21/2011.
