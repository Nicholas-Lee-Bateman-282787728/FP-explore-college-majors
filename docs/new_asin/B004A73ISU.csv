8419549,2,B004A73ISU,"Gilles Beat's Diamant 13 sees Gerard Depardiueu as our old friend the burnt-out cop who just doesn't care anymore (his motto: ""I don't need anybody's help to fall""), insulting hostages and encouraging would-be suicides to jump, drinking himself from night to day before going home to his lonely apartment like he was a character in a 1970s Joseph Wambaugh novel relocated to France. Maybe someday someone will break the mould and make a movie about a cheerful cop with a happy home life and plenty of friends who follows the rules, has the full support of his superiors and still gets the job done, but in the meantime we've got another run through all the usual modern downbeat cop movie clich&eacute;s. The result is watchable but hard to summon up much enthusiasm for despite a script touch-up by co-star and 36 Quai des Orfevres/MR73 writer-director Olivier Marchal, who plays a dying corrupt cop who tries to rope Depardieu into hijacking a drugs shipment only to go it disastrously solo when his ex-partner finds himself up on disciplinary charges and offered a deal by unlikely public prosecutor and even more unlikely ex-wife Asia Argento - his hide for Marchal's. But this being the kind of film that never sticks with a single moral dilemma when it can throw in another plot to try that on for size before its attention strays to something else, he soon finds himself the target of a drug lord who wants the drugs and cash Marchal stole back - or else. And then finds himself on the trail of documents incriminating most of the city's rich and powerful in one of those vague conspiracies in high places that French films habitually never bother to properly define. And then finds old friends and a hooker he's befriended targeted by a killer who may be... you get the picture. You've seen it all before often enough.

A Franco-Belgian co-production shot in tax-shelter-friendly Luxemburg, Diamant 13 is seemingly an attempt by the usually classy MK2 Productions, whose idea of a crime movie usually didn't extend far beyond Claude Chabrol's petit bourgeoisie affairs, to get down and dirty, but it simply embraces a different set of unconvincing clich&eacute;s. It's set in the kind of police stations where they only use 20watt bulbs and streets where the streetlamps give no light, but its aspirations to gritty realism are belied by surveillance videos that are of theatrical quality complete with professional editing and camera movement and the kind of zoom lenses that NASA would envy. There are some promising ideas that the film never really follows through, and Anne Coesens gives a better performance as Depardieu's partner than the underwritten part demands, but mostly this is just tired and uninspired. Depardieu himself hasn't looked this unhealthy for years, and you get the impression it's nothing to do with the part. But maybe he just couldn't get any more excited about the film than audiences or critics. Workmanlike stuff.

While the Italian and French DVDs have no English language option, the deleted Canadian NTSC DVD and Australian PAL DVD have English subtitles and an acceptable but not great 2.35:1 widescreen transfer.",1351555200,,3157,4.9772727272727275
