8146223,4,B000ILYYT4,"Burroughs, Gysin, Hamri, and the Master Musicians of Joujouka. Basically the Tangiers-Burroughs connection. It includes one of the last interviews with Burroughs and some rarely seen footage from the 1950s and 1960s. Short but reasonably good intro to the early Tangiers Burroughs, albeit made much later in time.",1253577600,6,313,5.541666666666667
