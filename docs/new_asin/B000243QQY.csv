It starts by describing this observation light airplane (basically a civilian aircraft). It was used in Korea for artillery spotting. Can you believe all log books? Are there old, bold pilots? One L-5 flies a loop, then upside down! Stunt flights are a violation of flying regulations. (Unneeded stress on the airframe.) You see the personal relationships among the men. When two L-5s are diverted we see combat on the ground. There are casualties from a sneak attack. Two civilians are transported - the Ambassador and the Korean president. Later on L-5 fires an attached bazooka at a tank, then is hit by machine gun fire. Can the pilot be rescued? There is a need to bring medical supplies to soldiers behind the lines.

A crashed L-5 provides parts to repair another. The base is attacked at night! Can a wounded man be flown out for proper medical care at night? The obstacles are overcome. They must take photos of the area behind the lines. Are there enemy tanks there? Can they be located for F-80's so bombs and rockets are dropped? Can a wounded pilot land his L-5?

This provides a view of the Korean War for those who were not there. Was it sort of like a documentary rather than a message movie?",1390003200,,1239,4.622727272727273
8021908,5,B000243QQY,...bought this for a WWII vet that flew the L-5 Sentinel in Okinawa.  He thoroughly enjoyed it -- even the impossible flying scenes like where the L-5 was flying upside down which is a neat trick for a plane with a gravity feed fuel system.  If you're an L-bird fan you'll enjoy this movie.,1218153600,4,290,4.351851851851852
