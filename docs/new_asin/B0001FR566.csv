Marilyn is beautiful, funny, and charming as the ""sex symbol"" of the house.  This is a cute romantic comedy - a sweet, simple movie about love, money, and trust.  Would you trust your husband living next door to sexy Marilyn Monroe??",971222400,18,385,4.984375

1995768,5,B0001FR566,"An enjoyable and fun movie.  The DVD cover needs to be changed to reflect the movie.  Marilyn Monroe had a small part, and although her acting was good, she was part of the supporting cast and not the main characters - Haver and Lundigen - the owners of the Love Nest that housed several eccentric tenants.  No need to fool the buyers into thinking it's a Monroe film.",1385856000,4,368,4.382352941176471
1995769,3,B0001FR566,"Billed for Marilyn, but she is just a small part, and the performance that really shone was June Haver as the owner of the ""Love Nest"".",1370044800,,135,4.230769230769231
1995770,3,B0001FR566,"""Love Nest"" is a 1951 low-budget black-and-white comedy film that starred June Haver, William Lundigan, Frank Fay, Marilyn Monroe, Jack Paar, and Leatrice Joy. The movie was directed by Joseph Newman and released by 20th Century-Fox.

Does this movie have a good plot? Well, it has a minor one that gets somewhat dull after 10 or 15 minutes.

Does it have good quality? Yes, this B&W movie has an A- quality.

Does it have good stars? June Haver, who garners top billing and dominates the film, is a good looking lady who was a star of musicals in the 1940s. William Lundigan, who never really became anything big co-stars. Let's not forget Marilyn Monroe and Jack Paar who would soon become Hollywood's biggest sex goddess and TV star, respectively. Silent stars Frank Fay and Leatrice Joy also co-star.

****For the record, I must tell other buyers of this product that I strictly bought this movie because of Marilyn Monroe. I got into June Haver a good bit afterwards. And I must also say that Miss Monroe doesn't show much in this movie, she's maybe on screen for 7 or 8 minutes. And in the movie's opening credits she doesn't receive over-the-title billing, she get ""With..."" billing directly after the title. So if you like to see old fashioned romantic comedy-dramas this movie MIGHT be worth the buy? MIGHT!",1346457600,6,1316,4.758771929824562
1995771,4,B0001FR566,"Any movie going through the hands of Diamond is worth viewing,and it's with good reason that billy wilder later partnered with him on so many films. He was raised in Romania and his films and it doesnt take much to see this have many european influences,which shoots through his writing like a comet in the nighting lighting up all kinds of aspects of life,and i do recall years ago an interview with billy wilder on 60 minutes in which he stated messages do not belong in movies my movies have no messages just entertainment. It is good for 20th century fox to bring out this film which has an early marilyn monroe and which showcases her here briefly,and she is good in the scenes she's in and these themes she would later take up in Some like it hot(1955)a film largely about the fantasizing mind since nothing really does happen in that film. How the fantasizing mind leads people astray. Here we have a good natured returning war vet,a nice man,who dislikes polygamous people and the story has him coming back home where his wife has just purchased an apartment house,and the fbi come snooping and he thinks they are after this polygamous
person,yet the writer tries to show this writer is polygamous on a fantasy level which has him bring the
startling beautiful marilyn(and she appears very radiant in this film)to the apartment. Someone who during the war he confides with a confidant. On the scene we also have a character,an ethnic character who intrudes on the neighbourhood in all kinds of ways with his values,and this point is labored throughout and actually tries to impose some values on the neighbourhood,the only character so interested. The police are here...and this person is jailed and we don't actually know what he's done...woman were supposedly swindled,however they voluntarily gave up their money,'women who drove their husbands to an early grave,so this character plays a mediating role in bringing justice on a moral level...and finds himself in jail. This seems to be  a place where the soldier's wife,her husband is a clux of sorts, a writer,good at stories,and the woman finds where paying taxes with no services to speak of,and she talks of people trapped,we need a private investigator whom her husband says she resembles...and at the end of the film the jailed ethnic character in a comment on what the film is all about says his 'sentimental attachment' is toward his house..and at film end toward the two children in the baby carriage which the writer prefigures is a kind of guardian for the area. Some very talented writers in very short duration can do very good moral dramas and mr diamond is all too good..the film is a spoof and comedy...like much od his work...and much of his work deals with how various layers or strata(a word he would like)infect daily life..and an interesting note that the various males or females view the same things and experience the same things but draw different conclusions and assess it in different ways...a good comedy by one of hollywood's best,of course you can watch it all as a surface comedy,and as billy wilder would say movies are just for entertainment! By the way this is not his film...Marilyn is great in her scenes and these brief scenes is why she soon replaced betty grable..although she often bailed out of 20th's productions,her own revenge on the male world of hollywood,..of course if she didn't exact this kind of revenge in other ways is unknown...as a person though i like her and her movies as she always someone who has some values...",1334275200,,3533,4.820428336079077
1995772,5,B0001FR566,"This is a fun and cute movie.  A young and relatively unknown Marilyn Monroe and also Jack Paar have roles in it.  If you love old movies like I do, you'll enjoy this one.",1311638400,3,171,4.0
1995773,4,B0001FR566,"Although I enjoy this movie, the honest truth of it all like one reviewer tried to impart, the deal of it is is that MM had a secondary role in this movie; This was one of her first flicks, but in this one, she has a bit more of a prominent role; In this movie, William Lundigan comes home to June Haver who buys an apartment trying to make it work and be profitable; She bought more than enough trouble in my opinion. MM was an ex servicemans buddy that he raved about not stating that the ""buddy"" is a she, an ex-WAC. but ok, life goes on and MM tend to stays to herself and not break up homes. The meat of the movie revolves around a man who moves in, who clearly has eyes on one woman that lives there but is by all accounts, a gigolo and earns money from rich women. When things hit the fan, things get hairy but as Hollywood does, it come tied down in a neat little bow at the end. When I first saw it on TMC, to be honest, they didn't mention MM on the initial credits, but because she is in the movie, they bill it as such.",1242086400,2,1031,3.937799043062201

1995775,4,B0001FR566,"Love Nest is a good little comedy that probably would have been long forgotten if Marilyn Monroe fans did not buy it. The cover is misleading because Marilyn never appears in uniform in the movie. Her part is small, but like all her early roles, she used every second of her camera time to make herself known, thus becoming the star we all love.

Mr. Scott is a vet returning from World War II. His wife has purchased a tenant house in the city, a fixer upper. The rent from the tenants will permit Mr. Scott to pursue his writing. Among the tenants are Edie the widow and her daughter, Marilyn who is a returning WAC, causing some jealousy from Mrs. Scott, a con man, and the ""Mm-Hmm Man"". The only two lines the guy has in the movie is ""Mm-Hmm"".

The con man goes after old widows and scams them out of their money. He claims he is doing it for all men, because the men worked themselves into an early grave, leaving their wives with money they did not earn or deserve. He begins his scam on Edie, but after realizing she is poor, he ends up falling in love with her an eventually marries her.

Meanwhile poor Mr. Scott has his hands full with the house. The plumbing is bad, the coal is delivered in through the bedroom window, and the place is about to be condemned because of bad wiring. His writing isn't going so well either. His first story has been rejected. He and his wife begin fighting and he leaves to sleep outside in his hammock. Unfortunately,  Suds the cat decides to wreck havoc on him. Mr. Scott ends up sleeping in Marilyn's apartment while she is away for the weekend. He gets caught by his wife, but she has bigger news. She has caught on to the con man's game. Seems the feds have too and shortly after he and Edie marry, the police arrest him. All seems lost, but it works out well in the end.

Mr. Scott writes the con man's story and it turns into a  national bestseller. They have plenty of money to fix up the tenant house and everyone lives happily ever after. The con man and Edie are seen walking down the street with their newborn twins.

Marilyn looks great as always. She only appears in this movie for a total of maybe ten minutes, but for Marilyn fans who love to see her in her early work like I do, this is a great addition to your collection.",1149206400,3,2282,4.268518518518518
1995776,3,B0001FR566,"as a younger viewer (not born until the 1970's) I am just discovering Monroes films. I like ""7 year itch"", ""Niagra"" and ""dont bother to knock"", but this film doesn't have enough Monroe. If they didn't put her on the cover and pretend it was a Monroe film Im sure alot less people would have purhchased it. She isn't even well casted for the role. She doesn't look like she would have been a WAC.

The film is okay, but its nothing worth owning. The plot is really stupid and the jokes aren't that great. All the actors did a great job, but there is only so much you can do with a silly premise like this...",1147824000,16,606,4.17948717948718
8011709,5,B0001FR566,"While really a ""B"" movie, it is fairly entertaining.  If you expect to see allot of Marilyn  Monroe to be in allot of the movie, you'll be disappointed, but she is good in the few sciens she is in.",1516406400,,197,4.0256410256410255

8011713,4,B0001FR566,This is a movie to see for several reasons. First is for the commentary by the director Joseph Newman. His days in Hollywood working with all the greats is insightful. I got it to see Frank Fay one of the most famous stars of stage who was the first husband of Barbara Stanwyck. It was great to have a glimpse into his charm and delivery. Very competent. Leatrice Joy another early star was great to see too. Then the amazing Jack Paar who later became so well known as the first talk show host. The chemistry between Lundigan and Haver was good and they carry the picture well. Seeing Marilyn Monroe is good too although she had quite a small role. All in all it is much better than one might think.,1472083200,,700,4.3106060606060606

8011716,5,B0001FR566,"This was just a simple romantic tale, no singing and dancing, which is usual with June Haver.  But it was relaxing to watch how the two young people work to save their home that seems to be falling down around them.  Sometimes you just need to sit back and enjoy!  It is an  OLDIE but a  GOODIE!",1413158400,2,295,4.105263157894737
8011717,4,B0001FR566,"Marilyn Monroe in her 12th screen role appearance. Her popularity was definitely on the rise and in 1951, was her 3rd movie behind ""Hometown Story"" and ""As Young as You Feel"". Marilyn plays a supporting role as most of her movies have been since ""Ladies of the Chorus"". She plays an ex Army WAC and friend of the returning husband. She finds herself renting one of the apartments in the building her friend's wife had bought. The wife finds out and things get a little dicey, but hey, it's all in good fun. It's a cute movie and I can see why Marilyn's star was on the way up.
