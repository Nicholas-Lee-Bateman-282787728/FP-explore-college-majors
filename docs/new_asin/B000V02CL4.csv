8653596,5,B000V02CL4,"I had seen This EXercise performed on a PBS Station for a few days. And I never got to see the whole DVD. So I ordered it and am very satisfied .  I had  Lap Band surgery In Nov 09 and I wanted to be able to tighten up my stomach more . And doing these procedures through out the day is very easy and very effective.  I know  there where other comments from others who said they could do the same with other or similar exercises, and I believe U can but this was very easy for  "" me "".  It does not require laying on the floor  ( as I have had a knee replacement) and It is something U can do all the time and actually when driving and when lying down and sitting in a chair or when standing in line.  If U are lucky enough to view the DVD w/ out purchasing good because it is not long and when U see it once U got it down.  maybe U can go in w/ one or more persons and share the cost . It's not something U have to constantly review . One look and U got it. This routine  helps  anyone who sits alot/or stand or if U are chair bound Any age,young or old, If your a walker. It helps w/ posture also. I  have already tightened up my stomach and my hips/buttocks.  If your looking for a no brainer .  This is it. And U can very easily show someone else how to do it.  This is really a no Equipment needed exercise.  :-)",1279670400,3,1317,3.786764705882353

I'd been suffering from Knee and back issues and she's the only one who sorted out my knee. Yes, my knee. Given how important posture is for your limbs to have a strong base to work from, improving my posture improved my knee. I also do her exercises regularly because I sit a lot (Medical student) and I find if I don't do her exercises I get a sore lower back.

The added burning calories is a bonus. Essentially humans are meant to move - continually. With all the sitting we do nowadays we don't even resist gravity anymore. With your posture and muscles working properly, you can resist gravity - essentially a constant, low level workout. Think of the difference between slouching in a couch, where it is friction holding you in place, versus sitting up straight, with your muscles doing the work.",1271894400,2,896,4.530864197530864
