8194110,5,B000Q5GOUE,"This dvd with all of Benny's radio shows plus the audio of many of his television appearance is just great!  I found it interesting from a historical and evolutionary perspective of Benny's career, but more importantly, I laughed all the way through.  Great value.",1437782400,,264,4.9772727272727275
8194111,4,B000Q5GOUE,"I thought this might play in a car with an mp3/DVD player, but it did not. I am not at all tech savvy , so thanks to an employee at Best Buy who told me how to easily transfer the shows to a flash drive, we can now listen to them in the car. The  sound quality is not the best on some of them,  but what can you expect from an old radio show?  For the price and quantity of shows, you can't find a better deal .( I have spent $35 to $40 each on CD collections with only  about a dozen of these shows on them.)",1432425600,,509,3.6422018348623855
8194112,5,B000Q5GOUE,"There was an abundance of material, all enjoyable.",1410739200,,50,5.375
8194113,5,B000Q5GOUE,"460 hours, 39 minutes and 48 seconds to be precise.  I don't know if this is EVERY Jack Benny radio show but there's enough to satisfy you.  For example, there are 43 1941 shows.  Did JB skip 9 weeks that year or are their a few shows missing?  Don't know.

Disc includes things other than JB's radio show.  For example, there are a couple of Tonight show appearances from the 1970s (audio only)

Besides the entertaining show you also get the interesting perspective of the commercials - a 1934 jello ad is something different!

Quality:  Mixed.  The MP3s have a very low bitrate but that's ok considering the source material.  Some of shows have noise (I recognized the swooshing of a warped record on one file) but they're listenable.  Others are of good quality.

These are mp3 files burned to a DVD.  You'll have to copy them to a computer, Ipod, cellphone or something like that to listen to them unless your dvd player plays mp3s.",1326326400,,937,4.566265060240964
8194114,4,B000Q5GOUE,"This collection of shows on DVD is huge- over 200 shows, and the audio quality is very good, considering the source. But- I can only get it to play in my computer or DVD player, it will not play in any portable MP3 player I have- meaning it will not play in the car.  It is actually a DVD, not an MP3. If you are in Los Angeles, some of the shows were recorded at the Pasadena Playhouse, which closed just this week.",1265760000,,416,4.0120481927710845
8194115,1,B000Q5GOUE,I went in to this purchase skeptical and I wasn't disappointed.  While the quantity of programs is staggering - the quality is comparable to listening to these recordings on old scratched vinyl with a knitting needle taped to a cow horn.  I would not recommend the purchase of this item.,1238112000,4,287,4.72
8194116,5,B000Q5GOUE,I gave this a 5 star rating becouse i love being able to hear programs like this that are very rarly aired on media broadcasts. Jack Benney is great and it would be tragic if this material was lost. The audio quality is not up to todays standards but what can be expected from programs of that time period.,1232755200,4,306,4.203389830508475
