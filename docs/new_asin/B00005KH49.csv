I am 31 and I used to watch this show when I was about 6 or 7 and I remembered alot of the series!!!!!! Like I said, Dragons Domain ,the best of the first season,I used to have the lunch box with the one eyed creature! [...] thumbs up to space 1999!!!",996537600,5,422,3.8068181818181817
1619851,3,B00005KH49,"The fourth and final volume of the first season episodes (A&E has confirmed it will release the entire second season on DVD as well) continues the trippy trek across the stars for the beleaguered Moonbase Alpha; it also signals the end of the metaphysical, drug-inspired plots, impressive special effects and most of the cast. Martin Landau's John Koenig continues to bark and grimace, Barbara Bain sustains her zombie impersonation and Barry Morse maintains the only likeable character, Professor Victor Bergman. Episodes like ""The Troubled Spirit"" and ""The Testament of Arkadia"" continue denying scientific reasoning, but the series' writers never cared about plausibility anyway, so why continue to bluster about inaccuracies? Much of Space:1999's weird plots would turn into just plain silly plots when its second season premiered. Bergman and the entire cast, save for Landau and Bain, would be dumped for Maya, the alien with the cool sideburns and Tony Verdeshi, Koenig's number one. The special effects wouldn't be, well, as special in the second season and the Main Mission set is replaced with a cheap-looking, multi-light-blinking Command Center(but those jackets everybody wears are retro cool). Oh well. At least Landau SMILES in the second season (When Space: 1999 aired in Canada in the early-mid Nineties, the second season prints looked murky, not as clean looking as season one-- I hope the future DVDs will rectify the problem). Regardless if you prefer season one's metaphysical pondering or season two's more traditional sci-fi adventure, Space: 1999 is pure kitsch and a delight to watch all over again on DVD.",995673600,2,1632,5.329457364341085
1619852,3,B00005KH49,"Space: 1999 was and still is my favotite television show. For years I've waited impatiently for its relesaes on video, especially the episodes Dragon's Domain and War Games. However, I'm rather disappointed with the final product released by A&E. My main gripe is the inferior quality of the picture, especially during scenes of space flight. The color may be green, half black, red or blue, or red and blue together! This is irritating. When one should be concentrating on Brian Johnson's great special effects, one is distracted by a truncated picture that inhibits suspension of disbelief. (Some episodes are either free of this problem or are marginally affected. Unfortunately, War Games is not one of the unaffected episodes and Dragon's Domain is passable.)Secondly, A&E says up to twelve minutes not shown when the series was first broadcast are included in the new videos. I can't find the new scenes? However, I'm old enough to remember scenes from the original broadcasts of the show that aren't in A&Es videos (In fact, in the trailer to BREAKAWAY several scenes of an Eagle slamming it's tethered nuclear waste containment canister into the laser barrier are not in the episode itself, and I remember those scenes from the original broadcast in '75). I hope A&E will fix these problems in the near future.",994723200,4,1318,5.0228310502283104

I had nightmares about that episode for months after seeing it as a kid.  It was exceptionally well done.  I hope very, very much they release the second season, as that was my favorite!  To anyone hesitant about the dvd collections, let me point out they offer better quality, more episodes and extras, and are safer over the long term than mere video tape.  We've waited this long--we deserve the best.  I even bought a dvd player just to watch these collections.",992649600,6,602,4.695238095238095
1619855,5,B00005KH49,"This DVD will contain one of my all-time favorite episodes of Space: 1999, ""Dragon's Domain"", whose hideous octopod space monster frightened the wits out of me and several of my friends who also beheld this episode here in Canada in 1977. Other reasons why this episode was so striking were the relationship between Koenig and Russell, more outwardly affectionate and a precursor to the fully blossomed romance between them in Year 2, and the wearing of anoraks as seen  frequently in the second season. I hope that the success of these DVDs will guarantee a FULL release of Year 2 as well, as that was the season that pulled me and my friends into the fantastic future of Space: 1999, bonded us to the characters of Koenig and Russell, and impressed upon us the boundlessness of space and its potential life forms.
Bring on ""Dragon's Domain"" and ALL of Year 2 and the mantra that should be tagged to these:

1619867,5,B00005KH49,"The breakdown:  due to storing too much volatile nuclear material on the moon, and a freak increase of magnetic activity (to the point where beams of lightning get shot across the moonscape) the nuclear waste is ignited and the subsequent massive explosion shoots the moon out of orbit and on an uncharted journey through the far reaches of space.  If you can get past this ""scientifically impossible"" (as Asimov called it) premise, then Space: 1999 is the show for you.  Now in the fourth set, some of the finest episodes of the series.  Without a doubt, ""The Troubled Spirit"" represents some of the creepiest and finest writing of this or any series pre-X-Files.  Although on the surface a seeming attempt to cash in on the Exorcist hoopla still going strong at the time, this episode raises the bar considerably with the idea of a spirit coming back in time to haunt the present for a crime not committed yet.  The opening musical score for the episode is just plain fantastic!  ""Space Brain"" is the notorious episode with all the foam and bubbles.  The title pretty much explains the plot.  The effects of the brain itself are pretty creative (and minimalist!) and Barry Gray's special score for this episode is particularly engaging.  The ""Infernal Machine"" is a bit more pedestrian with the alien visiting the moonbase.  Two unusuals for this episode:  the always excellent Leo McKern and the very nice set design inside of Gwent's spaceship.  ""Mission of the Darians"" (with guest Joan Collins) is another notorious episode (with another great set design!) that took its cue from the Soylent Green movie-`nuff said on that.  ""Dragon's Domain"" is the one episode that everyone remembers from when they watched this series as young children.  It is still a truly frightening episode to behold.  Also, one of the problems that dogged this series, plot and continuity problems, is evident here unfortunately.  ""Testament of Arkadia"" was the final episode for the first season.  As the story unwinds slowly, you will see why this was a great way to end the season.  Again, the music is very engaging.  There would be a second season of Space: 1999 with many drastic changes, most notably the departure of three major characters and the addition of two more.",1119657600,,2258,4.8921052631578945
1619868,4,B00005KH49,"This is my favorite set of the entire series. Volume seven is good, but volume eight has some of the best episodes of the series. I love the first season, but I always wished the characters could have evolved more. It always seemed like we would have an episode where characters would show some life, but then that life would gone in the next episode. Here is my breakdown of the episodes on this set.
The troubled spirit- Another one of those episodes about some kind of possession that causes an Alphan to go off or at least a part of them goes off and terrorizes the base. This is one of those gothic horrors set in space that Space 1999 could do so very well. This episode is predictable, but well paced and interesting.
Space brain- Yeah, I know, everyone is walking through soap suds pretending they are being attacked by an alien entity. If you can look past the suds then it really is a fair episode.
Infernal machine- An immensely powerful machine loses it's companion and now it needs another. A bit slow at first, but it eventually develops into a very strong episode.
Now we come to the final three episodes of season one and all three of these would be in my top five favorite episodes of the entire show.
Mission of the Darians- The Alphans discover a huge spaceship and we discover cannibalism, sacrifices, false gods and two entirely different societies living on the same ship. Joan Collins is perfect as Kara, an arrogant member of the dominating society of the ship. This episode is solid from start to finish. Not entirely original, but a fine story with some good performances. This episode is maybe more of a standard Space 1999 episode than the last two and I love some of the sets in this episode.
Dragon's domain- Often considered to be the best episode of the series, and I believe that title should go to either this episode or Black sun. That may be a bit hard to believe when you consider the main character is not a regular and that the bulk of the story is told through flashbacks. Tony Cellini swears a monster killed the rest of the crew of a mission he was on and now he feels the monster has returned and he must confront it. Great story, very grim at times with solid performances from all involved.
Testement of arkadia- The first season comes to a close with an episode that like Dragon's domain seems very different from the rest of the season, but it is still one of the best. Alpha is drawn to a planet and the base is losing power. On the planet, they discover links that indicate that humans may have come from this planet and two crewmembers believe this is where they should settle. We have an episode where crewmembers are creating a problem, but becuase they felt it is their fate rather than the usual plot where we crewmembers are driven by possession of alien force. We have the absense of any tangible alien force, some different music and even some voice over by Koenig all of these things give this episode very different, but almost stylish feel. It's much more a thinking episode than a visual episode.
  And so the first season comes to an end and makes me wish we could have had a second season that picked where this one ended and then season two may have been great. Instead ratings were not good enough and the Andersons got divorced. The only way to get a second season was to hand the reins over to Fred Freiberger and he had to promise a number of changes that he thought could help the ratings. Paul, Kano and Victor (my favorite) were all gone (without explanation) and they were replaced my Maya and Tony. Uniforms, the theme an main mission were changed. Helena and Koenig's relationship jumped ahead several notches and the whole feel of the show changed. Sandra only appeared ina few episodes, Alan was never quite the same and most of the other secondary characters would change every couple of episodes. It did have it's share of good episodes, but season one ruled.",1044662400,3,3937,4.512605042016807
1619869,4,B00005KH49,"Set 4 of the Space:1999 rounds out the final 6 episodes from the first season. There are some memorable stories, such as Space Brain and fan favorite Dragon's Domain. The stories still have a pedestrian pace, the dialogue is atrocious and some of the acting questionable. But the production and special effects are top notch.
Though, I have to question about the actual prints. Overall, they look great, but episodes like the Testament of Arkadia has a very dark look to it, almost if the transfer from film to DVD wasn't done properly. Or was it always this dark? Also, very few extras. It's a shame really, as Space:1999 DVDs released in the UK and Japan have far more extras, and the selection screens far more creative. France has just released the entire series on one huge boxset with loads of extras, including an episode of UFO. Still, without A&E's release of this program, I probably wouldn't have been drawn back into it. It's stills loads of mindless fun...",1027468800,,969,4.739644970414201
1619870,5,B00005KH49,"Okay, you bought set 1, 2, and 3 - you've got to have number 4!
The eagles alone are worth watching and in this set you can see Joan Collins in a not so pretty light. Yes Joan Collins of Dynasty. She did the original Star Trek and Space:1999.
Barry Greys theme and accompaning score are wonderful. The old animated laser blasts are kind of funny, but much more sophisticated than the sparks and wires we saw in the original Flash Gordon serials.
Get this one too!",1023840000,,463,4.333333333333333
1619871,5,B00005KH49,"That one-eyed monster scared me to death!
Granted it's funny to watch now, but even today the special effects hold up well.  The moonbase only looks slightly like a miniaturized model, you can't see any wires on the Eagles, the spaceflights and planets looked realistic.  Quite frankly, the series looks a lot more ""real"" than a lot of the computer generated images you see today.  Imagine what they were like back in 1975.  I can remember...
I was very young when I saw ""Dragon's Domain"", arguably the most memorable and celebrated episode.  It was the only Space 1999 episode I watched as a child that I can still remember to this day.  To see that screaming monster hypnotizing the crew members, sucking them into who-knows-what, and spitting out their charred remains.  Then to see both Koenig and Tony Ceilini hacking away at this thing, with blood pouring out and Koenig's axe going straight into the monster's glowing eyeball.  I can't remember an episode of any television program that was so graphic. I had nightmares for weeks!
It's *so* unfortunate the second season was so incredibly bad.  This was truly sci-fi at it's best!",1020470400,2,1137,4.849740932642487
1619872,5,B00005KH49,"This is like a childhood dream come true-Space 1999 is back! Space 1999 is the trippiest sci-fi show of all time and can only be compared to the great 2001! Many of the episodes seemed like bad acid trips ,espicially the Gurdian of Piri. When space 1999  came out it was a big hit and got endorsments from big name scientists. Everything about the show looked and seemed real from the unisex costumes that the Star Trek movie would copy 3 years later to the realistic looking spaceships and hardware. Even life in space was portrayed realisticly, mentioning issues such as recycling in a limited enviroment and convincing low gravity effects. In this set we have a weird ghost story set in a creepy haunted greenhouse,The Troubled Spirit. Mission of the Darians , a survival story with huge creepy sets and Joan Collins!!  Dragons' Domain is about a terrible monster lurking in a graveyard of spaceships, a galactic Bermuda Triangle. The story will be familiar to fans of the first three Alien films. The last episode The Testament of Arkadia is the conclusion to the first year-the secrete behind the Alphans' voyage is revealed. During the second year things get even weirder as Maya the shape shifter comes to live on Alpha. Second year producer Fred Freiberger also Star Treks producer, created this character based on greek mythology. Maya was unique in sci-fi, she cold transform herself in the blink of an eye, into any living creature. The editing to do this was very creative since they did not have computers back then. Maya turned out to be so innovative 15 years later  2 sci-fi shows would copy her.  Hurry up A anmd E we want our Maya!!",1000944000,6,1650,4.71875
1619873,3,B00005KH49,"Let me start by saying that the quality of the transfer is top notch, and that I have no problem with Space: 1999 in general. What I'd like to comment on are the 'extras' included on many DVDs. Prior to buying Space:1999 Set 4, I purchased the entire A&E Monty Python 14 DVD boxed set and was disappointed as well. Aside from some live performances, the additional material on each disc is simply taken from another disc in the set, a cheesy move on A&E's part. Apparently they didn't anticipate someone purchasing every disc in the collection, because this is nothing more than duplication. On Space:1999 they followed suit by including still images of the episodes already included on the disc--lame! One or two were behind the scenes, but nothing impressive. The only other additional material included is all the 'previews' of the first season. I even would have prefered the text of an interview with Martin or Barbara over that. Basically, I'm saying that A&E does not put much effort into their DVD releases and that I would look for other DVD publishers before buying theirs (I know Space:1999 episodes are available through a different publisher in England, and the collection includes a wealth of extra material). A&E doesn't get DVD.",999734400,3,1244,4.872641509433962
1619874,4,B00005KH49,"I am very glad to see this series available on dvd.. while the video xfer is very good, but not as good as sets 1 and 2 though, i am kinda dissapointed at the mono sound track.  a&e needs to take a look at the work done to the original star trek series remastered in 5.1dd and the original show was in mono so if they can do it for that series why did you fall down on the audio portion of this series? still just glad to have them... The cheesey effects are worth it alone and being able to clearly see the strings on the eagles as well. all the cheesey efx goes to point out one thing though we all ignored them because when this series and others like it came out the actors and actresses were actually required to know how to act and unlike todays series that if the special fx fail as does the show all of these 60's and 70's shows were quite entertaining! i love the corney lighted octo-monster as i did the human carrot from lost in space and i look forward to season 2 with the morphing babe!!",999302400,,1001,4.055555555555555
1619875,5,B00005KH49,"It's sure great to get the complete first season on DVD, but even though A and E never said anything about the Season One Documentary, all these other DVD ordering places are. I don't know were they are getting their info, but there is no Documentary on the last season one DVD. I sincerely hope to see the Fanderson Documentary (or whatever) shows up on the future Year 2 DVD sets. The trailers are pretty cool, though. All 24 of them. All four of these box sets are a must have....",997228800,5,483,4.318681318681318
1619876,5,B00005KH49,"Oh joy!!!  I thought Sets 1 & 2 were good, I thought set 3 was excellent, but this set has my favourite episodes.
""The Troubled Spirit"":  An Alpha technician attempts telepathic communication with plants and unleases a leathal supernatural force.
I'm not going to descible this episode in any more detail because I want people who have never seen this before to really enjoy it without any ""plot-spoilers"".  Ok, the idea of talking to plants seems laim, but boy does this episode work.  The atmosphere is dark and sinister and the ""unusual"" music provides a suitable background for this totally original storyline.
""The Space Brain"":  The moon's path is going to take it through a giant, living, cosmic entity.  Like most lifeforms, even something that lives in space has a defence mechanism to protect against foreign infections...
OK, this episode is bad.  It's really bad.  It's awfull!  Someone, somewhere managed to get hold of a foam making machine and sat down and wrote a script around it.  This is the result!  My best tip for viewing this episode is to drink a 10 pack of beer first (on an empty stomach) and then it makes a pretty good comedy.  I have a feeling that because they spent so much money making ""War Games"" on Set 3, they only had $25 dollars left to make this whole episode.
""The Infernal Machine"":  An alien spacecraft lands on the moon, seeking help for it's sick occupant.  Unfortunately the occupant is simply a ""companion"" for the living spacecraft and he's about to die.  Gwent, the spacecraft, decides to keep Koenig, Russell and Bergman as it's new companions.
Leo McKern is excellent as both the Companion and as the voice of Gwent.  Good sets and strong performances by all more than make up for the poor previous episode.
""Mission of the Darians"":  The moon comes across the distress signal of a 100 square mile spacecraft.  Konenig leads a rescue party to the ship and finds it a victim of massive damage and in a state of decay.  The party splits up and Helena and a security guard are captured by primitive savages.  Koenig and Bergman are found by the surviving crew who ask for Aplha's help to complete their mission to colonise a new world.  What is the connection between the ultra-advanced crew and the savage primatives?
Another of my personal favourites (and not because of Joan Collin's short skirt and long legs), this episode examines the results of an overwhelming disaster on a civilized culture and to what lengths people will go to survive (and justify their actions).  The actor playing the primitive priest is excellent as he terrorises Dr Russell and Barbara Bain is at her best as she witnesses the murder of one of her party while she ponders over her own chances for survival.
""Dragon's Domain"":  Eagle pilot Cellini is haunted by memories of a previous encounter with an alien entity while commanding an Earth probe-ship.  His fears become stronger when the moon appears to find the same group of abandoned spacecraft that cost him the lives of his crew.  Koenig doesn't believe that the ships can be the same ones that his old friend Cellini had described years before.  However, Cellini steals and Eagle and heads out into space to confront his old nemesis and extract revenge.  As Alpha's course brings it nearer to the ships graveyard, Koenig spots the unmistakable hull of Cellini's old probe-ship docked to an alien vessel...
An action packed story with some nice ""flashback"" sequences of Cellini, Koenig and Bergman on Earth discussing the failed probe expedition with authorities.  As bug-eyed, green monsters go, you can't get much more bug-eyed or greener than this one and the ""sterotype"" description of the alien is used in the story as proof to Earth authorities that Cellini was covering up for a personal error resulting the deaths of his crew by fabricating an account of his escape from the creature.  Seat-gripping stuff!
""Testament of Arkadia"":  The Alphans find a dead planet that once supported life.  Two members of the landing party discover a cave which seems to contain the decayed remains of humans and a stone message enscribed with an ancient Earth language.  Later, they same two people start to have strange visions...
I'm still not sure whether this episode is a pure classic or just a well made romp through an old ""life on Earth started in outer space"" script.  Either way, it's entertaining stuff with some good performances.  A good end to an excellent season which should have remained the template for the next season.",997228800,3,4514,4.82704811443433

7943201,5,B00005KH49,"Space 1999 was a 70's sci fi series produced at Pinewood Studios the home of another famous franchise the James Bond series.  The story is set on Moonbase Alpha, a base built on Earth's moon apparently used for the storage of nuclear waste.  Low and behold the nuclear waste dump blows up and launches the entire moon out of its orbit around Earth and off into the universe where the inhabitants of Moonbase Alpha faced a new adventure every week.  Martin Landau played John Koenig the base commander.  Barbara Bain played Helena Russell the head of medical.  Landau and Bain were married at the time and had appeared together on the Mission Impossible series of the sixties.  A couple of noteworthy guest stars were Christopher Lee and a very hot looking Joan Collins.  It was supposedly one of the most expensively produced series of the time though by todays standards you'd hardly know it, shows how far movie production has advanced.  The series was much like Star Trek where every week there would be a new guest star or stars and a new dilemma to overcome.  It only lasted two seasons but was a good watch back then, I even had a toy eagle space ship their version of a do everything utility space vehicle for the base.

On it's own merit it was also quite a unique series. It was never locked down into just one pattern so it never got sterile. There are episodes for every mood and mindset. One can enjoy the serious episodes or the just plain fun escapism. The setting of 1999 only adds to the fun and the out of control moon idea was certainly original. Many episodes allow the viewer to come to one's own conclusions and there's little clear continuity after the first episode which also allows creativity on the part of the veiwer. It's a very expansive and wonderous universe that's explored in different ways. The diversity of styles and ideas are it's greatest strength.
