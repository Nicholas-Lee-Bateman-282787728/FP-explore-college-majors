7851731,5,6303543820,"Olivier's Chichester Festival production of Uncle Vanya received outstanding reviews at the time.  Harold Hobson of the (London) Sunday Times described it as ""the admitted master achievement in British twentieth-century theatre"" while the New Yorker called it ""probably the best 'Vanya' in English we shall ever see"".  The black-and-white film made of the production captures much of its quality.  The cast featured a number of the big names of British theatre at the time: Oliver himself as Dr. Astrov, Michael Redgrave as Vanya, and so on.  There is hardly a weak performance in here, although it is a mystery why Fay Compton, as Vanya's mother, speaks -- alone of the characters -- in a clumsily fake Russian accent.  Aside from fine performances by Olivier and Redgrave, the two female leads also make their characters convincing.  Olivier's wife Joan Plowright makes us feel for Sonya, and Rosemary Harris makes Elena a more three-dimensional character than the rich bitch ice-maiden of some more recent productions.  Image quality may not be up to the best modern standards, but watch it anyway -- for the acting.",1314144000,8,1119,5.115384615384615

This was a recent addition to a college library collection. Other than describe this important dramaturgy of Russian literature, this Reviewer suffered through the BHE DVD only to list this dismal review on Amazon.

The print and screenplay is so terrible that Chekhov and Stanislavsky would turn over in their graves about British theater archives! But there are not very many alternative choices to watch the play on DVD. Baah, humbug; much better to watch Chekhov's ""Three Sisters,"" 1970), directed by L Olivier and Amer Film Theatre on a Kino DVD or the BBC Collection (08) of Chekhov plays staring Judi Dench (Oscar Supporting, Shakespeare in Love (98)) and Anthony Hopkins (Oscar Silence Lambs (91)).

Virtually unwatchable; definitely not enjoyable. This DVD is a faded B&W print, blurry, jumpy playback, double print, raster sync lines right through the faces, bright flashes, variable sound levels; but actor enunciation is good. Original production of the play was probably quite good, but this DVD reprint is a terrible value, suitable for archival purposes only. No chapter breaks or special DVD features such as a new commentary by a director or actors. The DVD is actually only 106 min, compared to the 120min claimed.

""Uncle Vanya (1899)"" is the second of Chekhov's four classic plays; others being the ""Seagull (1896), Three Sisters (1900) and his last ""The Cherry Orchard (1904), just before dying of tuberculosis. The era is just before the Russian Revolution with Lenin and Stalin. Many libraries have ""Uncle Vanya"" as a printed play translated into English, there are many different translators, Garnett was one of the first.

Uncle Vanya is a comic-tragedy which is typical of Russian literature. The details of this play is an important contribution to the art of dramaturgy, study of adapting stories into plays for stage and screen. Uncle Vanya loves his father's trophy 2nd wife, Helena. Vanya laments that he allowed Helena marry his father, when he still honored his father, instead of marrying her himself. Meanwhile plain-Jane, Sonya, is secretly in love with the Doc, Astroff. The two women in love converse.

In Act III, the love turns into a love triangle.

In Act IV (01:23), nobody ends up happy. The movie really starts tearing and miscuing at (1:43 to end 1:46) which may be due to this DVD production sample and / or a Sony SLV-D380P combo DVD-VHS player that has had DVD playback issues of other publishers.
