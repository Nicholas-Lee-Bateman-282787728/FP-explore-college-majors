3892931,5,B002B8BU7Q,"Gerald Weber's DVD from his seminar tours is an arsenal of great wealth for guitar tube amp builders. He can take both builders and repair techs from the ground up to details on designing your custom guitar tube amp. His method of teaching has enhanced my knowledge of tube amps from novice to advanced. I have repaired all my defunked amps, converted mediocre sounding amps to powerhouses and designed custom units that will blow your socks off. If you want to excel in understanding every aspect of what is involved with creating a sound you cannot do without, buy Gerald's books and DVDs. -Rusty Bones",1351036800,3,604,4.761904761904762
3892932,5,B002B8BU7Q,"I have made quite a few nice sounding amps in the past 3 years on my soldering and fabrication skills alone. I understand the basics, but have been unable to leap the gaping chasm between basic knowledge and competency in troubleshooting and design. The main reason is that I do not think well in math; and almost all the books I have tried are written for people who think well in math. And although I don't think they mean to, their writing is aimed at right brainers. Most of the forums I have been active in are the same way. They get to a certain point, and then their ""inner mathematician"" takes over and I am LOST, but quick! If this describes you, then get this video. Gerald Weber gets the fact that not everybody can make instant leaps into math and he is really good at setting you up and easing you into it. After one viewing, some of the stuff my math brothers have been throwing at me began to make sense. And don't listen to the Gerald Weber detractors. Most of them are right brainers. I'm sure he's not right about everything, but I'm saying he gets you to a point where you can begin to understand the math and subsequently, most of the literature out there on amps. Invaluable, in my opinion.",1329436800,5,1211,4.3628318584070795
3892933,5,B002B8BU7Q,"Very well done and thorough.  I have a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and was very impressed with how he explained the electrical concepts clearly without ever getting bogged down with RLC calculations of any kind.  He touches on a lot of history and takes you from a very basic amplifier design and explains how the design works and what it's strengths and weaknesses are.  He then takes you to the next historical 'version' of an amps design and explains how they 'tweaked' the previous version to improve weaknesses of the old version and how that in turn sometimes created other 'problems', etc, etc.  Pretty quickly he's up to talking about how the legendary Fender Twin Reverb, Bassman, and the british products like Vox and Marshall work and what makes each have their own musical 'flavor'.  Even if you don't plan to build or repair your amp I strongly recommend this DVD.  I wouldn't try to watch the whole thing in one sitting.. he tries to keep it 'lively' but hey, we're talking electrical circuit designs and you're going to get bored and 'saturated' with info if you don't take a break every 30-40 minutes.  If you've always wanted to know more about the guts of the magical old tube amps, this is a great primer!!",1295222400,16,1241,4.717592592592593
3892934,4,B002B8BU7Q,"I bought two of Gerald Weber's videos, and 4 books. Gerald isn't pretty to look at in the videos, but the books and videos are very helpful, though a lot of information is re-hashed from guitar magazine columns he wrote. Still, I learn something each time I watch or read them. Recommended for technically-minded folks, not for those with serious electronics/tube amp background or training.",1289174400,2,391,5.030769230769231

3892936,5,B002B8BU7Q,"He has a real knack for explaining 'complicated' electronic amplifiers in terms anyone can understand.  Won't make an electrical engineer out of you, but doesn't have to.  Great for understanding amps.",1418860800,,201,5.451612903225806
3892937,5,B002B8BU7Q,"Excellent intro for the neophyte, but a little light on nitty gritty details for experienced electronics techs (who just lack the valve theory and experience). That aside, I highly recommend it.",1412467200,,194,5.290322580645161
3892938,5,B002B8BU7Q,"When i studied electronics for servicing home use products, my teacher gave us a quick history on vacuum tubes . This DVD is very informative . Highly recommended.",1410998400,,163,4.857142857142857
3892939,5,B002B8BU7Q,In the interest of full disclosure have an associates degree in electronics.  So none of the information was over my head.  I'm not sure how well I would have followed along had I no previous experience in electronics.  But I really enjoyed the video.  I will refer back to it often when I finally get some time to work on my gear and friends' gear.  Very informative. Good analogies that help the viewer understand signal path.,1401926400,3,428,4.578947368421052
3892940,5,B002B8BU7Q,"Understandable,  Informative,  Watchable,  Listenable,  No technical yawns,  This man knows his stuff, Genius.  You need this dvd.  Buy it now.",1379980800,,143,5.85
3892941,5,B002B8BU7Q,Or at least I can say I finally understand how electricity can make something louder. I've been playing amplified music for decades and there have always been several missing links in my mind about how the sound gets to the speakers. Gerald Weber somehow puts it across. I bought this because I am starting to build a JTM 45 Marshall type amp from a kit; I want to understand why tis resistor goes here and that capacitor goes there. This DVD is a very good start.,1376870400,2,464,4.406976744186046
3892942,5,B002B8BU7Q,"step by step circuit analysis, great for beginners or advanced techs.  although they should have had better A/C at the conference room for Gerald cause he is sweating profusely.",1371772800,,177,5.103448275862069
3892943,5,B002B8BU7Q,"This goes from zero to I get it, on one disk. It does not assume that you know much about tube at all, but even if you do you will likely learn a few tricks. understanding parasitic oscillation and stray capacitance is well covered and vital to a successful build  and the old masters did not always get this right at all. Much gold to mine in this one.",1366329600,,353,4.115942028985507
3892944,5,B002B8BU7Q,"This video is like a guided tour down the back streets of Salzburg.  Mr. Weber walks you down the circuits of several different amps, like the 5E3 Deluxe and 5F6-A Bassman.  He points out landmarks along the way and explains some of the unique attributes in the amp's design.  I have built dozens of amps, and still find a tour a lot of fun.",1363737600,4,341,4.296875
3892945,5,B002B8BU7Q,"I own, all his products to date....I agree with everyone here that you have to take the DVDE's a little at a time....I like his books...however I'm not really a fan of the content set up.....they jump around...but overall....they are awesome...but I do believe you have to have some training or studies to really deceifer his books...I have a Degree in Electrical Engineering from Notheastern U. in Boston and I have to reread some chapters a couple times....he's a genius!!",1362700800,2,474,4.9375
8360804,2,B002B8BU7Q,"> Mr. Weber rambles constantly down every possible tangent and as a result often never actually gets around to explaining his basic point.
> Extremely disorganized mess.
Agreed. He obviously knows his stuff but not well organized and uses a ton of jargon. Sorry Mr. Webber.",1475798400,2,273,4.956521739130435
8360805,5,B002B8BU7Q,"This is a fabulous DVD for anyone with a mild to wild interest in Tube Guitar Amplifiers. Gerald has the ability to explain the workings and foibles of these gizmos without getting bogged down in all the math involved. Yes, there is a bit of elementary math that a 3rd grader could understand, but it is far from confusing and enhances the ability to understand the finer points of any electronic item. Gerald's video may seem a bit difficult to follow from time to time, but not to worry; watch it several times and things will begin to fall into place. I would highly recommend this to folks like me who are very interested in this stuff, but have a hard time following where all the electrons are going and just what they are doing at any given moment. As an aircraft mechanic, I find the circuits in amplifiers to be a bit confusing since AC and DC are doing different things at the same time in the same wires! But Gerald explains this sort of thing in a way no other individual I've run across has been able to do. The beauty of this format is not just that you can watch it as many times as you like, (which I have done and find very helpful,) but you get to watch as he draws out part of a circuit and explains what each bit is as he goes. Does he cover everything? Heck no! That would take 100 DVD's. But he does give you enough to get started in a firm understanding, and leaves you in a place where you want to know even more. I suggest purchasing some of his books, as they follow in his simple style of explaining things so the average individual can understand even a fairly complex circuit. Trust me, you WILL find yourself understanding this stuff if you have a desire to do so. It may not be on the first viewing of this DVD, but give yourself some time and watch it more than once. Then when you feel comfortable, you can go back and watch his circuit analyses over a few times and you will be surprised at how much better you will get what going on inside these things. It's fascinating and fun. Worth the price of admission.",1462838400,,2044,4.25706940874036

8360808,5,B002B8BU7Q,Excellent book.  Helped me fix my Fender amp that was blowing fuses.  So the book paid for itself many times over.  Mr. Weber certainly knows his stuff!,1448150400,,152,4.555555555555555
8360809,5,B002B8BU7Q,Awesome dvd. Learned alot about tube amps,1443139200,,41,5.0
8360810,5,B002B8BU7Q,I am getting back into electronics especially in the area of tubes. I found this video to be a very good refresher. I also purchased a couple of Gerald Weber's books. Very clear in his explanations - a very worthwhile investment in the area of reference.,1441411200,,254,4.543478260869565

8360812,4,B002B8BU7Q,"I studied electronics in high school but haven't done much with it for (mumble) years and was looking for a refresher.  It helps if you already have a basic understanding of electricity and electronics but Gerald Weber walks you through the details step by step.  This isn't really a ""how to repair and mod tube amps"" video; this is a ""how tube amps work"" video.  After going through the material you will be able to make sense of a schematic and recognize the sections of an amp in front of you.  The content of this video is good background knowledge before diving into videos,books, and articles on servicing, restoring, and hot rodding tube guitar amps.  For example, I see many recommendations for replacing filter caps but none of them explain why this may be useful or how different values affect sound and performance.  In this video Gerald Weber does both.  Nothing in this video will be news to experienced techs but if you're a little rusty or new to the inside of tube amps this is an excellent place to start.",1426032000,,1022,4.613259668508287
8360813,5,B002B8BU7Q,"If you're interested in really UNDERSTANDING how a tube amplifier FUNCTIONS and not just soldering parts together this is a great resource to add to your reference library.  There are no physical guitar amplifiers in this video - it's all theory and schematics and breaks things down to a very fundamental level and builds from there.  I'm looking to build my foundation of understanding and this is helping a lot.  I plan to buy other Gerald Weber videos, etc in the future.",1422748800,,475,4.7682926829268295
