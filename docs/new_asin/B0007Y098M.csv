2251280,5,B0007Y098M,"The show so good I had to find a way to coerce my DVD player to play multiple regions in order to get Season 2 from Amazon.co.uk so I could watch the insanity unfold!

Absolutely not to be missed, and look for the movie, ""LOG: Apocalypse"" coming soon.  I can only imagine the release of the movie has something to do with them finally getting around to putting out region 1 discs of the second and third seasons.",1116892800,3,412,4.269230769230769
2251281,5,B0007Y098M,"Wicked, twisted fun from very talented actors. Dark British humor at its best! This guys bring you very memorable characters. It's like a bad wreck--you have to look, and keep watching!",1390780800,,185,5.0
2251282,4,B0007Y098M,"It helps to be familiar with the characters from season one, so you might want to watch that first, just so you are not completely lost, but season two does have its own story arc to follow. Some of the characters from season one do carry over, but a whole new cast of bizarre characters shows up, most memorably Papa Lazarou, one of the scariest, funniest creations in the history of British comedy. This episode, ""Destination Royston Vasey"", is your introduction to this notorious monster. If you like conventional American sitcom humor, this series ain't for you. It's like David Lynch tried his hand at Pythonesque humor. It's twisted, it's weird, and it's all painfully hilarious. Only three actors play most of the major characters, so have fun figuring out who plays who!",1346544000,,778,4.857142857142857
2251283,2,B0007Y098M,"We thoroughly enjoyed the first season of League of Gentlemen, but the second series (or season) fell short.  The same characters and same locations were used, but the writing wasn't as clever as in the first season.  We don't know if we'll purchase the third season at this point.",1249948800,,281,4.714285714285714
2251284,4,B0007Y098M,"As dark and disturbing as was the first season, The League never disappoints.  Not quite as funny as was the first season (perhaps I was just used to the type of humor) still MORE than amusing in most places, Season Two (and season three as well) carried on the humorously horriffic story of Royston Vasey well.  Any BBC fan should own this.  Never would it make it on any network here on THIS side of the pond, the Brits seem to have a very different skew on all things funny, ala Monty Python.  I love the stuff.  Next purchases?  ""Coupling"".",1178496000,,544,4.39
2251285,5,B0007Y098M,The most brilliant TV series created.  Begin with series 1 if you like dark British humor!  This is truly the best TV series I have ever seen.,1151539200,,142,4.222222222222222
2251286,3,B0007Y098M,"I loved the first season.  Just loved it!  Now that I finally got my hands on the second and third series it's more clear to me why I loved the first season so much.  The first season was extraordinary British humor that we Americans don't get enough of.  It was over the top, razor sharp wit with just enough real-world infused into it to make us all see ourselves in it and laugh that much harder.  The second series is a rather different approach and departure with more blood and gore than anything else.  It's not bad it's just not that good...if you know what I mean.  The skits become so out-there that they lose a good portion of their punch.  The ""local"" story goes to a place that is so silly you just start shaking your head rather than laughing.  I am personally still morning the death of this brillant humor....",1141776000,,825,4.375
2251287,1,B0007Y098M,"I usually like British comedies, but this one I found to be a big disappointment. Don't buy unless you've already seen an episode.",1130889600,,130,4.695652173913044
2251288,5,B0007Y098M,"After a flabbergasting first season, the League of Gentlemen pick up their bizarre world of Royston-Vasey exactly where they left off, but infuse it with nitroglycerin with the arrival of a circus and its Al Jolson made up figure of Papa Lazarou.  The scene where he kidnaps another wife (apparently he calls all of them Dave) and puts her in a lions cage with the rest of his collection, hosing them down ... well, it almost drove me insane ... with laughter.  I felt like my reality had been changed.

The League's brand of humor mixed with horror might not be for everyone, but I loved it.  If you like Monty Python's The Meaning of Life's brand of disgusting satire, the League of Gentlemen is the next logical step.",1119830400,4,720,4.558139534883721
2251289,5,B0007Y098M,"The gents have done it again! They have introduced stranger new characters as well as bringing back some of the oldie but goodies. I found this series to be just as entertaining as the first. The thing I find with the League of Gents is that either you really love them or you don't. If you like twisted black humor; humor where you feel slightly guity for laughting so hard at, then this show is for you. If this isn't your type of humor you can watch reruns of Friends and Seinfeld.",1119225600,4,484,4.271739130434782
2251290,4,B0007Y098M,"The second series of THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN delves more deeply into the twisted world of Royston Vasey, whose inhabitants seem to be more eerily-eccentric as the episodes continue.

The series opens as Ben escapes the clutches of Edward and Tubbs, only to become a virtual prisoner in the home of Harvey and Val.  The circus of Papa Lazarou rolls into town, though the citizens of Royston Vasey look more outlandish than the circus performers!

Pauline, the fallen restart officer, plots her revenge while working at the Burger Me Restaurant with Mickey as her 'capable' assistant.  Also introduced in this series is German tour guide Herr Lipp, a disgusting old lech with a penchant for teenage boys.

As the entire town falls victim to a mysterious nose-bleeding virus, the stories of these and many more characters play out to frighteningly-comic effect.

Includes all 6 episodes of Series 2 (""Destination Royston Vasey"", ""Lust for Royston Vasey"", ""A Plague on Royston Vasey"", ""Death in Royston Vasey"", ""Anarchy in Royston Vasey"" and ""Royston Vasey and the Monster from Hell"").",1118707200,3,1081,5.113636363636363
8053896,5,B0007Y098M,I love this series!  I bought this because it was removed from Netflix.  I wish there were more episodes on the disc. The very humorous opening screen/menu is easy to navigate.  Very funny indeed.,1490832000,,196,4.705882352941177
8053897,5,B0007Y098M,"OMG: I thought Series 1 was nuts...in other words, humor as only the British seem to be able to devise. I was intrigued, shocked, amused, aghast, perplexed, and so sad it did not go on for hours more. To say these folks are brilliant would be simple. They are, quite frankly, the natural descendants of Monty Python and I loved  every depraved, sick, twisted, psychotic story line. The genetic pool has degraded to a quarry full of toads: slimy, primordial circus-freaks and incestuous ne'er-do-wells that kept me glued to the  t.v. for hours and hoping it would never end. I'm off to Series 3! But first, I will probably watch Series 2 at least 10 or 20 more times, just to be certain I haven't missed a single scene.",1438041600,,718,4.558139534883721

8053899,4,B0007Y098M,You have to be ready for some  pretty dark humor.  This is some of the oddest comedy you're likely to encounter.  And it's addictive.,1427155200,,133,4.458333333333333
