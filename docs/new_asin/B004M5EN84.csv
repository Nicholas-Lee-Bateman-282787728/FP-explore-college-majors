8435507,5,B004M5EN84,Charlie Chaplin's (1952) final American made film was LIMELIGHT which introduced Claire Bloom and in which Chaplin makes his only appearance with the great Buster Keaton. As of 2014 it has not been released on Blu-ray in the United States so I was very excited to find this Import Edition that plays on Region One players. The transfer is excellent and the film looks far better than it ever has before. The Blu-ray upgrade is worth while. The only Extra is the Chaplin short film SUNNY SIDE and a very short photo collection. High Recommended if your are a fan of LIMELIGHT.,1392422400,,575,4.647058823529412
