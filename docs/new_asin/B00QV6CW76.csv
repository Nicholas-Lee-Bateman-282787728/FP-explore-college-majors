8693103,5,B00QV6CW76,"Have loved this series, and Season 3 was no exception.  Was a bit sad.  The acting and story lines are fresh and engaging.  Sure hope there's a season 4.",1429574400,,153,4.206896551724138
8693104,5,B00QV6CW76,"Tough season for all of the main characters with their different storylines, but superb acting by all. It was more drama than comedy in this season. I hope that next season they will return with more comedy than drama like in the first season. It will be interesting see where all the characters go from here.",1428019200,,309,4.535714285714286
8693105,4,B00QV6CW76,"The reviewers on Amazon.co.uk have often been harsh with season three of this series, arguing, in some cases, that the writer (the excellent Sally Wainwright) has been pushing too hard and too far.  The level of angst in the series has taken us to the edge and some of the charm of the first two seasons has been lost.  There is something to this, though the performances remain strong as the plots intensify.

Caroline marries a very pregnant Kate; Gillian considers marrying Robbie even as she beds multiple other individuals.  A serious and troubling moment from Alans past is revealed and results in the introduction of a new character who feverishly stirs the family pot.  A key character dies (wholly unexpectedly) and lives must be rearranged.

I would put it like this: LTIH is a dramedy and in season three we are long on drama and shorter on comedy.  The basic story (from the get-go) is that all families are essentially wacky, but particularly this one.  Familial wackiness can result in resonant comedy or it can result in middle class tragedy.  (Ha, thats just like our family or My Lord, our family is just like that.)  The job of a sophisticated writer like Sally Wainwright is to maintain a very subtle balanceto evoke smiles at our feckless humanity without taking us too far into the dark.  Some will think that season three walks the dark line a little too closely.

There are two discs, six 55-minute episodes.  American audiences can see this and other British programming earlier (and often less expensively) by acquiring an all-regions dvd player.  I recommend the models by Pioneer.",1425686400,19,1607,4.8388278388278385
