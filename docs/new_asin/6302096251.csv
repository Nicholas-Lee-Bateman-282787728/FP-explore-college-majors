427382,4,6302096251,"The film takes its name from the rain that fell immediately after the atomic explosion at Hiroshima in August, 1945, at the end of WWII, that was black ""like ink"". It looks at the effects of the atomic bomb.

The movie covers the explosion, and we are initially shown a graphic recreation of what happened, with many specific details (such as the shadow left on the clock) that add to the realism.

As Yasuko and her Uncle and Aunt make their way acrosss the centre of town to find refuge in the Uncle's factory we are exposed to rampant scenes of the bomb victims (who look like they're zombies out of old b-movies) walking the streets.

The main of the movie deals with the effects of radiation sickness on the community where our family live. This includes the social effects. Yasuko, a young woman, is the victim of ""false rumours"" about her health and this causes issues over her ultimate goal, to find a good husband.

Yasuko, eventually finds her partner in the towns token 'crazy' man who also has war related 'issues', only with the sound of engines that remind him of the sound of American tanks. The two find solice with each other and although it is like Yasuko is settling for crazy man for want of someone better she does in fact fall in love with him for no other reason than his beauty of spirit.

Romance, however takes second place to the 'left-wing' view of the director and his ultimate message that ""an unjust peace is better than war"", told to us by the extremely admirable character in the Uncle, Shizuma.",1108425600,7,1528,4.541818181818182
427383,3,6302096251,"But I am outraged to the comments Mariposa and Lopez left behind. First of all, Mariposa, the Japanese did NOT start the Second World War. The day that America was involved with World War II is not the day the war began. The World War began in 1939 when Germany and an Anglo-French coalition conflicted which eventually widened to the rest of Europe and resulted in the genocide of Jews, Catholics, homosexuals, Gypsies, the mentally retarded, the physically handicapped, and Jehovah's Witnesses. Secondly, how can you say that dropping an atomic bomb on innocent civilians is right and our ""finest moment"" and still be a ""real patriot""? To say such a thing shows not your love for America, but your fascist and generalizing opinions on a certain race. And if you think that the Japanese are evil and should die because of their act of terrorism upon Pearl Harbor, do you agree that all Muslims should die for 9/11? Do you think that all British people should die because King George III was unfair to the American colonists?
I agree that the Japanese have done some terrible things such as the Rape of Nanking and the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but hasn't America done terrible things as well? What nation or group of people has not committed malicious acts within their history? What about slavery and lynching and creating racist laws and concentration camps and the Philippines War and police violently beating peaceful protestors? You can't say that every single Japanese person deserved the atomic bomb. Japan's citizens do not neccessarily represent their leader's actions as America's citizens do not neccessarily represent their President's decisions. Please do tell me if you can't find an action or decision one of our presidents have done/made that you weren't involved with or maybe even innocent of and didn't agree with it.
But if they did deserve the atomic bomb then what do we deserve? For all the malicious acts and crimes against others America has committed, we deserve the same pain that we gave the Japanese and any other country we have hurt. And please do not say, ""This person is only saying this because this person's Japanese."" That is outright unfair and cruel. I wish people could at least try to understand the other side of an issue.

And a comment to ""Mariposa, et al, is a MORON!; June 27, 2004; Reviewer: A viewer"" I agree with your comment up to ""Mariposa and other Floridian inbreds..."" You just like Mariposa and Lopez are generalizing people. Not to mention you are bringing in a topic that doesn't even relate to Black Rain. And Bush's war is -not- about oil. I'm not saying I'm for the war, but you are mistaken.

And to T. Tan ""the apprentice"", are you saying that all Latin Americans are ""bimbos""? And how do you know that Mariposa and Lopez haven't read the book or seen the movie? They said nothing of the sort or even implied it.

Note: I gave three stars because I wanted to be neutral since I didn't see the movie or read the book. Maybe sometime I will and if my opinion changes I'll write here again if possible.",1099353600,11,3060,4.71588785046729
427384,5,6302096251,"This goes to ""Margo Lopez"" and ""Jenni Garcia Mariposa"", who are both probably the same person trying to pose as two Latin-American bimbos from different locales. Neither one (if they are really two) have actually seen the film, and are judging a book by its cover.  ""Mariposa"" voiced the same tune for the book ""Black Rain (Japan's Modern Writers S.)"" by Masuji Ibuse (click on ""her"" name for more info).  In total, that's 3 ""reviews"" from two usernames. It's as if that's all they are here for. Neither one wrote anything else since.

The film NEVER blamed the Americans even though they dropped the atomic bomb.  In fact, the Japanese implied self-blame for what had happened - their government perpetrated the war, and the civilians suffered because of it.  But you wouldn't know that unless you have seen the film.

The characters could have been anyone of us: the uncle who can't work as hard as he used to because he is ill, the niece who has trouble finding a suitable partner because of exaggerated rumors, the aunt tries to hold her family together, the war veteran whose experiences of war keeps haunting him and drive him crazy, and the superfical manner in which the people approach a national tragedy.  You can find a lot of similar situations in your own country's history, unless you're igonorant of it.

Imamura's masterpiece deserves a perfect 10 from me.  The fact that it can get a coward to pose as two ""chicks"" is a testament to the power of the film (subject matter).  That and ""any publicity is good publicity"".",1097971200,19,1534,4.711610486891386

The director (and before that the Author) seem to be trying to rewrite history by playing on the sympathy of the viewers which is just wrong given the facts of the event.

427387,5,6302096251,"Immamura's tour de force about a girl and her blood relatives' attempt to go on with life after surviving the August '45 bombing. While the film has been described as ""restrained"", it is also possible to receive  the film as an incredibly eruptive effort: one that portrays its characters  *always* on the verge of breaking down -- both physically and mentally --  from the wholly destructive and lingering effects of the bombs. While the  ending escalates to full-blown helplessness (by using a self-reflexive  comment about the limits of black and white film), the acting is an  absolute success, particularly by the girl and the carver that loves her.",927331200,17,654,5.0092592592592595
427388,5,6302096251,"BLACK RAIN is the only movie of director Shohei Imamura that can be found in the DVD standard. It's a pity since this director is still one of the most interesting japanese directors even if he's now 72 years old. Winner  of two Cannes Palmes d'Or ith THE EEL and THE BALLAD OF NARAYAMA, he isn't  properly speaking a newcomer but his work deserves to be known by a wider  audience.
The black rain is the name Japanese people have given to the  rain that fell on Hiroshima right after the nuclear bombing of this island.  Black and deadly. The movie, shot in black and white, tells the story of a  couple of survivors and their struggle to stay alive and be part of the new  japanese society born after the emperor's surrender.
One could say that  BLACK RAIN's rythm is slow but I think it's a courageous choice of Shohei  Imamura in order that we feel the fear of these people waiting their whole  life for the first signs of the inevitable diseases provoked by  radioactivity. In between, they try to survive like Yasuko, the heroin,  whose search for a husband is pathetic.
Two scenes will stay in your  memory. Firstly, the description of Hiroshima in comparison of which those  horror movies Hollywood produces by the dozen seem, for the least,  ridiculous. And this scene when Yasuko, filled with hope, waits for a  shining rainbow, symbolizing life. You wait with her, with all your heart,  until you remember that this film is shot in black and white. Simply  magistral.
A scene access as sole extra-feature.

427509,4,6302096251,"This is a good movie.  However, an alternate ending is included, and it is much better, in my opinion, that the one chosen for distribution.  Compared to the alternate ending, the movie as distributed now seems truncated to me.  The reason may be because the alternate ending extend the movie and makes it seem more philosophical or complete, more about survival than being victims.  The movie also puts forth the question -- Why would the Americans do this to us? -- without filling in any history, as if dropping the atomic bomb/s was a random act of violence.",1370390400,,562,4.704081632653061
427510,5,6302096251,"This film has been described by many as a masterpiece and indeed it is.  The film is shot in black and white and difficult subjects are delicately handled.  It is a slow almost poetic movie in the way that sensitive Japanese films can be.  But it is riveting nonetheless. I originally saw the movie in New Zealand, in the very early '90s not long after it came out. It was not shown widely in the US.  I decided to buy this copy so I could see it again, as I have never forgotten the experience of watching it,  and I wanted to show it to friends.

This is not easy viewing as it deals with the US nuclear bombing of Hiroshima.  Although the film is decades old the theme and subject matter is still very important.  Horrific as it was, the actual bombing and its aftermath take up only a few minutes at the beginning.  The rest of the film focuses on ordinary people and how they were affected by the bomb and the radiation; how their lives years later were affected.

We can read statistics about how many got radiation poisoning etc, but numbers just gloss over the human anxieties and suffering.  You may wonder why you might want to watch such a film.  For one, it is good to know and remind oneself of the real suffering that war and bombs, particularly nuclear bombs inflict on people.  Perhaps in doing so citizens and governments would be less likely to willy nily talk about dropping such a devastating weapon.  The film raises many questions.  Even if a war needs to be ended as soon as possible and even if the ""enemy"" has started the war, is a nuclear bomb the answer.  Other ways, more humane and moral must be found. As one character in the film says:  An unjust peace is better than a war of justice.",1367712000,4,1716,4.345911949685535

Brilliant! Tarkovsky's Stalker, and this. And this is more humane, and therefore more Christian, yes, than Tarkovsky. Brilliant! Just watch the movie, and then that unreleased ending.

427512,5,6302096251,"""Black Rain"" is a beautiful piece of art, but it's very hard to watch. I could only get through the first hour by viewing it in 15-minute chunks. That's how disturbing this film is; it holds nothing back in its depiction of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. And really, the second hour doesn't get that much easier to take. After the immediate horrors of the bombing are over, the rest of the film shows civilians gradually sickening and dying of radiation sickness.

But ""Black Rain"" is more than just horrifying. Shohei Imamura's direction is oddly (in this context) lovely and powerful, and the entire cast is rock-solid. So this is not exclusively a message movie; it's also an excellent movie in other respects.

Of course, this movie will stir up powerful feelings and associations for most viewers. My conservative friends tend to think that the atomic bombing of Hiroshima was justified, while liberals often consider it an American war crime. My politics are middle-of-the-road. I understand why America decided to use the bomb - why it made tactical and even moral sense to us - but I'm also horrified at the results. All I can say is, I'm not the kind of person who would ever want to make life-and-death decisions; nor do I feel qualified to judge those who do, especially in this context.

The important thing, really, is that this film is anti-war in the best way; it depicts the terrible suffering of civilians, and makes a strong argument against aggression by any country. The characters who are sickened by radiation are shown to resent both America, and their own government (one of them wonders why the bomb wasn't dropped on the leadership in Tokyo instead). So you can feel free to ignore the inevitable ignorant comments on this site, to the effect that this movie is anti-American propaganda. It's anti-war propaganda, which suits me just fine. And if you want to see a Japanese movie that includes more direct self-criticism of the country's role in the war, there's always ""The Human Condition,"" which is unflinching in its depiction of wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese army.

Well, enough of that defensive stuff. My real point is that this is a disturbing and superb movie - and if you can handle being challenged and disgusted and angered all at the same time, you will probably find it worthwhile. The DVD itself, meanwhile, is very good; it contains an alternate ending (which diminishes the film's power), interviews with cast and crew, and plenty of historical background on the bombing of Hiroshima. The subtitles are fine, though their default coloring (yellow and green!) is odd; you may want to choose the alternate option for white subtitles. Overall, it's a good DVD product, and I'm glad that this film and other 1980s Japanese movies - which are typically passed over by the Criterion Collection - are getting fairly high-quality releases.",1317600000,2,2891,4.9059304703476485
427513,5,6302096251,"WOW. this one had me glued to my seat for its' entirety. the horror of war and the impact it has on civilians is demonstrated vividly in this movie. some may say the comparison is unfair but, the victims of the 9/11 attack will understand the emotions experienced by the victims of Hiroshima. the horror of war always has been and always will be an appalling waste of human lives.",1315440000,,380,4.442857142857143
427514,5,6302096251,This film definitely informs you that not all Japs are Kamakazees. It's a great film about the Hiroshima atomic bomb from a civilian's point of view. The film is called Black Rain because the rain was black after the bombs. In depth the film postscripts the events after the tragedy. There are big issues about women becoming infertile due to radiation. There is also quite a bit of focus on a typical Japanese middle class family. Great film to watch.,1305158400,,452,4.6625

427516,5,6302096251,"On the morning of August 6, 1945, a young woman named Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka) catches a ride with a neighbor who is evacuating from Hiroshima in order to transport her family's formal clothes and sentimental possessions to a friend's home for safekeeping on a nearby island in Furu. At 8:15, during a tea ceremony, Yasuko and her hosts witness a sudden, blinding flash of light and hurry outside to observe the surreal sight of an ominous mushroom cloud rising from the island. Concerned over the plight of her supportive and compassionate guardians, uncle Shigeko (Etsuko Ichihara) and aunt Shigamatsu (Kazuo Kitamura), Yasuko boards a boat returning to Hiroshima and, along the way, encounters the radioactive fallout from the atomic bomb in the curious form of black rain that discolors her clothing and face. Arriving home, she unsuccessfully attempts to wash the indelible stains from her clothing (which Shigeko innocently surmises must have been caused by the explosion of an oil vessel), but is soon scuttled away by her guardians in order to escape the rampant chaos and continued danger of falling debris and uncontrolled fires raging through the center of town. Yasuko and her family eventually find refuge in Shigeko's place of employment - a factory on the outskirts of the island. A few years later, as the family struggles to rebuild their life amidst the ruins of Hiroshima in the rural village of Takafuta, Shigeko and Shigamatsu attempt to find a suitable husband for Yasuko in the grim realization that they have begun to exhibit initial symptoms of radiation poisoning. However, despite reaching marrying age and receiving a clean bill of health from the neighborhood doctor, Yasuko's marital prospects prove bleak, marred by the experience of the atomic bomb that invariably drives suitors away in fear of the unknown long-term effects of the island's exposure.

Based on the serialized novel by Masuji Ibuse, Black Rain is a somber, visually distilled, and deeply affecting portrait of the human toll and uncalculated tragedy of nuclear holocaust. In contrast to Shohei Imamura's characteristically unrefined, primitivistic, and subversively bawdy cinema, the film is shot in high contrast black and white, creating a spare and tonally muted chronicle of dignity, survival, community, and human resilience. Through recurring literal and figurative images of regression, Imamura conveys a dual meaning, not only in the community's noble attempt to rebuild Hiroshima and return to a semblance of normal life after the annihilating bombing but also in their collective gradual and systematic erasure from Japanese society through long-term effects of radiation sickness, infertility, cultural (and geographic) isolation, and social stigmatization: Yasuko's inability to wash the stains from the black rain that tainted her clothing; her evening chore of resetting the clock; her multiple, unrealized marriage proposals; her grandmother's senility. The theme of futile cyclicality and repetition is further illustrated in the threatened use of nuclear weapons during the Korean War, an irresponsible comment that causes a dispirited and embittered Shigeko to remark, ""Unjust peace is better than a war of justice"". In a memorably sublime and surreal episode, Yasuko and Shigeko observe an oversized carp swimming upstream in the village pond. It is a haunting and transcendent reflection of the community's own metaphoric struggle as well - a poetic image of tenacity and determination against an inalterable current of recklessness, ignorance, and myopic vision.",1262736000,2,3581,5.440647482014389
427517,5,6302096251,"I've waited awhile to get this film on DVD -- the old VHS version just doesn't do it justice.  Take a deep breath, if you haven't seen it before.  A serious film that should be on everyone's ""to see"" list.",1258588800,3,205,4.1
427518,5,6302096251,"After the initial explosion of the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" over the city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, the skies turned black and rain began to fall.  This rain, black and muddy, was so welcome by the survivors of the blast that some people even opened their mouths to drink the previous water, completely unaware that a new kind of death was falling from the sky.  What the Japanese referred to as ""kuroi ame,"" black rain, we know now as nuclear fallout.

""Black Rain"" (Japanese title ""Kuroi Ame"") is an adaptation of the 1965 book of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/same-title/dp/087011364X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">same title</a>&nbsp;by Masuji Ibuse, following the lives of a small family who were affected by the radiation poisoning following the atomic blast.  One man, Shigematsu Shizuma (Kitamura Kazuo,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Japan-s-Longest-Day/dp/B000GDIBQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Japan's Longest Day</a>), was directly affected by the blast itself, known as ""pika"" in Japanese, and carries an unhealing wound on his cheek.  His wife Shigeko (Ichihara Etsuko,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samurai-Rebellion/dp/B000AQKUD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samurai Rebellion</a>) and niece Yasuko (Tanaka Yoshiko,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ringu-0/dp/B0009X765K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ringu 0</a>) were not in Hiroshima city during the blast itself, but were under the black rain when it began to fall.

Shizuma, Shigeko and Yasuko try to make a life for themselves in a small village where there are a few other Hiroshima survivors, known in Japanese as hibakusha, facing discrimination and health problems lasting long after the war is over.  Yasuko is still a young woman of twenty-five, and yet cannot find a husband as the cloud of Hiroshima and atomic disease hangs over her.  Here uncle Shizuma tries to clear her name, producing doctor's records attesting to her health, but the hibakusha are seen as tainted, and no family will agree to join themselves to the nuclear family.  One by one, the hibakusha in the village begin to become sick and die, and Yasuko wonders when the cold hand of radiation poisoning will finally come to claim her.

A story like this seems ready made for melodrama and tears, but under the guiding hand of master director Imamura Shohei (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vengeance-Is-Mine/dp/B000NOK0GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vengeance Is Mine</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ballad-of-Narayama/dp/B0015I2SNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ballad of Narayama</a>) we are presented with a much more personal family drama.  Shizuma knows he is living under a guaranteed death sentence, but strives to find a husband for the still-healthy Yasuko before he dies.  They go about their daily lives, making plans for the future such as stocking a local koi pond but always with the knowledge that the future is not theirs to have.

Probably my favorite scene in ""Black Rain"" is when Shizuma and a fellow hibakusha share a quiet moment drinking on the porch at night, wondering why exactly it was Hiroshima that was picked for the bomb, and not Tokyo.  They aren't shouting ""woe is me"" or expressing rage, merely curious as to why their homes were the target of the new weapon.  That kind of scene, which really shows Imamura's humanistic touch, raises the level of ""Black Rain"" to something more than a pity party.

The story flits between the present day villiage life, and flashback scenes to the bombing itself and the desperate escape Shizuma, Yasuko and Shigeko made through the burning streets of Hiroshima.  The flashback scenes show the horrors that have become associated with Hiroshima; the charred human beings with the melted flesh of their fingers hanging down like gloves,  the mercy of lack of pain with even the most hideous wounds due to nerves having been completely cauterized by the blast,  the constant cries of ""water,"" ""water"" by those whose bodies were instantly dehydrated by the heat of the blast.

I went to school in Hiroshima, and have been to the Peace Park many times, and seen the artifacts of the blast in person, the shadow figures burned on walls, the clocks stopped at the exact time of the blast,  the photographs of melted humans.  Imamura does an elegant job of presenting all of this horror without wallowing in it, and never leaving behind the humanity inherent in the dead and the survivors.

Animeigo clearly considers ""Black Rain"" an important movie, because they have gone all out on the production of this DVD.  Of course they did the usual excellent job with the subtitles, providing several options including straight subtitles, subtitles with ""pop-up"" cultural notes, and a unique non-subtitle option with only signs translated for those studying Japanese, in either white or yellow. They also commissioned something wonderful that has never been seen anywhere before this DVD.

Director Imamura originally intended ""Black Rain"" to have a color epilogue.  (Remember, this movie was filmed in 1983, so the use of black-and-white was entirely a stylistic choice as would be seen in later films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List/dp/B00012QM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List</a>).  Ultimately Imamura was not satisfied with the color epilogue, and the ending was re-shot in black-and-white.  For the first time, Animeigo commissioned an edit of the 19-minute color epilogue and included it on this DVD for the first time.  I agree with Imamura's choice not to include it in the finished film, but it is really nice to have as an extra feature.

Also included on this DVD under the title of ""Multimedia Vault,"" are several US-produced propaganda films about Japan and the atomic bomb, including ""Our Enemy: The Japanese,""  ""My Japan,"" ""A Tale of Two Cities: Hiroshima and Nagasaki,"" ""Atom Blast At Hiroshima"" and ""Truman Radio Address (6 August 1945).""  There are two video interviews produced for this DVD, one with actress Tanaka Yoshiko, who played Yasuko, and one with director Miike Takeshi (Ichi the Killer, Audition) who worked on ""Black Rain"" as an assistant director.",1257984000,13,6420,5.833155080213904
427589,5,6302096251,"When I first saw this film, I felt certain it must have been made in the 1950s. Realizing that Ichihara Etsuko couldn't have been that old in the 1950s had me confused, and I later found the film was shot in 1989. The director, Imamura Shohei, gave it the feel of an old film not only by shooting in black and white, but also by having the characters act in an old style. As a result the film draws the viewer in as if he were watching the story shortly after the war.

*Spoiler alert!*

Stop reading here if you don't want the plot revealed.

An ordinary day becomes a gruesome shock for young Yasuko as she makes her way through the city of Hiroshima on a hot August morning. A sudden flash and blast (pika-don) turn a daily routine into a confused nightmare. Commuters burn in street cars where they stand. Clocks stop. A boy is so scarred his own brother can't recognize him, nor can he remember his own name.

Yasuko's ordeal doesn't end even after she flees the flattened inferno of a city for the safety of the countryside. Yes, she apparently escaped without a scratch, but the fact radioactive black rain fell on her as she took a boat across the bay has prospective marriage prospects cautious. Could she also have the radiation sickness that is affecting so many others? Her uncle makes sure she gets a clean bill of health to show doubters she will make a good, healthy wife.

The most heart-stopping scene (don't worry, I won't ruin it by giving you the details) is when Yasuko discovers she does indeed have radiation sickness. Her chances for the good match her aunt and uncle envisioned disappear.

In the countryside of Fukuyama (east of Hiroshima City) reside others affected by the war. Among those with radiation sickness lives a former Imperial Army soldier tormented by memories of the harrowing missions he was ordered to undertake. Yasuko's compassion for him and her uncle's acceptance of her inability to marry well lead to the two war-damaged young people finding comfort in marriage together.

This is a micro view of the war and how it affected the film's subjects, so it is refreshingly free from political commentary. This is historical fiction, so enjoy the story.",1256774400,3,2196,4.658914728682171

I reveiwed the film again last night, and was surprised to find the film is out of print, and that the price listed is ridiculously high. If you can, wait until it is more reasonable. However, it is a remarkebly great cinematic masterpiece. The film was directed by Shohei Imamura, and stars Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka) as a young woman who must live with the consequneces of a changed life after the war: The setting is the city of Hiroshima. Yasuko was hit with the Black Rain, which fell on the survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, hence the title of the film. The film is based on the novel by Masuji Ibuse, who based the book on information he was able to gather from the survivors of the blast, and diaries of many others. This film is about how an entire family was affected by this bombing.

The film begins with the bombing of Hiroshima: A blinding light and sudden blast is seen and heard by the occupants of the city. The suvivors must somehow come to terms with the bombing, however, they are unaware of the effects the bomb will have on them later. The film is shot in black and white, and is very effective, if not more so if the film was shot in color. Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka) has been exposed to the 'Black Rain' [radioactive fallout], while looking for her family. There are some horrific scenes which Director Imamura shares with the viewers. Yasuko's life is now forever changed. Moreover, Yasuko's uncle, Shigematsu Shimuza (Kazuo Kitamura) and her aunt, Shigeko (Etsuko Ichihara) have been affected by the radiation. Yet, they all go about as if life must go on, trying to put the past behind them.

Further, everyone wants to go on with life as if the radiation and its effects are in the past. Yet, for Yasuko the past is always with her. When her aunt and uncle try to find her a suitable husband, the men who are eligible turn down marriage offers because they suspect that Yasuko has been contaminated, and that her health will be a problem. However, the only one that Yasuko feels comfortable with is a man Yuichi (Keisuke Ishida) who himself has been contaminated by the blast. The film is very moving and thought provoking. The film avoids any sensationalism of the events of August 6, 1945. Imamura instead focuses on those whose lives have been altered due to this tragic event in human history. This is not a political film, it is about the lives of those affected by this bombing, and how they cope with its aftermath. Highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]",1168819200,2,2542,4.584615384615384
427593,5,6302096251,"If you are a frequent viewer of foreign film, you may know that periodically, you need to view a film twice, especially with oriental films.  In this case... Japanese, old film, similar looking people, complex names, lack of clear close-ups, etc.

So, if you don't care to see it twice, pay attention, as it is difficult to simultaneously read subtitles, figure who is who by face, name or situation.

The bomb that hit Hiroshima in 1945 is vividly portrayed with horrifying images.  However, one scene shows a young boy with his face practically burned off and he begs that his brother recognize him.  This was farfetched as the boy seemed to be without any pain or discomfort.  But other images seemed more realistic.  Over the length of the film, we see the deteriorating health of those hit by the bomb and the black rain, the radiation fallout.

But with few complexities in storytelling, this plot is rather simple.  An aunt, and uncle and senile grandmother live with a niece and the goal is to get her married.  The problem lies with a rumor that plagues the niece.  Three potential suitors have reneged on the proposal because she is unhealthy because of the bomb.  The struggle is to prove that it was not because of a direct hit from the bomb, it was just radiation fallout as the three were merely crossing through the devastated city in search of relatives.

Based on a true story, this is an emotional film that records the journey to simply marry off a young woman who is rumored with an unhealthy certificate for marriage.

Yes, the bombing was an atrocious act and I don't want to go there, so focus on the journey by an aunt and uncle in their quest to get their niece married before they die, because they too, were victims of the radiation fallout.

427594,5,6302096251,"Ever since Theodor Adorno first raised questions about the possibility of making poetry after Auschwitz, art has been haunted by the possibility of its own failure, the possibility that one of its most remarkable features--its ability to shock the viewer into new ways of seeing--might be eclipsed by the great spectacles of mass death the extermination camps made possible.  How could there be poetry after Auschwitz?  To this question another could be added: Can there be cinema after Hiroshima?  Or is all cinema doomed to failure given the incursions the mushroom cloud has made on our consciousness?

Perhaps one answer to that question can be found in Bertolt Brecht's poem ""Motto"" which, while avoiding the question of whether art can, in the face of the technology of mass death, preserve its special ability to re-focus our attention, affirms simply the persistence of poetic testimony:

In the dark times
Will there also be singing?
Yes, there will be singing
About the dark times.

Like Brecht, Shohei Imamura's ""Black Rain"" refuses to remain silent in the face of the 20th century's great horrors, choosing instead the far riskier route of giving voice to them and of painstakingly documenting the devastating effects radiation has on a community while never once imagining that this message, if received, will be heard.

The film haunts the viewer much in the way that the world continues to be haunted by the events of August 6 and 9, 1945.  Images linger in the mind long after the film ends, some horrific others hauntingly sad: a reunion of two brothers--one who has been burned so badly beyond recognition that the other at first draws back from touching him and asks for his name, the expedition to see the carp, and Yuichi surrounding Yasuko's house with the Jizo statues.  Suffice to say that this is a film that must be seen.

The sad reality, however, is that this film is no longer available to the public, except in the form of very expensive used editions of the DVD.  Because I feel strongly that this film deserves to be seen (especially given our highly fraught present) I have begun a petition that I am sending to a number of important international directors to restore and re-release the film.  My hope is that in doing so the film will soon be available to  the public again.

427596,5,6302096251,"The title refers to the radioactive fallout which fell upon Hiroshima after the dropping of the first atomic bomb on August 6, 1945. The story follows Yasuko and her uncle and aunt five years after the blast, with flash-backs to the day itself.

The film is shot in stark black and white that reminds one of the documentaries of the 1950's and 1960s. The total absence of any color draws attention to the characters and the horrors that befall them.

Yasuko and her uncle and aunt are unhurt. But we see them struggle through the devastated city. I have never seen any images that better portray what happened in Hiroshima than the scenes of them escaping the destruction. They are surrounded by horribly disfigured people, totally burnt with their skin hanging in tatters like old rags of clothing. Everywhere lay the black remains of burnt people. When they cross a shallow river, dead people float like the lanterns that are released on rivers during August when Japanese remember their ancestors.

In color this would have been tacky and sensational. In black and white it is disturbing and impressive. You immediately understand why the US government has tried so hard to suppress such images. The message is clear, the use of the atomic bomb is utterly inhuman.

The shocking images of the disfigured survivors is in stark contrast to the portrayal of the quiet mountain village life that anchors the story. The beautiful pastoral valley, without the concrete, highways and power lines that now dominate Japan's landscape, insinuates tranquil peace and a sense of well-being and health. A kind of simple paradise on earth. But the hibakusha's (bomb survivors) reality is far removed from this image.

Yasuko and her uncle and aunt live in constant fear of the radioactivity they were exposed to. Around them their best friends die one by one from this mysterious disease. Outwardly they appear completely fine, but they die nonetheless.

""Black Rain"" very keenly displays the terrible societal prejudices that hibakusha endured. Villagers complain about the weak bomb survivors apparent ""laziness"". Yasuko's friends won't see her, afraid they will make her sick, no man will marry her. Yasuko is now a pariah who is unable to find a husband. When she shows papers from her doctor stating a clean bill of health, suitors end up being even more convinced of her sickness.

But through all this inhumane treatment also flows the thread of a warm humanity. Yasuko's understanding of Yuichi, a former soldier in the imperial Japanese army who finds himself back in the midst of the front whenever he hears an engine, tells of her own invisible suffering. The love that grows between them is rooted in immeasurable pain and therefore all the more sincere.

The film is full of subtle cultural references that tell an enlightening story about what is happing inside the hearts of the characters. As Yasuko's inescapable fate slowly becomes clearer, Yuichi places Jizo statues, he has created himself, in front of her house. Jizo is a Buddhist guardian deity who protects children, travellers, expectant mothers and the weak in general. He is considered the ""Savior from the Torments of Hell"".

Yasuko's uncle releases carp repeatedly and they become an important symbol. These glorious fish signify endurance to the Japanese. Hiroshima's baseball team is actually named after them.

I can't think of any other film that has so masterfully captured the horrors and cruelty of the atomic bomb, and in such a quiet and dispassionate manner. There is not a grain of sensationalism to be found. Just the depiction of family life filled with warmth that is torn apart. The atomic bomb, ""Black Rain"" says, tears apart the very fabric of society. A bitter warning.",1124409600,6,3755,5.003205128205129

Hundred of books, and miles and miles of ink have been written about this delicate issue. Imamura simply shows the human effort for surviving after the catastroph, getting around the political connotations. Kurosawa, with Rhapsody in August made a nostalgic gaze and even post modernist reflection emphasizing the importance of the familiar unity under all the adversities.

But Imamura literally drowned in those turbulent waters and as you can imagine the result is not easy to accept. We tend to look to another side when we have to face this ethic problem.

Rating = ***

DVD
1989

Film = a solid three (3) stars; translations barely three (3) stars.  [Editorial Note: The horror of witnessing nuclear annihilation is impossible to image (at least it is for me).  The horror of just visiting holocaust museums in Hiroshima and/or Nagasaki may leave you depressed for days (like it did me).]  Director Shohei Imamura tries mightily (and within budget) to reimage Hiroshima's vaporization, but soon moves on from this impossible task to more familiar (and more-or-less predictable) territory by concocting a post apocalyptic shomin-geki [house drama] tale about the lives and deaths of nuclear-attack survivors.  But this, of course, is far from the usual shomin-geki trivia of old.  Those suffering from radiation poisoning are shunned (even made fun of) by the healthy, as survivors seem to be ""insufficiently"" Japanese!  Traditional match makers have to deal with the very real possibility that their prospective grooms and/or brides may die suddenly and without warning (even after having survived for many years)!  The film contains many more riveting vignettes for those tying to some how image what it might be like to survive a nuclear blast.  Cinematography (semi wide screen, black and white) is good, but scene lighting is a bit on the dark side.  Restoration is fine. The film's score is performed by a mid-sized orchestra that adds much to the on-screen drama.  Dialog subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, and in two colors when two characters are chatting.  This is a nice touch, but translations are often too long given their fast flash rate.  Expository information (sometimes superfluous) appears at the top of the screen in white.  This dual use of data streams is a great concept, but very poorly executed.  Expository data streams also are often too long given their fast flash rate.  And they frequently compete with dialog subtitles for the viewer's divided attention.  Data-overload city!  (Both or either one can be turned of.)  Viewing this movie is far from a fun experience, but, nonetheless, a recommended--if not necessary--one.
