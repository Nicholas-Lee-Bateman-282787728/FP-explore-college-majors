2799155,2,B000ORDM7C,"It's amazing that this Lions' Gate release of the Alf series is being advertised as ""complete""---these episodes were cut for syndication, pressed onto DVD, and foisted on unsuspecting fans.  Casual viewers probably won't spot it, but real fans of the show who enjoyed the wisecrack humor will find not only dialogue but entire SCENES missing. After the first season DVD being a big disappointment, I repeated my error and bought the second season, figuring a hatcheted ALF was better than none....but it was just irritating to watch. I won't buy any of the Lions' Gate releases, hoping that someday some real professionals will release the show the way it was made to be seen. (They send people to the moon;  it shouldn't be hard to find real COMPLETE seasons.)",1186272000,126,761,4.891472868217054

So my husband talked me into it, we watched it together and loved and laughed. There was just one huge issue though.... The 4th season is completely messed up, glitchy and unwatchable. I think that's a world wide issue though. Sucks, but oh well! Still love the rest of the series! Even the menus and intos to each episode are hilarious! Alf is so funny! Well worth the money even with the glitchy disc! ""HA!""",1390003200,,512,4.23469387755102
2799241,2,B000ORDM7C,"If so, these DVDs are for you! Make no mistake -- ALF is a classic of the late 1980's. A bit cheesy, yes, but still very enjoyable. The show itself deserves at least 4 stars.

So why did I give it only two stars? Unfortunately, these DVDs contain the chopped up versions of each episode that you see in syndication. This means that they cut up each episode as it originally aired and left two - three minutes of it on the cutting room floor. That's a tenth of each episode. Worse, the scenes that were cut were mostly those immediately preceding or immediately following the commercial breaks on the originals, which means that many of the very best scenes got the ax. They did this so that more commercials could be added when the episodes played in syndication. But WHY, oh WHY, would they use these mangled versions on the DVDs, where of course there are no commercials?

Want the full episodes as they originally aired back in the '80s? You'll have to seek the European DVDs. These are invariably quite elusive and therefore very expensive. And they're Region 2, meaning you probably can't play them on a US or Canadian DVD player -- you'll have to rip them on your computer to watch them. But at least they let you watch the episodes the way they were intended to be enjoyed...",1389830400,2,1282,4.497854077253219

I watched Alf in the 80's and haven't seen these episodes since then and I am still laughing my you-know-what off at the shows.  The downside I am finding is the quality of the manufacturing.  In my Season One set, four of the episodes on DVD 1 were corrupt and could not be watched.  Also, the entire DVD 3 was missing!  There were also a couple of other shows in the set that were corrupt and could not be played.

So, we called the seller and have received a replacement set.  So far, this set is better but not perfect.  I'm now into Season Three and while no episodes have been corrupt they wouldn't play, a few episodes have hung up for a few seconds before continuing.

Overall, I am so happy this series is on DVD but I am very disappointed in the quality if the DVDs.  The manufacturing process was sloppy and poor.  Come on, a whole DVD was missing from Season One?  Unacceptable.",1389052800,,954,4.297752808988764

I love the character of Alf, who in spite of being sarcastic and sometimes a bit hard to deal with, has a big heart. I also like the human characters and they have good chemistry on the show. Being a woman, I also always pay attention to the female characters, as it seems like they are done wrong on so many shows. Not so with Alf. The female characters are generally portrayed well and are given nearly as much focus as Willy, who is the main character after Alf. My only complaint is that these are the cut versions of the show. I would have loved to see the uncut versions, especially since I found out that other countries like Germany and Japan have uncut releases of the show.

Picture is scattered and sound is partially missing on those episodes,  A season two disc has no visible scuffs but several episodes can't be watched due to broken picture and sound.  I was so discouraged that I haven't tried to watch more.
After a bit I went on to Season Two.  No scuffs on those discs but terrible quality, broken picture and sound.  Completely unwatchable.  I wouldn't buy from this seller again.  Seems to be zero quality control.",1504742400,,705,4.873949579831932
