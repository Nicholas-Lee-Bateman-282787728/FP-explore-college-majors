6546124,3,B00M115G96,"I'm pleased to be able to rewatch one of my favorite shows from my childhood, but I think Nickelodeon really could have done more in these releases. For one, they are DVD-R's, not true DVD's (some media players may not play DVD-R's). This is just a way for Nick to maximize profits, but devalues Nick's adult fan base.

The media quality is pretty much as basic as it gets. The menu screen is bare bones-- there isn't even any music in the background. There are no bonus extras, commentary, etc. And why haven't they made the 6th and 7th seasons? Again, I'm happy to see the show and now be able to watch it whenever I please, but these DVD's could have been so much better.",1499644800,,674,4.349206349206349
6546125,5,B00M115G96,"Have you ever purchased a whole Season on DVD because you were in love with one episode? ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" was a guilty pleasure for me during the 90s. It was basically a pre-teen ""Twilight Zone"" and somewhat more mature than ""Goosebumps."" The series covered a number of teenagers sitting around a campfire and telling light horror tales and almost-a-ghost stories. Creative, yes, but hardly substantial. The one episode I recall most is ""Tale of the Bookish BabySitter,"" my favorite episode. It stars Natalie Radford as an attractive young babysitter who is well-liked by her charges and clients. During a new employer, she encounters a boy who doesn't like reading, and after skimming over one of her books. the characters become real, and he has to complete the tale to escape it. It's campy and cheesy, the special effects are bad, the storyline is kind of silly, but it's so much more appealing than any of the bad movies of the 50s and 60s, and that's why I think the series has so much charm among it's fans.",1499472000,,1027,4.679558011049724

6546140,4,B00M115G96,"I used to watch these after school everyday up until they got the new younger Midnight Society. I love these shows and I knew my step kids would like them too, so I bought volume 1 and now, volume 3. The kids ended up loving these episodes as much as I did and still do and now I'm debating on which next one to buy because the kids want to see more!

My favorite episodes are:
Apartment 214 (creepy)
Watcher's woods
Curious camera
Dangerous soup
Bookish babysitter
Carved stone
Dollmaker
Quicksilver
Dream girl (has a 50's feel to it)

Worst:
Crimson clown
Midnight ride
Phone police
Guardian's curse

It does tell you on the back, which episodes are on what discs so I really like that. (volume 1 does not) But the issue I have with this season is we have a few episodes that glitch and it's brand new out of the factory seal.",1469750400,,828,4.329032258064516

6546156,5,B00M115G96,"Are You Afraid of the Dark, in it's third season, is in full swing. Out are David and Kristen from seasons 1 and 2. In is Tucker - Gary's baby brother - and Samantha (Sam) - a tomboy friend of Betty Ann who Gary immediately takes a liking to. Tucker and Sam are a nice addition to the Midnight Society ad their audition stories are quite memorable. Overall this season is good. There are some scary episodes. There are some episodes that aren't as scary but still great. There are, of course, a few clunkers. I will list below my favorite episodes and my not so favorite episodes.

TOP 3 FAVORITE EPISODES OF THE SEASON:
The Tale of the Quicksilver (featuring Tatyana Ali from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and the twin of Jason Alisharan (Frank), Kyle Alisharan)
The Tale of Watcher's Woods (very dark and creepy)
The Tale of Apartment 214 (that sweet old lady was creepy as hell)

TOP 3 LEAST FAVORITE EPISODES OF THE SEASON:
The Tale of the Phone Police (yawn - one of Tucker's stories - a cautionary tale but not exactly scary)
The Tale of the Dollmaker (not scary - plus we never find out who the dollmaker is)
The Tale of the Dream Girl (not my favorite episode but legend has it, the plot to M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense was inspired by this episode)

The scariest episode - which I still have trouble watching - is The Tale of the Dangerous Soup which features a young Neve Campbell. That episode deals with mortal fears and it is so well-written and hard-hitting. Definitely the perfect episode to close out the season with.

If you have enjoyed the past two seasons of Are You Afraid of the Dark - you should enjoy this one!",1445212800,2,1640,4.438538205980066

6546169,4,B00M115G96,"To keep this concise, I'll share my immediate thoughts regarding both the DVD product and the content separately:

The DVD:
-Suitable Packaging (LOVE the old book art since it's a show about telling campfire stories)
-Discs have high-quality art on them
-DVD menus are as basic as it gets, though the old page texture for the menu background is appropriate
-Episodes are according to airing, not production order (which is why some Midnight Society members tell two stories in a row)

The Content:
-A stong season that blends the old feeling from earlier seasons with the new from later seasons; The season where Frank and Kristin leave
-Best Episodes: The Tale of Watcher's Woods, The Tale of The Guardian's Curse, The Tale of the Dream Girl (I swear the first time you watch this one, you'll be crying tears of sorrow, then tears of joy)
-Worst Episodes: The Tale of the Phone Police, The Tale of the Crimson Clown, The Tale of the Dollmaker
-Tucker and Samantha join the Midnight Society in Frank and Kristin's place, and each add their own flavor to the group (Sam tells slightly better stories than Tucker)
-Better presentation, tone, and variety than Goosebumps or Eerie Indiana
-If you only could get one season and you don't care about watching them in-order, get this one first. Otherwise, start with season 1, and work your way forward.

Summary:
This is an amazingly entertaining show to watch either by yourself (for the memories) or with your kids, if they are into camping or scary (but not horrifying) stories. Get the whole set of 5 seasons if you can, and be prepared for Season 6 and 7 releases should Amazon listen to this feedback and release them ;)",1436832000,8,1670,4.751724137931035

Bought from a collectors standpoint.
There's not much to this DVD other than it being repackaged to be resold at a cheaper price.

Looking to collect all of the seasons to relive my childhood. :)

It's been a hard task to find the seasons outside of random collector volumes, and some older seasons that are no longer printed.

Definitely recommend this for anyone who was a fan!
