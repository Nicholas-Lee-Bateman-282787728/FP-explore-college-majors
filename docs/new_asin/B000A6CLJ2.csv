8074822,3,B000A6CLJ2,"Not often that you get a chance to watch a Canadian-UK-Lithuanian film made entirely in English. While it appears not to be a made for television picture, I would rank it as comparable to the lowest level of the average of such movies. The action takes place mostly in a nuclear power plant and in a subway of Russia. The chief protagonists are  an English speaking family and the Russian staff of the power plant. The main action involves the occurrence of an earthquake that affects the nuclear generator and the efforts to prevent an explosion of massive force; a side sequence involves saving the family's daughter who is trapped in a wrecked subway line. It is difficult to evaluate the actors since they seemed constrained by the dialogue and the  plot to rather a simplicity of speech. The plot itself does not differ much from the standard in both excellent and poor movies.
Should anyone be moved to buy and watch this film on DVD, I would recommend doing so by buying the collection, 6-Movie Pack: Disaster
(2011). By doing so, you get this and five other ""disaster"" films for the price of this one taken alone (Price: $4.99  Prime). I have not viewed any in the collection as yet, but it is likely you will find more than one that will at least equal and possibly exceed the entertainment provided by 'Earthquake'.",1373241600,,1325,4.653846153846154
8074823,2,B000A6CLJ2,"High on the list of things you don't want to bring together are Russian nuclear plants and earthquakes - unless you want to make a disaster film.  Just make sure your writer and director understand that you want a disaster film rather than a film disaster.  Okay, maybe film disaster is a little too strong of a phrase, but Nature Unleashed: Earthquake is an average film at best.  I don't know about the earthquake, but the movie hits at least a 9.0 on the Richter scale of film clichs.  Divorced husband and wife forced together to deal with an unprecedented disaster - check; kids separated and in imminent danger if not rescued - check; boorish, uncaring nuclear plant manager who ignores all safety measures and cares only about his own survival - check.  And let's not forget the desperate, last-minute, seat-of-your-pants, brainstorm idea to try and somehow prevent a complete meltdown of the core of the shoddily-engineered plant.  As for the special effects -well, they're just lousy for the most part, including the scenes reportedly borrowed or stolen from other films.

I could actually summarize the plot here, but it's really not worth the effort.  Even if you've never seen a single film in this genre, the whole story is ridiculously predictable from start to finish.  Andy Hurst's script is tedious to the extreme, and Tibor Takcs just compounds the great faults in the story and dialogue with his paint-by-numbers directing.  This really isn't even an earthquake movie, as far as I'm concerned.  Sure, there are tremors and finally a major earthquake that set the central events in motion, but the real story revolves around the classic Russian engineering of the Chernobyl-esque nuclear plant and the possibility of the exceedingly unnatural disaster of a nuclear core meltdown.  Nature Unleashed: Earthquake is really more about man's folly than nature's fury.",1255305600,,1880,5.048543689320389
8074824,2,B000A6CLJ2,"Take this movie as a movie that could play on TV and you won't be dissapointed.  ive seen lots of earthquake movies..and some are really really bad, but this one...is not that bad.",1226966400,,180,4.454545454545454
8074825,4,B000A6CLJ2,"An earthquake cripples a Russian nuclear power plant threatening a meltdown, and it's a race against time to avert the disaster. Add into the mix a Russian supervisor who refuses to accept the idea of anything wrong, and will stop at nothing to keep the truth from getting out, even if it means locking the engineer near the core, and trying to run away when confronted with the truth.

This movie is well-paced, and doesn't take long to get started. And once it gets going, you're on a rollercoaster ride of suspense. The scene in the elevator shaft reminds me of the suspense in TOWERING INFERNO and POSEIDON ADVENTURE. The kids are very believable American youngsters trying to deal with their parents' separation, and fate forces them to work together. Maybe it's all cliche, maybe not. But I like this movie. Maybe the special effects were taken from DANTE'S PEAK (as one reviewer from IMDB mentioned), I don't know. Frankly, I don't care, since they're very brief and quick. Only when scenes are obviously stolen from other movies do I care, like when they stole footage from AIRPORT 1975 to create SONIC IMPACT. But try it yourself. You may be surprised.",1185494400,,1161,4.776119402985074
8074826,3,B000A6CLJ2,"One in a series of NATURE UNLEASHED disaster flicks, this one details an earthquake in Russia that threatens a meltdown at a nuclear power plant, one that could wipe out a million people.  Into this maelstrom comes an energy representative who visits the plant to insure its ready to go online.  This rep happens to be the ex-husband of the plant's manager, who has his two teenage children living with her in Russia.  The special fx look borrowed from previous films (one reviewer on IMDB says it's DANTE'S PEAK?).  There's little that isn't predictable, and the acting is barely adequate, but it holds you long enough to get involved in the disaster, and it has the requisite happy ending.",1137715200,,691,4.781512605042017
8074827,1,B000A6CLJ2,"Earthquake: Nature Unleashed (Tibor Takacs, 2004)

Ah, Tibor Takacs, the man who has me half-convinced that the Sci-Fi Channel really does commission its original films rather than picking up things that couldn't get distributed any other way. The plot, for what it is: a series of earthquakes warns, then strikes, a Russian nuclear plant. The warnings are, of course, ignored by the head of the plant, who presses on at the behest of the greedy American company trying to get the thing online while not straying too far over budget. Of course, to pound in the message, the representative of said company and its safety consultant used to be married, and they have two kids who are in danger because the plant's core might melt down and any second and wipe Russia off the map.

That you can possibly ask ""why should we care?"" at such a premise is the mark of a truly bad movie, and that's exactly what you'll find yourself asking numerous times here. The script is atrocious, the acting even more so (including one actor who comes off so wooden it's impossible to figure out whether he's supposed to be playing a Russian trying to speak English-- without a trace of an accent, mind you-- or an American who's simply a really bad actor. Either way, the effect is hilarious). The plot is horribly thin, far too much so to hold this mess together. Avoid at all costs. (zero)",1124236800,,1371,4.637860082304527
