8184205,2,B000AAW0FS,I have several of these Videos and like them.  This one is very hard to follow because it is done in a MAll setting - hard to hear Leslie's instructions and get the beat and so much video confustion/distraction looking all around the MALL.  Great she had that much of an audience but like the videos from the studio much better.,1344816000,,328,4.360655737704918
8184206,5,B000AAW0FS,"Leslie is at the Monroeville Mall in western PA; they have a large stage set up for the instructors, on the mall floor are a lot of exercisers in matching tee shirts, shoppers on the second level hanging over watching the activity, and a camera crew filming the half-hour live exercise class.  I wish I could have been there, it would have been so much fun.  Next best thing is pretending you're there as the video runs.  The video has some of my favorite walkers in it, too, see if you can spot Carol and Nancy in the exercising 'audience'.  This is a typical half-hour two-mile workout, and it's fun to do because you're watching all these different people.",1176076800,,659,4.512605042016807
