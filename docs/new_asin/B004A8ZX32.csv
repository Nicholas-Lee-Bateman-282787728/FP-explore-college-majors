4300068,5,B004A8ZX32,"Certainly deserves, that is, must be seen on the large screen to be appreciated. Tree of Life is some two and a half hour of majestic, sumptuous pictures and images with a minimalist plot that can only be inferred. A movie almost entirely told through pictures. This is my take:

One of if not the most difficult experiences for a parent to endure is when ones child dies before they do.  The death is off-screen and never explained. Why Why Why? If there is a God, why did this happen? If there is divine purpose directing our lives, what can be the purpose to violating the natural order and the child dying first. If God can create and order this vast universe and nature throughout history, why would he take my child, the fifties mother (Jessica Chastain) contemplates these questions. What is the plot here?

We see beautiful glimpses of a very fifties family in Waco Texas. Father, stern, strict but ultimately loving, stay-at-home, dreamy mother plays with her three boys, makes meals and quietly supports the decisions of her husband, played by Brad Pitt.  Brad works in the factory but would have preferred a job playing organ or piano, his talent and interest. Life is tough and you have to be tough to survive, he tried to teach his sons.  Kids experience a world without media, cell phones, x-boxes, TV's (!) where they use their imaginations in play. The experiences of Waco effect the child Jack O'Brien who becomes the adult played by Sean Penn. What is the purpose of life? Why did his younger brother die and him live? Fights with his father, rebellion. From this idyllic fifties setting, Jack O'Brien grows to be an architect designing huge soulless glass and steel monstrosities. Fights with his father go on in his head. This movie offers a lot of questions and no answers.

Much of this is seems autobiographical of director Terrence Malick.

We see stunningly beautiful pictures of life, underwater, of earth from space, Pictures not seen since in movies ""2001, a Space Odyssey"". Pictures from the Hubble telescope. Perhaps heaven. A extremely visual movie. A movie of pictures from the perspective of God. The end of days when ""the sea shall give up it's dead"".

Director Malick throws in a soundtrack with a lot of classical music, Bach etc. But repeatedly plays Francois Couperin's ""Les Baricades Misterieuses"" -the mysterious barricades - to underline his point...

I think people with children and people who who have religion in their lives will marvel at this movie. Others will wonder what the fuss is about.",1308528000,59,2539,4.818390804597701
4300069,5,B004A8ZX32,"A film that opens with a family dealing with a death. The story of the family is then told, as a couple falls in love, marries and has children. The father raises his boys in a very strict manner, at times engendering resentment, particularly with his oldest. The story is bookended with sequences representing the beginning and end of life. The film concludes with the mother giving one of her sons to god, after his death at 19. This movie is very realistically told, with the setting of the late 50's and early 60's convincingly used, and the everyday love and conflict within the family unit present throughout the film. Sean Penn is featured briefly in the beginning and the end, and is remembering the upbringing of him and his now dead brother. A well told story that engages the viewer, and with a little patience, is definitely worth the time invested.",1308441600,4,861,4.671052631578948
4300070,1,B004A8ZX32,"Visually this is a fine film albeit no better than a trip to a great planetarium or certain IMAX films.  Otherwise, The Tree of Life is a pretentious and extremely feeble attempt to philosophize about everything from the creation of the universe to the interrelations in dysfunctional families, particularly the questionable and for the most part reprehensible treatment of children (even the ""radiant"" mother being a pathetic model).  One could learn more about these things by simply listening to the Mahler and Brahms works (and others)  offered as a sound palette to accompany the visual wonders.

The film leaves more questions about its creator and the actors who lent themselves to the project than it does to real feeling and intellectual or emotional depth.  What was Malick looking for?  Why did he choose the particular storyline he did and how does it illustrate universal concerns?  Why are there benevolent dinosaurs? Are nature and grace really so easily explained as we are told? Are we to think that all families experience these same alienations?
Where in the movie is there any real acting?  Who now are Pitt and Penn?  Why did we spend money on this film?",1308355200,17,1175,4.954081632653061
4300071,1,B004A8ZX32,"""The Tree of Life""...

Staring pensively, I ride the elevator down a level after exiting the theater.
Unknown voices ricocheting in my head. ""Mother, father, forever you wrestle inside me"".
Can Sean Penn be any more dour?
Kids run and play in Waco, Texas, circa 1960s, a more innocent time, fondness, conflict.
Scenes of nature, form and function, interfere throughout the film.

Story needs to be focused, someone needs to help Malick do this.
Untold images of nature, seashells, waves crashing, animals coursing.
Creation? The Birth of Mankind? Evolution? Really?
Kills any momentum built from what little narrative exists.
Sean Penn is in about ten minutes of the film.

So many shots of people waving their hands through the air.
Undulating light filters through their fingers.
Can't understand why this is a recurring image. Hope of freedom?
Kind of repetitive in many places. Many shots of Mom waving her foot through the lawn sprinkler.
Sort of creepy, because Son seems to be watching this with a little too much interest

Should Pitt and Penn embrace this type of film? Give it legitimacy?
Unfortunately, they both said yes because of their previous relationship with Malick.
Couldn't look past the lack of narrative, disconnected images, bad metaphors.
Kisses are on each of the children's cheeks, placed with love by Mom (Jessica Chastain).
Seems like the film is telling a personal story, one that Malick wants to tell.

Seems like Malick alone is the only one who understands what is going on.
Until he is ready to tell a story, he shouldn't make the film.
Can this really be a film? No narrative, more like a visual poem.
Kindly refrain from the self-indulgence, please Mr. Malick.
Sincere thanks, in advance.

Scenes flow throughout, brief shots, basically just images, little to connect them.
Unusually little dialogue, a lot of voiceover provided by son. Voice does not fit maturity.
Cuts back and forth, from present day, to Creation, to childhood, to the afterlife.
King prawns, whales, waves, seashells, stained glass, swirling sand.
So many disparate ideas, thought, images. Really, the afterlife? Yes, the afterlife.

Silently, Mom watches Dad yell and shout and take out his frustrations on children.
Until waves crash, protozoa swim, cells regenerate. No, not kidding.
Children run and play and get in mischief. A more innocent time, a fondly remembered time..
Kids grow up and Sean Penn plays the adult. He stares silently into space.
Silently dealing with his demons, his child self provides too adult voiceover.

Some think this film is brilliant. Really, they want to seem smart, by 'liking' this 'Tree'.
Unnatural sound and feel to what little dialogue there is.
Cannes gave it the Palm D'or. Their most prestigious.
Kind of reinforces bad stereotypes about 'independent' film for many.
Such a waste of time, Terence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"".",1307059200,25,2874,5.087048832271762
4300072,5,B004A8ZX32,"Last night my wife Kathleen and I were in the Los Angeles audience at a sold-out performance of Terrence Malick's new film, ""THE TREE OF LIFE."" Crammed into the front row so we had to crane our necks at the enormous screen, I can nevertheless safely say that this movie far exceeded my expectations.

This is a film of staggering genius that ranks with other life-defining encounters I've had with great art. It's a work for the ages that will take its place alongside Beethoven's Seventh, Mozart's 40th, Shakespeare's ""HAMLET,""  T.S. Eliot's ""FOUR QUARTETS,"" Dostoyevsky's ""THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV,"" Tolstoy's ""WAR AND PEACE,"" Melville's ""MOBY DICK,"" Leonardo da Vinci's ""VIRGIN ON THE ROCKS,"" Victor Hugo's ""LES MISERABLES,"" William Faulkner's ""THE SOUND AND THE FURY,"" Picasso's ""GUERNICA,"" Rodin's ""THE LOVERS,"" Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling, Andrei Tarkovsky's ""STALKER,"" and Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY"". (It's significant that Douglas Trumball, who created the mindbending special effects for ""2001"" was a technical advisor for this film's special effects team.)

Malick plumbs the mind of God to bring us glimpses of the universe's genesis--indeed, he shows us the moment when God whispered ""Let There Be Light""--while also taking us to the end of days, where all of us will be reunited with our lost loved ones in our Father's house of many mansions. Don't look for a conventional plot. The ""plot"" is life itself.

Malick evokes cosmic scale by refracting his tale through the prism of one humble, dysfunctional family in Waco, Texas, where Malick himself grew up. I don't know how much of this film is autobiographical. I can say that the 1950s Texas he grew up in looked, in this film, very much like the Waycross, Georgia I grew up in. But never before have I seen a film that so effectively captures a child's birth, growth, and fall from innocence. Never mind that Brad Pitt turns in a stellar performance as the child's bitter, frustrated father. The actors--indeed, all the spoken lines and events--are incidental to the imagistic theme: that we are moving in a repeating pattern of birth, innocence, fall from innocence, decline, death, rebirth and salvation, down through the ages, and time will one day end when God's plan has been fulfilled.

Malick's cinematographer achieves his breathtaking effects by showing people moving in graceful, swirling arcs, much as Kubrick's cinematographer did in the space shuttle sequence in ""2001"". The camera is always moving, and the movement captured is the dance of life. Curiously, in this film dominated by spellbinding images, a searingly memorable line of dialog comes from the child's mother near the film's end: ""You must live with love. If you don't love, your life will pass in a flash."" The subtext is clear: love is the point--the alpha and omega--of the universe and its seemingly chaotic rush toward dissolution. And in the end, there is only the Light, as it was in the beginning.",1306713600,127,2972,5.106995884773663
4300073,5,B004A8ZX32,"It's a film about love and nothing else except its succeeding and failing through and beyond death. The eighteen year old eldest son of this family dies and the film is the full description of the process of mourning for the father and the mother of that child who had two other brothers and these son's mourning is intertwined into that of their parents. That explains the practically uncontrollable expression of pain and suffering of the beginning and the rather tamed final scene of that mourning after or around the burial of the son or brother.

The mourning process is psychologically traumatic to the two parents and sends them back into the past. Since the son died then this death's concatenation with what we know of how he lived explains, justifies or caused this death. They start from the beginning, from their own encounter, and then all the important events in the family, for the parents and for the children will punctuate what happens on the screen. The point is that the whole film is a collage and that makes it difficult to follow but fascinating to the eyes.

Difficult to follow because actually fully acted scenes with a fully developed dialogue are rare and short. Most of the film is the evocation of events in purely visual scenes and special effects. Passion, birth, that enormous trauma for the parents and the child is systematically evoked by volcano eruptions, lava flowing, incandescent pictures over-invading the screen.

Those scenes are meaningful because of the linear and transitive line of the visual show. It would be a mistake to identify one of these visual effects as having a clear meaning. It is never the case and the volcanic eruption comes several times, each time carrying the memory of the previous time and enriching the new instance with its clustered circumstantial new meaning.

Three sons in one family make the Oedipian complex of one of them, in that case the one who will die at eighteen, the eldest son, difficult to assume and negotiate. The father wants to literally possess his eldest son and he wants his wife to reject this son, in order to reinforce the father's takeover. It does not work because the father does not understand the attachment to the mother is natural and the inspiration from the father has to be based not on the rejection of the mother but on the project the son may have for himself.

A severe economic crisis in the family will naturally build tremendous frustrations and thus will support a never clearly said vision that the death of the eldest son was the result of his suicide death instinct rooted in the deep resentment of the extreme and even excessive authority of the castrating father.

But the film is a great film because the plot could be made explicit and detailed in one page, whereas in this film most of it is the expression if not telling of that plot along two visual lines. On one hand the parallel between the visual effects on the screen and the story of the film. On the other side the architecture of the visual medium, effects, scenes. Then it becomes the plot of the visual effects, how they progress and build a beginning, a middle and an end.

We have to feel that plot, that depth, that drama in the mourning with our eyes and ears but not with our brain or linguistic capability. This film is thus the acme of cinematographic art since it mainly speaks to us through its visual and auditory , if not only sonorous, mediatic dimensions.

That cinema is a universal language and the words, the few words, are no longer important, except in their tones, in their musical dimension.

4300074,4,B004A8ZX32,"*This contains some spoilers...kind of. It's difficult to spoil a film like this*

I had never seen a Terrence Malick film before The Tree of Life. Despite not having any sort of expectations, the final product still wasn't what I imagined it would be. The trailer didn't really reveal much of anything either, at least as far as the story is concerned. Brad Pitt plays the father of a boy who eventually grows up to be Sean Penn. That's about it. While The Tree of Life may come off as slightly pretentious and more than a little overbearing, it's difficult to argue that it isn't exactly that. But at least it offers an incredible cinematic vision in the meantime.

The cinematography in The Tree of Life is truly mesmerizing. Every frame seems to tell its own unique story thanks to the way it was shot and the vibrant colors that are used throughout the film. Malick has a way of making things like trees, waterfalls, and shadows seem way more spectacular than they really are. There's a fascination with the third person perspective as we're constantly staring at the back of the actors as they react to the extraordinary world around them. Everything in the film just seems to be so full of life.

Less delightful things in life are shown in a fantastic light, as well. Devastation and how it's portrayed is one of them. Jessica Chastain's emotionally powerful reaction to the letter she receives in addition to Brad Pitt's face slowly melting into a look of both recognition and sorrow as the sun bathes his look of despair as he receives this news over the phone illustrates this point to perfection. Dying trees and the way their branches plague the sky leave a fairly large impact, as well. Then there's the use of colors in the film. There's a heavy use of green for scenes that take place in the past while shades of gray are littered throughout the present. White is also used to symbolize innocence. Clouds and the sky in general are utilized throughout the film while skyscrapers seem to replace trees in present day. Perhaps the most enthralling visuals are the scenes in space. The magnitude and vast infatuation of watching nebulae, planets, stars, and life from space as the film offers is something marvelous in itself.

The story is where the film stumbles. We're shown various different circles of life, so to speak, but the O'Brien family fits in there somewhere amongst outer space and dinosaurs and their story comes off a little forced rather than natural. Jack's childhood takes a front seat as we see him get into mischief with his friends and brothers and we eventually watch him develop issues towards his father, but it doesn't really go much deeper than that. A tragic event seems to bring the family together just as much as it pushes them apart. We're shown some of the trials and tribulations of life, but the story doesn't feel like it goes nearly as deep as the visuals do. The ending doesn't provide much closure either. Is Jack in heaven? Is this just his way of letting go of the past? Maybe it's just a way to symbolize his thoughts and emotional process? Is it acceptance? All of the above? The Tree of Life just left something to be desired when it came to its story.

The Tree of Life is beautifully shot and eloquently acted, but is a lot to take in and feels twice as long as its 138-minute duration. The film's score is breathtaking. In addition to its use of Brahms and original pieces, simple sounds like birds and wind chimes and nothing more during certain scenes made the film sound and feel like an expression of life itself rather than just appear to look like it. The Tree of Life is incredibly abstract yet gorgeous and engrossing. It just has trouble finding its footing when it comes to storytelling.",1306454400,10,3758,4.636636636636637

4300286,4,B004A8ZX32,"The viewer is immediately aware that a great tragedy, the untimely death of a son, is the event the movie centers around. However, at the beginning this death means little more to the viewer than the tragedy of any other stranger. However, as the story flashes back in time to the childhood of this unfortunate child, the reality of the pain and the significance of the tragedy takes on layers of meaning and pain. The most terrible angst is felt in witnessing the fathers mistakes with his sons: his blind ambition for more money, his constant criticism and perfectionism, his desire to be admired in others eyes which leads to a preoccupation with the lawn where he constantly derides his son for not making the grass look better, and his bad temper. The child is shown as struggling with the corruption eroding his soul from a difficult fathers influence and the constant devotion of his mother which beckons his soul to return to the light. All the ins and outs of his childhood have an acute drama knowing the untimely death his younger brother will face. The older brother has a difficult time, even into middle age, coping with the death of a younger brother for whom he often showed the same cruelty to that his father showed to himself.
But rather than being a blanket tragedy, there is every day joy carefully woven into the story as well. Even the difficult father is a complex character who sometimes shows genuine remorse for the way he treats the boys. The mother models how to forgive and how to find joy in hard circumstances. As other reviewers have said, its not your typical movie, but is its own distinct viewing experience that is as rich as it is unique.",1508544000,9,1676,4.62751677852349

They waited until 3/4 of the movie to show the father as an abusive bully, and by then the audience was so disconnected from the distant, unspeaking characters that it was hard to summon empathy for them.

That being said, I re-watched this movie with my new wife and it really re-ignited her creative drive as a freelancing videographer. So watch out...it may inspire your significant other in ways that put a strain on the stability of your current domestic breadwinning allocations. Thus far, nothing too disruptive to our equilibrium, but I'm definitely going to keep an eye on it. Like Brad in the film, I am uncertain about whether or not I'll make a good father and the question of ""how many?"" and ""how soon?"" lingers in the air of our apartment, haunting my imagination.

4300673,5,B004A8ZX32,"Ingmar Bergman observed that so far, film is in its infancy. Pure cinema is a film vocabulary that is just being developed.  Most films tell a story, are easily readable and digested.  But Tree of Life is a work of art that pushes at the boundaries of what we expect even from a Malick film.  When I first saw the film I admired it, but sighed at all the indulgences. (the dinosaurs!) (I thought then). That was in a movie theater - I returned to it at my computer, in a calm state, and to my surprise loved every single minute. When you're not expecting, you can simply see what's there.  So very much! I recognized the stunning originality--the constantly moving visual mosaic--not of a plot, but of life, the creation of the world on an abstract beautiful level and the patterns of an individual life--a troubled childhood, a happy family that moves into unhappiness and frustration through the life forces that batter it. More as archetypes - reflecting the fates of so many people and families. You are given a almost Proustian helping of tiny details --stunning movement and montage glue the scenes together with an inspired use of music.  The film ends on a beach--where reconciliation, and love and healing prevails -some imaginary paradise for family life.

So much of Malick's narrative sense asks you to imagine plot points - It begins with mourning a son we've never yet met who has died at nineteen. It suddenly moves to offices of a prosperous architect.  You connect him to the oldest son, and eventually realize he's taken in all the lectures of his frustrated failure of a father, and reaped fortune from them. At one point he apologizes for words they had over the phone about the funeral. What were they? You must imagine--perhaps ""you always loved him more than me.""  It's clear the hostility still boils.  Also, central to the truth of the story is the way perfectly well-meaning parents can develop toxic relations with one child only because the dynamics are off. Malick is very aware of this.

Days of Heaven is the Malick film where so many of the visual ideas of the film were taking shape. The dramatic use of montage and movement and imagery - with minimum dialogue- are all some of the hallmarks of pure cinema.  Here he goes as far as he can,
just sticking with emotional energy and imagery and composing a world of moments the way they would swirl in your head if you were remembering your life.

When I see so many one star reviews from angry film goers, I really sympathize.  Very many intelligent film goers remain in a comfortable world where originality, poetic vision, and a type of spiritual overview of life has very little meaning or worth.  It's all pretentious, boring nonsense.  This movie is one which pushes you out of your comfort zone.

I, for one, am grateful that such a film exists. I am absolutely certain it will lead others toward inspired film making of the future.",1478563200,26,2919,4.6608187134502925

4300729,1,B004A8ZX32,"Terence Malick has never been much of a story teller, but Tree of Life has only the suggestion of a story lost in this inchoate mess that includes a meaningless interlude about the creation of the universe, dinosaurs meandering about and killing each other and God knows what else. Brad Pitt plays a crew-cutted father of a two sons sometime in the '50s or '60s. Pitt is an engineer of some sort who is angry at the world; he wanted to be a composer but didn't try hard enough; he's also a would-be inventor whose schemes are only hinted at. One son dies in  combat or so it seems; even that is unclear. Pitt alternates between expressing his love for his son and inflicting draconian punishment on him for being playfully defiant of his father's authority. Jessica Chastain plays the mother, an ethereal, saintly cipher. Sean Penn plays the surviving son grown up who meanders around looking moody in big impersonal office building and then an arid landscape that resembles the Africa from the Dawn of Man sequence in 2001. The film finally, mercifully ends with everyone walking along a beach together (in an afterlife?) that recalls Jodie Foster's reunion with her dad in Contact.",1477353600,4,1183,4.770731707317073

4300864,5,B004A8ZX32,"I found this film to be technically a revelation, even while I wasn't particularly intrigued by the story or the message, which I found to be a bit on the sentimental side. But Malick has created a film that flows like music instead of like a linear drama and it was easy for me to get swept up in that flow.  Dialogue is often replaced with voiceovers, and the voiceovers are often just snatches of thoughts or comments that come and go like motifs in a symphony.  And visually it's all ethereal, the result, I guess, of Malick having shot so much of it in the light of the setting sun (what I think is called the ""golden hour"" in photography).  So it's not like a story being played out before your eyes, it's like the thoughts that would circle in your head if you were remembering all these events--perhaps like the thoughts of Sean Penn's character, who's reflecting on it all.  But Malick wants to tie this family's story in with universal phenomena, and the film begins with a lot of ""2001""-like scenes of cosmic creation.  I didn't mind this because it had its own visual appeal, but I was dismayed by the computer animation of dinosaurs; the tone of the film up to that point had been poetic but the animation flattened it to something like a video game.  Once past those scenes, the film regained its footing and I felt the cosmic introduction actually lent a bit of a transcendent feel to the story being played out in the everyday world.",1466467200,3,1449,4.46969696969697

It shows the many dangers children face, particularly when the family is dominated by an authoritarian father, and the sadness and powerlessness of the wife in that situation.  These themes are profoundly disturbing and make a strong impression.  The film is non-linear, and it experiments with imagery to represent state of mind and universality.

4301192,3,B004A8ZX32,"Although cinematically beautiful, the slow pace, overlong running time, and lack of a clear focus, make for a film that you stop several times to go to the kitchen and stretch for. It's format owes a great deal to the groundbreaking Kubrick film ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" from 1968 which has a much more coherent progression and delivers its art in a more appreciable style. Tree is muddled in its message about mixing religion and science and although its truths about married life and having children score some points with people comparing their own lives, ultimately it doesn't seem to add up to much for the time invested. At least Malick makes literate and engaging films as opposed to the drivel that Hollywood usually pumps out, and he is not afraid to experiment.",1452988800,,769,4.7894736842105265
4301193,3,B004A8ZX32,"The film directly addresses the themes that Malick has hinted at in previous films - the purpose of life, the function of family, how we at once are inextricably part of and at the same time transcend our parents and their influence.  The story is told as a series of disconnected scenes, mostly in the 1950s as Jack O'Brien and his brothers grow up and experience the trials of childhood and family life.  Along with this are a few scenes from the present of the adult Jack, and images of galaxies, nebulae, and prehistoric life.  All of this is presented with the utmost gravity; Malick's serious contemplation of Man's Place in the Cosmos is never in question, allowing him to get away with what might be pretentious in others.

As the father, Brad Pitt again demonstrates that he's a fine if understated actor; otherwise, there would be no reason for all the fuss.  Jessica Chastain as the mother is perhaps too ethereal for this particular role, but she's such a pleasure to watch that I'm willing to give her a pass.  Overall, however, the film suffers in comparison to Richard Linklater's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boyhood/dp/B00MEQUNIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boyhood</a>&nbsp;which came out a few years later and essentially covered the same territory.  It may be unfair to hold Malick to the standard set by Linklater's film, which was of far greater scope and in any case was much more challenging to shoot.  ""Tree of Life"" is nevertheless not on par with Malick's best work, notably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-World/dp/B001JDQXCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New World</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thin-Red-Line/dp/B003KGBIRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thin Red Line</a>, that to me showcase Malick's philosophical strengths while also telling a gripping story - which is where ""The Tree of Life"" falls short.

The other stuff, which concerns a grim family situation in 1950s Texas, was excellent in its own right. Brad Pitt was terrific as the tyrannical father and Jessica Chastain was quite gorgeous though, of course, playing the stereotypically submissive wife. The boys who played the sons were also excellent.

However, the family story was too long and drawn out and certainly if one were watching it in the cinema it would be quite an ordeal for both mind and backside. If Malick had edited this part of the film and cut about 30 minutes from it he would still have had a decent length 100 minute feature film and probably a masterpiece.

I got about 20 minutes into the film and got so bored I had to put int a different movie, because I felt I was going to fall asleep on the couch...I watched the The Jane Austen Book Club, which I just loved and thought I might hate.

And, that was when I realized that I had FORGOTTEN how amazing a director Terrence Malick is. With an almost 50 year career behind him, he has only directed 10 films(9 of which have been released). But his work is so amazing! THE TREE OF LIFE is about as strange a trip as you will probably take in a film. It's long, weird and very trippy, so be aware. Brad Pitt and Sean Penn star and do a great job, as do the rest of the cast. This is a three disc version, as you get a Blu-Ray, dvd and digital copy. Be aware, the digital copy is old school, where you have to insert the disc into your computer and transfer the files. No cloud storage here.",1435190400,,792,4.14935064935065

4301507,2,B004A8ZX32,"I'm a Terence Malick fan and have ""The Thin Red Line"" in my movie library, it is a movie I watch to enjoy the juxtaposition of man and nature. This is a theme that reoccurs in ""The Tree Of Life"" but where it succeeded in ""The Thin Red Line"" it fails miserably in ""The Tree Of Life"" because the story is so fractured and lacks continuity that the only theme that stands out is the child trying to grow to a man with an overbearing and, at times, brutal father whose long periods of absence are punctuated with his anger at the imagined forces that would hold him back in the world. The end offers no relief as death is presented as a doorway, on a mountain, with a dancer on the other side and finally meeting with friends and family on a beach. Maybe I'm missing something much deeper than I think but I have to say, after all the buildup I read about this movie, I'm glad I waited until the price went way down as it will not stay in my library.",1431907200,,946,4.118918918918919

4301511,5,B004A8ZX32,"One of the first movies I saw Brad Pitt act in was ""A River Runs Through It"" , circa 1994. The Landscape was the hills of Montana.  I have followed his career, and watched him mature and develop into an actor of great range depth and emotion. The tree of life seemed a bit abstract, only because the style used to convey the story was a abstract, somewhat geometrical. The essence seemed to be that the family, as we know it has gone the way of the dinasaur, extinct. That life, real, true and substantial is no longer....At what we are left with is something ..else.... we always have ..throughout time... the memories we love and cherish that keep us whole, contained, and human...Realness that transcends all space and time. Our memories can not be vandalized...erased..or obscurred... Good, loving memories...that...while sometimes difficult to grasp through the bombardment that is this world we have to live in...remain.... and can not be eclipsed... or blotted out by elemental forces vying for dominance.
...Where were you when I laid the foundations for the Earth? When the morning Stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for Joy? (JOB 38:4,7)  .... No one who ever loves the Way of Grace ever comes to a bad end........
The ""Tree of Life""... a family connected together by memories...feelings of love and grace... emotions..good and bad  love and anger.... the images the writer and producers used in the beginning of the film depicted nature, sealife..flowers..then the frame cuts iin and out sporadic into frames  with people..that somehow seem so disconnected..then after a while begin to make sense.  Some families have structure...some woven together in what seems perfect symmetry..others seem fragmented, disjointed... In the 1950's there were no fences, no bars on the windows and doors..... children could play outside with each other, unobstructed and free, exploring their world in all the purety and innocence ...The soild structure of the family... a strong work ethic, strong systems of belief strong family values that worked. Everyone knew where they stood... everyone had solid cohesiveness Everyone knew they fit in, and it all melded together, everyone shaped the environment so much so it was just.....good.....  The strictness was there...The stoic father figure.. strong, sure, infalliable... his ""Tough Love"" was in sheer contrast to and complimented that of the moma..always there to bring balance, to protect and act as a shield to the stark realities of life.... and the ""Thunder""....that sometimes was Dad's ""Tough Love
"".Things we take for granted now days, that we have learned to accept, like the disabled man making his way accross the street. In those days, stares gawks and ooglers when gaze in amazement. Those kind of people were kept out of sight and away from the view of ""Normal Folks"". When the boys Jack and Mike first got a glimpse of the harsh reality of life taken away and replaced with the shackles that go with prison,they seemed really shaken and disturbed. Moma smoothed over the images with loving care,,that it's alright..that life is not your life. The hobo or drunkard on the street, a staple of modern life  so it seems, was a rare image to behold in those days. The boys would point, laugh and mimick  the poor misbegotten soul. but in the making fun of those souls..was revealed a fear, that unexplained..what? and Why? and mom was there..to explain it all away..and make the images disappear like a puff of smoke..she always seemed to make sense of it all.  Then ...the scene changes and shifts ,,explosive images of erupting volcanoes like mount saint helene or mauna loa or kileua  ariel shots from above that depict the devastation and destructive nature that is nature..neverending and timeless. the shot moves..from outside to inside of a caldera then inside a smooth cavernous canyon.  Then, the cinematic backdrop to microscopic iimages of flora, ameoba and plant life, then to a lunar (could've been solar? eclipse) . Visually appealing to the eye, beautiful and awesomely wonderous. Swirling jellyfish, squid and plankton, the awesome coral reefs.....switch to the dessert...switch to green vegetation then...... to dinosaurs>>>primeval...primative setting to Tyrannasaurus rex, picking a fight over limited resources..It seemed as if the depiction of he dinasaurs were a comparison to the family as it used to be. That it is changing and we have to learn to adapt or become extinct... Our notions of what it means to be a family, shaped and molded for so many of us by television. While many really did aspire to have families as perfect as what we saw on the new fangled contraption called television... many also knew that hollywood had conjured up a box of contradictions and anomolies. And many knew it would (the fantasy of the perfect family) come back to bite us in the rear....literally and figuratively . But, I digress. That is how I saw the connection...some one else may interpret it differently. I also wondered, if Brad Pitt was conveying his angst dealing with his wife having made a choice to have a double masectomy and hysterectomy at such a young age and with no diagnosed cancer...???? all pre-emptive??? I wonder if that is why the allusions of the dinasaurs seemed so approbriate.  He seems the modern man..yes... but a the heart is still a man. How can all that slicing and dicing of Angelina Jolie sit right with him? anyway......I digress
Back to the movie...and the scene moves from the forrest to the birthing room where the mom and dad are introduced to son number one...Jack... It looked like a birthing room... maybe it was a hospital... but..the happiness and joy conveyed move and shift to moments of shared joyed..milestones in Jacks development...he rolls over, dad trains him to walk, that first word, that first picnic and exploring the world..  Love and joy and family togetherness... and it seemed the dad was always there...for everything... I wondered how he made a living and still ...had so much time to be present for his family.. Could it have been the family meant more to him then?? and somehow, with the advances and changes in the world...come to mean less and less....or his place in the family somehow came to mean...less and less.... I don't know..but it seems, as the family starts to grow, and sons number two and three come along... the story starts to shift. Dad starts to show evidence of.....friction..fracture...there are cracks that emerge in the seams. The quality time is less and less and the purity gives way to abrasion. It happens ever so slowely. Mom stays the same...she does not really seem to grow, develop or change. Her role of nuturer, consoler, keeper of the hearth remains. But any change in the interaction between dad, the boys and her is best seen in the change that comes over the father and his desire to make his way in the world, provide for the family, and adapt to the ever changing economics of the day..  dad seems to be involved in helping his neighbors, he seems to have a compassionate heart for the less fortunate. There is even a black family inserted into the middle of the movie. It seems to they are there to illustrate the comparison and contrast to the black mans' struggle and how that struggle affected him too.
That was how I saw it.. This friction that started to emerge affected the whole family. Mom reacted to dad's explosive overbearing and lashed out right back, in fierce protection of jack when dad got seriously punitive toward everyone.... Then there's that piano playing ...When the dad went to play the piano after the moma told the dad how the teacher liked jacks' book report..it seemed to me..oh oh... how can he be jealous of his own son? But that was real and human,,,..parents are people too.. with good emotions and the negative ones... and if we are lucky...we learn early how to navigate them.. we learn how to duck...Dad starts to gamble...another indication that there is trouble in paradise...was he losing his place..in the work place?? in the world??? did they need money? or did he have to win at something? didn't seem like he was losing... in those days...the main thing was never to let yourself show... the image always had to bethe best..putting your best foot forward... any sign of weakness let others have an advantage over you...as it was in the world and so it was in the  family...and microcosm..as above..so below.. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie ....thank you for your creativity, love and insight

4301554,5,B004A8ZX32,"I was surprised that so many people disliked this film. I find it incredibly profound, insightful, and beautiful. It is fundamentally about how we wrestle inside ourselves and negotiate between self-seeking, controlling behavior and a frame-of-mind more outward-seeking and joyful despite external circumstances. Many who live in the former mind-space can't comprehend the happiness and sense of well-being we can experience when we shift into the latter mind-set. If you found no meaning in the film, I encourage you to pay more attention to your own self-talk and behavior. How do you meet challenges? How do you react to others? What attitudes do you have toward yourself and others? In these moments, pay attention to how and when you feel peace and light and love, and when you don't. And adjust yourself toward those things. It requires work and effort. Regardless of what you believe, if you work toward this, you will start to see fundamental truths in this film and the film will become incredibly meaningful and moving.",1431043200,,1029,5.094674556213017

4301571,5,B004A8ZX32,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Tree of Life""

1. This is a Terrence Malik movie. Those that know who Terrence Malik are know what I'm talking about. In fact, this is probably the most Terrence Malick-y of all his movies.

2. The characters speak cryptically and in whispers. Make sure you have your subtitles on.

3. If you miss the beginning lines of what the nuns taught, you miss one of the main themes of the movie.

4. The movie blurs the line between parents and God -  they can all be glorious, hypocritical, and abusive.

5. There is a suggestion at the beginning of the DVD to turn the volume up loud. Take that advice.

6.  Some people say they don't understand the movie. But there comes a time in everyone's life (which may be a different time for everybody) where if you don't understand this movie, then you're either not paying attention, or you're lying to yourself.

7. Much of the movie is narrated in the first person. Malick once stated that he hoped that the viewer is able to understand that the story is their own - not that of the character in the movie.

8. The movie is about childhood, in all it's horrific glory. And it's about God, in all It's glorified horror.

9. This movie is a work of art from the opening frame to the ending frame. It's one of  the most intimately epic movies ever made. You just might hate it.",1429401600,6,1344,4.353413654618474

I'm sorry for this slightly off topic rant......but I love it when people get it right.

The film itself was quite different and I was taken for a ride which I found rewarding. Comments about having angry viewers tearing their hair out.....Lol......it reminds me of seeing 2001 Space Odyssey when it first was shown at theaters. About 20% of the audience huff and puffed out of the screening.

I don't think the film is the next ""Third Man"" or ""Citizen Kane"", but I think it's worth watching. If any of you don't quite understand this little review, I would encourage you to read a few books and listen to some music that isn't mind numbing popular fare.",1427500800,,942,4.987261146496815

Just about 30 minutes in, I legitimately though my dog had stepped on the remote and changed the channel to National Geographic. It basically felt like the director had found a bunch of beautiful space/biological/nature videos and wanted to fit them all into a story so he made a vague plot about growing up, evolution etc to try make it seem ""thought provoking"". Instead you get an absolute drag of a film that just goes on and on. It also seems like the director knew there wasn't much of a FILM here so he tried to sell it with have big actors like Brad Pitt and Sean Penn in it. Unfortunately I will never get those 2 hours of my life back. If you want a movie that actually has a plot, is even remotely entertaining, or is actually ABOUT SOMETHING, do not watch this movie.

4301640,4,B004A8ZX32,"Very heady 1950's family drama interspersed with long periods of random shots of the universe zooming out and flowers blowing. Do you remember the segment from the beginning of Men in Black 1? Where the camera zooms out of a town to the earth to the galaxy to the nebulas to a marble on some alien board game? This movie is basically 20 minutes of tense 1950's melodrama in an extremely patriarchal family where the father (Brad Pitt) rules over him family with an iron fist; then 20 minutes of shots of outer space and flowers blooming. So very micro to very macro over and over again. Similar to the movie Where the a Wild Things Are this movie depicts the family unit in a very raw, dysfunctional, way. One uniting thread is an absolutely incredible soundtrack. This has to be one of the best original movie scores I have ever heard.

In short, this movie isn't paced typically so if you sit down to watch a standard action movie it will seem strange. Set pieces can be loosely connected but if you go in with the right attitude it is very good.",1423785600,,1048,4.430051813471502
4301651,3,B004A8ZX32,"When all the bright lights gratuitously point to Pitt it falls apart completely.  Malick makes some great points here. He is strongest examining intimacy of childhood. A puddle in the street and cameras following children around corners while they run and play in their secret spots say more than all the hours of Boyhood.  Malick uses the RED cameras to remind us of the intensity and truth of simple blades of grass when seen through a child's eye. Scenes where some nostalgic props come into play are probably the least interesting and most distracting.  Malick's occasional nods to Kubrick would have been more effective had they been balanced by using a bit of Kubrick's great device: like Hitchcock, let the audience do the work by keeping it simple and never sentimental, which Malick does here, just not enough.",1423612800,,819,4.920289855072464

4301654,4,B004A8ZX32,"I've been going through a lot of firsts lately, and this is the first Terrence Malick film I've seen so far. Prior to this, I've only known about his visual style that includes a freely wandering camera and a tendency to emphasize visuals over story. So, with that in mind what did I think of this? Well, to be sure it is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. There's also a heavily spiritual undercurrent that makes every line and image pregnant with meaning, as long as you're willing to look for it. This is a very esoteric and philosophically dense film, and also very opaque in terms of what it means. There are a number of threads and themes which I was able to pick out, but I challenge anyone to really give a definitive interpretation. The basic story is about a family in 1950's Texas. There's the mother and father, played by Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain, and their three boys. The mother and father are fairly opposite in personality and approach to parenting, and this has a significant effect on their oldest son. One major theme that kept coming up was that of tragedy and how we respond to it. What the film seemed to be saying is that tragedy comes to us all, but what matters is how we deal with it. The film also deals with issues of childhood, growing up and the parent-child relationship. It also deals with life and love in a very broad, spiritual manner. I'm still trying to piece it together, but I must say that I liked it more than I thought I would. Terrence Malick is a filmmaker whose filmography I look forward to delving deeper into. This first look at the way he artfully combines images and music was very impressive. I also loved the soundtrack and score, composed almost exclusively of classical music. Some might find this type of film too arty or pretentious, but I was ok with it. That being said, one does have to have a measure of patience to watch this kind of film, and also not mind having little spelled out in terms of narrative or interpretation. If you're fine with that, then I heartily recommend this.",1420848000,2,2062,4.472148541114058
4301655,5,B004A8ZX32,"I honestly don't even know where to begin. The Tree of Life is one of only a very few films that have ever resonated this deeply with me. Its the kind of film that I think about for hours and days after viewing it. Its the kind of film that makes me wonder how much Ill be able to appreciate other films anymore after seeing it. Its the kind of film that, even though its about as far as you can get from an action movie, is every bit as engaging to me. And its the kind of film that once again reminds me just how powerful this medium is.

The complexity of The Tree of Life begins with its simplicity. Its resonance lies in the fact that it deals with emotions and feelings that every human has dealt with at one time or another. Some more than others, but it asks the questions weve all faced. Where are you God, when there is pain and suffering? Why do you let this happen? And paralleling the Old Testament book of Job, director/writer Terrence Malick poetically, beautifully, shows us Gods reply. But the way he tells the story is incredibly breathtaking. Going back to a simple Texas family, we watch three boys grow up with a rigid and strict father, and a good and loving mother. The film centers on the eldest boy, Jack, as he begins to face the reality of life and as he struggles with those questions.

The imagery and depth in The Tree of Life is more thoughtful than most any other film Ive seen. The score is gorgeous, and every moment of the film is perfectly acted and brilliantly crafted. It takes great acting to bring a script like this to life, and from the famous celebrated actors like Sean Penn and Brad Pitt to the debut roles of the boys, Hunter McCracken, Laramie Eppler, and Tye Sheridan, they all do a phenomenal job.

Granted, there will most certainly be many people who won't like this film. And there are quite likely people who won't connect strongly with it, but I wouldnt know, because it ticks perfectly in my mind. Its difficult to review a film like this that I connect to so strongly emotionally. I have a hard time bringing those feelings to words and would much rather go watch the film again (and again) rather than talk about it.

If you haven't seen The Tree of Life, youve been missing out. Give it some time. If you don't get it the first time, think about it, and at least give it another viewing.

Personally, I wish I could give it more than five stars.",1420675200,5,2403,4.331111111111111

4301682,5,B004A8ZX32,"Malick demands from his audience. He demands your patience, your observation and your thoughtful consideration. He also expects some minimal familiarity with the Biblical story of Job. Given those investments, ""The Tree Of Life"" returns an abundance of wonder, truth, love and finally security. These four elements of meaning according to Ravi Zacharias, are on display here as a divine response to the challenge of loss and suffering.
Not everything works perfectly in this film, and it does have one weakly executed segment. Still, this film is a masterpiece. Pitt's performance is very strong with a well-crafted rendition of the type of masculinity that returning veterans from World War II believed to be essential. It is a complex character, and Pitt shows his acting strength in fully developing the role. Jessica Chastain embodies the child's eye view of an angelic mother. The character could easily have been flattened since it presented as a memory piece from the view of an adoring son. Instead, her warmth and strength fills the role and draws us in to the central mystery of love and loss that drives the film.

The technical aspects of filmmaking are at the highest level here. A minor crime was committed when this movie was passed over for the Academy Awards for cinematography and directing. This movie should be watched in Blu-ray, on a large screen, in a dark room and with the sound turned up loud to capture all the filmmaker is offering.

The movie is thought provoking, however, one keeps trying to figure out the plot. A very abstruse movie that leaves you wishing you hadn't wasted your time watching it. It is not a happy movie. It is about taking the path of nature or grace. The movie starts with the earth being created and this goes on for 30 minutes and it is boring. The characters do a good job of acting considering the story plot. Brad Pitt is good and Sean Penn is seen little and I don't remember if he ever said a word, because he is the grown-up son in the movie with flash backs of the past. I guess this movie was given some acclaim at the Cannes film festival, but they tend to like deep, outlandish, off-the-wall and bizarre movies.

4301896,5,B004A8ZX32,"In this wonderful and strange film, director Terence Malick who produced 'The Thin Red Line' explores the life of a Texan family in the grand context of cosmic and geological history.

The film's plot revolves around the story of a small, traditional American middle-class family living in the 1950's,  made of a middle class husband (Brad Pitt) and wife (Jessica Chastain) and their three children.  The story is not linear but rather tells the story using flashbacks, narrative sequences and evocative scenes set to hauntingly beautiful music.  This technique is combined with images of the 'cosmic' story that place the events of the lives of the characters in a universal framework.  This is surprisingly well-done, from the scenes of the formation of the Earth and the solar system, to the death of the Earth billions of years into the future.

The film also engages with many deeper metaphysical, philosophical and religious/spiritual themes, such as the problem of suffering and evil, the meaning of life, the tragic nature of existence, the beauty and power of nature, the darkness of human sin and sinfulness, the nature of divine providence and personal freedom, and the movement of grace through cosmic and personal history.

The most wonderful aspect of the movie in my view are not the characters, scenes or images (though these are beautifully done) but rather the music.  This film is one of the most musical I have seen, along with '2001' and 'A Clockwork Orange.'  The music seems to be able to tell the story Malick is getting at far better than any images, from the 'Lacrimosa' sequence as we soar through spiral galaxies, nebula and stars to the uplifting tones of the rather abstract ending.

The film is open-ended but the message of the film seems to be an answer to the prayer given by one of the characters early on to God - 'What are we to you?"" and the answer is despite all the pain, tragedy, suffering and meaninglessness of human existence in the face of an infinite universe, at the end of time we will somehow understand how God's primary 'acts' in creation (nature and grace) work together in harmony to achieve their final goal.  It is strongly implied the precise nature of that final goal is beyond our understanding, but is a mystery we will perhaps understand from a God who is a 'strange island, unknown to humans and angels, even in heaven, only not to himself' (to borrow a phrase from St John of the Cross) in the realms of eternity.

A beautiful and thought-provoking film in any case.",1407888000,4,2528,4.799539170506913

4301899,5,B004A8ZX32,"Few movies dare ask the fundamental questions of existence, of religion. Tree of Life does, and entertains, filled with amazing cinematography, original music that conjures creation and battles of good and evil, and subtle acting that lets you figure out rather than feel preached to.  Starting with a quote from Job, ""Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?"" the film explores the existence of suffering, birth and death over the eons. The opening lines of Tree say 'There are two paths to follow, the way of grace or the way of nature, you have to choose which one to follow.'  Told within a family where mom (Jessica Chaltain) follows  grace, and dad (Brad Pitt) nature. The story develops through the eyes of their oldest son, played as an adult by Sean Penn, as he struggles to find his own balance between the compassion of grace and the selfishness of raw nature.  There are 3 sons, and the middle, favored one does, leading to a deep exploration of god....with questions like, ""God, who am I to you?.... Lord when did you touch my heart?... Are You watching me? ""

What gives this film by Terrence Malick the feel of a classic is the details. The oldest son, the most troubled, looks like neither parent. The middle son looks like Dad and the youngest like Mom.  Their interactions reflect the favoritism of Dad's raw approach to life, wanting to help, but ending up unfeeling, even cruel.  When the boys are young a boy dies in a pool, leading one to ask god, ""Are you watching me? I want to know what you are. I want to see what you see. Was he bad? (The boy who died in the pool.) Why should I be here if he isn't?""  After this death the oldest son becomes a delinquent, ultimately shooting a brother in the finger with his BB gun, causing great pain.... which leads to compassion and the beginning of a real internal struggle between grace and raw nature, along with the god question, ""What was it you showed me?"" and the understanding that ""Father, always you wrestle inside me.""  And finally, the warm words, ""The only way to be happy is to love. Unless you love, you life will flash by.... Keep us, guide us, to the end of time"" All told to music from the gods, by Alexander Desplat.",1406851200,8,2214,4.487562189054726

4301933,3,B004A8ZX32,"""Tree of Life"" is a deeply moving and emotional journey with a 50's era Texas clan as seen by the inhabitants of a family dominated by an unwavering and totalitarian father (Brad Pitt in a composed and unsympathetic role).  However, the movie's other major component is an experimental and meandering visual effects bonanza that equates the growing pains of a family to the birth and death of the planet Earth (and other related cosmic and natural wildlife adventures thrown in for good measure).  40 minutes of the movie is devoted to wordless but visually stunning special effects vignettes that do absolutely nothing to advance the story.

I've never witnessed a movie so direly in need of a 35-40 minute excision in my life. While Director Malick markedly excels in his ability to portray the happiness, anger, angst, and family dynamics- and gives us the space and time to emotionally connect with the O'Brien family, his blatant attempt at aping Stanley Kubrick's 2001 is a terrible and potentially fatal cinematic misfire.

Without the excessive atmospherics at the beginning and end of Tree of Life, the large midsection is a wonderful and moving portrait of a troubled family, extremely well acted by Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, and the young men who play their sons.  We see their limited joy and abundant pain through the eyes of the children and the long suffering wife.  Sean Penn, as one of the grown children in a thankless and virtually wordless role, staggers around downtown Houston and other scenic locales like a distraught, disoriented marionette.

Perhaps I lack the intelligence necessary to understand Malick's artistic vision.  Or maybe Malick didn't trust his own storytelling strengths and instead went art-house in a vain attempt to elicit critical kudos and make an important ""statement"".  In taking that approach he darn near ruined a promising movie.",1406419200,,1882,5.1042345276872965

4301936,5,B004A8ZX32,"Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life is a lyrical masterpiece.  It is also the most audacious meditation on grace, suffering and human nature that I have ever seen.  The sweep of ideas and the sincerity and honesty with which Malick presents the redemptive power of love, would, in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, come off as pretentious and self-absorbed (as many critics have accused Malick of being).  But far from pretentious and self-absorbed, I found Malick's film to be heartfelt, thoughtful, humble, and true.  This is art, and high art at that.

The film is not told in a traditional narrative form, and is therefore not an easy movie for some people to follow.  If you are having trouble understanding the film, then I would suggest reading the book of Job in which God addresses Job's frustration over his unwarranted suffering by showing him all his creation, including things Job has never seen or heard of (that's a lot of what that 20 minute ""cosmos"" sequence is all about).  But the film is also, I believe, a reflection on the tension between the ethical world of humans (the tree of knowledge of good and evil) and the natural world (the tree of life) in which our ethical efforts cannot in the end stave off the seemingly indifferent power of life itself.  At any rate, the effort it takes to unpack the symbols, the visual poetry, is infinitely rewarding.

It is a deeply spiritual film, and I have read that Malick is a Christian (I should note, however, that the level of his commitment to Christianity is unclear-like so many other things about the man), but he also has a serious background in philosophy, having studied with Stanley Cavell at Harvard.  He even published a translation of Heidegger's The Essence of Reasons.  With that in mind, I see this film as a modern version of the old medieval contemplative tradition of Augustine or Thomas Aquinas.  One could only imagine what those two might have produced if they had studied, as Malick has, Heidegger and William James.

I think it is perfectly fair to critique the theology here, but to call this film a ""mess,"" as some critics have, is an admission that the critic hasn't really been paying attention.  Malick does not insult our intelligence by explaining things.  He is a poet.  The best poetry employs images in novel ways in order to shake our consciousness, disturb it, and force it to play with new possibilities of being.  In this regard, ""The Tree of Life"" is a resounding success.",1405900800,25,2475,4.731934731934732

4301939,5,B004A8ZX32,"""The Tree of Life""  is a powerful film, not a few hours' escapism, that much was evident from the trailer.  This is not cowardly, safe film-making, but a work of potency and intuition and creative flow, so it probably has the flaws and imperfections that such work always has, but honestly, I was so completely mesmerized by it's depth and beauty and heart-to-heart quality of communication, that I couldn't notice the flaws.

The ""story"" centers around a husband, wife, and their three boys. Imagery flows dreamlike across the screen, often only making ""sense"" in the manner of dreams and at the level of intuition.  The film's classical score often creates an achingly lovely sense of cosmic meaning and vastness in the intimate, daily scenes of a family's life.  Dialogue is used sparingly to create deeper layers of meaning, not conversation.  The cinematography is undeniably sublime, and one could watch this film simply for the beauty of the visual experience.  This isn't a narrative film in the traditional sense.  Scenes and images sometimes flash across the screen so fast one can't register them before they're gone.  There's no real beginning, middle, and conclusion to this story.  I'm not sure there's quite a story.  In fact, it's best to simply experience ""The Tree of Life"" without trying too hard to figure it out.  Rather like Life, come to think of it.

Virtually all of Malick's films are great films and THE TREE OF LIFE fares no differently.  Set in the not too distant past it views family dynamics under a microscope where the male is the family breadwinner and the female is the nurturer-homemaker.  That the family consists of Dad, Mom and two sons is no accident.  Sons notoriously rebel at some point against their learned authority figure, Dad, and here we witness the oldest son transforming form child into man.  Dad's authority is challenged by the oldest son especially after the Mom questions some of Dad's choices and is psychologically demeaned as well as physically threatened.

4302043,5,B004A8ZX32,"Appealing to my own experience--I wanted to study film in school because I love films, but as college tends to open different vistas I wound-up studying philosophy. So, Mallick appeals to two of my most varying and challenging interests.

'Tree of Life,' is moody for certain. That is to say, this is perhaps not a film to watch if you are indifferent about your day. The viewer must engage and be engaged. The film will extract some energy from the viewer. Were I one who was chronically depressed, I think, this film could be devastating or comforting to the degree that one has already thought upon the themes of the film.

With that said, I plan to purchase this film for my own film library--I never know when the proper mood may strike me.

4302046,5,B004A8ZX32,"The Tree of Life is an amazing movie, a very personal one, and haunting for me.  It appears to me from seeing many reviews that people are VERY divided on whether they love or hate it, and I think perhaps it has to do with relevance to many people and their experiences in life.  In my interpretation of it, it was: 1.  Here is the universe and here is earth; 2. Here is one family on earth; 3. Here is their story, dysfunctional with bouts of love and pain; intertwined with nature; 4. Here is their peace through forgiveness, perhaps in some sort of heaven.  The movie seems as though it is one part nature and history documentary, one part sociology study, one part psychology study, and one part musical (without singing).  It's like ""The Squid & The Whale"" meets the documentary ""Life"" and then takes components from ""Baraka"" and blends together.  Ultimately though as they say in the bonus feature, it's very difficult to pinpoint describe the movie.

I originally impulse-bought The Tree of Life, watched it, was frankly so troubled by where it brought me back to emotionally that I gave it away, and have since bought it again to experience it again.  Having come from a strict childhood with very strict rules, it was extremely unnerving to me the first time I watched this, it felt like I was watching at times an autobiographical movie on my family.  Director Terrence Malick and particularly Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain in their roles NAIL some of the very minute nuances that families experience with a parent who is overly-strict at times, making everyone walk on eggshells.  There were times I found that to my amazement, as a guy in his 30's, there were tears coming down from my eyes.  Such moments were very difficult to watch, with the family dynamics portrayed in the movie.

And ultimately the movie had an ending of forgiveness, which is what haunted me the first time watching it.  I love my parents, both in my own way, but seeing how the movie ended was confusing to me and something I have pondered a bit, just because of my own past experiences.

The movie seems like a very personal one to Malick.  It is not a traditional movie and it is a very unusual cinematic journey, but I feel like the bad reaction to this movie is overblown, with people who don't like it assuming it is a BAD movie because they don't like it.  Perhaps it is more that The Tree of Life does not appeal to such people because they did not have experiences in their life in which they could relate to it, which doesn't mean I think they are not entitled to their opinions if that is the case.

With the movie ""trance""-type scenes, it blows you away with the operatic music and visuals.  Malick does seem like a poet, someone who fuses different senses with a cinematic experience.  You are transported to the world he is showing, into the tale he is telling, and however it affects you, if you just `be,' if you just `are' with it, it is quite an intense experience.

You get the strong snapshots of memories and then present day.  Of happy children playing during the summer and then a man trapped in his job, imprisoned by walls he bumps into as he says, where he has lost his connection to nature by being so trapped.  The movie includes such portions that do make you question your job if you may have one where you yearn for the ocean or trees but feel stuck in an 8-to-5er.  The movie fuses emotions with nature often and well.

You do get the voice overs and then music with vast 'universescapes,' where questions of faith are presented, with perhaps the universe as the backdrop showing our world and life's place amongst an eternity.  A cosmic explosion occurs, then a ""mere"" volcano on earth erupts with a vast landscape.  Scenes, visions of earth, caves, waterfalls, streams, cells, jellyfish, life growing, from green plants to dinosaurs proceed to transfix your mind and imagination.  Perhaps this is intended to show perspective, maybe connectivity, maybe both.  I don't know, but it works is what I do know.  An amazing flow of life.

You get the feeling there is not a single sound or visual that isn't entirely meant to be there, from the footsteps on a floor to the birds outside.  From a quiet backdrop of music to the pounding voices of singing that sound almost as if from angels.  From the sun through the trees to a massive flow of a waterfall.  With the definite fusion of faith and nature, you get the sense if Malick could he would encourage you to be outside when watching this to also be able to smell the natural air, to touch and feel blades of grass or bark of a tree, to even taste something from the settings he creates, all so you can be fully encompassed, fully present into the experience.  Not too many movies have I seen where I felt that.

Bottom-line: I thought it was a very poetic, beautiful, sad, and ultimately hopeful journey of a movie, and well-worth watching at least once to make sure you like it before buying.",1395187200,,4964,4.53932584269663
4302047,3,B004A8ZX32,"Terrence Malick's THE TREE OF LIFE is an attempt to inject some cosmic wonder into the most mundane American story.

In the 1950s, two parents bring up three boys in an American white middle-class, small-town existence. The mother (Jessica Chastain) radiates love and warmth, while the father (Brad Pitt) feels the obligation to be cold and distant in order to prepare his sons for the cruel world that awaits them. As we are informed at the beginning of the film, sometime during this mid-century upbringing, one of the boys would eventually die. We are also shown flashfowards to the present day, when the eldest son Jack, now a successful architect working in New York City, reflects on the death of his brother decades ago. There is very little conventional spoken dialogue in this family drama. The story is told through voiceovers on top of a rich series of images, these monologues representing the inner thoughts, doubts and fears of the characters.

But Malick adds something on top of this, one of the most controversial turns in Hollywood filmmaking in recent years. Early on we are treated to a depiction of the creation of the universe and of life on Earth, from the initial clouds of gas right after the Big Bang to small nebulae, then big galaxies like our own Milky Way, the Earth as an inchoate ball of lava, life arising in tidepools, and then into the era of the dinosaurs. These special effects were created by Douglas Trumbull, best known for the cosmic visuals of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The titles of the film quote from the Book of Job: ""Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth, when the morning stars sang together?""

I get what Malick is trying to do here, that is, to show that the trials and tribulations of an individual human life are part of some vast unknown plan. Nonetheless, while I can understand this on an intellectual level, the film does not seem to reconcile the two layers into a single coherent plot. The film is indeed a visual feast on a first viewing (the Bluray release watched on a project is nearly as stunning as 2001), but the TREE OF LIFE is much harder to sit through on a repeat viewing when one knows that it doesn't quite hang together. Furthermore, as thought-provoking as the story of the boys' 1950s upbringing is, the last part with its scenes of petty delinquency goes on forever and should have been cut. Finally, the ending which I won't spoil here is a total trope, not at all a fresh take on the meaning of life.

At a time when Hollywood is widely regarded as stagnant, I can appreciate a director like Malick who seeks to do something unexpected, but I find THE TREE OF LIFE to be rather a noble failure.",1395187200,3,2685,4.5875

I desperately wanted to be knocked out by the possibility of what this film could have been about but I walked out of the theater absolutely puzzled by what I had just watched. That creation sequence (which is the sole reason to recommend watching this) is stunning but was perplexing as to where it fitted in the ""Grace"" or ""Nature"" theme of the film. Is it suggesting (like the Prodical Son) those who donnot embrace ""Grace"" are all hopelessly devoid of any value or morality? Just from the opening narration I knew what side this film leaned in favor of. I donnot mind a little mental work out while watching a film---I eagerly look forward to it, but Tree of Life seemed to have no center or identiful theme to cling to and now appears to be  nothing more than a series of scenes that have no greater point or purpose. It is as if one was given a family photo album and turning the pages and looking at the images but knowing nothing about the people or the story behind the photo. You might respond on a very primal and basic human level to those images but nothing much more than that.

I wish I can recall where I read that Tree of Life was a ""science fiction"" film. Perhaps I misread it, but it would have at least had some vague structure. From this piece of misinformation and the images from the trailer I thought the earth was destroyed by some event and perhaps we began to colonize another planet and these images were the memories of the Sean Penn character. The ultimate question being: What do want to carry to another world. Will we be able to shred ourselves of the negative aspects and redefine what is human in us as we are exiles front our mother planet.  The film as it is is an interesting failure.

There were once several directors who yearned to make no less than a masterpiece, but now there are only a few. Malick has stayed true to that hope ever since his first feature in 1973.""- Roger Ebert.

2012, Roger Ebert called the film one of the 10 greatest films of all time in Sight & Sound's poll in 2012. I recommend the review on his website.

But the overly rational person of little soul who takes great care to walk straight will probably not appreciate such a poetic and mystical vision of the life and universe where nature is cruel but grace is devine. Such extravagant grace (is there any other kind?), the big bang, a primeval soup, ages and eons roll, and all this merely to focus on a simple family of flawed characters in a country setting in rural small time America. Such a short two and a half hour film to tell a story which begins and ends in eternity. And the moral is explicit: those without love in life are damned to having it all race by far too fast.

4302147,3,B004A8ZX32,"This movie tells the tale of a 40-something man who is reflecting back upon his childhood growing up in the south under the care of a very sweet, soft, loving mother and a very hard, demanding, authoritarian father. Over the course of the movie we observe how he eventually comes to terms (sort of) with his conflicting feelings toward his father. The plot-line is a good one, the story is told very sensitively, the actors are wonderful in all their roles. I found myself identifying very closely with the main character because my own parents were very much like his, and I (like the main character) was much more like my father in personality than my mother, but despite this I often found myself feeling intense hatred toward my father for his harsh parenting practices. The movie had me in tears here and there, and I don't cry easily. I would normally give a movie like this 5 stars. HOWEVER - interspersed throughout this movie are long, drawn-out scenes of what I can only conclulde were intended to be representative of mystical imaginings. You are shown lots of clouds, sunshine shots, numerous beach scenes featuring many familiar characters, some of whom you know are no longer alive and/or no longer that age. Perhaps these are intended to depict heaven, or some kind of after-life? Or perhaps the main character's dreams? I am really not sure, it's not really explained, you are simply left to figure that all out for yourself. Yeah, seriously. And yes, at one point (as several others have mentioned) there was even a dinosaur scene. Don't ask me what the point of that scene was, I'm still scratching my head about it. Apparently the director felt these scenes would cause the audience to feel connected/one with the universe, or some such nonsense. Suffice to say that for the vast majority of level-head folks, these ""mystical/spiritual scenes"" do NOT succeed in their apparently-intended purpose, and only serve to detract from what would otherwise be a wonderful coming of age story. Not to mention they add a good 30-40 minutes to what already would have been a rather lengthy film. The net result is a move that is well over 2 hours long! I hope that explains why many viewers either love or hate this movie. The main plot-line is wonderful, sensitive and beautifully acted, but those extraneous ""spiritual"" scenes are a real downer - at least for me they were (and clearly for many others). That's why I give this movie only 3 stars. With those edited out, it would have been a 5 star movie. I don't recommend against the movie - I would recommend watching it, though, either on a DVD or via an on-demand service.

Tree of Life is primarily an ""impressionist"" experience: things don't ""make sense"" in a linear narrative way. This can be annoying and frustrating for those who like traditional stories, which is most of us. But I'm fine with a difficult-to-watch movie if there's a payoff. For me, there was no payoff. I found the film to be too self-conscious of its attempt to be ""deep."" It's said that acting is bad when you ""sense the actor acting."" In this film, I sensed the director directing. I also found most of the ""deep"" elements to be trite. eg The existential whispering voice-overs reminded me more of a Saturday Night Live skit than a serious inquiry into spirituality or philosophy. And the recurring images of trees and the flickering light were heavy-handed and goofy, as was the scene where the characters from past and present united.

OK, so the movie didn't succeed for me, but there were positives. The cinematography was beautiful, prompting some to call it a two-hour screensaver, which I found amusing. The acting was pretty good, too, especially the child actors. And I thought the depiction of the family dynamic was well done. Also, there's value in filmmakers pushing the boundaries of the medium and making the audience work a little. Future filmmakers will surely be influenced by this movie and incorporate some of its interesting elements into their films.

4302279,4,B004A8ZX32,"This movie notoriously divides movie-lovers. I myself was pleasantly surprised by this movie, the first Malick-movie I saw. Indeed I do have reservations. Two long sequences contrasting and supplementing the main story feel poorly proportioned: too long, and too obvious.

It was quite a contrast to me:
On one side there is the main story taking place in the fifties, seen from the current-day perspective of the Sean Penn-character; a poetic stream of impressions, well edited (fast, suggestive), with good acting (quite natural), and supposedly superb directing.
This surely justifies seeing the whole movie! I think the main story (18 + 80 minutes) is unparallelled.
On the other side there is this long evolution-sequence (in the first third of the movie) and the final sequence (the resolution): here the feeling surfaces that scenes are (not off the mark in themselves but) too long, and the suggested happenings/messages are too obvious.
Maybe it is because Malick wanted `to make a point' (with the evolution-sequence) and because the final sequences supposedly were very personal and emotional/therapeutic for him, that he lost his otherwise good sense of proportion.

The whispered voice-overs did not disturb me; I found it interesting and mostly well-done.
Unfortanetely, the music was sometimes really over the top.

Themes:
mourning, wavering faith, and existential ambivalence about two basic attitudes in life:
an attitude of control and self-determination, and an attitude of acceptance and (self)sacrifice.
(bringing along with it the subthemes of alienation and love/redemption.)

The good and beautiful things in this movie certainly are stronger, to me, than the weaker things are weak.
One poster on the internet described it very aptly:
This is ""an interesting film with significant strengths alongside some fairly significant weaknesses.""

4302280,4,B004A8ZX32,"It only feels like an eon while watching this film.

Believe it or not, it took me over a year to get through this movie.  I am completely serious.  I recorded it on ""free"" TV, and I've watched bits and pieces where I've been able.  One year later, I finally watched the credits role.  And while I give this film a 4, those credits were as welcome as a cooked turkey on Thanksgiving.

This film shows the danger of making a film while smoking too much dope.  Naturally, I'm teasing a bit.  But holy cow; if you're going to make a film, is it really a smart idea to nearly require your audience to have a degree in psychology to just get through it?

I loved the way this film started, and I loved the cinematography.  The film seems to start out with the basic theme:  ""You cannot control your destiny.""  And that would be naturally a tautology, as ""destiny"" will be the things that will happen to you out of your control.  But then the film took an odd darker turn.

I've read quite a bit from Freud, and I've read quite a bit about true-crime as well, particularly serial killers and their motivations.  And from what I remember -- do not shoot the messenger, as I do not necessarily hold these same opinions myself -- Freud believed that young boys became homosexuals when they became too attached to their mothers.  That perspective became quite politically incorrect, and the perspective has changed over the years.

Supposedly now, it is believed that boys who don't spend enough time with their fathers -- and then become attached to their mothers -- later on learn to dislike their mothers as a nasty side effect.  Because of this, those boys become misogynistic, and take out their frustrations on other females later in life.  These types of males tend to become serial killers.  Once again, do not shoot the messenger.

Why is this important to the film?  Well, there is a sequence that obviously borrows from these ideas here.  One of the sons grows dark half way through, and he starts to commit some petty crimes and become ""mean"" at least.  And I thought that he might go darker than that.  While watching, I actually thought that the movie maybe should have been entitled, ""How Serial Killers are Born"" perhaps.

This film felt like three films to me; I liked the beginning, the middle went dark, and then the ending seemed to go completely off the rails.  But did I like it?

It depends upon what ""like"" means.  I think that, if you have an eon or so, this is worth a peek.  But you might just be scratching your head, just as I did while watching.",1384560000,,2565,4.47732181425486
4302301,5,B004A8ZX32,"I bought this disc used and like it enough that I will buy it again new for my library (my blu-ray disc freezes in a few spots).  If you are not sure about this film, it would help to have seen another of Terrence Malick's films, such as Days of Heaven. Yes, I agree that Tree of Life is pretentious, but that doesn't mean that you can not enjoy it.  First of all you must see it on high def on a big screen with a good sound system, otherwise, the visuals and music won't pull you into the non-narrative (I watched it on a projection screen).  I haven't seen anything this stunning since 2001: A Space Odyssey - if you didn't like or ""understand"" that film, you probably won't like this one.  Whereas 2001 is about the Tree of Knowledge - ape touches Tree, learns to use tools and kill, becomes man, goes into space, ascends into Heaven, ultimately transforming into the Messiah (at least that's my interpretation), The Tree of Life is all about Life, Death, the Creation of the Universe, the Wonders of the World, and Family.  No, I did not find it disrespectful of religion - I don't see why evolution can't be part of the Creator's process.

Those who like classical music will like the soundtrack - I couldn't get Smetana's ""Vltava"" out of my mind after watching this, and there is plenty of other wonderful music from the likes of Bach, Berlioz, Mahler, and Tavener.  One of the characters is a ""failed"" musician, and there are many references to classical music, such as a quote from Toscanini.

I find it laughable that one of the reviewers said that the only reason they gave it two stars is that Sean Penn is in it.  For me, Sean Penn's character is the weakest part of the film - whether it's the fault of the script or the performance, he does not emote enough for me to understand him - Most of the time, he just looks confused, like ""what am I doing in this film?"".  Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain, on the other hand, turn in fine performances - I truly believed they could be my Dad and Mom, or Husband or Wife.  My other major disappointment with the film is the ending.  I sort of ""understand"" it, but I expected something more visually breathtaking after all that passed before - perhaps all the characters should have danced in the air like (SPOILER ALERT)
Jessica Chastain did in front of the Tree - Oh, maybe that would have been too pretentious?

***Update***
After watching the film a second time, I felt the need for some updates. First, I would rate the Blu-ray image and sound quality as both 9/10. The movie was was primarily shot on 35mm film using natural lighting, so there is a bit of film grain noticeable on some scenes, but otherwise the picture is about as good as you are going to get from a 35mm source.  The soundtrack is at a fairly low level, so the blu-ray producers are right when they ask you to crank up the sound whenever you start up the disc.  I did turn up the volume for the second viewing, and it made for a better experience.  More of the often whispered dialog came through.  The surround channels are subtle, and the LFE channel only kicks in when appropriate.  All in all, a very natural sounding (not knock your socks off) soundtrack.

The second time around, I was able to better understand the structure of the film, and its spiritual aspect.  The Book of Job is quoted a few times, and after re-reading it, I can see where Terrence Malick found his inspiration.  (A few mild spoilers follow.)  In Job, a righteous man is tested by God, questioning his faith after a great loss.  A relevant quote from the Book of Job:
""Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God."" (37:14).
From this passage, and others in Job describing stars, constellations, Behemoth (""He lieth under the shady trees""), and Leviathan (sea monster), the non-narrative imagery in the film make much more sense.

A few more hints to understand the imagery:

Water: symbolic of life, birth, rebirth.
Dirt, sand, desert: symbolic of death, repentance.
Water+sand: life+death = afterlife.",1384560000,,4044,4.529573590096286

4302304,5,B004A8ZX32,"I was warned about THE TREE OF LIFE. Glad I was warned. If had had been expecting some sort of sweeping narrative flow or even not so engaging, I loved this film. Believe it or not, my thoughts seemed to go back at times to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. When I saw that film I simply fell into it, fell into the experience as I watched it and loved it and often return to it. There was no narrative flow to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. I hate to even call that film an experience. It was set some time in the future in space and there were simply images, sights and sounds. I never forgot those. THE TREE OF LIFE seems very similar in some respects. It seems to attract one on different levels of consciousness, existence or remembrance. There is cause and no cause and there is effect and that effect is not always clear or mainstream. Visually THE TREE OF LIFE is pensive, blunt, obscure. I found a lot of character in Sean Penn's face. I saw time, the passage of time.",1383177600,3,976,4.252688172043011
4302305,5,B004A8ZX32,"Predictably, reaction to this movie will be at either end of the spectrum. I am at the ecstatic end of that spectrum.
If I could make movies, I would use this one above all as my model.
What can be more profound than if you could reunite with your siblings, parents and even yourself when you are old but they and you are at the age they were when you were all just growing up in a Texas small town in the 50s?
This is the highly moving and symbolic scene with which the movie cathartically closes.
The magnificent cinematography, wonderful music and expressive facial expressions of the actors over which the camera lingers and captures in a way that the whole story is told nonverbally in almost every frame.
I love the camera angles.  The langurous pace of the movie, which jumps back in forth in time manages to fill out the characters and add psychological depth a more traditional script would not have.
Central to the movie is the troubled relationship spawned by the father's too authoritian manner towards the older son, and to a lesser extent towards his wonderful wife and other sons.
But he comes to grip with it in a way that expresses his remorse.
This is in the category of Remembrance of Things Past.
Our memories in many ways are the most alive components in our experiences in life, and constantly stimulate an inner struggle whose aim is to achieve resolution amidst the banality of our outer lives.",1383177600,,1418,4.582677165354331

I'm not looking to be distracted from life, I am looking to feel it more fully.  I like films and books that stretch me.  Five or ten minutes into this movie, I thought I was going to be one of those who got so bored they couldn't watch it.  I loved the images, but it hadn't penetrated inside me enough to hold me.  Later on I was thinking I could take my attention away to do something else, but in fact I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  The unfolding story had gotten into me, taken hold of me, and I was mesmerized by the beauty of what I was seeing and feeling.  I did pause it finally, but only because the intensity was too much for me--I needed to take a break and absorb it before going back.  After an hour or so I came back and finished it.

I didn't get that this was a story about a dysfunctional family.  What I saw was a man who loved his family--it came through in everything he did--but also had a lot of pressure to take care of them, which conflicted with his own dreams.  As he said, he never missed a day of work, he tithed every week.  Yet, things went awry.  His beliefs collided with reality.  I saw a woman, who exemplified the female philosophy, at a time--in the '50s--when women didn't carry the pressure of providing financially for a family.  Their job was to nurture the family, and she did a good job of it.  To me, this movie was about a functional family, one that loved through the dreams and the sorrows, and that was the triumph of life in the end.  Many have said: to know that love is all there is, is all there is to know.  I didn't mind the ""disjointed"" stuff, because that's the way thoughts are--that's the only story in this moment, there is no past or future--the past is gone and the future never comes. Just thoughts about it.  Thoughts can be changed, and thus everything can be healed in the present moment.

It is true that it is not very linear but there is a key to appreciating this work of art (and it is a work of art). Experience it. Observe. There is a grand scope to this film from the creation of the universe to the creation of life. The whole film feels like you're lying in water with your ears below the surface, eyes closed, remembering the past, and imagining origins you've never personally seen. You need to float through this movie and allow your conscious to see through the character's eyes. It is a roving perspective where the film tries to see through each character internally.

American cinema is going through a depraved period very similar to the 1950s. Back then, in order to compete with television, Hollywood produced numerous wide-screen, color, 3.5 hour, ""sword and sandal"" epics. They usually were not as good as films of the 1930s and 1940s. Today, cinema is exploiting CGI, special effects, and excessive Foley-art. I won't go to these ""roller-coaster"" movies. ""The Tree of Life"" uses special effects but very creatively and thoughtfully. It is an excellent example of what contemporary films can be, but typically are not! It can stand beside Spielberg's Lincoln film.",1377043200,3,741,4.983870967741935

Things that you are subjected to incessantly for the first 30 minutes of this film: random, fleeting images of stars, birds, landscapes, fish, amoebas, etc.; overblown operatic music that bears no relation to the meaningless images flitting across the screen; bits and pieces of anguished, whispered ruminations about nothing.
Here is what you know at the end of 30 minutes into this film: there is a family (maybe) that lives somewhere consisting of a father, mother, and two (or maybe three) children; one of the children seems to have died somewhere; the earth was created a long time ago amidst a lot of cosmic upheaval; dinosaurs lived on the earth a long time ago; Sean Penn lives in a big city somewhere and goes to work (maybe) and talks on a cell phone.

4302416,5,B004A8ZX32,"There's a good description of the film in the trailer, and the movie as whole does not contain much more dialogue.  The theme of the film is the struggle between nature and grace/love and the ultimate triumph of the latter.  Love triumphs because it links together all things, overcoming spatial and temporal connections and, ultimately, death.  The mother, who looks like she was modeled on a character in a Botticelli painting, represents love, the father nature.  The central event of the film, the death of a son at age 19, is never portrayed or explained. It cannot be explained, of course; yet, it belongs to nature, apparently, the realm of the rational. This is one of several failures of nature, failures that are shown here without explanations.  The father is a success engineer (yet he considers himself a failure); his son an architect.  The static straight lines of the products of their professions are juxtaposed with the flowing curves of sand and sea.  Ultimately, there is a kind of synthesis, a doorway separate from all else on a beach.  Here, the architect belongs to nature, but I think the point is that even his work, taken in the proper way, can be a doorway to eternity.  Though each stage of nature is transient, the whole is eternal and, thereby, pervaded with grace (love)--if we can but see it.  The film ends with a scene that again imitates a renaissance painting--the cast in positions on a beach--all together, all apart--in an eternal love.

Tree of Life insists on going grand, with its meditations on the creation and the morning of the first resurrection, yet holds just as fiercely to its naturalism--the mundane as not-so-mundane. The resulting juxtaposition, from the suggestion at the beginning of the DVD to play it at a loud volume, to it's deep passions and compassions, to its formal experimentation reminds me very much of James Agee's masterpiece, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.

The everyday struggles of Jack and his family ring true, as do the wisps of thoughts given under his breath throughout as soliloquies of the id, and later the enlightened human being. It is shocking to us and his to father when some of these mind-mutterings are spoken out loud.

Of course, being a made by Terrence Malick, Tree of Life it is lovely to look at, but that beauty serves to enlighten, enliven, and enlarge the soul. As Wallace Stevens urges, it does indeed ""speak humanly from the height [and] from the depth of human things"".",1373932800,4,1031,4.722222222222222

I was somewhat touched by the film... but I was bored. Plain and simple. I think this movie walked a fine line right on the border of ""total boredom"" and ""best movie ever."" Unfortunately, it fell into the ""total boredom"" category for me.

I think, personally, that this movie could have a learned a couple things from the movie Waterworld starring Kevin Costner. Waterworld was packed with action, suspense, romance, and even a couple 'o yucks. From the moment the Universal Studios Logo melts into the waterworld to the very last frame of the film, you will be on the edge of your seat. Waterworld holds a special place in the hearts of it's viewers across the world and most of them, like me, watch it every Saturday night (I assume).

In summary, The Tree of Life is not Waterworld. I think that is what people need to understand. If you watch this film you just need to keep that in mind.

Terrence Malick, at his best, is bewitching.  He casts a spell of deep calm.  This is true despite the opening suggestion for The Tree of Life (2011):  ""For optimal sound reproduction, the producers of this Blu-Ray recommend that you play it loud.""  Loud I did play it and they were quite in the right.  It is a terrific accomplishment of sight and sound.  It ought to have come with another warning:  ""For optimal viewing, the producers of this Blu-Ray recommend you see it big."" I have now seen all of Terrence Malick's movies and this is easily the most ambitious.  It's about life and death, the universe and our place in it, God and deep human emotion.  What else is there?  When you leave this movie, and this is mostly true of the other Malick movies, you walk out to the edge of a sharp cliff and you can see down, far below you lie all other movies.  They simply do not compete for ambition, maturity, thoughtfulness, and beauty.  It just feels like something completely different.

This is the story of a family.  In what looks to be the late 60's, Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) receives a telegram and finds out that one of her sons has been killed.  She and Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt) are hit hard by the loss.  In the present day, Jack (Sean Penn) is working as an architect in Dallas.  He is preoccupied with his past and contemplates life.  The universe is born, galaxies formed, planets emerge, and on Earth life is created.  Jack is born, brief moments of his early life go by, then his brothers are born and, in their young teenage years, the bulk of the story is told.  Mr. O'Brien is tough on his sons R.L. (Laramie Eppler) and Steve (Tye Sheridan), but on the eldest son, Jack (Hunter McCracken), he is too tough.  All of his own failings and troubles he takes out on Jack in the thought that he's getting him ready for life as he knows it to be.  As Jack grows older, he has difficulty dealing with his thoughts and emotions about his father, his mother, pain, God, loss, plus all the ordinary things a young boy has to deal with.

I think that the reason I never--but maybe once--thought about this movie being pretentious is that I basically ignore the voice overs.  They feel to me to be optional.  You can take a dip, listen in, but if you focus too hard, something else will pass you by.  That's what makes The Tree of Life such a great movie.  It's a beautiful film to watch (cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki) as it is to listen to its score (Alexandre Desplat) or soundtrack.  Let me underline that, the score and soundtrack is perfect.  The story is told as impressionistic.  You only get an impression from one shot, whether it's a tear on Jack's face or a piece of dialogue, which will only last a moment before it cuts to another shot that might be Jack coming home and Mrs. O'Brien responding to Jack's hugging or avoiding her.

Cut cut cut cut cut which keeps the energy of the film driving forward, developing your sense of the story and character.  A movie is a rapid substitution of one picture for another, slightly different picture that gives the illusion of motion.  That's how The Tree of Life operates.  It's a delightful thing if you can watch it without conscious thought.  I understand there are many of you out there--the sort that likes to guess the outcomes of mysteries, for example--that just can't find the dimmer on their brain to passively enjoy a movie.  This is how I watch most movies.  I turn down the lights and let the movie impress upon me.  I suspect that this is why I enjoy The Tree of Life and To the Wonder (2013) (review) so much.  When I can't turn it off or a movie isn't immersive enough to force it off, then it's going to be tough for me to enjoy.

The cosmic interlude, if you haven't seen the movie, may strike the cynical viewer--and I certainly sympathize--as pretention writ large.  Believe me when I tell you, it is astounding.  Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is supposed to have one redeeming quality in the beauty of his planetary waltz.  I'm having trouble finding words to describe how far it is surpassed by The Tree of Life.  Obviously, that movie is a technical marvel for the time--with roughly twice the budget of The Tree of Life when adjusted for inflation--but the imagination on display during Malick's sequence is unparalleled.  What makes it so great, and I think aloud here, is that it is still imbued with Malick's maturity and his eye, like he's capturing the moment without having planned it.  Just ""here it is.""

I was all set to say ""Take that Stanley Kubrick!  And that Steven Spielberg!""  But what begins as a major ass kicking of Jurassic Park (1993) by Malick's dinosaurs captured in the wild droops just enough for a moment to give Spielberg the win.  The movement was too smooth, the steps weirdly on the wrong vertical plane.  It is the first of two errors.  The second comes at the end of the film with Chastain cupping and uncapping of her hands against the sun.  Both moments broke the spell.  Up until then, Malick was nowhere to be seen or felt other than in my super-conscience, to give credit to when I felt something awesome.  Then, comes a repetition of movement in such quick succession that looked so much like a ""cool thing to do"" that I was a bit annoyed.

Otherwise the performances were very good.  Those boys were astoundingly good.  Tye Sheridan, you may not be aware, is the lead in Mud (2013) (review) where he was very good as well--obviously, he had a lot more dialogue in Mud.  Hunter McCracken is arguably the lead in this movie and he carries many scenes on his young shoulders.  The Tree of Life is something like a mid-point, dialogue-wise, between To the Wonder and a normal movie.  There are some scenes in The Tree of Life where you can hear full exchanges, but mostly it is impressionistic, non-explanatory voice-overs and never a full, conventionally constructed scene.  That makes it relatively difficult to judge performance levels.  Really, Sean Penn just lets his wrinkly face do his acting for him.  If, however, we accept the view that evoking a feeling is a sign of a good performance, then everyone did the best work of their lives.  Brad Pitt should possibly be given special special mention for, legitimately, giving the best performance of his career as a hard, frustrated, mostly unlikeable man.  I haven't seen Moneyball (2011) yet, but I find it hard to imagine that it was anything with as much depth or range as in this movie.

The Tree of Life was up for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography at the Academy Awards in 2012.  For Best Picture I can imagine that The Artist (2011) hit more heartstrings and faux-nostalgia to make it voter friendly, but Best Director (Michel Hazanavicius for The Artist) and Best Cinematography ( Robert Richardson for Hugo (2011)) are comically wrong.  I would have liked to have seen Jessica Chastain rewarded somewhere, but I suppose a nomination for The Help (2011) is something--something like a backhanded compliment, possibly.  Perhaps it's hypocrisy to complain that voters didn't watch one of the top three movies of the year when I hadn't seen it until just now, but I imagine that The Tree of Life didn't receive more accolades than it did because people couldn't be bothered to watch a movie they thought would be too artsy.  It isn't hard, it too artsy, it's just good, accessible modern art.

4302555,2,B004A8ZX32,"Tree of Life has moments of brilliance but the parts do not match the whole. Art such as film and books involve choices and Malick does not know when to let go. I hear he actually edits several hours into two to three so I guess he does feel he's editing out most of his material. Someone should tell him that unless he's making a miniseries, movies do not lend themselves to this kind of indulgence. You either have something to say or you don't. Some may feel that we have to think this one through. I personally feel it's overwritten (like The Thin Red Line). Too many unnecessary cryptic voiceovers. The floating camera captures beautiful movements but when it goes on and on it loses effectiveness and you start getting restless. Tree of Life had so much potential but lost it by being so pretentious. Choices, Malick, choices. You could have made two maybe three great films from these ideas instead of one meandering, long, boring one that does not add up to its ambitions.
 By the way, I am 52 years old and have seen it all. I am not one of those people who was brought up on action films of today. Slow is nice. The movie Witness had slow moments but was always intriguing. In the Bedroom is another example (though less so).

4302581,4,B004A8ZX32,"Tree of Life tells you in its title what to expect. It calls to mind one of those nature documentaries by Attenborough,as 20 minutes in we go back to the formation of the Earth,the fires of the sun,1st stirrings of life in cells in the sea,roaring waters,jelly fish. There are images in spate,whole Niagaras of them. In the rest of the film there are moments captured as if for the 1st time,a butterfly alighting upon Mrs O' Brien's hand,the glint of sunlight on the river or through trees,a touch,exultant running,a satin chemise. This is a memoir of his own childhood from the child's eye-view. Malik makes a mythology from Paradise,the Fall of Man and the Book of Job. Its main subject is a family of mother,father and 3 sons, life in suburban Waco,Texas. He assigns archetypal roles to mother(grace) and father(selfish,striving Nature).

The children's worship of their peacful,nurturing,pre-Raphaelite-like mother takes the form of an image of her floating,with a magical realism of light,dress,hair and balletic movement. We may be looking for a plot-line to hang the images on,what we receive is a great film-maker's search for material by capturing certain emotions and feelings of an America at the peak of its power through tracking shots through wind-waving grass,Vermeerish light through windows,whispered quasi-poetic narration,tree-canopies splintering the, sun,magic hour duskiness,beautifully shot by Lubezki.

Malik stays close to the boys(particular Hunter McCracken as discontented Jack and Laramie Eppler as doomed, favourite middle son R.L.).Jack's rebellion from his embittered(Pitt's)dad,a disappointed musician working for an oil company,whose severe strictness with everybody and hot temper drives a wedge through the household. We are drawn into a vortex of half-whispered,prayer-like questioning, coming from the adult Jack(Penn)in the present and and from the mother and father in the past. What worries me is the avoidance of drama(cf Bergman and Allen's versions)due to the evident talent of Malik celebrating what's precious about life,his place as the father of modern American film,re-enacting the fall of mankind from a Garden of Eden,situated in 50s suburban America.

He displays a gracious cinema of longing and regret. The end is grandiose,uniting all his present and past selves, dead and living loved ones,on a vast beach under a liturgical chorus,and considering the mystery of his own birth by returning to the primordial ooze. This feels clunkily over-symbolic. What remains like an implanted memory is the 1950s material making up the bulk of the running time staged with enthralling tactile and atmospheric detail. Chastain and Pitt are brilliant,the boys acting is superb. Malik's filming is like a chant of Homer's bard.

4302587,3,B004A8ZX32,"Having read a number of the reviews before and after viewing the film, I would just make a few comments that might add to the discussion. On the positive side, the cinematography was excellent in many respects, but more editing needed to be done to reduce the fatigue factor and make the apparent message more digestible. The more important aspect is the message itself.

I take it that the opening portion of the film sets the message as fundamentally spiritual in nature. The opening statement contrasting Nature and Grace is the basic premise, but the film itself barely expands on that very interesting and intriguing statement. Since the cultural setting is Christianity one would think that an understanding of Nature and Grace from a biblical point of view might be helpful. Biblically speaking, the existence of God is said to be apprehended by the mind through the creation itself so as to leave man without excuse (that which has design must have a Designer). The natural world is powerful evidence of the existence of God. Romans 1:19-20. The film does a fair job of setting out the wonder of the natural world, but it clearly supports evolutionary theory which the atheists claim renders a creator unnecessary. The opening verse at the beginning of the film should give all atheists and evolutionary scientists pause as the verse from Job points out that no man was there to actually observe how the universe was created. Science is supposed to be based on careful observation and experimentation therefore science cannot get beyond speculation and story telling as regards the initial creation of the universe and life itself.

But putting the evolution/creation debate aside, the definition of the word Nature is fairly close to the biblical view excepting that the biblical view takes Nature beyond simple moral terms. A person might by natural inclination and moral study develop what might be considered a gracious personality, but that is not biblical grace. Biblically speaking, because of the fall, man starts out as separated from God and thus subject to death. In fact man is, by nature ""dead in trespasses and sins"" Ephesians 2:1-3. Therefore he is a ""child by nature"" of the judgment of God. The ""natural man"" (unregenerate) cannot understand the revelation of God and he counts it as foolishness. 1 Corinthians 2:14. Finally, the natural world itself, as an effect of the fall, has been subjected to vanity Romans 8:19-21. We live in a fallen world and as a result we are subject to sin and death. Into this natural condition comes the real Grace of God.

In the film grace is defined as unselfish, forgiving and loving. Perhaps this is a going to far in the interpretation of the film, but the father of the family seems to be connected with the films definition of nature and the mother with the films definition of grace. The children seem to be torn between the two. Coming to terms with death is of course a major theme as well. All this touches on biblical themes but falls far short. Real Grace is unknown to the natural man because it comes from God's revelation of Himself in Christ and can only be known through redemption. A contemplation of Ephesians 2:1-10 makes all this clear. The book of Romans is a systematic presentation of this Grace of God.  All of mankind has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Man being created in the image of God, he was to be a display of this glory of God, but sin has ruined man and rendered him incapable, in his natural state, of being a reflection of God's glory. God who is love as well as light seeks mans recovery through the ""gospel of the grace of God."" His light exposes what we are as rebels and sinners, but His love brings in the way of recovery to Himself and the way into eternal life. The film depicts a kind of afterlife or heaven in a humanistic way but without the real Christian theme of redemption, reconciliation and resurrection to God. Perhaps the best thing about the film is that it might lead persons to reconsider the deeper message of the Bible. I hope this will add to the further discussion of the film.",1365638400,2,4113,4.716272600834492

4302639,5,B004A8ZX32,"This is much more than a ""movie"", it is truly a work of art - Terence Malik is just amazing; his vision is expansive and out of the box.  Many people don't like this film and some, like my husband, did not like it the first time because he hadn't understood it.  I took him home, read him the reviews, took him back a second time the same day, and he loved it.  We saw it numerous times after that before now buying it.

Many think it's about religion - it touches on religion and the connection between religion and god, but it is not, in my opinion, a religious movie.  Myself, I am very connected to things spiritual but do not go in for organized religion.  This movie actually made me feel some understanding of the Catholic religion, as the film begins with a simple theme that a woman learned as a little girl - there is nature and there is grace.  I believe this movie begins investigating how these two things fight each other, but winds up bringing them together.  After all, everything is one - this is physics as we now understand it.  Science can help you reach oneness easier than anything these days, and I feel that with the amazing Hubble shots of the universe Malik uses in this film help us ""feel"" the creation, the infinite, in a way beyond words.  I feel he accomplished that in this film!! That's how much I love it.

Yes, there is little dialogue, but I'll tell you that Brad Pitt has never, ever been better while saying less.  He really embodies this man - he looks like Brad Pitt, but he walks like his character, sets his jaw like him, and emanates from his very being a man who loves his family but feels frustrated in his career.  You can feel this split in Pitt's acting - his character is abusive at times, but clearly loves them all.  That's good acting!  Jessica Chastain is gorgeously ethereal - her wife/mother is also struggling at times, wanting to understand god and her husband.  And when her character whispers ""forgive"" at one point, I cried with recognition.  We do not have to be doormats, but where there is love, it is worth fighting for.

The long sequence of watching their three sons play is amazing in a very subtle way - I watched it with wonder and again, recognition.  I used to play like that.  I am from a time when we were let out early in the day and did not come home till dinner.  To watch this on a big screen is magical - just eavesdropping on these kids' play time!

I recommend reading the actual reviews of the movie so you get a good idea of the basic premise of the film.  That won't be enough, because there are surprises and layers of the movie that are too much to go into.  But it will help.  Don't talk while watching it or you will miss a LOT.  Much of what is said is inner dialogue in the characters' own heads.  But it's intense!  Very soul searching - these people are trying to understand the meaning of life, god, why things happen.  That part of it is so human.  But Malik allows us to go beyond this to a place where we don't need to know ""why"", we just kind of get it; to touch that part of us that is more than human, it is divine.",1363478400,3,3112,4.243197278911564

4302670,3,B004A8ZX32,"Pros: Okay, I'm about to pitch the perfect movie to you. Seriously, there's no way you can screw up this pitch. Are you ready? Here it is: Brad Pitt and Dinosaurs. But not in the same scene. That would be ridiculous. Don't be ridiculous. No, Mr. Pitt and these dinosaurs exist millions of years apart from each other, but they're still in the same movie. The cohesiveness of the plot thread that binds them is up to you. No matter what you come up with, I'm quite confident that you will make a winner for me.

The marketing for this film was spot on. A potential viewer could watch the trailer 100 times on loop and have the same knowledge of what happened as someone who actually saw the movie. Another potential viewer could just stare at the movie poster for two and a half hours and understand as much of the plot as I do. Okay, maybe that's a slight exaggeration. But I stress the word slight. Like, to the extreme. There's really very little embellishment there. I could talk about this movie, at length, around someone who's never seen it, and I wouldn't have to worry about ruining it for them.

Accordingly, it really is satisfying to be able to say that I've seen it, and then talk about it in pretty much any manner I feel like. It's like I now share a special connection with the two people I watched it with, because we've all experienced something that makes very little sense. In the future, I'm confident I'll be able to make a reference to one of them that won't make any more sense to any of us than it does to anyone else, but it'll still get that knowing look in return. Maybe a smile, but more likely a scowl. Either way, it'll be special. And confusing.

Did I mention there are dinosaurs?

In all seriousness, Brad Pitt really must have eaten his Wheaties this year, because he does another very good job here. Portraying the great American patriarch, he sheds his generally off-color personality and goes the straight and narrow as a complex character torn between his dreams and his responsibilities. He simultaneously gives us a father figure with whom we can identify and struggle. While he's nominated for his work in Moneyball, this performance is probably more deserving of recognition, so I will gladly give that recognition here. (You're welcome, Mr. Pitt.)

Cons: Is it possible for a movie to have so many non sequiturs that the plot itself becomes a non sequitur? Because I think that's what happened here. The thematic elements of the movie are constant, but the plot almost seems like an afterthought. What I said above about the trailer and poster giving as much clarity of vision as the movie itself was said with a completely straight face. The style of the movie is just one of images and impressions. Many of the images are actually quite evocative... In moderation. When they make up the bulk of the film, it becomes a bit much.

I was tempted here to just start listing off some of the (many) random images shown throughout the movie (really, they're ubiquitous), but then I decided that I didn't want you to hate my blog as much as a lot of people hate this movie.

I've mentioned previously how I feel about movies that lack dialog. The thing is, while it makes sense in a silent film, it makes very little sense in a movie that has dialog. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, ""Blake, that didn't make any sense what you said just now."" Welcome to The Tree of Life. Catching a theme? The point is that, yes, there is talking, which is an excellent device for advancing any plot. The problem is that the dialog in this particular movie tends to take what plot was there and tear it up and put a match to it. Most lines evoke a thought from the viewer like, ""Wait, why the hell did he say that?"" and, ""... What does that even mean?"" and, even less eloquent, ""Huh?"" And then most lines in the movie are, well, absent. I think there's a stretch of a solid half hour (although it feels like it's closer to an hour) at one point where no one says anything (because, as we all know, dinosaurs can't talk).

Overall: While I was watching the movie, if there wasn't either Brad Pitt or a dinosaur on the screen (which was about eighty percent of the movie), I was doing some combination of furrowing my brow, scratching my head, looking at the clock, and wondering when my roommate Jeff was going to say something really angry and biting. It was definitely a restless movie watching experience. Constant mental fidgeting, trying to figure out which way was up. The funny thing is that, in hindsight, I kind of appreciate it for what it was, which is a fairly spot on impressionist representation of growing up (with daddy issues), all the while questioning existence. It is a thoroughly introspective work that (either fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your perspective) doesn't really offer any answers. Just questions. I can dig it. But then I remember the extremely painful experience of actually watching the movie, and I give it a 5 out of 10 while I hope that I never have to sit through it again.",1362873600,2,5060,4.552747252747253
4302671,5,B004A8ZX32,"I've wanted to see this since watching The Thin Red Line and loving how that movie struggled with reconciling the beauty and peace of nature with the violence and grotesqueries of itself.  This movie, also by Malick, looked from the trailer to have similar themes.  This time with the backdrop of an American childhood.  Well, it does and it doesn't.
If you're looking for a movie in any traditional sense, with a plot and a story progression, then I wouldn't look here.  The movie is more like a singular artistic statement.  It's something I would expect to see playing in a museum, like when you go to an art exhibit and around some corner there are people sitting watching a short film.
The movie is full of dramatic landscapes, beautiful images and really well done camera work.  You end up caring about some the characters as you explore their being.
I'm kind of a simple ""love and honor"" sort of guy and it's possible a lot of this movie went over my head but I felt better and re-energized somehow for watching it.",1361491200,3,1022,4.557377049180328
4302672,5,B004A8ZX32,"I got a kick out of the backlash of knee jerk impulses by the general public to hate anything that has a tendency to drive them even one degree from their irrational ruts.  The point of the story is simply the natural events occurring in the lives of one American family in the 1950's from all the banal every day goings on to the inevitable tragic episodes of life transposed against the reality of the rarely considered bigger picture which has always and continues to be going on, with the immensely large and simultaneously immensely small universe.  All of this from one son's perspective.  Brilliant and refreshing.

It demonstrates the dichotomy of the seemingly importance of our own personal lives juxtaposed against a cosmos where everything is either equally important or nothing is.  That's the question we have to decide.  The truth is that it frightens people and they don't want to be forced to think about that.  The natural reaction is anger. I've seen that in people my whole life.  I don't think we should be frightened though, as much as we should be inquisitive.

4302694,5,B004A8ZX32,"How to explain a Terence Malick film to someone who has never seen one?  All at once, they are poetic, rapturous, maddening, illuminating, and even, perhaps, in a few choice moments, a bit pretentious. But one thing is for sure.  No matter what else you one might be tempted to say about a film by this man, you can never say that it is ... expected. Enter Malick's latest offering: The Tree of Life.  Lacking anything that could be conventionally described as a clear or linear storyline, the director, instead, seems utterly content to film a visual meditation on the themes of creation and evolution, fathers and sons, faith and doubt.  It is a story about a particular family rooted in a particular culture, but it's larger than that, more ambitious in its reach.  Perhaps the best way to say it is to say that while this is the story of a family set in the 1950s, it is also the timeless story of humanity and its' God.

In his book entitled Faith of the Fatherless: The Psychology of Atheism, psychologist Paul Vitz puts forth an argument in which he suggests that severe disappointment with one's biological father often leads to an individual rejecting the concept of a heavenly Father.  Tracing both the histories of prominent atheists as well as prominent theists, Vitz turns Freud's projection theory of religion on its head, as he makes a compelling case for a correlation between our willingness to conceive of a God that cares and our experiences with fathers that may or may not.

In many ways, The Tree of Life is an almost prayerful examination of Vitz's central thesis, filled with wondrous moments of staggering beauty and wrenching snapshots of belittling pain.  And in the end, you can almost hear the words of the Apostle Paul echoing through the narrated voiceover:  ""There are two ways in life: the way of nature and the way of grace.  You have to choose which one you'll follow.""

I highly recommend The Tree of Life as one of the most audacious and profound films released in this new millennium.

At the heart of the film is a story we can all relate to.  Many of us were too involved in our own adolescent struggles to pay much attention to what our younger siblings were going through. And, like Jack, to this day we regret our failures as older brothers and sisters.

A moment that will resonated strongly is when the father apologizes to Jack for being too harsh. His response is, it's your house, you can do what you want. The youthful Jack isn't yet capable of forgiveness, but he's taking the first steps on a long journey - separateness, tolerance, and eventually acceptance - that Sean Penn continues in the final scenes.

Some wag - I forget who - wrote that Malick doesn't seem to care much for people, but he obviously never met a tree he didn't like.

4302701,5,B004A8ZX32,"[*One big spoiler*] Malick muses on the music of the spheres, the interplay of forces that created and sustain the universe, and on our place within it.  We see stunning visuals of the universe exploding into existence, of stars and galaxies forming, and of the earth accreting.  Life begins, dinosaurs roam, rule, and are summarily wiped out by a random asteroid.  Quotes from the Book of Job, echoed in a church service, refer to the mystery of why bad things happen while God does nothing to prevent them.  Although there are many theological references and a definite spiritual tone to the film, it could be that the natural forces of the universe are so vast, so unpredictable and so beyond our ability to control that a capricious God the Father is as good a way to conceptualize it as any other.  The dinosaurs didn't philosophize about the random asteroid that caused their destruction, and perhaps neither should we.

Now we see the universe represented in microcosm by a family, ruled not by a god, but by a stern and sometimes capricious disciplinarian of a father.  (He demands the title, ""father,"" never ""dad."")  The eldest son can't seem to please him.  The father is emotionally distant.  Rules are set that are hard to follow, and harsh punishments are handed out for minor infractions.  The boy acts out, and is headed for delinquency, or worse.  He's jealous of his younger brother, whose musical bent and less rebellious nature attracts less unpleasant attention from the father.  But he loves and feels protective toward his younger sibling, and we get the sense that this relationship manages to get him through the trial of his upbringing, and helps him become a successful adult.

We find out at the very start of the film that the younger brother has died, with the story above unfolding in a non-sequential flashback.  At the end, we see a metaphorical reunion of the living and the spirits of the dead on what is perhaps a literal view of the plutonian shore.  With the older brother and other family members (living? dead?) in attendance, the younger brother is consigned back to the universe.

Disney called this sort of thing the Circle of Life.  But with Malick, it's more the Trajectory of Life.  Individually, we're born, we live, we mingle with and affect all the others around us, and then we die, returning to where we were before we were born.  There is a kind of consolation in the chaos, and in its relentless inevitability.  How on earth could someone turn metaphysics into a movie?

4302707,1,B004A8ZX32,"[NOTE: I am NOT concerned with revealing any spoilers here in this review, as they would only serve to help you to know what it is you missed by the time this movie is over.  Believe me, you won't figure it out when you see this movie.]

Years ago I acted in a school play and became friends with one of the leads as we practiced.  The good news: the play got rave reviews, and his role was particularly well received.  The bad news: overnight, he became an artiste, and his Army/Navy duds were quickly replaced by beret and ascot, and from then on he was too cool to be friends with the likes of me.

I think Terrence Malick might be along these lines: the darling of the elite, he frequently is awarded epithets like ""auteur,"" ""cineaste,"" ""master,"" ""genius,"" etc....  He is famously reclusive, has put out a miniscule amount of work (this is his sixth film in a little over 40 years--to which I say thank God) yet each release is cause for a film community that could not be more tickled if you stood beside them with a feather and a rubber glove.

I also assume that working for him must also be ""de rigueur"" for anyone who wishes to consider him or herself truly to have reached the pinnacle of the art.  I think it must be just as important to be able to drop the word bombs so loved by those elites who are, in fact, much like my old acting buddy: ""I was talking to Terry yesterday..."" or ""It's just like Terry said the other day...""  I cite as my evidence the ridiculous thatch of pubic hair Brad Pitt has been sporting on his chin in public over the last year or so--one can only wear such a ridiculous doo when he's been up on the mountain, man, and ""seen things...""

I don't know why I keep coming back.  While I liked the outlaw movie ""Badlands,"" in 1973, I truly believed I was DONE with him after watching several hours of windy grass in 1978's ""Days of Heaven.""  Unfortunately, I found myself too ready to forgive him twenty years later when I went to see ""The Thin Red Line,"" having read and really loved the book.  I have never wanted to switch places with a WWII soldier in the Pacific islands before, but I sincerely thought they got the better end of the deal a few hours later.

Still, I went to this one. ..what the hell was I thinking?  Sure, sure, I have no one to blame but myself.  I feel like a smoker who attempts to protest the eventual tube in my esophagus -all the while holding the cigarette to my throat and STILL puffing...

Oh--in case you're wondering--if you've read this far you MIGHT  just like this film.  We're up to the seventh paragraph and I haven't told you A THING about the plot.  You'll be waiting a lot longer to get one in this movie, and if you want to get to the meaning of this film you'll probably have to wait almost as long as the time span it covers.

Which brings to mind this fact: did I mention that it has some scenes from the DAWN OF THE UNIVERSE in this film, and they don't even occur at the START of the film?  No, they only occur after the film has shown many fuzzy, blurry shots simultaneous with inaudible whispers wherein characters without names are shown reacting to bad news we can't hear over the phone.  I for the life of me don't have any idea why Sean Penn is looking sad, as he has the second easiest pay day in recorded cinematic history:  he only has to look morose whenever the camera is on him, which is not often.

(In case you're wondering, the EASIEST payday in recorded cinematic history goes to the famous mime Marcel Marceau in Mel Brook's ""Silent Movie,"" who only had to say ""No,"" which I wish I had had the sense to say myself.)

OK, so after establishing so much so well in the early part of this film, Malick then makes the aforementioned cut to the Dawn of Time, and then of course back again (by a doorway in the sea--don't ask) to the heart of the movie.

Incidentally, this is my eleventh paragraph, and unless you've been reading them at, say, ten minutes per, I am still beating Malick's screenplay.  HERE, for about 45 minutes, the story begins to make sense, though this fact evidently must have gotten back to the director, who quickly ended the movie.  So that you will be able to tell WHEN this occurs, because nothing in the storyline will, just look to your left and right.  If people are visibly sitting there trying to read the bottom line of their movie stubs to see whether there is a refund policy, then indeed this is the end, and you may leave.

In case you didn't know--and I'm reserving this for Malick fans, as nothing obvious seems to work on you--I think this movie SUCKED, and I'm someone who LOVED ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  Douglas Trumbull worked on both films, and I respect his craft...something I can't say about my good ol' buddy Terry.

However, I did hear he's working on another one, so don't look for me when it comes out.  But, please, do what you can for the living.",1355184000,6,4894,4.318380743982495

Because there does exist a community of souls, it is possible for some other human beings to apprehend the poet's symbols of transcendence; and to draw analogies between those symbolic images and their own fleeting glimpses, in the journey of this life..."" - Russell Kirk, ""Eliot and His Age""

To begin a review of Terrence Malick's ""Tree of Life"" with a comparison of this director's artistic vision with that of T.S. Eliot is appropriate. In both we find an awestruck wonder for the immense majesty of Creation and experience. Over the course of four poems collected into ""Four Quartets,"" Eliot gives life to a perspective of the eternal: the wind-stricken stones at Burnt Norton, the god-like meander of rivers, the fields of sunflowers. While Eliot achieved all of this with words, Malick has the benefit of actual visual images, and what images they are! Coupled with a glittering soundtrack of wall-to-wall requiem masses and operatic arias, the visuals of ""Tree of Life"" are things of rare beauty and depth.

At the core, we have the story of a family in Texas told through the eyes of its eldest son. His progression away from childhood innocence toward experience and knowledge wavers between the grace of his mother (the exquisite and empyreal Jessica Chastain) and the mercurial ""tough love"" of his father (the stern and stormy Brad Pitt). Malick punctuates the narrative with grand visions of the universe in its becoming and whispered voice-over prayers. In another director's hands, the human story would have been dwarfed by the wide spaces of the stars, as if to say a man's life is infinitesimal...constricted by time, lorded over by unfathomable forces. Yet, Malick presents us with the opposite: a death in the family is the very center of the film, and the resulting spiritual journeys of the bereaved give rise to the epic scenes and silences.

Consider the perplexing and much-lauded 20-minute interlude where we break away from the family in mourning to watch the colossal genesis of time and space. Entire galaxies drip through the dark like platelets, oceans swell with invertebrate life, and dinosaurs meet in a misty creek bed. Yet, with the collision of one lethal asteroid, the unfolding pageant of life stops cold. Note how the rock gracefully glides through space, slowly turning to Berlioz's ""Offertorium,"" seeming to suggest choreography...latent intent behind the intersecting paths of planet and projectile. The following images of tundra and ice cap segue to a ""new earth"" and human life...more importantly, the human story. Malick intends us to see this impressive cosmic segment as a metaphor for, and foreshadowing of, the tragic death of the son: the cataclysm which spans the gulf between life and new life. Here we come to understand the use of Job 38 in the film's titles: what heartbreak can be beyond the comprehension of a Creator who formed such marvelous things and existed before the very bedrock cooled? By the end of the film, we find the same family meeting at the shores of Time for reunion and resignation.

Rather than a lecture on metaphysical speculations and spiritual meditations, Malick has given us the visceral images of a life augmented (not engulfed) by Mystery. It reminds us that in all this expanding and uncharted space, there is a human heart that spans and outlasts Time. As Faulkner said: ""[Man] is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance."" ""Tree of Life"" is what a film ought to be, utilizing the bare essential of the medium--the image--to arouse that sense of whelming wonder in each of us.",1354752000,3,3874,5.010869565217392

4302731,5,B004A8ZX32,"I would go out on a limb and say that there are probably not many other directors who divide the viewing public more than Terrance Malick. His films are an art form, but often they are so immersed in the art form that the viewers may lose the film before it's done. Which is a disservice. Especially since the best way to appreciate this film is by taking a step back and looking at the whole picture.

First I must comment on the blu-ray visuals. Fantastic. This is one of those films that shines. There is even a series of scenes starting with the big bang and progressing through evolution and into the 'present'. The scene could have been very disastrous. But somehow Malick makes this work.

Music is of utmost importance. There are many great tracks, but of note is the use of Smetana's Moldau. It fits the film perfectly. But the classical score is so well matched to each scene that I can't imagine watching this film without the score.

If you view the events of this film as an abstract of eastern philosophy, then it makes much more sense. Malick is putting forward the belief that all life is interconnected (hence Tree of Life). The other influence is more along the Biblical sense (kind of countering the Eastern philosophy). The premise is ""Why do we suffer?"" and in fact this is spoken aloud in the film.

The only two points that warrant me giving this a 98 out of 100: There is a scene where Chastain is floating around as if in a vortex - it was jarring and I felt the scene could have been better if she was skipping around in the forest maybe lighter than air? The other point was in the latter 3/4 part of the film. I think Malick drew out the scenes with the boys a little too much - I mentioned it to my partner (hey, I'm kind of wanting to move on past the boys' scenes) and then it changed right after that.

Sean Penn isn't in the film very much, so it's a little odd to see him get second top billing along with Pitt, but I guess his name carries weight. Brad Pitt though is phenomenal and deserves much credit for his role. Even the kids are pretty fantastic. The acting is mostly subtle and there isn't a ton of dialogue, much to the style of Malick.

I loved the film and count it among the best films in recent years. It is as close to perfection as I have seen lately. It does require one to suspend many preconceptions about film in general, but if one is able to set aside these notions and enjoy the film as a work of art as a whole, then the viewer will be rewarded.

And I highly recommend the Blu-Ray, it looks great! (And take note of the digital copy, as with most, it has an expiration date).",1354320000,,2634,4.266533066132265

4302735,5,B004A8ZX32,"The Tree of Life is a polarizing film that is not for everyone. Although it stars Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain (who both perform wonderfully), it is not a Hollywood movie by any means. The Tree of Life is a quintessential art film, and if you haven't had experience with non-traditional narrative form cinema, I suggest dipping your toes in the water elsewhere before jumping straight into the deep. That being said, The Tree of Life is a cinematic masterpiece, deeply moving and beautiful, that presents the idea of eternity and afterlife to the viewer. I have never before experienced such a marriage of spirituality and art in cinema. So for all you who lament movies such as Fireproof and Letters to God, this might be the one for you. At the same time The Tree of Life is profoundly philosophical, spiritual, and wide in its scope, it is also enigmatic. This leads some to see the movie as pretentious. However, I think it's important to consider that Malick is, quite frankly, a genius. He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University and went on to teach philosophy at MIT before he became a film maker. I cannot blame Malick for making such a cerebral and seemingly cryptic movie. Rather, I applaud artists when they make self-reflective, personal works. Malick is simply an auteur. If you are a deep thinker and enjoy filling in the pieces of the puzzle yourself, you might very well enjoy this movie.

'The Tree of Life' is an honest, no-nonsene poem about the relationship between man and what he perceives to be his maker. The main female character - who has suffered a tremendous tragedy - asks God: where were you? And then the film - for 20 minutes - moves from the creation of the Universe, to the extinction of the dinosaurs. It is here where Mark Kermode thought that Terrence Mallick lost the plot...but alas, this is where 'The Maker' answers the woman's question: I am that I am...in other words, I am the Universe, Time, Space...I am Life and Death..I am You and the One you lost, the Beginning and the End long after Humanity has seized to exist...and this answer can only be Epic and non-linear.

To 'understand' this film, one must clear ALL the nonsense in ones head about what film is and what narration is.

You cannot expect traditional story telling forms, sex, romance, action or any of the other elements that guarantee a blockbuster.  Malick wants more from his audience, and he demands with The Tree of Life.  After watching it quietly I was amazed by the beauty of the film and the performances of the actors.  Penn's part in the film was rather small, and often turned from the camera, so the high praise for his standard wrinkle browed performance puzzles me, but everyone else was brilliant.  Pitt,  Chastain, and especially the children were wonderful.  More specifically young 'Jack' as portrayed by Hunter McCraken.  This young man carries a large portion of the film, beautifully and movingly.

 After finishing the film I sat for long time thinking about the juxtaposition of the beginnings of life and the resulting intimacy of life for a human.  I wondered if I had understood Mr. Malick's message, and it's a question that I still ponder.  After all, a director is giving us his own world view.  But one thing I can be sure of; I don't think the viewer was given quite enough information about this family in a small Texas town.  We begin with the knowledge that a son has died.  But we never know how, along with other many small details.  Given the era portrayed, perhaps it was Viet Nam, with the emphasis on his age of nineteen.  If it was, then Mr. Malick overlooked the fact that military officials always come in person with the news, not a hand delivered letter or telegram.  Strangely, I came away more moved by the images of nature's amazing biological forms and a moment of mercy between two prehistoric lives, a precursor to our own.

Sometimes no words a fellow human speaks can sooth your soul, and sometimes you're tired of turning to books.

If you've seen `The Thin Red Line', then you'll probably be familiar with Malick's shooting style. It's a very artsy movie, with lots of lingering shots of people staring into nowhere, hand-held abstract close-ups, voice-overs asking philosophical questions over shots of space and opera scores, it's beautifully filmed and very close and intimate with the actors and the way everything relates back to the conflict of nature and grace, the sort of overall theme in this movie, makes it a really powerful movie to sit through.

Acting is tops, but with this cast, how can you expect anything less? Brad Pitt was brilliant as the authoritarian father and a contrast to Jessica Chastain's affectionate mother, who absolutely shines in the role. Hunter McCracken almost steals the movie as the emotionally conflicted Jack O'Brien.

With it's slower pace and contemplative tone, this is a movie that needs a chance to grow on you. It's really not the type of movie where you go in and expect the usual structure of a movie. You have to keep an open-mind and let it take you on its' ride and it becomes an engaging and thought-provoking experience, especially after the credits roll and you begin to mull things over.

As our main character is torn apart by this duality we watch him go through an emotional journey of love and forgiveness. As the character makes that journey, he takes us along with him, helping us forgive God for this world of pain but also of love.

Just end it already! Cut this sequence here! Yet amid that, this is a film that has a huge aspiration, to connect a single human life to everything in the universe, and in some ways it almost succeeds. Though I had issues throughout the film, after it was done it lingered in my mind, affected me. When I look back on it, I edit out the boring parts and appreciate the greatness. It's a film I think everyone should watch, particularly cinephiles, since what separates it from other films that might attempt similar goals is that Malick tries to do it purely cinematically. It's a powerful emotional experience.

Do I give Malick some benefit of the doubt that I might not give to another director? Sure, but still, this is some incredible material. The childhood sequence is so real, so perfect, it's hard to describe. I think there's special resonance if you grew up in the midwest but Malick does a wonderful job of butting the carefree up against the difficulties of adulthood.

As with other recent Malick works, at times the voiceover can be murky so it's hard to separate character voices, a good sound system helps. Spectacular performance from Jessica Chastain and Brad Pitt deserves more credit than he'll ever get. There's an argument that they're too one-dimensional, but I think there is a lot of subtlety and complexity in the characters.

My advice is to plan to take a break in the middle as it is overlength and can wear you down because the excesses are clear. Do that, keep an open mind and let the experience take you over. This is really an extraordinary piece of work, despite its flaws.

It's an easy film for people to hate on, but I'm grateful an artist like Malick is taking on a challenge like this.",1342742400,2,1994,4.56145251396648
4302830,4,B004A8ZX32,"Terrence Malick is one of those directors who divides audiences.  His films are so entrenched in who he is as a visionary that one cannot separate art from artist and thus his works all seem to carry a common bond that either draws us to them or repels us.  I have a typically fond relationship with Malick.  I find him fascinating, even when I find his film's bordering on self-indulgent.  He knows what he wants to say and he will stop at nothing to convey his message.  While I cannot say that I thoroughly enjoy all of his features, I can say that he is a director I respect immensely.

For me, `The Tree of Life' is one of those instances where Malick's own vision got in the way of his storytelling.  He has such an important point to make regarding life affirmations, spirituality and the languishing effects of loss, but elements of this film take us out of that vision and strip away some of the effect.

This is probably the most complex and captivating film of 2011, but its flaws (for me) pull it back from being one of the best.

In broken fragments, Malick tells us the story of the O'Brien family.  It also tells the story of the birth of life here on earth.  In effect, it is telling the same story yet in alternating realities.  In the 50's, the O'Brien household is fractured by conflicting parental approaches.  Mrs. O'Brien is a loving and nurturing caretaker, while Mr. O'Brien is harsh, rigid and unapproachable.  As their three sons grow up, they are molded by the relationships formed with their parents.  In adulthood, it is obvious that their eldest son Jack is still haunted by his unhealthy relationship with his father.  Death weighs down on the family at one point, which is addressed on the film's outset and yet not wholly developed until later.

The problem I have with `The Tree of Life' is the way in which the film is constructed.  You have three alternating storylines (the O'Brien family, the birth of life and Jack's adulthood) and they don't ever seem to mesh in a way that completes this story.  They feel too solitary, causing riffs in the way in which the film impacts the audience.  When sewn together or reflected on as a whole they can serve as powerful companion pieces, but in viewing they never truly feel connected or cohesive.  The way they weave in and out of one another feels almost lazy and reckless.  The segments regarding adult Jack serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever because they are so skeletal in development that they completely unearth the film and divert it.  Sure, they are beautifully shot and add some texture to the film's already stunning cinematography, but emotionally they add nothing.  The story of the birth of life is stunning to witness.  It is some of the most beautifully imagery and emotional clarity put to celluloid in recent memory, and yet their abrupt arrival feels a tad forced.  I wanted an organic segue and yet I was left wondering why Malick chose that particular spot for this spiritual departure.

Pitt, Chastain and McCracken are all outstanding here.  Their performances should have all been up for Oscars, they are that organic and beautifully composed.

As a whole, I really liked this film and I have a feeling that time could be kind to this and cause me to love it.  It is a film that certainly says more the more you debate it, but it doesn't necessarily say all that much while you watch it.  Like I said, Malick is a masterful filmmaker.  He has etched out some serious masterpieces in his time.  At times though, he can let his imaginations get the better of him and his vision becomes cloudy in his own hands.  `The Tree of Life' feels a tad cloudy, despite having a very rich story to tell.",1342483200,3,3698,4.586890243902439

Seems like a story about a little kid growing up with an abusive father and loving Mother. Centers on one kid in the family who seems to be turning out like his father. The ending was completely crazy, the father loses his job and they pack up the car and I have no idea what was going on after that. First I thought they were going science fiction or something. If this is art then it is bazaar.

I would not recommend buying this unless you at least watch a preview.

I see a lot of people love this movie and I normally love deep alternative type films but this was just a bunch of images and not even a good soundtrack. I watched it to the end thinking something would come together but it never did.",1342224000,3,891,4.085714285714285
4302833,5,B004A8ZX32,"As you can see by the ratings here, this is a very divisive film, with very few opinions falling ""in the middle."" I can fully understand and appreciate why so many found it difficult to sit through. On the one hand, it is a frustrating film in that there is no real narrative to cling to - and nothing resembling a traditional scene until nearly 50 minutes in!

On the other hand, it is... beautiful... that word, beautiful, just seems inadequate.. but I really can't think of a more fitting word. If you are unable to view this in HD, you really might do better to put it off until you can.

The narrative, sparse as it is, opens with news that the middle child of a family has died. After several scenes of grief, we get a nearly 20 minute rendering of the creation of the cosmose, set to a gorgeous choral piece. Following the cosmic creation, we next see the individual creation of a boy, and will follow him from birth through to his mid-teens. It is at this age that the movie settles into a narrative flow as we see this eldest son, Jack, and his growing resentment toward his father and his uneven parenting. We are basically hovering like an observing angel as we watch Jack's first steps into adulthood... his loss of innocence, his sexual awakening, and his first mature realization of who his dad really is... in a manner that fuses both disillusionment and atonement...

The photography, natural lighting, location, everything coalesces into a seamless portrait of a decade gone by. Nothing about this movie feels like a modern day crew shooting a period piece ... every shot, every scene from the 50s feels absolutely authentic.

The themes of grace and nature and how they converge in a child coming of age are expertly expressed through the imagery, the jarring edit, and the exquisite preamble sequence of the creation of the universe.

The way imagery tells the story, rather than verbose writing, sets this apart from almost any other movie I've ever seen. You don't have to listen to the father explain that he's losing connection with his family, you SEE it happen. You don't have to hear the children explain that one-by-one they have distanced themselves from their father, you SEE it happen!

The way the edit jumps from moment to moment ... unconnected in sequence, yet we can still make the coherent connections ourselves... makes this the SINGLE BEST PORTRAYAL OF MEMORY I've seen in film! This movie absolutely plays like your own memory of childhood does, and not a ""here's what happened, then this happened, then that happened, and now you know the story of my youth.""

Pitt and Chastain play their respective parts with perfect subtlty - a credit to the actors, but also to Malick, the writer and director. It would have been easy to create an image of an overly abusive father, but Pitt's character is much more complex. He's not a bad man by any stretch, but he is flawed. He tries his best to love his children and raise them properly - but he also takes out his own feelings of inadequacy on them - not physically, but emotionally. It's a role that would be easy to overdo by any other actor, but Pitt manages expertly.

Chastain, meanwhile, represents the presence of grace - a safe haven for the children - and a better piece of casting I cannot imagine - her face is the face of MOTHER. Loving, accepting, unjudging, even in anger...

If the film has a flaw, it is in its inability to postively connect the events of the 50s to those of the 70s and the present day - and maybe this would be rectified in a second viewing - but after I finished the film, I felt that there were two narratives here, with the sequence of the 50s being the chief story. The secondary one is the ""frame"" story, if you will, of R.L.'s death, which opens the film. As I watched the movie unfold, I figured we were going to see the moments leading up to his death. But it is later revealed he died as a 19 year old, an age which we never see him. This event, though it powers the first 30 minutes of the movie, ultimately has no bearing on anything that you see. It felt like a last minute inclusion - a way to open on an emotional note. But, the movie is really about Jack and his memory of his parents, and NOT about R.L.

Now, as a Christian, I can see how the death in the beginning and the repeated refrain of ""where were you"" asked toward God leads seamlessly into the story of creation, as it does in the biblical book of Job, a quote of which we see in the opening of the film. But, the average viewer is not going to get this connection - and I felt the movie could have skipped the death/grief sequence and not been any the weaker. I think that time could have been better focused on creating a more coherent storyline for Sean Penn's portrayal of the adult Jack.

But, as I said, perhaps a second viewing will change my mind. In any event, it isn't a big enough weakness to detract from what is otherwise a VERY powerful experience!

Know going in that this is NOT a movie about narrative - there is no beginning, middle, end... no protagonist/antagonist... this is about feeling an emotion, experiencing a memory, and connecting to the larger force that is God and Creation. If that isn't something you are ready for, then do not bother watching this movie - you'll simply walk away thinking it the most pretentious piece of indie art-house indulgence.

Also know going in that this is NOT a movie that can be watched if you are distracted by anything - this is a movie that you need to clear about 2 and a half hours and watch uninterrupted. Probably best to watch it alone, so there is no risk of your fellow viewers talking during the experience. And as I said, watch it on Blu-Ray... THIS IS A MUST!

It's a shame Malick produces movies at such a slow rate, but if that's what it takes to work at this level, then so be it. This is the first of his I've seen, and I am eagerly looking forward to seeing his other works, few as they are.",1342137600,9,5966,4.431569343065694
4302834,1,B004A8ZX32,"I love art films...but not when I am aware of the  ""art"" in each and every frame of the film.  THE TREE OF LIFE is one of the most self-conscious movies I have ever watched.  Terrence Malick's ponderous, pretentious, painful mode of movie-making as evidenced in this puerile effort is intensely irritating, emotionally deadening and boring beyond belief.  CITIZEN KANE is an arty film with immense stylistic, bravura flourishes - and even when one is aware of its own artistic awareness, the movie still captivates and enthralls and enriches the viewer.  But with this attempted tone poem of a picture, the artifice reigns supreme and therefore the story and its many messages fall fatally flat. Kubrick's masterpiece 2001 - which this film in reminiscent of in many instances - is also a stylistically self-conscious work.  Yet, as with KANE, the artfulness of the film serves the narrative.  With THE TREE OF LIFE the story - what there is of it - is subservient to the style, the art of it all.  Terrence Malick would do well to adhere to a very great dictum for art of all kinds - and that is that art...should conceal art.  In other words, when I see a movie I don't want to see a movie.  Watching THE TREE OF LIFE I was always aware of the director over my shoulder and behind each and every frame of HIS film. And being cognizant of the artifice, the hoped for experience of the movie became instead an insult to the intelligence.

This movie is annoying in so very many ways. How many barely audible whispered voice-overs can one bear?  Apart from their often annoying inaudibility, many times it isn't even clear which character is doing the talking.  How many shots of touching hands against the blue sky underscored by hopefully heavenly music does one have to see to get the point?  How many shots do we need to see of Sean Penn walking around looking as if he is wondering how he even wandered into this movie which makes absolutely no use of his considerable acting talents?  How much of Brad Pitt's self-conscious curl of the lower lip - as if that curled lip is enough to create a credible character - must one withstand?  How many times do we have to see the young Jack look like he is about to discover some great secret to the accompaniment of the movie's also self-conscious score?  And what of laughter?  Levity?  Romance? Sexuality? The sheer Joy of Life?  Life has all of these riches - yet this funereal film, THE TREE OF LIFE, has very little of those elements.  It is dull and lugubrious and in its attempt to grapple with the largest issues of Life, it neglects or forgets or self-consciously deletes so many of the elements that truly make Life analogous to a Tree.

Think of a beautiful woman entering a room. She is undoubtedly beautiful - but she knows it and is also obsessively self-conscious with that knowledge.  She is overly perfumed and made-up, jewels everywhere, extravagantly dressed and looking for the nearest mirror so that she might bask in the glory of her own self-love. She goes far in destroying her own beauty with her self-conscious display of it. Now picture another beautiful woman coming into the room. This woman is not overly adorned or perfumed or made-up. Her eyes are the jewels she wears. The difference between the two women is that this one is not so certain of her charms so downplays the outward so as not to feel uncomfortable or seem ridiculous should those unnecessary embellishments diminish what she intrinsically possesses. This woman captivates and ultimately can obsess others because she, herself, is not unduly obsessed by that which she possesses by nature. Well, this movie is akin to the first women in this analogy.  The excessive surface of its outward look hides whatever inner, deeper values might be found therein.

This movie's basic premise and design - in the hands of a more all-embracing and much more nuanced and subtle director - may have actually been a great movie.  For example, I had no problem with the storyline's non-linear structure or with bringing dinosaurs into the mix.  As a matter-of-fact, first hearing that this movie made such quantum leaps in its storyline made me want to really see it.  But though the intentions of the movie may have been sublime whilst still a thought, the execution sadly killed any power the finished product may have had.  Thus, to me, THE TREE OF LIFE seems more of a big-budgeted, big-starred student-film inter-cut with home movies and lost footage from 2001 than it does the work of matured and visionary film maker.  All in all, I would rather watch paint peel than have to watch this movie ever again. Better still, I think I'll watch 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY for the umpteenth time!",1341878400,21,4717,4.70316301703163

***This review may contain spoilers**

Finally finding the leisure time and inclination, I watched ""The Tree of Life"" (hereafter ToL) on HBO on Sunday, July 8, 2012 at 9:40 a.m.  At the end, I concluded that if you 1) like going to church, 2) like thinking about the movies you watch and/or 3) don't mind following a convoluted non-linear plot, then ""Tol"" should satisfy you.  If you don't like doing any of the aforementioned things, then ""ToL"" will probably be a boring slog.

I agree with the posters who advise viewers to watch ""ToL"" with a calm, contemplative attitude, because ""Tol"" indeed is not your conventional fun time at the movies.  The director Terrence Malick recklessly and audaciously is swinging for the spiritual fences and is daring to ask the Big Questions about morality, God's justice (or lack thereof), man's relationship to God, why even good people suffer, all that deep stuff.  However, Malick collides with the inherent, unavoidable problem any director challenging the infinite has: his literal, visual interpretation of God's mind is necessarily, pretentiously inadequate.  I am referring to the admittedly spectacular biological, psychological, paleontological, and cosmic images wafting through ""ToL"".  The quiet images, by themselves, announce to those who are receptive that, yeah, God is great and majestic.  No real problem there, even if time-worn, if Malick had left it at that and created a balanced version of ""Koyaanisqatsi"", the 80's film that used human images to illustrate life's chaos.

However, Malick artificially grafts this ""divine imagery"" to an earthy, earthly tale of the chronological history of a `50s Texas family headed by a somewhat disciplinarian, occupationally frustrated father (Brad Pitt) and gentle, compassionate mother (Jessica Chastain).  Respectively, they personify the perennial nature vs. nurture conflict (I prefer the word ""nurture"" to the vague term ""grace"").  Knowing them only by their last names Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien solidifies their symbolic status.  The true conflict revolves around the festering rivalry between the father and his oldest son Jack (Hunter McCracken as a boy, Sean Penn as an adult).  The languid, usually silent, and twisty progression of the family's life, beginning toward the end when it receives a telegram informing them of the death of, I assume, the second oldest brother as a (I think) Vietnam soldier, and the events that test their mettle and their faith, is also compelling, again by itself.

But when ""ToL"" attempts to meld these two tropes, the mundane and the ethereal, I'm afraid it dilutes the power of both tropes.  I think I see the movie's purpose here; to show that God transcends mere earthly affairs and that the power of caring, of love, of nurture will quash the woes and cares of brute animal nature and will bring us peace, at least in the afterworld.  Again, it's a noble purpose that few movies dare touch.  But, you know, the result comes across as preachy and simplistic and as platitudinous as the well-meaning but hackneyed words of comfort the Grandmother (Fiona Shaw) gives Mrs. O'Brien after she gets that telegram.

If Malick had exclusively taken the ""2001/Koyaanisqatsi"" route or ""Great Santini"" route, personally I would have more impressed.  By combining them in ""ToL"" it makes the effort seem a little self-conscious and forced.  Lovely and stunning as the ""cosmic"" images were, I would have excised them and kept the remaining family structure, even the dreamy, stream-of-consciousness elements intact.  That way, we could see the O'Brien family legitimately wrestle with their psychosocial and spiritual dilemmas (especially Jack's concern that he is emulating the less admirable aspects of his father's character) and arrive (or not arrive) at a resolution.  Frankly, the cosmic images are, I think, a tad artistically dishonest, because we the audience can witness them and perhaps take solace from them, while the mundane O'Briens cannot.  Too dues ex machina for my taste.

Therefore, my verdict on ""ToL"" is ambiguous.  I aesthetically appreciated Malick's attempt at apotheosis, to remind us that love is the path to God.  But my intellect recoiled at the clichd imagery ""ToL"" resorted to in order to demonstrate this, even if the movie had to.  But I can just envision posters telling me, ""Don't think about the movie too much, just feel it.""  I suppose.  If you just let ""ToL""s flow bear you along, it may make you feel better.  Very well - 3.5 stars out of 5.

P.S.: Two trivial points - first, the plesiosaur depicted in the movie could never had curled its neck backwards the way it did.  Fossil studies show it lacked that flexibility.  Second, the raptor shown later in the movie probably spared the prostrate hadrosaur not because it was merciful, but because it was not hungry.",1341792000,3,4852,5.129770992366412
4302837,4,B004A8ZX32,"Well, goodness.  So many angry, upset people who regret having wasted their time watching this film.  Really?  Okay.  I can see that.  I agree wholeheartedly that the film is too long and the editors could have easily sliced out a good thirty minutes and not damaged the movie at all. It DOES drag on in places, and some of it is just too obscure and metaphorical.  In fact, I totally expected to hate this film after reading some of the reviews in advance.  Then someone, somewhere reviewed The Tree of Life and wrote that Brad Pitt's character and Jessica Chastain's character (mom and dad in the movie) represent the two equal natures (perceptions?) of God:  the strong disciplinarian and the loving, forgiving, nurturing Giver of grace.  If viewed from that perspective from the get-go, the movie tends to make a lot more sense, especially in light of the mother's opening monologue in which she talks about each person's choice between nature and grace.  In fact, I was shocked to see how many Scriptural references there actually are in this movie, especially since Brad Pitt and Sean Penn have always presented themselves as stridently anti-Christian and anti-religion.  Obviously the very first shot of the quote from the Book of Job is a reference to the Bible; however, there are others. **SPOILER ALERT***  For example, at one point, young Jack is reflecting on his own bad behavior and says, ""The things I want to do I can't do, and what I don't want to do, I keep on doing,"" or words to that effect.  This is reminiscent of Paul's remarks in Romans 7 in the New Testament.  Young Jack is confused and frustrated by his own sinfulness (bullying, animal cruelty, vandalism, breaking and entering, stealing, etc.) and says, ""I want to be back where they are,"" meaning his younger brothers and their friends, who are still fairly innocent and naive.  I also respect how the film deals with the faith-shattering disillusionment that often comes as a result of terrible tragedy.  The characters ask God, ""Where are you?  Are you even here?""  Jack remarks that, ""You call to me; I've always known it was you, but I have turned away from you.""  These are all very valid responses, and very realistic.  Before everyone gets all bent out of shape, I am NOT saying the movie is a Christian allegory or that it is proselytizing in any way.  However, there is a definite spiritual element to the film, and it actually fits very well with the absolutely stunning visual imagery (creation, random destruction, etc.).  Does Sean Penn's character die at the end, or is he only dreaming?  That's not entirely clear, but we do hear a steady beeping (heart monitor?) in the background which eventually fades out as he crosses through a portal and then ""reunites"" with members of his family from long ago. A reference to the afterlife?  Maybe. It's not a bad film, just poorly edited, in my very humble opinion.  The dinosaurs kind of trivialized it, and I know Mom floating under the tree (her ethereal, lighthearted forgiving essence?) made people cringe.  All in all, I may have to check out Terence Malick's other movies.  This one was very intriguing.",1341705600,3,3148,4.792207792207792
4302868,5,B004A8ZX32,"Few directors have as instinctive a flair for the art of cinema as Terrance Malick, who is such a perfectionist about his work that he's managed to crank out a mere five feature films in his four decades as a filmmaker.  His films are like glorious odes to nature, much in the tradition of Wordsworth and Coleridge - only, in this age of modern technology, he uses images rather than words.  He makes us see the world from a whole new perspective, employing cinematography and music in much the same way as an impressionist uses paint on a canvas.

Watching a Malick film - to mix up our metaphors a bit - is a bit like sitting at the edge of the ocean, as wave after wave of indescribably beautiful images washes over you and eventually carries you out to sea.  It really is an experience unlike any other that one can get at the movies.

His latest work ""The Tree of Life"" is clearly his magnum opus, the culmination of his career-long obsession with the beauty of nature and mankind's relation to it.  It is also his most overt dissertation to date on the random nature of the universe, as it chronicles a family's struggle to come to grips with the sudden death of their 19-year-old son and brother, R.L.

The majority of the film takes place in Waco, Texas in the 1950s, where the oldest son Jack and his two younger brothers, R.L. and Steve, are experiencing a childhood very similar to that of many middle-class Americans of the time.  In fact, when it isn't busy being metaphysical and exploring the mysteries of the universe, ""The Tree of Life"" provides a searing look into suburban family life during that time period.  Indeed, even though the characters don't say much to one another throughout the course of the movie - most of the words come in the form of voiceover narration - each still manages to become a fully realized individual in his or her own right, a character very much of that time but also universal in scope.

Mr. O`Brien (Brad Pitt), for instance, is a rather archetypal father figure of the 1950s - an emotionally aloof disciplinarian who finds it so hard to express his feelings for his boys that at one point Jack finds himself wishing for his own father's death.  Yet, O'Brien still displays those rare moments of tenderness that reveal the caring and loving individual that resides at his core.  O'Brien is also struggling with the fact that he has never achieved his dreams either as a musician or as a successful inventor.  This leads to a sense of bitterness and a kill-or-be-killed ethos that not only defines his own life but is the major value he wants to instill in his boys.

Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) is also a fairly typical 1950s housewife - a generally passive woman utterly consumed with raising her family and defending her boys against the frequent outbursts her husband throws at them.  In a way, she is the yin to Mr. O'Brien's yang, a woman filled with the virtues of understanding and nurturing, who balances out the unyielding rigidness of her husband and gives her sons an alternative path to follow in life.

Jack is also a highly complex character, a naturally curious, strong-willed and contemplative young boy who wants desperately to do the right thing but often feels unable to do it.  His strong moral code is frequently at odds with his penchant for mischief and, like all children who are just finding their way, he often chooses the wrong path to go down.  Indeed, the film provides one of the most realistic depictions of childhood I have seen in a long while, capturing the wonderment, fear and sense of exploration that defines that period in life.

Sean Penn, in a much smaller role, plays the adult version of Jack, who, even in the present day, is trying to come to grips with his little brother's untimely death.  But it is Hunter McCracken as the young Jack who brings the film to life and makes us care about the character.

As with any Malick film, ""The Tree of Life"" derives a tremendous amount of its greatness from its camerawork and sound and, true to form, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and composer Alexandre Desplat provide their customary miracles here.  No other movie quite looks like a Malick film, with its smooth-flowing tracking shots - many following a character from behind - its intimate close-up shots of nature, and its haunting, painterly landscapes.  For this film, Malick has added several scenes depicting the formation of the earth, the evolution of life and the destruction of the planet - all to illustrate the we're-all-interconnected, circle-of-life theme that resides at the movie's core.

Yet while ""The Tree of Life"" is certainly Malick's most ambitious work to date, is it also his finest?  I really don't think so.  Even though it is completely mesmerizing as a work of pure cinema - few other directors could even touch it - it exudes a certain self-congratulatory pretentiousness that is missing from what I think are his best films, ""Badlands"" and ""The New World,"" which, on the whole, feel somehow more organic and natural.  In a sense, it's trying so hard to be great - hardly a commonplace sin in American moviemaking - that it actually feels a little off-putting and desperate at times.  Genuine masterpieces - which I believe ""Badlands"" and ""The New World"" to be - don't generally have to work so hard at it.

But then again, in this day and of formulaic and soulless commercial moviemaking, we'll take a near-masterpiece any time we can get one.",1341705600,4,5472,4.70649895178197

The previews certainly didn't give me a fair idea what I was about to subject myself to. Had I seen it in a cinema, it would have been the very first movie I'd ever walked out on.

Really. It was that bad.

Movies should entertain, tell a story, make one think, or any combination of the above. ""Tree of Life"" was not entertaining, didn't tell a coherent story, and the only things it made me think were: 1) This would make a great screensaver, 2) It would probably be *fascinating* if marijuana were legal, and 3) I bet the critics adored it. There was only the barest suggestion of a ""plot,"" interrupted by tedious, dreamlike sequences punctuated by whispered, non-informative voice-overs. This guy Malick must be the Yoko Ono of movies.

4302872,5,B004A8ZX32,"I must confess, at the outset, that I am a big fan of all of Terrence Malick's films. And this one just added to that bias. I think he takes the artform to another plane; they are not just movies, they are visual, epic poems. There is absolutely no question when you are watching ""Tree of Life"" you are watching a Malick film.

But I must also confess that his films are demanding. They're like reading Melville or Joyce. Or listening to Mahler. You have to experience them more than once to appreciate all the subtlety and apparent meaning. And you have to be paying attention. ""Tree of Life"" is no exception. For instance, it is not clear, until the end, which son is the narrator, making the movie a mystery in the tradition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizen-Kane-70th-Anniversary/dp/B005MMY5RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizen Kane (70th Anniversary)</a>or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Club/dp/B001H1SVO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Club</a>. The narrative is non-linear, and the editing feels, at first, random and jarring, until you get into the unique time-space that marks a Malick universe. And the relationship of Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain, as husband and wife, is also ambiguous and at times frighteningly tense, as a child's perception of his own parents' marriage often is. All of this requires getting used to. And more than one viewing.

For any man with a father, ""Tree of Life"" is a strongly affecting movie. I found it hard to watch without choking up. While it was a very different style of movie, the theme of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Fish/dp/B0001GOH6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Fish</a>, Tim Burton's own monument to the complex relationship of father and son, was on my mind as I watched Tree of Life.

4302873,4,B004A8ZX32,"American film director Terrence Malick's fifth feature film release, in four decades in the business, The Tree Of Life, is a film that, in parts, has some of the greatest techniques and moments ever recorded in film history, but it also has some fatal narrative flaws that prevent it from outright greatness, as an overall work of art, and possibly the worst ending to a near-great film since Akira Kurosawa's 1950 classic, Rashomon, while at the same time having one of the most self-indulgent and showoffy endings to a film since Federico Fellini's 8. More reprehensible than anything the film does, positively or negatively, is how utterly over the top some praise of the film has been, and how utterly ridiculous some of the criticism of the film has been. Granted, some of this has been generated by Malick, and the promotional efforts for the film, but, frankly, many big name, and lesser name critics, have simply imbued and misconstrued their own critical lack and imaginative dead rot into their reviews, and missed the boat on this film, from some of its most basic elements through its more nuanced themes and evocations.",1340236800,,1132,4.901041666666667
4302874,4,B004A8ZX32,"The Tree of Life is an ambitious and at times powerful film liberally dappled with moments of deep introspection on the meaning of fatherhood and family. The visuals are often astonishing, complementing the superb acting by the well selected cast. Director Terrence Malick (The Thin Red Line) juxtaposes the wonder of birth with the agony of death and guides the viewer to ponder the meaning of it all. Brad Pitt (Legends of the Fall, Seven, 12 Monkeys, Inglorious Basterds) puts on an earnest and riveting performance as the stern father whose disciplinary approach to work and family results in consequences not intended. Sean Penn (Taps, Sweet and Lowdown, Mystic River) is perfectly cast as the haunted oldest son that reflects on his anger with his father, his remorse over his eldest brother, and the empathy of his mother. And the beautiful Jessica Chastain (The Debt) has a turn as the quiet, but strong woman who endures her husband's struggles as the bread winner while raising three willful sons.

Jack O'Brien (Penn) has reached middle age, the same age at which his father (Pitt) was when his elder brother R.L. (Laramie Eppler) was killed, probably in combat during the Vietnam War (although this is not stated). Jack, apparently childless and unmarried (again unstated), meanders through his memories of his childhood in an attempt to understand how he had arrived at this point of his life. As an architect he has risen beyond the aspirations of his engineer father, yet in some ways has failed to achieve the things his dead brother had accomplished thirty years in the past.

His adolescent bullying of R.L. has left him with profound guilt, particularly as it arose as a way of lashing out at his father, who was always above reproach. Only later following a humiliating demotion did his father acknowledge his regret at his harshness during Jack's upbringing, explaining once again that it was only his intent to adequately prepare his sons for the harsh realities of adult life. And in fact Jack eventually benefits from his upbringing, successfully controlling his own career. But at what emotional cost?

Malick also teases the audience with the larger issue of relevance. The Earth is impossibly old, and whole eras have lived and perished before the advent of modern civilization. Similarly the universe will exist far into the future, long after the ashes of today's era are only a memory. So why does life matter, particularly in the face of the pointlessness of death?

The moral of the story of course is that life is short and that one must bear up under the worst and reconcile with those they love to truly make the best of things. This is pretty weighty stuff. In fact the poignancy of how this message is delivered often leaves the audience adrift in their own thoughts, hurrying to catch up.

Emmanuel Lubezki's (Meet Joe Black, Sleepy Hollow, Burn After Reading) beautiful cinematography takes full advantage of the period sets and costumes, while special effects guru Douglas Trumbull (Blade Runner, Star Trek, Close Encounters of the Third Kind) marries fully rendered CGI scenes with experimental old school visualizations. Trumbull's efforts are hit and miss. While the CGI is ingenious, the pre-CGI motion photography is no better than that found at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey, another film he was the visual effects supervisor for. As in the older film the manual effects leave too much room for interpretation and actually distracts from the look and feel of the otherwise smooth editing (Hank Corwain, Jay Rabinowitz, Daniel Rezende, Billy Weber, Mark Yoshikawa) and storyline.

Sean Penn, in spite of his repulsive politics, is insightful when he sticks to his own area of expertise--filmmaking. His remarks included an observation that the film would have been more effective with additional narration, something this reviewer agrees with. But he also acknowledged that those that watch the film with an open mind were likely to find their own ""emotional or spiritual connection to it.""

One remarkable detail was the lack of lines for all but the Mr. O'Brien character. Penn had no lines at all. Chastain had a few, although they were important to the storyline.

Pacing was an issue at times. The adolescent scenes dragged on in excess long after they had accomplished their mission. In contrast scant footage was given to Penn, making it difficult to connect the younger and older self. There were other problems. The beginning of the film starts with the death of R.L., and the manner in which the scenes are shot left the audience grasping at loose ends in confusion while trying to make sense of it all. Also the end was excessively cryptic and unsatisfying, with visuals taking priority over plot elements or even comprehensibility.

The film also misses badly with some demographics. The sweet spot among viewers were those with brothers and those with children. But for sisters, young adults, and older adults with no children, the movie had a limited appeal at best or the potential for an utter lack of understanding at worst. It is because of this and the unconventional visuals that the movie was as likely as not to be made at all. This reviewer suspects that only Brad Pitt's involvement and his agreement to play the Mr. O'Brien character allowed the movie to gain sufficient financial backing to be shot and released under Fox Searchlight as an indy film. This theory is given further credence by the fact that most of the talent that worked on the film has an association with either Malick, Pitt, Penn, or all three.

The Tree of Life did garner three Academy Award nominations (Director, Picture, Cinematography), although it was never a seriously in contention for any. It did win a number of secondary awards, mostly for cinematography (well deserved), and for Chastain as supporting actress. The movie was a domestic bust ($13M) given its lush budget ($32M) for special effects, period sets, and costuming. It did pull down $41M internationally, but it is difficult to translate those dollars into profits given the wide range of distribution costs that are possible.

In the end, the picture's primary winners were Chastain, Penn, Pitt, and 20th Century Fox. Chastain's performance launched her into instant stardom, and Pitt and Penn both solidified their reputations as serious actors. In Pitt's case one hopes his company (Plan B Entertainment) didn't take too much of a bath on backing the film. Fox Searchlight got an expensive but effective piece of advertising for its Searchlight brand.

As for Malick, well, he may never get so close again to an Oscar. The Tree of Life was chock full of talent both in front and behind the camera, an ensemble that will be difficult to duplicate in today's highly competitive filming environment. It would have helped if the film was a financial success or had a wider appeal among audiences. Instead it ended up being an art house film with aspirations for critic's plaudits that just missed being truly great.",1339804800,,7030,4.9736170212765956

The pain afterwards was akin to having metal screws drilled into my skull.  I would willingly relive that pain again before I see Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life for a second time.

Five minutes into this movie, I wanted to shoot the director.  The whispered dialogue doesn't establish any of the characters and yields a story that has to be guessed at.  Then there's a 30-minute ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" drug sequence that shows beautiful images and concludes with dinosaurs before going back to the Texas home of the characters introduced earlier.  At this point, I was already asleep.  I contend that The Tree of Life robs one of one's pranic life energy.  It has beautiful cinematography but no payoff, nothing to justify the journey.

Even if you fail to ""get"" the film on the most basic level, you simply cannot go on to say that it is ""stupid"", ""pointless"", ""pretentious"", or, my personal favorite, ""boring"".

This culture is entirely spoiled. We've lost our sense of wonder and mystery. We have to have everything ""now"". We need our action ""now"". We need explosions, we need CGI, we need a very specific, meticulously spoon-fed ""plot"" to move us along. We cannot think for ourselves. We do not value ambiguity. We do not appreciate slow-pacing, and we don't want to ""experience"" film. We do not want film to become an extension of the soul. 'Tree of Life' is exactly that. It is the most important film to come along in decades, yet people will condemn it, while they toss accolades to the likes of 'Iron Man' and 'Twilight'.

4302922,4,B004A8ZX32,"MOVIE RATING:  4 stars (B+)

One of the most mysterious and interesting auteur filmmakers out there right now is director Terrence Malick. No one else seems to inspire as many rumors, stories and myths about what they are up to as Malick. When will we see a new film from him? What will the film be about? What's the title of the film? Malick's movies tend to languish in the news for years simply titled as ""Untitled Terrence Malick Film"". But 2011 saw the birth, both literally and figuratively, of a brand new Malick movie: The Tree Of Life (2011). This is only Malick's fifth film in a career spanning over 40 years. But his five films are iconic pieces of filmmaking art. I've seen them all and I highly recommend you see each and every one to really understand any one of them. They cling together with a web of subliminal meaning that has taken me years to contemplate. My favorite, hands down, is The Thin Red Line (1998), the most masterful look at war, and man for that matter, ever made. It's one of my Top 10 movies of all time. It took me years and repeated viewings to fully appreciate it.

Like all of Malick's films, upon first viewing The Tree Of Life (in the theater a year ago), I was confronted with reconciling my very high expectations for the film with the actual film that Malick delivered. It's taken a year of simmering inside me to really figure out how I feel about it. And after viewing it in its entirety for a 2nd time on blu-ray recently, I feel ready to discuss the film and my thoughts and feelings about it. While The Tree Of Life still makes me question its meaning and intentions, I appreciate it a little more than during my first time. It's a movie that makes it hard for me to love because it goes way outside the box of normal narrative storytelling. I love strong dialogue driven movies. And The Tree Of Life is not that kind of movie. In fact, this movie probably has less dialogue than any other feature length movie I love. But the subtext in the visuals, music, and feel of the film really got into me during this second viewing because my expectations of wanting dialogue and narrative were gone. Instead of constantly waiting for the movie to give me what I want, like I did the first time, I accepted it for what it is and got something else. Looking back on all 5 of Malick's movies now, I can see that they all do the same thing. None of them delivered what I wanted or expected from them the first time I saw them. But after letting that go, I was able to appreciate them on subsequent viewings. My initial rating for The Tree Of Life was 3.5 stars but I've since updated it to 4 stars.

I'm not going to try to provide a narrative summary or character descriptions for this film since it really means nothing to understanding this film. Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Sean Penn and the three young boys (Hunter McCracken, Laramie Eppler, and Tye Sheridan) who play Pitt and Chastain's sons are all fantastic in their performances. They are not showy performances with scene-chewing speeches, but they are powerfully quiet and subtle performances rooted in deep character development. It's so clear that they all lived in the shoes of their characters during production on this movie. Malick's style of shooting demands that anyways from what I understand. I think Malick really nailed the casting on this film. Pitt and Chastain couldn't be more different yet complimentary in their roles as universal representations of ""nature"" and ""grace"". They just work together in this story. I actually think the 3 boys did the most with their roles. Their very naturalistic performances really brought my own childhood memories and feelings to life through their eyes.

As with every Malick film, the production design, cinematography, sound, music, and editing are simply the best. I don't know what else to say. There's no room for improvement in any of those areas and the craftsmanship on this movie is really beyond perfection, even though I know that's not possible. But that's the experience I get. It really is astounding to see Malick and his incredible team provide such a meticulous and beautiful film. It has a natural and organic feel to it, yet I know that every single frame of the film and second of sound has been masterfully thought about by someone. Somehow Malick's style of filmmaking follows all the rules and breaks all the rules at the same time. When it comes to pure technical filmmaking craft, I give The Tree Of Life 5 stars out of 5. It's only the story and the writing (assuming there was much), that knocks this film down a start for me. But it wouldn't surprise me that if the ""secrets"" of this movie are revealed to me down the road, that I upgrade my score.

While I could go on and on talking about the details of this movie, I think it's best to let it speak for itself beyond what I've had to say so far. The ideas, lessons, questions, and queries that I think it poses can't really be talked about. I believe one has to internalize them like all philosophy, psychology, and spirituality. They're are no real answers in my mind from The Tree Of Life to the questions it asks. It's the questions that are the meat of it's meal.",1337817600,3,5205,4.537806176783812

4302924,4,B004A8ZX32,"Much of this film is made as if through the eyes of a young boy. Because of that, it is quite emotionally fraught and tension filled where the film technique exaggerates and distorts in ways familiar to the descendants of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, so that an attic room is a very narrow, forty foot high dark brown chamber with a small window at one end; the mother is filmed as an ethereal angel like figure, the father, a stiff, thick-lipped jaw-jutting fascist - a point of view familiar to almost all boys, and to Greek dramatists, Freudians etc. It reminds me that the great Huckleberry Finn is also a point of view work, where great truths are revealed through the eyes of a young boy.  The film is bookmarked by images of the natural world and highlights a reminder of our insignificant part in it. If it is the case that the world through the eyes of a boy, and his memory of it, are distorted by powerful feelings of love, shame, wonder, jealousy, guilt, fear, then Mr Mallick has managed to make a remarkable and powerful portrait of the world of post WW2 suburban America as one (universal) boy experienced it and a sobering reminder that our worlds are much more defined by our feelings than by any objective evidence. It is also a reminder of how close our dreams are to film. Brad Pitt plays the father and was one of the producers. Interesting to observe this actor grow and evolve.

4302961,5,B004A8ZX32,"so many reviews have been written pointing out the pro and cons of this film so all I want to do is share a couple of scenes I really enjoyed.

The Help Each Other scene.  This was about as moving and nostalgic of a sequence in all of cinema as there ever will be.  The camera work in this scene reminded me of a ballet.  And the intimate and playful communion of the Mother and three children was sublime as they race around the house and backyard.  Very spiritual indeed.  ""Help each other.  Love everyone.  Every leaf, every ray of light.  Forgive,"" whispers the Mother in poetic voice over as Angela Hewitt's recording of a Couperin piece is played in the background.

I also like the symbolism in the 'resurrection' sequence at the end.  Notice how there is a bride all decked in a wedding gown lying on a sort of deathbed and then suddenly she is standing shimmering in light in light as the wonderful camera flashes by her.  This reminded me of the Revelation of Jesus Christ (the last book of the Bible):

{21:2} And I, John, saw the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.
. . .
{21:9} And one of the seven Angels, those holding the bowls filled with the seven last afflictions, approached and spoke with me, saying: ""Come, and I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.""

Also someone else pointed out the reference in Revelation to the sea emptying its dead.  This is clear in the gathering of the families in the midst of the shallow sea.

Another thing I noticed is that in the 'resurrection' sequence the mother (Chastain) with the lovely green dress (green the symbol of life) suddenly turns her head and views the sun before the sky is darker. She moves her head and looks thoughtful as if she is being summoned in her heart and mind.  This is exactly what I think Malick intended.  The sun is clearly in the context of the whole movie a symbol for God who summons her at that moment.  Then a quick underwater shot is shown of her floating up to the surface (similar to the birth scene earlier in the movie).  This is a symbol for her spiritual rebirth.  Then her dress color changes to the light blue and of course she leaves in the procession from the house in a spectacular and memorable fashion.  An exultant crystalline walk toward the sun with arms raised in praise! Then she is as if assumed into the figurative sun and offers her own son who died young thus resolving her search established in the beginning of the film.

Then of course there are the unspeakably lovely childhood sequences with Holst's hymn to Dionysius.  Very affectionate.  Very good and humane all around.

When I was in the theater an older gentlemen was literally exalted at the last shot.  He shouted, ""That was very good!"" and began clapping.  Powerful, profound, humane, good, even very Christian.

Highly recommended. In the package you even get a digital copy which can be given to poor college students who own laptops :)  I gave mine to a young college student who I know from the coffee shop.  He said the movie truly changed his life.

Why not take a look at the number of reviews and see that there are about as many 1 star reviews as there are 5 star reviews (and lots of each) which makes it obvious this is one of those unique films some will LOVE and others will HATE.

That's fine with me, I don't mind if you hit that this review isn't helpful, because I strongly believe this is a masterpiece of American cinema. ""The Tree of Life"" is a story about how one family survives through grief and setbacks, told from the perspective of the eldest son. The film's cinematography is its greatest asset, the shots are like moving paintings and it's hard to turn away from the screen for fear you would miss one frame of this beautiful work. I recommend the film to people who want to see movies that are more artistic, and have a theme and message, rather than manufactured Hollywood formula. Nothing about this movie is formula. It's got a deep, resonating message that's worth the time and investment.

Another great thing about this movie are the performances by Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain. Both of them give convincing portrayals of the parents in the family. Pitt gives maybe his best performance of his career (other than Assassination of Jesse James by Coward Robert Ford) and Chastain should have been nominated for an Oscar in my opinion for her work in this movie.",1333584000,7,1243,4.808411214953271

4302999,5,B004A8ZX32,"Last year at the film festival in Cannes, all the talk seemed to be about Terrence Malick's new film THE TREE OF LIFE. In part this was due to the critics taking note of the movie and reviews ranged from one end of the scale to the other. But no one wanted to miss it. Perhaps that's because Malick is something different in Hollywood.

Since 1973 Malick has only released 5 films as a director and almost all of them have been critically acclaimed if not a huge financial success. And yet he continues to direct films and find studios to back him. Where some films that claim to be ""art films"" never deserve the attention they receive, Malick's films are more often than not something to witness. They are a visual and storytelling treat. Those films have included BADLANDS, DAYS OF HEAVEN, THE THIN RED LINE, THE NEW WORLD and now THE TREE OF LIFE. I usually find myself appreciating films like these but rarely enjoy them enough to watch again. This film changes that.

The story begins with the death of a brother to Jack (Sean Penn). Its effect on him isn't quite visible. Surely he is shaken but it makes him think back to other things, other days and growing up in the 1950s.

Brad Pitt plays Mr. O'Brien, Jack's father. Pitt's character is a strict disciplinarian but not without reason. He wants his children to grow up and be successful. This becomes even more important later in the film when he is forced to take on a different job. He feels its better to be your own boss than to work at the whim of someone else. His battles with life, his struggles, are imposed upon his three sons, especially Jack.

Jack's mother is the opposite of his father, a free spirit who sees joy in the world around her, who offers her children a sense of freedom in simply playing. Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) is a tender woman who loves her husband and her children with equal measure, but who wants her boys to experience life as opposed to just making a living and not experiencing things as simple as sunsets.

One would think that these two differing people would be hard pressed to find common ground. But the fact is that they are the yin and yang of these boys lives, the balance between reality and fantasy that should exist to make a person complete, to make them whole. And as the life Jack remembers fills the screen we see the three brothers in various forms through his eyes; his love of his brothers and at times his jealousy of them. We witness his admiration for his father but his fear of him as well. And we see his love for his mother that comes through at all times.

This is a coming of age story that shows a young boy grow up to be a man but without a major plot issue that makes it happen. It's not like someone dies or does drugs but a simple story of a boy. You recognize so much of what Jack goes through and experiences if you grew up during this time period or even the one after. Fireflies, bb guns and tying frogs to model rockets are just some of the crazy things kids do or did. And Jack and his brothers do it all.

But Malick wasn't content to leave it at that. We also have the story of Pitt's character, a man who struggles to do his best and yet considers himself a failure. In reality he hasn't failed he's just placed in a position where he can't achieve the goals he's set for himself. That day might come, but not as this story takes place. He is a man with wealth in the love of his wife and children who feels he is poor. And it is through his disappointment in himself that we see the bad side of family.

Malick is amazing in the images he turns up on film. What for most would be a humdrum neighborhood with little to see, Malick turns it into a feast for the eyes. You can almost feel the warm summer days when kids would play or do yard work here. And a sunset is rarely captured so brilliantly on film.

Added to this is a sequence that involves the creation of the world. It's an amazing thing to watch that would fit home in Epcot let alone in any film concerning the beginnings of life. The effects used and the footage that comes out is breathtakingly beautiful.

At just over 2 hours the movie may seem a tad long for some. While I watched though it passed the personal test I have for all movies: when it's really bad and if it moves to slow I just hang tight to the remote and move past the slow parts. Sorry but that's the truth. I never once felt the need to do so here.

THE TREE OF LIFE is a fantastic movie. It's one that I will keep on hand because I know I'll want to experience it again, finding new things to witness with each viewing. It's a movie that I think anyone with children will enjoy. And it's a treat for the eyes, the ears and the mind. In short, this is a great movie and deserving of all the credit and hype that surrounded its initial release. It deserves better than the short time it was on screens and needs to be discovered. With its release on DVD, now is the chance.",1332806400,6,4951,4.2507970244420825
4303000,3,B004A8ZX32,"""The Tree of Life"", which I recently caught on DVD, drops an epic sequence depicting no less than the creation of the universe and the rise and fall of the dinosaurs, smack dab into the middle of a serious drama covering the joys and tragedies of an American family from the 1950's to the present. I just wanted to warn you: yes, you're getting an Art film here, with a capital A.

Many of the individual sequences of the film are involving, well acted, and- in the case of the ""creation of the universe and all life on earth"" sequence- quite spectacular. But some may find the lack of a traditional story, and the way the disparate parts of the movie don't demonstrate obvious connections with one another, a little frustrating.

Myself, I admired more than enjoyed ""The Tree of Life"", and have no real desire to watch it again anytime soon. But I'm glad that movies like this can still get made, even if I found this particular movie to be a little dull at times. Anyway, maybe next year I'll check out the film again, after its images and juxtapositions have been percolating in my brain for a while, and see if I have any new impressions.

And, yeah, I already have some ideas about how the creation of the universe stuff ties into the scenes of Brad Pitt yelling at his kids in his backyard, but in the end they're just my ideas. You'll probably have your own. And if that's okay with you, you'll probably like the movie at least as much as I did. But if you prefer all your movies to clearly communicate what they're about, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one.

""The Tree of Life"" is available in all manner of formats for your home viewing pleasure.  I have to say that the standard DVD I watched looked and sounded terrific.",1332720000,2,1744,4.403726708074534
4303001,5,B004A8ZX32,"""Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth? When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?""

This verse of Scripture from the book of Job opens Terrence Malick's latest masterpiece, entitled The Tree of Life. After these words appear over a black screen and fade out into the darkness, a mysterious flame illuminates the center of the screen, followed by a distant voice which breaks the silence - ""Brother. Mother. It was they who led me to Your door.""

Thus begins the most beautiful and complex film that you are likely to see this decade. It is not a film in the traditional sense of the word. This is not a plot-driven film. What we have here is the journey of life in words and images - a prayer to God which questions His motives, which longs to understand Him, which calls upon Him, and yearns to be near Him at all times.

The film follows Jack O'Brien (Sean Penn) on the anniversary of his younger brother's death. Jack, a skilled architect, is disillusioned with the world around him. ""The world has gone to the dogs"", Jack ponders, as he stares blankly out of the window of a high-rise building. Jack leaves his office and prays to God - ""When did you first touch my heart?"" Almost immediately, we are whisked back and forth, through past, present, and beyond, to the creation of the galaxies and the Earth, to the brief reign of the dinosaurs, and the beginning of human existence, until, finally, we reach ""the end of time"".

Throughout the film, we revisit Jack's tormented childhood in rural Texas in the 1950s. We are introduced to his family, led by his parents (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain). His angelic mother teaches Jack and his two brothers the ways of grace (love, forgiveness), while his father represents the way of nature (selfishness, greed). These conflicting worldviews serve as a catalyst for Jack's spiritual and existential struggle, which drives the second act of the film.

Mind you, this synopsis does the film no justice. This film cannot be defined in simplistic terms, nor can it be categorized into any specific genre of film. This is a film that defies convention. It redefines the way that we experience cinema. It is alive, full of wonder and awe. It is poetry. As a friend of mine said after the first screening, this film is a force. It will be a different experience for each individual. You will get out of this film exactly what you bring to it. For me, it is quite possibly the most spiritually significant experience that I have ever had in a theatre. It allowed me to see God portrayed in a way that is respectful, unique and all-encompassing. The grace and mercy of God saturates every frame of this film. Every element - from the beautiful and haunting imagery, to the ethereal soundtrack, to the understated performances, to the philosophical musings on existence - works together in perfect harmony to create a work of art that you will never forget. The performances are uniformly excellent, and the direction from Terrence Malick is as perfect as ever. Not since Bergman has an artist tackled these complicated themes with such respect and originality.

This is the best film that I have ever seen.

Rated PG-13 for thematic elements. 139 minutes. ***** out of ***** Fox Searchlight Pictures. Directed by Terrence Malick.",1332374400,8,3327,4.716006884681583
4303002,4,B004A8ZX32,"I have not yet seen this film but I wanted to comment about one thing. I've read about the imagery, dinosaurs, the cosmos, etc, that is interspersed in the film. If you watch most any Malick film, you will see that he uses this, technique, for lack of a better description, in most if not all his films. In fact he is known for this. The thing that I have been left with after seeing some of his films is that this is a artistic watermark that tells you you are watching a Terrence Malick film.",1332201600,,494,4.15625
4303003,5,B004A8ZX32,"This is a problematic film for the uncommitted viewer.  It breaks away from most any narrative-structure known in big film in that it deals with one's perceptions of relationships and TIME--not time as in the duration it takes the hands of your watch to move round.  So, in a way, it's a most subjective enterprise whereby TIME is being observed from within, as times are recalled and/or being lived through.

The said relationships are those between Jack, the eldest son of a typical post-WWII American family, and his parents and brothers.  The front relation seems to be the one between Jack and his father(/Father?), the attendant relation is between Jack and a disappeared younger brother.  Throughout, Jacks discovers, and builds on, his relation with the big OUTSIDE one's senses. TIME consists of the remembered times when Jack grew up under his father's authority, besides his brothers, and of the running time of Jack's becoming.  Or, as Malick puts it, time of nature and time of grace, with love as the equalizer.

If we are to take apart Malick's film, there is a 3-part structure to it:  The 1st, which lasts until the mother receives the tragic news by mail, is that of the innocent period; The 2nd, until Jack's father admits being overwhelmed if not mistaken, and Jack the adult enters a door-frame into the desert, is a period of growing doubt and tension; The 3rd and final is the resolution.

The viewer gets exposed to a long series of beautiful and almost always meaningful shots, while being prompted to an acute awareness to the intensity of the moment.  In addition, Malick's fan club is taken to a new level as expressed by the musical form of this work.  Music becomes another character, this film is music.  Take your time and understand that Malick offers nothing less than a wise perspective on becoming and being, tune yourself to the harmony of life.",1332115200,4,1882,4.8105590062111805

4303008,3,B004A8ZX32,"This movie uses family as a theme on meditation about nature and grace.  As one of the protagonists in a movie says ""Nature just is, grace we accept.""  It is a film about a family in which three young boys grow up.  Their father is domineering and harsh in attempt to prepare them to the life of adulthood which is full of disappointments and failed hope.  As a head of the family, this father carries the responsibility of providing for his family the best he can.  He has pushed aside his true passion for music in order to devote his life to engineering that is supposed to bring financial stability to the family.  In spite of having 26 patents and never missing a day of work, after 14 years of working for the same company he finds himself forced to accept a job no one else wants in order to preserve his career and his job.  But these realities put pressure on this man who takes it out on his family - his wife and his three sons.

This movie is part fantasy, part meditation, part visual feast.  It is definitely not meant to please mass audiences.  It is digging deep into human psyche and it explores how we, as human beings, turn out to be the way we are.  What part of us in innate, what part of ourselves we inherit from our parents and our surroundings, what part of our life experiences molds us into who we are?  There are moments when this film turns into visual masterpiece.  However, the narrative side of it diminishes great potential this film could have had.

4303011,2,B004A8ZX32,"While the artistic merits of this film can't be ignored or denied, the rest of it is truly a waste. I wanted to shut it off after about 20 minutes, and I have a very high annoyance tolerance for films. Visually, it is stunning but combined with a non-linear story-line, an odd plot and wasted acting, The Tree of Life is simply a bore. You can't even really summarize this film properly. During the 50's three sons are seen growing up in a typical home with a somewhat strict (but not bad) father and now, in present day, the eldest reflects on his sad past. Why is he so angry and resentful? Who knows, because the mere glimpses we get are not nearly enough to establish anything. Sean Penn plays the modern day son and I'm pretty sure he doesn't utter a single word in the entire movie except a random whisper to the viewers. In fact, I read recently that while he was on set, he had no idea what he was even doing there because he apparently didn't know what the point of his role was... Brad Pitt plays the 'stern' father back in the past (and does a marvelous job actually) but again, his character is never fully fleshed out so we only get a surface picture of him. Jessica Chastain is the mother, who wanders the film aimlessly, loving her boys and husband, but never speaking a word of importance. She does love washing her feet alot though...... There's also alot of whispering in the movie.

The one redeaming factor is the beautifully haunting score. I didn't realize until the credits that Alexandre Desplat conducted this. He is my new favorite composer after hearing his work in other recent films. It really is a glorious and noticable score and I only wish the actual film could keep up with it. At well over 2 hours, it was hard not to fidget and constantly check the time. The ending was just....odd. But by that point I was so past caring I didn't even try to break it apart frame by frame like I usually like to do. This is not a fantasy(or is it??) but it does contain dinosaurs. Like I said; odd.

4303012,2,B004A8ZX32,"Malick's Tree of Life exemplifies the director's arrogance for his movies. It is apparent during the long drawn out segments of the history of the universe and of Earth that Malick believes he can simply ignore plot, immersion, and interest to try to get his philosophical and artistic ideas onto the screen. However, I give this review 2 stars, not one, because there are some redeeming parts in the middle of the film where he ceases to be artistic and focuses more on the character development and family structure which actually mimics Malick's own upbringing. Perhaps this would have been better as a short, 45-minute film, but instead any semblance of a good movie is lost in philosophical nonsense which simply alienates the viewer.",1330905600,2,739,4.967741935483871
4303013,4,B004A8ZX32,"The Tree of Life ironically deals with the topic of death. The film tells you to turn up the sound so you can hear all the first person narration. When their son dies at the age of 19 parents cope with the loss and question their faith, but not severely question their faith that would alter their life style. After the characters are introduced, we still see Sean Penn doesn't own a comb. The film digresses into a Discovery Channel special which condenses the modern version of creation of 14.7 billion years into about 12 minutes. I felt like we had passed into the monolith.

We now start all over with the birth of the children. Hey, we already know one dies. There are things that are whispered. These are meant to be ideas or questions for God. Brad Pitt metaphorically represents the ""tough love"" God who prepares us for life's journey without us realizing it. Hence we have the macrocosm and microcosm in our tale. One could assume that the microcosm of our life is reflective of our theological views, we carve out a tough love God based upon our tough love ""Father"". At one point in the movie Brad Pitt insists his son call him ""Father"" and never ""Dad."" Having lived in the south, that is a no-no. ""Father"" is reserved for the heavenly Father. That is a hint of the symbolism. A sermon stresses the book of Job and asks, ""Is the scheme of life a fraud?""

Not for everyone. I was very bored until I figured out what they were attempting to do. I think the beauty of the film is that different people can grasp a different meaning from it. It doesn't spell it out. My review is one take.",1330819200,,1596,4.406779661016949
4303014,5,B004A8ZX32,"Like many of the reviewers before me, I will say that The Tree of Life is not a conventional film. Don't go in expecting to escape because it won't let you.  The Tree of Life is a movie that forces you to think, to evaluate, and to question. When watching you must be engaged, analyzing the story and analyzing yourself. Don't go in thinking you'll be able to close your mind off because you won't be able to.  That is the beauty of the film.

Hinging on ideas of spirituality and philosophy, The Tree of Life asks questions about the role of God and the role of man.  In a masterpiece of cinematography, writing, and acting, The Tree of Life causes you analyze your beliefs and the path of your life. Do you follow the way of nature or the way of grace?

This is my first Terrence Malick film and I plan on watching more.  I honestly believe Malick is a film making genius.  In a grand array of stunningly beautiful imagery and intellectualism, The Tree of Life is one of the deepest and most breathtaking films I have ever seen.  Never before have I been moved at the lengths I was when I first saw Tree of Life.

She is inquisitive, celebratory, gentle, lovely, free and loving; all the things that personify grace, all because it is in her nature to be that way. The father is ""nature"", which signifies human nature, and is unhappy, disappointed, angry, dull, harsh, enslaved, with occasional bouts of gentleness and love, all because it is in his nature to be that way. In the middle of the both of those things is God's sovereignty; in creation, birth, death, love, tragedy, happiness, calling; all of it. So ultimately I think the movie is from God's perspective; how He views creation and the dance or grace & nature. And who are we to question it (appropriate quote from Job)?

This idea of God's sovereignty may not sit well with you. The idea of the Christian worldview may not sit well with you. The perceived nod to evolution may not sit with you. The long, impressionistic flow of the film may not sit well with you. The fact that Pitt and Penn are the stars may not sit well with you.

If any of these are the case, here is your challenge. Put those things aside and plan to spend 2 hours to consider God, His sovereignty over human events, creation and the great dance of grace and nature (human nature). It will be 2 hours well spent.",1330560000,5,1765,4.4079754601226995

The story focuses on three young boys going up in 1950's under the strict ruling of their father.

Is it any good?

Recipe for a Terrace Malick film:
A. Low voice over, which you will need to turn the volume up for.
B. Highly visual, with emphasis on detail and nature.
C. Individual shots that linger much longer than what an MTV generation would be used to.
D. A 120 min + run time, which after it ends will have you deep in thought for day after end.

Know what you are going to get when seeing a Terrace Malick film, and you will appreciate his films much more. Tree of Life is epic in scope and vision, but unfortunately, does waver a bit regarding the story. Probably not Malick's best, but still a beautiful and haunting film, that is absolutely worth watching just to celebrate techniques of a master craftsman.

Best bit?

4303050,4,B004A8ZX32,"After watching the movie, I can understand why it was nominated for an Oscar, but I can also understand why it's had such a negative commercial response.

Every scene is visually stunning, especially the footage of natural phenomena.

Acting was great by all parties involved, but I want to specially recognize the main boy actor, who transformed from an innocent, mischievous child to an malicious, angsty teen, torn between the innocence he knew as a child (represented by his mother) and the realities of adulthood (represented by his father). His expressions and movements embodied a mix of guilt, confusion, happiness, anger, etc. at all times. His younger brother was also a great child actor. Completely innocent and resolutely choosing the to do the right thing, not out of naivety, but because he's comfortable with giving up the top dog position for a life of grace.

The director also did a fantastic job of creating a certain transcendental ambience through lighting, the soundtrack,  and whispered prayers throughout the movie.

HOWEVER, to be honest, I wondered if all the fanciness was necessary. It felt a little overdramatic at times, but I think it's just a matter of personal taste. It can feel a bit slow though, especially for people looking for more plot-driven movies,  but otherwise the content and the form of the movie were great.",1330387200,,1356,5.03125

Second, I'm not a touchy-feel y bleeding heart person and really am mostly logical, not very emotional in my reaction to things. I do love music and do feel the emotion in its many forms and this is my favorite of all time. The visuals in this movie blew me away and then to add the music moved me in ways I didn't know existed. I do love a good movie and this is my all time favorite. As a mom I felt the pain and sweetness that only a mother could know. As a wife I understood the fracturing of feelings from father and child and complicated loyalty that the mother has to remain consistent with. What Terrance Malic was able to convey in this film was nothing of short brilliant. To those who can't get past the first 1/3, I'm very sorry. My 23yr old son and his friends all watched it with me and the reviews were very polarized. My son (apples falling close to trees:)) loved it and it made him want to one day be a father who shows love much different than the one in the film (although the character  does love his family, he is unable to connect deeply and in ways that they need). A couple friends fell asleep and one just thought that it was terribly boring and didn't think it had a plot. I just smiled and felt pity for the poor fellow- a great guy anyway!

Immediately after the film, if you can call it that, someone told me she was going to start a support group for people who saw this movie. Another person said it was 2 hours of his life he'll never get back. This was in a theatre that shows these types of ""artsy"" movies exclusively.

No other movie has tried this blatantly to equate humankind's actions to the majesty of the universe. Malick argues many monumental things, but among them some of the more important statements emerge. The story does not happen on screen, in this movie. Not even its important punctuations do; what would traditionally be called the small moments in between, the repercussions, are what we see on screen. What does this mean? It means stories, and events, are no more important than their consequences, that every moment is as important as the moments we usually think of as important. On this note, what does he mean by cutting between these tiny fragments of life and the epic of evolution and the universe? He means, first of all, to remind us of where we live. Most people, I believe, don't remember this very often: they don't recognize the constant, insane scale of the universe they are in, and I don't just mean ""you're a tiny dot in a vast universe."" I don't mean you are insignificant, and neither does Malick. I mean that you are very significant, you are one of the relative infinity of forces, and because of the nature of your existence, you tend to forget a vast majority of the other forces of which, in fact, you are a part, every single day. I mean that you probably haven't actually empathized (not sympathized) with a dinosaur before; but watching this, you might. Why, Malick asks you, do you need a traditional story to understand people, or moments, or sentiments? This is largely paralleling the story of Job, and going by that notion, Malick argues that what might be the most important part of your existence is your response, not your action. You are one force among many: how will you control your fate, when you can, how you can? These, among many many others, are the questions that Malick attempts to answer, with eye-gouging beauty and an endless boon of technical sophistication.

The only, *only* thing I wanted less of was some (only SOME) of Jessica Chastain's character's few-phrase overlays of narration. Some of them were way over the top and unnecessary, even though the whole film is kind of based on being unabashedly emotional, which may be why Malick kept all of the lines he did. In contrast, some of her lines were perfect, and even necessary, as when she asks ""Lord, Why? Where were you? Did you know what happened? Do you care?"" This perfectly segues us into Malick's response, and the most astounding centerpiece of the movie, the evolutionary sequence, wrapping it all together. Beyond this, as a muse, as both an untouchable thing of stunning beauty and a housewife, Jessica Chastain fills the role perfectly. And besides, quibbling about this one bit is like quibbling with James Joyce that I didn't like some of his paragraphs of wordplay in the Lotos Eaters episode of ""Ulysses."" It just doesn't matter in the scheme of the whole work.

Many are bothered because they think this movie is pretentious. In modern society there is an epidemic of misplaced derision: people scorn pretension more often than they scorn mediocrity or even failure. Certainly, pretension has done less damage than the failure and mediocrity which is currently ravaging, but of course which always has ravaged, society. But here, as in many cases, pretension is hand in hand with insane talent. In fact, I would only call this pretentious to those without a thorough experience in the world of film, that is, without having seen thousands of past films, mostly, of course, the better films, but the bad ones too. Actually, this movie is not pretentious but unashamed, embarrassingly honest and indulgent.

I should add that I am saying this as a 25 year old, not an old curmudgeon who is angry at the world.

To those who wonder what I mean by film experience. For some of those who are saying they have this experience, I mean, sure, maybe you've seen plenty of ""arthouse"" and ""indie"" movies, but have you covered the decades and movements of varied types of film? Have you seen movies that make you rework your understanding of what a movie could be, that make you doubt your previous definition that a movie has to be a straightforward narrative of audio and image where the entire plot, easy-peasy, is put right up on the screen, and you don't need to do any work at all? That's one difference between book and film, even some of the best films don't make you do any of the work, don't require you to parse trough information, instead feeding it all to you. I don't mean they don't make you think--the Godfather, for example, will make you think, to varying degrees that depend on your intelligence, but it does not require you to think to figure it out. If you respond by saying that you don't think one should have to think hard to figure out a movie, I say: that is the kind of mind you have, or that is the decision you've made on how to use your mind, and it's not as rewarding, period. A little hard work, or even a lot of hard work, is worth it--art is not here merely to please you, it's also here to change you, if you want it to--people get spiteful, thinking they're being tricked, but believe me, Malick would not even begin to consider putting the time or effort into making this in order to trick you. The same goes for Ulysses, a book often accused of being 800 pages of BS. Would Joyce, undoubtedly a genius, but at the very least certainly no fool, spend over 7 years just to screw with readers? Returning to those who may or may not have ""seen plenty of art films"", &c: Have you taken the time to watch what astounding things people have done in the medium of film already, and what important changes and revolutionary techniques have been employed by, beginning very early on, Melies, Bunuel and Salvador Dali, Fritz Lang, von Stroheim, Godard, Truffaut, Kurosawa, Bergman, Ozu, Kubrick, Fassbiner, Herzog, Wong Kar Wai, Andrei Tarkovsky, Elem Klimov, and countless others? I am not discounting mainstream American directors-- I love Scorcese, Coppola, Peckinpah, Tarantino, Fincher, the Cohen Brothers, etc. etc. I'm just saying, a lot more than you might think has been done in film, and you should check it out before you try to make an informed decision, not to mention write a review, about unusual movies like this one that sneak into mainstream audiences who would never otherwise watch such a film. Of course, for plenty of people, the answer to my above question is yes you have seen these things, and I'm glad, but I would also bet my (tiny as it is) fortune on it that if you have seen these things, you like The Tree of Life.

Malick has worked for decades, starting relatively simply with ""Badlands"" and ""Days of Heaven"" (relative to this movie and ""The New World"") and moving into the ether-- very deservedly so. Kubrick, who is I think ultimately the better filmmaker, made his magnum opus (the masterpiece of his many masterpieces) just over ten years into his career. Malick, in contrast, waited four decades. We could fairly say that Kubrick had much more exposure by actually continually making films, versus Malick, who let time and maturity do a lot of the work, and made films sporadically (although he seems to have returned to regularity [although, of course, this film seems like a career final film, if any film ever has]). What this contrast shows to me is the slightly higher level of raw talent in Kubrick. Still, knowing Malick, and what he has done in the past, it is very clear that he is not ""trying hard"" to make film-art-- it flows through him like poetry did through Keats. Which isn't to say that it flows and is produced without discipline or practice, but just that it is THERE, fully and truly, and that he masterfully harnesses it. Watch this movie, if you're ready, if you're interested in your life, and interested in the life of the universe. Which is your life too.",1330300800,4,8137,4.686713286713287

4303082,5,B004A8ZX32,"What a beautiful film. This is a real gem, and it reminds me of ""2001 Space Odyssey"" in its scope. But I always thought that Space Odyssey was faux profound, as if it was trying to say something with depth and meaning about human existence and alienation, but it couldn't. This movie is much more successfully profound, because it has a religious and even theological dimension to it. References and appeals to divinity, to transcendent love, knowledge, and truth, has through the ages effectively evoked mystery, meaning, and magnitude to mankind.

For this director, as perhaps that of Space Odyssey, the starting point for understanding and redeeming those aspects of human existence which are bewildering or painful is the contemplation of creation itself - of its age, weight, immensity, grandeur, power, remoteness, beauty, and fragility. As humans, with specific problems and specific pains (some mature and objectively heavy, others immature and subjectively petty), we have the opportunity to lose ourselves in the very stuff of our existence - our environment - which at once seems to sympathize with and also minimize our momentary angst. It think this is part of the reason why the director needed a very ordinary, particular historical setting and prosaic characters with which to set them against the awesome, impersonal scope of creation.

I still think the film will be disorienting to many, but Christians have an advantage right off if they know their Bible well. ""Tree of Life"" begins with a quote from the book of Job: ""Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? (Job 38: 4,7)."" Job is in pain, and he has questioned God's goodness and justice. He has begged (as many characters in the movie also did), ""Where were you?"" The larger issue here is how it is possible that a personal and good God could allow humans to suffer, either physically or spiritually. Why should they be allowed to struggle, to sin, to lose their way? God's counter question is powerful but difficult to accept: ""Where were you when I created the universe?"" It does not seem like a relevant or comforting answer.

There are a lot of movie goers who did not understand the lengthy interruptions in ""Tree of Life"" which portrayed the creation of the universe. They probably asked ""How on earth is this relevant?"" But that is exactly the point of Job, and it is the point of this film. There are no easy answers here, and ""Tree of Life"" wisely avoids the predictable platitudes.",1330128000,4,2560,4.86697247706422

""Guide us.

""Till the end of time.""

These words come whispered, hushed, at a key moment in Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life""; we hear these words spoken as the universe itself flickers into oblivion. Clearly these words are the words of prayer, but they sound not like the prayer of petitioning but rather more meditative, as if the speaker already believes in everything sacred, as if the spirit voicing these thoughts already knows that guidance is given, eternally.

For those without the imagination or faith to embrace such a moment, Malick's film will be tedious, meaningless, perhaps even infuriating. For anyone, though, with even a shred of religious feeling, ""The Tree of Life"" could stand as one of the greatest films ever made. Yet it requires no dogma, no denomination; if you haven't set foot in church in twenty years, still it will move you if you allow it.

Malick has done many fine things with this movie, which is so unlike any sort of traditional Hollywood film that it's hard to believe it got made. It's almost impossible to find a comparison, though one does come to mind: Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" For ""Tree,"" Malick coaxed ""2001"" special effects genius Douglas Trumbull out of retirement. The scenes of the universe, and of life developing on Earth, are so stunning and beautiful they will bring tears ... and will remind the careful viewer of the visuals Trumbull helped create for Kubrick.

Yet while Kubrick's prime concern in ""2001"" was the human intellect, Malick's is the human soul. I am not one of the people who find Kubrick cold; I think his films inspire awe, but I have to agree that Malick has a different tilt.

Put simply, the plot description seems so mundane: A boy remembers growing up in the 1950s as his father struggled to make a mark for himself and his mother struggled to emphasize to her sons that ""making a living"" isn't nearly as important as ... LIVING. Yet Malick has placed this simple story in such a grand frame that it becomes much more than just the story of a few individuals. The conflict between cruel nature and the state of grace ends up applying to everything in creation. Water and rock, earth and sky, creatures ranging from dinosaur to human ... All is in motion, and nature and grace are at work constantly.

This is a superb, searching film that dares delve into the very bedrock of existence. Certainly it asks more questions than it answers, but great art does that.",1330128000,5,2471,4.716937354988399
4303085,5,B004A8ZX32,"""The Tree of Life"" is a brilliant new form of cinematic art and a masterpiece by director, Terrence Malik.

The best way to appreciate the film is to flow with the imagery and drop all expectations of a conventional narrative. This is cinematic poetry, passionate and true, that is richly layered with the euphoria of human experience.

The premiere of ""The Tree of Life"" at the Cannes film festival last year hauntingly echoed, in a way, the premiere of Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring."" Now considered a magnum opus, Stravinsky's towering work caused a near riot when it was first performed; and at Cannes, the boos and hisses during the first showing of ""The Tree of Life"" were punctuated by intermittent cries of ""Genius!"" Isn't it interesting how so much dissension is generated by anything deemed ""different?""

I scanned the scathing reviews posted here and was saddened but not surprised. Most people would rather worship the sterile conformity that feeds our consumeristic nation than step outside the feeding frenzy and savor a new and startling flavor. I wonder how art will continue to survive in a world where its occupants are so tragically losing their ability to see and hear. In an artistic sense it is like Puritanism come full circle, where a creative act of staggering originality incites a witch hunt.

""The Tree of Life"" is ""The Rite of Spring"" of cinema. You may feel ambivalent about it -- or even hate it -- but like other great works from the past that were once maligned and misunderstood at first, I predict ""The Tree of Life"" will reveal its brilliance with age and become a film classic.",1330041600,4,1613,4.812274368231047
4303086,4,B004A8ZX32,"The Tree of Life is the latest film by reclusive director Terrence Malick (Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line) whose previous films displayed a simple narrative abetted by haunting imagery.  This film takes a step further by telling its story in grand strokes of imagery.  Though its technique may lead some to wonder the point of this exercise and dismiss it as confusing, others will hail it an ambitious masterwork.  Let the viewer beware.

One family deals with a personal loss as it ponders the meaning of life through the point of view of its oldest son (Sean Penn), now an adult in the business world.  Celestial forces of nature signal the very creation and existence of the universe and provide a majestic background to the birth and evolution of life on earth.  We witness the beginnings of an American family from the Midwest in mid-twentieth century.  Led by a stern, proud father (Brad Pitt), and a doting mother (Jessica Chastain), three sons experience the joys and pains of growing up.  Through a rapid series of short scenes, this tapestry of sounds and images forms a mosaic of life's precious moments.  All the while a voice asks the great questions of life and God.

Certainly the most ambitious film in the enigmatic director's career, it is also the most challenging.  This is pure cinema, and it is remarkable how the film is able to communicate visually albeit without much in the way of lengthy dialogue.  These fragments of life almost seem surreal as if from a Fellini film.  In a way it is kind of an experimental film on a grand scale.  It seems to ask, `what is the purpose of existence amid great loss'?  (Despite being a very spiritual film, creationists might not like the premise of some of the scenes that strongly suggest an evolutionary development of life on earth.)

Those who are able to decipher the abstract nature of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey will likely have a clue on how to access the style and meaning of this film.  Indeed, some of the impressive visuals were created by Douglas Trumbull (Blade Runner) who did the 2001 special visual effects and helped to realize Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has captured some stunning visuals of landscapes and life that are at times overwhelming in their beauty.  The musical score alternates between classical and operatic pieces although one almost expects a minimalist, Philip Glass-type score to pop up.

There are many unanswered questions. Which brother died and how? And what is the background of the oldest brother as adult?  How has the father changed since the loss of his son and how does this affect the family?  As much as the oldest son asks for answers, we want more information and must settle for pieces from a larger puzzle.

The film serves as a search for meaning and hope amid the vastness of existence.  As we see the father teach his sons about manners, chores, music, fighting, and death, we may see something in our own common, shared experiences. Life is portrayed as a series of events that sometimes blur over time.

This exploration of the meaning of life may prove to be too abstract and a turn off for some, but to those who are open to a visual experience unlike any other, it may prove to be a fascinating exercise in pure cinema.  Kubrick would be proud.",1330041600,5,3330,4.729636048526863

But be warned. The Tree of Life does not have a linear narrative, and doesn't tell a story as much as it shows it. And the regular viewer--that is, most of us--, used to be told in images and words what we are supposed to see and feel, may find this story hard to follow.

The movie starts with a flaming light and a quotation from the Book of Job: ""Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation...while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?""

Then we are shown a woman (Jessica Chastain) as she learns in a letter the death of her son, age 19. In her grief and despair, enhanced by the absence of sound in the subsequent images, the mother questions God's design in such a seemingly cruel act.

From here, the movie proceeds in two alternating levels. One shows the creation of the universe, the gathering of dust that made the planets, the apparition of microscopic life, scenes from the time of the dinosaurs and the destruction of most life on Earth as a consequence of a meteor hitting our planet.

In another level we are shown images from the life of a contemporary middle aged man (Sean Penn): his birth in the 1950s to a loving mother (Jessica Chastain), his growing up in Texas under a strict father (Brad Pitt), his rebellion as an adolescent and his relationship with his two younger brothers. The second, the one he is closer to, will die later at 19 as we learned at the beginning of the movie.

The story unfolds in pieces and bits, the way our memory works: some scenes from our past are vividly clear while others are lost. The overall picture that unfolds is both that of a unique human being and an universal story.

If the movie sounds dreadfully boring, it's my fault. The Tree of Life maybe slow but it's never boring.

So, in conclusion, if you want an adrenaline rush, a fast moving thriller or a light comedy, don't watch The Tree of Life. But if you want to take a break from a too stressful life and step in a world made out of memories and dreams. If you are ready to be moved and awed and inspired, then this movie is perfect for you.",1329436800,298,2293,4.303944315545244

Don't waste your time or your money. I don't mind a movie that makes you think, but all this movie did was made me think of drugs, just so I could get through it. This director tried to be artistic and avant-garde, and yes, there is some nice imagery in the film and cinematography, but that alone cannot carry the weight of a movie and this movie misses its mark by a long shot. It's supposed to be teaching a lesson about life, faith and spirituality I suppose, but is far too fragmented to reach that goal. There were never any kind of conclusions or resolutions, and even stars like Brad Pitt and Sean Penn could not rescue this film from its abysmal failings to bring about its points.

4303137,2,B004A8ZX32,"The part of the film which resonated the most for me was the middle part, the part which felt most auto-biographical. I thought Malick captured what it was like to grow up as a youngster in the 50's in Texas, and a son's frustration at not being able to satisfy his demanding father. I thought the performances of Pitt and his eldest son were terrific, although being a musician myself, it was a stretch believing Pitt to be an ill-fated concert organist.

Unfortunately, the rest of the film did not resonate for me, both emotionally and intellectually. The philosophical ideas seem superimposed rather than integrated into the whole. It was as if the director felt compelled to resort to a philosophical overlay to make sense of a troubled youth, a tragic family experience - denying a personal, internal pain by rationalizing it. This rationalization and the sections of the film relating to philosophical ideas, either individually or collectively, to the central part of the film, feel weak.  What might have been a small film of grace and wonderment becomes a film of grandiose arrogance - an empty philosophical tract, a 'given' which is never earned. The philosophical part of the endeavor is meant to make one awe-struck.  But Malick's didactical approach ultimately makes the film feel inflated, rather than enlightened (but the latter is obviously intended).  A lack of artistic self-awareness comes to mind when describing Malick's work in general.

Aside from this, montage can succeed at inducing an idea, an act. If a director is clever enough, over long stretches of film time, he can induce the viewer to connect the dots. In this film, the dots remain disconnected.

Malick can be commended for his ambition - not for his failure.",1329350400,10,1748,4.969178082191781

The story of Job with the ultimate represented by the whirlwind seems to be the crux of The Tree of Life.  Our personal tragedies can become the focus of our attention to the exclusion of the vast and profound mystery of creation, which is always there and always awesome.  Life with its intense suffering requires levels of detachment.  That is not the same as numbness.  Suffering is too real to be ignored and would become the source of a pathology if it was.  But how does one balance an open, active and vulnerable participation in a life filled with loss and suffering?

4303141,2,B004A8ZX32,"As many reviewers have pointed out, much of Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"" plays out as an apparent homage to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  It uses similar sweeping visuals of the cosmos and the earthen landscape, a similar narrative structure, similar use of classical music.  Kubrick's opening showed us the dawn of man; Malick's opening shows us the evolution of life, leading us to the central story about a young family in the 1950's.  It is here that Malick's attempt to replicate Kubrick's masterpiece quickly begins to fall apart.

When Bowman, Poole, and the HAL 9000 set off aboard the Discovery One in Kubrick's film, they were going - to borrow from ""Star Trek"" - where no man had gone before.  When ""Tree of Life"" takes us inside the lives of a borderline dysfunctional family, we are traveling over very familiar territory.  Consequently, Malick's attempt to tell his story on such a grand scale seems awkward and forced.  His canvas here is simply too big.

And there are other problems.  The jumpy hand-held cinematography, fine for music videos or other short subjects, is - over a running time of well over two hours - exhausting to the viewer.  The sparse dialogue and hushed monotones, used in ""2001"" to convey the fear and loneliness of traveling in space, seem to have no real purpose in Malick's film other than to perhaps suggest the disconnection that these family members have to each other.

In the end, what ""The Tree of Life"" does is attempt to show us the human family - all of its joys, struggles, loves, losses and regrets - through the widest possible lens and as an answer, I suppose, for the meaning of life.  It is a film that ultimately fails by trying to model itself after a science fiction masterpiece rather than choosing a simpler and more user-friendly approach.",1329091200,5,1825,4.777070063694268

4303144,5,B004A8ZX32,"I stand confidently in the ""I loved it"" side of the room on ""The Tree of Life.""

The cinematography by Emmanual Lubezski is spectacular.  I'll agree with someone else who commented that you could hit pause at any moment in ""The Tree of Life"" and you'd have an image worthy of framing.  But I loved the movement of the camera which seemed to go from one extraordinary angle to another throughout nearly every scene.  There was more than one love affair going on in this film.  Perhaps the cinematographers love of morning light was one of the most powerful.

Jessica Chastain was magnificent.  This film gives the viewer every opportunity to relate to one or more of the characters for whatever reasons appeal to them an a personal, emotional basis.  I related to the young man and his struggles with identity.  But if I shed a tear at the end, it was because of how badly I miss my own mother, who for me, was so gracefully portrayed by Ms. Chastain.  Chastain's performance is the reason this movie reached my heart, and why I was so willing to embrace all its fundamental ambiguity with curiosity and enthusiasm.

In the movie, Jessica Chastain's performance was challenged by the relative lack of audio recording. So many of the scenes were filmed in a way where the ephemeral methods employed by the director and cinematographer meant that there would be no dialogue.  It seemed to me in these scenes Ms. Chastain was the most brilliant.

I might have changed the balance a little bit - less dinosaur, astrophysics and young male acting out, with a little bit more development of the other two brothers, of Mom's reality, and of the older brother (Penn) later in his life.  However, given that the story has its roots in the biblical story of Job, I thought it was somewhat clever (smile) that the screenplay has so much ""pre-"" historic scenes that were decidedly un-creationist!  Perhaps in exchange for some dinosaur action, in keeping with the grace of this film, more footage of ancient rainforest (rain), savannah (wind), or desert (heat) would have been nice to reinforce the ""grace"" of ""nature."" Anyway, I wonder if the evolutionary implications of some of the prehistoric scenes is why so many people, many who have never written reviews before, have logged into Amazon to write as many one or two sentence one star reviews as possible, and/or do as much damage as possible to the positive reviews for ""The Tree of Life.""  Were they offended on a religious level?  Was the mysterious crystalline light in the background of some of the dark screens not enough divine symbolism?

We are our memories.  My perfect genetic clone is not me because he has none of my memories.  I completely enjoyed the way Malick portrayal memory in ""The Tree of Life.""  Short clips.  Varying amounts of sound.  Unconventional perspectives.  Varying speed.  All kinds of light - in this movie light is used like an artists tool, whether it is brilliant morning light, fire, candles, interior filtered light, etc. Many of the scenes have no sound.  I can only imagine the amount of work that went into the preparations for shooting for the all the individual scenes.

Right now I am thinking about Mrs. O'Brien with her son at a river.  They have their backs to us and there is a light evening breeze.  They are sheltering something with a bright fire light in their hands.  There are extraordinary moments in my life that I recall like this.  Others have criticized Malick's art.  I totally embrace it and look forward to tracking down more of it.

I have one question I would ask Mr Malick if I could: it seems so many of the artists who contributed to this film (actors, camera, scenery, animation and special effects included) contributed their art in a way that was entirely consistent with the overall theme and character of the movie.  I wonder how much of this is Malick's heavy directing hand, and how much of this was the artists who embraced the theme free to explore their art under the general light touch of Malick.  In any event, the collection of artists added so much to the overall richness of the end product.  A wonderful example of this is the music by Alexandre Desplat. I am a great fan of rich, emotional and melancholy music that is powerful yet does not force the listener toward a specific conclusion because of its modest ambiguity.

Taken as a whole, ""The Tree of Life"" stands out for me as a very important and worthy film because of its entirely unconventional and effective approach to the visual art of story telling.",1328918400,6,4539,4.7

If you are a fan of Malick, or if you are willing to stop trying to analyze and interpret what you are seeing, if you're willing to look at what Malick shows you without trying to hold on to it - if you stop trying to make it into a secret code with some hidden meaning, this film can move you profoundly and deeply.  If you're just looking for a Brad Pitt family drama, or all you care about are trite and easily summarized and interpreted allegories and themes, this is not the film for you.  I'm usually more articulate, but this film defies rationalistic commentary, and the more you limit it to linguistic discourse the more you lose what the film is communicating, if that makes any sense at all.  I guess that's the point: this film makes no sense, because it rejects the very notion of ""sense.""  Another way I might phrase this is that this film, like all of Malick's films, but to an even greater degree, is an attempt to directly convey emotional states without first translating those emotions into abstract formulations; it does this through a combination of sensory stimuli instead of commentary, dialogue, discourse, etc.  It's more akin to a haiku, or an abstract painting than representational art - which of course is the mode to which we are accustomed in film.  I think this provokes a highly negative reaction in many.  I'll stop now before I get completely weird.

If you hated the film, give it some time and thought - and I bet if you hated it the first time you saw it, you're still thinking about it, still seeing the images and hearing the voiceovers and music.  Give it another chance.  Often, we are exposed to art before we are ready for it, when we're unprepared, and upon returning to it have a far more positive experience.  I had a very similar experience with ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" hating it vehemently when I first saw it, and upon being coerced into a second viewing completely reversed my opinion, and was embarrassed by the vitriol I had expended in condemning it.  So, if you hated ""Tree of Life,"" give it another watch.

Bottom line, turn off your cold rationalistic tendencies, and see this film with an open mind and open heart.

4303168,3,B004A8ZX32,"THE TREE OF LIFE was released in U.S. movie theatres at the end of May 2011. It came about the same time as the movie BRIDESMAIDS. I know this because I was an extra in a car commercial at the time and several of the female extras on the set were talking about which movie they were going to see that weekend and I heard many comments like, ""Yeah, I've heard good things about BRIDESMAIDS and THE TREE OF LIFE, so I don't know which one to see."" I didn't say so aloud, but when I heard these comments, I wanted to tell these women, ""If you're debating between watching BRIDESMAIDS and THE TREE OF LIFE, then you need to go see BRIDESMAIDS because THE TREE OF LIFE is not a movie you will enjoy."" I'm pretty sure that most of the women went to see BRIDESMAIDS and that the only reason they were mentioning THE TREE OF LIFE is because they wanted to seem like they knew something more about film than they really did because THE TREE OF LIFE had won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's directed by Terrence Malick.

THE TREE OF LIFE is a Terrence Malick film. That's something you need to know because Terrence Malick films aren't like other movies. Terrence Malick films are stunning works of cinematography and visual art. In that regard, they are incomparable and people who are serious about film often like them solely for that aspect. Terrence Malick films also usually have beautiful musical scores and if you were able to turn the dialog off and just listen to the film's music with the film's visuals, you'd have an amazing visual musical combination. It is largely because of these two things that Malick is considered a genius.

However, Terrence Malick films aren't like other films, so in addition to gorgeous cinematography and moving musical scores they also really don't have much of a plot. For instance, THE THIN RED LINE is about WWII, but it's unlike any war movie you'll ever watch again. THE NEW WORLD is supposed to be a love story between John Smith and Pocahontas, but if you watch it for romance or action, you'll be bored out of your mind.

If you know all of this ahead of time and you still haven't been turned off by it, you might enjoy THE TREE OF LIFE.

The film revolves around Jack O'Brien, portrayed as an adult by Sean Penn and as a child by Hunter McCracken. Flashing back and forth between the present and the past (and possibly the future), Jack wrestles with an internal struggle as illustrated by a line from Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Castain), ""The nuns taught us there were two ways through life - the way of nature and the way of grace. You have to choose which one you'll follow."" Jack had to decide as a boy becoming a man which path he would follow and as an adult it is a choice he has to make everyday.

In addition to those already mentioned, THE TREE OF LIFE features Brad Pitt in the role of Mr. O'Brien. Pitt makes a great 1950s father. He's got the look and moves down perfect and reminded me of old 8mm films of my own grandfather.
The movie has some dinosaurs which is pretty cool, though they don't seem to add anything to the plot.
I can't say I enjoyed THE TREE OF LIFE, but I did appreciate it. I did really like the concept of nature versus grace and felt the film did a decent job of getting across the power of grace over nature (aka sin).

Overall, if you like Terrence Malick movies or if you like art films, you will probably like THE TREE OF LIFE. However, if you've never seen a Terrence Malick movie or if you don't like non-linear movies with very little structure, you're probably best skipping THE TREE OF LIFE. It's pretty much for film aficionados only (and many of them don't like THE TREE OF LIFE).",1328572800,,3666,4.391752577319588
4303169,5,B004A8ZX32,"This was a beautiful portrayal of all the phases of life. From birth to death. From love to spite. I loved this movie, and have never been the same person since.",1328400000,3,161,4.225806451612903
4303170,4,B004A8ZX32,"Terrence Malick's TREE OF LIFE is a spectacularly beautiful artistic creation that is, at the same time, frustratingly fragmented and difficult to categorize.  While it attempts to explore the origins of the universe and the meaning of life - huge and often incomprehensible subjects - the story it tells is quite simple.  Jack O'Brien (played by Hunter McCracken as a boy, and Sean Penn as a middle-aged adult) grew up in Waco, Texas during the 1950's.  He remembers his mother (Jessica Chastain) as a deeply caring but passive person who was unable to stand up to his strict and domineering father (Brad Pitt).  When Jack's younger brother dies, the incomprehensible grief of it tears the family apart and leaves Jack feeling lost and frustrated.  The film is really Jack's remembrances of the life he led and his search for meaning in the cold and sterile world he lives in as an adult.

But the film really isn't about this admittedly thin story.  Told in a series of expressionist images and brief vignettes, with whispered narration the viewer will strain to make sense of, TREE OF LIFE is more pure art than any film I have ever seen.  This makes it breathtakingly beautiful, surprisingly powerful, and ultimately a pretentious piece that is polarizing to its audience.  Film is a visual medium, and Malick takes full advantage of that to spin his grand tale of the ultimate meaning of life.  The choice, he says, is between grace (a vague spiritualism represented by Jack's warm and loving mother) and nature (the blind forces of a cold and uncaring world, represented by Jack's emotionally stunted father).  As a child, Jack was tormented by his father's cruel detachment - he admits in one scene that he is just like his father (""I am more like you than I am like her"").  This, Malick postures, is his undoing.  Like his father (whose life has not turned out as he had hoped), anger and disappointment separate Jack from the loving world made possible through grace.  Jack's epiphany at the end of the film brings him full circle, and helps us see that true grace is always there, always calling to us, even if we don't know its name.

I call this film pretentious because it is willing to be pure art.  It's willing to throw itself out there without regard to how it will be received.  This isn't a film that is aimed at a particular audience - it's Malick's film, his visual expression of deep faith.  Some have called the film Christian, and there are certainly references to God and church.  But the spiritualism is really far broader than that.  It's the spiritualism of the universe, and Malick at once acknowledges how small and powerless we humans are and how interconnected we are with things far grander and less comprehensible than our tiny selves.  It's pretentious because Malick pretends to know more than we do.  He dares to suggest that the images he splashes across the screen are sacred and perfect in ways we may not understand.  I don't mean this in a critical way - pure expressions of self can't escape pretension.

Did I like TREE OF LIFE?  I'm not sure.  I certainly responded to it.  It reminded me (as it did many others) of Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, especially in its use of color and music to make a grand statement.  I was also distanced from TREE OF LIFE, in the same way I was from 2001 - both films are so vast in their imagery that the viewer can feel lost, especially without the comfort of a linear story to hold onto.  I never felt particularly connected to Sean Penn's adult Jack, which makes it more difficult to truly relate to his epiphany in the film's final act.  But I did feel very moved by young Jack's frustrating relationship with his father, and several scenes between Jack and his younger brother are poignant and powerful (one especially, where Jack and his brother stand on opposite sides of a window, pressing their fingers and hands together against the glass, is beautifully done).

Overall, I do recommend this film to anyone who truly appreciates ""art for art's sake.""  Don't expect a traditional story, and don't expect your questions to be answered.  But if you enjoy the idea of questions, and if you're willing to let the answers evolve over time, as you think about the film, wonder about it, and re-imagine it, then give it a chance.  Ultimately, what this film will be for you depends on what you bring to it.  This is true for all great art.  It's not easy, but it can be worth it.",1328400000,8,4462,4.646683673469388

It basically shows the beginning and end of the universe and ruminates on the meaning of life as told through the memories of Jack (Sean Penn).  Through flashbacks we see Jack from infancy until early teens (Hunter McCracken) and his relationship with his stern father (Brad Pitt) and his gentle, nurturing mother (Jessica Chastain).  The film is sort of a stream of consciousness narrative that jumps from scene to scene and doesn't follow a tradionial plot.

4303187,4,B004A8ZX32,"The intense craftsmanship of Terrence Malick's beatific 2011 film is what stays in the memory far more than his storytelling skills. It's the unique product of a reclusive filmmaker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-of-Heaven/dp/B003152YXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days of Heaven</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-World/dp/B001JDQXCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New World</a>) who does not feel bound by traditional narrative structure or any proven Hollywood conventions beyond casting star actors like Brad Pitt and Sean Penn in pivotal roles. Malick has clearly invested thought and care into every image of this film, but achieving a tangible level of clarity around characters and plot is not nearly as big a priority to him. If viewers are willing to overcome this hurdle - and this is quite a hurdle for many viewers including myself - then one can appreciate how his meticulous approach can seize upon the deeper emotions he is trying to convey in his time-traveling tale of spiritual replenishment. Malick presents two intertwining plot threads - one revolves around Jack O'Brien, a bereft middle-aged architect who appears to be searching for a deeper meaning to his younger brother's years-ago death, the other is a mid-century flashback to his childhood in Waco, Texas, where he is raised by a nurturing mother and a taskmaster father. The parents represent two seemingly irreconcilable ends of a philosophical spectrum with the mother following the path of grace and the father the way of nature. The tragedy of their son's death deepens the chasm that the grown Jack is still trying to rectify in his life.

Once Malick presents the situation, this is where he stops to contemplate the origin of life and evolution. This extraordinary sequence begins with a pinkish-blue glow floating in space, which transitions into bubbles of primordial ooze, life-forming amoeba, and then jellyfish. This gives way to dinosaurs (with one contemplating the fate of another on a riverbank) and a school of circling hammerhead sharks, all ending with an asteroid impacting the earth. Somehow, Malick gets away with this piece of filmmaking brio and comes back to the more immediate family story because he can bring a level of universality to the emotional turmoil brought forth by the personal tragedy. However, his grand intentions also run roughshod over the characters whose motivations remain elliptical in the scheme of his story. Toward that end, the filmmaker makes liberal use of diminutive jump cuts, three-quarter profile shots of the characters, and fantasy images to carry his story along to the strains of majestic orchestral music (courtesy of Alexandre Desplat) to evoke the presence of a higher being in their lives. He comes back to the greater existence by showing the future of the planet five billion years in the future where the earth becomes a lifeless shell orbiting around a sun that has aged into a feeble white dwarf.

When the story itself returns to the present day, Jack appears to be traversing the Southwest canyon country and magically ends up on a beach where he finds emotional closure. The cross-pollination of reality and fantasy into a cathartic state is something Malick does with greater aplomb than most filmmakers, and it helps that he gets a solid performance from Pitt who accurately captures the prideful sensibilities of a father from that period of history down to his frustrated dreams and his buzzcut. Jessica Chastain (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Help/dp/B006IGZWB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Help</a>), 2011's ""It"" girl among critically lauded actresses, has less to do as the mother since she is given barely a word of dialogue, but she provides a memorably lingering impression of repressed feelings and maternal instincts. Penn is not given that much to do either except look pained during his journey of self-discovery. Special kudos need to be given to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Men/dp/B000QGAU4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Men</a>), who provides a vivid grandeur to all the startling visual elements no matter what eon needs to be captured by the idiosyncratic Malick. The filmmaker's hyper-sensitive attention to cinematic detail will definitely impress cineastes, but it will confound and try the patience of the more undemanding viewer. Granted there is a fair amount of pretension and self-absorption here, but one can't help but be awestruck by the end result.",1327881600,3,4668,5.744219653179191
4303188,5,B004A8ZX32,"Tree of Life is a massively ambitious slice of experimental cinema from filmmaker Terrence Malick that recaptures a family living in 1950's Waco, Texas, on both a molecular and cosmic scale. Attempting to microscope two overlapping paths in life, the way of nature and the way of grace, we're introduced to the father, whose relationship with his three boys alternates between affection and bullying, and their loving mother, seemingly detached from nature.

Terrence defiantly refuses anything resembling a conventional plot line, showering us instead with photographic exposures and voice narratives brimming with transcendental beauty, utilizing the book of Job as a blueprint to undress birth, life, death, meaninglessness, and the mysterious shroud of God's measure from humanity, even taking us on an exploration of big bang origins.

Unfortunately, Tree is misunderstood and under-appreciated. There's people out there telling you not to waste your time on this film, and they're wrong. Look, it's simple, if you think Pirates, Potter, or Transformers IS the cinematic experience, then you'll gag your way through Life. It's like nothing you've ever seen before. You can't simply watch this movie. You've got to surrender to it. You've got to let it flow over you like water.

This is either a masterpiece, the best piece of visual media of our generation to explore issues of Nature vs. Grace (basically selfishness vs. selflessness, though I'd use different terms), fathers vs. sons, life vs. death, and the nature (or the existence) of God...

or the emperor has no clothes.

There's much to see here.  On the surface, the movie is beautifully shot, and its editing challenges your thoughts.  The score is great; the acting is super.  But then again, there are so many things that get in the way.  Supernovae? Dinosaurs? Jellyfish?  Really?  Do we need to see 25 minutes of CG scenes to remember how the universe came into being?  And there's all the whispering.  Many of the characters do it in voice over, effectively praying.  But it's so distracting and difficult to hear, it clouds the message that's supposed to be communicated.

I feel like I should have been moved more, or made to think more.  But maybe, just because I felt compelled to write this review, I have been.  Perhaps a re-viewing, or a shot-by-shot analysis, would lead me toward one camp or another, but for now I'll sit on the fence.

4303231,4,B004A8ZX32,"""The Tree of Life"" is Terrence Malick's comment on two different approaches to living and understanding life, that of natural determinism versus that of acceptance or grace, not just in human life but on a universal scale. It's no wonder the film's reach exceeds its grasp. Jack (Sean Penn) is a successful architect who is reminded of his childhood and the death of his younger brother when he sees a tree being planted near his office. He thinks back to his childhood in post-War Waco, Texas, with his two brothers, his stern, overcritical father (Brad Pitt), and empathetic mother (Jessica Chastain). When Jack reached puberty, he often clashed with his father, who seemed to take out his dissatisfaction with his own life on his boys.

We don't only see Jack's memories, but also what came before him -his parents' relationship, prehistoric earth, where we observe some interesting dinosaur interactions, and the creation of the universe. These seem to include Jack's mother's rumination on the meaning of life after she loses her son, as well. The ideas presented are, in a sense, an omnipresent perspective, channeled through these people. Many images are of water, fire, landscapes, and stellar phenomena. I lost patience with one extended abstract sequence that I felt was not connected to the human story effectively. But the film eventually returns to a loose narrative of Jack's childhood.

""The Tree of Life"" is highly cinematic, which I appreciated. Dialogue is spare. The story is told through shots, not scenes. Images are beautiful and strong. And Brad Pitt gives a wonderful performance. I'm a huge fan of the cinematic, of films that are films, not theatrical productions, of images rather than dialogue, reminiscent of the silent era. So I found a lot to like. On the other hand, the film is unnecessarily long. In some instances, Malick simply overdoes the imagery. His thematic reach exceeds its grasp, sometimes conspicuously so. I would cut a half-hour off of it, but Terrence Malick was never in a hurry to get through a film. It's flawed. If you like Terrence Malick's work, I recommend it.

4303232,2,B004A8ZX32,"I usually like art-house type and indie movies, but I could not get into this.  I was ready to give it a chance because it's gotten nominations for awards like the Golden Globes.

This is what happened.

Lots of shots of trees.  Yes, the trees are symbolic.  I learned this in junior high English.  And they're very majestic.  But I'd rather focus on the human characters and their problems.  Yes, I know the trees represent the characters, or cycle of life, but I'd still rather the people got more screen time.

There is almost no dialogue.  Unfortunately, I'm the type of moviegoer who needs at least some dialogue between characters in order to figure out what's going on, what the characters' motivations are, etc.  There's lots of whispering voice-over, but that's not quite the same thing. At the beginning, it's clear that a family member has died, and the parents are grieving.  This is sad.  I felt bad for the parents.  Then the film suddenly turns into one of those films you'd see when you visit a nature museum.  (Perhaps it would have been better in 3D.) It's beautiful, but it just went on too long.

Brad Pitt is a decent actor, who's gotten nominated for this movie, but the truth is that he doesn't do more than a) look incredibly sad, and b) whisper all his lines.  He's excellent at that, though. The young actors who play the kids do a good job, too. The toddler looks very natural stumbling around the yard, exploring.

Artful, intellectual, moving, reflective, and sadly, probably not for mainstream USA audiences. If you have seen other Malick films you expect something artful and this may be his best yet!!!

I watched this film after it was released on Blu-ray. From the opening suggestion ""For optimal reproduction, the producers of this Blu-ray recommend that you play it loud,"" I knew sound was going to be a significant part of the experience.  And it was!  Both the full sonic use of classical music (perfectly paired) and the hushed voice-overs were enhanced by ""big sound.""  The visual experience was equally stunning (as you expect from Malick). From camera angles and lighting to amazing use of computer generated animations you are transported to a very real (but seldom explored) place inside of you.

From the opening moments you are offered two perspectives of life and the conflicts and resolutions of those two perspectives....""grace"" and ""nature.""  Throughout the film Mom presents ""grace"" and Dad is as ""nature"" would have him.  This dichotomy is presented broader in natural scenes, evolution and human interaction.

Having been a child of the 50's this film resonated with me portraying what was naturally expected of children in the 50s. Dad was the Lord of the house and saw his obligation to make men of his sons (I was one of two boys). And mom brought ""grace""  into the family whenever possible; joyful moments circumventing the father's natural structured oppressive leadership.  This film profoundly captured my memories of childhood in the 50s and presented both the conflicts of youthful adaptation to fatherly expectations, motherly love and the later struggles to make renewed (more balanced) visions for our adult selves.

I also found myself reminded of wondrous youthful first time revelations when I noticed things like running, chasing, sounds, smells, the feel of rushing water, the magic of butterflies, the thrill of climbing a tree, and many other wonder-full  moments of first awareness...this film is an emotional banquet of discovery and re-discovery and for forming.

If you happen to be one who can't relate, fine, but please don't assume others won't be deeply affected as I was by this masterpiece of cinematic expression.

It underscored again to me the importance of recognizing how our apprehension of the cosmos in childhood resulted for too many of us into our buying into lie-based thinking about who we are, what place we play in society, and who God is or isn't.

In adulthood the harvest of our misapprehensions too often causes us to run into seemingly intractable problems in relationships and other areas of life, leading as we attempt to deal with these challenges to our living out Thoreau's, ""There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root."" In other words, we think we are dealing with the problems, but in fact we are not as the root of them often goes back to our having bought into lies about ourselves, others, etc., that thereafter colored our view of reality and hindered our being able to live truly successful, meaningful, altruistic, satisfying lives.

Watch the eldest son's actions carefully, creeping through the empty house, etc. Then listen to the remorse when he expresses wanting to take back actions that have darkened his heart and path and ""be like them,"" with ""them"" being the as-yet untainted living around him. Ever felt that? I have.

Malick is known for visually beautiful but incomprehensible filmmaking and he does not surprise anyone here in 'Tree of Life'. If anything, 'Tree of Life' is his most incomprehensible film to date and a second viewing (almost a requirement for any Malik film) does not do much good. It also does not help that, as usual, Malik offers little explanation. Like all of Malik's other films, the DVD set offers little extras to give the viewers clues
 about the intent of the film.
Segments of a life told in disjointed scenes that bounce through time with mumbled dialogue and an overlaid voiceover tell the story (sort of) of a failed father, a solid but suffering mother, and 3 boys. Sean Penn plays the reflective older son remembering the past; Brad Pitt plays the loving but frustrated father. All of this is wrapped up in a prologue that represents the beginning of the universe and an epilogue that represents heaven.
This is the most emotional film that Malik has ever made yet still the viewer is kept at a emotional distance from the characters  Perhaps this is why the film has been compared to Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'; that and the long forming of the universe sequence early in the film. Any Malik film is worth seeing and 'Tree of Life', not one of his best, is not an exception. However viewing might be best done as many people first saw '2001: A Space Odyssey' back in the 1960's; stoned.",1326931200,4,1511,4.634328358208955

4303263,5,B004A8ZX32,"You can see from the bar graph showing the star ratings of the reviews here that this film elicits strong feelings, both positive and negative.  Although the film's overall rating is 3 stars as of this writing (January 2012), the 3-star rating itself has the smallest number of reviews, with the 5-star and 1-star reviews about equally divided, as are the 4-star and 2-star reviews.  It's not that most people found the film to be average, when in fact very few people did.  They either loved it or hated it.

It's unusual for a film to elicit such a polarized response, but it's not surprising that this film would.  Most people seem to agree that the film is filled with beautiful images (and they are stunning), but many people understandably expect more from a movie than gorgeous cinematography.  It appears to me that there are three main sections to the film:  a fairly long introduction, very visual and with only short sequences involving the characters, minimal dialogue and some brief and somewhat enigmatic voice-overs;  a longer middle section, in which the actors are seen in a series of separate but related episodes arranged in more or less chronological order;  and a conclusion, which returns to the highly visual style of the introduction, with the addition of more scenes including the characters, but again, very little dialogue, just voice-overs.

There is a story, but it's not shown in a tightly connected, linear manner.  The director assumes that viewers will fill in the blanks between the scenes, and he provides enough of a structure that this is not something that requires a great deal of speculation by the viewer.  Still, I think this section is the one that viewers may find most challenging (or annoying, depending on one's frame of mind), and I can see that it's not something that would appeal to everyone.  The first time I watched the film, I stopped after about 15 minutes, because I was tired, I had trouble paying attention, and I really wasn't sure it was going to be worth my time or my effort.  I'm very glad that I didn't give up on it, because the second time I watched it, I couldn't stop watching.

The acting is consistently excellent, and I found myself forgetting that it was Brad Pitt, because his portrayal of a 1950's father was so convincing.  The same was true of the mother and the actors who played the children.  It felt at times as if I were viewing a very beautifully presented documentary with high production values.

The soundtrack is a major part of the film, with passages from Mahler, Brahms, and others, and with such a soundtrack, and so many beautiful visual sequences, it's easy to see why this film had been compared to ""2001.""  This is not a science fiction film, and it does not deal with space travel, but both films share a similar style.

The director took on a major project here, he did not flinch from challenging viewers, and ultimately, I believe that he was successful. It's a film I will definitely watch more than one time.

What if Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" focused on a family in the 1950's. Oh, and what if Kubrick focused on human emotions, our sense of loss and the ambivalent relationship that some of us have with God?

You'd have ""The Tree of Life"".

Terence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"" will polarize viewers much like most of his other films; this long medatative film focuses on fate,faith, our place in the Universe and the struggle to the seemingly random nature of the universe. Malick is the Stanley Kubrick of his generation but focuses on human emotion rather than the detached style of Kubrick. His films compromise often stunning visuals with a narrative told primarily through those visuals and brief dramatic (and fragmented here) vingettes.

Aside from Kubrick's film the one closest to this in terms of tone and structure is ""The Fountain"" directed by Darren Aronofsky. If you enjoyed ""The Fountain"" you might enjoy this film although this is even more fragmented.

If you're looking for a film like, say, ""October Sky"", which tackles some of the same themes in a more conventional narrative, you won't find it here. The often fragmentary structure of the film may make this a challenge for some viewers.

Told in a sometimes sprawling fashion covering from the creation and then jumping billions of years later to 1950's America in the midwest, the film follows O'Brien family (Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, Laramie Eppler, Tye Sheridan)as they struggle with a later tragedy) and, then follows the grown up Jack as he struggles with the events of the past. It's a fascinating window into the past and the loss of innocence of these three boys.

The Blu-ray looks positively stunning for the film and the photography of Jack Fisk is brilliant realized in the high def domain. Having said that, if you watch the DVD, it looks quite nice as well.

Audio sounds brilliant with a great lossless 5.1 mix.

Special features are a bit on the thin side with a short ""making of"" documentary that doesn't go very deep into Malick's intentions in making the film from its cosmic beginnings to it's 50's melodrama. We also get a theatrical trailer but that's it.

I'd suggest renting this to see if it's your sort of movie. There's no doubt that Malick creates visually dazzling films with often daring narratives that fly in the face of conventional storytelling but that also means that he isn't for everyone.

I'm sure I would have been able to better appreciate the soaring cinematography and the heavy hitting (if somewhat heavy handed) score. I don't want to tell anyone they can't like this movie, because I'm sure that it has enough emotional relevance to people that it could resonate somehow, but myself being a person who has already once or twice asked ""why?"" and ""how?"" to the sky, I found the filmaker's effort way too simplistic, rife with cliche, and overall BO-ring.

And as far as the score goes, music may not be my particular specialty, but I've always found that if I notice the music more than half the time, someone overdid it. This film, which I'm tempted to call an art-film, is just way too long. I don't know what person in their right mind thought this film was edited enough. And the balance between the sound/images and the dramatic arc/character development was way off, unless you like your movies light on dialogue, story, and development in general. As an experiment, I jumped around on the film, to see if there was a different tone, or perhaps a growth in the music and visuals over time. Nope. I skipped ahead and backwards 8 times and each time I watched the movie for 3 minutes to see if anything about the mood, tone, plot, or intensity changed, and I didn't see anything that built on what came before it, or that wasn't possible without preceding scenes. I almost wish the filmmakers had made a short of about 10 to 30 minutes, or instead, cut out any attempt at linear storytelling and commited completely to episodic mood scenes. My favorite, and least favorite, word is perfect to describe this movie: sentimental. Or maybe it's moody. Or dense?

4303305,1,B004A8ZX32,"Look, this film should absolutely polarise people and in an era of soon forgotten blockbusters and endless sequels, surely that is not a bad thing. As someone who watches movies that could be classified as indie/arthouse and enjoyed Malick's The Thin Red Line, I went into this film with an open mind, looking for and expecting something different and it certainly delivered on that. It is basically a film about the dysfunctional relationship between a father and his eldest son in the 1950's Mid-West, dealing with the death of a sibling and also tackles all the big issues such as faith, loss, the meaning of life, our place in the universe etc....in a very abstract way and is shown mostly in flashback. There is very little dialogue to speak of (no pun intended), especially in the first hour (which I needed the patience of Job to get through) and throughout the film you are shown a lot of beautifully shot, wistful, mostly imaginary sequences which you are left to ponder. The acting is well done, as they are mainly asked to convey emotion rather than deliver words, with Hunter McCracken who plays the young Jack particularly impressive. There is a rather long sequence on the creation of the Universe/Earth (a tribute to 2001?) complete with dinosaurs(!!!)which is nicely done but after half an hour had me checking my fingernails and I'm sure the literati will argue for hours over a chilled Pinot as to what it all means. Apparently, there is a semi-autobiographical tone to this film which may explain Malick's self-indulgence but that doesn't mean I have to embrace its long-windedness.
For me personally, I prefer much much more of a talk fest than this, so it was never going to work for me and the almost 2.5 hours I had to sit through this film I found a total bore and except for possibly the last third when people actually began to speak, quite excruciating,however I willed myself to watch it all as a matter of honour.
Weirdo David Lynch's Blue Velvet is one of my favourite films of all time but it is like an action blockbuster compared to this dreary and oh-so slow moving flick. You may have heard the expression ""a musicians album"" when dealing with new music releases, which basically means that even though the skill of the people involved is not in question, only people in the industry will get it and I would put this film in that sort of category, where no doubt fellow directors and film students would enjoy this work as it is very artistic and well made but the majority will not. Think of the longest 70's prog/art rock album (Tubular Bells anyone?)put out as an interpretive music video by an accomplished but eccentric director, without a script and you will get the idea.
Mainstream blockbuster lovers should stay well away and those who don't mind something a little left of centre should think very carefully and proceed with caution. This film is ambitious, poetic and challenging but it is also pretentious,over-long and deliberately obscure. If you have endless patience and prefer dreamy images that could be interpreted in many varied ways, nary a scriptwriter in sight and barely audible eerie background whispers then this is the one for you, but definitely not me.",1325548800,166,3216,4.7859712230215825

For me these techniques and themes worked very well against the sharp contrast of a war story, but ... now in the Tree of Life, they feel like a hangover.

Too self indulgent for a mainstream movie.  Would work streamed constantly in an art house with ample beer, or as a strong first attempt by a young unknown director.

And while I can see why some critics love it, personally I disliked the movie as a whole. There are parts of ""Tree of Life"" which make sense and would make for an average movie by itself. The bulk of the movie centered around a couple raising 3 sons in a rural town in the 1950s. Due to the editing and sparse dialog, even this portion is a bit unconventional but at least it is cohesive and interesting at times. Brad Pitt is a great actor and does okay in his role. Sean Penn's role is so limited it feels like he was barely in the movie. Overall, the portion showing the family is a nice little ""slice of life"" feature; however, this is just a part of the whole.

My main problem with the movie arises from Malick's attempt to include all of existence in its scope. The portions dealing with the beginning and end of the universe feel like a completely different movie. The idea of trying to handle all of existence is too ambitious and the movie fails because of it. Scenes composed of swirling light in the middle with whispered phrases (yes, he really does this several times) come across as pretentious. I laughed when I saw the dinosaurs because I wondered just how much of earth's history he was going to try to cover.

4303351,4,B004A8ZX32,"No matter what you think of ""The Tree of Life"", you can't deny the passion Terrence Malick put into this project. It is ambitious, to say the least. You'll encounter a tight-knit family from a small Texas town, nature in all shapes and sizes, dinosaurs, and the creation of the universe. I've never seen a film like it, it is truly unique.

I'll be honest: I was nervous going into it. I'd heard everything about the film: the positives, the negatives, the booing at Cannes and the Palme d'Or it won at the end of the festival. It has divided people like few movies before it. Many have hailed it as a modern masterpiece, others have called it a pretentious piece of drivel. The film is pretentious for sure. But I don't have a problem with that as long as I don't experience the cardinal sin of filmmaking: boredom.

Well, I was never bored during ""The Tree of Life"". It is a beautifully shot film, the best I have seen... perhaps ever. It is that good! The cinematography is breathtaking. The visuals of space, waterfalls, fields of plants... it is a sight to see. I felt like picking up a camera and going outside to snap photos when I was done watching it. The music is well selected and goes along hand-in-hand with the imagery. The acting is just fine, Brad Pitt doing a great job, but it's the kids who do most of the acting, and they're fantastic. There were many shots in the film that gave me a sense of dj vu. Images came into my mind of when I was a kid, playing outside, and it made me smile.

The film's plot... well, there is no plot. The film is about life. Brad Pitt is a frustrated father who struggles to support his family and many times takes it out on his three young boys. The mother is the opposite; she's a loving, affectionate woman who enjoys playing and reading to her sons. The rest of the film asks questions: why are we here? Why does God allow certain things to happen?

The film is told in nonlinear narrative. It works for the most part. However, for my tastes, I would have preferred if it had played in chronological order. I think it would have been nice to see the creation of the universe at the very beginning, see the family in the middle, and end with Sean Penn's character. I feel it didn't need to jump around as it did sometimes. In fact, I found the first fifteen minutes confusing and a little frustrating. Thankfully, once it got into the creation part of the film, I enjoyed it the rest of the way. I'd have to say, the twenty minute scene of the creation of life was perhaps my favorite part of the film. It was just so beautiful to look at. The colors, the sound; it would be worth watching in IMAX just for this sequence alone.

Like I said before, I didn't find the film boring. But I did find it a little long. I'd like to think since there really wasn't a plot, the family section of the film just kind of seemed to drag toward the end. Since they were just living life... at times I wished something would happen. The only part I didn't enjoy too much was the ending. It sort of ends with a dream/fantasy(?). Sean Penn seems wasted here. The material is not too strong and he spends most of the film just looking at his surroundings, confused. And I didn't feel the ending had a resolution. It really just... ends. I would have liked a better closure.

Ultimately, ""The Tree of Life"" is a poem. It will definitely not be everyone's cup of tea. In fact, I'm not sure I could really recommend this film to anyone. You really need to go with an open mind. The film takes its sweet time, and the dialogue is minimum, but the power of imagery and sound is at full force.

This director is such a control freak that he wants to manipulate my home video experience with sensitivity for neither the nearness of the neighbors nor my audio system's potential to inflict physical pain?

Get real, you barmy old dude. It is out of your hands now.

A more sympathetic observer ventured that Malick worries about us missing a single syllable of the airy voice over. In that case, he needed to speak with his sound editor much earlier, not me, and especially needed to rattle the cages of the studio apes who routinely ignore all meter level readings during the transfer to digital video. [Incidentally, the transfer techs' negligence is even more appalling when they mix down a streaming version.]

This inability to let go reveals a justifiable insecurity that his audience might just as soon give the excess grandiosity of rumbling molten lava and similar auditory bombast a miss. That ill-advised level-setting directive tipped me resolutely away from being agnostic about Malick's genius (one gets why some admire him so intensely) into derision for his megalomania. Raging against God is not proof of a profound spirituality, but rather of a narcissistic religiosity, its paradoxical opposite.

Yes, everyone agrees the cinematography is lovely, but that audio control trip tainted even my inclination to indulge the DP when he drifts into fey or overly contrived imagery a tad too often, overreaching the picture's distinct visual tone with notes ringing false and/or falling flat. One loathes such maladroit attempts to manipulate the emotions. In good movies, it's a seamless pleasure to surrender to the flow. When that becomes forced & overwrought, I resist & resent.

A last note: People talk about Malick as a uniquely American giant of the cinema. Clearly these folks have never been exposed to the metaphysical meditations of Andrei Tarkovsky, easily the greatest Russian filmmaker since Eisenstein (or ever), and from whom the entire last sequence of Tree of Life is lifted virtually intact.

I watched the trailer for this film, thinking that it would be a good character study movie.  WRONG!  It was some abstract, modern art, poetry mumble jumble that was absolutely boring and disjointed at best.  I want my money back!  I love movies and I enjoy a really well written story.  There was no story, no plot, or anything.  It was like following someone's thoughts with landscapes and music.  I even hated the way it was filmed.  Honestly, this was the worst piece of crap that I've seen in a very long time and it should not be listed in the film section.  Unless one likes modern art, the only way anyone would rent this is because of the trickery that was used to make us think it's a movie with a story.  A waste of money and a waste of the time that I lost trying to watch it (and I never made it throught the entire film - fast forward showed me it was more abstract crap).",1325462400,13,975,4.160427807486631

I waited for something to develop in the movie so I would care. It didn't.
The long stretches of nature footage with music background were disconnected and boring. Ok, beautiful, but I wanted context and connection.

This movie reminded me of 2001 a space oddyssey, but that was done 40 plus years ago. I was waiting for some kid to throw a bone up in the air, and damned if, shortly after, the kid finds a big bone. Lame!!!

Maybe if I'd persevered through more than half the movie it might have hooked me. But that's too long to make me wait.

Those who hate this film -- and they are virulent in their hatred -- are generally incapable of appreciating something unusual. They demand a simple plot, dialogue, A STORY!  Pay attention and you'll notice a very deep and profound story in this film, one about loss and how even the most carefully chosen beliefs and philosophies fail to prepare people for tragedy.

These scenes where ""nothing happens"" are some of the most astoundingly beautiful frames of film ever captured. So much story is condensed into these moments that you can understand the personality of the characters without the creation of cliched drama.

Proust once wrote that art creates its own audience. In a way, I'm glad that this movie has created so many angry detractors -- it's proof that Malick is up to something big and important. It reminds me of how 2001: A Space Odyssey and Raging Bull were treated by average viewers when they first played in theaters.  Fifteen years from now, The Tree of Life will be the only film of 2011 that anyone remembers.

4303380,5,B004A8ZX32,"Disclaimer: let me tell you from the outset that this film is impossible to fully describe in words.  What I'm going to attempt here is to explain my perception of what its underlying themes are.  It might mean something different to another person than it did to me, so if you're the sort of individual who cannot tolerate ambiguity, then I suggest you pass it and this review up.

Having said that...

Sometimes the best way to understand something is to contemplate its exact opposite, which is the meaning behind this review's title.  Fans of the 90s show ""Seinfeld"" probably remember that it has been summed up as as a show about nothing.  And that's a perfect summation of it.  There was no character development, no exploration of great themes, no overarching story.  It obeyed a rule set down by its creators, that it would have ""no huggin', no learnin'.""  It really was about nothing.

This film, on the other hand, is about everything.  By that I mean that it touches on the dreams, hopes, fears, passions, emotions and thoughts that underlie everything we do and say.

Why do we cheer a football team?  Because we want them to achieve greatness.  Why do we want them to achieve greatness?  So we can feel pride and exhilaration.  Why will their victory make us feel proud and exhilarated? Because by encouraging and supporting them we share a tiny piece of that victory.  Why do we want to share in their victory?  Because such an achievement is a validation of our worth.  Why do we want to have worth?  Because we want to want to be loved, respected, and cherished, and only things of worth are loved, respected and cherished.

Why do we want to be loved, respected and cherished?  Because those things make us feel like part of a greater whole.  Why do we want to feel like we are part of a greater whole?
Because at some deep, fundamental level we ARE part of something greater than our selves, but our individual journeys through life cloud this truth from our minds.  Thus we spend our lives trying to realize this union that we are all a part of but cannot see.

Trace your own actions, desires, thoughts and goals, both good and bad, back to their roots, and you will find that they all end up at this same point. For example, why do criminals rob banks?  Because they want money.  Why do they want money?  So they can buy nice cars, jewelry and the company of beautiful women.  Why do they want nice cars, jewelry and the company of beautiful women?  So they can feel like they have worth...and we're back to where we were earlier: the desire to be part of a greater whole.

We all want to get to that place.  The question is what path we will take to reach our goal: the way of nature or the way of grace.

That is the choice presented to the characters in this film: which path to take.  In the end they find their ways to the thing they seek above all, union with everything.  This film chronicles that journey, and expands outward to show that their story is also the story of the entire universe.  Old souls pass through death and merge into everything.  New souls are born and begin the same journey.  The process goes on and on, forever.

And, in my opinion, that is what this wonderful film is about.",1325203200,6,3228,4.462328767123288

4303385,5,B004A8ZX32,"The Tree of Life, the latest film by Terrence Malick, won the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and has been compared to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Like that film, it has received polarized reviews from critics and like Malick's previous work it pushes the boundaries of cinema and is not immediately accessible. It's a film that requires you to think, to analyze, and to discuss; it's not a film that you can sit back and watch at any time. In telling the story of one family, Malick takes his film all the way back to the creation of the universe with the Big Bang. This is not a film without ideas and ambition. The Tree of Life does not intend to entertain, but rather to evoke. It's an existential work that's pacing and scope resembles 2001 to such an extent Malick could have titled it ""2011: An Earth Odyssey.""

Lacking a linear plot, there is no description of the plot that I can provide without giving you a false idea of what the film is about. What little I can say is that the film illustrates the childhood memories of Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn), including his memories of his strict father (Brad Pitt) and his passive mother (Jessica Chastain, whom I find bears a striking resemblance to the Swedish actress Liv Ullman). Throughout the film, as you'd expect if you've seen any of Malick's previous work, several characters deliver whispered voice-overs that ask questions about God, faith, life, death, loss and time.

While the dialogue poses some important questions about the themes explored, it's probably the most irrelevant part of the film as Malick and his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezski emphasize images over words. Malick is one of the great visual filmmakers and he uses images so beautifully that this film is almost entertaining based on the beauty of the images alone. Whether you love or hate this film you can't deny the beauty of it. Malick's eye, the cinematography, and Jack Fisk's production design make this film a wonder to behold. There are some incredible shots of nature throughout and even shots that simply feature Penn wandering through a vast wasteland are haunting and startling in their impact.

There are many special effects (yes, including dinosaurs) and even these are fascinating and beautiful, which can also be attributed to Alexandre Desplat's beautiful, operatic score. As many of them have stayed with me long after the credits rolled, I can't rave enough about the images that drive this movie. As a dream-life evocation of childhood, this film succeeds on a remarkably existential, and perhaps even esoteric, level. The final thirty minutes are some of the most beautiful and moving images I've seen on film, but I can't say that I think The Tree of Life is a perfect film nor can I ignore how indulgent much of it is.

It's a film built on images and it's been written that Malick will reject shots without an artistic aesthetic, but these shots do grow repetitious at times. The pacing will trouble many and I admit that the film felt much longer than it was, but that's not to say I was bored by it. While some will be drawn in by the beauty of it, others will be alienated by the slow pacing and the overindulgence. Know this; The Tree of Life is less of a film than an experience and it is best seen on the big screen.

While imperfect, The Tree of Life is a rather profound cinematic tapestry that doesn't spoon-feed its themes to you and instead allows you to interpret them how you wish and come to your own conclusions. It does evoke emotion in such a way that I've already found it growing in stature in my mind and wish to see it again as soon as possible. It begs to be seen more than once as it gives you so much to take in and to consider that a single viewing can't possibly do it justice. It's a pretentious film, but that's not necessarily a bad thing; in fact, it's the best film I've seen so far this year and I highly recommend it for the curious viewer.

4303386,1,B004A8ZX32,"Boring, trite, clich, drivel, tedious, mind-numbing, infuriating.  Early in the film there was an excessively long mosaic sequence depicting the big bang to earth's formation.  It drifted into a scene of computer generated dinosaurs in a primeval forest.  I wasn't sure if I was suddenly watching Jurassic Park or if this was simply a bad joke on the audience.  We seriously talked of leaving then, and should have, but thought surely, there must be some point to this thing since there was a big cast and a 4-star rating.  By then, other people in the theater had enough already and were starting to filter out.  So, we stayed and it just got more tedious and ridiculous.  The final scene was absolutely moronic.  We suffered through this horrible film and, in the end, I was angry at how it never went anywhere.  I wasn't alone.  Other people in the theater were saying they wanted their money back or this was the worst piece of ****.  I can't remember ever feeling so ripped off by a movie.  In fact, its two months later as I write this and it still makes me angry! Dreadful, horrible, if not the worst movie ever, it's in the bottom 2 or 3.",1325203200,14,1146,4.509708737864078

To be honest it was in a way just a really bad adult spin off version of Disney's Fantasia. Brad Pitt, Sean Penn and any other actors in the film either stood around, or walked aimlessly with extremely sad pathetic looks on their faces. I'm sure they probably ask themselves ""what the hell was I thinking, that movie sucked"" When the film switched to the scenic views it showed a salamander swimming (Weird, what friggin significance does the salamander have) There were also computer edited scenes of what appeared to be bacteria (Again whats the significance of the Bacteria) During the scenic views there would be a woman's voice randomly saying things such as ""Hear Us Cry"" (that just flat out struck me as Odd) I'm surprised she didn't just say ""I Hate My Life, & Your Gonna Hate this Movie""  This film really was HORRIBLE, I do have to give it a little credit, some of the scenic shots were pretty cool.",1325030400,5,1052,4.479166666666667

4303431,5,B004A8ZX32,"This movie is not for everyone as it is like no other movie I have ever seen. It is very emotional and powerful without using a lot of dialogue or elaborate dramatic sequences. I sort of knew what to expect from previous Terrence Malick films, however I was left speechless and emotional after watching this film. I think people who have children may look at it differently than those who do not. It is about life, however it is also about father (Brad Pitt) and son (Sean Penn) and their relationship and how the son's growth and outcome in life relates to his upbringing.

The film is comprised of beautifully breathtaking shots of nature and life and events. It truly is a documentary of life and even the cinematography and camera angles remind me of a nature documentary. The camera floats around the objects and actors as we view them relating to situations and simply living. There are some dramatic conversations and emotional scenes, however I believe I could type up the script for the entire film on one page, double-spaced. The movie somehow captures all the emotion and feelings in the characters simply by their strong emotions. Brad Pitts wife in the film, Jessica Chastain, perfectly captures the emotional power of the situations her and the family are put into.

The entire film is accompanied by beautiful music, which perfectly blends the visual and audio aspect of the film. This film is beautifully directed and one which I am proud to own. It will have a different affect of each viewer, however The Tree of Life left me speechless and in tears of beauty and remembrance of youth and growing up.

The Tree of Life is by far the clearest most accurate Blu-ray I have ever viewed, and I own over 800 Blu-rays and view all of them on a Sony 55"" 240hz HDTV. Having a strong audio system is also important. I cranked this film up as instructed when I inserted the disc. The speech is low and the music is high and crisp. It is a beautiful film and will stand as one of the most influential, emotional, beautiful films of all time. I highly recommend at least one watch of this film on an HDTV.",1325030400,6,2111,4.564643799472296

4303433,5,B004A8ZX32,"Aside from the rather facile and sentimental ending, Malick's latest film is quite strong and ambitious though it will inevitably draw comparisons to Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Malick must have been aware of this, but pushed ahead with the project anyway, confident that he had something new to say about the evolution of life and human consciousness. I'm not sure informed people will learn anything with Malick's depiction of an evolving cosmos, but the visuals certainly have a profoundly emotional effect that is missing from books that take a scientific approach to these matters (e.g. Sagan, Gould, Dawkins, Dennett, et. al.). Malick also doesn't offer any theories about the connection between a cold and unforgiving and chaotic universe (or perhaps multiverse) and the raw emotional impact of losing a child. Like ""The Book of Job"" from which Malick seems to draw inspiration, beauty, if it is to be found at all in this veil of tears, can only come in the form of art and poetry. The author of Job (wisely) provides no answers for human suffering; he gives us instead his magnificent verse as consolation. So, too, Malick cannot tell us why we suffer and what our anguish ultimately means; he can only give us a very gorgeous film to watch and study and discuss. I think the movie is a very strong one indeed; but Malick does seem to slip into ""Capra Corn"" at the end when we see the dearly departed walking hand in hand on a beach in what is meant to be some sort of quasi-supernatural, ""heavenly"" world. So, who knows, maybe Malick is a more traditional believer than he makes it seem in the earlier, zen-like segments of his movie. Or maybe, like many educated Americans, Malick cannot simply ignore eastern mysticism and so gives us a hybrid of eastern/western spirituality. Overall, an enormously satisfying experience and probably the best film of the year.",1324857600,5,1880,4.859813084112149

4303457,2,B004A8ZX32,"While watching this film last evening I couldn't help but wonder what a group of feminists would think of these parents.  I grew up as a fraternal twin with eight other children who couldn't wait to leave an abusive and weekend drunk of a father who gave our mother nothing but a lifetime of pain.  Enduring Brad Pitt's bullying was more than I could tolerate.  And trying to make him sympathetic as a church organist was unrealistic and contrary to his John Wayne posturing.  His rule with a firm hand relationship concerning his three sons was repetitive and monotonous.  And his wife was reduced to a doormat.  One son was emotionally disturbed by his father's behavior and we saw this son giving us endless and endless sullen looks that said ""Isn't he cruel""?  That is when the repetitive scenes became laughable.  Sean Penn shows up as this grown-up child and wanders in slick contemporay buildings of glass and chrome  ....  we also see Sean looking LOST walking over a very rocky terrain and later, a sandy landscape with a (get this!)door frame that he walks through.  Mr. Pitt loses his job and the family packs up to move on.  The film ends with the thre young sons, their parents and other men, women and children congegating on the beach with the birds flying overhead, the sky is beautiful blue, the heavenly choir is soaring and yes, even Sean Penn is there too.

4303458,5,B004A8ZX32,"Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often and the more intensely the mind of thought is drawn to them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me. ""~ Immanuel Kant

Anything which comes from Terence Malick is beautiful, sublime and profound. If any modern director's name can be mentioned in the same line as Andrei Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman, and Stanley Kubrick - it has to be Malick. I've always admired and deeply respected him and made sure to see all his films which is not that difficult given that he has made only five having appeared to the movie lovers  once in five, ten,  or even in 20 years to present us with yet another masterpiece. Yes, that's true. Terrence Malick has only made five movies since 1973, the year of his stunning debut Badlands but his every film is a treasure. His last film The Tree of Life is his claim to cinematographic immortality. Has he succeeded? The opinions split completely starting with the film's premiere at the Cannes Film Festival (2011). The film was met with both boos and applauds. Then, it received the major Cannes award - the coveted Golden Palm - and once again it was booed and greeted at the time of announcement. These who love the film are struck with its scope, boldness and beauty but these who don't, scornfully dismiss it as the example of self-indulgent ponderous pseudo-art film. Looks like We all watch a different movie even if we sit at the same theater in front of the same screen where the great artist bares his soul and takes us to the incredible journey of self-discovery, finding the place for humanity, universe, and the Supreme Being on the map of existence. There are very few movies ever made that could compare with the latest creation by Terrence Malick, philosopher, humanist, visionary. What I saw was a masterpiece, equal in scope of its vision to (an inevitable comparison, I know, but appropriate) Stanley Kubrick's Space Odyssey: 2001. But while Odyssey stays always remote and cosmically dark and indifferent, Malick's film is filled with humanity and is as interested in the Universe evolution as it is in the short on the global scale and ordinary lives of one ordinary family in Waco, Texas, in the 1950-60s. That makes Tree of Live reminiscent of the other great film of past, Zerkalo (The Mirror)  by  Russian director, Andrei Tarkovsky.

The road to Tree of Life took over 30 years.  While working on Days of Heaven, Malick conceived the idea of the film that would explore the origins of life, and wrote the screenplay, Q (Quisida) but the attempt failed, and it was one of the reasons why Malik left the cinema for 20 years. Finally, the time has come for a long-awaited and very personal writer/director's creation. There are not many filmmakers who create the movies searching for answers to the eternal questions, ""Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?""

There are perhaps just a handful of masters, who like Malik, are capable of capturing their thoughts in truly unforgettable meaningful images.  At the beginning of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" there is a wonderful phrase that seems perfectly relate to Malick's films:  "" The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point.."" Such is the world in Malick's Tree of Life - many things there simply do not have the names yet.

Malick's Vision is deep and poetic. It is compared with Tarkovsky's and Kubrick's; comparison which is more than deserved. The first two films coming to memory while watching Tree of Life, are Space Odyssey: 2001 and The Mirror. I found Tree of Life even more effective  than the Kubrick's film of because, being on the same monumental scale of the themes covered and of the same highest artistic merits, the  Malick's film is  endlessly and painfully human, which makes it much closer to me than eternal indifferent dark silence of the magnificent cosmological epic of Kubrick's cinema space.

I've rarely been touched so profoundly with what was happening on the screen when I not just saw but, rather, lived through  new,  much more ambitious and grandiose (in all senses of the word) than anything he ever attempted and achieved, Malick's creation. I fully understand that this film may and will leave many viewers perplexed, frustrated, and cause a desire dismiss it or to mock it.  These voices addressing  God, and God answered Job,  the seemingly absent plot, action, and dialogue  - all of these  may cause a negative perception  as well as  film's constant moving to and from  different times and  dimensions. And yes, there is  a scene with the dinosaurs, whose appearance caused some shock on the part of viewers. I think that in the scheme of the universe, created by Malik, dinosaurs are just as important as all the other components, including us,  the living.

Malick, known introvert and recluse,  is remarkably candid and open in the Tree of Life,  his most personal film. He reflects on the eternal and ancient as the universe itself matters and does not know the answers to them,  but he has the talent to embody the thoughts and reflections in the visions of superhuman beauty and deep love. He peers into the life of just one family whom he settled in the provincial town of his own childhood in Texas circa 1950s. But the story of this family in which the joy of innocence and discovery of the world,  dark whirlpools of growing up,  never-ending  struggle of  maternal and paternal origin in a child's soul,  conflicts, losses, regrets, finding  one's  way and awareness of the  place in the world, and, finally, an understanding f and forgiveness,  repeat closely  the stories  of millions  families at any place on earth. Maybe that's why  the story in the film became so  personal  to me.

The beauty of the film is pure and sad. I think the viewers should immerse themselves in it, as in ocean water and allow it to wash over  them. Do not think, do not analyze, do not look for meaning in striking scenes of Cosmogony, but let them go through your soul.  I had to stop the movie several times, because watching  The Tree of Life is an overwhelming breathtaking sensual experience . It is filled with light, air, and open to all winds (notice the white light rippling curtain on the window in the  O'Brien house,  to which again and again returns  Emanuel  Lubezki `s camera). It is washed by with water - the source of life, a symbol of purification and dangerous, deceptive element . This film, like the titular tree, is firmly rooted in  Earth,  but directs  the branches and foliage to the sky, as if floating in the air. Maybe that's why the  levitation of redheaded Botticelli's Grace, re- incarnated in the beautiful Jessica Chastain feels so natural.

Why did Lachrymose by Zbigniew Preisner accompany the birth of universe scenes? Why mourn, not Ode to Joy?  Does this mean that the death is already included in birth, and everything will come to an inevitable end - all living things and Time and Space?  Creating by the power of his talent, strikingly beautiful birth of the World scenes, finding for them the shades and nuances of colors that I have met only in one place on Earth - in Death Valley, Malick sees them as scenes of grief but expresses sorrow and wisdom in such perfect confluence of cinematic images and sounds that once entered into your soul, they will remain forever.

I am sure that The Tree of Life is a film for multiple re-watches.  At different stages of a viewer's life, it might reveal parts of its mystery  but never to l the end. It is hard to recommend, but not to recommend it - simply impossible.  Is it perfect? I do not know. But it takes my breath away.",1324598400,23,7757,4.697777777777778
4303459,5,B004A8ZX32,"I was worried I would find the movie overly pretentious and dull, but thankfully that turned out to not be the case. The depiction of the '50s suburban family was intimately rendered, beautiful and sad, while the cosmic scenes were so well-done that I never lost interest. A great film to watch, and even though I'm sure a lot of the symbolism I'm sure went over my head, it was still worthwhile to watch. It's OK for a movie to keep some distance, after all the movie seemed to intend to portray a God-like view.",1324598400,4,513,4.410526315789474

It was one of the most blatant attempts to be an ""artsy"" movie that I have seen... yet being that obvious about it made it not art, but just bad.  As serious as the tone of this movie was, I found myself laughing at moments that I found unbelievably ridiculous.  Just wait for the dinosaurs and you'll know what I mean.  That's right... I said dinosaurs.  I very much do appreciate movies that break the mold of traditional films, but I came out of this movie feeling like I wasted my money and my time.",1324425600,3,767,4.321678321678322

4303464,5,B004A8ZX32,The Best film of the year that almost everybody else hates. Loved it. My other two faves are Midnight in Paris and Rise of Planet of the Apes.,1324339200,4,142,4.107142857142857
4303465,4,B004A8ZX32,"Sometimes expectations make all the difference. If you go to a museum with the expectation of seeing representational art, pretty pictures of landscapes and beautiful people, and instead find abstract combinations of colors and shapes, disappointment ensues. If you hadn't gone in expecting a Rubens, you might have really liked that Jackson Pollack.

All this is to say, do not watch Terrence Malick's ""Tree of Life"" with an expectation of a summer blockbuster. Or even a straightforward narrative. The film is an impressionistic work that doesn't just move in and out of the character of Jack O'Brien from the present to his birth and his childhood in the early `60's in Waco, Texas; we also see the creation of the universe and quite possibly the characters in the afterlife.

The film jumps from domestic scenes of family tension to static shots of great natural beauty to flights of fantasy. So if you just go into a film wanting to see ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy marries girl"" or ""man robs bank, cop chases robber, big shoot out""... Disappointment ensues. In fact, some theaters screening this film in some parts of the country have posted a sign saying, ""This film does not follow a conventional narrative structure"" to cut down on demands for refunds.

These tendencies are not new to Malick. His first films, ""Badlands"" (1973) about a less glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde and ""Days of Heaven"" (1978) about farmers at the beginning of the 20th Century, featured leisurely meditations on natural beauty -- but within a traditional narrative structure.

Writer/director Malick took a couple decades off before returning with ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998) about the Pacific during the Second World War, a film that began Malick's downplaying of narrative. ""A New World"" (2005) about Pocahontas and John Smith had even less narrative drive, and with ""The Tree of Life"", Malick seems to work without traditional cinematic storytelling altogether.

But if one goes in without expectations of a traditional narrative, there are treasures in this film. It beautifully captures what it was like growing up in a certain time and place. Even more, it captures remembering growing up. There are wonderful, natural performances by the children, especially by Hunter McCracken as young Jack. Jessica Chastain is luminous as Jack's mother and Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances as a father giving his all but perhaps not giving where he should.

What I appreciated most about the film was the consideration of Biblical and theological issues. The film opens with verses from the book of Job, ""Where were you when I laid the earth's foundations? ...while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?"" (Chapter 38, verses 4 & 7.) We then see the characters dealing with loss as Job did, but we are given the context of the Big Bang through the dinosaurs. It is important to remember that God knows our grief, but He views it in a much larger context.

We also see Jack choosing between the path of Nature (what Paul refers to as the Natural Man) as represented by his father and Grace as represented through his mother and brother. Jack even paraphrased the Apostle Paul from Romans 7:15 that he does what he does not want to do. We do see Jack's progress to finding salvation through grace.

If you are open to a different movie experience, you may want to see the impressionistic work of Terrence Malick. Or this summer you have lots of opportunities to see superheroes and stuff blow up real good. Just know what to expect.",1324339200,6,3563,4.877685950413223
4303466,5,B004A8ZX32,"There is a scene in this Terrence Malick magnum opus where two brothers about 9 and 11 are running along the banks of a stream or river.  One has a BB gun.  They take turns shooting into the water or at trees.  Finally the older boy dares the other to put his finger in front of the barrel.  This was me many years ago.  There were several scenes in this film that will likely bring back memories, especially for those who remember small towns, unlocked houses and inventing things to do when there was no electronic stimulation.  The film opens when Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) gets a telegram.  As was usually the case in decades past, telegrams often carried bad news.  This is no exception.  She learns that one of her sons has died.  He was 19.  We don't know how or why.  She calls her husband (Brad Pitt) at work to give him the news.  For anyone with children, this hit to the gut is devastating to both the family and the audience and brings us quickly into the film.  The grief of the O'Brien's transcends into memories of a better time.  A time of birth of their three boys.

Malick then tosses in a 16 minute foray into his ideas of the creation of the Universe and evolution.  With the help of legendary filmmaker and photography pioneer Douglas Trumbull and numerous others, Malick creates his own visual extravaganza including early life on planet Earth.  Yes, there are a couple dinosaurs.  But not a T-Rex or some other well known species.  We see one on a beach, just arrived from the sea.  We see one, similar to an ostrich but with teeth, pin down another unfortunate enough to have short legs.  He then just walks away.  Just another day on earth 80 million years ago.  This trip will challenge your Blu ray display and your surround system.  In fact an opening line before the movie begins suggests that you play the film loud and I agree.  Not only for the great sounds and beautiful soundtrack but because, the actors will speak over a scene in a reverent whisper.  The O'Brien's are a God fearing family and do their best to honor Him.

The film set mostly in the 1950's around Waco, Texas but the town isn't clearly identified.  I suspect this was done on purpose.  It could have been a small town in Indiana, California or New York.  A time of large yards, clean water and open spaces.  A time when most of the crime was vandalism at the hand of kids overcoming boredom.  While we are never sure of the circumstances or identity of the son who has died, we know it isn't Jack the oldest.  He is now a successful architect in a big city.  As an adult he is played by Sean Penn.  When he enters the movie he is speaking with his father by phone.  Something is wrong.  Again, Malick keeps us in the dark but we suspect another family member has died.  The film closes the circle of life on a beach.  Perhaps a metaphor for entering Heaven.  Throughout the film Malick focuses on the balance between ""grace"" represented by Mrs. O'Brien and ""nature"" represented by Mr. O'Brien.  Keeping this in mind may be helpful understanding this potentially divisive movie.  ""The Tree of Life"" is like no other film and certainly one of the best of the year.  The Blu ray disc is of reference quality.  The extras are minimal, but include a trailer and an interesting making of documentary.",1324080000,9,3304,4.469798657718121
4303487,4,B004A8ZX32,"If you approach this film as a conventional movie, then you're bound to be disappointed. It's thin on plot, character development, and other storytelling conventions you expect from a 2-hour movie.

But if you approach it without those expectations, as something different or experimental, this film has great beauty and majesty to offer.  I liken the film to a ballet (or opera), where the set design, music, choreography, and succession of signs and gestures (not all of which are meaningful) combine to produce a dazzling effect.  The kind of ballet would be more Swan Lake than Cirque du Soleil.

(Operative idea here: E. D. Hirsch has argued here&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Validity-in-Interpretation/dp/0300016921/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Validity in Interpretation</a>&nbsp;that we cannot rightly judge a work of art until we know its genre and the conventions that go along with it.)

The soundtrack is phenomenal, perhaps one of its most approachable aspects (being drawn from familiar classical composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Gustav Mahler, Gustav Holst, Hector Berlioz, Henryk Grecki, and John Tavener).  More so than in other films, it serves as the foundation, or the context, for the visual images we see.  I wouldn't at all be surprised to learn that the soundtrack was largely chosen before Malick shot any of the scenes.

I think the analogy here holds up because one of the most common comparisons in reviews has been to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000UJ48SG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, which featured orchestral music by such composers as Richard Strauss (Also Sprach Zarathustra), Johann Strauss (The Blue Danube Waltz), Gyrgy Ligeti (various), and Aram Khatchaturian (Gayane Ballet Suite).

The other tangible parallel is the convergence of the scientific (or physical) with the spiritual. In both Malick and Kubrick, we see scenes from evolution, from our prehistoric past. There is no hand of God or suggestion of such. But nearly every present-day scene is imbued with mystery, wonder, and beauty, which all seems pointless if not somehow placed there as a signpost to something beyond itself.

In this Malick is both more explicit and (curiously) more allusive. The film begins with a quotation from the Book of Job. Later, we hear parts of a sermon on Job's sufferings. Characters ask questions in the voice-over such as ""Who are we to you?"" the 'you' here clearly meaning God. So, in part, there's an ongoing conversation with God, one that has been going on for centuries (but conspicuously missing from Kubrick's film). In the end, we are asked to take sides.  As the mother sets out in the first few minutes of the Malick film, will we follow ""the way of nature"" or the ""way of grace""?

I should add that, even with the generous interpretation above, I was somewhat disappointed by the beach scenes at the end, which seemed like the final episode of Lost. And I have no idea why the Sean Penn scenes were included, unless they provided a kind of metallic and geometric counterbalance to the formless void at the beginning and end of the film.",1324080000,2,3315,5.491159135559921

4303489,5,B004A8ZX32,"It seems that almost all of Terrence Malik's films get some critical praise when they come out, but get heavily dumped on by the general public only to be hailed as a cinematic masterpiece years later. This latest foray appears to be no exception to that tradition. I saw it first in a short run, small theatre with a poor sound system which made following the diologue difficult to say the least...but visually, I loved it as much if not more than his prior films.
At the beginning of this Bluray, it is recommended that you turn the volume up loud for best effect...so I did. The second time, at home, with the sound cranked up, this film was 10 times better than the movie theatre experience. I tried to see what others have said negatively about this work (i.e., the lack of plot, storyline, self-absorbtion etc.)...just couldn't find anything remotely similar to those comments. I did find an incredibly beautiful and powerfully moving experience in a very unsentimental, unambiguous way. Tree of Life, to me, doesn't attempt to explain life as much as show how wonderful it is in all of its nuances and the questions it evokes. No one gets kicked in the head and there are no screaming gladiators (but there is a B-B gun scene). You'll find no memorable one liners or shocking blood lust violence here. The greatest works of fine art never reveal everything the first time around and it always gets better with each visit. There is not one second of wasted film and like every other Terrence Malik film, it gets better every time I see it. I'm glad I bought it!",1323993600,6,1567,4.6

4303491,5,B004A8ZX32,"The Tree of Life"" for me was more than just a film, it was an experience.  I shed a tear and I appreciated the film because it was visually beautiful and cinematically deep and resonated strongly within me. What a wonderful, profound and beautiful film! Thank you Terrence Malick!

From creating wonderful films such as ""Badlands"", ""Days of Heaven"", ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""The New World"", Terrence took on experimental elements in his 2011 drama, ""The Tree of Life"".

Loved by film critics and hardcore cineaste and shunned by the average movie-goer, ""The Tree of Life"" is one of those films that you are either going to love or you are going to hate as indicated by many reviews and opinions on the Internet.

VIDEO:

""The Tree of Life"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  The film is absolutely gorgeous!

The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Children of Men"", ""Burn After Reading"") is magnificent.  The various cuts of family, city, architecture, past, present, the afterlife,  life in balance with the CG elements of the film, there are so many cuts of this film and Lubezki and the many editors who took part in this film should be applauded.

I know that this is the biggest contention that many viewers had, to be taken out of the story and having to watch the beginning of life in the universe, our galaxy and of course the comparisons to a film such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  But I do want to emphasize that ""2001' and ""Tree of Life"" are nothing similar.

There is a message within the film, but its subjective of how one identifies with the film and how they interpret those scenes.  Because the CG elements may take people out of the film and lose them, I'm sure those viewers will be disappointed but for those who are able to enjoy those elements, will find how the inclusion of Malick's experimenting makes this film quite profound, visually and emotionally.

Look at the cinematography and these elements of the film as a form of art, a painting or poetry, existential thoughts, nothing more, nothing less.

As for the picture quality, I was amazed by how vibrant this film looks on Blu-ray and in HD.  There are so many shots utilized for this film, many colors. Even during scenes with a lot of reds where you think there is a chance of banding, none whatsoever.  No artifacts, no sign of DNR, black levels were nice and deep, detail incredibly high and everything was crisp.  Videophiles will be pleased with how breathtaking this film looks on Blu!

But for the most part, ""The Tree of Life"" is a visual masterpiece!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Tree of Life"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and English 2.0 Dolby Digital.

When you see right at the beginning of the film that the creators of this film want you to watch this loud, you know you are in for a treat!  The lossless soundtrack for ""The Tree of Life"" is immersive!

From the earlier scenes when Mrs. O'Brien opens the door to receive the telegram and then Mr. O'Brien receiving the phone call of his son's death and hearing that jet's engine and propellers envelop the soundscape, I knew that I was in for a treat.

During the musical moments featuring Alexandre Desplat's music, may it be operatic or orchestral, music envelops the soundspace as all channels are being utilized.  During the narration moments, the dialogue is crisp and clear as audio is carefully selected and dialogue is heard clearly through the center channels.

But once you start watching the birth of life, the creation of the universe and planet, this is where the film shines as you can hear the lava crashing into each other, during the scenes of water and hearing splashes all around you.  When the planet Earth is created, you can hear the wind and the rustling of the tree leaves, when the dinosaurs are shown, you can hear the booms and the ambiance crisp and clear.

And even during the scenes with Jack playing with his brothers and friends and hearing the ambiance of sound all around you was magnificent and if I haven't mentioned it, Alexandre Desplat's music is phenomenal.

Audiophiles, ""The Tree of Life"" utilizes the 7.1 soundtrack magnificently!  This is one heck of an immersive soundtrack that is magnificent!

Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Tree of Life"" is a profound film in which is possibly the first film I would call a masterpiece knowing that so many people either loved or hated it.

Filmmaker Terrence Malick has always known how to reach out and touch people through his films and those viewers also having multiple opinions.  But with the ""Tree of Life"", it's one of those films where film critics loved it, and when the masses went to watch it, immediately sites such as imDB and other blogs were filled with ""I don't get it"", ""a dull rehash of '2001'"" and of course alluding to the rave reviews at festivals to the boos at film festivals.

Even actor Sean Penn wasn't sure what to make of the film as he told the French publication""Le Figaro"", ""I didn't at all find on the screen the emotion of the script, which is the most magnificent one that I've ever read. A clearer and more conventional narrative would have helped the film without, in my opinion, lessening its beauty and its impact. Frankly, I'm still trying to figure out what I'm doing there and what I was supposed to add in that context! What's more, Terry himself never managed to explain it to me clearly."" (note: translated in English courtesy of the New York Times)

But I wonder if the busy Sean Penn is commenting about his actual role on set vs. his role in the film because for me,  it was quite easy to see where his role comes into the film.

In fact, I'm quite intrigued to read the various comments from viewers because I often wonder, ""are we all watching the same film"" because each comment is so different.  Needless to say, it was a film that led to subjective comments and I'm sure Terence Malick is probably having his own laugh of how people are reacting to the film or possibly doesn't care.

He's not the only filmmaker who has created films that went over people's heads.  Fritz Lang's 1927 film ""Metropolis"" didn't receive much fanfare, nor did F.W. Murnau's ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"" and the list goes on of films considered as a masterpiece today but was not appreciated during its time.

But everyone has their own opinion of this film and for me, I absolutely loved ""Tree of Life"" and I have to say it was a film that resonated strongly within me.  It's story, its visual elements and even the voiceovers, the words spoken, I was truly touched by them.

I was born and raised Catholic, similar to the character of Jack, I was raised with a nurturing mother, while my father was in the military and each time he was home, I grew up thinking it was one of the worst times of my life.  As he grew up from a strict upbringing, at the time, I couldn't understand how life was so miserable at times whenever he returned back home.

Miserable in the fact that my mother allowed me to have fun with friends, my father did not.  My mother allowed us to have fun, my father did not.  He was an authoritarian and when we did wrong, we were punished, spanked and I could not understand why my life was like it was when he was around.  Interesting juxtaposition today, where I now have a closer relationship with my father as an adult.

But as a child, burning inside me was these conflicted emotions to stand up to my father and his strict rules and those very emotions that we see with young Jack, I was very like him.  And with Mr. O'Brien, I find a lot of myself in him today, wondering about today's world, raising a children in this world and wanting my child to be prepared for this world.  I inherited my father's strictness, his hot temper but also having a nurturing side as my mother as well.  But I often worry that my son will have those feelings that I did as a child towards me. But I know that in life, parenting and the emotions that a child has eventually changes in time.  It's an evolving cycle of life in which people choose their own path, make their own right and wrong decisions.  It's life!

And as for Mr. O'Brien and Mrs. O'Brien, I often see the parallels of my own family life and growing older, having seen loved ones, friends who have lost their own children.  Even with me and my wife, also having that dark moment of our lives of something that was not meant to be.

This film is about life.  The pain of losing a loved one but knowing life goes on.  It's a long human life of love, pain, suffering...but we move on.  And for the CG elements incorporated into the film which many complained about, my feeling about the experimental use of the CG to show the creation of the world, the planet, the dinosaurs, the asteroid hitting the planet...this planet has seen its fair share of the death of life but also its fair share of the birth of life.

Within our own family, we see life and death happen.  For our own demise or someone else's demise, we know it's coming... may it be natural causes or one's decision to live life recklessly, we know death is always around the corner.  We don't dwell on it but we try to make the best out of our lives, especially for our children.

But sometimes, while life is good, we are thrown a curve ball.  We live, we move on...and for some, they forget.  But we hope as parents, our children learn from life's lessons, our lessons and hope they are prepared to move on, after our own demise.

The conflicts of love, family and life is what embodies this film.  We feel it because we lived it.  Terrence Malick is able to capture it on film but not by traditional means.  Yes, it's a complex film but its a film that asks the question of which path do you take, of grace or nature.  Money or love?  God in your life, or no God in your life?

And as for human life, in the context of this world alone...we know we had Dinosaurs before us, were obliterated during a catastrophic event on Earth but yet, life continued.  New life began, humans lived and possibly, we are causing our own catastrophe on our own planet or something else is bound to happen but still, life continues.  Whatever that life may be.

I have to say that the casting on Terrence Malick films are typically spot-on and ""The Tree of Life"" is no different.  Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain are absolutely wonderful in their role but the children selected for the film was perfect.  And to find out that it took two years to find the children for the film using 15 casting directors and searching all over Texas to get the right children, it goes to show how meticulous Malick is when it comes to the characters.  In fact, even Jessica Chastain had to undergo many auditions and interactions with Malick before she was hired as the mother.

And of course, visually the film is a masterpiece.  There are so many shots that were planned and also unplanned (Malick would shoot the boys playing around at times they were not shooting to capture that natural element).  There is just so many wonderful things that lend to the film's efficacy.  Wonderful acting, its script but it's visual storytelling and its wonderful music is fantastic.

As of this latest review, I have watched this film now five times, because I love it so much!  And while this film has garnered split reviews of those who loved it and disliked it, those who are able to appreciate it for its story, its beauty and its overall message can understand how Malick was once again able to create a masterpiece.  It's a fantastic film!

While ""The Tree of Life"" may not come with a lot of special features, the Blu-ray looks and sounds fantastic and you also get the DVD and Digital Copy version of the film.  I just feel it's one of those must-buy Blu-ray releases, especially for cineaste who are Malick fans!  This is a fantastic film!

From the many shots and how vibrant this film looks via HD to the wonderful lossless and immersive 7.1 lossless soundtrack, especially the awesome music of Alexandre Desplat, just on its picture and audio quality, this film achieves 5-stars.  This is a wonderful Blu-ray release that Malick fans, cineaste especially videophiles and audiophiles can really appreciate!

Overall, ""The Tree of Life"" is as a straightforward or as complex as one wants it to be.  In fact, I'm confident enough to say that ""The Tree of Life"" for me was more than just a film, it was an experience.

And if one is able to accomplish that within a film, I know it's a masterpiece.  Thank you Terrence Malick!

""The Tree of Life"" is highly recommended!",1323993600,6,13237,4.560355781448539
4303492,4,B004A8ZX32,"Terence Malick's ""The Tree of Life""  is about as good as it gets in terms of an American film with avant-garde qualities destined for wide distribution.  And so I can understand why it won the Palme D'Or because it was a wholly American picture that simultaneously transcends that very category by way of its universal appeal.  Generally the cinematography is stunning--This is a great film to look at--Whatever one ends up thinking about the content.  A number of themes are juxtaposed resulting in a picture that wants to have it both ways--IE ""Life is beautiful and mysterious and we're all connected""--Yet concurrently--""You'd better be tough, strong and Machiavellian or you're not going to make it in this world--Nice guys finish last"".  Or: ""There is so much beauty in this world.  Therefore one has no excuse not to make something of themselves.""  In the process the film goes back in time in its exploration of Darwinian themes--IE a scene featuring a wounded, bleeding dinosaur at the edge of the beach while hammerhead sharks hover nearby; elucidating the fact that in nature the weaker creatures are left behind to die; the more fragile among us are more likely not to survive.  Secondly--God is a legitimate force in the lives of this 1950s Texan family that is the focus of this picture.  In one scene--Mrs. O'Brien points to the sky and tells her son ""That's where God lives"".  The world of the dinosaurs is destroyed by a comet--God decides to take back what he has created.  Just as God decides to take back Mrs. O'Brien's son.  By having faith one can justify the irrationality of Nature.  Similarly, Mr. O'Brien's tough-love / borderline abuse of his son Jack is also justified by this film.  Which works in the end because although tormented, the older Jack (Sean Penn) ends up being what appears to be a very successful architect with all the accoutrements of success--Jack is truly his father's son.

Highlights of ""The Tree of Life"" include the state-of-the-art / influenced by ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" visuals--They do lend credence to the way this film explores age-old philosophical and spiritual questions.  Whereas ""2001"" is cold, bleak and sinister--""Tree of Life"" tells the viewer that we're all in this together.  For almost all of the picture I was drawn in by Malick's vision--The coming of age story; the superbly created cosmic visuals accentuating the process of mourning and the resulting contemplation of the universe and the meaning of it all.  But then near the end of the film comes a sequence featuring many people wandering around on the beach.  While I found some of it to be moving--It was also the weakest section of the picture.  Here I could see influences from Fellini's ""8 1/2"" and ""La Dolce Vita""--Groups of people near the ocean in awe of the mystery of life.  But in the end, this sequence made me recall the ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing"" Coca Cola commercials from circa 40 years ago.  In this ""Magical Mystery Beach Scene""--Even the boy with the burned scalp (representing the Misfit / Outcast) who is viewed with suspicion by the neighborhood boys for his ""difference""--Will be loved--If only by his mother.  Because again--""We're all in this together""--And so compassion is possible.  Regardless of its ever-changing hues--This film is ultimately hopeful.

4303493,2,B004A8ZX32,"I saw this film on blu-ray DVD at home, by myself.  After about the first 20 minutes, I began to feel tedium settling in on me, in the form of those long breaths, or audible sighs, that indicate a restless attention span.  By the end of the film, I was no more involved or interested, nor did I particularly care how it was ending.  I didn't hate it; I didn't judge it to be a waste of my time; but I certainly found it to be an empty experience.  If it was meant to raise profound questions on the meaning of life as ""nature"" vs. ""grace"", I failed to respond.  The one single question I had in my mind, scene after scene, was ""What was that supposed to be about?"", or simply just ""...Huh?"".

I realize that there are many who see this film as a work of art, and a moving cinematic experience, and I certainly would not deny their sincerity, or accuse them of pretentiousness.  Indeed, I am happy for those who derived a degree of beauty and insight from this film.  However, I think that if I had invited some friends along to see it at the local cinemas, I would have been very uncomfortable, wondering what in the world they were thinking about what they were being subjected to on the screen.  And now that I have seen it for myself, I certainly could not recommended it to anyone I know, being aware of just how off-putting it can be.

Nevertheless, I am encouraged that there are directors like Terrence Malick, who overcome all obstacles of the economic movie marketplace, and create supremely individual works such as ""The Tree of Life"".  Just because I didn't respond positively does not mean I cannot accept it as a personal work of filmmaking art.  I am just one of those whose imagination it failed to capture.",1323820800,47,1722,4.3974763406940065
4303494,5,B004A8ZX32,"Last night I finally had the chance to watch Terrence Malick's ""Tree of Life"" with Brad Pitt and Sean Penn. It is a 2 hr 20 minute visual poem on the great story of life. It is beautiful, painful and profound with stunning imagery and music. It will appeal to the more creative thinkers as it is designed to make you think and discover connections that impact how we live our lives today. It is unlike any movie you have probably ever seen. I'll be chewing on what I saw for the next couple of weeks and already want to see it again. If you think this sounds interesting, put it on the top of your list. A large screen and surround sound is highly recommended.",1323820800,4,660,4.246031746031746

However, it was worth watching just for the beautiful scenes in it.  I watched it on my Lap Top which has a Blu-ray player and again on our television (sans Blu-ray).  This film has made me start looking for an HD TV and a Blu-Ray dvd player!!  Awesome..and the music was beautiful as well.  To me, the story could have as easily be left off.  Couldn't decide whether to like or hate the father!!",1323734400,3,512,4.111111111111111
4303496,3,B004A8ZX32,"A am a big fan of Malick's and have seen all of his previous films. I have Blu-rays of three of them. But ""Tree of Life"" was hard to sit through. The film was beautiful to look at (as always) but was not emotionally engaging. I got very annoyed at the whispered voice overs. I know this film was a special project for Malick and obviously more meaningful for him than for me. I give him credit for even attempting to give his story a visual equivalent. If I have the patience to watch this again some day, perhaps I will be in a more receptive state of mind. I actually enjoyed the documentary more tha the feature itself.",1323734400,8,622,4.235294117647059
4303547,5,B004A8ZX32,"The love it or hate it reviews of this film (189 as of this writing) are fascinating to read, and it was time well invested reading many of them.  This movie shows the creation story itself, but frames it in the opening scenes where a family suffers the anguish attendant to the death of their son (I presume during the Vietnam War).  This is remarkable.  Mallick actually shows us the connection between God's love, our anguish, and the creation of space and time itself.  And I haven't even scratched the surface of what follows.  Even the 2 minute trailer for this film is quite remarkable; a sort of video poem that contains just about everything that is to come.

So yes, I loved it and I've never seen anything like it, but what about the sheer anger this film unleashed on the part of so many reviewers?  Many of those who loved the film can't make sense of so much raging by those who hated it.  But don't ignore the bad reviews--remember what this movie is ultimately about.  This is the most honest Christian story I have ever seen put to the screen.  Look at the Gospel accounts.  When hasn't an honest telling of God's love unleashed such hate?  This is all a testament to the film's remarkable success.",1323734400,4,1215,4.497716894977169
4303548,5,B004A8ZX32,"Have we become a society that can only think in Black and White, Love and Hate, Win and Lose, Democrat and Republican?  Two opposites without a middle?  The majority of the reviews seem to express either immense love or intense loathing for Tree of Life.  If you read the actual reviews, it seems there are more 2, 3 or 4 star opinions labeled as 1 or 5 stars.  There is a review where one viewer says how much he hates the film, yet he was moved by the depictions in it that recalled strong emotions from his own life.  I believe the best art is able to release emotion, so how is this negated in his 1 star review?  Then there is the 5 star review which says the images are beautiful, but there are parts that aren't compelling for her or that don't hold up as strongly as other parts.  Neither viewer seems to acknowledge their own mixed feelings of the film numerically.  Dare I say we are being socialized to either love something or hate it?  We have to be on one side of the fence or the other.  However, there is no right answer or best opinion.  The beauty of the gray-areas should be embraced.  Where did this come from, and what does it mean for our cultural and artistic future? Just wondering.

I applaud Malick for creating a unique, personal work of art.  I found it hypnotic, in the way that Apocalypse Now and 2001 A Space Odyssey are.  It's nostalgic, romantic, and poetic.  It's not for everyone, and I admit it's not something I will pop in the blu-ray player for a light entertainment.  (The blu-ray transfer is gorgeous by the way.) It requires a commitment to give yourself in to the visceral experience.  The film washes over you and takes you on a journey much like life itself.  You don't know where it's going, what will be recalled, what will change, what we'd forgotten, what we missed, what's next, or even what the point of it all is.  But it doesn't matter.  And yet it all matters.  A grand metaphor. Or not.  All valid.  Thanks for reading.",1323648000,4,1974,4.37465564738292

A different look and feel than Fredrico's Fellini's Amacord and 81/2. At times having  the feel of 2001:A Space Odyssey. The Tree of Life is a wonderful film that is both beautiful and poetic. The visuals are stunning, the Digital copy looks great on a iPad.

""The Tree of Life"" is no different, with its endless mood shots and accompanying musical score. I can't say I disliked it, since I really didn't understand what was going on. I DO know that its basic message is that life is short.

Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain were good, and the little kids were exceptionally good; Sean Penn did what he could with all 5 of his minutes of screen time.

Exquisitely photographed, with a very fine score, I could see watching it again when I had nothing better to do...but there always seems to be something better to do.

So...I watched and watched........until the end (Her Majesty's a very nice Girl). Then I'm scratching my head, my balls, my arm pits.....looking for a meaning.....OMG, I don't actually think with my penis 'cause I scratched my head first. What deep meaning! If only I could have felt so much of a religious experience watching this film! My favorite part was the film's ending. Hurrah! Want some advice? Drop some 1960's acid and listen to Pink Floyd, ""Echoes"" (Meddle Album), and imagine yourself in the Pompeii ruins, and watch a volcano heat lamp light. You'll be glad you did.

4303552,4,B004A8ZX32,"What exactly is one to make of Terrence Malick's wildly creative, deeply personal and ultimately perplexing latest film?  Different reviews of the film have likened it to everything from a poem to a symphony to a prayer.  Each description is fitting, but what is most remarkable about The Tree of Life is that it is at once all of these things and none of them at the same time.  Malick's first film since ""The New World"" is truly an enigma that is not for everyone.  Some will find it deep and philisophical while others will find it unfocused and pretentious.  Yet others will find and immense sense of peace and beauty.  In a way, the film is ultimately a metaphor for life as it will be interpreted and experienced differently by each perso who views it.  That may be its greatest asset.

The majority of the film focuses on Jack, a young boy growing up in the midwest in the mid 50's.  The film follows him and studies his relationships with his brothers and his mother and father (Brad Pitt), who both love him but have different parenting approaches.  His mother instills the virtues of love in him while his father raises him to watch out for his own interests and not trust anyone but himself.  Malick directs theses scenes with little dialouge or exposition, but he manages to suck you in to the story anyway thanks to his masterful command of tone and pacing.  During these lyrical passages of the film, Malick ponders themes as diverse as family, life, death, love, God and the very creation of the universe.

It can all be pretentious and the nonlinear structure of the film will be quite frustrating to those who are accustomed to more conventional storytelling, but there is no denying the majestic beauty of a film that tangles with big ideas in an uncompromising manner.",1323388800,,1787,4.634920634920635
4303553,1,B004A8ZX32,"This has got to be one of the worst movies out there ranking right along, but actually now replacing, The Fountain for first position. This movie is just bizarre.  Within the first half hour there is literally no story, no dialog and no point.  It is just visually someone's idea of... well... who knows what?

*Possible Spoilers may be unintentionally mentioned* The most the movie has shown during this short time-frame is explosions in outer space and visually stunning filmography of different chemical style reactions.  Lots of flashing lights and flashes of different landscapes appear before you on the big screen.  Its all constantly changing. The point of the movie is lost among all of the different sequences.  It appears that the director/writer was on drugs.  Jelly fish sloshing around on the screen? Peaceful music?  You could almost mistake this for a peaceful meditation/sleep inducing movie if it weren't for the opera music laced between it all.  Then a dinosaur appears and runs around until he finds another dinosaur.  This new dinosaur is laying on the ground and the first dinosaur walks over and steps on the head of the dinosaur who is lying down.  What is the meaning of this? Very weird. Ah except it is a precursor to how the father treats his children and a child treats his brother.

Yes, Brad Pitt and Sean Penn are in the movie, Pitt for about twenty minutes combined total, saying roughly ten or twenty sentences.  Penn has an even smaller part with roughly five minutes total and one or two sentences.

This movie was filmed in such a way that it appears as a home video- filmed by a child, at a child's height and extremely close up.  The father is routinely depicted as an abusive, hard-nosed man who places odd demands upon his young children.  Pulling perfectly good green grass out of the yard....By hand....By his child. It appears he has a mental illness of some sort, OCD or maybe just a control freak?  He oddly obsesses over music and freely hands out tidbits of useless information to his kids throughout the movie.  He puts down his children constantly, and the children clearly cannot stand their father.  He is physically abusive to his wife and children.  A child dies.  A woman kisses a child wrapped in a tight white sheet. The whole body from head to toe is wrapped in this white sheet.  The same woman is shown floating around above the grass.  Its eerie.  A second child dies. A child grows up cruel, abusive and acting strangely just like his father. A child tells his father that his father would probably like to kill him when, the reality is, the child would actually like to kill his father. He prays that God will take his father away.  The movie continues as we follow two brothers living life with their family.  The older brother tormenting the younger brother in various different and demented ways.

This is just a really odd movie that only a certain group will like.  This is going to be one of those movies that you either love or hate. I don't see how it could be middle of the road at all. And while ""Dove"" has given it the green light and approved it appropriate for kids 12+, they would be extremely bored and confused.  At over two hours its a bit much.  I am amazed by the people who can see/read deeper into the meaning of these two movies. Or maybe they are just seeing what they want to see?  I kept watching and waiting and waiting for a really awesome ending, and it just never came.  This is like a really bad dream that is in dire need of interpretation!",1323388800,10,3535,4.588516746411483
4303554,5,B004A8ZX32,"I loved this movie. Seems to me a lot of people missed the boat on what this film is really about. Seems pretty clear to me--the film begins with a passage from Job--the guy who thinks he gets a raw deal from God. (The early death of a child is certainly a raw deal.) But, as the Creation sequence says eloquently (and, you do need a big screen and a really good sound system to get the full effect), ""Lord, why?""(us) ""Where were you? (God, I think)--meaning, ""Where were you when I created all this?"" The rain falls on the just and the unjust. Malick's depiction of life in the '50s also rings true to a ""been there, done that"" oldster.",1323216000,4,637,4.2727272727272725
4303555,4,B004A8ZX32,"There is very little dialogue in this impressionistic mosaic of metaphysical/ apocalyptic fragments, which are combined with a disturbing portrayal of family dissension in 1950's. I know that the above description sounds pretty terrible, but it's actually enjoyable if you have the time and patience to sit back and take it all in.  I waited a long time for this film to come out on DVD and I wasn't disappointed. But don't buy or rent it if you're looking for a traditional story with a firm linear plot, a logical sequence and easy-to-understand concepts.  It's more like undergoing an artistic/philospohical experience as opposed to watching and absorbing a storyline. My only complaint is that the little bit of dialogue that exists, is spoken primarily in whispers.

Brad Pitt is excellent - the family melodrama part has potential, it's like the early draft of a good film.  However, the whispered/muttered ""profound"" phrases that pervade the film are ridiculous - they reminded me of the uplifting cliches on those annoying inspirational posters - and the Sean Penn character should have been edited out.  (I love Sean Penn, but his character adds nothing to the film.)  The final scene is like a Monty Python skit - but the humor is (I assume) unintentional.  Overall, this film is way too long and ridiculously pretentious.  I like long, profound, artsy films as much as the next guy, but this film is like a parody of the genre.  I stayed through the whole thing hoping it would get better, but it got worse.",1322956800,3,945,4.656626506024097

I found it annoying to try and watch.

Now that I am older, I appreciate movies about life's experiences ....
films like THE STRAIGHT STORY,  DOOR TO DOOR, etc ...

But somehow this movie seemed to abstract, incohesive and ""artsy""

It felt like well framed scenes pasted together in random fashion but the sum of the parts ended up less than the whole.

Rather than get pulled in and compelled to watch, it was more of an effort to watch to the point it simply was not worth the effort -------- no care or concern for the characters at all.

After a few attempts, I simply could not tolerate more than 30 minutes of it.

The 2 people watching it with me were of the same opinion.

Beautifully filmed scenes, but it just never came together as a compelling story.

The background DRONING monotone music and heavy repetitive pedal points also were annoying",1322870400,3,948,4.427745664739884

I had difficulty with the first viewing, but subsequent viewing made me see how seamless the storyline is.  My initial resistence was probably due to over indentification.  Pitt has never been better, and Chastain was a revelation.",1322611200,5,373,4.951612903225806
4303589,5,B004A8ZX32,"There is something so wonderful in this movie, it's hard to put into words. More than the story line which is a classic and far-reaching scenario that has affected each one of us no matter how old we are at present ~ but this is even much, much more.  What we have is the birth, constant change, and creation cycle along with a quiet, picturesque 1950's flavor literal ballet of life, death, and rebirth.  Captured is the struggle of Masculine/ Feminine values in conflict from the beginning a new family. The man overburdened with the heavy responsibilities and fleeting joy of raising a family and bringing in enough money to sustain it. How quickly his views become jaded with the dog-eat-dog world of 3D. This takes place every day and is a key element in our daily struggle.

The pressures put upon the father in this sustaining role, preclude and bias him, so that he is unable to enjoy and actually relate to those he is sustaining. There is great symbolism between Father, Mother, and Son just as there is in most of our relationships with God, the Father. Our views on God have everything to do with our own relationship with our own Earthly father. And a son who can never please him. Most of us know this struggle up close and personal. On the other hand, the wife and feminine influence, has no real respect or power but sustains the family in a different set of values. Those of beauty, compassion, art, kindness, nurturing yet she lacks power to change her own world or so it would appear due to unreal expectations put upon her.

So in counterpoint against each other is the Father/God (Masculine) and Mother/Earth (Feminine) elements we each share.

Add the loss of a son, grief, and through the dark vortex of grief, anger, and regret is born a whole new vista.  We have the ""creation"" of this new world fueled by anger with the symbolism of the CREATION. Dark void (death) and the bubbling up and restoration of this new world as it moves like our original birth through all the stages from ameoba, tadpole through every stage of development in the womb into human form and into the light of a new day and dawn. This is how humans and Stars are born, as well as Galaxies and Universes. It's all about the whole spectrum of the Tree of Life. The struggles in duality which we have an opportunity to leave now as Earth ascends into a new dimension and out of the old polarities. And these are so well covered in this movie. It's a keeper and I am on Amazon today to purchase it, instead of just viewing it.  It has my highest rating.

There is far too much to absorb in one viewing but it makes me wonder if this movie isn't the reason that Brad Pitt has retired. It says everything possible to be said about our lives and the very Tree of Life itself.  It doesn't get better than this IMHO for a motion picture. The only thing that could be expanded greatly are the reconciliation scenes in the end. Our actually reunions with all the aspects of ourselves, Mother Earth, our Creator and our loved ones is not spectacular enough on this film to match those we will be experiencing in the days ahead but it's a lovely beginning for sure. And that's enough.",1322611200,10,3171,4.481802426343155
4303590,5,B004A8ZX32,"Should one want to know the meaning of Life, one has to deal with ""perspective"" otherwise one is not even able to frame reasonable questions, let alone arrive at any meaningful conclusions.

""The Tree of Life"" takes the ""Job"" approach to perspective (as in ""The Book of Job"").  Our problems (and accomplishments), accurately represented by the movie's characters, approach zero magnitude in importance relative to the enormity and vastness of time and space along with the Grand Design responsible for them.  The movie overwhelms us with the magnificence of the universe, and by doing so attempts to properly remind us of our place in it.  When such an impossible task is undertaken, the best that one can do is to try to portray the unportrayable, and hope that the resulting failure will nevertheless be enough to trigger the awe and wonder desired.  We are cinematically reminded that whatever significance we may have is entirely limited to our infinitesimal part of a virtually infinite whole, and artfully prodded to reconsider what is important.

One can certainly argue that the movie bites off more than it can chew, but to do otherwise would be to abandon the subject altogether, an unacceptable alternative.

It was deeply touching and intimate. I cried through some of the scenes (yes, I'm a grown man) and left the theater in an overwhelming 'awe' unlike any other movie experience of my entire life. This movie, to me personally, is a MASTERPIECE of film making that has set a new standard of poetic genius. Now, with that, I will say, this movie is NOT for a vast audience of people to enjoy. Many people have bad reviews and I can understand why. If I had seen this in my early 20's, I most likely would have walked out or complained how lame it was. Being older in my late 30's with some ""life experiences"" under my belt, I was mesmerized and humbled beyond anything I've ever experienced from a film. I'm also thankful that I had a select few of my more intellectual friends to view this movie with and we talked for hours about the film afterwards. Even days after, we were still discussing various scenes and situations of this movie. To me, that is a wonderful gift from a director. I can't wait to watch this again with the director's commentary.

4303639,5,B004A8ZX32,"This movie absolutely isn't for everyone. I tried to share it with other people and they hated it. It is not really a movie in the traditional sense, or a pretentious attempt at trying to infuse big name actors with an art-house drama, it's something new, something different. I can't explain this movie in words because a simplistic description would not do it justice. This isn't a film for the monkey brain, it's a film for the soul. I was emotionally stirred by this movie because it is a visualization of what I have only known as thoughts and contemplation.

This movie came to me at a time in my life when I have begun a phase of embracing close personal introspection and I really want to get beyond the materialism that I've been enculturated to believe is so important. I want simplicity and happiness, I don't want the big house and the credit cards, I want a simple life in a simple place where I can focus on living my life. This movie is a statement that even though we as individuals feel so important in our self-centered lives and feel worthy of the attention of the universe, there are processes that are far greater than us in the expanse of the universe. The film doesn't superimpose any kind of belief about religion unto the viewer, it remains respectful and open for individual interpretation. This movie doesn't hijack your thoughts and tell you what the story is, in fact, this movie is more synchronous with imagination than any other I have seen. The crescendo of this movie is the God/universe scene which is one of the most spectacular cinematic sequences I have ever witnessed, I wept while watching it.

I don't recommend this movie as a casual rental or something the family will enjoy. It's one of those movies that requires attention and a time when your mind and your life can be quiet for a couple of hours and you want to have an emotional experience rather than be superficially entertained.

My favorite line from the film that resonated the most and seems to underscore the intention of the film was ""there are two ways through life, the way of nature and the way of grace. You have to choose which one to follow."", I choose grace and believe that those who enjoyed this film and will enjoy it are of the same belief.",1321833600,10,2257,4.554187192118227

However, on the merits of the movie itself, I was less impressed.  It seems to me that it was created to be a ""thinking movie"", but it mostly fails in that regard by plodding development, a limited plot, and the aforementioned sequences that interrupt the flow of the movie.

But since it is one of the most talked about movies of 2011, I think you owe it to yourself to watch it, if even just once, to see what everyone is talking about, and to truly feast on the eye and ear (a fantastic soundtrack accompanies this movie) candy presented.

I ignored ""Tree of Life"" when it came out -- because ""New World"" was weak, and I also belatedly realized, having sort of grown up, that ""The Thin Red Line"" is quite dubious too. But one day, truly bored, wanting to see basically anything, I decided to take a look. Well, I've now watched it eight times (including five days in a row), and it's absolutely glorious, my third-favorite movie ever.

It is unbelievably decadent compared to the ultra-disciplined ""Days of Heaven"" -- though more comprehensive, and very nearly better. Again and again Malick seems to knuckle under to his impulses. That doesn't make it much worse, though; it just means that this could never stand beside the hard, demanding masterpieces of the ages that best cultivate the mind, including ""Days of Heaven."" I would compare the matter to Wagner, another artist supreme who did a lot of things he shouldn't do. Like Wagner, Malick is one of those titans of whom there are three or four per century, that you just can't understand how their minds could possibly exist, or even continue to exist once made -- accordingly, his blinding genius almost totally destroys his own shortcomings.",1321315200,8,1307,4.753303964757709

The movie gives a thorough depiction of the difference between living a carnal/naturalistic life and a life lived in the pursuit of grace. If you liked 2001: A Space Odyssey then this movie is right up your ally. If you hated that flick, then refrain yourself.

4303679,5,B004A8ZX32,"I'm no stranger to hating something that everyone, especially critics, informs me that I should love.  Take, for example, my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gran-Torino/dp/B003ASLJO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gran Torino</a>.  I thought it was just awful, but I recently saw it appear on a critic's list of ""best movies ever made.""  So I am sympathetic--to some small degree--with the people who gave ""Tree of Life"" one star and then panned the hell out of it.

You do have to go in knowing what to expect.  This is not traditional story-telling.  Not by a long shot.  It is dream-like, impressionistic, metaphorical, non-linear.  In less skilled hands it would be nothing short of a mess.

But as it stands, this is the most astonishing piece of filmmaking I've ever encountered.  From the performances of the young actors to one-of-a-kind visuals and soundscapes, this is art that can only be film.  The story in ""Drive,"" another great movie, or ""Moneyball,"" ANOTHER great movie--can and were communicated in books.  They could have been done on the radio.  ""Tree of Life"" can only be film.  What it conveys depends on well-chosen images, sounds, performances, and juxtapositions.  It is a masterclass in using the specific virtues of film to convey feelings and provoke thoughts.

That is not to say that I didn't grow impatient with ""Tree"" sometimes, or that I don't think I might have been a little happier understanding more of what the intent of certain things was.  And as a person with no supernatural beliefs, I was annoyed by some of the vague, New Age ""spirituality"" toward the ending (though I appreciated the boldness represented by some of the questions asked of God).

But do I think it was pretentious or self-indulgent?  Not really.  It was a particular vision that touched on big issues using unique methods from a singular perspective.  To a large degree, that describes all great art.  If something like ""Tree"" is criticized, as it is by many of the one-star-givers for being too artsy and dull, the suggestion would seem to be that we give up on art altogether and focus exclusively on entertainment.  I love entertainment.  But I don't think a couple of hours of mild confusion and the need for rapt concentration is too much to give for a rich and provocative experience.

I confess that when I first started reading the one-star reviews, I wanted to dismiss all of them as having been written by Philistines and low-brow dimwits.  That's not fair.  Even among those who fancy themselves artsy, intellectual elites, ""Tree"" might land with a thud.  It's not for everyone.  But if you love cinema--not just a good story told on film, but the medium itself--and you love wrestling with existential and metaphysical questions, and you can appreciate great performances that don't necessarily add up to a traditional, linear narrative...don't be frightened off.

It's fine if you do end up hating it.  I promise I've gotten over myself and won't judge you.  I just think that a lot of the people who might turn away because of the almost even number of glowing and glowering reviews might be missing out on something that might have amazed and enriched them.",1321228800,16,3231,5.049149338374291

4303707,5,B004A8ZX32,"OK, look, let me say right out, as a movie, this will not be everyone's cup of tea. It is dense and strange and long and lacks what most people would recognize as plot, dialogue, story, and so on. So don't go and rent or buy this because of what I'm about to say or because I enjoyed it (at least I think I did...). The most apt comparison is perhaps Kubrick's 2001 - and this is less plot-driven and stranger. Looking at reviews here, it is obviously polarizing. Some will think it is unspeakably profound, others will think it is unbearably obtuse and pretentious. Both are valid opinions, in my view.

But as a Blu-Ray? Holy Toledo. Easily, easily, EASILY the finest Blu-ray I've ever seen. This transfer trumps the superb BD's available for The Thin Red Line, Baraka, Sin City, Hot Fuzz, Pirates of the Caribbean, and any other live-action BD I've seen (I won't evaluate it against animated movies except to say that I'd rather watch this than any of those, because reality trumps animation in terms of visual interest, IMHO).

In terms of detail, every single frame of the film displays absolutely pristine detail. Every blade of grass, pore of skin, stray hair, texture of fabric, pebble on the ground, ripple of paint on a wall - is visible with absolute crystal clarity. The detail on faces is unreal (and believe me, I was transfixed by Jessica Chastain's face whenever it was on screen - she may be the most radiant vision of feminine beauty ever committed to celluloid). Peach fuzz on a baby's face in a mid-focus shot was easily evident.

Color is superbly realistic, black levels are deep and inky but not crushed, and there is absolutely no posterization or banding on a set of very challenging scenes depicting skies, spacescapes, starfields, and so on.

Film grain is visible from up close, but I am assuming the film stock used was a relatively low-grain one (similar to ""The Reader""). There is absolutely no evidence of any undue digital manipulation. It is as if there is a piece of film being projected by a perfect machine, onto a perfect screen surface, with perfect focus on your HD television screen.

Stunning, stunning, stunning. Even if you don't end up liking the movie, it's worth a rental just to witness the Blu-Ray format in its full flower.

Brad Pitt and Sean Penn are cast as Pitt the father and Sean the fast-forward to grownup older son who takes the brunt of Brad Pitt's poor fathering as a child, amidst a CGI / Hubel telescoping the idea of creation and ""G-d."" The questions it lays out are deep, existential, universal and monumental, but its idea of itself as a vehicle to comprehend, handle and execute answers to these serious, everlasting questions about G-d and fate and death-to-innocents is what makes the movie weak. The boy's pubescent obsession with lingerie and his admission that he is now cut off from G-d (cause he masturbated on his neighbor's lingerie(?)) would have been places a deep thinker might stop and explore, not touch on and run from. The last 5 minutes were particularly brutal in their demand we stay around for this - as the writers and producers took that last big dose of amphetamine-like pretension - and added a combo of every silly Hollywood notion of how ""we all meet in the afterlife to walk into the ocean together now that we see how silly we've all been"" ending, and for the last ten minutes of the film, as the music swelled with each long fade, I found myself whimpering aloud, ""please be over, please...""

It's worth seeing to understand where the bar is within Hollywood's understanding of the deeper things in life. It did make great use of cinematic technique, so from a technical point of view it was edgy and creative. To have Sean Penn wandering around at the beginning, with just a hint of what his own loss was... you just know it's bad.... But ultimately it's not sustainable, and I don't think you can blame the audience for not appreciating it.

I was expecting to love Melancholia and hate Tree of Life.

Hate? Isn't that harsh?

I've only seen one other Mallick film, and that was The New World. I have a policy of watching every film that has positive reviews to the end no matter what... After enduring through The New World I started to rethink my policy.

The whole film is one long montage. I felt detached and indifferent to all the characters. Looking at the IMBD forums, I found that it's actually the style of Mallick. So I decided not to give his other films a chance but Tree of Life won the Palme d'Or so I was screwed. I was going to have to watch this film one way or another.

Is it like Mallick's other films? With non-linear stories and montage after montage?

It is exactly that.

When Tree of Life was in wide release, several theaters put up warnings about the film's uncanny structure... Encouraging anyone to have an open mind going into the film and that refunds will not be given after 20 minutes.

I hated The New World, but I was absolutely blown away by Tree of Life.... 6 years is a long time to produce a film and Mallick clearly didn't waste a second. Word on the street is that there's a new director's cut coming out that is 8 hours long.

What's the story of Tree of Life?

Not much of a story here.... the power of the film is how nostalgic it makes you. I have nothing in common with a childhood in Texas 1950 but Mallick managed to paint a beautiful portrait of all the dumb stuff we did as children but not just stuff but our limited view on the world and the process of losing innocence.

Will I like this film?

Depends.

It's been a long time since I've seen such polarizing responses to a film. People either HATE it or LOVE it... That's what happens when you try to rewrite the cinematic language.

Normal films have scenes leading into scenes but Mallick chooses to show us a mosaic of beauty. Stuff just happens. There's a extended sequence in the middle of the film that has nothing to do with the story but does parallel the themes in several ways. It can be really jarring, just let go and relax. Make your judgement at the end of the film because you won't get anything like Tree of Life for a long time.

Like poetry, it doesn't limit itself to the constrains of heavy exposition like novels. Poetry doesn't always make sense and it depends heavily on the individual experiences of the reader. It's the same case here, the film seems like a jumbled mess of scenes from his childhood and even the creation of the cosmos but the fact remains: there's something hauntingly beautiful about it.

Not just gorgeous in the shallow sense of external beauty but beautiful in the living miracle of life... Seeing the childhood of our shy protagonist through Mallick's lens felt magical because this is a man who's constantly fascinated by the smallest nuances of life. The mammoth film tries to cover the entire scope of the human experience and it does a damn good job of it too.

I think that any serious cinephile should experience this film, even if just for the originally of its cinematic language.

Tree of Life is poetry. Simple as that.",1320451200,42,3208,4.4436860068259385
4303715,5,B004A8ZX32,"The issue with Tree of Life is not whether you like it or not....some will find it life-changing, others a bit slow and pretentious. In this sense, to rate the film as a stand alone object is to miss the point - one needs to take into account who we are becoming as a people in order to judge this film as either acceptable or not. I'd like to think that even if people suggest that it's ""not for them"" that they could concede to its visual and metaphysical power (and, if not for them, then for others). Perhaps the better question to ask is if 'Tree of Life' brings something good and fresh to the table with regards to film philosophy...I would say undoubtedly ""yes"". In this regard, I believe it may be one of the top 10 films of the past 25 years.",1320451200,8,752,4.1931034482758625

4303757,5,B004A8ZX32,"This film bears the hallmarks of Malick's work with wide-panning shots of open landscapes, low level scenes set amidst natural life like grass fields, evocative silences and atmospheric tensions between people in their dance of body language.  This film specifically is an emotionally evocative elegy to despair, regret and love lost.  More particularly affecting for me were the panning shots of galaxies, starscapes, holographic light forms and scenes in the natural world, with voice-overs asking the kinds of questions that I had asked of myself and God in the midst of pain and loss. I kept thinking of someone emotionally close to me who died in the last year as I watched it, echoing in my head the same kinds of questions I should have had the presence of mind to ask and pay attention to when I still had a chance, and which remain worth asking even today. There are things the film said better in its silences than in words, and the choice of soundtrack provided a resonant backdrop to all the feelings felt but left unsaid. The film made me sad and resharpened aspects of my grief but at the same time, I am glad there is an artiste among us who has managed to capture and distill an aspect of art-making that reaches for the transcendent and - in my book at least - comes as close to it as the best of them.",1320364800,9,1319,4.53781512605042
4303758,5,B004A8ZX32,"...and like all art, it does not tell you what to think or dictate how you should feel. Art leaves the interpretation for the viewer to discover. Some pieces of art speak clearly to people that it resonates with and yet that same art can seem like a waste of time to others. Personally, for me, this movie is one of the most impactul to come along in a long time. It is beautifully grounded in the questions of Job concerning sufferings, God and beauty. It vividly shows the balance of nature and Grace; what we consider to be the masculine and the feminine sides of God and His creation. It also shows the older son's anger towards his father and how that leads to both rebellion and at the same time, his need for forgiveness, borrowing much from the writings of Paul. I identified, as well, with the mostly joyful, simple human family story.

Having said all of that, this is not a normal movie. It does not follow the normal patterns or rhythms of a typical film. If you sit down to watch this with the expectation that you are about to watch a linear story or to be entertained, you may be very disappointed. You have to think with this one and yet, let yourself go as you would with any observance of art.

4303759,1,B004A8ZX32,"Terrence Malick has given great pieces to American cinema: Badlands, The Thin Red Line, The New World and, most of all his masterpiece, Days of Heaven. Out of his filmography - not very long, though - The Tree of Life is, to my opinion, his weakest. No doubt about it: it's beaufifully done, as far as music and photography is concerned. By the way: where's the Alexandre Desplat's score? Being a great fan of this composer I got the soundtrack before seeing the movie; however, there's little or nothing of that music in the movie!).
TTOL has no solid plot, no conflict, no big drama. Descriptive more than dramatic, it might seem to you that nothing has happened in the 2 hours and 18 minutes you've wasted. It ends with the most archeotipical and cheap of all the morals: to live without love is poinless; a pedestrian conclusion that seems to have been taken from a Barbara Cartland novel. Besides, the movie becomes really affected by being so solemn, so ""elevated"" in ideas, so ""intelectual"" that becomes pretentious and sometimes incomprehensible. We might refer to the interpetations but there's little or nothing to say because character construction does not offer much to shine in the interpretative field (What is Sean Penn doing in such a role?)

4303762,5,B004A8ZX32,"This review is intended for those who are looking at the controversy and wondering whether they will hate the film.

Have you ever listened to a symphony from beginning to end?  Have you ever watched a ballet, contemplated a work of sculpture, memorized a poem or appreciated a painting intellectually and emotionally?  Have you ever enjoyed reading a book?  If you can honestly answer no to all these questions, then The Tree of Life may be a difficult work for you to enjoy.

Watch the trailer.  It's an honest representation of what the film's about and how it tells its story.  The pacing in the movie is much slower, but those are the key elements.  It is highly imagistic.  Many of the episodes are like memories, the memories of the narrator, Jack O'Brien.  The impressions stay with you for many days after viewing, almost as if you were recalling your own memories.

Director Terrence Malick weaves many allusions into this film, both musical and cinematic, but you don't need to grasp them all to enjoy the film.  The one reference that you absolutely should understand is the story of Job from the Bible.  The epigraph at the beginning of the movie quotes from God's reply to Job's lamentation.  The infamous creation sequence that depicts the beginning of the universe, the rise of life on earth, and its evolution, can be understood as a cinematic representation of God's answer to Job.  That's why it's included in the film.

Another key to interpretation also comes from the beginning of the film.  There are two ways in life from which we must choose, we are told, the way of nature and the way of grace.  The film concerns the dramatic conflict between these two forces, nature and grace.  The symbolism is not simplistic.  Both the father, who represents nature, and the mother, who represents grace, are conflicted.

There is also an oedipal conflict which is strongly implied throughout the film but never stated.  All of the dramatic conflict is subtly portrayed, often without the use of words.  After you watch it, you will probably have some questions that have not been explicitly answered by the film.  It is an intellectually demanding film in that regard, but you don't need a degree in philosophy or film studies in order to enjoy it.  If you can put a little thought into it you will be rewarded.",1320019200,49,2326,4.740648379052369

4303764,5,B004A8ZX32,"It's called ""The Tree of Life"" for a reason. Terrence Malick's film is a meditation on existence, an exploration of its meaning in a universe that is inconceivably vast and connected. This meditation takes place on two planes: on the Earthly plane, a nuclear family deals with the normal trials of growing up in a small 1950s Texas town; these human concerns are contrasted with existence on the cosmic plane, where natural forces, both macro- and micro-cosmic, lead to the eventual existence of the Texas family and provide a glimpse of what meaning their lives have in this grand scale, which will continue for billions of years after they are gone. Within this general outline the movie also contains many more perceptions, both obvious and difficult, as well as a beautifully realistic rendering of childhood. The performances and mise en scene created by Malick are astounding. Can anyone truly dismiss such a work of art with one star? This is a movie for people who are curious about life's mysteries.

4303798,5,B004A8ZX32,"Terrence Malick's ""The Tree Of Life"" is an epic poem that evokes the fierce power of memory and experience. It dares to use life itself as a ""plot"" and connect the dots between the evolution of the cosmos and the evolution of ourselves as people. In our postmodern times of timid filmmaking or mass production of consumerist escapism, Malick's film asks big questions, takes risks with narrative and really challenges the viewer. It is a tapestry of powerful images and memorable performances.

The film takes us back to 1950s America, focusing on a family being raised by Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain. We see them go through the cycles of birth, growth, pain, conflict and the joy and anguish of growing up and feeling the world knock louder and louder at the door. Malick uses a tragic event to provoke one of eternal questions: Why? In a brilliant move the narrative cuts to an epic montage of the creation of the cosmos, showing the apocalyptic birth pangs of the Earth and the Solar System, nature flourishes and creatures appear in sea and then land. This remarkable section, in its mixture of images, science and music deserves comparison with Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" In one memorable scene Dinosaurs are used to express ideas about compassion that make you wonder if Malick has been reading Peter Kropotkin's ""Mutual Aid"" for inspiration. With unique focus Malick makes the connection between the vast landscape of creation with the smaller yet equally big and menacing landscape of a Texas family experiencing the cycles of life.

The scenes involving the family in Texas are written and filmed with a unique sense of evoking moods, experiences and people. Here the smallest details are polished to a gloss, there is no traditional movie ""plot"" because life itself is not a scripted affair, possibly only the broadstrokes of being born and learning to walk, and even then. With little dialogue Malick goes back to the roots of ourselves, the experience of being a baby, learning from our parents and their dialectics, feeling innocence being pushed away by the darker realities of the world. Brad Pitt and Chastain give excellent performances. Pitt fully creates a stern man who may seem brutal, but you realize this is the kind of iron discipline mixed with fatherly affection that creates someone like Malick himself (the film is party autobiographical), it is impressive to see how Pitt evokes the inner mechanisms of his character through facial expressions and physical mannerisms. Jessica Chastain here is revealed as an actress of unique grace, evoking a love tempered by life's hurtles. Some complain about the spiritual aspects of the film, but in a film exploring life, why can't it feature one of the eternal topics which mankind has embedded into the deepest core of its societies and cultures: God? And in a film that takes place in the 1950s, it is not out of step to show a family with deep religious roots, it is a basic part of the historic American experience.

Malick and his cinematographer, the Mexican maestro Emmanuel Lubezki (Children Of Men, The New World), produce images of wonderous poetry and hypnotic intensity, using natural light like a paint brush. The use of classical music gives the film a grand tone and a special rhythm. Film students in years to come might look at this film in wonder to study its editing technique, the way it is narrative without traditional narrative tricks.

""The Tree Of Life"" shames many of today's films simply by doing something truly different. It might even throw off balance those who've admired Malick's earlier work such as ""Days Of Heaven"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" which featured his unique, poetic style but never pushed the envelope as far as this movie does. In a time when ""daring"" means ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button,"" Malick shows us that the cinema is full of endless possibilities where a director can try to achieve something special, something more profound.

4303839,5,B004A8ZX32,"This is, by far, one of the best movies ever!  The idea of the conflict between nature and grace (nurture) is so vividly portrayed in this movie.  The concept of the strong taking over the weak is the theme of the movie is evident since the start of our universe- since life began on our planet.  And it is apparent in the lives of three young boys as they are raised by two loving parents who have vastly different parenting styles.  The message is that, as humans, God has given us the choice to be above nature and live our lives in His grace.

Both parents are complex- especially Brad Pitt's character.  I could not help but see aspects of my own father portrayed.  He is a loving father who is doing the best he can, but as with all humans, he makes mistakes along the way.  You can't help but hate him at times, but at others, you still know he loves his wife and three sons.

The love shown by the three brothers was heart breaking and real!  Jack's conflict (as a young boy and as a grown man) is also well done.  The ending of the movie- with the end of life on earth as we know it is scientifically sound- as that is what we think is going to happen as our sun runs out of fuel.  It makes us think about the frailty of our existence and how we are all on a mission in our lives, that life is, indeed, short.

The Eternity chapter is also moving.  I can only hope that eternity will be spent with see and loving all those who were with us on our earthly plane.

This movie is spiritual, philosophical, and truly life changing.  I've shared the movie with many of my friends and colleagues.  This is a movie that many will want to see over and over.  It is timeless.  It is life changing.",1319241600,10,1697,4.1503067484662575
4303840,5,B004A8ZX32,"Certainly deserves, that is, must be seen on the large screen to be appreciated. Tree of Life is some two and a half hour of majestic, sumptuous pictures and images with a minimalist plot that can only be inferred. A movie almost entirely told through pictures. This is my take:

One of if not the most difficult experiences for a parent to endure is when ones child dies before they do.  The death is off-screen and never explained. Why Why Why? If there is a God, why did this happen? If there is divine purpose directing our lives, what can be the purpose to violating the natural order and the child dying first. If God can create and order this vast universe and nature throughout history, why would he take my child, the fifties mother (Jessica Chastain) contemplates these questions. What is the plot here?

We see beautiful glimpses of a very fifties family in Waco Texas. Father, stern, strict but ultimately loving, stay-at-home, dreamy mother plays with her three boys, makes meals and quietly supports the decisions of her husband, played by Brad Pitt.  Brad works in the factory but would have preferred a job playing organ or piano, his talent and interest. Life is tough and you have to be tough to survive, he tried to teach his sons.  Kids experience a world without media, cell phones, x-boxes, TV's (!) where they use their imaginations in play. The experiences of Waco effect the child Jack O'Brien who becomes the adult played by Sean Penn. What is the purpose of life? Why did his younger brother die and him live? Fights with his father, rebellion. From this idyllic fifties setting, Jack O'Brien grows to be an architect designing huge soulless glass and steel monstrosities. Fights with his father go on in his head. This movie offers a lot of questions and no answers.

Much of this is seems autobiographical of director Terrence Malick.

We see stunningly beautiful pictures of life, underwater, of earth from space, Pictures not seen since in movies ""2001, a Space Odyssey"". Pictures from the Hubble telescope. Perhaps heaven. A extremely visual movie. A movie of pictures from the perspective of God. The end of days when ""the sea shall give up it's dead"".

Director Malick throws in a soundtrack with a lot of classical music, Bach etc. But repeatedly plays Francois Couperin's ""Les Baricades Misterieuses"" -the mysterious barricades - to underline his point...

I think people with children and people who who have religion in their lives (or think about ideas of religion) will marvel at this movie. Others will wonder what the fuss is about.",1319155200,16,2574,4.81859410430839
4303841,5,B004A8ZX32,"Intertwined in this film is a series of scenes of how the Earth began, how life began on this planet.  I can't help but wonder how someone in the 1950's would have reacted seeing the creation of life on the screen, the active movements of the universe.  The producer seems to believe in God and believes that it began with purpose by a creator. The characters in the movie are godly and attend church.  The family in the film is dealing with the loss of a son.  And, what most people wonder is, why did God punish me or punish a good family?  I think what I got most out of this film, is that God does not punish, we are free to choose a wise path or the wrong path.  And sometimes we choose the right path, that we think is our destiny, but things don't work out as we'd hoped.  Such as the father not accomplishing his goals). And so it seems it is the same parallel when we lose someone too.  We deal with the pain of loss/death and learn to appreciate and love who and what we have.  We come to a realization that life is limited and love is what makes life worth living.  I don't know about you, but didn't all those scenes of the universe, ocean, creatures just make you appreciate the value of life?  I think that is ultimately what the producer was going for.",1319155200,12,1267,4.172839506172839
4303842,3,B004A8ZX32,"Let me talk about what is good about this film first.

All of the actors in this film do really well, even in some of the more uncomfortable scenes. I am a big fan of Brad Pitt and Sean Penn, both are excellent actors and in particular, Brad Pitt's abilities are on display in this film.

The cinematography is excellent and ethereal at times, real craftsmanship here.

I like that the film has a post-Christian slant to it, that it displays a sense that much of what life is about, and what makes life possible is outside of the realm of Religion. But the film really dances around the subject. Its a tease that won't offend.

Now, for the problems, I was really disappointed. The film is too long and too slow moving. Also, I have a problem with films that try to ""say something"" like this movie does. Life isn't fair, Life isn't a Disneyland visit, so what? Things could be worse. The film centers around the experiences of a young Boy, the eldest of 4 boys. So he's spoiled as the only child at first, then by about 3 years of age another brother arrives. This ""loss"" seems to cause him grief and ends up being an excuse for all sorts of weird thoughts and actions. The boy never seems to realize that raising a family isn't easy, that being a father to 4 boys isn't easy, being married isn't easy.

The problem with films that try to ""say something"" always seem to tell one side of the story, such is the case with this story, the whole thing was kind of whiney, the kid grows up in a middle-class family at the peak of Americas wealth and privilege but because he's got too much time on his hands he's doing things that cause him ""guilt"" and confusion. Obviously the original story was written by a member of that pathetic Generation that we call the ""Boomers."" The Boomers who cannot shuffle off without inflicting as much angst and sorrow as they think that they're entitled to.

Unless you are a pathetic attention-starved Boomer I recommend you skip this one, unless you just love beautiful Cinematography and Peak Art-House production methods.",1319155200,4,2054,4.508064516129032
4303843,4,B004A8ZX32,"This is not your run of the mill film with a linear story, but instead is a brilliantly impressionistic piece that mingles a disjointed plot with images - of nebulae, aquatic creatures, even of dinosaurs, and paint blobs akin to 2001's descent into infinite.  All the while vivid music adds to the mood.  It is hard to piece the story together and hard to concentrate on the film, though if one does there is a genuine lyrical beauty to it.

The story is about a troubled family from the early 1960s.  While there is much love in the family, there is also an authoritarian father (in a rare good performance by Brad Pitt), needy kids, and soulful mother, who is in crisis because her religion has failed to protect her from the death of a child.  The moods are very strong, offering clues to the disjointed storytelling, forcing the viewer to fill in the dots.

In the end, it is a matter of personal taste.  I liked the film very much, though my attention wandered a bit.",1319155200,4,972,4.4576271186440675
4303844,5,B004A8ZX32,"I have seen the movie twice and I still have some questions. I have read most of the reviews available and so far, none of them interpreted the movie as I did and for that reason along, I need to share my own impressions. I like the realistic overtones of the family dynamics. It is a movie without flamboyancy or ""make you feel good"" movie that Hollywood is plagued with. The protrait of the family was so real that you can relate to the characters in more ways you can relate in any other movie about family. The imageries of creation were sublime and miraculous, which brought me to the realization that that portion of the movie makes you ponder about creation versus evolution and about a God that watches over all of us...or not. I have always seen first of all, a Creation that evolved. I have witnessed men of science; incredibly intelligent men who argue incessantly about Creation versus Evolution, when to me it is simple to see that the original Creation simply evolved. That takes me to a place when you ponder if there is a God and if He watches us all after His creation. You hear the human voices begging and questioning. And then the imageries come again, evolving on their own. So, what is this movie really about? Although I have enjoyed it tremendously, touching and moving me in extraordinary ways, I still yearn for the answers about the meaning of life. This movie trascends religion. It is about the mystery of life, which stills boggles the minds of many.",1319155200,6,1480,4.567669172932331

It's certainly not a traditional narrative.  It is visual music that resonates with those deepest questions within each of us and taps our primal emotional wells of love, compassion, sorrow, awe, anger, and fear.

The story arch progresses and digresses unlike any other big-budget movie I have ever seen (including Malick's other films) and can easily frustrate the viewer, evidenced by the stories of people walking out of theaters and by the mass of 1-star reviews.  But if you are able to limit, or even eliminate, your references to the traditional motion picture's story arc, narrative, and scope then the movie will be much more powerful and mean a lot more. The film represents Malick's philosophy about reality and life (which has been the backbone through most all his films, but in Tree of Life most blatantly) and about how a man dealt with his own human conditioning (graceful Mother and Darwinian Father) amid this big picture.

This film starts to break the barrier of language and spectacle and starts to communicate to the viewer at a deeper level, somewhat like poetry.  I understand this sounds extremely pretentious, but if taken seriously and just experienced with an open mind, the film entertains and informs us at a level beyond the limits of the medium.",1318896000,52,1338,4.88546255506608

4303883,5,B004A8ZX32,"A tip for all of the people who hated this movie or were mystified by it: instead of watching movies based on stars, look at who directed the film. Look up the name and find out what else they directed. If you have never heard of any of the movies, or if you hated the others, maybe stay away. I mean, if you're just going to end up hating Tree of Life - certainly the best film of the year and one of the most moving and profound I've ever seen - to the point where you feel the need to write a snotty Amazon review glorifying your own lack of sophistication, just don't watch it. Why torture yourself?

Terence Malick is an unusual figure in American film. He's only made five feature films since 1973, all of them gorgeous masterpieces of varying degrees (my personal favorite is Days of Heaven from 1978), but guess what? He's an artist, not some Hollywood hack, and he does not give an F what you thought of his movie, and he's just going to keep on making movies until he dies whether you like it or not. But he's been pretty consistent; if you're not into Badlands, Days, Thin Red Line and The New World, you're not going to like Tree of Life.

The curious, the adventurous, uninitiated will see Tree and be deeply moved and blown away, and perhaps be inspired to look back at Malick's other films. Or, frankly, Tree might leave them cold and that's okay, too.  But the dull-witted, the bores, the consumer mobs, those who only want to watch movies if there are action figures and Happy Meals to buy, those without patience, those without wonder, or empathy or wondering, wandering minds and souls, well, hell.

It was tolerable after that but definitely not what I had expected from the synopsis that I read. If you're not into artsy films, don't watch this one.

If I recall correctly, TTOL was originally slated for a 2009 release, then it was to be a 2010 release, and ultimately it became a 2011 release. I've been a fan of Malick ever since I saw The Thin Red Line more than a decade ago. Upon viewing, I've fallen in love with his films immediately, with the exception of The New World, which kind of went over my head the first time I saw it, but which I also came to love upon a second viewing years later. I didn't get to see TTOL on the big screen (it didn't play anywhere near me), and it's been a long wait to finally be able to slip the disc in and experience this film. There are so many images and words that stick in my mind even after a single viewing: the pain a husband and wife feel after learning of the death of a son; one brother crying on another's shoulder; a woman stopping to give water to a prisoner; one brother telling another ""I trust you"", only to have that trust betrayed; a mother looking back one last time as she is driven away from the home she has raised her children in; a boy asking of his God ""Why should I be good if You're not?"". This is a movie that I feel I must watch again. Some may be put off by the sometimes disjointed (and even strange) imagery, but as others have pointed out, it's important to keep in mind that for much of the film you are seeing a man's memories of his boyhood, and memories don't always present themselves in a clear, linear fashion, and aren't always entirely logical. This film is filled with moments of quiet grandeur, but if you're the type of person who needs something to ""be happening"" at all times and are too impatient to just sit back and take in a beautiful shot of a field of sunflowers, then this movie may not be for you. I know those who have been critical of this movie must be tired of the same old ""you must be too dumb to get it"" comments, but at the same time I hope they realize how weary those who love the film are of the refrain of ""you're just pretending you get it because you like being pretentious"". In my humble opinion this is a work of great beauty, and while I understand that no film is ever going to be everyone's cup of tea, I still can't understand some of the vitriol heaped upon it. Very recently, while reading comments to a video on a video-sharing website, I came upon a nasty comment someone had posted taking glee in someone being injured in the video, and another poster responded with a question that stuck with me.

It's a non-narrative artsy collection of memory slices that critique the masculinized childhood of one man growing up in a 1950s patriarchal family with serious Oedipal issues. This terminally pathetic goo gets sandwiched in some breathtaking cosmic woo a la all great wide angle panoramic experimental cinema that seeks to capture the mystery and wonder of all things. The reviews on Amazon were divided between 1-star and 5-star (brilliant or terrible), & now I can see why.

I didn't mind the cosmic woo but was depressed by the patriarchal e[...] And my own spiritual awakenings have been more cinematic. Or to quote my sweetie: 'That's two hours we'll never get back.'",1318809600,8,736,5.125

For the people who get discouraged after watching 25 minutes of it, or even finish the film but feel it was over ambitious and confusing, you're dealing Malick not Scorsese. Terrence Malik presents films that are meant to be watched over and over again because they need to be digested and reflected on. There are layers of metaphors and symbolism in what I believe to be his greatest achievement. It wasn't meant to be watched like 'Ordinary People' or 'Casablanca', dramas that are explained fully on the surface, but like '2001: A Space Odyssey'.

Now, I'm faced with big decisions - whether to start a family, and all the concerns that come with it.  This movie raises issues I'd rather not think about.  I almost wish I hadn't seen it.  If you're looking for escapist Hollywood fare, the film might seem boring.  It plays like a movie where nothing happens.  The first third of the film, the director puts you into the head of a mother who has lost a child.  Yeah, it's pretty heavy.  And most of the rest of the film is of the kids growing up.  The film is a meditation, more heavy on emotion than story.  And it's more of a spiritual/religious film than a traditional drama.  There is little dialogue in the movie.  The imagery is compelling, though.  Some of the imagery is surreal and dreamlike - and yeah, dinosaurs make an appearance in the film.  But it's not Jurassic Park.  I wrote down a quote from the film:  ""The only way to be happy is to love.  Unless you love, your life will flash by.""  I wouldn't have given a second thought to that if I were a 20-year-old.  But I'm older now, and this suddenly means something to me.  It's definitely not an upbeat feel-good movie.

If you go to the product page of any other Terrence Malick film, and you'll see the same pattern growing here: people love it or they hate it. It's either five stars or it's one.

Or take two minutes and look at the trailer. If that doesn't pull you in, chances are you won't like the film. I showed it to some friends, and they immediately pointed out that it looked too ""artsy"" and decided not to watch it.

And to those saying they are amazed Brad Pitt would be in this: the man has done many, many films...probably as many artistic ones as summer blockbusters. Check out Babel, or The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. And keep in mind he wasn't tricked or dragged into this either: he a producer on Tree of Life, and I can't say the same about Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

I guess in addition to reviewing the reviews, I should actually mention my opinion about the film.

I loved it. The music, the cinematography, the actors...the whole experience. The only thing I had an issue with was Sean Penn, who apparently had a lot of his scenes left on the cutting room floor, and he himself admits that he's not sure what he's doing in the theatrical release version.

4303924,4,B004A8ZX32,"Discovering the meaning of life (if any) is not a task for the faint of heart.  Terrence Malick's films have all dealt in some way with the mystery of existence, the wonder, beauty and awe of nature and the cosmos against the pain of our mortality so rife with suffering, doubt and disappointment.  Malick's long-gestating mystical, maddening, obtuse, brilliant and inspired masterpiece offers no easy answers but is a living tapestry that provides a head-space for a challenging meditation that taps into the big questions of grace, God, evolution and death.

On first viewing, I was enthralled and since then have had intense discussions with movie buffs and theologians who loved, hated or were puzzled by this movie that transcends description and definition yet for me remains an emotional and spiritual experience.  The story is simple: A 1950's rural Texas family comes to terms with itself against the ferocious mystery of Creation itself.  Note: The enigmatic writer-director Malick grew up in rural Texas in the same time period as his film.  He studied philosophy at Harvard and was awarded a PhD from Oxford.

This is how the story goes: The impressionistic story of a Midwestern family in the 1950's following the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, through the innocence of childhood to his disillusioned adult years as he tries to reconcile a complicated relationship with his father. Jack finds himself a lost soul in the modern world, seeking answers to the origins and meaning of life while questioning the existence of faith. Through Terrence Malick''s signature imagery, we see how both brute nature and spiritual grace shape not only our lives as individuals and families, but all life.

The cast led by Brad Pitt (as Mr. O'Brien, who also produced the film), Brad Pitt (as Jack) & Jessica Chastain (as Mrs. O'Brien) is brilliant. The directing, story & screenplay by Terrence Malick is brilliant.

The music by Alexandre Desplat is brilliant. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is brilliant. The film editing by Hank Corwin, Jay Rabinowitz, Daniel Rezende, Billy Weber & Mark Yoshikawa is brilliant. The casting by Francine Maisler & Vicky Boone is brilliant.

Please Hollywood stick to what you do best, which is making mostly shallow but often entertaining films, and not trying to give your cheap and overly obvious perspective on the meaning of life. Just laughable. Great tales on the meaning of life are told subtly in the context of a story about living life. This may have been possible if the director had done more to develop and tell the story of this family. The problem though is that a good portion of the film is wasted on pointless images of space and nature, which has nothing to do with the story that only just begins to develop in the second part of the film. Also, this is an example of a hole in Amazon's rating system. The distribution is bimodal meaning you will most likely either hate it or love it, so taking average doesn't accurately describe the rating distribution for this film.  If you are a person who appreciates a good story that gives you some subtle insights on the meaning of life then you will most likely be disappointed by this film.

On the number one rating side was a simplistic contrived conflict (i.e. false argument) of purposeful design vs. natural evolutionary change (the bacteria to jellyfish to sea life to amphibian to reptile sequence). For some reason the film anthropomorphizes nature as greedy, selfish and self pleasing and lording over everything, as opposed to the alternative where if you love grace (i.e. purposeful design) there is no ""bad end"", there is no suffering because we all end up in a beautiful place eventually.

Alternatively is the metaphorical interpretation of the domineering authoritarian religious father and heir apparent destructive elder son who hunts/kills and grows to become an architect who coincidentally destroys the beauty of nature with glass/concrete artificiality, are seen in conflict/tension with the mother/wife who playfully communes with cows, trees, water and everything else natural.

Conclusion: If I want to see nature I'll watch the original documentaries from the people who worked hard to film them and not expropriated scenes and if I want a thoughtful discussion of biological principles and spiritual thought I consult those sources directly.  And, if I've misinterpreted then blame the writer/director for unnecessary obscurity.",1318636800,18,1486,5.620535714285714

But like Malick's movies because they make me ""think and feel at the same time"" ... kind of like what happens when I read Flannery O'Connor, T.S. Eliot, or Anne Lamott.

""Tree of Life"" works for me as a film (and I predict it will become a classic), not simply because it hands me a new pair of glasses with which to look at faith, and death, and life through ... but because through sight, sound, and intentional pacing, it introduces me to the heart and soul of a family that it didn't take long for me to relate to or believe could be real, and in a narrative, ""point-of-view"" way it lets me glimpse their journey of becoming human while experiencing not only the pain and loss of original sin, but the healing and gain of original blessing.

I saw this movie at a local art house, and I recognized the polarizing effect it has on audiences as soon as I heard someone proclaim ""One and a half stars"" during the credits.  They clearly didn't get it...but neither did I, entirely, although I was mesmerized by the incredible images and, as a child born in the '50s, felt a kinship with its characters.  I'm a big fan of Terrence Malick's other films, particularly ""The New World"" and ""Days of Heaven"", so I knew there would be similar elements in this film, such as the quiet voice-overs expressing the inner monologues of the characters and the gorgeous cinematography.  I was completely unprepared to see DINOSAURS in a Terrence Malick film...and I was admittedly delighted!  This film is more concept than story, although there is a plot; but it unfolds like ""Howard's End"", slowly and without telegraphing its next moves.  When the ending arrives, one is left wondering what just happened. For me, it had a profound impact.  I applaud anyone who thinks they understand this film after the first viewing, because I knew it would require repeated viewings for me to glean its full meaning.  This film is not pretentious in the sense of trying to be something it's not, but it is pretentious in the sense that it demands more than some viewers are prepared to pay. It is enormously enigmatic, and that's what sets it apart from formulaic films that don't require much intellectual thought (mindless entertainment, in other words).  Finally this is a film I can sink my brain into and chew for a while to appreciate its flavor.  It does not reveal its secrets quickly and to everyone, so you may find you don't like it.

4304008,5,B004A8ZX32,"THE TREE OF LIFE is not the usual film - a story that begins, develops, and ends. Yes there is a story here: in a small town (Smithville, Texas) lives a family - a stern, painfully frustrated artist/man who can't seem to succeed in anything for long except raising three boys with his rather quiet passive wife.  One of the boys dies and the remaining family enters into a realm of questioning life, both at the time of the death of the child and years later through the experiences of the oldest boy reflecting on the meaning of life, his response to his father, his sense of continuing loss.  The setting is in the 1950s - that structureless decade following the horrors of WW II, the unleashing of the atomic bomb, the difficulties of making a living and sacrificing dreams for a reality in a way that changes the way individuals interact not only with outsiders but also with the family unit whose only seeming hope of meaning is relying on religious protocol. Yet even religion seems to fail when the inexplicable tragedy of an innocent child's death changes everything. The journey of the film is the maturing of the eldest son as he grows into a man forever challenged by the meaningless of the loss of his brother and the effect that has on his own maturation.

The power of the film is in the visual and auditory miracles that unfold on the screen.  Writer/director Terrence Malick (Days of Heaven, The New World, The Thin Red Line, etc) has gathered images from nature  - incredible rock formations, waterfalls, volcanic eruptions, floating jellyfish, night skies, and light in all its forms, among many others - and allows these images to seep into our minds accompanied by the music of John Tavener, Gustav Mahler, Aresnije Jovanovic, Zbigniew Preiser, Hector Berlioz, Gustav Holst, Bedrich Smetana, Ottorino Respighi, Johannes Brahms, Francois Couperin, Johan Sebastian Bach, Henryk Grecki, Robert Schumann, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - each work so carefully chosen that the visuals are liberated from the screen to enter our minds.  It is that rare opportunity to watch creation, death, life, and the majesty of nature - none of which is understandable - and that is where the comfort source of this film touches us.

The cast is committed and allows the story to enter our heads untainted; Brad Pitt is the father, Jessica Chastain is the mother, young Jack is Hunter McCracken who ages into Sean Penn, Fiona Shaw is the grandmother, and the other boys are played by Laramie Eppler and Tye Sheridan.  But the real star of this glowing work of art is Terrence Malick.  This film is a masterpiece of cinematic art.  It needs to be seen and experienced.

4304009,2,B004A8ZX32,"Let me start by saying that I enjoy art movies.  I don't mind symbolism.  I don't mind having to read into things a little bit.

That being said, this movie wasn't the worst thing I have ever seen by any means.  It felt like the movie was created by the director / writer for himself for his own enjoyment.  The story in itself is a good story.  You really begin to feel for the characters and for people like myself, begin to relate to the things Jack and his brothers go through.  The mother's love and the father's forceful nature come across very strong and Jack's ""whispers to the Creator"" throughout the movie add a great element of the way most kids question the things around them and why they do what they do.

All in all, this movie could have been cut to around an hour and a half long.  We get to look into the creation of the universe and evolution and dinosaurs.  Not necessary by any means.  Cool to watch but COMPLETELY out of context.  The ending was confusing as well, and maybe I'm just slow, but after two hours and fifteen minutes, I still wasn't sure which brother had passed away.  Imagine if David Lynch (Eraserhead, Lost Highway) decided to make a film about creation.  This is that film.

Again, I enjoyed the core story, but the rest I could have done without, and the fact that the director makes us sit through a Discovery Channel documentary for the first 30 minutes of the movie is reason enough to pass this one up. It struck a cord with me because of my upbringing and childhood but my flaws were the only thing that saved this movie for me.

4304012,5,B004A8ZX32,"So rarely is film let out of its cage. So scarcely is the language of movies used as though it's never been spoken before.

Terrence Malick's fifth film is a grand victory of human awareness and stands among the greatest, most fearlessly original and most universal of all films. It explores human experience from the inside, from within its characters' thoughts and sensations. Malick identifies its protagonist as its viewer and assembles a multitude of brief impressions of astounding vividness to act as an analogue of our own collection of memories. Roger Ebert wrote of Charlie Kaufman's great 'Synecdoche New York',

'For thousands of years, fiction made no room for characters who changed. Men felt the need for an explanation of their baffling existence, created gods, and projected onto them the solutions for their enigmas. These gods of course had to be immutable, for they stood above the foibles of men. Zeus was Zeus and Apollo was Apollo and that was that. We envisioned them on mountaintops, where they were little given to introspection. We took the situation as given, did our best, created arts that were always abstractions in the sense that they existed outside ourselves. Harold Bloom believes Shakespeare introduced the human personality into fiction. When Richard III looked in the mirror and asked himself what role he should play, and Hamlet asked the fundamental question To be, or not to be, the first shoe was dropped, and ""Synecdoche"" and many other works have dropped the second shoe.'

'The Tree of Life' is an other of the greatest of these works. As the years pass, our films seem to be moving deeper and deeper inward. This film attempts to be a mirror. It shows us a life such as our own and asks us to discern what is important in a life, what is good, what is lasting; and what is meaningless noise, what does not last. Kaufman's film also explored the human experience in an unconventional way, but while it had very little compassion and was devoid of wonder, Malick's film possesses those qualities and others in rich abundance.

One the main objects of this film is to evoke the early experiences and impressions of a human life, spanning about a decade. And one of its most masterful sections is the one dealing with the first three years or so. The many brief images and events we see delineate a landscape of early memories; we're delighted by the colorful bubbles we blow. A child with a grotesque Halloween mask. Our mother dances with us and we love her. That chair just moved by itself, didn't it? A scary dog barks at us and we stay behind our mother. A new baby, what does it do? We dream of the strange triangular room in the attic we went up in once or twice. Night after night our mother kisses us and turns out the lamp and this is the way our life passes. A glow seems to surround all things. I don't doubt nearly all of us could construct a similar sequence from our own memories (Dressing me in the morning, my father says, 'Up-a-sky!', throwing his arms upward. I raise mine in response, beaming back at him with delight - his and mine - as my night-shirt is swished off me).

As we grow older and more aware, as the script says, 'Gradually, the subtle radiance passes from things, as though a layer of cloud had come up over the sun. Slowly as the dawn, the boy is growing up.' We begin to see bad things, sad things. Why does that man walk funny? Will our mother have to look as old as grandma does some day? Later, these things seem to be present in many places, or most. What did that man do to go to jail? Could it happen to us? Then we even find it in ourselves; we disobey our mother even though we love her, and we don't know why! We can't resist playing mean tricks on our little brother, dangerous dares. What did we do? Why aren't things the way they used to be? 'How do I get back?'

Malick had his current style of film-making basically set since his third film, 'The Thin Red Line', but there its greatness was constrained by particularities of the project: its protagonist's wonderings did not feel genuine, its original score was unsatisfactory (my advice to film-makers: Most, to nearly all of the time, use preexisting music, or don't use any), multiple tiny roles filled by distractingly famous actors, and other problems. In his next film, the excellent 'The New World', most of those problems were absent, although, like 'Thin Red Line', it still took place within a historical event it was constrained to tell and to serve. But here Malick has broken free of all that, has no one's story to tell but his own, and applies his poetic technique with complete freedom to the life of this common suburban family (and many other things). One of the most important parts of making books or movies is knowing your subject and its details cold. Setting 'Tree of Life' in the same environment and time Malick himself grew up in, he holds all the cards here too for the first time. He soars where before he could only leap.

I love, love, love the way Malick makes movies. He spurns artificial light, films his actors constantly (even when they don't know it), foreswears story-boards, always seeks to captivate fleeting, chance moments; a butterfly alighting on Mrs. O'Brien's hand, thunder flashing in the skies before Pocahontas, an inquisitive baby giving John Smith a kiss. He films and edits what ever and how ever he wants; what ever feels right, what ever is beautiful. He loves open fields, tall grass. He loves twilight and dusk. He loves water. He loves Sol, loves its light shining among plants, among people. He loves flocks of birds, hands holding hands, heads turned upward. He loves things that glow. He nearly always shoots manually; his camera is free. It swings and flutters about Smith and Pocahontas as they embrace. It runs joyously through a forest, peering upward and making Sol beam and dance among the branches and leaves. I am so very grateful there exists such a film-maker as him.

Now, the degree to which there are 'good' actors and 'bad' actors is much exaggerated; actors are basically as good as the script is and the director allows or coaxes them to be. But there are actors who simply ARE the characters they play; who fit them like a glove. Brad Pitt has worked perfectly well in many roles; I should note he does not fit the over-bearing, mood-shifting Mr. O'Brien seamlessly. We're aware every moment that we're watching Brad Pitt playing this character. In a way, the softness his acting produces between himself and his often harsh character may be in keeping with the film's gentle feel. I don't know. I learn that Heath Ledger was originally intended to play the part. I think he would have been just about the perfect fit; not as bright-eyed a man as Pitt, excellent at conveying a certain muddle-mindedness. Look at his character in 'Brokeback Mountain', in which he had children too. Think of how he might have raised sons if he had been more of a family man and you pretty much have the character right there, accent and insufficient love for his wife and all. But so it goes.

Mr. O'Brien is a remnant of a past age in which men lived by their toughness, by their ability to control, to discipline, to command. He raises his sons the way his instincts dictate him to, the way his line has succeeded. But our genes can linger far longer than the conditions which bred them, and a boy need no longer be taught in such detail how best to fight back if he is hit. 'If he blinks, crack 'im!' This generates hype and a sense of moral importance on an event which will not likely ever come (and certainly their father's attempted training sessions only disturbs the boys). In the script, driving by a team of disheveled men digging a ditch in a poor part of the town, their father advises them: 'See those people. Somebody got the upper hand with them. Don't let it happen to you. You've got to get ahead of the other guy. He'll be doing all he can to do the same to you.' And later, 'If you're good, people take advantage of you. Think of yourself as someone caught behind enemy lines. Work! Fight! I see you wasting your time -- staring out the window -- playing! I make sacrifices for you. You honor those sacrifices by what you do. That's how a family works.' His mind is every where at once, among other, worse problems. Malick describes him early in the script: 'His boys regard him warily. His sharp, sarcastic words, and orders so irrational he hardly expects that they will be obeyed. He never asks what they did at school. He does not know the names of their friends. Were he to inquire, they would suspect it was a trap.' 'He has the unshakable belief that he must approve or modify everything the children do. He is full of petty and exasperating cautions.'

Oh dear. Sean Penn. Poor Sean Penn. He costarred in an other of the greatest films I've seen, Tim Robbins' 'Dead Man Walking', and was so perfect as Harvey Milk in Gus Van Sant's 'Milk', that I have, at times, passed pictures of the real Harvey and temporarily failed to mentally differentiate between the two men. Penn called Malick's script the most magnificent one he'd ever read (he can say that again), but was disappointed and a bit confused by the filmed result, and that his own small role ended up being essentially one of a figure rather than a character (and alas for Penn, since his first film, 'Badlands', of nearly four decades before, Malick has not made actor's films). It's true that the script was clearer about several things, especially Penn's character's existence in the city: 'The others do not meet his eyes. Each makes his way alone, shut up within himself. None can be sure of the other. No tie is fixed or lasting.' 'The supreme misery:... to find oneself abandoned to the busy dance of things which pass away.' My guess is it's one of the best things ever written, and much less a movie script than a poetic story, stunningly beautiful, unbelievably vivid in its descriptions of places and experiences. But many of its ideas would be impossible to communicate in film, and ultimately the best medium for the script, as it was in that form, was the written word. I would console him by saying the film has a power very few have ever achieved, and an effect no other has.

The stellar accretion sequence is simply the most powerful and awesome passage of film ever made. There doesn't seem to be any beginning or end of existence, nor a smallest scale of matter, or largest. Multitudes live among the immensity of a single leg of a mite, the keys I type these words on are uneven plateaus gigamiles across. A galaxy is a twisting amoebic mote, stars are searing subatomic particles and my neighbor's welcome mat is more vast than all the wastes of Mars. I set a glass of milk on a table, and there it will stay with all the worlds it contains for a million aeons before I pick it up again, and an ocean wave is no more or less a passing shape than the Eagle Nebula. In our search through the inward planes, we now find within the realm of orbiting spheres to exist a landscape of webbed and dancing strings. This will never end. And all the matter we have perceived is a little explosion whose trifling cause we can not see, whose flying sparks will in an instant fade and turn to lifeless smoke, perhaps to be dispersed by a wind or to sink into an earth, forgotten or unseen. It does not end, it only continues. We live in infinity and eternity. But the film shows us with humbling beauty what little we know of outward realms, and of the history of the continual rearrangement of matter, and gives context of the O'Brien family's existence; the cauldron that will become their world, the microbes they will descend from.

Some silly people inform us that Malick's acceptance of current models of the formation of the galactic realm, of Earth and its biology, conflicts with his at least semibiblical spirituality (he opens the film with scripture and refers to it a number of times, among other examples, and he is as interested in the birth of a soul as of a world), because it contradicts all that the creationists say. Malick, I'm sure, could scarcely care less about the current fancies of that endless debate. He knows that scientists do not spend their years making up malicious lies, and he also obviously feels a silent goodness in the universe. Says Jack the script: 'You whom we met in the woods and on the hills, whom first in her eyes we knew -- how shall I name you?' In 'The New World', Pocahontas speaks to it in the same fashion: 'Dear Mother, you fill the land with your beauty. You reach to the end of the world. How shall I seek you?' Around me I hear religious people confiding to each other that their god feels more present to them when they walk through woods, when they see and do beautiful things, than when reading their holy book. My mother tells me she felt this goodness touch her one night as she sat quietly holding one of her newly born children.

Those who search eventually find the word 'god' to be an ancient verb meaning 'to call out to'. This is exactly what Malick's characters do, although they never once use the word in direct address of the presence they speak to. Kneeling at the foot of his bed, young Jack goes through his prayers as he's been taught to, but we hear his true thoughts running underneath. 'I wanna see what you see.' Malick's main characters tend to have, deep down, the advantage of a rare freedom from established theology; a freedom to directly question their gods, not only request of or thank them (I must confess I lacked this freedom at his age and didn't look beyond my considered prayers). 'You let a boy die. You let any thing happen. Why should I be good if you're not?'

I suppose any established theistic religion tends to forget the idea of such questions, as they seem to go for ever unanswered, and focus on established assumptions. Malick, though, does a thing that few people have had the courage to do in perhaps a very, very long time by renewing those questions, insisting on them; by once more crying out to the powers that may or may not be. 'What are we to you? Answer me.' And perhaps, at times, answers are not wholely absent. Near the end of 'The New World', chasing her little son through a garden in England, feeling peace at last, Pocahontas seems to find one. 'Mother. Now I know where you live.'

Terrence Malick is the great poet of the cinema, and 'The Tree of Life' may remain his greatest poem. It is, among so many other things, the ultimate family movie. It radiates a holiness of family, draws us closer to those we love most. The over-arching tale of 'The Tree of Life' is simple: A man is lost amid a perplexing life lacking purpose and joy. The tale opens in brokenness as he and his mother and father mourn the loss of his younger brother, the kindest and gentlest of the three sons. Seeking a way from his meaningless toil, a way back to the Eden he once knew, he lays his hand on a tree and witnesses the past and future of himself and of all existence pass before him. Jack - and we, the viewers - begin a search for meaning, for that which is lasting, holy.

I am stunned to learn that Malick himself lost his own younger brother as a young man, for which he largely blames himself, and has borne that guilt and grief for the rest of his life. This explains so much about his films - this one above all - and the depth, meaning and power of it are made so much more profound by this knowledge. 'The Tree of Life' is the product of a tortured man, and what we see in it is not only his philosophical message, but is from his own wounded heart. His own pain is present. We are told artists must suffer for their art, and here Terrence Malick, in his anguish for his little brother he's carried since the late sixties, has made a film which stands among the greatest and most essential of all human art. Jack's vision of the after-life is also more clear in this light; what Malick shows us is not only his belief, but is deeply personally important to him. It is his consolation, his hope.

Above all, the film is wondrous. It instills us with its wonder, its awe of all things, and helps us to better appreciate beauty and goodness when it passes before us; to hold on to it, how ever small or brief. There's a moment in the film that moves me more than film has ever before moved me. One morning, when the boys wake to find their father has gone on a trip, and they're free to romp in the house and tease their mother with a lizard and for once life is as it ought be with them, they run outside laughing with her as 'Les Baricades Misterieuses' plays, and we hear the mother's prayer for her children - for all that live.

4304014,5,B004A8ZX32,"So yet again another film comes along that has the audacity to creep into my mind and tousle it around for two hours. I was lucky enough to be one of the (sadly) few around to have seen Terrence Malick's latest, The Tree of Life, this past Saturday in a little dump of a theater in an even bigger dump of of a shopping mall. Talk about your proverbial diamond in the rough.

The film has a lot in common with the book of Job from the Bible (which coincidentally is my favorite). Right off the bat it starts off with a quotation, ""Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation...while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"" A small first part of the film deals with the results of the death of a son in the O'Brian family which leads to Mrs. O'Brian posing the question to God as to why this happened to them. This of course is what serves to next show us the ""Birth of the Universe"" sequence referenced in the opening quotation. A stunningly breath taking 22 minutes where we see galaxies and planets form without the use of computer generated imagery. I have to applaud Terrence Malick for hiring Douglas Trumbull to do this the old fashioned way (minus the dinosaurs of course). I can recall about a month ago having a ""conversation"" with a friend of a friend about recreating something using CGI rather than any other of the old fashioned camera tricks. CGI can be good if you have the money but The Tree of Life again confirms for me that doing things the old fashioned way can yield results that have an authenticity to them that CGI simply can't compete with. I even read a random review where the person said the effects looked and felt more real and solid the way they were done. The music was incredible too and had an epic, cosmic feel to it that gave me goosebumps. The brief dinosaur scene was important to the film too despite some people I had heard laughing at it. In a forest, a young dinosaur cautiously walks around for predators. Later on a riverbank, the dinosaur lies sick. A predator emerges and examines the wounded dinosaur. Preparing for the kill the predator then reconsiders as he watches it struggle against him. The predator wanders off. The point of this is to show that even in nature there is grace, something similar to that which Mrs. O'Brian had stated earlier in the film.

  Anyway moving on the core of the film centers on the eldest of the three O'Brian brothers, Jack, as he grows up into adolescence and learns the life lessons and experiences that will mold him later in life. I think this is where Malick is at his best. His style while filming these scenes was to capture a moment, an accident. The results have such a realistic feel to them its hard to believe anybody was actually acting at all. Brad Pitt gives I think his best new performance as the borderline abusive father with overwhelming love for his wife and kids. He occasionally takes out his anger and frustration on them over his current life situation and I guess you could say that's his main character flaw. He represents the nature way of life while his wife, Mrs. O'Brian, played appropriately with angelic grace by Jessica Chastain, represents well, what else, grace. She as a mother is more carefree and forgiving than Mr. O'Brian. Hunter McCracken as young Jack does a fantastic job showing a further and further conflicted young man as he grows older and feels the natural twitches of rebellion that come with adolescence. Sean Penn lastly does well as the older Jack who has lost his faith and is adrift in the modern world. His internal state is wonderfully reflected in the architecture of the city where he works (Dallas, TX). When Jack is young his surroundings are a very simple neighborhood whereas when he is older he is in a large, complex city that one could easily get lost in without a sense of direction. Its amazing how personal some of these scenes were. Little instances like learning how to walk, feeling jealousy at a baby brother being the new center of attention, playing in the street on a summer afternoon, dinner at the table, church on Sundays etc. Simple things we don't notice too much that contain elements that change us into who we are when we are older. All of these are wonderfully recreated and have a human feeling to them that was lacking in Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film most compare this one to for obvious reasons.

  I'm sure the none narrative structure of this film threw off most who saw it but you can't read this film like you would a book. To do that will simply frustrate you. I found myself sometimes trying to read it as a narrative only to tell myself to shut up and knock it off. The film is more like visual poetry. Its something you have to surrender to and experience. Doing so actually made me recall something I had read from a letter my Cinema teacher at VCU where I go to college had said many years ago about this sort of thing.

  ""The metaphor most frequently used to interpret a film is that of a text. (We can thank both the  semiotic/linguistic theorists, the genre folks and the pop critics for that.) All start off with a notion that to understand/""read"" a film, it must first somehow be ""text""... It must be a linguistic code...rational...logical etc. Their job is a task of interpretation, a hermeneutic function based on personal taste which then becomes an act of criticism. But what if the film under discussion was constructed as ""event""? What if the filmmakers reject a single authorized reading/interpretation of a film as the ""truth"" What if the film is not about the intentions of a single author? What if the filmmaker's understanding of how film operates in a social context is informed by a different metaphor than that of text and hence the interpretation of the intentions of an auteur are not relevant? I use ""event"" as a model for the organization of meaning within the filmic experience. That does not render the film itself as meaningless... but rather, the film itself is designed to allow different paths of interpretation within the event. This allows an audience member to experience and understand/choose from a set of possible interpretations their own meanings. The viewer not the critic or the director becomes central in the creation of meaning within the event. No longer are my narrative ""intentions"" as director the locus for the ""true"" interpretation of the event. As such the film-event can then work under another rule... another metaphor other than ""text"" one that better contours the thing in itself which is cinema.""

  I certainly think films like The Tree of Life pertain to the above and I can understand why people hate Hollywood for not backing more of these types of films. After The Tree of Life won the Palme d'Or this past May I was very sure and hopeful it would be expanded into many theaters nationwide but sadly it wasn't and I had to seize the opportunity to travel a ways to catch a showing and even then like I said before in a small dump of a theater I never heard of or been to before. Quite the travesty if you loved the film as much as I did.

Some closing thoughts.

  I find myself quite annoyed at people who find the film pretentious, As I've said before in the past pretentious is such a knee jerk term these days. It's almost a reflex for somebody to say when something strides for greatness or is just plain different. Ambitious is not pretentious.

  I believe the strange light (taken from Thomas Wilfred's ""Opus 161""  that appears at the beginning and the end and in some intervals in the film is supposed to represent God, the Alpha and Omega. Several shots also show the sun in the sky. At one point Mrs. O'Brian even points there and tells Jack ""Thats where God lives.""There is even a brief shot of some reflected light on Jacks bedroom wall when he is a baby.

  The ""Afterlife"" sequence at the end is I don't think really the afterlife or a form of Heaven at all. My own personal interpretation is that its Old Jack bringing together all the memories of all the people in or were in his life together reconciling with them. Putting his demons to rest so to speak. That this is juxtaposed with the death of the universe signals the end of something. In this case most likely Jacks inner turmoil. I feel this way about this because after the sequence is over we cut back to Jack riding down the elevator and walking outside where he stops and gives a little bit of a smile, as if he feels reasonably better.

  I certainly feel this is easily the best film of the year and that Terrance Malick is a genius but I don't think it will be given the the recognition it deserves come awards season time. Its too artsy for the Hollywood people although of course I could be wrong and pleasantly surprised in a few months or so.",1318204800,10,8828,4.5317410433689505
4304015,1,B004A8ZX32,"This movie was the most painful theatre experience I have ever had.  I knew since first seeing the trailer that this movie was incredibly pretentious and vapid but decided to accompany my friend who is an intense Malick fan.  Had incredibly low expectations but even those did not prepare me for the 139 minutes of hell I had to endure.  I gave up trying to understand the symbolism and meaning in the movie midway through it when they started showing dinosaurs and flying though the universe.  I have never ever wanted to leave a theatre so bad in my life.  Afterwards the same friend sent me links posted by people trying to explain the meaning in certain scenes of the movie, I didn't care nor did I want to know, I was totally disgusted with this movie.",1318204800,13,757,4.4963503649635035
4304016,5,B004A8ZX32,"The last day in July is probably significant to many because it happens to be Harry Potter's birthday. To allow you all to completely ignore our collective nerdiness, we'll mention that this was also the day we saw The Tree of Life. Every now and then, there comes a film that completely knocks your socks off--The Tree of Life was that film for us. You could say that we expected to like it (or even felt that we had better  like it after having to deal with the excessive hype for so long. Luckily, we were not disappointed. Suffice it to say that we had what major cinephiles and those who happen to cheat death call an experience. The audience we sat with at our tiny little cinema was just as in awe of it as we were. We sat there silently, our eyes glued to the screen. By film's end, some were crying--yes, us included. Some walked out without saying anything at all, the dazed expression in their eyes communicating all they needed. Others nodded their heads gleefully. We were pumping our fists in the air in excitement. We ended up sitting on a bench outside, taking in the cool night air of the midnight hour and talking on and on about our experience before heading to a late dinner to talk about it some more. Sure, you can call us nerdy if you want. But The Tree of Life  was that beautiful, that profound, that effective. We had both just seen what is possibly the most life affirming film either of us had seen in our entire lives.

Sometimes life can be overbearingly hurtful and completely unfair in too many unforgivable ways. Many people try and find their own ways to remedy the pain and the sadness, whether it be from community contribution, art, work, religion, or simple birdhouse building. Sadly, it is not always this easy for some people to overcome their pain and their troubles. For many people, it is simply too overwhelming to comprehend the various harsh aspects of everyday life, and therefore the mere act of living begins to feel completely unsatisfactory. Finding the joy and the tranquility of being alive just doesn't seem to quite justify the troubles in the world. This is very obviously what Jack (Sean Penn) feels every single say when he wakes up and goes to his job as an architect. His brother died at the age of nineteen and he tells his father over the phone that he thinks about him everyday, a sign that this event caused him deep personal turmoil. It isn't until Jack sees a tree being planted that he begins to retreat back into his memories and then challenges himself. His memories are what take up the bulk of the picture as he goes back in time to the building blocks of his existence and the existence of the rest of the universe before reminiscing on his childhood, growing up with his two little brothers and his very affectionate and angelic mother and his strict and frustrating father in 1950s Texas. It is through this that he must discover the complexities of life's emotions and what they mean to him as a human being. What we see in his flashback is his personal attempt to try and make a rediscovery and reevaluation on his existence.

Before getting into this film, it'd be best to warn people that this is a very unorthodox picture, even by Terrence Malick standards. I'd say approximately half of the people who see it will dislike it, and many of the people who will like it will mostly still be somewhat puzzled. The reason for this is due to the editing. This film doesn't unfold in the same way that most films do. It is disjointed, nonsensical, ludicrous, and very fragmented. In other words, this is the kind of film all casual filmgoers, and most movie buffs even, should avoid unless they are will to watch the film with an open mind for theme. Many will say that films should not require audience preparation or learned experiences of any kind in order to be good. The thing is, many of those people who say that are right. For example, with a documentary like the Errol Morris picture The Fog of War, it is necessary to have knowledge and understanding of what happened during the Vietnam war, and therefore it will only be good for those people who do. The Tree of Life, however, doesn't really require any sort of knowledge to be viewed properly. You don't need to have read the bible or studied any type of scientific theory. It fact, the younger you are the better the film experience may be for you. This is because it's images and ideas will still seem very new and real. Since a lot of this film depicts childhood, I think children are going to be the audience the film will most resonate film.

Throughout the film, you'll see the entire universe get created, you'll see people reacting to death and to birth. You'll see people walking, running, smiling, crying, getting angry and abusive, and getting emotional and weakening in their stature. You'll see a set of parents marvel at the beauty that is their children and you'll see children marvel at the beauty of the world around them. You'll see the mother come up with creative and hilarious ideas to wake up her children, hug them, kiss them, run around playing with them, and even appearing in their dreams. You'll see the father hug them and kiss them as well, but not until he berates and hits them, scolds them, and lose his temper in his attempts to get them used to an often unforgiving and punishing world. This is a film that shows human existence at it's most natural. The world around these people is as much a character and the actual breathing characters. The animals, flowers, bugs, and nature are all flowing, fighting, and breathing just like these three boys and these two parents. This is all in accordance with the film's evident feelings toward Sean Penn's character and his difficulties with his existence. The film is trying to say that the world will not stop moving just for you to get over your miseries. Life keeps moving, and Jack has forgotten this. He has let himself drift into an otherworldly thought process in which nothing is good and that progress is simply digression disguised as something bigger and more important. You can see it in his cold eyes as he wanders around the modern world as casually and as carelessly as a dust cloud. In his scenes, when the camera follows him it is almost as if he is on a conveyor belt. This effect gives these scenes a real eerie sense of dread and distance that almost become overbearing.

Before going on, special mention must be made to the fact that this marks the first film in which Terrence Malick depicts the modern world. All of his films take place at different times in history, which indicates that Malick is a huge fan of history and period dramas. Mention of this is important because Malick's view of the modern world is very interesting. It's all so industrial and mechanical, but it's not entirely a negative view. In fact, I think it's a very positive one. The environment look and seem bigger and more important than life and the people within it, and yet there is a strange kind of nature to it as well that makes it seem more like a post-modern view. I get the impression that this depiction of the world of today is primarily intended to be less an omen and more a recording of what people remember about modern civilization in the early 21st Century. Because of this, the rest of the film feels even more hopeful as a result. Terrence Malick comes across as a man with a wide range of interests, much like Werner Herzog, and prefers to tell stories that contain more information, detail, style, and importance than what most people experience in their life. His films feel less like they're scripted and more like they're constructed from every thought and theme that comes to mind and seems relevant to the central tone and idea. It is with this that Malick then chooses to explore and outline what everything means before allowing these ideas to grow and develop within the storyline. It's a very odd technique and to be honest few can say that it is without problems. All of Terrence Malick's other films are challenging in their own little ways, with Badlands being the most simple and The New World being the most obtuse other than The Tree of Life. The fact that this film takes place in the modern world, however, makes it a landmark in Malick's ever growing body of work.

So then Sean Penn gets to see the tree being planted, and from there onward the film becomes a collection of whispered questions about the universe and about the creation of the universe and the creation of creation, which then dissolves into what is the most controversial, most complicated, most off-putting, and most challenging part of the entire work. The creation of everything. This is the part that will ultimately make or break the film for you. The creation of the universe is one of the weirdest, most terrifying, more bizarre, and most abstract sequences we have ever seen in a motion picture, and to call it beautiful would be an understatement. It's such a ridiculously overblown yet magically creative scene, that one cannot help but appreciate it simply because someone had the guts to go all the way with it. It features state of the art photographic effects work from Douglas Trumbull, the same man who did the abstract work for 2001. The sequence is completely bizarre, almost Kenneth Anger-esque, in it's loud, bright, violent, and endless way. Everything just explodes and builds an rebuilds. Bugs crawl out of bubbles, bubbles crawl out of stones, stones crawl out of fire, fire crawls out of the air, and all the while set to the most intense opera music you can imagine. The effect is roller coaster-like in it's horror. Yes, eventually you also see dinosaurs. Without talking too much about the dinosaurs (since everybody else seems to go bonkers over the fact that they are in this film), the intended effect and idea was solid enough for it to work. Who cares if something is CGI or not, as long as the idea works well enough to support the effect. Most people who have seen this film don't feel it does, but we do. Lets move on.

So then we enter the best part of the film, as well as the longest. We finally see Jack's childhood, and boy is it incredible to watch. As troublesome and as confusing as it is, it is in many ways the ideal childhood. Two very strong, very human, parental figures in a beautifully average neighborhood with wide roads and limitless adventure. The backyards stretch infinitely and nature seems to exist everywhere. The three young brothers, all very excellently cast (the three look very similarly alike), all seem perfectly healthy, loud, frantic, rambunctious, and sun burnt in addition to being overly violent to one another and unable to handle death very well. Jack, in particular ends up growing very confused by his developing feelings and emotions and ends up killing animals and vandalizing things. In other words, they are normal kids in a world where normality doesn't exist. Their father, Mr. O'Brien (played by Brad Pitt, in his best performance), is a loving man who is always showing affectionate and warm love to his children, but remains constantly strict and tough to them in order to prepare them for a harsh existence. He wants them to remain children and wants them to stay innocent without taking away their freedom, but he obviously feels that he would be doing them an even bigger service by allowing conflict, violence, and anger into their lives in order for the good things to be so much better. Since the film is from the child's point of view, much of the father behavior may come across as cruel and too strict and harsh. To be fair, however, most fathers do occasionally tend to go a little bit too far with their children. Terrence Malick, at times, seems afraid to explore relationships with the father and their children, but here he does it fearlessly without any hesitations or cliches. It's an honest and truthful exploration of the relationship between a father and his boys. Occasionally he fears he is being too overbearing, and even apologizes to Jack for it, to which Jack responds by defending his father's actions against him. In order to really understand the power of that scene, you simply have to see it.

Their mother, Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) is the perfect opposite to the rough and tough father. She is so beautiful, so childlike, and so full of energy, imagination, and fun that she almost comes across like one of their own kids. The scenes involving her are the best scenes in the film, and what a breath of fresh air it is to see such a wonderful, uncomplicated, and joyful character in modern art. Often times, characters are either sharply one way or sharply the other. Her character is simple and beautiful without coming across as false or characterized. She has very abundant and strong emotional reactions to the world around her, which leads us to believe that in the past she has had it intensely rough throughout the course of the film she is re-experiencing a childhood that she never had through her own children. This makes her a somewhat flawed character in concept, but in execution she is perhaps the greatest woman you could ever meet in your life. Besides, perfection is overrated. That Chastain could communicate all of this is absolutely astounding. Her performance is stellar, gorgeous. Her beauty is exquisite. These two things combine to create the best performance by an actress we have seen in quite some time. Chastain is powerful, moving, utterly earth shattering. She is the emotional core of The Tree of Life and the one aspect that continues to stick in our minds above all the others. Thank you Miss Chastain for moving us to tears. Thank you Miss Chastain for allowing us to fall so utterly in love with you as the film's very own guardian angel. And thank you Miss Chastain, for gracing us with your presence. Watching you work was so raw, so personal that it felt like we were right there in the room with you, watching relate a story to good friends. That you can transport us as well as embrace us makes you dynamite in our book.

As the film nears it's end, the structure of the film becomes less disjointed and more elegant in it's approach to life and humanity. The twenty minute finale is something that we will not spoil except that it is one of the best finales to any film made in the last sixty years and it truly drives home what the film is about. Life cannot progress without weaknesses, desires, fears, mistakes, and most importantly, death. All of these things are good things in many ways because they strengthen what people triumph and feel proud about in life. The discovery of a lost pet. The new found respect shown by someone who you didn't think noticed your integrity (to do the right thing, not caring if people know). The resurgence of a new idea after a large scale plan falls through. The mistakes that allow you to meet new people and grow new friendships and relationships. The loss of a good friend who you realize causes you more pain than you realized. The arrival at a new place that gives you the chance to start all over with no mistakes. The accidental pregnancy that leads you to give birth to the new love of your life. In the end, there are no such things as primarily good or primarily bad things. Good and bad things come and grow out of everything, and it is up to you to take the bad with the good. The violent death of a sibling that you love and care deeply about is a painful thing to deal with, but it will also give you the chance to start your life again with the memories of people who you've been with as far back as you can remember. Death is not defeat, and just because a person dies does not mean that they don't exist. They exist in memories, in thoughts, and in who you and who the people around you are. You can see it as spiritual or as ethical, but until you learn to except death, life will pass by without you. This is what the ending of the picture meant to us.

No film is perfect, and so while we can say that we love every aspect of the film in all of it's ridiculously overblown, ambitious, and bizarre glory, we cannot or stress how unorthodox the picture is. There will be at least one aspect of the film people don't like. There are those who may not like the Sean Penn sequences, but they'll like the creation sequences. There are those who may love the childhood scenes but may strongly dislike the ending. Then there are those who may end up loving the ending, but won't get to it because they'll walk out during the creation scenes. Or someone may love the Sean Penn material and the creation scenes, but then the second half of the film comes up with the childhood and the existential ending and they'll totally tune out. Then there are those who will love the whole film, but will get annoyed by the flame of light that keep coming up and appearing throughout the film. There are Atheists who will hate the film for it's religious overtones and vise-versa. There are those who will love all the material but will be completely uninterested in the Sean Penn scenes. It will be very hard for most people to love every aspect of the film, and it'll be an even bigger challenge for many of those people to even begin to at the very least appreciate the material they hate. However, that is what good art does. It challenges, it provokes argument, thoughts, and feelings, and above all it entertains.

Of all the ambitious motion pictures made since the creation of the movie camera, this is one of the most ambitious of them all. In the past three decades, there have been countless films made by big time directors whose goal is to make a large scale motion picture based on something either highly personal, highly ambitious, or highly experimental that is said to be inspired by Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Some examples include John Boorman's Zardoz, Gus Van Sant's Gerry, Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood, Nicholas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, Christopher Nolan's Inception, Gaspar Noe's Enter the Void, and most particularly Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain. Most of these pictures are either flawed or failed experiments that show plenty of potential, originality, and brilliance. Only one of them came extremely close to achieving what 2001 achieves (the Nicholas Roeg picture). Now we have this film, The Tree of Life, which manages to equal 2001 in it's power, it's emotion, it's ideas, it's intensity, and it's beauty. Terrence Malick's masterpiece is one of the greatest accomplishments in filmmaking history, progressing the storytelling movement to a whole new level that few films have come close to quite topping. The performances are shattering and revolutionary, the photography is already legendary, and the musical score in particular is just as perfect as the film itself. This will be a film that will be remembered for a long time afterward, and we can truly hope that more filmmakers can make films like this, because filmmaking is still in it's infancy and it can change the world as long as it continues to grow and develop. This is easily the best picture of the decade. This is as good as films get.",1318204800,15,19197,4.623094958968347
4304047,5,B004A8ZX32,"The movie is awesome, but I am blown away, and more than a little bit disheartened, by how angry people get watching something like this. Is it because it is just so far over their head that their lack of understanding makes them feel stupid and they react by lashing out and making a scene? Is it just this Fox News mentality of abusing something that thinks differently than you? Whatever it is, I dislike it immensely. I was dragged to see Transformers 2 a year ago and it was the worst movie experience of my life. I endured the whole thing and didn't have the urge to run out half way through calling everyone dumb on the way out. We've become deeply intolerant it seems.",1318204800,6,676,4.373015873015873
4304048,5,B004A8ZX32,"I went into this BD presentation with an open mind - hoping for the utmost best and not knowing of the elements included. When the credits rolled though, I had my expectations of sound and picture exceeded in ways I had not even thought to foresee.

Skipping the analogies and descriptions of those much wiser than me that analyze the depths of comprehension they all try to obtain in what he made here, I will stick with a product description. The picture clarity is without hesitation one of the best overall preservation pieces I have seen along any spectrum of what this film records: facial close-ups, skylines, spacial explorations, nature, urbanscapes, tears, moving water, dinosaurs, etc. I pause checked each variety of representations and could not find any faults - point being that he obviously had the budget when making this film, so this BD can prove the worth of your home theater whether testing lights, darks, movement or line clarity.

The 7.1 sound immerses even more than Thin Red Line, to such a point that I wish I could include a picture I took of the opening frame that stated (for the first time that I know of in film): ""For optimal sound reproduction, the producers of this Blu Ray recommend you play it loud"". I played it extremely loud and have never been so pleased in how every single channel was used perfectly.

The supplements are scant, but the main inclusion should almost be watched first to help one with understanding what is being presented here. I showed this 29-minute piece to several viewers first and I actually found that there was a better comprehension and appreciation for what he was doing here than watching it without any foreknowledge. The 2nd disc is a bare bones DVD converted down to 5.1 Dolby. Disc 3 is a standard Dig Copy. Region coded A.

If you are sitting on the fence about this film, at least you will not be disappointed in the Blu, truly a keeper for the home library for a variety of reasons.",1318032000,3,1960,4.65606936416185
4304049,1,B004A8ZX32,"While the title itself serves as the first red flag, this was somehow overlooked by enthused anticipators of the elusive Malick's next feature film.  Something so generic sounding was clearly disregarded purely due to the fact of the acclaimed director's reputation as generally unconventional.  His previous works merit him the luxury of uncritical early reception, which is why no second thought was given to the cringingly simplistic title.  It is only in retrospect when this even presents itself as problematic to a work intending to be grandly philosophical and theological.

Throughout the entire movie, lies a tone of uncertainty and heartbreak though it is never specifically explored. Malick intends for the assumption to be held that this underlying, vague human torment is highly significant and universally relatable, and therefore should not be questioned.  Given, a movie should not hold the viewer's hand during the process of making interpretations and conclusions, but neither should it offer only one possible set of emotions and conclusions.  Upon watching this, we are supposed to feel the simplest forms of sadness and aimlessness without room for a wider range of alternatives. Though a bit of information is revealed early on about the death of a son, it is never discussed in a properly philosophical context.  Instead, a stream of clichs spews from this point on and marks the beginning of this film's disappointingly generic worldview.  While the movie intermittently features whispered narrations of various tortured characters questioning God--in simplistic fashion, of course--it never intends for a critical voice to turn against it in questioning why certain emotions are supposed to be felt.  A very one-dimensional view of growing up in a traditional 1950's household is seemingly the source of the deep suffering which leads to such profound theological doubt.  The father is strict and meant to be feared by his children, the mother is passive yet maternal and meant to be lovingly pitied by her children.  This historically conventional family structure presents itself--unconvincingly--as the cause behind contemplating the meaning of life.

An extension of delving into this broad, unthoughtful mediation on life features an unnecessarily long montage of abstract, nature images in desperate need of some proper editing--ironic since the film credits a total of five different editors.  It seems Malick was torn between making a nature documentary, a space exploration, and a narrative film. Naturally, he combined all three to make an incohesive, pretentious jumble of images clearly thought to be received as revolutionary and thought-provoking.  When he's not posturing as a National Geographic documentarian, Malick puts on his best impression of the untouchable Stanley Kubrick himself.  ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" stands the test of time and continues to marvel across generations without hollow flourishes forcing generic wordviews into the broad realm of art.  Needless to say, such a revolutionary landmark in the history of film did not need to be remade.  Countless number of films have derived significant influence from Kubrick's masterpiece, but there remains a distinct difference between subtle hints of inspiration and obvious attempts at redoctoring.  Trying to connect the cosmic history of Earth and life on it with the insignificance of one seemingly troubled American family proves incredibly feeble and a mere trifle in the grander scheme the film aimlessly hovers above.  The surprising addition of computer-generated dinosaurs firmly attests to the fact that Malick's vision lacks cohesive direction, appearing rather silly.  He overwhelmingly emphasizes the abstract imagery, so much so that the actors never believably connect with the material or with one another, thus preventing the viewer to connect with or care about the characters.  Rather than encouraging organic development between the characters and their environment, Malick pursues his own selfish mode of high-brow artistry.

With Malick's next project planned for release next year, it won't be long before disappointed viewers witness his next ""revolutionary"" undertaking; ""Godfather"" remade in 3D perhaps.",1318032000,19,4235,5.56386292834891
4304050,5,B004A8ZX32,"Forget what you think you know about movies or film-making, or how a film should be made.  In order to enjoy this, you have to leave all your expectations of convention at the door.  The Tree of Life is more than just a movie, and I mean that in the most literal way possible: it is expression through film, a work of art, a piece of music, a visual odyssey, and more than anything, a philosophical meditation. It does not have a plot in the conventional sense and there is no obvious conflict-resolution so to speak.  Because the film is not even aiming to accomplish either of these, I don't think it's fair to give it a bad rating for not doing so; it's just not the point Malick had in mind.

It may help to consider that for a good portion of Malick's life, he was a philsophy professor at MIT.  This is a man who thinks...a lot.  He's concerned with the big ideas: the meaning of life, the origin of life, questions about God, questions about nature, beauty, art, and so on.  If you are interested in these things too, you might love this movie; if not, you will probably hate it and find it very boring.

I watched it in the theater twice.  The music together with the visuals is what really got me.  More than anything, this film is impressionistic.

4304056,5,B004A8ZX32,"What I can't understand is actually the fuss surrounding this film.  People aren't just confused by it, they're acting offended by it.  Apparently audiences in a lot of showings were yelling at the screen and snapping at people who tried to shush them.  This movie was unusual, but I don't get what caused people to be so actively offended by it when they can sit through most movies, ambitious or otherwise, without any real problem.  Is it the norm in our culture now to react to unexpected or strange images on the screen by getting angry and yelling?  Could I just go out on a limb and say that if you leave before a film's over or spend the entire time yelling at the screen, I have no respect for your opinion of the film?

Chimps parading as people aside, I at least enjoyed the movie.  I saw it late in its run so I never had to worry about an audience yelling at the screen.

I'm the kind of person who's patient.  If a movie confuses me I don't flip out or start yelling and ranting; I sit it out.  So that's what I did with this movie.  I tried my best to see what Malick was doing, because I think it's pretty obvious that such a respected filmmaker would have seen at least some reason for making this movie.

First of all, there's one major reason why this film isn't for everyone and it's not one I've heard anyone else mention:

The film, from top to bottom, is extremely musical.  I mean that in many ways, but let me be clearer:  The father in the family the story focuses on wanted to be a conductor and dropped off that career path in favor of a secure job.  The soundtrack is all very carefully-chosen classical music.

And if you zoom out far enough, the overall structure of the film is actually a very musical one - you could almost see it as some insane variant on sonata form.  It's hard to describe, but visual themes resurface at various times in the film in ways that feel very similar to recapitulations in music.

As I said; not for everyone.  I picked up on this stuff, but I'm a musician.  I loved it.

As far as the images of dinosaurs and the cosmos interspersed in it, my impression was that Malick was trying to show cycles of creation, longing and destruction in frameworks other than those of humans.  As I saw it - and this is up for debate - I read the movie as showing a very eastern sort of philosophy; one that involves a sort of reincarnation or continuation beyond the lives and deaths of individuals, species, or even planets.

Call that pretentious if you want, I thought it was done very nicely, though, and I'm very decidedly buying it as soon as it's out on DVD.

Also, I don't get why people bothered yelling at the scenes of the cosmos.  If you didn't get it, I still think it was some of the most beautiful visuals I've seen in a film in a really long time.  Relax.  It's pretty.",1316908800,432,2833,4.284369114877589
4304097,5,B004A8ZX32,"This is it ladies and gentlemen, the moment that a handful of people have been waiting for, The Tree of Life. Really it's almost a miracle that this film didn't come off of the backbone of a 20 year hiatus just as The Thin Red Line did. Seeing as this film is larger in scope that all four of his previous films combined (Which, good Lord, I truly didn't think that was possible). In this film director Terrence Malick covers everything from the infinite to the infinitesimal with utter grace and passion. This is the epitome of a Terrence Malick film, from the opening frames through to the final ones, everything about this film proclaims a perfection of craft for Malick. This feels like the film he's been trying to make throughout his career. It is hard to really comprehend and recant just how graceful this film is. Even when nothing is particularly happening to move the plot forward, the viewer always feels Malick's omnipotent spirituality on every frame. Malick's films have always done a wonderful job of resonating with the audience in a very unique way, but it seems he won't settle for mere resonance anymore, he's aiming for transcendence, to create a true piece of art in every sense of the word. A film that not only poses questions, but for some, may provide answers.

Lovers of narrative beware, because there isn't much of it to be found here. For the most part, The Tree of Life grips the viewer on a more thematic and emotional level in a way that a conventional plot couldn't achieve. I hear a lot of critics referring to echoes of  '2001: A Space Odyssey' as an obvious influence, and I would have to agree. However what really differentiates the two is Malick's sense of the spiritual, the passion for and the nostalgia of human experience, and the aching need to understand it and not only accept but transcend it. From the films frequent references to the book of Job (which the two really share quite a bit in common, thematically speaking) to images of dinosaurs grazing on a shore, to cells multiplying, to the relationship and internal struggle between a father and his son, between man and God, there isn't a single forgettable moment in The Tree of Life.

Malick's use of the O'Brien family (in particular Jack's voyage into adulthood) works as a perfect archetype for all human behavior and understanding, it is doubtful that one will find they cannot relate to these people. The father with his wisdom, anger, principles and strict disciplinary actions, and the mother representing a more forgiving, affectionate and benevolent kind of parent. Jack's odyssey and his eventual understanding of his parent's flaws and his angst is a surprisingly broad representation of the human impulse to fight against the universe, to conquer it, to be completely secure and in control of one's own existence.

The film's epilogue (or coda or whatever you'd care to call it) is really the most perplexing and arguably ambitious sequence in the film. It is interesting to note that really, in any other filmmaker's hands the film would have ended with Jack's internal struggle unresolved. However Malick chooses to take one bold step further, with a rather mystifying sequence which will leave room for many audience interpretations, although it's place and intention is clear: To help us make peace with our own demons. If that isn't the true essence of art, then what is?",1316822400,15,3393,4.8147512864493995
4304098,5,B004A8ZX32,"With this wonderful staging, I must admit that Terence Malik surpassed all previous expectations. A leisurely-paced film, meditative character, deeply introspective, imbued with a poetic image like few films in the past.

One feels the influence of Andei Tarkovsky (Sacrifice) over this radiant visual spectacle, where the words are secondary, the images spanning a character within magnificence of nature pastoral, that literally captivates and mesmerizes.

When a middle class family suffers the terrible misfortune of the death of a child, the film as it were, through the resource implodes. An ellipsis narrative, we witnessed yesterday and now as a warp. The stage of childhood, the dream Unamuno, the primary concerns at the image of an authoritarian father, the silent complicity of silence and a mother who supports her children's antics.

Malick uses large symphonic pieces of eloquent expression, to delineate the tapestry of existence, full of deep spirituality, such as suggestive of the autumn carat Fourth Symphony of Johannes Brahms, the renowned The Moldau by Smetana, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor Bach, the Pictures at an exhibition of Mussorgsky and a section of a sonata Mozartiana.

Rightly, the film in Cannes swept quite rightly receiving the Palme d'Or for best film. I just hope that this film received a similar responsiveness on this side of the Atlantic, although I have my serious doubts.

It is very impressive with beautiful filming and great acting. But the story is hard to get a grip on. It challenges you, ""What is the director trying to tell me now?"" question often came to my mind. I think I have kind of sorted it out, but also have come to terms with that there are parts I don't understand, and that's OK.

It is life, it is death, it is the joy you feel, and the sorrow you regret.  This movie has deeply moved me.  It has pushed me to forgive those who I have not been able to forgive, and love more than I thought I could ever grasp.  I feel it moving inside me still.  If you are looking for a film to carry you to a higher realm this is the one.  For any naysayer, you are thinking of it in a very shallow way, you need to let go of all the ideas that a movie is supposed to be and let this wash over you like a tide and take it as it is.

(Hint: Listen to the words during the Dinosaur scenes, they reflect our crying out and questioning of ""God"" when we are alone and hurt. with the voice over addressing god again, saying ""where are you"". this scene exemplifies the scenario which ALL beings face when confronted with pain and suffering: ""why is this happening to me? where is god? don't i mean something in the scheme of life? aren't i important enough to save? why doesn't god seem to care about my suffering?"" )

Jack (Penn) does the same and does what he can to attempt to restore his relationship with his father. This is not a movie for everybody. This movie is filled with symbolism and I am not smart enough to understand all of it. The first half is basically just showing life in various stages (you will see what I mean when you watch it). When it gets to the scenes with Brad Pitt it begins to pick up, but still is slow. I'd compare it to the ""Fountain"" in the fact that the movie seemed to be artsy & overly intelligent for the sake of being artsy & overly intelligent.

This is not normal for me, most films i appreciate for their plot and direction but this movie made me wonder about the role of human life and if we are here for a reason, or if we are just a fluke.

Mallick directs this film masterfully. Mallick puts together a huge variety of images that generate sensations that together form a unifying theory of life and what it means to be human. The acting is phenomenal with Brad Pitt doing an excellent job representing nature that seems to not care very much for humanity, and Jessica Chastain representing the way of grace and kindness that we all see in each other to some degree or another. the character played by Sean Penn and Hunter McCracken represents what happens when one is conflicted between the two ideologies represented by his/her parents. The film shows that these questions and insecurities go beyond childhood and can plague a person into their adult life. Words cannot describe this movie, just as sometimes they cannot describe a feeling.

This movie is not for everyone however.

I'm a Wes Anderson, Charlie Kaufman, and David Lynch fan. Although this movie is directed nothing like their films I find the expression of inner struggle that draws me to their movies somehow similar. I've not seen Malick's other movies, but plan to check them out.

I've found either you are deeply moved by The Tree of Life or deeply bored with it. It does not speak to the Ego as much as to the Id and Superego in that it's not a movie to see for entertainment but for thought provocation and evocation of our spirit.

Visually
The imagery was stunning, the directing evocative.

Audibly
The soundtrack is perfect - haunting, brilliant, and dark at just the right times.

Emotionally
I found myself deeply relating to the emotion of this film. The frustration of the father and the son. The love of the mother and middle son. The solidity of the youngest brother. The power of nature.

Spiritually
I have wrestled with the questions of life and God just as the hero. Nature vs Grace. Science vs Spirituality.

4304110,5,B004A8ZX32,"It's not often one gets to encounter a well funded, high production film starring big name actors that is completely at odds with the normal expectations of mainstream filmmaking. That's because we're dealing with an artist here. I have seen all of Terence Malick's work over the years and in my opinion, ""Tree of Life"" is his best film since the magnificent ""Days of Heaven"". The latter film has had a permanent place in my own Top 10 for many years.

""The Tree of Life"" is an altogether different experience but with all the stylistic hallmarks of this visionary director. Many moviegoers are disappointed by this film and that's mostly because of their pre-programmed Hollywood type expectations of what a movie should be like. A film requires a linear plot, a story that goes somewhere. A story with protagonists and antagonists all steadily building towards a resolution at the end. ""Tree of Life"" doesn't have any of this and the audience member who is unfamiliar with this director will be squirming in their seat and asking, ""When will something happen already?""

The fact is that a lot happens in this film. A lot more than in most films that you'll see. The history of the universe, galaxies, clusters, exploding stars... the evolution of plant and animal life on Earth... all of this is juxtaposed with a peak into the life of a suburban family in Middle America circa the 1950s and the adult son of that family in our present day. As usual Malick picked some big movie stars to work with and although I am not much of a fan of Brad Pitt, let alone Sean Pean ( with all his annoying politics ), both actors are completely subsumed into the rhythm of the film and their personas fade away. Pitt really does seem like a 50s era American patriarch, ruling the house and raising up his three boys to be men. Sean Penn, who plays one of Pitt's sons as an adult, wanders through the film like a ghost amidst the glass and steel structures of a modern metropolis.

There are many awe-inspiring sequences in the film. Some of my favorites are the creation-evolution sequence that goes on for like 15 minutes with the total absence of humanity. We even see dinosaurs and the C.G.I. work is pretty good, not Jurassic Park, but still effective. The shot of the dying sea creature on the beach is stunning. The use of classical composers by Malick is just as daring as in his last picture ""The New World"". In that movie, there was the sublime use of Wagner and Mozart that stood out. In ""Tree of Life"", we get a whole roll call of composers ranging from Bach, Brahms, Couperin, Mahler, Gorecki, Tavener, Berlioz, Smetana and many more. The Couperin piece was one of the most effective as the young children run around in the field and play. The emotions of childhood innocence and deep nostalgia are invoked. I was very moved throughout the film and the conclusion on the beach was quite extraordinary.

There is the use of narration in the film as well, just like in all of Malick's work. This time our narrators ask questions about life, long for God, contemplate existence. Basically the kinds of things mainstream movies brush off as unexciting fluff and just focus on the next car chase, shoot out or explosion. If you have any appreciation of serious artistic work in the field of the movies, make sure not to miss this beautiful film. There aren't that many comparisons out there. Beyond Malick's own films, there is probably ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as a close relative but even that would be a faulty comparison because Malick's film is so humanistic and loving while ""2001"" is much colder and abstract.

A week after seeing ""Tree of Life"", I went 180 degrees the other way and saw ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" in IMAX 3D. ( Hey, give me a break... I had a free pass. ) Transformers 3 is a fun, dumb summer spectacle full of razzle and dazzle. What a contrast to a spiritual, profound work like The Tree of Life. Sometimes a study in contrasts is a fun exercise for the moviegoer. I just wonder if people who love the Transformers films could appreciate the wonder of Tree of Life as well. Most unfortunately cannot. Oh well... I expect the Blu-ray will be a great memento to this sublime film.",1314489600,16,4205,4.608811748998665
4304111,5,B004A8ZX32,"Terrence Malick's fifth feature is a mystifying and contemplative cinematic experience with a focus on the nature of good and evil, grace versus nature, god and his absence, love, grief, innocence, reconciliation and human existence all observed at times at a cosmic scale but mostly with intimate detail. Though far from containing a conventional narrative, the story within the enigmatic pondering of ""The Tree of Life"" revolves around Jack O'Brien, first seen as a wary middle aged man in modern times. He awakes one morning after he apparently dreams of his parents on the anniversary of the death of his brother who he loved deeply; a death that still troubles him. As he goes about his day working his corporate job the death of his sibling weighs heavily on him. Jack then begins, as he has probably done countless times before, to search for answers to that overburdening question `Why? Why do we die and what is the purpose of life'. Questions asked in hopes to better understand his loss and reconcile his grief.

The search for the answer, which inevitably questions god's existence, starts where one tends to look for something, the beginning. We are quickly transported to the very first moments of the creation of the universe and travel forward through time to the formation of earth, the dawn of living organisms at a microscopic level and eventually complex life forms. Next we get to the real center of the story as we witness the birth and childhood of Jack. This entire story is observed through Jacks memories of living in a small town in Texas during the 50's. I believe it is very important to consider that these scenes are told through his memory and so contain a dreamlike and visceral atmosphere. We are not watching it play out as a narrative would in any other film; instead we get fragments of his childhood, each an individual memory strung together as they flow through Jack's mind. The fact that these are memories also helps in understanding the view of his parents and the way in which they represent the sides of grace and nature to such extremes; as in Malick's ""Days of Heaven"" one questions whether they are a true representation of the characters or just how Jack remembers them so many years later.

Jessica Chastain plays `Mother', the way of grace, as a free spirited, caring and nurturing guide who teaches love, forgiveness and the enjoyment of life. The dueling force is nature, played incredibly well by Brad Pitt, as the disciplinarian father figure who runs his family with an iron fist in an attempt to instill toughness and a yearning for achieving greatness through any means. Together they reflect the inner workings of the cosmos and have a profound influence on Jack and at times he struggles to find a balance. As he grows he witnesses the harshness of the world around him, experiencing jealousy, lust, death and is often tempted by evil and sinful thoughts. At the same time however these struggles help him to grow and understand life and he comes to express a deep love and fondness for his family, especially his brother, though his mind still questions many things as it does for us all.

As expected with any Malick film the events in Jack's life are not a direct depiction of reality, and Malick really doesn't care much about their outcomes or how the story unfolds in a literal sense; instead what matters is making the audience experience these events through the inner mind and consciousness of the characters. As with his other work he relies heavily on voice over narration to convey the intimate thoughts of these characters, but this time they seem to be speaking for us and not just for themselves. All of this is constructed within a very visual backdrop with breathtakingly beautiful imagery utilizing lights, shadows, sounds, CGI, nature and settings with such perfection only a true artist like Malick could achieve giving even the most simple images complex meaning.

Together it is all truly poetry in motion and though it is a term I have used many times before it has never been more fitting. The entire film is unlike any other I have seen, one that will rattle your perspective on the world. Personally, the entire experience challenged me emotionally, mentally and spirituality; I'm not a religious man and I understand the examination of Christian values and Gods part in the story but the spiritualism at play I believe transcended religion or faith and although it looks to god for answers and at times tries to explain his actions, the thematic outcomes are open to so much interpretation that to claim you know the answer would undermine the films intentions. In the end there are no definitive answers; in the bigger picture of things we live but a small moment in time. One of the final scenes depicts what is seen to be `heaven' but not in a literal sense. God does not show his presence, and it isn't located among the clouds. One does not encounter angels and no answers are given to such complex questions like `Why are we here?"", instead there are only the ones we love as we remember them. Heaven is merely the place within our hearts where we cherish the memories of the past and it is in those memories and through those people we lived them with that we find a meaning and a reason to love and live. It is there where one finds true reconciliation, understanding and peace and by films end that is what Jack and the audience get. It is such a powerful and poignant culmination of everything that comes before it and one cannot help but be moved by it all.

I should mention that Pitt's character genuinely believes that the world is a `survival of the fittest' sort of place, which plays a big part in his personality and how he treats his children. But at the same time he does want love and there is evidence of a level of grace within him, maybe because his father and mother represented the same sort of divide between grace and nature, instilling these sorts of things on him and though he tried to rejected certain aspects and struggled to find a balance like Jack his father's views were too strong and had the big impact on him. Now he is doing the same to his children whom I think at times he understands and possibly regrets but honestly thinks it is for the best. I think it does sort of show just how Pitt's character's parents had a similar effect on him (this struggle between toughness/love; mother vs./ father) which gets passed down throughout the generations, especially at that time in history when we tend to viewed father figures as disconnected and tough workers and mothers as simply caring nurturers.

I do think it is his best performance. There is so much complexity; he isn't just this authoritarian father figure, though on the surface that is what we see. He strongly has a desire to make it in the world and do the best for his family, but the only way he knows how is to be aggressive and when that creates a divide or he doesn't succeed you can see the disappoint and you understand the pain it must bring to him so he becomes a very sympathetic character and Pitt plays him all too well, expressing so much pain and anger in his face and movements. I would love to see him nominated for this role.

Jessica Chastain puts on just as wonderful of a performance playing the mother. This has a lot to be with her just being such a beautiful and elegant individual in real life and so was easily able to embody the character of `grace'. I must also mention Hunter McCracken who is just fantastic as Jack's childhood image. A young actor whose eyes seemed to express years of pain and deep thought, a rare thing.

Overall ""The Tree of Life"" will undoubtedly divide the general film going audience. In the showing I attended I saw one couple walk out while at the same time as the final scenes began to play a woman in front of me was in tears. No one will be affected in the same way as others; those with no previous experience with Malick's work might find the whole thing pretentious, difficult to understand and hard to sit through which is very understandable. Those with a bit of patience and an open mind will bear witness to what might possibly be one of the most ambitious, beautiful and best films ever that will stick with you long after you leave the theater and will be discussed and analyzed for years to come.",1314403200,12,8352,4.630904183535763
4304112,1,B004A8ZX32,"I went to see the new film The Tree of Life this week. I was very excited since the film was just screened at Cannes and here I was seeing the same film here in Sacramento a few days later. Of course I also heard that the audience boo'd the film at the end which is very much not typical for the Cannes Film festival. The last time I remember hearing something like that was when they showed Marie Antoinette at the Venice Film Festival. In the case of Marie Antoinette the audience was right, yet a repeat was not making me turn back. I was seeing this movie and that was that.

When i arrived at the theatre there were only five other critics there and we were all looking forward to the film even though we all had heard about the screening at Cannes. The movie starts out very mysteriously with an out of focus shot that almost looks like a child's fort under a bed sheet with a mumbled whispering going on all around us. At this point the movie just lost me. The film is not linear so what appears to be a storyline just becomes random shots of this family on any given day. At one point the mother in the film gets a telegram telling her one of her sons in dead ... I don't know which one nor at this point do I care. Sean Penn comes on screen as one of the brothers grown up and he mumbles something about his brother being dead (which had to have happen 30 years prior) and then he does a lot of aimless staring. All of a sudden he's on a beach ... there is a door. He walks through it and at that point we see what had to have been at least 30 minutes of the creation. Planets and suns being born in a cosmic opera ... at this point I'm really fighting sleep. The music and the darkness in the theatre mixed with my complete confusion made shut down. If it weren't for me thinking about getting lunch I probably would have had about a two hour nap.

When we came back from the Hubble telescope free for all we got more boring moments in this families life for what felt like hours. I'm not really sure what this thing was about and i don't care. I've read other critics thoughts on this and many are glowing on what a master filmmaker Terrence Malik is but I don't see it. I'm not a fan of any of his previous work and after my torturous afternoon, I never will be. I can't come up with any BS about how he toys with our imagination and that's why he's a genesis ... I have to go the way of the Emperor's New Clothes. I can't fake praise for this film. I can't pull some clever comments out of my ass to make it sound like I felt his art. I have to call it for what it is ... a turd. A big smelly turd.",1314316800,29,2611,4.009596928982726
4304113,5,B004A8ZX32,"Little can be said about Malick's ""The Tree of Life,"" because there are so many words that must be written to mostly defend it from an audience that didn't like it. I'm not here as one of those reviewers; I'm here to tell you why I loved it, because that's what matters with this film: the impact it has on each viewer.

I read one synopsis of this film before I watched it in theaters, and thought okay, ""it's about a loss of innocence."" Boy, was that the wrong synopsis. This film captures--the Universe, the creation, the life, the emotion, the spirit. Yes, from the very moment of creation, through the time of the dinosaurs, until it stops in a small Texas town with a family of five. This is where the film gives me hope. I say this, because as I watched the images of the creation of the Universe and the images of space, I sank into my seat, and told myself: ""We are just like a grain of salt in this Universe, each and everyone of us.""

As we are sent to the town with the family, I felt a glimmer of hope. Each person, each family, each town, they create life and give it meaning. For the entirety of the creation of the Universe you feel no other emotion, and put no thought into pain, suffering, jealousy, or any other human emotion. But it is in that home with that family, that the human connection is made. I will not say anymore about the events that unfold in that home, only that it is the most natural acting, and quite possibly the greatest onscreen family that has been captured onscreen. Pitt portrays a stern father, not an abusive one as some people will try to have you believe. Chastain portrays the playful, loving mother. They provide a balance in the cruel world that awaits their children.

I saw what I saw, I felt what I felt, and I cannot explain anymore. Maybe you should give it another try, or maybe this was not the film for you, and you want to give it one-star. That's okay too.

If you've seen any of director Terrence Malick's (Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line) films and didn't care for them then there's probably a fair chance you will not like The Tree of Life, but maybe you will gain respect and admiration for his craft.  The one thing that often divides Malick devotees from those indifferent to the director's films is his cinematic language.  Like all of four of his films, Tree of Life is an exercise in show before tell, a love of nature, an examination of interpersonal relationships and a fondness for purity. More than anything Malick wants us to feel his picture.

In fact, The Tree of Life marks Malick's movement towards the abstract and surreal.  Quite often Malick prefers to convey feeling through montage, facial expressions, subtle gestures or even the now famous creation sequence.  Just like his previous efforts it's a film which could easily be reworked as a silent picture and not miss a beat - a very high compliment.  It's also comparable to The Thin Red Line in its narrative approach but much more free and loose.  More than ever before Malick is less concerned with plot and more concerned with conveying feeling.

The first time I saw The Tree of Life was on its release date.  I was overwhelmed by the film's brilliant imagery, its poignant score and its examination of the life of a family in a sleepy town in Texas in the 1960's.  Malick's focus on the three boys all close in ages and practically on the cusp of adolescence felt incredibly intimate, honest and relatable. Growing up the middle child of three boys I found myself relating to the joys and pain felt by the boys growing up.

Naturally, these boys grew up in a time when the father was the disciplinarian dishing out tough love.  Brad Pitt is superb as Mr. O'Brien or simply ""father"" or ""sir"" as he demands his sons to politely call him.  Mr. O'Brien believes anything is possible in life with a lot of hard work and a fierce will.  He demands they do what is right even though he doesn't always fulfill his words to a tee because he wants them to be prepared to be the boss when they grow up.  The ethereal Jessica Chastain's sweet and nave mother is often the foil (sometimes to the chagrin of Mr. Obrien) to the boys' father.  Her thoughts and inner feelings are expressed through her beautifully natural face. Together both parents find ways to make it all work.

Malick's portrayal of life from birth to the boys' late childhood is exceptionally moving.  The way he shows the early years of a child's life could make a stone cry and the longest of faces smile.  Then Malick shows us the boys start to think for themselves, get into mischief, have difficulty coping with disappointment and finding themselves attracted to girls - it's all there and Malick presents it all so tenderly and vividly.

There's the bad - when one of the sons gets the gumption to tell his father to be quiet at the dinner table and Mr. O'Brien gets worked up in a rage and demands his son to leave the dinner table.  There's the fun - when the boys get into the type of mischief that only boys can do and the proverbial schoolyard scenes Malick accompanies with a poignant piano piece.

Then there's the irreplaceable.  Consider a scene in which the father, a once aspiring musician but now a plant worker, is playing the organ and he glances over to see his young son already excelling at playing the guitar.  The look of pride on the father's face is priceless.  It's something as a kid I could never grasp because I couldn't see myself through my father's eyes to see the love and pride he had when he saw me succeed.  Just as it meant everything to me to play sports well, it meant the world to my father to see me do well.

Much of the pre-release buzz over The Tree of Life concerned its lengthy creation sequence detailing the formation of Earth and existence and demise of dinosaurs. I've left discussion of this sequence to the end of this review because it compliments the story, rather than the story supplementing the creation sequence. The CGI visuals, of which Douglass Trumbull (2001: A Space Odyssey) had a part in, are spectacular to be precise, but naturally Malick's hand maintains restraint and doesn't let them veer into spectacle. I've seen The Tree of Life twice and I'm still processing my thoughts as to how this sequence and the story fit into place (Which is not a bad thing as the film has so much substance).  There's also the present day urban skyscraper-set story of the eldest son Jack (Sean Penn) who's recalling his childhood, his parents and the loss of one his brothers at a young age. Penn doesn't need to emote because his face, his body language and Malick's direction juxtaposing small town Texas with the steel and glass urban environment of Jack's work environment are more than enough.

To be sure, The Tree of Life is not for everyone. One has to buy into Malick's cinematic language from the start or be lost in the stream of memories, feelings and sometimes surrealism.  It's also clear the film has a religious element but one's faith shouldn't prevent appreciation of this picture.  I think it's much too soon to rank this film's place within the Malick oeuvre, because it will no doubt be discussed and dissected endlessly in the years to come. All in all, Malick has never disappointed and The Tree of Life is no exception to this rule.",1314144000,6,5412,4.587746625129803
4304115,5,B004A8ZX32,"If you are familiar with Malick's work, you know what you're in for. Don't expect your typical drama and linear storyline. This is filmmaking at the highest level of ambition and sophistication. An arthouse picture reaching for the heavens. The movie is groundbreaking on every concievable level and one of the best films in the last decade. It is also the most beautiful movie I've ever seen.

The film itself cannot really be explained. Its essentially an episodic tale of one  family's highs and lows in 1950s Texas. Though what Malick does, and does incredibly well is explain how their story coinsides with the meaning of life and death and God. Malick asks the kinds of the questions that stump adults when kids ask them. Some may find it preachy and pretensious. Though a keen eye for art and an open ear for radical ideas and thoughts will send you soaring into amazement and into a state of film ecstacy. You may just be moved to tears by the images you see.

Walking out of this movie, I had a body high and heavy head like I've neever felt. I felt like I just sat through a 6 hour film, and I mean that in the best possible way.

 If you liked Days of Heaven, The New World, 2001: Spaced Odyessy and The Thin Red Line, you'll love this.",1314144000,9,1247,4.427947598253275

  Cannes has been awarding religious films in the past few years.... Couldn't humans live ""better"", after all, without the help of some external device they call God? The process of globalization, which causes the loss of local tradition everywhere, may be another driving force that works behind all this.
  My personal impression of this film is that it is a bold attempt to attribute to God everything from the creation of the universe to the birth of life, and the internal struggle of modern, industrialized people. It is a propaganda film, just like Schindler's List or Malcolm X. As a religious confession, it may indeed be truthful. However, in this film, nothing is to be seen beyond God. That is why the family reunion on the beach feels no less monotonous than Paradiso of Dante. Whether you like this film depends ultimately on whether you accept the unmistakably pre-modern values that you discern behind its graphic beauty and tactful direction.",1314144000,10,1135,4.98941798941799
4304138,5,B004A8ZX32,I can not say how much I loved this film.  It is a work of art.  It is near perfect in so many ways.,1313971200,2,100,3.125
4304139,5,B004A8ZX32,"Terrence Malick has filled his career with films that are simply gorgeous to look at but have been fairly light on actual plot.  Films like The Thin Red Line were great, but they were not everyone's cup of tea.  With 2011's The Tree of Life will not win over any mainstream praise, but it is however without a doubt the best film of Malick's entire career, and will easily come to be regarded as one of the greatest films in the history of cinema!

Perhaps Malick's most well-known work prior The Tree of Life for younger viewers is the masterfully well-executed WWII drama The Thin Red Line (1998).  For those who've seen The Thin Red Line you may have a general idea of how Malick likes to structure things.  That is, plenty of monologues delivered by his characters intercut with symbolic imagery of nature, and human interactions.  The big difference between The Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life however is the one most likely to frighten off the casual filmgoer: The Tree of Life doesn't in any way have what could be considered in any meaning of the term ""traditional narrative.""  In fact, the film has such little narrative its hard even applying the word to it.  Don't believe me?  Do dinosaurs appear in what you consider a ""traditional narrative""?  (Oh yeah: there's dinosaurs that pop up in this film and it is glorious).

What one must know going into The Tree of Life is that it is not a traditional drama starring Brad Pitt and Sean Penn.  The acting is good (especially Pitt) but the actors have little to nothing to do with the overall quality, or appeal of the film.  This is writer/director Terrence Malick's show.  This is a film of beauty and art.  One cannot view this film as a story, but as a work of art that one would find in a museum.

This film is not everyone's cup of tea, as I've tried to make abundantly clear in my review.  If you're someone who couldn't stand Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey you will most certainly not enjoy Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life.  Yes, there is a loose plot, just like2001: A Space Odyssey, but the plot is not the primary purpose of the film, which is to dig into the mysteries of life, and existence through the use of surrealist imagery and situations.  2001: A Space Odyssey had the side plot of HAL9000 and the crew of the Discovery.  The Tree of Life's plot within its imagery primarily focuses on the life of a 1950s family living in Waco, Texas (naturally reflecting Malick's actual childhood no doubt).  The acting in the 1950s portion is superb, and Brad Pitt gives a pitch perfect performance as the father.

I would like to tell you more about the plot, but there really isn't much to tell.  If you're honestly expecting to go and see a movie primarily focusing on the life of a Texas family during the 1950s all I can say is: you'll be confused, and sorely disappointed (just like those who honestly thought 2001: A Space Odyssey was just about a computer that goes rogue and starts killing the crew of a spaceship).  The only way to enjoy Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life is if you go in with an open mind, and have the understanding that you're not going to be watching a traditional drama- in fact, don't even go in thinking of this film as a drama.  You must look at this film as a piece of art, which it is.  I attended the film with a group of ten acquaintances who represented several age groups and ethnicities and we all loved this film.

The imagery is beautiful and if cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki doesn't see an Oscar nomination next year I'll consider it a crime against the industry!  I would like to see The Tree of Life be nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes and Academy Awards (especially with the category being expanded to ten nominees) but I doubt it would have any chance of actually winning because it goes so far against mainstream cinema.  It is a film for enthusiasts of cinema and for those who want the medium to transcend traditional narrative and become an art form all its own.  If you're part of the crowd that enjoys those kinds of movies you should not miss The Tree of Life if it comes through your town.

As a piece of art I feel Malick has created a film that will be remembered and studied by film critics and students for decades to come.",1313280000,3,4282,4.4652956298200515
4304140,5,B004A8ZX32,"I just saw this film yesterday and left the theater flying on a cloud of intense bliss.  This movie is a visual feast for the senses delivering millions of calories in pure delight and challenges us to interpret the story by perceiving the emotions from our individual perspectives - in many ways each reaction to this work is contingent on how we relate to the characters - the existential theme is universally understood.  Every viewer will insert their own life experiences to absorb what this epic means to them.  It's very much like a chemical reaction to our individual spiritual biology.

Every shot was perfectly choreographed by Malick's perfectionist eye.  Somewhere in the great beyond - Stanley Kubrick is smiling because another gifted director has grabbed the baton that he launched with his epic style of storytelling.  Malick is our modern day Michelangelo who has waited to make this masterpiece on HIS terms  and kept it on his drawing board for decades until he could execute it on his terms.  From my chair - I'd say he succeeded in building HIS Sistine Chapel ... a masterpiece for all time.  My only wish would be to see this on an IMAX screen.

4304141,4,B004A8ZX32,"I admit, after having watched - several times now- the beautifully made ""The Thin Red Line"" with it's contemplations on life in a war zone ( the Pacific during World War 2)  from the soldiers in battle perspective, I am somewhat biased towards the works of Terence Malick. Therefore, I did attend my first screening of this latest film of his here in Adelaide, South Australia, some weeks ago with high expectations. And I wasn't disappointed. That said, the languid atmosphere and long periods of seemingly boring family inactivity in this film, can understandably lead to frustration and disinterest. It is however, a beautifully made film which weaves those moments in life that many of us will experience in our families, with an ever present awareness of our impermanence yet connection with life. The  20 minute segment on the creation of the universe and life , which is reaffirmed throughout the film, is perhaps a tad too long and I agree that the dinosaur depiction was unnecessary. Considering the overall effect of the film they are however minor flaws. This is a moving film that will require some of us to revisit again - as I did.
At the end of the first viewing, which I attended alone, a lady in front of me turned to me and asked what the film was about. I tried to explain to her what I thought it was about, conceding that some may not quite appreciate the film - which was fine - but that I had really liked it. For the my second viewing my wife attended with me, and though not perhaps quite as perplexed as the lady from the first viewing, was underwhelmed. And that apparently is how it's been taken in most places. The actual film soundtrack is amazingly moving and fits the whole timbre of the film. However, I believe the so called film soundtrack on sale is NOT the actual music as used in the movie. I hope this is not correct, or that an actual soundtrack can be released. Don't go and see this movie if you are wanting to see a logical story unfold. ""The Tree Of Life"" is not that, it is more like moments in life captured in the frame of a memories. It is an ambitious but very worthy look at life.",1312243200,,2130,4.458974358974359
4304142,2,B004A8ZX32,"That's probably it for Malick and me. 'New World'  already had me sliding in my seat a third of the way in. 'The Tree of Life' had me squirming within forty minutes. I've stuck with him over the journey and regarded his first feature and 'Thin Red Line' with admiration. It seems that his obeisance to Tarkovsky has so overtaken him that he has little to say (though what his cinematic eye expresses in inarguably in the realm of the Sublime). The script aimed at the family drama and subsequent loss of the middle of three sons, is lame to say the least. It gives little room for the actors to move, though the elder pre-teenboy  exerts some screen presence. Little use was made of Sean Penn, as the architect this lad matures into. This brings into question why screen idols were even cast on the project as the leading males never break from their idol status. There's no maturation occuring from the glimpsed family dynamics. Especially absent is the void between the news of the death at the outset and its subsequent effect on the rest of the family. There's half an hour, it seems, of tedious national geographics and a ridiculous spurt of romping dinosaur graphics to evoke Malick's take on creation. Groan. Groan. There's such a disconnect between the sketchy 50s family stuff and the rhapsodic cinema the director gives us in his expression of Evolution which detracts from its lofty ambitions. The pretentious, whispered Big Question voice-overs were simplistic and sentimental. The unashamed Tarkovskian style and direct quoting got up my nose, particularly as they were left as undeveloped effects; the floating mum, her red-headedness, the Job quotation given at the beginning of the film(which smacked of the Russian's well-known fascination with Job); kids looking through rustling, lacey curtains, the over-long study up tree trunks, the dwelling on candles; the list goes on. Really. Michael Haneke has spoken of his own films being a riposte to cinema of this kind.'They are an appeal for a cinema of insistent questions instead of blase answers, for clarifying distance in place of violating closeness, for provocation and dialogue instead of consumption and concensus.' Malick, in all likelihood, would consider his work to fill his European counterpart's ambition. 'The Tree of Life' attests otherwise.

It finds reasons to be unhappy when all the world is shining around it. And love is smiling through all things,"" writer/director Terrence Malick.

The choice between nature and grace is a hard one for most people, but it's actually a struggle for the main character of ""The Tree of Life,"" Jack, who was raised by polar-opposite parents: a compassionate, free-spirited mother (the lovely Jessica Chastain), and a stern, disciplinarian father (played by Brad Pitt. Side note: the late Heath Ledger was originally casted for this role).

The adult Jack is an architect and seems trapped and suffocated (the perfect role for Sean Penn), not only by his current environment in a modern city of glass and metal, but by the unresolved issues with his brother's death as a teen and a complicated relationship with his father. And I'll even venture to say that he's also questioning his place in the universe, the meaning of it all.

Through Jack's fragmented memory we travel back in time (way back...like billions of years) to witness--with visual splendor--the birth of the cosmos and earth's formation (dinosaurs and all), before making a stop in the 1950's during his childhood in a small town in Texas.  The cinematography during this part of the film is much more subtle but equally splendid, with curtains swaying in the breeze, a shot of Jack during a lazy summer afternoon laying on a picnic blanket next to his mother, cheerful kids chasing after clouds of DDT smoke coming from a passing truck, the pleats of his mother's dress, the swing on the green front yard, the warmth of the light in their house...

You'll have to watch the film to continue that journey through time. But please understand that it's a different type of movie, which has won the praise of critics as well as the confusion of many viewers. Take a look at Yahoo Movies where critics rated it an A- while users gave it a C+. I've actually heard of people asking for their money back; and I can honestly see why.

Yet the stunning imagery, accompanied by an equally-impressive score, transcends your normal movie-going experience; some feel watching the film is more like a spiritual/religious experience of sorts for it reminds us of the miracle of life, nature, family ties, and our own existence.

4304146,4,B004A8ZX32,"An impressive effort in non-rational filmmaking, ""Tree of Life"" will hit you sideways in the theater but grow on you over time.
 Wanting to see a movie before the start of Judaism's Three Weeks of Affliction, I was drawn to the title - the Holy Torah (Jewish Bible) is called Etz Chaim (Tree of Life). Writer Terrence Malick hits a number of impressive Jewish notes including an opening quote from the Book of Job (38:4) and use of the song ""Ha Tikva."" If his purpose is to induce humility of soul through use of Job then Malick succeeded brilliantly with me. In 38:4, G-d speaks directly to Job for the first time out of the whirlwind with one of His penetrating questions. Remember that any time G-d asks a question it's not because He lacks knowledge (The Blessed One's rhetoric is eternally rhetorical).
 Malick's story then circles around this truth. He holds up the grandeur of G-d alongside the pettiness of human beings. Human shortcomings are best demonstrated by Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt) in his jealousy of others' material possessions and his compartmentalized religion including his inability to stay in the exaltedness of the classical music he enjoys and plays. O'Brien's militarist mindset is a pathetic attempt to get control of his surroundings and strike at what haunts him.
 Mrs. O'Brien outlines the spiritual tug of war in explaining the ways of grace and of nature. She probably elaborated on this in her prayers sprinkled through the film but they were whispered and my less-than-perfect hearing couldn't pick them up (my only complaint with the movie).
 The O'Brien household takes on an ""East of Eden"" feel although when we encounter Sean Penn's urban-locked character it's really the West (USA etc.) and its contrast to Eden that's being drawn for us. Like Adam and Eve, the O'Briens have three sons although ""Tree of Life"" eschews the brother-killing-brother theme. Penn's character ends up a city dweller/builder like Cain of the Book of Genesis. The O'Briens lose their home. The drive away from the family homestead conjures Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden. Recall that the Tree of Life was what became dangerous after Adam and Eve's sin with the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. A snake does not try to tempt Mrs. O'Brien (surely an oversight on Malick's part - joking).
 By covertly grasping for such grand themes, Malick likely sent some rationalists rushing to the box office to demand their money back. Instead, the rationalists should let their minds wander through Malick's gorgeous film and G-d's glorious garden tasting fruits that expand the senses of wonder and thankfulness.",1311206400,,2621,4.96127562642369

4304151,4,B004A8ZX32,"I empathize with the reviewer who was troubled by some negative reaction in the theater, especially from older folks (I'm 62, so am one). It was the same at my theater, again an art house place where people would expect something different. One old guy was yelling out in the parking for all the world to hear, ""This is the worst movie in the world."" He was so upset about it that I thought this film had actually struck an emotional chord in him, albeit a sour note. Perhaps being older and closer to a walk on that beach in the movie's final scenes was very disturbing to him and many folks over 60.

People have gone to this film expecting the normal arc of a ""movie,"" with a situation being set, characters rising to it or not, a crisis and finally a resolution. This film, thank goodness, has no such arc. Instead, it has a much broader perspective of a a much bigger and more important arc: life on earth and in the cosmos, as indicated by the title of the film. If you are not prepared for such an experience, or willing to consider it, then this movie only will frustrate you.

I thought I was ready for it, having seen all of Malick's earlier films and being somewhat in line with his world view, but even I was taken aback. I plan on seeing this again, but only at home on a Blu Ray DVD, where I can enjoy and contemplate the beauty and message of the film in peace and quiet. I've been reviewing his earlier films in preparation for that, notably Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line, and The New World. And there are numerous similarities and recurring themes (from different perspectives) from those to this new one. Truly, this is a body of work, or more to the point, a heart and soul of work.",1310688000,4,1705,4.291925465838509
4304152,4,B004A8ZX32,"I start this not knowing what I feel about Tree of Life. Such is the nature of the written word; something becomes of what is not there.

My first thoughts are given to the narrative style of the filmmaker. Or how the story is put together. Fascinating. And cinematic. Memories of 2001: A Space Odyssey. This is a truly cinematic film even with Malik's trademark hand-held camera technique which I found rewarding as it does fit the environment for the story. I went into FACT cinema Liverpool not knowing what the story would be but having recently viewed Thin Red Line on dvd was sufficiently impressed to wish to see his latest film.

Left the film feeling that bringing up kids means that two plus two does not always make four. It may be the basis for our education system but logic and parenting are not natural bedfellows. I also was reminded that before I was born women were treated as second class humans.

You do not have to like your kids in order to bring them up well. In the film parents trying to force the issue of loving are seen right through. In the audience at my afternoon viewing one elderly couple nearby were bemused by it all, I shan't say the basic questions they had, it would give the story away. I can understand their bewilderment. Where I was totally immersed in the filmmaker's visual flair and appreciated his grasp of infinity, others may dive in the popcorn.

Whilst I have mentioned how cinematic the film is I should also point out that the dvd will bring the best out of the gorgeous soundtrack. The sound of aloneness is the best I can do in respect of its description. Brahms and pipe organs are part of the story. Part of a character. Don't be put-off by the provisional artwork on the dvd cover: this is not a gooey movie.

Finally one can not comment on Tree of Life without mentioning a spiritual element. In my case I saw enough to just about believe that Malick left something for us who lean toward the idea of a complex, inventive reality which is persistently happening throughout the universe and the one next door.

I knew I'd get somewhere. Hope you do too.",1310601600,3,2110,4.496083550913838

As a mother who lost her son only a year ago, I was immediately drawn into the family, the dynamics, and the questions to the universe and to the one who is lost. I'm still processing this movie. The beauty of the universe displayed and the music accompanyment left me breathless. The searching thoughts and questions presented in the movie, I have also asked to the nightsky, to the universe, to anyone who might listen. Our lives unfold and no one is untouched by sorrows.

4304154,1,B004A8ZX32,"The new Malick film - in production for several years, leaving Malick fans desparate for information for just as long - finally gets its release, six years after The New World. Allegedly working from a script that Malick first drew up a few decades ago (originally titled Q) it sounded very grand altogether, the most ambitious and explicitly existential of anything he's done so far. I think many waited in delight and confidence that Malick could pull off another cinematic masterpiece, maybe even his ultimate project. For a film maker who'd only made four features before this he had garnered a huge amount of critical and cult acclaim, not unwarranted. Days of Heaven is a cinematic masterstroke, a film so exquisite the plot is largely irrelevant. On the strength of his previous work I never feared that The Tree of Life could be a disaster. When it was subject to a hugely polarized reception at Cannes it was an indication that maybe not all was well; the films fans seemed to say nothing of import (either Malick sycophants or the waffly, pretentious bunch) and its detractors were fairly consistent in why they disliked it. That was a bad sign. The Tree of Life is a ridiculous splatter of simplistic and poorly executed drama. A painfully overreaching and shockingly unsatisfactory debacle.

It's such a shame. The film manages to feature some majestic images - some of the space imagery and much of the 1950s Americana environment - but in trying to tie them together the films often visual beauty gets subsumed with a boring, self indulgent flop-around in sentimentality. What is most surprising about the failure of this film is that the editing is incredibly amateurish. Even for the films topic it is far too long and repetitive, but also it cuts-to-black on so many shots, which has a very jarring effect. I can only assume this was a conscious decision (a planned editing style) but it is totally wrong. Why Malick didn't realise this and take the whole film and spend more time editing it in a different way is beyond me. There is a bizarre amount of very brief scenes that seem to be just thrown in for the sake of it, as if the editor didn't want to spare them because they looked nice. The film's original score is unremarkable, but some of the other music featured is pleasant, like Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No. 3 II lento. The actors for the most part do a good job, except Pitt is fairly wooden and Penn probably shouldn't have bothered turning up, an unflattering gig for him. Chastain is lovely but has very little to do except look graceful and stay mute. The voice overs are stupid. McCracken is a good young actor and someone who probably has a decent future ahead of him. And the in-your-face Christian magniloquence? Uncomfortable to say the least.

Now this is saying a lot. The best part of the film is a brief line near the start. The mother is being consoled by an undoubtedly Irish neighbour over the loss of one of her three sons; the neighbour is confirming to the mother that life goes on and says ""Sure ya still have the other two"". I had a great laugh, unlike the other cinema attendees. That's all I got from The Tree of Life in the end. Malick aimed very high, obviously even too high for him. A monumental let down. But I don't fear for Malick's future; if he takes on more subtle projects he can recapture his magic. He may do that with his next film, he may not. Regardless The Tree of Life is a waste of time.",1310342400,32,3459,4.5954692556634305
4304155,5,B004A8ZX32,"""Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth? When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?""

This verse of Scripture from the book of Job opens Terrence Malick's latest masterpiece, entitled The Tree of Life. After these words appear over a black screen and fade out into the darkness, a mysterious flame illuminates the center of the screen, followed by a distant voice which breaks the silence - ""Brother. Mother. It was they who led me to Your door.""

Thus begins the most beautiful and complex film that you are likely to see this decade. It is not a film in the traditional sense of the word. This is not a plot-driven film. What we have here is the journey of life in words and images - a prayer to God which questions His motives, which longs to understand Him, which calls upon Him, and yearns to be near Him at all times.

The film follows Jack O'Brien (Sean Penn) on the anniversary of his younger brother's death. Jack, a skilled architect, is disillusioned with the world around him. ""The world has gone to the dogs"", Jack ponders, as he stares blankly out of the window of a high-rise building. Jack leaves his office and prays to God - ""When did you first touch my heart?"" Almost immediately, we are whisked back and forth, through past, present, and beyond, to the creation of the galaxies and the Earth, to the brief reign of the dinosaurs and the beginning of human existence, until, finally, we reach ""the end of time"".

Throughout the film, we revisit Jack's tormented childhood in rural Texas in the 1950s. We are introduced to his family, led by his parents (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain). His angelic mother teaches Jack and his two brothers the ways of grace (love, forgiveness), while his father represents the way of nature (selfishness, greed). These conflicting worldviews serve as a catalyst for Jack's spiritual and existential struggle, which drives the second act of the film.

Mind you, this synopsis does the film no justice. This film cannot be defined in simplistic terms, nor can it be categorized into any specific genre. This is a film that defies convention. It redefines the way that we experience cinema. It is alive, full of wonder and awe. It is poetry. As a friend of mine said after the first screening, this film is a force. It will be a different experience for each individual. You will get out of this film exactly what you bring to it. For me, it is quite possibly the most spiritually significant experience that I have ever had in a theatre. It allowed me to see God portrayed in a way that is respectful, unique and all-encompassing. The grace and mercy of God saturates every frame of this film. Every element - from the beautiful and haunting imagery, to the ethereal soundtrack, to the understated performances, to the philosophical musings on faith and existence - comes together in perfect harmony to create an unforgettable work of art. The performances are uniformly excellent, and the direction from Terrence Malick is as perfect as ever. Not since Kubrick has an artist tackled these complicated themes with such respect and originality.

This is the best film that I have ever seen.

He's not philosophizing with the viewer, he's not educating the audience scientifically or spiritually. He is engaging in discussion. He is sharing the most intimate moments and thoughts of his upbringing. He is confessing his current dilemma.

There probably are two ways to appreciate this film. The first is to relate to the humanity in it. The second is to realize that it's a self-portrait.

Renoir, Kirchner, Dali and others painted silent pictures. In his motion-painting, Malick includes inspiring musical scores at half the price of a day long museum pass.",1310169600,4,735,5.264957264957265
4304185,5,B004A8ZX32,">(there are some spoilers in my review)<

We humans are very sensitive even if our lives are suffused with far too much data, noise and stuff. Sometimes we just yearn towards environments within reach that restore our sense of inner calm, even if we know it will only be a brief respite.  In that space we create for ourselves, many times we find ourselves taking stock.  One of the themes in this film are the moments when we reflect and try to bring order and sense to the fragmented histories that we live through.  Terrance Malick is by nature a contemplative man who has looked down into the philosophical well.  He uses movies as his canvas much as other artists like Beethoven or Michelangelo use their mediums to express their ideas, feelings and testaments.  Malick has completed so few films that to examine the amount of words that each one generates it all adds up to a disproportionate amount of discharge.  He makes big films that expand the mind, stretch the senses and challenge our preconceptions.

""The Tree of Life"" could be seen as a 3'rd instalment of a triptych or perhaps the last instalment in a trilogy that began several years ago with the richly rewarded ""The Thin Line"" followed closely by the very moving ""The New World"".  There are so many connective themes appearing in the three films that one can draw the conclusion that these are more than mere Malickisms and that they are more than just hallmarks of his stylistic prowess.  A composer uses the same notes just like a painter uses the same colors; what is unique is the novel arrangements of those notes and colors, shaped into fresh ideas each time.  The scenes of swaying tall grasses, camera shots pointed straight up into stands of very tall trees, hands touching blades of grass, the sounds of crickets, running, rushing or blasting water all permeate these films.  The sounds and images of young children, symbolizing life at the outset, not yet sullied and tarnished are all here.  The lack of dialogue, long a Malick standard that thumbs its nose at overly wordy mainstream films is used in all three films to great theatrical effect.  I have always maintained that the most powerful moments in cinematic history are those emoted by the eyes and mouth of an actor and not by the actual dialogue which is more often than not just pompous self conscious signs pointing to meaning.  Humans long ago learned to read faces before language evolved and it remains our most primal means of communication.  Why, therefore, Malick receives so much criticism for how little is spoken in his films says much more about how unaccommodating and impatient we are with non-formulaic motion pictures; it says a lot about how we have forgotten that in silence so much can be said.  I enjoy being reminded of this by his art and ethos.  It continues to amaze me that recent commentary about this film includes such accusations as ""pretentious"", ""ponderous"", ""boring"", etc.  This is such a reflection of the madness of our times where everything is expected to be formula driven, patterned on many generations of people who grew up watching sit-coms and dramas on television, with their shallow and empty `entertainment' completely fabricated in the mould of screen time versus advertisement time.  Critics simply don't know how to look, see, hear and drink in images without recourse to the expected, the special effects, and the gratuitous use of nudity or sexual innuendo, satisfying needs for titillation.  These same people would walk into an art gallery and sneer, ""what a waste of time this is"" and ""what the hell is that supposed to mean?""  Ok, enough lamenting.

The film is a bit too long but this is just my first impression.  Like his earlier films in the apparent trilogy we hear hushed, whispered and softly spoken dialogue that is a palpable layer on top of the visual images, often sounding like prayers.  This is a Malick touch and few directors use this mannerism as well or as often.  Unlike the sound editing of the voice-overs in ""The New World"", which suffered from too quiet levels, the voice-overs here are clearly audible.  The film has five editors, which is amazing enough but perhaps as in his other films, there was so much film shot that had to be cut and put together.  Once again his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki is the star of the show.  There are some shots that are so awesome that one wonders if they are all natural versus CGI compositions. They hint at mystery, point at the infinite within the contours of finite spaces.  Malick has directed Lubezki to shoot many scenes where there is constant motion, strongly suggestive of agitation.  And always the rush of water, the sweep of wind through grass and trees, the sounds of animals and crickets, the softening colors of sunsets, the shock of sudden noises.

The central powerhouse that generates the endless tension that coils and winds up all the action radiates from the character played with great skill by Brad Pitt.  His character is driven, disappointed by how his desires always eluded him, a tough ex-Navy man who is going to show his sons how to be a man, even if it means that he sometimes acts callow, heartless and insensitive to his family.  It matters little really that the time period of the drama takes place in the late 50's or that it is a middle class family in Texas, because the same family dynamics could take place now, even though our modern big city landscapes are imbued with different languages, cultures and values.

One of the big ideas that Malick presents is the notion that life gives you two choices for the way you live: that of nature or of grace.  Nature implies the impersonal and often brute way that animals act, more often than not the survival mode drawing power from deep survival roots, hardwired into the reptilian part of our brains.  The implication of grace is the softening values inherent in most mainstream religions.  We are talking about forgiveness, giving love and extending understanding and this is echoed in Christian and Jewish traditions.  Malick is not making a judgement but we feel the presence of the boundary between the two values and there is little we can do but squirm if we are not sure how we stand.

Another theme examines the tensions that simmer between fathers and sons as they both grow older.  The son naturally pushes back at the ever tightening grip of his father as he looks to assert his own will, find his voice and grow in self realization.  All of this is portrayed against a family background of pain and marital conflict.  The eldest son finds himself unconsciously acting out hurtful behaviour towards his own brothers and is shocked by his own acts.  This is then greatly amplified when we discover that one of the brothers dies a mysterious, unnamed death; his reaction to this is to carry a heavy guilty weight which he is unable to shake loose.  In some ways the family dynamics are very typical of many families in almost any era.  However, the film elevates the drama to high levels where we view almost dreamlike states, listening in on inner conversations of the characters.  I am not certain why he wrote the script with so much unresolved angst at the core of the family unit.  I would have to see this again a few more times and try to come up with answers to the questions it raises.

The film goes in and out of time lines that all reference what the tree of life represents.  Of course, the tree of life is first and foremost a Biblical reference to the Garden of Eden, to a state of perfection, innocence and the beginnings of human life.  God gave instructions to his first two humans to notice two trees growing in the garden; the tree of life (allowed) and the tree of knowledge (forbidden and restricted).  In Malick's film the tree of life is the central motif, with strong allusions to evolution of life on the planet. Where is the tree of knowledge then?  In the Bible the eating of the fruit of knowledge is the very act that destroys the pure relationship between humans and their Creator.  Are the characters in this film damaged by knowledge?  One could argue that the death in the family might have been the price they paid for knowledge, perhaps the children's knowledge of how very unhappy their parents marriage was, how unhappy their father was is a type of knowledge that burns and leaves a scar.  It is an obscure theme and I would need to see the film a few more times before I was sure.

Contemplation is front and center in the film.  Malick, as the Creator of the film, adopts the position of the heights, looking back on how it all came to be and looking far into the future, how it will all end.  These swirling images of planets, stars, suns, galaxies enter and exit the film several times, reminding me now of the role that the black metallic slab played in Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  Malick poses questions but I am not sure if he also has presented his answers.  If nature is inherently brutal, clumsy, amoral and this is the way that life evolved, where is the room for the state of grace that is offered as a counterbalance to nature's way?  Is grace a man-made way of living, created out of painful reaction against the rawness of nature's way?  The film is littered with several philosophical questions and it does not end with a clear resolution.  Some of the ambiguity is dealt with in an interesting dream sequence, which I suppose you could see as a life after death scenario where we all get to unite with loved ones from a past life. The child that dies we are not told how or why he died and it is only subtly hinted as to which child it was in this dream sequence.  The mother's voice offering up her son to the sky, to God, is strongly reminiscent of the many scenes in ""The New World"" where Pocahontas offers her prayers to the spirits with her hands held up and open towards the sky.

In the three films that I refer to, there is a price paid by some major character for seeking and finding grace or for letting it go.  I am not certain that Malick is stating that this is inevitable but it is strongly suggestive.  There is so much going on in this film that I will need a few more viewings to clarify my own thoughts.  It is truly the largest scale film he has ever made. Its overall obscurity and dreamlike state leaves the doors open to so many interpretations and I am not clear that this was intentional.  Deep, provocative, emotionally stirring and challenging, this will not be widely received and appreciated by patrons looking for formulaic and predictable entertainment.  This opus demands multiple viewings and quiet consideration.",1309996800,2,10665,4.65368196371398

In the National Catholic Register (6/10/11), Steven Greydanus rhetorically asked: ""Is Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life a pretentious mess or a profound masterpiece?""

Greydanus is absolutely correct in saying that this ""is a film that not only asks, with unusual insistence, why God allows suffering, but contemplates God's own answer to that question in the Book of Job, amplified by the sweeping vistas of the natural world available to modern science, the Hubble telescope and Hollywood special effects: God did all this; who are we to think we can judge or question him?""

This movie makes you appreciate everything a lot more without being a drama. It's not a hippy festival nor is it a mental home. For those of you who have something, which is called a soul (though it might not exist and this statement is worth less than void), you can let it free to dangle wherever it wants. You might visit your childhood, your current life and an uncertain future. This uncertain future however is not seen as something stressful but rather like a delicate dandelion in the summer wind and when related to the universe it becomes meaningless. The movie is not about religions, but about what mankind is capable of in it's peak moments: see the beauty and feel it!",1309737600,3,800,4.601398601398602
4304190,4,B004A8ZX32,"As I sat through this film, I felt that there were moments of unparalleled, shimmering beauty surrounded by a film that was way too pretentious.

There's hardly any dialogue,
no sense of narraration or story,
the Sean Penn chacter is baffling and useless,
the ending really had no climax,
the relationship between Brad Pitt (father) and Jessica Chastain (mother) is minimized,
The creation of the universe/dinosaur montage made no sense and
there were too many Discovery Channel/nature montages.

Walking out of the theater, I had negative feelings about the film.

However, I thought about this film that evening and the next day. It made me reminisce about my childhood and upbringing. Although the film takes place in Waco, Texas, it could have been anytown America, circa 1955-1975...my era. I grew up in the 60's and 70's and this film did strike a very emotional chord with me. It reminded me of my childhood, in a manner, that no other film has come close to. It captured moments of;

The elation and jealousy of getting a baby sibling;

The mischievous playing with matches and the adventure of first encountering firecrackers;

The excitement of going into a downtown area/business district (before the era of strip shopping malls and convenience stores);

The innocent strange and creepy sensation of first encountering a handicap person;

The excitement of playing in a suburban neighborhood and running through the yards;

The sheer joy of swimming or running through sprinklers on a hot day;

The special bond formed between brothers of a close age;

This film brilliantly made cinematic ""rites of passage"" that are a common denominator among us baby boomers (It would be hard for a person that grew up in an urban environment or generation X and Y to empathize with this).

I honestly do not know, exactly, what this film was about. Brad Pitt was excellent as an Eisenhower-era suburban Dad. In today's eyes, he would be viewed as too stern and abusive however, he was dead on accurate as to how a man thought he was supposed to act during that era. As realistic as Pitt's character was, Jessica Chastain was the opposite since her character was played as a mythical beauty, a representative of pure grace. In the beginning of the movie, they learn that their 19 year old was killed (presumably ...in Vietnam?) and the rest of the movie goes back to when everybody was young and the movie simply ponders ...LIFE.

This is not an easy movie to absorb. While many parts were brutally ponderous (the creation of the universe sequence lasts... like... 20 minutes, creating a very unneccessary break in the drama) most of the scenes, even if they did not work, were nontheless captivating.

In hindsight, this movie is very daring because it has sequences of absolute, unequaled beauty and tenderness yet the film never feels that it has to explain itself or any aspect of what is going on. This is an unapologetic ""take it or leave it"" piece of art that is simply on celluloid.

I changed my feeling about this movie because it stuck with me in a manner that no other film has done...and therefore, it achieved it's job. This is flawed yet director Terrance Malick's flaws are incompareable to the play it safe films that make the rounds. This film can only be appreciated by a parton that views movies as an ""art form"".

NOTE, this film is compared to ""2001, a Space Odyssey"" but this is nothing like that, Kubrick's movie is much more cohesive with the ""Star Child"" ending being very pragmatic compared to lack of struture in this film. I compare this film to movies that capture innocent nostalgia, the very under-appreciated kids/baseball movie ""The Sandlot"" or ""Stand by Me"" coming to mind.",1309305600,3,3705,4.8386075949367084
4304191,5,B004A8ZX32,"I saw ""The Tree of Life"" yesterday, and I'm still reflecting on it today. Let me say right away that some of the audience hated it, complaining it was the worst film they'd ever seen, obviously not what they'd been expecting in the least. I can understand that reaction, just as I can understand the chasm between positive & negative reviewers -- this is NOT a summer blockbuster by any stretch of the imagination!

That said, let me explain some of the reasons I found it so deeply moving & soul-nourishing ...

First of all, it's a gorgeous & sumptuous film. The images aren't just vivid & lyrical, they flow into one another with a quiet, subtle rhythm that mesmerizes & enthralls. It invites to viewer to actually stop & look at the tiniest, most seemingly insignificant details of the everyday world & see how utterly wondrous they truly are. It's a reminder that beneath the familiar, ever-shifting screen of what we call everyday life, something that's increasingly more artificial & superficial, there's still a very real universe, something that preceded humanity & will long outlast it. This is an uncomfortable reminder for many, but it offers a necessary perspective for anyone aspiring to more than simply buying things & going from sensation to sensation.

Then there's the astonishing evocation of childhood in all of its mystery & confusion & occasional terror. I found myself reliving a flood of my own childhood memories, sparked by what I saw on the screen. In particular, the father-son dynamic had me remembering my own late father & our relationship; this was both wrenching & healing. For those who have lost family & then come to certain wiser realizations later on, when it's too late to voice them, I think this aspect of the film will really resonate.

And of course there's the philosophical & metaphysical aspect. We've all pondered & asked the questions raised in this film at one time or another, haven't we? We all want understandable answers to our unanswerable questions. Many prefer to bury those questions & get on with everyday life ... and I won't necessarily condemn them. But sooner or later, whether we like it or not, we've got to confront those questions & grapple with them. Better to do so of our own volition, rather than being forced into it by trauma & loss. Again, I found that the film invites us to do just that. It's not a coincidence that Sean Penn's Jack does this at midlife, when he's gained everything he could want materially, but lacks the peace & resolution he so obviously & desperately seeks.

Like a few other films -- ""2001,"" ""Baraka,"" ""The Fountain"" all come to mind -- this is more of a tone poem, a symphony to be experienced & then thought about afterwards, than a traditional narrative. I think it's best seen in a thoughtful, reflective frame of mind, as if entering a cathedral or a museum, rather than as an evening's entertainment. Whatever quibbles I might have about this or that detail, they fade in the face of the film's overall achievement.

Still, as I said at the beginning, it's not for everyone's taste. Read the reviews & decide for yourself it's the sort of thing you might find intriguing. If so, you're in for a remarkable film, one that will stay with you for a long time -- highly recommended!",1309305600,8,3282,4.729020979020979
4304192,5,B004A8ZX32,"Tree of Life was everything I needed it to be.

In terms of aesthetics, it was certainly a flawed film - the evolution sequence could have been edited down, certain lines of the script could be construed as cliche or pretentious - however, I think this film will be seen as one of the great masterpieces of our time.

In the opening section of Andrei Tarkovsky's book, SCULPTING IN TIME, he discusses the audience reaction of his fellow Russians to his serpentine, narrative-less film, Mirror.  Although many were confounded, he mentions that a significant number of people had sent him letters thanking him for making the film, and that they required no logical explanation about the events in the film for, as they told him, they ""had lived it.""  I believe that if we approach it with open minds and hearts, without any reservations about the unique language of Malick's storytelling, Tree of Life will have the same impact on 21st Century Americans that Tarkovsky's Mirror had on Russians in the 1970s.  In both the most cosmic and the most intimately personal ways possible, Tree of Life represents the unfolding of our very lives before our eyes.

It's no coincidence that Malick portrays the morose, disturbed Sean Penn character as a vaguely corrupt, high-profile corporate businessman with childhood roots (quite literally, given all the shots of foliage) in the late 50's and early 60's, America's most naive epoch.  He's allowing the intricate mysticism of his film to act as a catharsis and rebirth for contemporary viewers who feel that our condition amidst this world economic crisis is one which was doomed from the start; one doomed by the sins, failures, and greed of generations past, and that we're left with no power to prevent that history from penetrating and governing our will to forge ourselves a better future.

But he does so not only by way of a traditional storyline in which some of the main characters evolve through personal experience and reflection, but also by tracing back our existence to the very beginnings of the earth (a la 2001: A Space Odyssey), as well as attempting a conjecture on where we might be headed.  Thus, the logic of the film demonstrates, as primordially as possible, that while no one moment in the history of time carries more value or meaning than another, they all add up to something more valuable and meaningful than any one of us could possibly imagine.  In this way, Tree of Life acknowledges and accepts the fundamental tenents of nihilism and postmodernism, all while turning them on their head and daring the audience to submit to some vague metaphysical CHANCE which may ultimately lead us to the very essence of value and meaning.

The fact that Terrence Malick has one of the most visually stunning directing styles of anyone in the history of cinema certainly aids us in our acceptance of the vast risks this film takes.  One of the most jarring shots in the film for me was the image of the mother carrying one of her sons away from a seizure victim writhing in the middle of the road, concerned about the developmental effect that witnessing such an event might have on her child.  We never learn who the seizure victim was, why he was in that state, or what significance he played in any of their lives, and the shot only lasts a few seconds in a long sequence of equally-paced shots - the event never returned to again.  We only know that this brief instant had enough bearing on the characters' lives to be shown in the film, and this is all we need to know to accept it and treat it no differently from any other moment.  In Malick's universe, where every branch in the ""tree of life"" is equally valuable or valueless, we learn that we must treat all of them as precious, striving to fill them with love, kindness, acceptance, forgiveness, and understanding, for all life forms and for all eras of our lives - past, present, and future.

If you allow yourself to accept the complexities of its style and the jarring, seemingly contradictory elements of its story, you won't be bothered by what you may perceive as weaknesses in the script, the editing, the performances or perhaps even the directing - you will simply allow Tree of Life into the core of your being, and it may well turn out to be everything you need it to be.  It was for me.

Go see this film.",1309305600,8,4338,4.685526315789474
4304193,5,B004A8ZX32,"I went to an evening performance of this film.  As I waited in line, the 4 pm movie let out. I was greeted with seniors raging about how awful the film was, save your money and go home they shouted at us, waiting in line to go in. I had never experienced this before.  The film was being shown in a suburban 'art house' where the films off the beaten path are shown.
I was hooked from the beginning. The only problem with this film was the people in the movie house who didn't get it and were noisily leaving. One person tentatively shushed a noisy woman exiting "" what shushed?! there's no dialogue!""
I thought, at last, not the same old human condition story where I am desperate for some crumb of light, something to enlighten, to illuminate.  I loved it! the music, the photography!  I remember that barely contained young boy energy!  A group of older boys in our neighborhood used to walk up the hill in front of our house and their pubescent energy was loud, dangerous, wild - cutting through the rhythms of a summer day.  At the end, the audience, of which there were many, applauded.

8419790,5,B004A8ZX32,"If there is one thing that's been true about movies in America, and American movie goers film watching habits for many a year now is this: Americans love crap. Entertainment-wise that is. We can never get enough of super hero movies, lame chick flicks, cliche-ridden horror movies, prequels, sequels, remakes, reboots, etc. We almost tend to run screaming from anything aspiring to ""art"" in film today. We also tend to act very angrily towards it. This is, I think, part of what makes us essentially American. The fast food, junk food approach to movies and other entertainment. What could be more American than that? So, unfortunately, a movie like Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life from 2010 would have no place in our modern movie world. Hell, even Brad Pitt couldn't save it for us. But maybe that's the point. This is a film that at times seems like it came from another time, and another world. One where all of the rules of the summer blockbuster and the indie sleeper hit are thrown out the window. One where you have to go on instinct as a film goer. One where you either take it or leave it as is. The film plays by it's own rules.
  First of all, Sean Penn plays an architect of some renown, who still has issues with his dad after all these years. We then go back to the past, namely 1950's Waco, Texas. Brad Pitt is the dad, and he is strict and hard edged. He loves his three sons (Sean Penn is supposed to be the oldest) but is a stern taskmaster who reaps what he does not sow. Jessica Chastain is his sweet-natured wife, and also a loving mother who tends to put up in silence with her husband's strictness. The oldest son seethes with resentment at his father, and this drives much of the film. He plays with his little brother and their friends, in scenes which reminded me a bit of Stand By Me. All that childhood innocence and stuff. He also learns some important life lessons along the way.
  Second of all, the film kicks off into 2001: A Space Odyssey-like scenes which depict the birth of the cosmos, the beginning of life on earth, and the extinction of the dinosaurs. Although visually stunning, with some of the same visual effects used in 2001, it's hard to find just what is the connecting tissue between these scenes and the 1950's Waco scenes. But we haven't seen a film in ages that looks quite like this one. All of Malick's films have that deep brooding poetry of luscious visuals that often make the story and people in it seem non-existent. But this one tops them all, I believe. This movie is sometimes just too much. And maybe, on some wavelength we don't understand yet, it's just enough.
  Also, I personally liked the use of classical music in this film. This is something that can often be applied wrongly or badly in a film, and often for satirical effect. But Malick seems like he carefully chose the pieces which pop up in this film, something which reminds me of my personal favorite director, Stanley Kubrick. I'm 50 percent on the film's side just for that. I especially liked the use of Smetana's The Moldau in a scene which shows the kids playing. This scenario just should not work on paper. But when you put it up there on the big screen, it works beautifully. And I found the use of excerpts from the Berlioz Requiem to be inspired, especially when everyone meets on the shores of that sweet by and by. I don't think I could ever listen to that music again without thinking of this film. For me, that's a monumental success.
  To call this film ""arty"" is about as redundant as calling the sun hot. This film is so ""arty"" it makes Ingmar Bergman look like Judd Apatow. Not an easy thing to do. But a great movie is a great movie, regardless of whether it is ""highbrow"" or ""lowbrow"". This film has to be accepted and taken for what it is. Once done, the more ""open-minded"" movie viewers out there can take it in and appreciate it, and maybe even like it. I know you're out there somewhere! However, I don't think this film's esteem is going to grow or shrink in the next couple of decades. It will remain the same. And people will either respond rapturously to it, or long for the next Avengers movie. So be it. As long as we have Terrence Malick, or whoever the next generation inspired by him is, making films even close to this, we have hope. That's the other 50 percent.----------PEACE",1525996800,,4342,4.466582597730139
