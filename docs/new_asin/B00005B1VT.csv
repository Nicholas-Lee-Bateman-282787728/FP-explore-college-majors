1420559,5,B00005B1VT,"Daniel Auteuil portrays a private detective who at first seems sleazy, but redeems himself when he takes on what appears to be a simple missing persons case, which takes some very sinister turns, and which costs him dearly. It poses the proposition that sometimes a seemingly unworthy person only needs the opportunity to do the right thing. It might also leave you wondering which shades of grey are whiter. Taut and dry.",1354492800,,422,4.875
1420560,4,B00005B1VT,"Good film, a little hard to follow at times due to the actor's French accent, but some great twists and turns.  Sad to think though about the reality of the child sex trade, esp. in the West.",1306195200,,191,4.162162162162162
1420561,2,B00005B1VT,"With such a cast, all that was needed was a few good plot twists. But no. Neither the writers (Eric and Margaret Leclere) nor the director (Chris Menges) has the faintest idea of how to create convincing tensions and conflicts. The scenes between M. Auteuil and Mlles Kinski and Denicourt all fall flat: they clearly have no idea of what's going on, and neither do we. The disappearance of a son leads to kiddie prostitution and snuff, but what does this have to do with a junkie from a good family? I couldn't watch the whole thing.",1229558400,2,533,4.505154639175258
1420562,4,B00005B1VT,"This is a hard look at the evils of the child trade. A private investigator, who makes much of his money black mailing wealthy cheating spouses, gets a case involving a missing child.  He then stumbles into the high stakes world of buying and selling children.  High suspense. This film was a wake up call to what goes on in the world.

1420563,5,B00005B1VT,"Daniel Auteuil continues to impress me as one of today's finest actors -- in any language.  This is a well-done thriller with an outstanding supporting cast, but it is Auteuil's film -- and he is -- well, merveilleux!  Don't miss this one.",1156464000,,239,4.666666666666667
1420564,4,B00005B1VT,"This is a taut & suspenseful thriller/mystery from Europe that, while not breaking any new ground, offers enough odd touches and twists to make it one of the better entries in the genre. Set in London, the film stars Daniel Auteuil, the wonderfully versatile French actor in an English-speaking part, as a private detective with a past. Auteuil is gifted, and he makes you accept him as this troubled and haunted ex-policeman, with nicely shaded touches. He is complimented with an excellent supporting cast that includes Nastassia Kinski and other English & French veterans.
The film has a sad and horrific story centering it's plot, (a story all too true, unfortunately), and moves along at a nice pace. It held my interest all the way.
The violence in the film is dealt with brutally but with tactful swiftness, not dwelt on or exaggerated. The direction is by Chris Menges, the award-winning cinematographer, and he does a good crisp job here. Well produced, and well worth your time if you like the genre.",1044662400,18,1010,4.877906976744186
1420565,3,B00005B1VT,"The movie is a hard subject to digest, but it does exist and I give credit to the writer and whoever else was responsible for this movie to be made. The children are raised in Mexico until they are ready to be moved to larger cities and used as sex slaves. They are ignorant to what is going to happen to them in the near future. The movie is really not exploitative in showing the topic, it doesn't try to pull on our heartstrings by using emotional scenarios, it just shows it like it is, that is the really good thing about the movie. The rest of it is very predictable and fits the standard formula for all the substandard suspense films. That is why I rated it less than 4 stars. I wish there go have been something that ran against the grain aside from the topic, which is rarely shown in any movies, or even more rarely talked about. Daniel Auteuil is good in this
movie, and it was really neat to see him talk in English. I have always been a big fan of his. His acting is always superb! The movie was definately film noir, dark and mysterious, its just that the mystery wasn't hard to get and there weren't any parts that really grabbed your attention and held it, so 3 stars, for the subject matter and Auteuil....",1016841600,4,1224,4.257510729613734
1420566,5,B00005B1VT,"One of the best international thrillers in the last ten years. Daniel Auteuil plays a French private investigator, now living in London because of a tragedy that killed his wife and daughter in Paris. He is summoned by a friend he knew in Paris, also now in London, who tells Auteuil's character that he has a job for him, which is to locate his wife's brother. The brother--the lost son of the title--is known for his drug excesses, and so it is not surprising that he would be missing.
What is surprising is the chain of events that follows, taking Auteuil's character from London to Mexico and back, involving a prostitute, horrific child abuse, and corruption among the wealthy.

Auteuil does a fine job as the P.I., Billie Whitelaw--one of my favorite British actresses--is suitably hard-edged in the role of the family matriarch, and Bruce Greenwood is credibly sleazy as the dealer in unspeakable practices.  The investigator makes moral choices throughout the entire film that are so dead on target that every act of violence contributes to the power of this film. This is a terrific film and absolutely worth owning. I am proud to have this in my DVD collection.",999043200,29,1171,4.82089552238806

7936473,2,B00005B1VT,"I like Daniel Auteuil a lot and his charming presence led me into a world that I wasn't sure I wanted to enter...the underside of London and the child pornography industry.  His friend, a beautiful prostitute, has the contacts he needs to find a missing person for his clients and in his effort to find the fellow he stumbles into the horrific world of child pornography.  Because the film was skillfully made and the acting good I kept watching.  But at the point where the detective has to look at photos of tiny, small, boys who are the tricks of the trade, I had to shut off the film.  It wasn't worth putting this through my brain.  I know this stuff exists and I would do anything in my power to put a stop to it.  But watching this film isn't going to do it and I chose not to go any further.

This isn't saying this is a bad film and it is definitely on the right side of the issue.  It is only to warn prospective viewers, which is the purpose of this site, that this is hard to watch.",1359331200,2,994,4.140625
