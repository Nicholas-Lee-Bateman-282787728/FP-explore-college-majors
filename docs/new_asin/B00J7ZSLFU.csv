8648668,5,B00J7ZSLFU,"I loved this series and highly recommend it! It's very accessible even if you haven't watched much Asian drama before - like a cross between America's Northern Exposure and Britain's Doc Martin, with a bit of Scottish Local Hero thrown in with the seafaring musical score. The cast is perfect and funny, and the plots of each episode feature laugh-out-loud comedy as well as realistic medical teamwork. The scenery is truly beautiful, and the ""real"" romance between Mako and Dr. Kota is sweet with a happy ending at Christmas (very important in Asian drama). Matsuda Shota really shines as the doctor - some may remember him from the Japanese version of ""Boys Over Flowers"" called ""Hana Yori Dango,"" and which didn't showcase his talent as well as this series. For anyone familiar with J-drama or manga, you will enjoy the funny winks at ""Mischievous Kiss: Love in Tokyo"" and all the many versions of that story from Korea to Taiwan, including giving the ""second button"" instead of a ring, the fact that Mako looks like Kotoko and saves up silly mementos of the doctor, and the fact that Dr. Kota thinks he has to marry everyone else except the obvious choice. The obsession with pudding / flan is right out of the Netflix Japanese manga series ""Good Morning Call,"" in which a teenage couple bonds over their love for milk pudding - another cute series I recommend as well.",1473206400,,1373,4.7489539748953975
8648669,4,B00J7ZSLFU,"I think you'll either love or hate this show.  Every character is eccentric and you'll either take to them or you won't.  I took to them.  There's great chemistry between all of them.  The settings are great; each episode takes you to a different island.  But, if you're a dramatic purist, who demands that character motivation and actions have to be 100% believable and plots have to surprise at every turn, well, this show's probably not for you.",1458000000,,448,4.6923076923076925
8648670,5,B00J7ZSLFU,"I enjoyed this show immensely. It's light-hearted with plenty of very touching and heart-warming moments. As a nursing student, I also appreciated the medical aspect of the show. The plot is entertaining and the entire cast is just lovable - from the brilliant but love-naive Dr. Sezaki Kota, the dedicated and straitlaced Mako-chan, the quirky couple purser AKira-kun and Doctor Aoi, sweet and pure-hearted Noboru, and the ""three Musketeers"" of a ship crew, each episode will keep you alternately laughing and crying. I know I was!",1456099200,2,532,5.1976744186046515
8648671,5,B00J7ZSLFU,"I watched this principally because I find Shota Matsuda absolutely gorgeous. Hubby watched cause he likes the actress in it who was in Otenke Onee-san the season before this drama played. Well, we both enjoyed it a lot. It has humor, it has romance, it has family drama, it was work-place drama. And it has some very heart-warming moments.

Shota plays a smart and competent doctor who is something of a naive and innocent dork when it comes to romance. He constantly falls in love--every episode, some patient or relative of a patient becomes his target of ""I will marry."" Of course, it never runs smoothly for him. He's an endearing character. The supporting cast is a lot of fun and quirky. A real romance grows between the two principal characters, Kouta and the pretty nurse--not the spontaneous crushes Kouta falls into, but something real-- bit by bit, gently and slowly, which is quite nice.

The setting of the Inland Seto sea through which this floating medical clinic operates is beautiful, and the islands, with the aging communities make for an interesting geographical lesson. Gorgeous scenery and gorgeous Matsuda Shota (and the other young doctor is a beauty, too, even with glasses).

A very nice show.",1397433600,2,1219,4.907766990291262
