We can all use the very special knowledge he brings to his practice of herbology and herbal medicine. Reading his books is a good introduction to his methods and his peronal magick, watching him at work provides a remarkable portrait not only of the herbalist but also of his methods and his connection with the herbs he so lovingly grows and uses.",1175472000,8,507,4.462365591397849
