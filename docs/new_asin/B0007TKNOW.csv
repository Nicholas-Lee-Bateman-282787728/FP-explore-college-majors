8051668,4,B0007TKNOW,"Although more expensive than the one-box complete set which I understand is now out, this volume of the separate two-slipcase treatment is worth it in my view, better looking and possibly sturdier than the other.",1370822400,,212,5.085714285714285

8051670,5,B0007TKNOW,"''...the avenues and alleyways / Where the soul of a man is easy to buy / everybody's wheeling / everybody's steeling / all the low are living high / Every city's got 'em / can we ever stop 'em / some of us are gonna try'' (Mitch Murray & Peter Callander).

I had only viewed the inaugural season of Gerry Anderson's scintillating, espionage series ''The Protectors'' when it premiered and therefore acquired its second and final season (1973-1974) of 26 episodes on DVD (2005).  The superb main cast is comprised of Robert Vaughn (''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,'' ''The A-Team''), who plays pensive, debonair, and culinarily skilled, Yankee ''Harry Rule''; Nyree Dawn Porter, OBE (''Armchair Mystery Theatre,"" ''The Forsyte Saga''), who portrays warm and vulnerable, Roman/Brit ''Contessa Caroline di Contini,'' the most chic, sophisticated lady to ever grace a TV screen--milliners bedazzled her like a Royal and, hmm...doesn't she look ultrafeminine puffing delicately on that cigarillo?; and lastly, Tony Anholt (''Space: 1999,'' ''Howards' Way''), who acts the spiffy, sporty, Parisian ''Paul Buchet,'' a teckie who sometimes wears a vibrant cravat and even a purple sports jacket, once.  Strangely, no moniker appears below Anholt's picture in the opening credits.  Oh, ''Gus'' is the adorable, grey canine seen in the show's intro sharing Harry's breakfast; his sole sleuthing relegated to an innocuous stroll.

Ostensibly, there is no romantic nexus between Caroline and either of her two partners, however, they are concerned about one another's salubrity, solidifying an ace team, that does love--operating in conjunction with local police.  Nevertheless, sagacious Harry leads any clandestine strategy the Protectors embark, wherein each caper is solved with a melding of logic, intuition and, sometimes, happenstance.  Caroline has a couple of times remarked to Harry that he is a ''genius,'' however, the trio are deferential to one another's opinions.  The plots are feasible, considering each episode lasts under a half-hour.  Themes--the lot: dealing with/pursuing assassins; body, drug, and gun smugglers; clients on the run; financiers; hijackers; robbers; terrorists; as well as inheritances, purloined property and ransom demands; even the macabre and supernatural.

Their exploits take them from their home base in the pastoral enchantment of England, to bustling America, to a plethora of alluring locales in Europe.  The gadgetery employed at the time was novel: walkie-talkies and ubiquitous, multipurpose cameras being the order of the day, after all, this was before the era of cell phones and computer downloading, folks.  The cars?  Classy Citroens, and the like, of course.

The violence is never immoderate, but sociopathic criminals use it to facilitate their flagitious aims.  Harry and Paul do most of the combative muscling, where necessary, while Caroline employs whatever is handy to lambaste an overly adventurous miscreant.  But they all take their knocks, resilience being part of the game, as they always get back up, to protect social order.

Perhaps one has to be, cerebrally, the right person to enjoy this stylish series, that was, sadly, rescinded prematurely.  Do investigate ''The Protectors - Season Two'' on DVD, for a memory of 70's avenues and alleyways.",1314662400,3,3301,5.477317554240631
8051671,4,B0007TKNOW,"The second , and final, season of THE PROTECTORS finds Harry Rule the target of a top assassin; a cable car being held for ransom; hauntings.  Alot is said about the writing.  Look at the credits and you will like the likes of Brian Clemmens and Terry Nation.  At 30 minutes (with commercials) you certainly aren't going to have deep and insighful character development.  It's meant as quick and wild ride at the amusement park nothing more.  Take it at that and you'll be entertained.  Look carefully and you will see other actors from SPACE: 1999 and, in two episodes American actor Shane Rimmer (CPT Carter of the USS Wayne in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME).  This would be the second and final season.  The relationship between star Vaughn and the Andersons had never been good and this was the end of it.  Vaughn will always be remembered for U.N.C.L.E. but THE PROTECTORS is an interesting side note.  What I find amusing is that brand new sets are selling for a tenth of what Amazon is asking.",1261526400,,991,4.548022598870056
8051672,3,B0007TKNOW,"This is not the cool first season, but if you get it at a discount, then it's ok. The cheaper the price, the more it's nice.",1231372800,,124,3.8076923076923075
8051673,3,B0007TKNOW,"Those who have Set One of The Protectors will undoubtedly enjoy this second set.  Lots of international locations (not just the local studio at Pinewood is used here) making the series an interesting travelogue of international crime and glamourous detectives (Vaughn, Porter, and Anholt).  My main gripe is that the episodes could have been more interesting--there simply is not enough time to really establish the frame of the story--we leap into the drama instantly without really knowing why.

The episodes are short--around 20-25 minutes, so there isn't really that much plot development (unlike what you would see in a 30 minute episode of Danger Man), but if you like action, then give the Protectors a spin on the DVD player--the 70's never looked better.  Sadly, actors Anholt and Porter are no longer living.  Anholt died of a brain tumor a few years ago; Porter, to breast cancer--all good supporting castmates to Robert Vaughn, the leader of this well-dressed band of international superheroes.",1114646400,16,1006,5.185185185185185
