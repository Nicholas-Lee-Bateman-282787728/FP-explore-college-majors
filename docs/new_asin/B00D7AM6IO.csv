5776418,5,B00D7AM6IO,"As I was finishing up high school and still being addicted to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, I saw the next big thing:  Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.  After 20+ years, the franchise is STILL going strong!  For the last 2 years, each Season/Year of the shows have been quickly released on DVD.  I recently found this one at Best Buy and haven't seen these 10 episodes since they first aired back in late 1995.

The beginning of the story takes place after Master Vile, Rita Repulsa, and Lord Zedd turn back the Earth's time, thereby causing the Power Rangers to become helpless little children!  To make matters worse, the 4 archenemies come after them, fully grown!  But Vile stops the party short and tells everyone that he has his OWN master plan to take over the world for good.

So now the Rangers need some help, major big time!  This is where the Alien Rangers from Aquitar come in.  They can only survive with water and can't stay on Earth for a long time without rehydrating.  Of course, it happens to them several times throughout the episodes.  After Rita and Zedd's first plan to foil the Alien Rangers blows up in their face, Master Vile decides to leave the two archenemies to their own devices.  Next, they decide to send Rito and Goldar to Zordon's Command Center at the base.  After several attempts, they finally plant the implosion device.

As for the Power Rangers, each of them are sent on a quest to retrieve the Zeo Crystals (Zordon had previously broken them apart and scattered them to different time periods).  Each Ranger is faced with their own fears and learn more about their respective heritages.  Aisha, however, is the only Ranger that doesn't return with the final Crystal -- instead, she sends another female, Tanya, in her place.  As soon as Tanya arrives with the final Crystal, Billy activates it, restoring the Earth's time period back to normal -- as well as the Rangers themselves!

But NOT so fast, folks -- the Rangers enjoy their few moments of triumph before Rito and Goldar manage to break into the morphing grid and STEAL the completed Zeo Crystal -- oh no!!  And to make matters worse, the implosion device goes off.  After Alpha 5 teleports the Rangers outside, the Command Center blows up!  Wow -- what a great cliffhanger that was!  Thankfully, the storyline WILL resolve itself and continue into the next season -- known as Power Rangers Zeo.

For anyone who still loves watching Power Rangers, don't forget to watch Power Rangers Super Megaforce, currently airing on Nickelodeon, Saturdays at 12 p.m.  It's still as great of a show as ever, although there are brand new Rangers and baddies to contend with.  :)",1393372800,3,2661,4.718004338394794
5776419,4,B00D7AM6IO,"This is basically Season 3 vol 2 of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. The Power Rangers get turned into kids, and can't risk fighting Rita and Zedd's Monsters, for if they die as kids, they will never grow up to be the Power Rangers who have saved the Earth countless times. So Zordon summons Power Rangers from another planet, The Rangers of Aquatar to come fight evil, while Billy, Zordon and Alpha 5 try to figure out a way to restore the kid rangers.

After watching this DVD, as much of an end to Mighty Morphin that this miniseries is, it is also an introduction to the Zeo crystals which is the focus of the next season Power Rangers ZEO.

I rated this only 4 stars, it is awkward watching these aliens sometimes, it's a departure from the standard cut and paste morphing and zord scenes. The most awkward part is when the alien rangers morph, they end up all speaking over each other, which is in harmony until the point they say there power color, and it becomes a distorted mess of words. It's just not quite as awesome as watching the human rangers who we've all been watching all this time.",1390089600,,1098,4.430693069306931

8590282,4,B00D7AM6IO,"""Mighty Morphin' Alien Rangers"" serves as a bridge between ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"" season three and ""Power Rangers Zeo."" The Ranger, transformed into children by Master Vile at the end of season three, call upon the Rangers of Aquitar for assistance in keeping the Earth safe while they work to turn themselves back into adults. Along the way, Goldar and Rito Repulso destroy the Ranger's Power Coins, ensuring that they won't be able to recover their previous powers. Billy manages to turn himself back, but then cannot go on the Zeo quest, in which the Rangers recover the pieces of the Zeo crystal to fix time. The scenes with the Aquitar Rangers are fun, but the brevity of this mini-series makes it difficult for them to leave a lasting impression. Like season three, this ends with a cliffhanger that's only resolved in ""Power Rangers Zeo.""",1500336000,,854,4.896551724137931
