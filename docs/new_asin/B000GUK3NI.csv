8134730,5,B000GUK3NI,"Whether you like, hate, or don't know Armando Iannucci, you should give this underrated series a shot. Hard-core fans will love this together with people who have never seen his material, or people that have and didn't like it. It's a peculiarly unknown series that deserves more airplay.",1316908800,,288,5.020833333333333
8134731,5,B000GUK3NI,"The Armando Iannucci shows, a collection of passing thoughts played out in random skits, each episode exploring a train of thought or idea tangent. But not so confusing as it sounds, Armando himself appears, talking through these idea, with skits following, some re-occurring characters and skits. Pretty dark in places, theres the man who's literally being ""bored to death"", or the ""tooth fairy"" but always honest, individually dark comedy. I haven't seen anything like this in a while. I love it!
If you liked this you'll like Funland, Monkey Dust, Snuff Box.",1209513600,2,561,5.108695652173913
