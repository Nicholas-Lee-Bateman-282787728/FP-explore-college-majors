7862294,5,6304132700,"I've been wanting to buy this for so long but the price has been ridiculous. Finally someone was selling it for a reasonable price. I'm so happy to finally have it on DVD but the weird thing is the voice actors are different in this DVD. I don't know why the British voice actors were replaced by American actors. But at least Bob Hoskins was still in this version. It's not a huge deal breaker for me, I've been wanting this DVD for so long I'm just happy to finally own it.",1512950400,,475,4.173913043478261

7862303,5,6304132700,"It's a tradition for me to watch the Queen's Message every Christmas Day at noon.  So this past Christmas, (Dec 25, 2009),  this show came on immediately after the Queen's message was over and I chose to watch it in its entirety. Because I was taping it at the same time, I had to use the faciliites for a few minutes and missed the last five minutes of the show.  Unfortunately, my VCR didn't taped the last five minutes.  So I bought the VHS tape online and have watched it at least three times now.

A beautiful poignant story that's a must see for kids today.  I only wish I could buy the TV show version, which came out between 2002-2005, online as well.

Definitely a good show to watch over and over again.  I would highly recommend it to anybody from 10 to 100 years old.",1264809600,2,779,4.2517006802721085
