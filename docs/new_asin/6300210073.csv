7805053,5,6300210073,"When you see what Little Rascals episodes are included on Volume 2 of this collection you will wonder why they did not just make this the first in the series. This tape offers up four merry misadventures:

(1) ""Hook and Ladder"" (1932) has the Little Rascals responding to a newspaper headline asking the public to answer all fire alarms because of a manpower shortage. The result is some the best machinery gimmicks the series every produced as gang creates their own fire trucks and respond to a real fire. Kids today are still going to be impressed by what the gang puts together for this one. This two-reeler features Spanky, Dickie, Stymie, Spud, and Dorothy.

(2) ""The First Round-Up"" (1934) has the gang setting out for a camping trip that they expect will last at least a week (but Wally's dad thinks they will be back as soon as it gets dark). Wally, Stymie, Tommy and the others head off without Scotty and Spanky, telling them they are too little. Of course, the duo responds to the challenge. Another classic episode.

(3) ""Teacher's Beau"" (1935) has the gang in shock when Miss Jones announces on the last day of school that she is getting married and that their teacher next fall will be ""Mrs. Wilson."" Of course the kids miss the point and go to great ends to make sure they do not lose their beloved teacher by getting her fiance to dump her. This one features Spanky, Alfalfa, Scotty, Buckwheat and Stymie.

(4) ""Hearts are Thumps"" (1937) focuses on Valentine's Day which inspires Spanky, Buckwheat and Alfalfa to start the He-Man Woman-Hater's Club. However, as soon as Darla makes goo-goo eyes at Alfalfa, he leaves the club, uttering that immortal line, ""I have to live my own life."" Another classic episode that is certainly one of their most memorable.

In fact, Volume 2 of the Little Rascals collection offers up three absolute classics, which is pretty good as far as these things go. The episodes are introduced by Leonard Maltin, who co-authored ""Our Gang: The Life and Times of the Little Rascals,"" so he is able to offer up some expert commentary coupled with the affection of a true fan.",1098921600,,2116,4.692722371967655
