8439144,5,B004RPPXGK,"If your child is interested in owls, or if you are teaching a unit on owls, this video is highly entertaining and educational. The ""Flight School"" segment is hilarious! Who knew that graceful flying wasn't instinctual?",1462147200,,218,5.083333333333333
8439145,1,B004RPPXGK,"I bought this for a lesson and hands-on science activity.  My 4th grade gifted class studied about owls and we were going to watch Backyard Barnyard Owls prior to dissecting owl pellets.  I received it at the beginning of March took it to school to be used this week..  When I went to play it, it didn't work.  I gave it to our school technology expert.  He tried it on three different computers.  He said it was defective. The kids and I were disappointed.  I see there is a window for returns and I missed it.  April 1st was the deadline for returns.  I'll certainly check to make sure that a dvd works when I receive it next time.  I think since it was defective, I should be able to return it, though.  I would want another dvd, not my money back!",1461283200,,751,4.21830985915493
8439146,5,B004RPPXGK,"Absolutely loved this DVD, even more than the ones that are more polished and filmed inside of the professional owl boxes. The best thing about this one is that the 30"" deep x 14"" x 14"" box with a straight half door opening is that is was large enough to contain Dad, Mom, and the four grown owlets. It was much more community minded for Dad, especially with the amount of time he had to spend in terrible weather collecting their dinners. Yikes! Hunting for six night after night. At the end, he was able to get in from the cold, rain, sleet, and snow.  Since owls have no water proofed feathers, this is  - to my mind and reasoning - the most humane of all the many films I've watched so far. The owl pair returned several times, so they must have agreed.

Plus, it was such fun to see the owlets via that open door as the grew up, shoving each other around for the best rats and mice. Yum!",1454976000,,892,4.174418604651163

8439150,5,B004RPPXGK,"I am a third grade science teacher and my students dissect owl pellets.  We spend a week doing owl activities and I wanted an owl movie to show the students. I picked this movie because it is 30 minutes, which is a perfect amount of time for the classroom.  It had great owl shots and a lot of the information was related to what we learned in the classroom.  It was a great ending and review for a fun week.  My students LOVED this movie.  Many of my students copied down the name of the movie because they wanted their parents to order it so they could watch it again at home.",1369526400,4,578,4.125
8439151,5,B004RPPXGK,"The video gives folks a chance to see the unseen, mysterious side of an owls life from the beginning. This would be good to be used along with a biology class on the food chain.",1360281600,,177,4.085714285714285
8439152,5,B004RPPXGK,"This is a wonderful video about Barn Owls.  My family and I've watched this at least once daily since we received it.  I only wish it were longer.  If you love watching and learning about owls, do yourself a favor and check out this video.",1306195200,4,239,4.266666666666667
