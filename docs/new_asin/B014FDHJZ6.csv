And the BBC, sadly, does NOT release EVERY one of his broadcasts performances or PROMS appearances to worldwide audiences on dvd.  A pity.  Had to buy this because I was tired of watching clips on YouTube.  And on the dvd, you see not only a seamless, fantastic, tribute concert, but angles not seen on YouTube.  The 3 soloists are terrific and well chosen.  I do wish vocalist Claire Martin had been given 2 or 3 more additional songs to sing; instead of 1 and a half (I count ""half"" cuz of her duet w/ Seth MacFarlane).  But I'm sure The Royal Albert Hall and the BBC had time constraints put on Maestro John Wilson.  But c'mon John, honey.  Cut the number from Guys & Dolls if that's the case.  Oh well.  The music could not be played any better by any ensemble out there... anywhere.  This is the genre for which Wilson founded his hand picked orchestra, in 1994, specifically for.  And his string section ""shimmers"" as everyone else in this 'band' has a sass and swagger and patina of sheer precision and perfection and plays their hearts out!  And their ebullient, gently demanding but oh so fun and charismatic leader John Wilson has a 'beat' that can't be beat.  Watching him 'feel' the music and dance on the podium alone would be worth the price of admission were I able to attend that 2015 Prom.  If you can get this dvd... BUY IT!  You will watch and tap your foot to it again and again.  Ol' Blue Eyes would've been proud!",1493769600,,1606,4.434931506849315

The music is great, the singing is great, and the orchestra is terrific!

- Mr Amazon, do I get something for correcting the silly information?! -",1448409600,,364,4.432835820895522
