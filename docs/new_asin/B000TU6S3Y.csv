Tho this is a whimsical movie, I believe you next reader will enjoy the wonderful scenery in Africa and how wild animals band together to save one of tgeir own by using a human who cares.",1436832000,,417,4.036144578313253
8210933,5,B000TU6S3Y,"If you're like me you've found that a lot of Hollywood's children movies can sometimes seem cynical, immature, and overall just plain unintelligent (save of course for Pixar and the like). Now, a friend of mine who works as a conservationist recommended U'Bejani for my kids. It seemed harmless enough so I took the recommendation and popped it in. Turns out it's a great gift for the whole family! The talking animals are a hoot and actually have some wit. The lead actor was funny and believable even in the ridiculous situations being surrounded by talking wildlife. The tone is playful but has a good message about saving endangered species. I actually watched the entire movie with my kids and obliged when they wanted to watch the movie again as soon as it finished!

Seriously, this is loaded with lots of funny moments and moves at a brisk pace. As a parent, what more do you want for something that can entertain the entire family? Definitely recommended.",1324425600,,964,4.772455089820359
8210934,5,B000TU6S3Y,"My grandkids and their friends LOVE this film. So did I! Not many movies can truly appeal to
both young and old alike. I really enjoyed ""visiting"" Africa in this movie; the continent
is really beautiful. The story is amusing and educational because it enlightened me about
the very serious subject of poaching. I love animals and have long enjoyed films about them
(funny or dramatic). This film is just as humorous as ""Zoo Keeper"" or any of the ""Dr. Doolittle""
series, but, I believe, it's set in a better location and has more educational value.
The DVD ""extras"" about the animals are fun too.",1324339200,,595,4.6761904761904765
8210935,5,B000TU6S3Y,"I sat down to watch ""Ubejani"" the other day with a couple of kids. I had seen it before in its regular release, so I planned to watch a few minutes, then slip off to my computer. I ended up watching the whole film. Its one of those kinds of movies once you start watching you get hooked again. Especially this newly released version which is better than the original.  It is a humorous movie with a charming cast of humans and animals, and has a bit of something for everyone.
It's about an American retired cop who ends up in Africa trying to save a game reserve, aided by some wonderful talking animals, a pretty and smart young woman, and some whacky, but loveable locals.  The kids loved it, and actually learned some things from it. I enjoyed it too, and liked seeing the new added features that were not in the earlier version of the movie.........",1324339200,,854,4.39873417721519
8210936,3,B000TU6S3Y,"A slightly dopey story line (guy can understand the speech of animals when wearing a certain hat) and rather slow moving, but has some cute animal photography.",1303948800,,159,4.925925925925926
8210937,5,B000TU6S3Y,"This film first grabs you with its close-in shots of African wildlife - you really feel like you're there, a few feet from lions and elephants. The story is fun -- a big-city detective out of his element in the wilds of Africa -- and you come to love the rhythms of Africa, and the animals there that need our protection.

U'Bejani entertains in the same way that a good Disney film works -- it is geared towards kids, but adults will also be amused and engaged. I'd recommend it for the entire family!",1263168000,2,502,4.340425531914893
8210938,5,B000TU6S3Y,"While obviously geared towards children, this is a film the entire family can enjoy.

Beautiful nature photography of the African safari with the lead actor, Wayne Crawford, right in the middle of the action.  Crawford's character learns a lesson that we all can learn from to better appreciate mother nature and those beautiful beings that we share this planet with.

The film has humor, poignancy and plain good fun.  I highly recommend it to everyone - especially families.",1263081600,3,476,5.064102564102564
