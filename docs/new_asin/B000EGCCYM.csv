8109006,5,B000EGCCYM,I have several copies of this one dvd as I have different homesteads. Down to earth and simple program that DOES give you results!,1376697600,,130,4.458333333333333
8109007,1,B000EGCCYM,"I don't know what the other reviewers are referring to...I didn't see anything that allows for household items, chairs and such.  You have to listen to John ramble on to get to the exercises...his dogs can't even stay awake during this.  I fast forwarded through the nutrition but it looked ok and informative.  It probably would be better also if he would remove his toupee as I was distracted by how awkward it was to watch.

I was looking for simple exercises for an family member that has never exercised but this did not fit the bill.",1360195200,,539,4.525773195876289
8109008,1,B000EGCCYM,This looks like it was made by one person with a video camera.  He actually bumps the camera once and it's not even edited out.  If this was a youtube video it might be worth your time but this is a waste of money,1230768000,3,213,3.8181818181818183
8109009,5,B000EGCCYM,This is a very good product.  I can't add much more than what others have except that if you buy the DVD version then you can mix and match the order of what you do.  It keeps it fresh.,1195948800,5,185,3.717948717948718
8109010,5,B000EGCCYM,"I saw this on TV about a year ago. It seemed to be a ""no nonsense"" workout for ANYONE to do. This gave it a ""too good to be true"" quality. I checked it out of the library and have done it for a month now. This is a no bull@#$% workout.  Anyone can do it and it does NOT require special equipment.  A kitchen chair and a couple of free weights (I used bricks at first) is all you need. THIS GUY IS NO PHONEY! You do the exercises and workout along with him. They will challenge you BUT you go at your pace. He emphasizes that you go at your own pace and is encouraging through the whole thing. John kind of does a total lifesyle approach (mental, spiritual, nutritional and physical). It is worth every penny. YOU WON'T BE SORRY.",1190678400,9,728,4.083916083916084
8109011,4,B000EGCCYM,This is step by step good old fashioned working out. If you work out on a regular basis and want to add strength training to your routine - i highly recommend this video,1183507200,3,169,4.151515151515151
8109012,4,B000EGCCYM,"This is my first type of exercise video.  I really liked it because it is simple exercises that you can do at home and don't need any fancy equipment.  I can already tell I have more strength, especially in my arms.",1181174400,6,215,4.219512195121951
8109013,5,B000EGCCYM,"I first got the John Basedow tape after seeing his infomercials on tv...I figured if this guy can do it so can I.

I didn't know what to expect. When I got the tape I loved it!

Not only is the tape easy to follow, but it is totally inspirational as well. John not only uses physical motivators, but mental motivators as well...using visualizations like, ""reach for your dreams...you can do it.."" It was uplifting...fun...easy, and it works! Thanks John for now being a part of my life. You're the best.
