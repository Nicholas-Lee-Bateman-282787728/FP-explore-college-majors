8228669,4,B000XJO10I,"This series of short films is a reflection of the experiences I had while living in Umbria for 6+ years. As one reviewer noted, ""Images Of Umbria,"" is not your average travelogue or narrative. In fact, it is a very personal project, its narrative realized almost entirely through images and music, addressing different themes and feelings.

""Images Of Umbria"" is also an attempt to show the region from both an historical and current-day perspective, to allow the viewer a certain latitude of imagination, and to inspire his or her own personal connection with the stories. It is a work that I am proud to have produced, and I sincerely hope that you will enjoy it.

8228670,4,B000XJO10I,"As the copy on the back cover says, this is not your average travel video. The DVD is actually seven short films - each with a different theme - but all are set to images and music. There is not a single word of dialogue throughout the entire 60+ minutes, and that makes for a very serene and interesting experience. This is a perfect video for viewing after a long day of work or if you are feeling stressed out, whether or not you have a particular affinity for Italy.

This DVD is not a tourist guide in the common sense of the word, but there is something about the way the films are made that makes you want to visit Umbria. As the DVD cover states, it's a calming escape to a beautiful place. It's for travelers, explorers, wanderers, discoverers.",1235779200,3,753,4.340425531914893
