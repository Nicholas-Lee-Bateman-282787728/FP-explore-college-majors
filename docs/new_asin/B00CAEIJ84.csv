This western has the usual theme of a prominent man who secretly commits crimes with his gang, an innocent man who is wrongfully accused, and an undercover detective who joins a criminal gang to get the goods. Its seems a little over-complicated in its story.",1508716800,,1981,4.558988764044944

8579190,3,B00CAEIJ84,"I realize this is not a ""major"" motion picture. It was simply another one of those ""oaters"" released in 1936 to fill a ""double-bill"" on a weekend for the kids ... and a few adults ... who loved the ""Westerns"". However, it was the first movie for the ""star"", Tex Ritter. Perhaps for personal reasons, I love the film because I knew the star. Tex was to eventually become one of the top rated western actors as well as a best-selling recording artist for Capitol Records. He performed the trademark song for the award-winning movie, ""High Noon"". The producers realized something was ""lacking"" when previewing the completed film. Someone suggested they insert the song in the motion picture, and it reportedly ""did-the-trick"". When Tex appeared on my radio show, I asked him to give the listeners his response after receiving accolades for singing the song in the memorable film starring Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly. Tex replied, ""I simply sang th' song. I didn't write it, just sang it. I was very fortunate to be chosen to do th' job.""",1453939200,2,1034,4.75

It actually has an actual plot to the story with interesting characters and very decent acting to boot.  I just wish all the western movies could live up to this one.  Enjoy!!",1393632000,,250,4.511111111111111
