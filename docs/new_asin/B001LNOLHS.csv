I purchased the Sinister Cinema DVD a couple of years ago and was not particularly impressed with the picture quality. There is very considerable digital artifacting, like a bad JPEG file, and the night scenes are pale and flat. My impression was that the film was too long for one single-layer disk and that it must have been overcompressed, thus the mediocre image quality.

I just purchased the official Lenfilm DVD from a website that specializes in Russian DVDs because I was dissatisfied with the quality of the Sinister product. It's nicely packaged: It comes in a giant jewel case rather than a standard DVD case, but that's just glitter. The image is very soft (SC's is not). The night scenes, rather than being pale, are so black that often nothing at all is visible (whereas, in the SC DVD, the image is perfectly clear, if not beautiful). In fact, the blacks on the Lenfilm DVD are so deep that they cannot be opened up by turning up the brightness; there is no information in 100% black. And, in places there are the fine horizontal lines that one sometimes sees in transfers from older videotape; these are not present in the Sinister product.

So, what are we to make of this? It's apparent that Greg Luce did not use the Russian DVD as his source; there is no way he could have gotten the image he did from the dreadful official DVD. Perhaps the SC version is from an earlier videotape release; there is an occasional sign of very minor tape damage in the Sinister image. The Lenfilm DVD represents a 2007 remaster which is touted on the front, but it's pathetic. (It also is on a single disk, so my theory about compression being responsible for the quality of the SC image is not proved.)

The Russian DVD site price is twenty bucks and the image is awful. If the subtitles are bad, as the other reviewer claims, that is to be laid at Lenfilm's door: The subtitles on the Sinister Cinema version are identical, since the SC DVD is from a Lenfilm source originally. By the way, the Lenfilm DVD I own is definitely not a bootleg; it has both the official holographic stickers.

Greg's copy may not be beautiful, but it's much better than the official release. If anyone knows of a better version, I invite them to inform Kress del Rey at Hotmail.",1282089600,,2404,4.5813953488372094
8319062,2,B001LNOLHS,"I know this is only $7 but it's honestly not worth the money.  The quality was crap, there was a green line on the bottom of the screen from beginning to end and the translation was horrible.  Not only that, but it looks like it was a homemade DVD.  If I wanted to settle for that, I could have burned it myself for free. If I knew how, which I don't, which is why I bought this.

So if you're not satisfied watching this fantastic series on YouTube (which has superior quality compared to this) and want it on DVD, then I'd suggest shelling out the extra ten bucks for the official one.",1281398400,4,587,4.168141592920354
