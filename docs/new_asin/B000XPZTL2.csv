Gordon Hinckley on Zion's Bank Board stole our goldmine, March 23, 2008
Reviewer:  6th/7th Seal Overlap ""truth coming forth"" (Missouri) - See all my reviews
This is true regarding illegal actions on the part of Mormon leaders. However, the majority of the members of the LDS Church are innocent, yet blindly obedient and they do believe in polygamy (which is an abomination as stated in the Book of Mormon - now altered since 1837 to change the identity of God). They believe the Prophet ""will never lead them astray.""
Gordon B. Hinckley while on the Zion's 1st Nat. Bank Board instigated the theft of my husband's gold mine (now called the Bullfrog mine) worth $660,000,000 after core drillings were assayed in 1983. Barrick Gold was part of the theft as well. Judges, lawyers, were bought off to rule against well-documented ownership including receipts and quit-claim deed. A friend in the CIA warned, you'll never win in courts - the Mormon Mafia own all of the Judges. This has proved to be true. Cars have been totaled, attempts on our lives due to the documentation detailing the theft, assasination/sabotage attempts, and corruption.
All temple going members take a satanic blood oath (much like the Freemasons) to not tell or ""suffer your life to be taken"" and they consecrate everything to the church - not to God. The Book of Mormon was altered in 1837 changing the identity of God to multiple Gods just as the First Vision of Joseph Smith was altered politically by infiltrators 33rd degree masons Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball (see HCK biography pg 11 - swears to angels that he has always been true to masonic satanic blood oaths).
Joseph Smith did sin, lusted after women, and fell as a prophet while justifying polygamy which has never been of God. The Original Book of Mormon is worth reading as it is a pure history of the people of America who knew prophetically of God. These are the ""other sheep"" that Christ went and taught as He said before He ascended into the Heavens and Descended in Power and Great Glory from the Heavens in America; a Blessed Land. The Mormon Church today is one of the most evil church; ""The Great and Abominable"" as stated in the Original (not altered) Book of Mormon.
However, all should study early Christian Church History to see the corruption involved early on in the Christian Church as well. Early Christian writings were ordered to be destroyed by Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria to suppress women and to hoax the celibacy of Christ. Study how the Bible was compiled by learned, uninspired men - not by God who allows Free Agency. It is time for ALL religions to be cleansed just as Christ cleaned our the Temple.",1206144000,2,2710,4.751592356687898
