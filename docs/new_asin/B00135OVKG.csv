8249296,5,B00135OVKG,"I had always wanted to walk some of the trail, and this DVD has pushed me to doing it. Great photos from the entire trail length accompanied by nice, relaxing music. I didn't want a narration nor did I want words plastered all over the screen while I was trying to enjoy this presentation. No advertising either! It was relaxing and very enjoyable. I have used this a background on the TV when I have people over and it is a great conversation starter. Oh, and the producers were not on an ego trip and put themselves in every shot or try to sell you anything.",1299542400,2,560,4.2924528301886795
8249297,3,B00135OVKG,Not bad if you are looking for some relaxing pictures and soothing music about the Appalachian Trail. A slide presentation put to music.,1287446400,2,136,4.956521739130435
8249298,3,B00135OVKG,"Nice photos and music - relaxing - great scenic still shots.  No action video, just lots of still photos back to back with little transition effects.  More like a long powerpoint slide show of images (photos) with soft music in the background (mostly flute or that little bell).  Nothing else besides photos/music, no narration and no text on the screen (or on the disk as PDF and no behind the scenes etc).  No way to know what you are looking at or where, other than ""somewhere"" along the Trail (But where along the Trail??? And in what State???). Very frustrating to watch, if you have not hiked the App Trail a hundred times, so you know exactly what you are looking at when you see a given photo (what location?).  It starts in Georgia and goes to Maine, but without narration or text on the screen to tell you each photo's location, you are completely lost (where does one State start and end?).  After a while, it all just runs together into a pretty blur of images.  You don't know what State the photo is in or what location in that State it is for a given photo, so you might go there.  Again beautiful photos.  But more like a teaser - now I have to buy another DVD with words, text or a PDF etc to explain it all, so I can figure this one out.  There were a few Lakes, mountain sites and Fall color areas I'd like to go visit and see, but how?  I can't hike the full 2175 miles so I want to pick and choose.  BUT The DVD told me nothing!  Odd that subtitles, hearing impaired, or a commentary option were not present for those of us who have not been there or for the disabled who cannot hike.  Nice photo collection but frustrating.  I want to know more!  Now I have to spend more money to find out.  Hopefully there's a better DVD out there with narration etc.  I bought this NOT knowing all this upfront. Not a total loss but a loss.  Beware what you are buying.",1252886400,2,1877,4.236619718309859
8249299,5,B00135OVKG,"As thru hikers Windtalker and Mom did a great job capturing the essence and the spirit of the trail.  As a 2006 thru hiker I often dream of the adventures and the sights and the sounds of the trail.  Short of heading back to Springer and heading north, this is the second best thing to do.  Thank you Randy and Georgia.  Thanks for the memories!  It would make an excellent present for any AT thru hiker, section hiker or hiker wanna be.  Get it!
