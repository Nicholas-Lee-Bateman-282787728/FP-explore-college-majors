1050199,4,6305608288,"The Baron Von Kleist is a vague cousin of Count Dracula, Baron von Frankenstein, Mr. Hyde and this old chap - the Phantom of the Opera-. Yes Sir ! Altogether. It's really a pleasure to find them reunited in BARON  BLOOD, directed by Mario Bava in 1972.
The action is set in a castle (  ghosh !) near Vienna, Austria. Nowadays. Elke Sommer - the girl with the  mini-skirt - is in love with the american heir of Baron Blood. And, blinded  by love and the fog, they set free the bloody Baron and lose the  incantation to send him back to hell ( ghosh ! again ).
So the baron, who  loves to torture people before killing them, is going to chase the couple  but won't bother at all Joseph Cotten, the new owner of the castle.
The  copy presented in this DVD presentation is first-class with no white or  black spots at all. So you will enjoy the long chase in the fog and the  interesting special effects. Of course, you have to be, in the first place,  a movie lover who is curious and who won't be afraid of the numerous zooms  (forwards and backwards) put in BARON BLOOD, a Mario Bava gimmick by  excellence.
A DVD dedicated to the nostalgic ones.",956275200,17,1145,4.269767441860465

1050467,5,6305608288,"Another fine 1970s gothic horror movie with atmospheric music to boot! I loved it and although it didn't have lots of splatter, I prefer it that way. Mario Bava comes up with a movie like no other for the time. Starring Actress Elke Sommer and Actor Joseph Cotten (Tora! Tora! Tora!, Niagara). These are the most recognizable in the movie for me. Eva (Elke Sommer) works at the very castle that Baron Blood (Baron Otto Von Kleist) lived to help restore it for tourism. When a relative of the Baron shows up to seek the truth of his unfortunate ""ties"" to the sadistic Baron, things seem to take a turn. One night after meeting with his other relatives he is staying with, Eva and him embark to the Castle. He brings an ancient parchment that has an incantation. Against Eva's words, he sits the parchment down and reads it out aloud. The words echo through the chamber and apparently the entire Castle. They stop after hearing strange noises coming from all angles in the room. The only light and comfort they have for the moment is the fireplace nearby. A sudden wind comes in and sweeps the old parchment into the fire, burning it almost completely before they can get it out.
Unknowing to them both, the body and spirit of Baron Blood has been awakened and he wants nothing more than revenge on the living occupants of his estate and the surrounding town.
That's just the mere start of this movie. I found it both entertaining and a thriller. I used to own the DVD on this one, but this edition is far superior to that one.

Kino Lorber did a good job on this one. I would have liked some reversible graphics on the interior of the bluray package though. I'm sure there are plenty of graphic artwork available for that, but they only did the front cover and back.

1050468,2,6305608288,"Mario Bava is one of the most respected names in all of horror, but BARON BLOOD is a weak link in his resume'. The plot, about a ruthless Austrian nobleman brought back to a semblance of life to take up his brutal ways once again, is serviceable enough, but it never comes to fruition. There is a real dearth of action, and while there are successful moments scattered throughout BARON BLOOD Bava cannot maintain suspense or drama. To his credit, Bava emphasizes atmosphere over gore, and the violence is surprisingly restrained and delicately handled, but there are no thrills. Characters are dull and unrealistic, and Joseph Cotton fails utterly in his turn as the resurrected Baron. Elke Sommer is better as the leading lady, and she's certainly easy on the eyes, and an extended chase scene in which the Baron pursues her through the eerily lit shadows is one of the few times the film begins to realize its potential. Sadly, Bava can't keep it going, and for the most part BARON BLOOD is tepid and dreadfully slow, culminating in an unconvincing climax that is satisfying only in the sense that it brings the tedium to a close.",1438128000,,1132,4.722222222222222

Saw a lot of things that reminded me of Bloodborne, leading me to believe that Miyazaki is just as much of a 70's horror fan as I am. I mean there are at least two enemies that mimic the Baron's appearance, not to mention the castle itself. Reminded me of Yar' Guhl a lot.

Anyway, I digress. It's worth the watch of you like movies from this genre/era. Better that a lot of the things that came out in that era (story wise anyway), though I felt the special effects were quite lacking. It's pretty much a PG-13.",1437782400,3,578,4.302752293577981

This has a fair amount of gore, and atmosphere in the Bava tradition
The Blu Ray has a fair amount of extras such as a commentary by the great Tim Lucas, trailers ,etc..
The image quality on this is average at best. I may not be the most professional Blu Ray reviewer in terms of technical aspects or terminology of Blu ray but I can call it as I see it.
There are some great HD quality shots in daylight but inside the Baron's castle , the colors and image quality is basically bland. And the beginning has more grain than any other movie Ive seen.
It could very well be because of the quality of the negative used (it is 40 years old) and not the fault of Kino. At any rate this is still worth owning if you're a fan of the film and collect Blu Ray's.
If you own the DVD and are thinking about upgrading to Blu Ray, I leave that choice up to you. Blu Ray is a newer technology but DVDs aren't obsolete...and as long as you enjoy Baron Blood, own it either way you please.",1354147200,2,1248,4.161157024793388
1050586,4,6305608288,"We first saw this movie at the local drive-in (remember them?) We were teenagers; it was a horror movie double, and on the way home I had to get out of the car in the dark to open the gate at our farm's entrance!

The movie scared the living daylights out of every I knew.

Quite a good story. The plot centres around a Baron Von Kleist (known as 'Baron Blood'), dead for some 300 years. The Baron was legendary for his brutality and sadistism. A young couple go into the Baron's supposedly haunted castle, and utter an incantation which, they are told, will bring the Baron back to life (how many plots in movies hinge on people doing dumb things!!!!!)

Hearing creepy noises, they realize the Baron has come back to life. They decide to utter the words of recantation. But too late, they realize a puff of wind has blown the piece of paper into a fire they've lit. The rest of the movie features the Baron (whose body and face is rotted and horrible) running amok, murdering people, stunning others and placing them in spiked coffins (the black virgin) or impaling them on spikes.

The Baron is finally defeated when they turn to a witch for help. The witch is a reincarnation of one of the Baron's long-dead victims, and she takes great delight in extracting her revenge.

Many years later I saw it again. Although It made nothing of the impact it made on me in my teens, I thought it still measured up well.",1315094400,5,1411,4.4324324324324325
1050587,3,6305608288,"A malevolent supernatural force is unleashed, in director Mario Bava's Baron Blood (1972), a suspense thriller with some tense moments, a few nasty kills, and some atmospheric and stylish cinematography.  The film marks the first collaboration of Bava and producer Alfredo Leone, who would go on to make three other films in about a three year period

Peter Kleist (Antonio Cantafora) comes to visit his uncle Dr. Karl Hummel (Massimo Girotti) in Austria.  Peter has an interest in the Kleist family's notorious ancestor, Baron Otto von Kleist (Joseph Cotton), who because of his proclivity for inflicting torture, was known as `Baron Blood'.  Young Kleist immediately gets together with Eva Arnold (Elke Sommer), an architectural student who as access to the old castle where the Baron once lived.  It takes a couple of tries, but by reciting some incantations, the pair succeeds in calling forth the spirit of the long dead Baron, who rises from his grave.  After a little medical attention, the hideous looking Baron begins to take lives.

Joseph Cotten appears in a dual role as Alfred Becker, a wealthy man bound to a wheelchair, who purchases the castle at auction.  Much of the middle part of the film is spent building up suspense, as the Baron takes a break from killing, and Becker begins restoring his castle.  Eva and Peter get clues how to send the Baron back to the dead, with the help of a medium named Christina Hoffman (Rada Rassimov), and a perceptive little girl.  The resolution to the tale is a little cheesy, and because it could easily have been more graphically violent, slightly disappointing.

Bava's cinematic talents are highlighted, when a terrified Eva scampers through the castle, and then in a tense and spooky nighttime chase sequence, Elke Sommer does some serious running through the foggy streets and alleys of the town.  Unfortunately there aren't too many moments like this.  Utilizing some cool locations and spooky settings, combined with his cinematic expertise and creative camerawork, Bava attempts to give the film a dark atmosphere.  It works in some places, as Baron Blood kind of has the vibe of a 60's Hammer horror film.  The grotesque killer is pretty effective in the beginning, while operating in the shadows.  Ms. Sommer overdoes the screaming a bit, but is not too bad in her first horror film.  Joseph Cotton, 67 at the time, gets a chance to be a little evil and sadistic at the finish.

1050722,2,6305608288,I don't really understand the hype around this director. His work is nothing like Alfred Hitchcocks and the only thing that made me add a star to this movie was the sets which were very good at least for this movie. I couldn't stand the wooden dialogue and found the acting rather poor much like Argento's work. Some of my friends talk none stop about Italian horror but I find it to not be that good with the exception of Fuchi.,1290643200,2,429,4.308641975308642
1050723,4,6305608288,"I'm quite new to Mario Bava's films, and thanks to my film historian acquaintance, I have become more well-versed with this director's body of work and have some of his other films at home, for my viewing pleasure. I have to admit that I have watched works of the other Italian horror masters' such as Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento, and found those films to be a bit too much for my tastes, with lots of gore and sexuality, but I've come to really appreciate Bava's earlier movies for their great sense of Gothic atmosphere as well as creepiness, not to mention the attention paid to characterization.

In ""Baron Blood"", the story begins with a young graduate student, Peter Kleist (Antonio Cantafora) who is visiting his ancestral country, Austria. Peter lives with his uncle and meets an attractive woman, Eva (Elke Sommer) who is helping with the restoration efforts of a castle that used to belong to Peter's ancestor, Baron von Kleist, a 16th century nobleman who was evil incarnate. Peter is obsessed with unearthing the Baron's past, and has brought with him an old scroll which contains an incantation (and counter spell) that will awake the Baron's spirit from its fitful slumber. Peter convinces Eva to go to the Baron's castle and recite the incantation, not realizing that they are about to unleash a malevolent spirit who mercilessly kills the innocent. The rest of the story deals with Peter and Eva's efforts to banish the Baron's spirit to the hell that it came from.

I love Bava's attention to details and atmosphere, something I highly prize in horror movies (a quality that is sadly lacking in many contemporary horror movies) - from the first glimpse of the Baron's castle, a sense of pervasive menace permeates the film, and the viewer knows that sinister forces are afoot. The make-up of the Baron in his monstrous guise may be cheesy-looking, but very reminiscent of older monster movie classics, and I loved the sense of nostalgia evoked by the Baron's horrific visage. Highly recommended for fans of classic horror and Italian horror. And now, I'm off to watch ""Black Sabbath"" and ""Black Sunday""!",1256860800,6,2122,4.875346260387811
1050724,3,6305608288,"Baron Blood is another Mario Bava movie...Bava was an Italian horror director whose movies had MAJOR influence on American horror movies of the late 70's and 80's (including ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Alien"").  ""Baron"" may not be one of Bava's most well regarded but is one that falls under the better ""late-night"" horror fare by today's standards.  It is defintitely low budget and cheesy in parts - in other words clearly a ""B-move"" - but it combines elements of both being genuinly creepy at times, and at others being so bad it's good.""  Some of the shots of the castle inside and out and the Baron are very creepy!  The movie also stars the legendary Joseph Cotton!",1234656000,2,666,4.666666666666667
1050725,5,6305608288,"Elke Sommer plays Eva Arnold, an architectural student employed on the restoration of Baron von Kleist's creepy castle from the 11th century AD, whose boss introduces her to Peter, Kleist's American nephew, and a real good looker played by an actor who you'd never place as American.

Karl Hummel, the math professor, is played by Massimo Girotti, who stepped off the set of BARON BLOOD and onto the French locations of Bertolucci's LAST TANGO IN PARIS--quite a stretch for our Massimo!  Dr. Hummel has a lovely wife, a cottagey-type home in the Austrian village on the outskirts of the castle, and his daughter, Gretchen, a plain-looking redheaded tyke filled with mischief and given to spying.  There are so many scenes with Gretchen poking her head through the banister of the staircase, as the grownups talk on downstairs while drinking Austrian wine, that I expected she would get her head caught between the bars.  Instead she develops an unexpected acuity and she's the only one who a) can identify Joseph Cotten as Baron Blood and b) can tell Elke Sommer and Peter how to return Baron Blood back to his crypt, from which they have accidentally awoken him.  That little girl seems like a nut, and she's ugly as sin, but she's got brains and she's got courage.  Later she played an important part in Dario Argento's PROFONDO ROSSO, and still later she was the usher girl in Bava Junior's DEMONS.

BARON BLOOD is a terrifying Mario Bava shocker with a wicked cool performance by Joseph Cotten as the revived Baron von Kleist.  In his wheelchair and waxy makeup he seems treacherously close to death.  Indeed it's hard to imagine that Cotten himself would be alive for another 20 years after wrapping up his shoot here.  His face looks like it's been Botoxed long before anyone had ever heard of the term.  And yet his eyes ""glow with evil,"" as little Gretchen notes.  She's no dumbkopf that Gretchen.  A sinister bond seems to link the little girl with the ageless, cadaverous stranger in town: a takeoff on his role as Uncle Charlie in the Hitchcock-directed SHADOW OF A DOUBT I suppose?",1158624000,11,2093,4.780555555555556
1050726,4,6305608288,"This was the supposed sequel to Lisa and the Devil, Bava's shimmering, near-incomprehensible masterpiece.  In Baron Blood, Bava has toned the story line down considerably.  One of the overiding themes still is cause and effect; that is, in the world of Bava, our actions that we know are wrong but that we do anyhow can have horrifying consequences.  At least in this movie, the repercussions manifest themselves in the lifetimes of the principal characters.  The story resolution is much more believable (not to say digestable) than Lisa and the Devil.  Unfortunately, by stepping a little more into the mainstream with Baron Blood (less risks are taken with the principle characters this time around), Bava has sacrificed much of the haunting uneasiness that made Lisa so enjoyable.  He also doesn't have Telly Savalas in this film either!",1050537600,3,841,5.147058823529412

With atmosphere to spare, you'd think it would be better than it is. But ""Baron Blood"" comes off as a bunch of steam over nothing. The ""extra uncut footage"" is nothing more than a couple of rather tame gore shots. A tired looking Joseph Cotton wheels around an ancient castle as some REALLY dumb dodos recite an incantation to bring back a 16th century sadist who returns and chases Elke Sommer around through colored fog. Sommer (who was utilized to much better advantage in Bava's masterpiece ""Lisa & the Devil"") has nothing much to do here but scream and run. Rest of cast is below par in unexciting roles and the ""Baron"" is a messy looking mask in a black hat and cloak that may or may not be Cotton! This is such a ""PG"" excercise that it's OK for older kids and a total waste of time for adults. Nothing really much happens that holds your attention for very long.

If you have either the Blu-Ray or DVD, please clarify: Does this have the original Stelvio Cipriani score when released in Italy, or does it have Lex Baxter's eerie score for the US version when it arrived to American theaters in 1972? For once, the replacement score is far superior to the original. Les Baxter's score makes it a completely different movie, while after hearing it, Cipriani's music sounds like something written for a comedic Fellini film. If it's the Cipriani score on this product, and that's what the Rotten Tomatoes crowd has reviewed, no wonder the movie doesn't get five stars on every mention. My three stars given here are to avert changing the average since I haven't viewed the product.

Watch the Exorcist instead",1511222400,,439,4.238095238095238
7891880,5,6305608288,"If you love 70's horror films, this one is a must see.  I think it might be one of the best I've seen from that time era.  Amazing surreal scenery stunning visuals and genuinely creepy!  Story line kind of jumps around a bit but I love the castle in the movie and the music.  Once again a must see for 70's horror fans!",1502236800,,319,4.015873015873016
7891881,4,6305608288,"Entertaining and fun. I was initially interested in this movie because it starred Joseph Cotton. I am not a huge Mario Bava fan and the reviews on this one were mixed, but I decided to give it a try. I watched it online originally and just loved it! It has a bit of camp to it, but not overdone. There are genuine moments of suspense and some gore, but not too much IMO. The end is satisfying, with the exception of Elke Sommer. I find her to be the weak link in the entire film. She does absolutely nothing for me and drags down the scenes she is in. Joseph Cotton is excellent and I think he had fun in the role. It is worth watching and owning.",1497312000,,647,4.0625
7891882,2,6305608288,"It's worth watching this movie if only out of curiosities sake & to say that yes I've seen it all.  Any fan of Bravia's will tell you truthfully that ""Baron Blood"" is the so called weak link among his many other masterpieces.  A classic this is not but I do have somewhat fond memories of this film as I've must have seen it when I was very young.  It's the kind of movie that was on channel 5, 9 or 11 in NY.  The non network networks..

Joseph Cotton was a legendary actor who played in legendary movies.  Suffice it to say that this was not a feather in his cap.  He really hammed it up for this one & even as a youngin I understood that.  The rest of the cast I never heard of but they're mostly Italian actors/actresses.

The story centers on a young man researching his family ancestry in Austria & finds he's related to some guy who lived a long time ago who was a real psycho.  The kind of thing many of you will be thrilled to discover I'm sure.  This is the reason they have services like ""Family Ancestry"". No muss, no fuss & if you find out things that are not that flattering, then no one is forcing you to tell anybody.

Oh & as for the aforementioned Baron, he was a nobleman who lived in a castle &  he liked to spend his time by torturing & killing people by the score.  Why'd he do this you may ask & not just live the usual quiet life of an aloof aristocrat?  Maybe he was lonely, maybe he was bored, maybe he felt entitled or maybe he was just freakin' nuts who knows?

He made one big mistake by killing as the expression goes the wrong b! tch who was a powerful witch. One Elizabeth Holly, a redhead (aren't they all?).  The actress who plays her curiously enough I can't find a listing for in any of the credits but she was kinda cute in a 70's trashy kind of way.  She curses the Baron  by not only having him killed but by fixing it where he can come back to life over & over again, so she can do the same & kill him over & over again.  To think they weren't even married & she felt this way about the guy.

Naturally that dumb descendant of his reads from a enchanted scroll with his new girlfriend, even though being told what was going to happen does it anyway. ""Peter, he's a raving pyscopath, he's evil incarnate!  He's going to kill you & a lot of people.  The streets will run with blood!  This is the wrong thing to do Peter!""  ""Yeah, yeah, yeah whatever.  Get out of my face & don't ruin my fun, my will be done & that's the most important.""  But hey he wants to do what he wants to do & screw you all, a perfect man for today.  Of course when things go bad & it blows up in his face he's like, ""wasn't my fault"".  But in all fairness we wouldn't have a horror movie if he didn't do that now would we?  Well the Baron comes back to muck things up & where off to the races!  That's about it in a nutshell I think.

Again it's worth seeing once or maybe revisiting it, if like me you saw this ages ago in your childhood & want to take a look at it for nostalgia.  Other than that it's not a keeper I would say but I'm sure many of you would beg to differ.  Peace everyone!",1494028800,,3104,4.001628664495114
