1407955,5,B000059PPT,"I find it frustrating that American filmmakers cannot make a film as good as this one is.  The whole story of misplaced hopes and lost dreams on the dreary American landscape is more powerful in it's telling than many films have been.  The action of this film moves us from birth to death in a philosophical journey of the soul.  The arrival of these obviously hopeful and distraught people on American shores is like the rebirth many immigrants went through when they escaped their own countries and arrived here.  Dreams of streets paved with gold and the easy credit of American commerce is the undoing of many yet, here we see the disaster of it all.  One doesn't have to be a recent immigrant to experience the foibles of modern credit like our characters do.  They exemplify it though and it is to their peril that they do not understand it.  The closing scene where we hear the solitary gunshot is most powerful.  That it is done near a roadside zoo with it's caged animals is perfect because it portrays the cage our man has put himself into.  There is only one way out, he takes it.  Like many powerful financiers of the twenties who lost everything he does the only thing which will solve his problems.
The gunshot is his goodbye to his problems and the beginning of his new life.  A shame that American studios cannot produce movies such as this.  They are in need of lessons from directors who understand cinema and should study films of this type.  Maybe they will be able to improve the fare they offer to us.",1005868800,15,1523,4.514598540145985

1407981,5,B000059PPT,Herzog's most accessible film says as much about America as it does about the three unlikely vagabonds who arrive on its shores. The use of nonprofessional actors including Bruno S is essential to establish this level of authenticity.

1407986,5,B000059PPT,"""Stroszek"" stands out as the only&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Herzog/dp/B0001ZX0F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Herzog</a>&nbsp;film where the director demonstrates compassion. It is devastating and uncomfortable, and the character of Bruno S. largely digs his own hole, but Herzog allows him his dignity.

That means a lot. In ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Enigma-Of-Kaspar-Hauser/dp/B00005R248/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Enigma Of Kaspar Hauser</a>,"" Bruno S. played a noble savage who was cruelly misunderstood by the world. To drive the point home, he was depicted as a helpless man-child who couldn't wash or dress himself. He also obstinately insisted on anthropomorphizing apples rolling on the ground, and so forth.

But in ""Stroszek,"" Bruno comes across as a reserved and principled man. He is weak, and cannot physically protect his prostitute friend from her violent pimps. But he is courageous, and dares to approach and comfort her in their presence. He then gives her shelter and compassion, which is pretty much all he has to offer. The pimps humiliate him, but although he is powerless to resist, he does not grovel or break down. He leads a shiftless life, but he is quite level-headed. Herzog is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/usually/dp/6305972761/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">usually</a>&nbsp;uninterested in anything non-grandiose, but here, for once, he celebrates quiet dignity.

It is cruelly ironic that Bruno's compassion directly leads to his downfall, but in a way it emphasizes the integrity of his choice. He never backpedals or tries to withdraw from his commitment to Eva (not that he could if he wanted to, but still), and he only complains once, in a quietly bitter, unusually-worded monologue that sounds like someone who wants to desperately cry for help but forces himself, with great effort, to maintain a ""reasonable"" tone. You can't make a free choice if you don't feel the full impact of the consequences.

Still, although Herzog treats Bruno with probably the maximum amount of compassion that he is capable of feeling, he keeps a distance. Early on, a kindly doctor takes Bruno to a ward where prematurely born babies cling desperately to life. This at once reflects Bruno's own need for companionship, and his past as an abandoned child, but at the same time it suggests that there are living beings who are even more fragile than Bruno, and in greater need. In the second half of the film, they lose their trailer and the auctioneer shrugs and drives away when Bruno tries to talk to him in German, but honestly, what else was society supposed to do? The problems with this group's American life are really rooted in the fact that they are completely mis-matched and don't belong together in the first place. The surrounding Americans are rough, but nice, nicer than many of the Germans shown, and about as nice as you can expect from total strangers. The film is bleak, but it is not a bleak portrait of America per se.

""Stroszek"" is rich in detail, most of which is only indirectly related to the plot, but helps to make the film feel very real. The scenes of Bruno's life in Germany are taken directly from reality -- apparently he did indeed sing old songs in alleys, with accompanying commentary -- and the apartment shown is his actual residence. It creates a strange effect. Bruno's apartment is quite spacious, and contains old and valuable things. Based purely on the story told in the film, it is difficult to explain how Bruno came from this apparently well-to-do beginning to a life of frequenting seedy bars and befriending prostitutes. The film gives no backstory for the Bruno character. On the other hand, even if the apartment is inexplicable, it looks lived-in. The way Bruno's lines are written is also based on his peculiar form of self-expression -- the ""schematic diagram of how it looks inside"" is odd, but carries the weight of conviction. Perhaps this is what Herzog means by the ""poetic truth,"" that certain elements of reality can serve as an effective substitute for exposition, even if they superficially contradict some of that exposition.

Herzog's depiction of America is also full of fascinating details and minor touches -- the rural legends about drowned tractor drivers, the farmers' show of force over a disputed strip of land, the auctioneer's chant, and finally the mountain attraction. The driving scenes take place against a backdrop of gorgeous American sunset and mountain scenery. In the commentary, Herzog calls it artificial, but it's still amazingly pretty, and it reflects the group's optimism for their new life.

The ending, at a bizarrely run-down mountain attraction, comes across as extremely cold, and almost turns the film into a cruel joke -- one understands why it may have been a bit of a downer to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ian-Curtis/dp/B000002LGN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ian Curtis</a>. Fortunately, Bruno's vulnerable, but dignified performance softens Herzog's cruelty, and turns ""Stroszek"" into arguably Herzog's best film, possibly his most affecting one. Watching it now can even have an additional, unintentionally exhilarating quality, just to see the power of classic seventies cinema at its best, when it could manage to simultaneously be unconcerned with marketing and star power, and remain completely accessible, understandable, and thought-provoking.",1356912000,3,5558,5.586002372479241

1407999,4,B000059PPT,"The Bottom Line:

Strozek is undeniably slow at times, but it's so fascinatingly bleak in its depiction of middle America that the viewer can't help coming away impressed--throw in a couple of scenes that function perfectly as metaphors and linger in the brain (the perpetually dancing chicken, tiny baby with a vicelike grip) and it's a movie that I'll remember, even if I didn't enjoy it per se.",1239580800,,397,4.838235294117647
1408000,4,B000059PPT,"I missed out seeing the 70's films by German director Werner Herzog--after all, I was only a child at the time. Anyway, I recently viewed & reviewed the director's very weird, neo-horror flick HEART OF GLASS. In that review I expressed concern that Herzog had more or less ""lifted"" the styles of the great European directors of same era. However, I was interested enough to view Herzog's 1977 film STROSZEK. This film is more literal & realistic...AND very good.

Herzog follows in the footsteps of other talented directors in that he works with a sort of core or repetory group of actors who appear in one film after another. I recognized many faces from HEART OF GLASS also playing in STROSZEK.

At the center of the script is the character Stroszek, who I think is the same as the actor Bruno S., who is more or less playing himself. The American satrical director John Waters (HAIR SPRAY, PINK FLAMINGOS, POLYESTER, LOVE IN THE DUST etc.) is also known for casting people off the street to act in his films--often with good results. This seems to work for Herzog as well. Just as in HEART OF GLASS, you can catch a few actors who seem to be looking at the off-camera director during a shoot. Nonetheless, it's an interesting technique that can be traced back to the European mediaeval Miracle Plays.

Another production element that Walters & Herzog have in common is that pop music is an important component used to illustrate--or counterpoint--the script. Unlike Waters though, some of the music & sounds in Herzog's films are grinding & nerve rattling. There is good music too, such as in the movie's's opening sequence.

Stroszek is released from a ""reformatory."" You get the impression he's been in & out of jail and/or mental institution most of his life. One of the first things he does is to haul an accordian & some kind of percussion instrument in a beat up old wagon, taking his 1 man band into an alley where he gives a ""recital."" There are elements of Berlin ""dark cabaret"" in the performance that reminded me of today's Tiger Lillies ""Shockheaded Peter."" Stroszek's recital is wonderful.

Herzog sets his film in the underworld of the Berlin ""lumpen prolitariat."" This is the lowest strata of the low. (German theatre director Bertolt Brecht set most of his ""epic theatre"" operas & musicals in this milieu.) Stroszek is attracted to a young prostitute called Eva, and she in turn is totally dominated by her abusive pimp/boyfriend and his equally vicious associate. The movie is extremely brutal in these opening scenes, as Eva is physically & sexually abused & Strosek is physically & mentally abused by the louts.

In another apartment--or sharing the same apartment--there is a strange little man. He is the same actor who played a strange little man in HEART OF GLASS. He has the most fragile face I've ever seen.

The little man says that he is moving to rural Winconsin where a relative has a ranch (""pile of crap"" would be more apt.) He invites Stroszek & Eva to join him. Stroszek thinks it's a great idea & convinces Eva that this is just what they need to keep their relationship intact. This is like when a man & a woman can't get along, so decide to have a baby in order to improve their relationship. It's a recipe for complete d-i-s-a-s-t-e-r.

Wincosin is a bust. Other reviwers have covered the plot from that point, so I'll focus on a couple points that struck my fancy. As stated above, music plays a subtle role in the movie. The song EASY TIMES COME HARD FOR ME is playing on the radio in one secene. It is an instrumental version, but the lyrics, I feel, are relevant. ""Easy times come hard for me and oh, my darling/ time again to dream that you are coming home/Happy times I've had with you, do you know, my darling/ will there ever be a time I'm not alone?""

I'm not sure if the director assumed that everybody knew the un-sung lyrics, but for me the quoted verse above sums up Stroszek's mental/emotional impairment projected into his hopeless non-relationship with Eva.

Near the end of the film, the little man & Stroszek are on the run from the law (and that's another whole story). They go into a convenience store to purchase some on-the-lam provisions, and Strosek elects to purchase...a 30 lb. frozen turkey!

I believe STROSZEK is an imporant (AND entertaining) cross-cultural film...and what does Herzog do with the last precious minutes? He places his hero at a sort of barnyard animal freak show. You drop a coin in an open-view cage. In one cage when you drop in the coin, a miniature juke box starts playing & the chicken inside does a little dance! In another cage a chicken plays a piano, and yet in another a duck beats on a drum...and you know what? The little hen can really dance! She really does captivate attention.

The film concludes without even trying to supply any kind of ends-tied-up conclusion. This is a hallmark of European neo-realism. You can see this in Vittorio De Sica's  UMBERTO, D and Francois Truffaut's  THE 400 BLOWS. I appreciate this aspect because it's very true to life. No fudged, romantic endings.

Just more questions, often left unanswered.

1408001,5,B000059PPT,"At one point in Herzog's brilliant ""Stroszek,"" the mentally handicapped street musician Bruno (Bruno S.) and his physician are speaking.  Bruno is in despair at the sordidness and violence of life.  Taking him to one of the preemies in the hospital's neonatal ward, the physician holds out his two index fingers and the infant, scrawny, leathery, barely clinging to life, reaches up and grabs them so tightly that the doctor can lift him out of the cradle.  There is, he tells Bruno, a remarkable reflex grip in humans.  They hang on, no matter what.

The reflex grip seems to be one of the two themes running through this black comedy (is it really a comedy?  I'm not sure; Herzog defies easy genre) about three of life's rejects:  Eva the prostitute (Eva Mattes), the tiny ancient eccentric Mr. Scheitz (Clemens Scheitz), and Bruno.  Chased out of Berlin by thugs, they migrate to Wisconsin to begin a new life, only to discover that there are new and unfamiliar threats.  In Berlin, Bruno tells Maria in one particularly engaging scene, the Nazis brutally broke bodies.  Here, in the U.S., Americans politely break the spirit.

Still, the three characters' reflex grip tightens in rebellion against their fate.  Eva runs away from the worsening situation; Mr. Scheitz turns bandito; and Bruno, refusing to capitulate, asserts his grip by killing himself (presumably; it's a bit ambiguous).

The justly famous final scene features an antic and rather creepy funhouse into which Bruno that has cages of trained animals.  One of them is a dancing chicken, who does a slippery sort of mashed-potato dance to tinny, carnivalish music.  The chicken is a metaphor for the film's other theme, which is in continuous tension with the first:  the fact that fate, the system, the Man, call it what you will, plays the tune and the rest of us are chickens that dance.  Without the first theme, the film's message would be pretty dismal.  But even as dancing chickens, the grip reflex can help us preserve some degree of autonomy and dignity.

One of Herzog's very best, with an amateur cast, except for the incredible Eva Mattes, which is simply superb.",1215388800,10,2144,4.889196675900277
1408002,5,B000059PPT,"In the first half of the movie, Bruno and the old man are in Berlin yet and the old man is playing a classical piece on the piano. Soon after, those pimps bust in again and harass Stroszek.

1408003,5,B000059PPT,"With all the inherent contradictions that implies! The key image of a broken down car going round in endless circles from Herzog's earlier Even Dwarfs Started Small turns up again in Stroszek, but this film is much more impressive than that exercise in chaos and subversion. It's another tale of people who don't fit anywhere, in this case the almost alien Bruno S. and his dysfunctional adopted family of hooker Eva Mattes and eccentric Clemens Scheitz, who emigrate from Germany to find the American dream only to discover easy credit, unpaid bills, bailiffs, rifles and dancing chickens instead.

Yet for all the misfortune and grim subject matter, it's surprisingly not as bitter and dour as you might expect, with plenty of Herzogian moments that are so unlikely they seem strangely convincing - even when his two leading men rob a barber shop and immediately run to the convenience store across the road to spend their ill-gotten gains. It also has one of those unexpectedly prescient moments where Bruno S and Eva Mattes are talking about America's national parks where Grizzly bears run free...

The film is light on extras but does feature one of Herzog's excellent audio commentaries.",1166140800,2,1194,5.025252525252525
1408004,4,B000059PPT,"Werner Herzog, world reknown film maker and producer received the lifetime achievement award at the Sarasota Film Festival in April 2006. His films are primarily fictionalized documentaries. He adds fiction to bring focus on a larger truth by exaggerating events and making a bigger statement to prove his point. Herzog based the story of ""Stroszek"" on several real life events, some murders in Wisconsin and a street musician (who plays himself) who lived in Berlin, who was the son of a prostitute, who had been raised in reform schools and ended up in prison. He is lost in the real world because it is totally alien to him. Herzog provides an unusual cast of characters, many of whom are not actors, but play themselves, mostly working class (Wisconsin mechanics and Indians) and street low lifes (thugs in Berlin) who live unusually simple lives, just making ends meet in the world. The extra features include audio commentary with Werner Herzog who explains some of the innovative ideas on which he based the film. This is a tragi-comedy where no matter what improvements in life the main characters attempt, fate intervenes to twist them in a different direction, usually downward. There are humorous and ironic events which makes this a fascinating film from an artistic and creative aspect.

We meet Bruno Stroszek as he is being released from prison, he is given his belongings: cash, a flugel horn, his accordion and a lecture from the prison warden. The warden has a thankless job but when he sees someone released it brings him some measure of satisfaction: he lectures Bruno, to stop drinking beer which makes him crazy and break the a law. The warden tells him to buy a cup of coffee and a piece of pie instead. Bruno returns to the former apartment he shared with an eccentric elderly gentleman. He resumes relations with his prostitute girlfriend Eva, who is beaten up by street thugs. This event provides the impetus to emigrate to the United States, to Wisconsin, where the elderly gentleman had an American friend or cousin with whom he kept in touch.

In the US, Bruno gets a job as a mechanic, Eva becomes a waitress. They buy a mobile/trailer home and television set by taking a loan from the bank. It does not take long before they fall behind on their payments. They receive a visit from the bank loan officer, a very polite man, who makes it clear in the kindest of tones that unless they meet their obligations, the bank will confiscate their home and TV. Eva returns to her former way of life, finding clients at the truck stop restaurant, to provide extra money to pay the loan. Bruno falls into a funk, realizing no matter what they do, they will not make ends meet. Eva ends up leaving with a group of truckers to Canada ... Bruno and the elderly man go on a robbing spree, to get money in order to eat. It happens to be Thanksgiving, so the irony is they rob a store to buy a turkey. The elderly man is caught and arrested. Bruno's car breaks down but he obtains the truck from the mechanic's shop and goes on a driving rampage. He ends up at a Wisconsin tourist trap where he takes a ski lift type ride on which he sits and goes round and round. Prior to that he had turned on several of the exhibits in which different animals perform various tricks. The last scene is one of the most humorous and creative endings which earned Herzog fame. It depicts in a surreal manner that for some the American Dream becomes a bizarre nightmare from which there is no release. The film will appeal to those who are interested in unusual innovations and creativity in filmmaking. There is a lot of irony and off the wall humour which may appeal only to a selective audience.

1408005,4,B000059PPT,"I watched the film twice in a row, the second time with the director's commentary, which added quite a bit.  The director tells us that the lead character, Bruno, was just playing himself, often improvising, and had a miserable childhood living in institutions.  He seems, to me, to be intelligent, hapless, and so odd.

The only professional actor I remember in the film is the woman playing the leading female role, Eva.  She plays a German prostitute who gets mistreated by her pimp.

The rest of the cast is non-professional.  Bruno is just a very odd man.  The pimp is what he appears to be in the film, a tough guy who enjoys hurting and humiliating people.  The elderly lunatic who accompanies Bruno to America is just that, an elderly lunatic.  The minor characters are just people who were recruited or happened to be around during the shooting.

It's an interesting story.  They flee from Germany to get away from the dangerous pimp who harasses them.  They take a boat to New York City and show us the view from the Empire State Building, a magnet for tourists.  The only time I went up there was at the insistence of a tourist friend I was showing the town to.  Then they go across country to Wisconsin.

I'm happy for them that they have escaped the abuse they were experiencing in Germany, but they end up not doing well in America either.  Bruno is a mess, what can I say.  He's an interesting mess though.

The main reason I put on the director's commentary was to find out why he spent so much time showing a dancing chicken at the end of the movie.  Well, he disappointed there.  Instead of explaining why the scene was there, he just said how much he loves the scene, and then let it play in its entirety without a word of explanation.

That is one hell of an odd scene, that dancing chicken.  You'd think it would be symbolic of something, and perhaps it is.  Symbolic of the animated senselessness of our lives?  Or of Bruno's?  I really can't say.  Unfortunately, it is one of those cases where the artist doesn't explain himself, and just lets you take out of it whatever you want.  I hate that.  I hate when artists refuse to explain what they meant.  Maybe he was just enjoying the sensation of watching a dancing chicken.",1160352000,2,2247,4.492574257425742
1408006,5,B000059PPT,"Stroszek is not the film to watch if you are interested in special effects, slick Hollywood production values, studied, disciplined acting or uplifting, action-packed entertainment. In fact, some scenes appear to have been improvised. Its unpolished feel might be attributable to the claim it was allegedly written by Herzog specifically for its star, Bruno S., within a span of four days. This suits the film's style rather well, however, since its principle characters, Bruno Stroszek and his two friends, are nearly destitute and are not especially well established in their community. (Contributing to this is the fact that Bruno S. wasn't really an actor by trade)  An alcoholic, ex-con loser in Berlin, Bruno Stroszek decides the United States is where his fate lies, so he heads for the Land of Promise with Eva and Scheitz, two disillusioned people who also believe in the dream of US salvation. Leaving Germany is not a very difficult decision for Bruno because he has but one worthwhile, earthly possession: his beloved piano. He believes the rewards of moving to the US will more than compensate for the loss of his piano. The US is the destination for many people because they believe in the promise it holds. After arriving here, all one has to do is work hard and one's dreams will all come true, correct? The dream does not come true for everyone, including millions of native-born citizens, because it is not as simple as that. No matter where Bruno Stroszek is in this world, he would have a difficult time making it because his survival skills are deficient. A baby will clasp its hands onto something and cling for dear life out of instinct, yet instinct alone will not suffice in order to succeed in life. Somewhere along the way, Stroszek has lost either some of his instincts or his ability to survive. I don't see this film as being anti-American because Bruno and his friends make some very poor decisions and their fates are decided by what they bring upon themselves. Tragically, their situation is contingent upon their location because they would not make these same decisions if they did not completely believe in the promise their location brings. So what is Herzog's purpose for making the film, if not an anti-US diatribe? It is ironic that so many US citizens have longed to leave the US since george bush was chosen as president in 2000. Are we that confident in our abilities to survive or thrive anywhere? Are we that full of hubris that we believe US citizens can maintain our lifestyles no matter where we live? Or perhaps we are ignorant of how the rest of the world lives, taking for granted our wages and way of life? There is no perfect place to live. If we are unhappy with our current conditions, we first need to ask ourselves what is the source of this displeasure. Then we must take action to change it, even if the difficult reality mandates changing ourselves. Perhaps Herzog was attempting to help his friend, Bruno S., come to this realization? After all, did he not write the script specifically for him? He really is quite magnanimous.",1159315200,3,3088,4.793621013133208
1408007,5,B000059PPT,""" Stroszek "" is much more than a frontal punch to the "" american way of life "" and to many points of the U.S.A. culture: in first place we must not forget that Bruno Stroszek is an exiled in his own country. Herzog go beyond the political commentary or the social satire and observes Stroszek's tragic-comic odissey with the eyes of an antropologist and the melancholy scepticism of a romantic poet. Since the same moment Bruno has completed his sentence and he is out of the prison he is in a dead alley like a character of a Kafka's fable, but Herzog's scepticism about modern societies and human condition avoid the bad patch of an pleasant nihilism through the use of brechtian techniques and sardonic humour. With an excellent use of expresionist photography Herzog narrates the process of progressive allienation of his main character who flee to Wisconsin with an ill-treated prostitute and a friend looking for some other place to sprout roots. However, in the same moment he arrives to the U.S.A. he begins to get into debt and all his efforts to fit will be useless. Through its sometimes haunted images ( I think immediatly in the ""delirious"" scene of the chicken dancing an histrionic country song, an expresionist commentary about the situation of absolute uprooting and feeling of absurdity of Bruno) Herzog reflects perfectly the mad culture of a country that has sweeped away the bigger part of his past and has invented inconsistent myths and sponsored the publicity to cover this "" hole "", in the context, for other part, of a character who look for an option to the old Europe. Like in Herzog's "" Jeder fr sich and Gott gegen alles "" Bruno S. incarnates a presumed unadapted annuled by the arbitrary rules of men and the ""industries"" they have built up in the name of the cosmic boredom.

  In short, "" Stroszek "" is a devastating look towards teh effects of modern capitalism but, over all, a movie that reflects the worries of Herzog about human allienation and condtion in the new societies.",1153008000,,2013,4.72934472934473
1408033,5,B000059PPT,"This is truly a touching film, and I am certain that the director's commentary is even MORE touching to listen to with the film as it explains so much about the lead actor, Bruno Schleinstein (""Bruno S."").This movie is very much based on his life. I read today in the news that he died just a few days ago at the age of 78 (he died on August 11, 2010 -my original review as written in 2006), and I was so sad to hear this. I feel strongly that Werner Herzog changed Bruno's life for the better by his association with him and having him in his movies, and I know that Herzog must be a truly kind person to see and appreciate the humanity in someone like Bruno. Bruno Schleinstein appeared in two of Herzog's films. He was first discovered by Herzog in a documentary about marginated street musicians. I find it so interesting and so very admirable (genius, in fact) that Herzog used some ""real"" people as opposed to using all ""real"" actors for his film. By ""real"" people, I mean those individuals who he found something interesting or extraordinary about but who were NOT actors.

Bruno Schleinstein was the illegitimate son of a prostitute who never wanted him or loved him. He was beaten by her severely and then placed in a home for mentally ill and retarded children at a very young age. He was essentially discarded by his mother. Bruno remained locked up in various institutions until the age of 23. During all those years, he never had anyone visit him. When I bought the DVD,  I had never heard of the movie or Bruno Schleinstein or Werner Herzog, but I took a gamble and made a great discovery. I am just now becoming familiar with Herzog's films and cannot wait to see some more films that he has made.

The thing that struck me most about the real Bruno Schleinstein was that despite the AWFUL hand he was dealt in life, he never lost his humanity. He did not become very angry or overly bitter and destructive -to the contrary, in fact. I think that says a lot. Bruno wanted love more than anything -something that most of us have experienced with family and friends but that many of us take for granted. Who can imagine growing up without anyone to love you, nurture, and comfort you? I cannot. Bruno was a kind, sweet, gentle soul. Since he had been so long without love in his life, he formed attachments with inanimate objects that he owned like his accordion and his piano.

Now, I don't mind watching a foreign movie with English subtitles, but I must confess that I had to watch this movie twice and then listen the director's commentary to really and truly appreciate it. I happen to know quite a few people who have immigrated to the United States in recent years and I can appreciate what Bruno and his two companions must have felt when their dreams of a better life did not become a reality. Bruno's companions are a down on her luck prostitute named ""Eva"" and an older man, Mr. Scheitz.

I watched it with my husband and he found it depressing. I guess some folks don't like reality...they want an escape. ""Stroszek"" is not an escape from reality. It is a much too painful reminder. But there is still some beauty to the film. The hard thing to determine here is when things start to go wrong and the reason for that. I suppose that some things were just not meant to be for Bruno and his two friends. The painful question here is: why?  Sadly, Bruno was not equipped to deal with the real world. Neither was the prostitute, Eva, who became his girlfriend. Much like Bruno, Eva is also very damaged. Unfortunately, she goes back to her old ways.

Make sure you watch it at least once with the director's commentary on to appreciate the film even more.

And yes, the ""dancing chicken"" is awesome, as well as a lot of other great ""finds"" that Werner Herzog was so thoughtful to have included.

RIP, sweet Bruno S.",1151539200,3,3836,4.452991452991453
1408034,3,B000059PPT,"'Storszek' is a film by Werner Herzog about and down-and-out struggling German citizen who moves to the United States in order for a better life.  He brings along a prostitute and an older man to live with him in the states.  There is really nothing special about this movie.  Many important things from the plot are either left out or just plain confusing.  The film has a good message in showing that life in America is difficult and frustrating too, and that the streets are not paved with gold in this country.  The movie has a really annoying ending where a chicken is dancing while loud hillbilly music is playing in the background.  From what I have seen from Werner Herzog, his films can be divided into two categories.  First are his films Klaus Kinski, which are actually really good and worth watching.  All his other stuff is pretentious gargabe and a waste of time.",1148083200,4,878,4.619354838709677
1408035,4,B000059PPT,"Stroszek, the most accessible film by the mythic Werner Herzog is both a fish-out-of-water comedy and an symbolic commentary on American culture.  The three German immigrants who journey to America in search of a better life find life to be just as hard as in their homeland.  The American Indian who hangs out with them, (and who is featured on the DVD cover) is perhaps the most symbolic figure in the film.  He is both a native and a foreigner to the white American world.  He has learned to deal with the pain of being a foreigner and how to blend in.  Stroszek could not assimilate, and the final twenty minutes (which could be one of the finest ending sequences in film history)  ambiguously shows how a crazy culture can inspire the most even-handed man to do crazy things.",1128902400,7,780,4.575539568345324
1408036,5,B000059PPT,"Stoszek is a extraordinary patchwork of reality and fiction, German and English, introspection and extroversion. It's many unique images do not go away: a bottle of water that captures a live Breugel-like snow scene, rifle-toting farmers on tractors defending their strip of land, a wizened little man testing fence posts with a voltmeter, and the truly haunting ""Dancing Chicken"". Herzog, with the eye and ear of a poet, captures these and more, including the unforgettable and weighty performances by the many amateur actors.

Most welcomed of this DVD is the commentary track by Herzog. It's like watching a second film. To see the same images while hearing his stories deepens the impact of Stroszek. We learn the fascinating backgrounds of the curious individuals involved: the dangerous Hamburg Prince, the compassionate doctor in the Preemie Ward, Al the trucker-pimp, Clayton the beer-swilling mechanic, the unnamed ""extras"" in the fields and truck stops of Wisconsin, and, of course, Bruno S. himself.",1126310400,21,1010,5.352201257861635

1408039,5,B000059PPT,"""Stroszek"" is probably German director Werner Herzog's best film. It's a strange, unpredictable, and oddly funny movie. It's about a Berlin ex-con, Bruno Stroszek (played by a real-life disturbed street musician, Bruno S.), his prostitute girlfriend Eva, and his borderline-senile landlord Scheitz. After being repeatedly terrorized by Eva's pimps, they move to Wisconsin to live with some of Scheitz's friends and, hopefully, encounter the American dream. Revealing any more of the plot would be a crime. ""Stroszek"" not only has a terrific, haunting performance by Bruno S., but it contains the most fascinating depiction of America I have ever seen in a movie, as well as one of filmdom's funniest bank robberies.
The DVD has ""Stroszek"" in an aspect ratio of about 1.85:1. It's a bit grainy towards the beginning, but overall it looks pretty good, especially in the Wisconsin scenes. Of the extras, the most interesting is Herzog's commentary, basically an extended interview with a film historian named Norman Hill. It's a very fascinating blend of production tidbits, information about Bruno S., and some of Herzog's trademark tall tales. Also included are production notes (with are actually devoted more to film analysis and Herzog's relationship with Bruno S. than they are to production), a worthwhile Herzog biography, and a German trailer.",1106784000,21,1349,5.367924528301887

Bruno S., the unknown soldier of cinema once again gives one of the finest performances I've ever seen. Eva Mattes is also wonderful as the prostitute Eva who along with Bruno and Herr Scheitz decide to emigrate from Berlin to Wisconsin to fulfill the elusive American dream. This tragicomedy is one of the bleakest films I've ever seen and also one of the funniest.

That said, I hesitate to describe any more about this truly odd film -- if you can predict from one minute to the next what will happen, you are much closer to Herzog than I am. The most amazing thing, everything follows in a very logical way from what goes before.

Test: how did a cop come to radio his base with this request: ""We've got a truck on fire, can't find the switch to turn the ski lift off, and can't stop the dancing chicken. Send an electrician.""

I was enchanted with this movie, and not just because I grew up in Wisconsin and recognized many of the types of local folks Herzog found for this truly unusual movie. All three of the major characters are superb -- and Bruno S. is truly over the top.
