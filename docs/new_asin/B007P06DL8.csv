5102346,5,B007P06DL8,Paul Simon needs no introduction and his greatest work of all Graceland is explored in many dimensions. From anti racism activists to Sir Paul Mc Cartney and Hugh Masekela. You get let into the controversy that occurred at the time and see the critics question Paul about supposedly exploiting  African musician working on this masterpiece. You also see short clips of recent versions sung by the original artists that help create Graceland. One for the fans and even the casual observer. Highly recommended.,1341100800,18,508,5.120481927710843
5102347,1,B007P06DL8,"I'm not sure why anyone would pay $25 for this BD, when this film is included on DVD with purchase of the 25th anniversary of the CD.  So you get both the music disc and the film for $15.  Don't get the logic here.",1339200000,22,214,3.840909090909091

5102350,4,B007P06DL8,"This documentary celebrates the 25th anniversary of Paul Simon's great Graceland' album. At the same time it questions Simon's political choices in going to South Africa to record during the U.N. approved cultural boycott, seeking to keep South Africa isolated and thus put more pressure on the white regime to step down.

Simon's reply is that artists shouldn't be subject to arbitrary political decisions - they must follow their heart and muse first, and he did more to help raise awareness of South Africa by going than by staying away.

The film doesn't take clear sides on these questions and that's fine, a documentary doesn't have to take sides on a morally complex issue to be successful.

But there is something a bit slippery in Simon's somewhat pat answers that seem to be given a pass. And a meeting between Simon and Dali Tambo, the South African head of 'Artists Against Apartheid' feels awkward and staged, each man explaining to the other their point of view on what happened, ending with what felt like a very forced forgiveness hug.

Is the film letting Simon off too easily? Or is his very awkwardness Berlinger's point? (even his embraces of the musicians who played with him on the album sometimes feel like they might not have happened if there wasn't a camera rolling) .

One interesting detail; Simon took first credit on all the music, even though - as we hear some of the original pre-Simon instrumentals from the album - we realize that many of the songs are almost identical, just somewhat re-arranged by Simon. Taking first writing credit could be seen as an act of hubris that the film never mentions or questions.",1454976000,,1645,4.798586572438163

5102354,5,B007P06DL8,I had  no idea Paul Simon was so courageous.,1440374400,,44,3.888888888888889
5102355,5,B007P06DL8,"This is a great examination of the process Paul Simon used in making his groundbreaking album Graceland.  What makes this even more special is taking the issue of going to South Africa during the artistic boycott without the permission of the African National Congress head on.  The musicians, for the most part, are amazing and deserve the international notice they got from the Graceland experience.  I hope you get a chance to see the miracle that became Graceland.",1437091200,,468,4.9743589743589745

5102366,4,B007P06DL8,"I was young when Paul Simon released the album ""Graceland"".  At the time, I had no idea of the controversy and significance of this album or the ties to Apartheid in South Africa.  Interesting to see the views of both sides and how, in controversy and politics, art will tend to prevail and tell it's own story.  Interesting and moving in an unusual way.  It made me appreciate how artists can collaborate even in the face of great odds and danger.  Art and music weave the tapestry of human existence and to see how politicians on both sides of the issue attempt to shape it is enlightening.  People who make music for the sheer joy of it and the release/pleasure it can provide are inspiring.",1402358400,2,694,4.512
5102367,5,B007P06DL8,"I didn't like Graceland in my youth. It was however played heavily at and around rallies and filtering to our house during the mass gatherings that occurred in public squares through the 90s. (I live on a ridge overlooking town called the Berea)

So Graceland is the soundtrack for the end of Apartheid for me; it is also now one of my favourite albums. Seeing footage from the original recordings and seeing everyone involved talk about its impact has only bolstered my love for this album.

Such an incredible, moving movie",1399161600,2,525,4.758241758241758

5102369,5,B007P06DL8,"For me, I like a documentary that involves more information, interviews and a story than concert footage. This doc had what i like. If i want to listen to the music, ill play the cd. This doc kept my attention from start to finish.
This doc has a great story and is really interesting. I loved it.",1392163200,4,297,4.228070175438597
5102370,5,B007P06DL8,Absolutely superb.  Watch it and learn.  Learn from the artists - the politicians never get it right.  I have been listening to the album for twenty five years and this documentary is really in step with the quality of the music.,1384992000,,229,4.536585365853658

5102372,5,B007P06DL8,"I had to get it for my friend who loves Paul Simon. It's good to know the history of the making of this Album. It was not easy in the midst of apartheid, racial tensions were high.  It would be great if we would stop seeing skin color and understand we are all created in God's image. Every soul has the same worth. We need to be lovers of souls and not respecters of persons. We all come from the same people on the Ark. (Noah, his wife, their 3 sons and their wives.) What color is a soul? Naked we came into this world and naked we shall return.",1375747200,2,548,3.981818181818182

5102381,5,B007P06DL8,"""Graceland"" has long been one of my favorite CD's, but after watching this documentary of the making of the music, I have an even greater appreciation of what Paul Simon and his African musicians/friends went through to bring the album to fruition.

It is also an important glimpse into a time in history and the grim effects of apartheid.",1360972800,3,339,4.745762711864407
5102382,5,B007P06DL8,great reminder of a wonderful disc of music and what it took to put it together.  I give Paul Simon a lot of credit for standing up to the attacks he had to deal with for putting this music out........and to the African artists who worked with him.  An excellent statement of collaboration and respect.,1359590400,2,302,4.472727272727273
5102383,5,B007P06DL8,"IMHO - it's a great film. it deserves a 5 star rating. i also saw it on PBS this eve and the film had at least 3 full concert song performances at the end. it's a great story and i'm glad it was told.

to the person who gave it a 1 star rating... you've certainly struck a raw nerve in many of us who loved the film :) LOL

your singular 1 star rating had more to do with your disappointing 'best buy' purchase experience rather then the film itself. you got duped and you took it out on the film.

so all of us here are scratching our heads on why would you give this film a 1 star rating.  do you really want no one to see it??? :)

so if you LOVE Paul Simon and his music...wouldn't you want to share it? someone searching this DVD/Blu Ray is going see your 1 Star rating and perhaps not buy the music.

hopefully the buyer will see all of our positive comments and decide to get the DVD/Blu Ray after all :)

check out the film again...if you still don't like it...i'll buy it from you :)",1357257600,5,992,3.9547738693467336
5102384,5,B007P06DL8,"I just saw this documentary on PBS. Wow. I had the Graceland Record when it was first released. What a joy to see the story behind this masterpiece 25 years on! Can't wait to recommend to my music friends.

Friday, November 7, 1967 my first concert was Simon and Garfunkel Show as part of a High School Trip in Philadelphia.  I was 16. I think the ticket cost $1.50 which included the bus to and from Frankford High School.  I was there 10/7/80 at the Tower Theatre show recording in Philadelphia for another amazing Paul Simon show.  I lost track of Paul over the years.

What an experience to return to the story about this beautiful piece of music. But wait there is more... there is the drama around the controversy this Album caused. The politics in South Africa in 1986 were very different than today. As the African musicians told their stories of their experience as much younger men, I found my eyes welling up.  I was reliving their emotional experience with them.  When a piece of film does that to you, creates an emotional response, you will remember that for quite some time. I look forward to seeing it again with friends and learn more about the African music then and now.

Something lost, something found.

And in 2013, still a lesson about standing up for the freedom of others.",1357257600,7,1297,4.556034482758621

This is in my top 3 albums all time, and to see what Paul went through to make this happen, and bring these sounds to the masses is just too much to miss. My wife, who isn't a big fan, loved it as well. No this is not a concert, although there are clips. This is about a moment in history.

5102387,1,B007P06DL8,"I don't know why Paul Simon would make a ""documentary"" that does not include a concert. One of the biggest wastes of money IMO. I bought this expecting a Paul Simon concert, what I got was one of the biggest disappointments I have ever gotten when buying a music/concert DVD or Blu-ray. The only 2 I can think of that come close are a horrible recording of Thin Lizzy I made the mistake of buying and Bad Company ""Merchants of Cool"" The guitarist on that Bad Company concert didn't bother to learn Bad Company songs, but at least Paul Rodgers sounds amazing. This Paul Simon disc is worse however. Maybe I should have read the description better, but without it saying ""This disc does  not contain any music"" it is still misleading. Paul Simon, YOUR FAMOUS because of your music! If you want to add this ""documentary"" to a concert then by all means, do so.

This is almost 2 hours of discourse and interviews about the political aspects and impact of Paul Simon's Graceland album.  What music exists is interrupted by talking heads.

For the ANC, Artists against Apartheid and politicians of all stripes - 0 stars.  Graceland is a key component in the transfer of power in South Africa and to the absence of a blood bath.  The effort to suppress the delivery of the beauty that is Graceland and its African muscians, that is unforgivable.  Much too much time is given to these people who should be ignored today as Paul Simon ignored them 30 years ago.  Communication and beauty change conditions, generate freedom.  Those whose sole interest is and was continuous creation of a problem - force versus force, effort versus effort - generate hideous conditions from which they themselves can profit.  There is another documentary that has much more music, much less politics and is better.
